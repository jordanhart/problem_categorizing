{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally The Digital Camera Holy Grail", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R1M11AM6Q24JIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom line up front:  The elusive compact camera with interchangeable lenses, DLSR Image Quality, DSLR Focusing speed and DSLR performance has finally been made.  It is the GF1.I live in Japan so I have been lucky enough to have been playing with this camera since 18 Sep.  This camera sold out on the first day from Bic Camera in Japan so it is going to be hard to get a hold of one.  Please be aware that this camera is \"region\" coded so if you buy a Japanese version you will not be able to change the menu language to English.This review is equally applicable to both versions of the GF1.  I personally prefer the 20MM (40MM equivalent) f1.7 lens to the 14-45MM (28-90MM equivalent) f3.5-5.6 lens for the following reasons: 1)  Since the m43 is relatively small compared to a full frame sensor you need a fast lens to get shallow depth of fields.  2) As a fast lens it is far more usable in low light situations.  This lens is ~2 to 3.5 f stops faster than the 14-45MM lens.  What this means is that given a certain situation, if you were to select the same shutter speed you would let in 4-11 times more light (Each full f stop change changes the light by 2.  Going to a small f stop doubles the light.  Therefore, you arrive at how much more light there is by raising 2 to the number of f stops. 2^2=4 and 2^3.5 =11) allowing the use of a lower ISO setting or you could set a 4-11 times faster shutter speed to allow you to prevent motion blurring.  3) This lens is smaller so it makes the camera eminently more portable.  What you give up is the ability to zoom with your hand.  There is a work around for this and it is called zooming with you feet.  However, in confined situations, you may not be able to move back are far as you need to.  If this is the type shooting you routinely do then the 14-45MM zoom is probably for you.  For me, and I believe for most people, I like the great flexibility the faster lens gives me and I am not usually constrained by space.  Additionally, the 20MM lens, in my non-scientific tests, appears to focus faster than the zoom.  Both focus fast but the 20MM feels faster.STILLSThis camera along with the G1 and GH1 has the best contrast detection autofocus on the market.  It is as fast if not faster than my Nikon D40 and is almost as fast as my D700.  This is a great technological breakthrough and is what allows the camera to be smaller than a DSLR while giving nearly identical performance.  With this camera you will not miss photos of your children or other fast moving subjects while you wait for your camera to focus.  Bravo.On top of the great focusing performance , this fresh design allows this camera to handle exceedingly well.  In many ways it takes the best of the point-and-shoot (P+S) world and mixes it with the best of the DSLR world.  It doesn't have as many dedicated buttons as my D700 but the Q Menu system works very well and allows for quick changes of most shooting parameters.  There is a detailed menu system but I don't find myself using it very much while shooting.  I feel that this setup allows photographers moving up from the P+S world to feel immediately comfortable on this camera while also giving experienced photographers the control they need to work their craft.  It seems many reviewers find fault with the Panasonic one control click wheel that changes aperture and shutter speed (other cameras have two wheels or have a button and 1 wheel combination).  I actually prefer the click wheel on this camera.  With the other types of setups (which I have on the D700 -- two wheels and D40 -- 1 wheel plus button) I usually have to look away from the scene to find the other wheel or button.  With the setup on this camera my finger is already close by the wheel and I just push it to change functions.I don't know what kind of plastic Panasonic uses on this camera but I love the way it looks and feels.  Also, I think having a red, white, or grey camera is cool (unfortunately only available in black in the US.  The G1 was available in multiple colors but so far the GH1 and GF1 are \"available in any color as long as it is black.\") and this combined with its size makes it look more like a \"consumer\" camera rather than a \"professional\" camera.  With the photographer unfriendly laws proliferating the world, it is nice to have an incredibly capable camera that doesn't look like a professional camera.This is a micro-4/3s camera system.  That has some pros and cons.  The chip is smaller than most DSLR chips.  A full frame (FX in Nikon speak) sensor is ~860 sq mm, a Nikon DX sensor is ~370 sq mm, the 4/3 sensor is ~225 sq mm, and the typical sensor used in a point and shoot range between ~25-50 sq mm.  However, a 2/3 sensor like many TV shows are shot with is ~60 sq mm and a 1/4 sensor like most home video recorders is only ~10 sq mm.  What does all of these numbers mean?  From a \"stills\" perspective the 4/3 format is relatively small when compared to DSLRs.  That means that for the same megapixel rating, the 4/3 sensor will have smaller photoreceptors and that means more noise.  However, the 4/3 sensor is roughly 60% of a DX chip so while this is a great physics discussion, in real life you will not be able to tell the noise difference based on sensor size even with a picture blown up to 100%.  This is born out by the GF1's excellent noise control up to ISO800.  You can also still use shots taken at ISO 1600 and 3200 but those low light shots are usually better turned into black and whites for that noire grainy look.  That is the \"downside\" (not really much of a downside especially when compared to the up side) of the micro 4/3 system.  The upside is that because you have a smaller area to cover, you can make lenses smaller (less weight and less cost).  You also get a 2x multiplication factor on your lenses.  So now that 200mm lens gives you 400mm of reach.  Yea.  However, a down side of the 2x multiplication side is if you want to shoot wide.  You need a 7mm lens to get a 14mm viewing angle and those can get pretty expensive (panasonic makes are really nice and small 7-14mm that is more expensive than this camera).  The point of all of this mumbo jumbo is that this camera takes great pictures and the lenses are smaller than DSLR lenses.  Less weight and smaller size with no practical image quality compromise equals great camera.On thing that is a negative is the slow 1/160 flash sync speed.  This will be very limiting for off camera flash during bright light.  With such a slow sync it will be exceedingly difficult (impossible?) to get shallow depth of fields while lighting.  Most people probably won't use this feature but for those that do it will be a bummer. (Super FP mode and ND filters can help with this though)This camera, also, does not have in Camera IS.  The IS is in the lenses.  The reason that Canon, Nikon, Panasonic do this is they say on-lens IS performs better.  From what I have seen that is a true statement.  However, in camera IS is better than no IS.  Also, this camera can mount lens from numerous other systems.  None of those will have IS.  If you have an on board IS, then all of those other lenses will now have IS.  The Olympus E-P1 does have in camera IS.  The camera has many flaws but that is a benefit.  Also, the E-P2 is supposed to be announce on 31 Oct 09 so hopefully many of the flaws of the E-P1 will be fixed.I also love the face recognition on this camera.  When I am taking group photos, the faces that I really care about are my families'.  Now I can register 6 peoples' faces and it will focus on them.  NiceVIDEOIn many ways, this camera lacks some of the features of a dedicated video recorder and doesn't do the 1080P of the GH1 or have the manual shutter speed control.  So why would I want to use this camera for video.  There are two main reasons.  The first  reason is Depth of Field (DOF).  As I mentioned earlier the micro 4/3 sensor has 4 times more area than the 2/3 sensor used for many TV shows and is 22 times more area than many video recorders.  Smaller sensors = larger DOF.  This makes it harder to isolate your subject from the background by having the background out of focus.  Pay attention to movies when you watch them and you will notice how they shift focus to \"highlight\" their subject.  If you have wondered why you can't do that with a home video recorder, now you know.  If you shoot with a F4 lens on a 4/3 system you will need a .8 aperture on a 1/4 system to get the same DOF (by the way there is no such home video recorder).  The second major reason to use the GH1 is the ability to change lenses.  Right now there are not many micro 4/3 lenses.  However, the micro 4/3 format is so flexible that, with an adaptor you can use just about any camera lens you want (Nikon, Canon, Leica, etc).  The trade off is that you lose autofocus with most non-4/3 lenses.  The ability to change lenses grants two major benefits.  First, you can put all sorts of exotic lenses on.  For example if you put on a 7mm lens, you would give your video a perspective not often seen in home footage.  On a 1/4 sensor of a video recorder you would need a 1.4mm lens to get the same perspective as the 7mm on the 4/3 system.  (Most camcorders are not going to go wider than 4mm which is roughly equivalent to a 20mm lens on a 4/3 system.)  Secondly, you can put exceedingly \"fast\" (a fast lens is one with a low aperture number.  A lower aperture number means more light hitting the sensor so you can run your shutter speed faster.  Hence fast lens) lenses on to get shallow DOF.  You could easily put a f1.4 lens on this camera.  You would need a f0.3 lens to get the equivalent DOF on a 1/4 sensor.Anyway, it is relatively easy to make beautiful videos with this camera.  It does not do 1080P.  However, I don't think that will be a loss to most.  The GH1 1080P files are much bigger, require more post work to achieve really good results, and, from normal sitting distances, most people can't tell the difference between 720P and 1080P.  Also, in the movie mode you can set aperture but the camera will set the shutter speed automatically.  This leads to a caveat that you need to be aware of when shooting movies with this camera.  If you want to use the wider apertures in bright light to get the smaller depth of fields then you will need some neutral density filters to put over the lens.  As a rule of thumb you want your shutter speed to be twice the frame rate.  So you need to shoot at 1/120.  On a bright day at f1.7 you could easily need 1/9600 to properly expose at ISO200 (Well beyond the camera 1/4000 shutter limit).  5 to 6 Stops of ND would get the camera to set the shutter speed around 1/120.  If you just set the camera on automatic it will take care of the exposure for you so you can just press the record button and go.  However, one of the reasons to step up to a camera like this is take some control for yourself and create some art from within.I will finish this review by making some comparison between some other camera choices out there.First, this camera works very similar to the G1 and GH1 so what people have said about those cameras applies to the GF1.  The big difference is the GF1 is smaller, the G1 doesn't do video, the GH1 can do 1080P, the GF1 does not come with a Electronic View FInder, the GF1 separate EVF is not in the same league with the G1 and GH1, and finally, the GF1 does not have an articulated screen like the G1 and GH1 do.GF1 vs GH1 vs G1  vs Olympus PEN E-P1  vs Canon G11 (Not yet released)GF1Pros:Smallest camera in the world with DSLR performanceBlazing focus performanceGreat Picture QualityHD 720P video capabilityCompatibility with nearly every lens every made including Leica, Nikon, Canon, etc (you do need to purchase an adaptor to do this and you do lose auto focus in most instances)Great HandlingCons:No built in EVF (add on not in the same league as G1 and GH1)Live View screen not articulatedHard to findOnly Black in the USWho's it for?:  Anyone who want to have a small compact and lightweight camera that packs the performance and features of DSLR.

Anyone who wants to have a small compact and lightweight camera with great image quality, are not concerned about focus speed/flash and want to use the in camera IS to stabilize non-IS lenses.Canon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCDNote:  This camera has not been release in the US yet.  It was released on 2 Oct in Japan and I got to test it a couple times since then.Pros:Smaller Size than any other camera listed hereAll in one package and lens (28-140MM) no need to buy other lensesDecent detail retention up to ISO 800 (up from ISO 200 for the G10)Optical View FinderArticulated Live View Screen1/2000 flash sync speed!Built in flashBuilt in ND filter on LensRelatively InexpensiveCons:IQ not in the same league as m4/3 camerasNo HD movies (640x480 is the largest movie format)Can't swap lenses (this is both a plus and minus and there are modifiers you can put on to make the lens \"wider\" or \"longer\")Small Sensor (1/1.7 sensor is only 43 square mm compared to 225 for the m43.

However, if shallow depth of fields are your thing then look elsewhere.)Construction quality as good as the G10 (No longer built from metal.  Some people may list that as a pro.)Who's it for?  Anyone who wants more portable camera than any other listed here while still keeping many professional features and is willing to sacrifice a bit on IQ for an all-in-one package with nothing else to buy.OVERALLThe Panasonic GF1 is a fantastic camera and the first to deliver on the promise of a compact camera with DSLR performance and image quality.  It obviously has places in which it can improve.  However, for the current state-of-the-art, this camera is the best performing small camera available.  Panasonic's contrast detect autofocus has raised the bar and no more excuses can be made for this type of autofocus system.  (It probably heralds the extinction of the DSLR)  Based around this, Panasonic has engineered the worlds first compact camera with \"DSLR\" level performance and has created an outstanding stills camera with good HD video camera capabilities.  It's a great time to be a photographer!", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not the holy grail - not yet", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "RN8NY35542YLG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok - so this is hands down the best little camera available right now. But is it good enough? My humble opinion - not so. I bought this camera from Amazon a month ago - with the 20mm 1.7 lens. I have used it for a vacation in Barbados as well as street photography and 'go anywhere' type of shots. Here are my impressions.Pros:- Nice form factor and small size. It can easily slip into a big pocket.- Finally, someone figured out the contrast detection autofocus. It's not perfect. On about 5% of my shots - the autofocus locked but the shot came out clearly misfocused. I found this to be acceptable, though.- The 20mm 1.7 is a great lens - very sharp, very fast and a pleasure to use.- The build quality is good.- The camera feels solid, the controls are generally well laid off, and it is speedy to shoot.- The features offered are on par or above the mid level DSLRs out there.- Good image quality up to ISO 200.- The display is good (especially when compared with the dinky display of the EP1), but not as good as the Nikons and Canons in the same price range (e.g. 3inch, 920k dots).Cons:- Overall image quality came below my expectations - for a sensor close to APS-C in size. It's head and shoulders above a compact camera, but for $900, you can get much better IQ from an entry level or mid level DSLR, especially above ISO 200.- Low light performance is at the level of APS-C sensor a generation or two ago (think Nikon D40, not Nikon D90). This is particularly problematic in the shadows - with significant noise visible at relatively low ISOs - e.g. ISO400. The noise is also of the worst type - chrominance as opposed to luminance.- I do not miss the viewfinder and I would not get the optional EVF for this. You have to get used to a new way of shooting with this camera - in front of you, using the screen in the back for composition. HOWEVER, in order for this to work, one needs two essential things (both missing in the GF1): an electronic horizon level (to make sure you're lining up those shots) and in body stabilization to compensate for the extra shake from not having this camera supported on three points (two hands + your face) as for a DSLR. This was the deal breaker for me. I found that the rule of thumb for DSLR - shoot at 1 over the 35mm focal length equivalent does not work for the GF1 way of shooting. For the 20mm, not image stabilized, to ensure a good shot - I would have to shoot at 1/80s.- Other than the 20mm lens (which is great), all the other m34 lenses out there are too big - they negate the size advantage of the format. So I don't really buy the interchangeability advantage - if you want a small package, the 20mm is going to live on your camera, and you shouldn't really pay an premium over non-interchangeable package such as Sigma DP1 or DP2.- It is overpriced at $900+. The G1 - the GF1's bigger brother (same sensor) sells as a kit for $700. Considering that G1 has a EVF incorporated, and the GF1 lacks that, I value the GF1 kit at around $600. I hope its price settles there after the initial feeding frenzy is over.- If you are serious about image quality, you shoot raw and part of your workflow involves post processing the image. In that workflow, the GF1 is held back by the fact that the in camera choices you make (film modes, contrast correction, etc.) are not carried over to the RAW developer included with the package - Silkypix. You have to start all over again - which is annoying and a waste of time. I wish Panasonic put some resources in developing their own raw developer - like Nikon's Capture NX or Canon's DPP - this way they can carry over the settings once you get to the computer.- If you don't shoot raw, well - you have another problem to deal with - the jpeg engine incorporated in the camera is mediocre at best. The colors are off (especially the blues) and the dynamic range of the jpegs is 2 or 3 stops below what the sensor is capable of.- Crappy flash sync speed of 1/160. This not only applies to the underpowered built in flash, but also external flashes. The GF1 does not offer high speed flash sync like the better DSLRs out there. This is very limiting when you want fill flash on a bright Caribbean day.So, what does this all mean? If you are looking for a small camera to carry around - either get one of the fixed lens packages from Sigma, Leica, etc. or wait until Olympus perfects the autofocus on the EP series. If you are looking for a travel camera - go for an entry level or mid level DSLR - the size and weight difference is not that great and the difference in flexibility and image quality is well worth the tradeoff. The m43 format has potential, but we're not quite there yet.", "Date": "November 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unique camera - Kudos to Panasonic", "Author": "GM", "ReviewID": "R2U2L7K9BNVK0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic portable cam with decent image quality and extraordinary features. It filled the gap between my Panasonic LX3 and Canon 5DMkII as a small size camera with all the features I want. What do you get? Small package; fast great lens (20mm); DSLR IQ; HD movies; fast autofocus (+ face-recognition AF); super looks (+ pride of ownership); very sharp LCD. Importantly, you don't look like a geek when you use it in a group. The colors are very very good (I shoot raw and develop in Panasonic Silkypix in \"Filmcolor A\" mode).Downsides? High ISO noise is not as good as Canon DSLRs (40D etc).  AF area selection is painful, because the arrow buttons no longer can be used for their original functions. Colors of the LCD screen are not accurate. Continuous autofocus in movie mode tends to use f/1.7 & it hunts a lot. This means significant portions of the movie end up out of focus. In some auto modes (e.g.: aperture priority + auto-ISO), camera picks 1/30 exposure time, resulting in blurry photos. Current price is quite high ($900 for body+20mm). These are small nags compared to what you get.Doubts about fixed focal length lens? Fast 40mm-equivalent lens is sufficient for ~90% of my daily shooting needs (family, kids, friends etc). Unless travelling or taking artistic shots, I don't feel the need of a different focal length. I think most casual shooters would feel the same.You may want to consider getting a Lowepro Rezo 60 camera bag. The camera + 20mm fits snugly into that.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very High Marks, Between DSLR & Pocket Camera", "Author": "Lawrence B. Solum", "ReviewID": "R1NUUHD2XKLXOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: This is an excellent camera for its intended use--prosumer controls on a camera that is much lighter than a DSLR but not small enough to slip in the pockets in your shirt or pants.  Outstanding build quality, flexible feature set, good but not superb low light performance.Background: My previous digital experience is with Nikon DSLRs (D3, D200, D70, D40x and with Canon \"SD\" or digital elph pocket cameras (several models).  I am an experienced photographer, shooting both raw and jpeg in all modes (fully manual, automatic, etc).Comments: Like many photographers who use DSLRs, I have been looking for a camera that is easy to carry, but provides the same level of control and image quality associated with DSLR cameras.  The features that are important to me are: (1) full manual control over exposure (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO); (2) useable built-in flash, (3) high quality screen for image review, (4) portability, including both volume and weight, (5) decent low-light performance, (6) excellent image quality from both raw and jpeg files, and (7) design (simple and elegant).  My impression after several hundred images is that the GR1 with the 20mm pancake lens is the first camera that falls within the acceptable range on all my criteria.  Here are some thoughts about specific features:(1) The control system is complex, but can be mastered within a few hours of normal use.  Once you learn to use the control wheel (which can be depressed to switch between modes), it is easy to adjust aperture and shutter speed.  The \"quick menu\" provides easy access to most important features, and the programmable function button is very handy.(2) the built-in flash is usable for \"fill flash\" and for a limited range of situations, but is not sufficiently powerful for most flash applications.  I prefer natural light and rarely use flash for any reason other than fill, so the flash meets my needs.(3) the image review screen is excellent.  I did purchase the external viewfinder.  I find it useable for framing and for for manual focus.  It is not a high resolution screen, but I do not regret the purchase.  After an initial trial period, I now leave it off the camera most of the time.(4) the GF1 just meets my need for portability.  No interchangeable lens camera will fit easily in a pants or shirt pocket, and the GF1 does not.  It does fit in a jacket pocket with the 20mm pancake lens attached.  It can be carried in a smallish purse or bag.  It fits easily in a computer bag, messenger bag, or in a backpack compartment.  It easily can be stowed in a medium-sized or larger camera bag--it is small enough so that it will not displace a significant amount of gear.  Of course, I would be thrilled if there were a camera with the capacities of the GF1 that were even smaller, but I find the tradeoff to be very acceptable.  The GF1 has now totally displaced my current Canon SD (digital elph or Ixus).(5) the low-light performance is acceptable, especially at the 1.7 aperture of the 20mm pancake lens.  Of course, the low-light performance of the GF1 does not come close to the Nikon D3, but the images at ISO 800 are very acceptable and I find the ISO 1600 & ISO 3200 images to be useable--although I am not bothered by graininess.(6) more generally, the image quality is excellent.  In my opinion, the image quality is substantially better than any P&S; camera with which I am familiar.  I have no experience with the new Canon G11 or S90--but I suspect that in some situations the GF1 with the better Micro Four Thirds lenses will have a significant edge over those cameras.  Many of the images from the GF1 have significant \"pop\" or \"wow factor.\"  As is usually the case, the raw files can produce better images with post-processing (I use Lightroom and Photoshop), but I am happy with the jpegs, including the black and white jpegs.(7) the design is (in my opinion) excellent.  I am impressed by the simplicity of the design.  The camera feels very solid and in my (large) hand, it has a satisfying \"heft.\"  Tastes differ, of course, but I believe that many users will find this camera to be among the most aesthetically attractive cameras on the market today--taking into account appearance, ergonomics, and build-quality.Conclusion: The GF1 with the pancake lens is a real step forward in the category of compact cameras for serious photographers.  In my opinion, it is the best camera in its \"weight class\" as of October 2009.  Rumor are flying about new cameras from Nikon, Ricoh, Sony, and others; and Leica has announced the X1--so a case could be made for delaying a purchase for a few months.  But in my experience, the GF1 is a very satisfying camera.  Like many other reviewers, I am using the GF1 extensively in situations where it is difficult to cary a heavy DSLR with multiple lenses.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "compared with LX3, G10, E-P1, dslr", "Author": "hellfire", "ReviewID": "R3SFMZ8TDLANN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i own the canon G10, LX3/D-lux4 (and a canon EOS 1Ds & SD790IS), and spent a LOT of time with the olympus E-P1 in various camera stores manhandling it with different lenses.  i chose the GF1 20mm kit based on1) DSLR-like image quality in stealthy compact form. Granted my 1Ds is 7 years old now, but it was the best camera of its era.  the GF1's files are better than the 1Ds with more ISO options and low-light capability (i took a lot of test shots in camera stores and checked out the files at home before purchasing).  Dxomark would disagree, but on my computer screen, the GF1 is better.  i think a lot has to be said for the latest and greatest noise reduction algorithms, and for a lighter anti-aliasing filter on the sensor.  i'm also pretty sure i can sneak the GF1 into concerts etc where pro-level cameras are outlawed.  it just looks like a big LX3.2) Shallower depth of field than LX3/G10.  I love making dreamy pictures with nice bokeh and subject isolation (my favorite lens on the 1Ds is the 50mm/f.14, and i almost always shoot wide open), and it's tragic that you cannot create those pictures in a small form factor - the closest would be a Leica M9 with 50mm summilux, if you have $10000 to spare.  the GF1 + 20mm 1.7 is a good compromise, and not much worse than an APS-C camera in terms of depth of field increase.  In other words, the samsung NX10, sigma and sony interchangeable lens compacts will likely not have substantially shallower DOF.3) snappy autofocus.  everyone claiming the E-P1/P2's autofocus is on par with the GF1 is smoking something, or aren't sensitive to AF speed (e.g. landscape/portrait shooters).  the GF1 focuses faster than my 1Ds does, way faster than the E-P1, and offers pretty good control over the AF point.  this is critical for street shooting, where you have just a second to compose, focus and take a shot.  the E-P1 just felt sluggish, even when i put the 20mm/1.7 on it.  it felt slower than the LX3/Dlux4 and even the G10.  the GF1 takes pictures when i expect it to, even with focus-priority...i couldn't say the same for my time with E-P1.4) user interface.  although a life long canon shooter, the LX3/dlux4 introduced me to panasonic's UI, and i've found it fairly logical and easy to navigate.  almost everything is just a few buttons away.  in the time i spent with olympus i was completely confused.5) incredible low light performance.  the 1.7 is surprisingly sharp wide open if your subject is distant enough.  this means i can street shoot at about ISO400 at dawn or dusk, 1/100 or 1/250 shutter sometimes to stop motion.  ISO 1600 is amazingly clean to my eye, and beats ISO1250 on my 1Ds.6) lighter than E-P1.  ostensibly they're about the same size/weight, but the E-P1 just felt heavier & bulkier to me.7) handling.  a bit of an x-factor.  it feels good in hand.  although tricky i can use it with gloves.  it starts up almost immediately, whereas the E-P1 runs its sensor cleaning.  the shutter gives a satisfying chunk.  i leave it around neck & shoulder without a lens cap and i can quickly shoot from the waist or bring it up to eye level for composing.  it just feels good to use.  it begs to be used every day.  i think if the GF1 didn't exist, i'd have saved up for the leica M9 and 50/1.4.  the gf1 feels like what the M10 should be (except with a sensor half the size).8) lens compatibility.  there's an adaptor for practically every lens system out there to micro-4/3, including leica M, R, nikon, canon, etc.  i look forward to trying my canon 50mm/1.4 on it (effectively turning it into a 100mm f/1.4!!).  you lose autofocus and perhaps aperture control (modern lenses use electronically controlled apertures), but if you're a rangefinder kind of person, you won't miss it.9) sharper rear display. the low-res LCD on the E-P1 is just not good enough.  i like to adjust/check focus manually, and the high res screen on the GF1 makes it easy.  the E-P1 has to zoom in more to confirm sharpness, and it's just not as usable (imagine being forced to always zoom 10x in the moment you touch the manual focus ring - you have no idea where you are.  GF1 zooms 5x with an option to go 10x).Things that you have to compromise:1) no in-body image stabilization like on E-P1.  in practice, i don't think this matters for my kind of shooting.  the tele lenses that need it will have it for panasonic, but IBIS doesn't help if you're trying to freeze motion, such as in street shooting.2) size/weight.  it's not as pocketable as the LX3/dlux4.  but so much better than lugging an SLR around. i can keep this on me all day and not notice it or want to take it off.3) DOF.  the shallower depth of field can work against you if you need to stop down to get more things sharp in lower light.  there are shots that are more easily taken with the LX3/dlux4 than this or an SLR.  recall that the LX3 has an f/2.0 at wide angle, but because of the roughly 4x smaller sensor, the DOF is much deeper.4) prime lens.  i don't think this is bad, but today's consumer may need some adjustment.  my DSLR always had a 50mm on it.  zoom with your feet.in summary i'm selling my G10, some of my canon lenses, keeping the LX3/dlux4 and GF1.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Big step in right direction but still not quite there", "Author": "Ted Shafer", "ReviewID": "R1DD6RWP05ZL83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Dpreview has an excellent review of the GF1 and I won't elaborate on their technical assessment.I'll focus on the usability of the camera, for me.I've owned about a dozen film and digital cameras, including compacts and SLRs of both types, and like many camera enthusiasts I've long wanted the image quality of an SLR in a compact size.  The GF1 is a big step in the right direction, a very fun camera to use, but it just doesn't quite meet my hopes for portability - the camera + pancake lens still are just a tad too big to comfortably fit in a large pants pocket.  For me this is supposed to be the main appeal of micro four thirds cameras - smaller than SLR isn't good enough, it has to be small enough so that you always take it with you without hesitation.  The whole point of this camera is its compact size, and if you are going to have it dangling around your neck and bouncing around, or tucked into a case or backpack to keep it out of the way, you might as well save a few bucks and get a cheap SLR with comparable image quality.  (I know Panasonic offers the excellent LX3 for true portability).One other minor gripe: there is almost no grip on the camera so I found it a little harder to solidly hold than I would have expected, given its light weight.  A larger grip wouldn't have added any to the overall size since the lens still protrudes far more.Anyhow I still love the camera and especially the super-fast pancake lens - I am enjoying the lack of zoom, forcing me to think a little more about composition.  And, it does fit well in a jacket pocket, so is certainly a big improvement in portability over an SLR.Recommendations for a full kit:- UV filter to protect your $400 lens- Lens Cap keeper so you don't lose the cap- Wrist strap - toss the enclosed neck strap - if you are going to hang a camera around your neck you might as well get an SLR.  This camera is light enough that you can tether it to your wrist- Small bag or case- 8GB or larger card - 1 min of high-res video eats up about 250M- Spare battery (optional - battery life is excellent)Wish-list for Panasonic development team:- a few more fixed length, fast, compact (pancake) lenses - maybe start with 24mm & 80mm (35mm equiv.) to go with the current, excellent 40mm (35mm equiv).  Given that the average GF1 buyer is probably very interested in its small size, killing that advantage with a long zoom lens seems pretty pointless.- make the GF2 even smaller - goal is to have lens + camera that can fit in a large pants pocket- articulated screen would be a nice bonus- better grip", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for an Old Guy !", "Author": "Bass Lake \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "RSUKAAOR614JH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*NOTE: Because there is some active discussion here in the comment area behind the more negative reviews I was asked to cross post my following review. Technically this camera that I am reviewing came with the 14-45 kit lens, but my comments apply equally well here...*I am an 'old fart' and come from the now old world of film cameras.I grew up in 4x5 sheet film and still think 35mm format is a 'toy' .. But since I can no longer effectively use my old 120 roll film cameras like the Zeiss Super Ikonta and Hasses' & Rollies' what to do?I am an amateur with my only requirement being to document my RV trips and the back-country 4WD adventures and the 'less than 5 mile' day hikes, so I may as well use one of these new fangled digital cameras.I always thought my old Nikon F bodies were too heavy for the result they gave and now the new breed of 10 pound DSLRs are even worse yet. It's the same bad trade off today as it was in 1965, nothing has really changed. A ten pound mirror slapping monster with a one ounce result.The GF1 is very much like my old M2 Leica rangefinder. It has all the benefits of the rangefinders, none of the SLR drawbacks. Faster than lightening to bring into play, very responsive, excellent fit and feel in the hand, and very well thought out in design and manufacture. A one pound camera with a ten pound result ! Rangefinder 35mm of this style and design are the ultimate 'candid' and street cameras, and they can not be beat on the trail unless you are hiking with a pack burro to help you along.If you are looking for a modern camera that will do the job the old Leicas' did then this is the one for you. The lens and the sensor and the resultant image quality is excellent. You will have no problem up to 11x14 prints and perhaps beyond. I noticed in the excellent dpreview review of this camera that they have some minor moans and complaints about the JPEG engine in the camera. I do not agree with them on this point. If you set the 'my film' settings in the GF1 correctly you can get an almost indistinguishable color result against a RAW development. Admittedly you loose some image information in the JPEG, and have to experiment a little with it, but once you develop a 'my film' profile for various standard shooting situations then you are good to go and save yourself the later workload of the RAW development.The Japanese software that is supplied as a freebie with the camera is excellent, and very sophisticated. You will not have to buy $300 worth of junk from Adobe unless you want to. Once you get over the 'translation chuckles' of the various menu items in the software you will have a powerful tool in your hands. Admittedly there is a learning curve with any software of this complexity, but it is doable and is a significant value added bonus to the price of the camera.When even the GF1 is too heavy for me to take on the trail, I pocket my Cannon S90. There is no comparison between the image quality of the Micro 4/3s and the little chip in the Cannon. It is the difference between night and day, apples and oranges. If you are one of those that are tired of the 'almost' image quality of your little pocket digital camera but do not want all the same old - same old SLR negatives, then I don't think you could do better than the GF1. Of course this Micro 4/3 world is just in it infancy and and you will probably watch the world pass you by a little as new cameras of this class are released over the next few years, but you will be taking great shots with it now, and having great fun as well.If you are one that used to use, appreciated, and understood rangefinders like the old Leicas, and now watch, with disbelief, the endless profusion of so-called \"pro grade DSLRs \" pour out of Japan then you need to have a close look at the GF1.

I have used many cameras for the past 20 years including film and some of the first digital models.  The GF1 is almost perfect.  It's compact and non-threatening to subjects you're shooting (I walked into a Starbucks with a brand new 400mm lens attached to my big DSLR once and was told \"no photography is allowed here\"... meanwhile a friend of mine with a small camera was snapping away.)  My other camera is a Nikon D300 which takes amazing photos in bright light or low light and I have a good selection of lenses for it.  I've been using the GF1 for a few weeks now and have to say I'm blown away by the quality.  In situations with a good amound of available light I cannot tell the difference between 12MP images from the GF1 compared to those taken with the Nikon. It's that good!  In low light, however the GF1 falls a little short.  But it's not that bad when you attach really fast lenses from other manufacturers.  I have attached a Nikon 50mm f1.2 lens and it gives you that much more in low light situations. Shoot raw and there shouldn't be that much of an issue.  That is one of the great things about this camera. There are adapters available for nearly every lens ever made.  I have attached Voigtlander (leica mount) lenses as well as very old 16mm movie camera lenses such as the angenieux f/.95 Each bring their own style and uniqueness to the camera.

First of all, this camera really depends on your needs, because it's unique and not a do-it-all like some suggested. Let's drill down the tree of what we're comparing to by first highlighting the biggest advantages and drawbacks to the camera.NOTE: I'm only comparing the camera to entry or mid-level DSLRs. It doesn't match high-end DSLRs, and doesn't serve the same functions.Biggest advantages:* Form factor (especially with the 20mm/f1.7) - size and weight* Ease of use - your significant other can get great shots even if he/she isn't into photography* VERY accurate metering - can't blow easy/medium shots with intelligent Auto (but tough shots require more)* intelligent modes just simply get it right 90% of the time - you don't need to be a pro to shoot!* The 20mm/f1.7 lens is just simply outstanding!!Biggest drawbacks:* Expensive (I tend to discount that - memories are worth more than a few hundred dollars)* Poor selection of lenses* No flash button* No viewfinder (or rather, $200 more expensive to get an electronic one)Things I don't care about:* Build quality - it's super solid, but I don't think it or any other camera would survive a fall to concrete.* Weak flash - all internal flashes are weak, but they're convenient.* The manual sucks - but practice makes perfect anyway* movie mode - give me a break! All cameras today are pretty much the same, some shoot full 1080p HD but low frame rate, GF1 only shoots 720p - but they look the same to me. If you want to shoot good videos with great quality, get a camcorder.Some comments about other reviews:* shooting with VF is great - but VF is still important for sports shots and more importantly for extra bright days. EVF is more bulky and extra $200* it does have horizon markings and grid* I personally didn't even consider the EP-1 or EP-2 to be competition. Regardless of GF-1 coming out better in most tests, one crucial feature to a m43 is built-in flash. If you have to walk around with an external flash (like on the EP1 or EP2), that negates the whole point of compactness - just get a DSLR.==================Some drilling down to help you choose:* If you are into photography as an art, get a DSLR. They're still more versatile and you'll get more choice of lenses - and you're probably carrying around a significant package anyway.* For portraits this camera (with 20mm f1.7 lens) simply can't be beat. Quality is outstanding and can match mid-range DSLR easily. The bokeh is beautiful! And if it's day-to-day that you want (like catching your kids at the right moment), let's see you do that with a DSLR. It may fire within 0.1sec, but takes 10secs to setup...* If you want your photos (e.g. family photos rather than scenery), you'll have to let others take pictures too. Like strangers taking pictures of your entire family, your spouse taking pictures when she doesn't care to read the 200 page manual - if that's the case, THIS CAMERA BEATS EVERYTHING ELSE BY A MILE!!! Taking pictures with auto settings and using the LCD is Soooooooo much easier with this camera.* Don't know what it is - indoor closeup flash pics just meter so much better than with T1i or D5000.* Contrast focus is fast! Faster than most entry level DSLRs, that's for sure.Summary:Buy a DSLR if:* you don't care about package size* you want diversity and flexibility in what you photograph today and in the future (like taking photos of a basketball game, then go out and take scenery shots) and want different lenses for different tasks.For everything else, this will deliver the good, and then some!!", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best in its class.", "Author": "adyc", "ReviewID": "R3ULW8BOSFVVLC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sold my Nikon D40 a while ago and got the GF1 pancake kit recently.

It's worth the extra effort to process raw photos - the jpgs from the camera are ok, but it's easy to get better color,  contrast and sharpness from raws.The 20mm has excellent sharpness when jpgs are created from raw files, and a very nice smooth look in out of focus areas (nice bokeh). Shooting at f1.7 to f2.8 produces really nice isolation of close subjects from the more distant backgrounds. Great for environmental portraits and general photography.The way Panasonic has designed the operation of manual focus is excellent. You put it in manual focus mode, then turn the focusing ring on the lens, and automatically the image on the LCD is magnified, so it's easy to see enough detail to focus accurately. The focusing is done electronically and moving the lens focus ring produces minor changes in focus, such that it's easy to fine-tune the focus. GF1's autofocus is reasonably fast and very accurate, but it's nice to have manual focus for special situations.The grip on the right side of the camera is a little slippery for my taste, and that's one thing on the camera I think Panasonic could have done a better job on.Exposure compensation is done a bit differently than most other cameras, but it's easy to learn and I've found it convenient and secure in use.I am used to DSLR image quality and I would say that this camera and lens delivers quality very similar to 1.5x (cropped sensor) DSLRs. With the 20mm f1.7 lens I actually prefer the GF1's image quality to that of cropped sensor cameras using typical consumer-grade zoom lenses. I've sold my cropped sensor DSLR and in the future would consider only a full DSLR (Sony 850, etc.).  I do mainly landscapes and general photography. If I was shooting sports or wildlife then a cropped sensors DSLR makes a lot of sense - those are not jobs for a camera like a GF1.Another benefit is for taking this camera on a vacation trip, where you want to get high quality photos, but don't want to take a larger heavier camera, such as an SLR. It's much easier to have around your neck or shoulder than a heavier bulkier camera like a DSLR. Also, it doesn't stand out as much to onlookers - it's much stealthier (at least with the 20mm lens).ISOs up to 400 provide very low noise images. Faster ISOs up to 1600 yield more obvious noise, but still very usable  shots.I like the angle of view that the 20 mm lens offers (equiv to 40mm in standard focal length terms - a moderate wide angle, or 'wide-normal'). Ok for many scenics and ok for portraits wider than head & shoulders. Not fussing around with a zoom is a nice change of pace. Yes some shots that can only be obtained with wider or longer lens will be missed (unless you take the time to change lenses - in which case some shots might be missed entirely), but the simplicity shooting with just one focal length (that happens to be a versatile focal length) has resulted a more pleasurable experience than shooting with a zoom and a higher percentage of 'keepers' for me.VIDEO - I've shot a few videos on AVCHD-lite. The video quality is very good. Audio mediocre at best.  I use Media Player Classic-Home software (virtually free) to play the videos on my computer. I suggest this to my friends to they can play my videos on their PC. Although Panasonic provides software on included CD, not many people will have that! I wonder when Windows Media Player and Quicktime players will finally provide built-in codecs for AVCHD. Maybe it's a competition thing. AVCH-lite seems to me to provide better quality than the alternate format provided in  the camera (mov).", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid camera and lens, confusing user manual, poor RAW editor", "Author": "T.

Other reviewers have noted the utility and sharpness of the Panasonic 20mm lens' and the camera's ability -- with this lens -- to focus quickly and accurately even in poor lighting conditions.  Still others have complained about the user manual, which is thorough but poorly designed (every feature has at least two reference points in the manual, and you have to read both to understand how to use or apply the feature correctly).  And the bundled RAW editor has drawn many complaints for its obtuse user interface and novel use of the English language.  All of this, in my experience, is true.The GF1 may not have the largest sensor, it certainly lacks a big, bright viewfinder, its lenses may exhibit a fairly shallow depth of field and its range of optional lenses may be limited (and overpriced, at least for the moment), but overall, wow.The RAW editor issue can be overcome at zero cost by downloading the latest version of Picassa, which accepts RAW2 images.  The rear view screen isn't as convenient as a viewfinder for composing shots, but it is big enough and bright enough to be used in almost any environment and, after all, you can't have everything.  The manual's shortcomings are due, in large part, to the fact that there are so many features to consider -- if you stick to the essentials, the things you'll use over and over again, and become familiar with those before taking on the more exotic features, you'll do fine.  [Frankly, I find many features to be just plain gimmicky -- not knowing how to invoke the \"Baby\" setting isn't likely to diminish my quality of life anytime soon.  Old age is taking care of that.]The 20mm lens is a gem.  I've never owned a camera that had a \"normal\" (50mm 35mm-format equivalent) lens before.  I use 35, 90 and 135mm lenses with my old Leica and Contax rangefinders and I really thought I'd be more comfortable using the GF1-K kit's variable zoom.  But I bought the GF1-C on the basis of its reviews in Amazon and elsewhere -- and I'm glad I did.  The 20mm lens is a fast \"wide normal\" lens in a relatively flat \"pancake\" form factor (that also allows fairly close macro compositions -- I haven't tried to measure how close one can get before reaching the close-up focus boundary, but it's pretty close.I bought a Voigtlander Leica M lens adapter and am very pleased with it.  Lenses mounted with a Micro 4/3 adapter operate at double their nominal (35mm camera format) value -- so, for example, my 35mm Leica Summilux lens becomes a 70mm equivalent manual lens on the Lumix.  The new v1.2 firmware enables the manual focus assist feature to operate with adapted, manual-focus lenses, and I was surprised at how well this works in practice.  Set the camera in the the \"No Lens\" mode, select Aperture priority, pick an f/stop on the lens, and press the function selector wheel at the back upper right side of the camera and, voila, an enlarged image appears on the rear view screen and you focus using the lens' focus ring.  Roll the scroll button to the right and the image magnification increases again.  I'm not sure how much magnification is offered by this feature, but it appears to be fairly robust -- say on the order of 4X at each of the two magnification stops.The SilkPix software was designed for use by someone who is already familiar with complex, RAW-oriented image editors.  The capabilities offered by Picassa are more than enough for me.  I'd never used a camera that captured RAW mode images before, so I opted to set the Lumix to capture both a RAW and JPEG (Fine) image simultaneously.  It's interesting to see them side-by-side in Picassa; one's initial impression is that the JPEG image is much brighter and more punchy.  The RAW image looks dull and dark by comparison.  I nearly changed the image capture feature to JPEG-only until I noticed how much image detail was lost in the JPEG version.  If you play around a bit with RAW images in Picassa you'll see what I mean.  Start by increasing the fill light.  Also, notice that if you've selected \"Dynamic\" or some other image editing feature in the GF1, these changes will not be carried out on the RAW image presented by Picassa (maybe these camera settings appear in the SilkyPix editor, but I know for sure that they do not in Picassa).  Note also that if you are a Mac user, neither Aperture v2 or the new v3 will support RAW2 image formats.  [Thanks Steve.]If you own older manual focus Leica M lenses, think of the GF1 as a workingman's M9 at about 20% the cost -- value-wise, there's no comparison between the two and, believe me, I'm a big Leica fan (owned them for 35 years now).  Get a big, fast SD card, especially if you capture RAW or RAW+JPEG, and absolutely if you intend to bracket RAW images.  Take a look at a product called Dynamic Photo HDR (you'll need a tripod to take full advantage of this product).  Buy a camera bag (Panasonic doesn't include one in the package -- and at the price they're charging for this camera, shame on them).  You'll sooner or later want a telezoom lens -- but prices are going down, and the 20mm is a better starter lens -- and a better lens overall -- than the one offered in the GF1-K kit.  I can't recommend the optional electronic viewfinder because I've never used it, but I'd hesitate to buy a $200 accessory that isn't, strictly speaking, necessary for anyone to get a lot out of this camera.  The battery life is phenomenal, and I wouldn't invest in a a spare battery unless you are very sure you'll capture more than 350 images/day -- you can always buy one later if it turns out you really need it.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "A wonderful camera for a happy father", "Author": "Starmount", "ReviewID": "R3CFGG8LNBOX4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly to shoot pictures and video of my 1-year-old baby boy.

The size is compact enough to fit it into my jacket pocket or hang it around my neck for all day long. Every time I travel with my baby boy, I need to carry a lot of baby care stuffs with me. I need a camera lighter and smaller without creating too much burden.2. The camera provides decent low light performance up to ISO 800 and ISO 1600 is still usable. My baby is still young and most time stays home. I, therefore, took lots of indoor pictures. The camera handles low light environments very well.3. Shooting HD video give us plenty of fun. As far as I know, this is the only dSLR (except GH1) in the market that offers HD video feature with Auto Focus feature and limited but enough controls. Babies grows fast and they make lots of funny movements. I could not ask my baby to repeat a good movement when I miss one. The camera allows me to switch video mode easily when I catch the moment. It is nice to have both video and camera features in one machine.4. The camera offers fast and accurate auto focus. Babies move constanly and hardly stay still. Occasionally, I missed a couple shots but most of time the camera gives pretty good results.Of course, with the cost of $900, you can buy an entry level dSLR with cheaper price and better image quality due to the bigger sensor size as opposed to four-thirds standard.

My canon 5D with the 24-70 attached is 4.5 lbs. My powershot S90 (new addition to the family) is 6.8oz. The question is, does the camera take photos closer to the powershot or the 5D. Well, the answer is that it is closer to the 5D, and at this weight, a fine camera.First, let me admit that I pretty much only buy Canon cameras. Canon makes excellent cameras and once you are invested in the glass and the user interface of one manufacturer, switching is hard. When we go on vacations, if a stranger asks me to take a photo with any canon camera, I can quickly make adjustments to take an optimal photo in the time it takes for the subject to get back to their position in front of the waterfall. They are usually not even aware I adjusted anything.I bought this camera because I want a camera that is 25% of the weight of my 5D and has decent low light performance. Have I found it? Pretty much. It's not perfect, but it is lovable. And what more can one ask from a piece of camera equipment?The Panasonic camera is not so familiar to me and hence I am a bit slower adjusting the controls. There are certain things I don't like about the user interface: hard to format the card, something I like to do when starting a new day; not great auto-iso adjustment. I would rather go to ISO 800, especially on the camera, versus use a tripod.Auto white balance under tungsten light is poor. Everyone comes out red. I have been using custom white balance, but that's a pain.I don't love the JPEG output of this camera compared to my Canon cameras. Canon cameras have punchy JPEG output. I know it's not the most realistic looking output, but I grew up on kodachrome and consumer Kodak papers and the real world just looks dull to me now.I have been shooting RAW with the GF-1 and trying to learn how to use Lightroom well enough to enjoy that process. My normal workflow is with Aperture but in typical Apple fashion, they don't yet support the RAW files of the GF-1.Video mode looks excellent. I have only tried it briefly. I have owned the camera for all of 1 day.Noise at high ISO is very good. ISO 800 completely usable. 1600 usually ok too. Above that, not so much. My Canon 5D can take a decent photo at ISO 6400. But hey, its 3x the price and weighs 4x as much with glass.The contrast detect autofocus should not be confused with what you will find on a DSLR. It's ok. It's not fast enough for sports. This is a camera meant for street photography, travel, etc.I gave this camera 4 stars because it is a bit of a compromise. I can't help but wish that Canon made it. If they made it, I know the software would be better, the JPEGS would be better and the noise reduction would be better. But kudos for Panasonic for coming out with this thing. We all know that Canon and Nikon have no interest in leading here. They are happy owning the market and don't need to take risks creating a camera for the niche low light prosumer rangefinder leica-nostalgic nuts searching for the perfect 1 lb camera.Should you buy this camera? It depends on what the weight means to you. you can get a digital Rebel and throw on a fixed focal length 28mm f/1.8 lens. That package will weigh about 1.8 lbs and give you just about the same field of view as the GF-1. But I guarantee it will outperform the GF-1 in every way. The price of that package is comparable to this camera. So what compromises are you willing to make in image quality, focus speed and handling for 8 tenths of a pound? yeah, it's a hard decision.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic camera overall...Almost perfect!", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R3OUCWP4V1COIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with this GF1 overall. I also own the Olympus E-P1 so I can't help but compare the two. The build on the GF1 in my opinion is just slightly less as good, or as beautiful? As the E-P1. Opinions will vary on this. I bring up this point mostly because the E-P1 is 100% metal..the GF1 has hard plastic on the top where the hot shoe, shutter is etc. It's no big deal..and even $2,000 SlRs use this sort of plastic but I immediately felt if nothing else, the E-P1 is a bit more luxurious LOOKING. I also owned an LX3 and found IT to look just a tad more SPECIAL than the GF1. HOWEVER to play the other side of the fence the GF1 feels solid as a brick..it seems VERY well made, MADE IN JAPAN vs E-P1 made in China..if anyone cares. Ok so much for looks..that of course is in the eye of the beholder. Finally the review of the CAMERA:I was simply amazed at my first snapshots. I was expecting sort of unrealistic skin tones, Blah greens, blues..as I kept reading how the Oly's colors are so much better especially in jpeg form. WOW WRONG! This Gf-1 takes Stunning pictures Even as jpgs...Realistic color (In my opinion maybe more realistic than the E-P1'S too punchy/contrasty colors outdoors EVEN in jpeg form) If you shoot raw, the GF1 just shines even more. As everyone has written the focus speed is AMAZING, fast as can be..but more importantly seems VERY accurate. I could never really get SHARP pics out of my E-P1. The GF1 blows away the E-P1 in my opinion regarding \"detail\" in pictures. I know maybe the 20mm lens has something to do with this as well. I am also impressed with it's dynamic range so far. I am not getting the blown highlights I got with my E-P1 and I am getting less overall shadow vs too bright sun. Another words to my eyes..the GF1 is taking pics much more as your eye sees the scene,..not Overexposed/dark.In truth I wanted to give the GF1 4.5 stars.. I say that because I find it a bit of a shame that neither the 20mm lens or the body has stabilization. I have read all the reviews how with an aperture of 1.7 you are not going to NEED stabilization in low light...I suppose that is mostly true, BUT the point of these reviews \"I feel are to help people make decisions about a product.\" I find that about 25% of my pictures indoors in semi low light often blur SLIGHTLY because of hand shake..pressing the shutter etc. I know with the zoom you do get the IS but too bad they could not include stabilization with the pancake. Could have been PERFECT! That being said...other than in low light..I am taking the sharpest blur free pictures of my life with this gem. One more semi negative I don't see mentioned much I am seeing a bit more chromatic aberration (Purple fringing on high contrast areas..) than I noticed with my E-P1 oddly with the Zukio zoom..a supposed lesser lens. I read software can auto fix this..maybe they are talking about Silky Pix..I have not installed that as I use CS4 Photoshop. I am REALLY picking though..the pictures on a whole look AMAZING mostly, with very accurate color and actually very LITTLE purple fringing..I just wanted to tell all I have noticed. As mentioned in many reviews the E-P1 does look better at higher ISOs..the GF1 gets a bit of yellowy noise about 800 and above in lower light, where the E-P1 looks cleaner to me. BUT with the bright 20mm lens, I have found that the GF1 at 400 iso may have pics that looks as bright as the E-P1 set to roughly 640-800 iso. So you no need USE as high an iso as you need do on the E-P1 ..to my eyes at least. To sort of sum up, overall pictures from the GF1 they look ..almost stunning. I have NO pictures that I can say look stunning coming from my E-P1. The GF1 feels great to handle..it has an awesome intelligent auto mode..it is much less complicated to figure out than the e-p1, yet equally as powerful or more. The built in flash IS useful and a big plus for the GF1 especially for fill or just to help out a little in semi low light if you like. Battery life seems GREAT much better than the E-P1...screen looks VERY good...movies look great too.I can't imagine anyone NOT loving the GF1 once you get to know it a bit. I am still learning and already, IT is helping me to take some wonderful pictures.I had written a review on the E-P1 and gave it 5 stars too..but now OWNING the GF1 I'd probably have to knock the E-P1 down to a 4. Either camera is actually excellent and they border on \"GREAT\" in my opinion, BUT the GF1 takes AMAZING pictures where in my opinion the E-P1's are more ordinary.though still good too.If you buy a GF1 I promise you it's IMPOSSIBLE to NOT like it or LOVE it..GREAT camera.I highly recommend it!", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great performance in a compact camera body", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R2V6E31H8KENJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic GF1 is a part of micro four third system that employs large sensor and interchangeable lenses. It is very popular among enthusiasts because it is one of the smallest m43 camera in the market. It is usually compared to Olympus E-P1 or E-P2 due to similar size and concept.However, Panasonic GF1 has different strengths and weakneses compared to Olympus E-P1/2. GF1 does not has built-in body stabilization, but it has better performance especially auto focus speed and accuracy. The other advantage of GF1 is availability of built-in flash. Although it is not as powerful as built-in flash in DSLR camera, it is good to have one. Olympus E-P1/E-P2 do not have built-in flash, but the new Olympus E-PL1 has one.BODY & HANDLINGPanasonic GF1 weights 348 g with battery and card. The dimension is 116 x 71 x 35 mm. It is thinner and smaller compare to regular DSLR camera such as Canon T2i. It is just a bit bigger and taller than advanced compact camera such as the venerable Panasonic LX3. But if you mount GF1 with a long lens, then it will be more like DSLR camera, without a viewfinder of course.Compare to Olympus m43 cameras, Panasonic does not employ in body image stabilization. However, many Panasonic zoom lenses have lens-based image stabilization. It causes two major implications. First, prime/pancake lenses do not get image-stabilized. Second, most of Panasonic zoom lens will be longer than Olympus'.Panasonic GF1 has one thumb dial and four-way controller and one customizable function buttons. To change major setting such as ISO, AF mode, White Balance is very easy because there are dedicated buttons embedded in four-way controller. There is also a dedicated quick menu button. In addition, GF1 has dedicated movie recording button.I find GF1's interface has many similarities to that of LX3, so if you have use that compact camera, then it will be easy for you to adapt. But there are a few differences such as thumb dial replaces small joystick.The thumb dial is used to change various setting depending on shooting mode. For example, in manual mode, you use it to change aperture value. Then, you can click the dial and change the shutter value.  In aperture priority mode, you use it to change aperture, and click to change exposure compensation. I find it is less efficient way to change setting compare to its E-P1/2 which has two dials.LCD SCREEN & ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDEROlympus E-P2 has 3' LCD screen with 460k dots. It is the same as LX3 but better than Olympus E-P1/2 and many beginner DSLR. It is clear and good enough for composition. In bright light condition, it is harder to see from LCD screen because of the light reflection.To overcome this problem, Panasonic offers optional viewfinder for GF1. I haven't test it out. But looking from the spec (201k dots), it is significantly worse than G1 viewfinder or E-P2's optional external viewfinder (both has more than 1.44 million dots).IMAGE QUALITYImage quality I get from the camera and 20mm f/1.7 pancake lens is very good. Although the focal length is a bit weird for me. 20mm (equivalent to 40mm) is not wide, but not standard/telephoto. So you will need play for a while to get use to it. It is not a macro lens, so you can't really get very close to a subject to get close-up photo.Bokeh / out of focus blur is pleasing at f/1.7. It is a lot better than what you can get from compact camera, but off course not as blurry compare to camera with bigger sensor.Image in high ISO is very good up to ISO 800. At 1600 and 3200, Noise reduction will help to smooth out the noise at the expense of detail and sharpness. However, ISO 1600-3200 is still usable for small web image or regular 4 x 6 print. Compare the images yourself in my Panasonic ISO comparison gallery.New to me is Intelligent ISO function. This is great way to maximize image quality when shooting moving subjects. The camera will opt high ISO when subject is moving to prevent motion blur and then will opt low ISO setting when the subject is not moving.AUTO FOCUS & GENERAL PERFORMANCEPanasonic GF1 inherits fast auto focus (AF) technology from its brother, Panasonic G1 which is awesome. AF is generally fast and accurate even in low light condition. Panasonic GF1 has several focus selection modes. They are Automatic AF, one area / spot, AF tracking, face detection.While I find Auto AF is usually accurate most of the time, sometimes you want to use manual focus for creative purpose. Fortunately, Manual focus is easy to use and very practical because of automatic magnification when you try to focus with MF mode.GF1 general performance is very good. Start up and shut down is approx. 1  and 2 seconds. Shutter lag is almost none. Continuous shooting is similar to many beginner DSLR camera in the market, 3 frames per second.FILM MODEIf Olympus boasts their Art filters, Panasonic calls it Film Mode. It creates different effect or mood in the picture or video. It could really enhanced the picture / video if you choose it appropriately. Here are some mode that available: Monochrome, Retro, Expressive, Dynamic Art, Silhouette,  Pure, Elegant, Custom. Film Mode are not  photo processing after you take picture. The effect is immediate. You don't get access to original file and control on how it is being processed. I think Film Mode is quite fun, but it is not a deal breaker because you can always achieve those effects by processing the image in your image editing software.Unlike Olympus' art filter, Panasonic GF1's processing speed is very fast or almost unnoticeable. On the other hand, It tooks a few seconds for Olympus E-P2 to process an image with any of their Art Filter. To be fair tho, Art Filter effects and Film Mode are not entirely the same.COMPETITORSOlympus E-P1 / E-P2 Price: $600/$1065Olympus PEN series are very similar with GF1. It has the same mount so you can interchange lenses. For example you can use Olympus' m43 lenses in Panasonic GF1 body and enjoy full compatibility. Some important differences include E-P1 has in body image stabilization. Panasonic opt lens image stabilization, but it won't be available to all Panasonic m43 lenses. GF1 has built-in flash, Olympus E-Px have not, and lastly GF1's auto focus performance is better than Olympus cameras especially in low light condition.Samsung NX10 Price: $700Samsung first mirrorless camera is an ambitious and aggresive one. It has best LCD up to date (OLED 3' 600k dots), built-in viewfinder, and CMOS sensor which is bigger than m43 system camera. However, NX10 is bigger, and does not have many lenses in their arsenal yet.Canon T2i / 550D Price: $800T2i is a popular and the best beginner digital SLR camera in the market right now. It has whopping 18 mp image resolution and ability to record full HD video. Auto focus and metering system is also a step better than GF1. Lens collection is a plenty. However, Canon T2i is considerably bulkier.Sony upcoming mirrorless camera Price: possibly $500-700This camera system will be announced soon (possibly May 2010) and it might be GF1's strongest competitor. It will has EXMOR CMOS sensor and will be priced aggressively.CONCLUSIONPanasonic GF1 is a solid camera for everyday use. It is a great tool for beginner and more experienced photographers. Beginners will love it because it has so smart intelligent system that take care a lot of things especially that related to exposure. It is more compact in size relative to DSLR camera but able to produce close to DSLR quality images. Although the price point is quite high, demand for GF1 remains high. I think it is because Panasonic understands what are important for photographers. GF1 emphasizes on image quality, camera performance, and built quality. This strategy pays off, and GF1 may be the one of the most memorable camera in this decade.Subjective Rating - Relative to beginner DSLR cameras 2010Image Quality : 5/5 (with 20mm f/1.7)Features : 4/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 4/5Value for Money : 4/5Please visit my blog (you can find the address on my profile page) for sample images and iso comparison", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "DSLR quality in a small package", "Author": "MatsudaMan \"honestabe\"", "ReviewID": "RALIWO3LR6I9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally wanted to upgrade from my little compact to a full size DSLR.  However, since I'm really into portability, the bulkiness of DSLR's are a big negative.  And after hearing many complaints about extra bags on planes, I knew I had to get something smaller.  So, after much research I decided on the GF1.  What a fantastic camera!  The quality of the pictures (especially in RAW) is simply astounding.  The 20mm 1.7 lens is just perfect on this thing - It's super fast and bright, making it perfect for night shots and indoor photos without a flash.  I can't see going with any other lens like zoom lens in that it would negate the whole size factor of this little gem.  The quality of construction is also incredible.  Comparing it with a Canon t1i or a Pentax k-x reveals its superior fit 'n finish and durability.  I'm embarrassed to admit that I've already dropped this sucker and it literally left a dent on my hard wood flooring but didn't have a scratch on it's all metal housing - fortunately for me, it's super solid.

Before I got into the \"wife and kids\" phase of my life, I was heavily into 35 mm photography.  My current 35mm system is a Nikon 8008 with a full complement of lens that I rarely get out due to its bulk and weight.  In line with the phrase, \"the best camera is the one you have with you,\" I finally succumbed to an weatherproof P&S; (point and shoot) that we took along with us for family events, vacations, ect.  When this camera died on our last vacation, I decided (actually my wife) to investigate higher end digital cameras.My initial focus was upon a DSLR (digital single lens reflex) to replace my Nikon 8008 (i.e., I could use my old lens). In researching cameras to death (my wife was getting irritated at my single mindedness although she knew this when she married an engineer :), I came upon this interesting four thirds format.  Many reviews are out there that explain the details, however, the following points are the ones that had me hooked:-  No mirrors (as with DSLRs) means inherently smaller camera size for both the camera body.-  The four thirds system offers several distinct advantages in also being able to shoot live video over a DLSR.-  Soundless zooming and focusing using a image stabilized interchangeable lens (great for both camera and video applications).-  Sensor size is roughly 6 times bigger than a typical P&S; and 22 times bigger than a typical video camcorder.So interestingly, my pursuit of a DSLR resulted in finding a hybrid system that has the best of both worlds - a camera and camcorder in one small package.  Now on to the economics of what I eventually decided.  I was torn between the Lumix GF1, GH1, and the soon to be released GH2.  I was leaning heavily to wait for the GH2 (Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-140mm HD Hybrid Lens (Black)).  This camera had a big sensor and the coveted 14-140 lens (roughly equivalent to a DSLR 28-280 lens).  I also knew that I wanted the 20 mm, f/1.7 lens (Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras)for shooting in low light conditions.  Total cost of planned purchase $1835.However, I was curious about the pricing trends of both the GF1 and GH1 and so I looked them both up on NexTag.  As is the case with any new product, being the first in line means you pay top dollar.  Buying the old version before the introduction of the new version is a definite bonus for the financially frugal.  So, I ended up buying the GF1 with the 20 mm lens (Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Lens) and the GH1 with the 14-140 mm zoom lens (Panasonic DMC-GH1K 12.1MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video).  In so doing, I got two cameras (each with their distinct purpose), two lenses, and two batteries for $1683.Hope this helps you in your decision process.  I've been putting both cameras through their paces and have been very impressed with their performance and portability.  I am so glad that I took the plunge am enjoying both the art of photography and the new-found art of videography in one elegant package.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Nice \"Tweener\"", "Author": "W.

I was a pro years ago and, since putting down my Hasselblads, I've put a premium on small size. My motto is, \"a picture you take is better than a picture you didn't take.\" I've wathced too many of my friends buy big, heavy, expensive cameras that get left in a drawer. My current pocket camera is a Lumix ZS3 - Love it! Bought the GF-1 in March, took it to China and shot about 1200 pics with it. I was hesitant to take a new camera but figured I could read the manual and learn the controls on the flight over. Well, I took my first 50 shots on the wrong color temp setting! So, be prepared, this camera has a lot more features than a point and shoot and a steeper learning curve. Most of the time I used it like a Hassy with a waist level finder. I shot in the square aspect ratio and used the external viewfinder to look down into the camera. Guess what? Subjects (people) thought I was tweaking the camera or looking at the ground, not taking their picture! I took lots of \"street\" pics of people, many from four or five feet away, and they didn't take the slightest notice of me looking down into the view finder. Yes, I like the Olympus viewfinder better, but this one gets the job done and I don't have a gripe with it. As for the 20mm lens, I wasn't prepared for the exposure bias that the camera software introduces when this lens is attached. In program mode, the software will push the shutter speed up to 1/3000th before it begins to stop down the lens. I presume the assumption is that the bokeh (look it up)is so wonderful that you want as much of it as you can get, but that wasn't the case when shooting outside, so I learned (unfortunately after I got back home) to use aperture priority when I am using this lens. Surprisingly, the zoom has a different and more conventional exposure response in program mode and begins to stop down the lens much sooner. Bottom line, if you're into photography, this one is FUN and it's smaller than a dslr. But, the ZS3 is still the one that's stays with me everyday.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Carpe Diem with an outstanding camera", "Author": "Didier Ciambra", "ReviewID": "R1SAV53WRLSOU2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a lot of online research and the invaluable reviews and online discussions with Brady Fuller, I decided to go for the GF1 - I am not disappointed. In fact, I am extremely happy with this purchase.Just know that I am not a professional photographer, I have owned a Canon Powershot A40 for almost 10 years and I really wanted to go to the next stage in the development of my photographic creativity. Too much of a novice to go straight to SLR cameras - why make the expense when I would not be able to use 10% of the available possibilites to me - I wanted a transitional camera that invites me to explore whilst also giving me point and shoot features so that even my wife and 4 year old son can use.I also wanted something small - I carry a heavy camcorder bag everywhere I go and to be honest, it gets to be a pain in the proverbial bottom!The GF1 just hit the sweet spot - if I was a golfer, I would be talking about this shot for the rest of my life.[...]WOW!The image quality is unbelievably excellent - I feel like I can take professional grade photos. My wife was stunned by the quality of the photos I took of our son. The colors are vibrant, the focus is very fast and the possibilities seem unlimited - especially as RAW images for me to work on later in Photoshop. BTW - the attached software is pretty much worthless and I could not even load it on my Vista 64bit OS.The pancake lens is very good indeed although it is going to take me a while to exploit its full potential. I must also add that I already miss having a zoom capability so I will be buying the 14-45mm lens once I have mastered the camera a little more.I am off to Zion National Park this weekend for a 50th birthday treat with my wife (no son so we will be able to have long hikes and some adult time) - I can't wait to see how the GF1 performs. I do not anticipate that I will be disappointed.For those hesitating on the fence, worried about the price-to-value ratio etc, etc, etc .... my advice - go for it.

I use this camera only with the 20mm lens.  The camera is capable of taking great photos if time is taken to compose the shots.  My main issue is that the camera's ability to focus on the face of the subject during quick snaps is less than perfect.  I've had a number of photos where the camera focuses on the shoulder, arm, or some background item instead of the face of the subject.  When taking photos of a fast moving 4 year old, you don't always have the time to correct the focus.My Pros:- Fast focus; good burst rate (much better than a point and shoot)- Size almost as small as a point and shoot.  Great for travel- 20mm lens is sharp with nice bokeh.  Really nice photos.My Cons:- Often does not focus on the face and because of the shallow depth of field, the face is out of focus in the photos- Focus motor can be heard when taking moviesBottom line: For my purposes, I'm not sure if I would purchase this camera again, but its probably the best option on the market right now that's not a point and shoot.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Civilized", "Author": "Tom o'Bedlam", "ReviewID": "R3QT1BXPEP6Y90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm talking about the Panasonic Lumix GF1 with the 20mm lens.  It's pretty good. There wasn't room in this tiny lens for image stabilization, but I don't miss it much. I love the small size of the camera and lens, and the versatility. The menus are good and mostly user friendly, auto focus good, image quality quite good. You can customize several settings on the rotating dial, but there is one you can't which is the red AUTO setting.  When a photo opportunity suddenly appears, and you don't have time to set ISO, shutter, f/stop, color balance, etc, just turn the dial to the red A and take the picture.One of the reasons I picked this one is that I still have some Nikon lenses that haven't made it onto ebay yet (macro, slide copier, 400) and I have been using them on this camera with good results.  I also do a lot of photography in dim light. I used to use a 35mm f/1.4 lens and 1600 speed film.  So on the GF1, a 20mm f/1.7 lens and ISO 1600 is pretty much the same. It just seemed stupid to spend a lot of money for a DSLR and then put a f/3.5 lens on it. The 20mm f/1.7 lens gives 4 times the light, and is quite sharp.  So while you are shooting with (and having trouble focusing) your 3.5 blurry zoom at ISO 1600, I am shooting with my sharp 1.7 lens at ISO 400 at the same shutter speed, and getting way better quality. Sure, you can zoom, but then your f/stop goes to 5.6.The image quality on the GF-1 goes down as the ISO goes up, but gradually.The manual focusing is kind of silly, but rarely needed. A wonderful feature is a button that magnifies the image for focusing. You can even set the amount of magnification and select an area of the image. I use the accessory viewfinder a lot, it's essential because there are  situations (like sunlight on the screen) where you can't see the screen. It doesn't have as many pixels as the main screen, but it's quite functional. A button on the side switches between, and a little wheel adjusts for your vision +/- 4 diopters. Digital cameras are slowly getting civilized.UPDATE:  The 20mm pancake lens is INCREDIBLY sharp. I'm talking Hasselblad quality! Especially if you stop it down to f/2 or f/2.8 I bought the cheap plastic 14-42 zoom and the sharpness is also good at wide and medium, but like all zooms, it gets less sharp at longer focal lengths. I use it a lot for snaps and other photos where speed and portability are not so important. For those of you who want more speed and sharpness in a zoom, there are some Leica 14-50 zooms, f/3.8 for $500, and f/2.8 for $900. Panasonic just came out with a 14mm f/2.5 pancake lens, and for those who like to shoot in the dark, you can get a Cosina NOKTON 50mm f/0.95 lens. drool.ANOTHER UPDATE: Shot some b&w; low-res video with this camera, and was quite disappointed.

The Canon 50mm 1.4 is perhaps more accurate and certainly lets in more light, butthe 20mm is equally sharp under most circumstances, and the colors (JPEG, havent looked at RAW yet)are less punchy and just more pleasing.PROS:1. Image quality, nearly unbeatable except perhaps by the full-sensor machines.2. Operation is extremely intutitive.  I had the Canon for four years and never bothered to fiddle withexposure or shutter speed or aperture.  With the Panasonic GF1, I just gravitated to Aperture modeand playing with the exposure on day 2---without reading the manual.  The auto mode and auto ISO are also extremely helpful.3.  Screen is very good. I do not miss the viewfinder.  The advantage of the live view is that I change theexposure and immediately see how it would look like.  I wont get this in an optical viewfinder.4. Extremely quick.  Autofocus is brilliant.  It is about twice as fast as the 350D --- not the latest and greatest of the Canon line, but still  a true SLR camera.  Time to shoot and time between snaps is also two to three times faster.  Of course almost no shutter lag.5. Nothing to do with operation or image quality but it makes a wonderful shutter noise after every photo (must be artificial as no mirror is snapping out of the way).

The camera is beautiful to look at and built like a tank -- allmost all of it is metal with a solid feel to it.CONS:1. I knew this before buying, but it is a just a tad too heavy and too big to be really an all-day carry-everywhere camera, even with the 20mm. The problem is not so much the body which is reasonably sized,but the lens. Pancake lens is a misnomer, it is not thin, it should be called a doughnut lens. It adds almost a inch making it difficult to slip it even into a large pocket or even finding the right camera bag (the custom leather one is exorbiantly priced). I seriously considered the S95 Canon for this reason, but there is still a big gap between compacts and serious cameras like this one.2. I could have waited for the GF2 which they say is 20% shrunken on all sides, BUT: I would have to pay nearly 300  more for almost the same specs (video jump is quite irrelevant to me). Although the body is smaller, the pancake lens still lead to the same width problem.  Finally---the deal-breaker---does not come with the 20mm pancake but a 14mm which is slower and just not the right focal length for a majority of situations.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Super capabilities, perfect size", "Author": "hubble15 \"hubble15\"", "ReviewID": "R3QXS5H137QFOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did extensive research before settling on this camera.

The pictures and movies the camera produces are of fine quality, no real complaints.  For an SLR user, the lack of a viewfinder may require some getting used to, but it is a necessary sacrifice to achieve the small size.  IMO the main downside of this camera is the interface.  The menu system is rather convoluted, features like flash exposure compensation require scrolling through a 5-page menu to find the right option.  The 'MY Menu' function is not user-configurable, only storing the several most recent menu accesses.  If you are used to using a Canon or Nikon DSLR, this (other than the lack of a viewfinder) is probably the one big feature you will miss:  being able to access any function you would like to in an instant.  Most of the common features are accessible with a button on the panel, and the Fn button is assignable to one of several features depending on your liking.  But they really need to make the 'My Menu' user-configurable or give you some other way to get at the important features that are otherwise buried deep within a 4 or 5 page menu.  The AE/AF button is also somewhat configurable, but this, one assignable button, and a useless 'My Menu' feature just wouldn't cut it if this were a modern DSLR.

This wasn't the first M43 camera I bought- that would be the Olympus E-PL1 I started with. Good camera, but lacking the solidity and ease of use I remembered from my days with Nikon F2s and Leicas. This camera isn't quite in that category, but it's a solid feeling camera with a metal case, and really well done ergonomics. Even the little details- like how easy (or difficult) it is to get an SD card in or out of its slot- show an attention to detail on the camera that's not there on the Olympus.Yes, this is a three year old design, and if budget had allowed I would have purchased a new DMC-GX1 instead of a used DMC-GF1. But truthfully, you don't give up much with this camera. 12 Megapixel is easily enough for 16x20 prints, with the right choice of subject, and remember that it wasn't that long ago sports photographers were doing full page magazine illustrations with 1.3 Megapixel Nikon D1s! This is an excellent all-around camera for someone looking to move up from compact cameras to a system with lower noise, greater resolution, and interchangeable lenses. It's also great for someone like me who's looking to simplify and reduce the size and weight of the camera gear they travel with.One added thought: If you're going to go to the trouble (and expense) of using a M43 or DSLR, for goodness sake, shoot in RAW mode! Yes, it takes up more space on your SD card than shooting in JPG, but so what? Memory is cheap today. You can get a good 16GB card for $16-20 that will hold more than a thousand images shooting in RAW at your largest image size. Shooting in JPG you lose resolution AND color information.

Live View Shutter Speed & Aperture Pre-shot Visualization - This means that you can visualize the changes (Blur/Stop Motion, Depth of Field, and Exposure) that Shutter Speed and Aperture settings have on the final picture before pushing the shutter release. Excellent learning tool.2. Size - Size difference between this camera and an E-420 is not that great, but it is noticeable. They both cannot fit in a jeans pocket, but while both can fit in cargo/jacket pockets the GF1 can fit just a little bit easier.3. Auto-focus is quieter when compared to the E-420. This means you can sneak up on people and get candid shots.4. LCD displays both the shutter speed and aperture levels along with a range that the camera thinks you can work in for a decent exposure. Again, good learning tool.5. Video - most DSLRs do not include video right now, but this is changing.Disadvantages:1. Auto-focus Speed - Because of the way Panasonic has developed this camera, this disadvantage is actually pretty small. One setting in the camera allows for it to begin focusing as soon as you steady the camera. So while the pure focus speed of a phase detect DSLR (Through The Lens (TTL) Optical Viewfinder Style) is better, the fact that it starts to focus before you press or half press the shutter release button means that this is almost a draw. Also, Panasonic has put a lot of work into making the contrast detect auto-focus (Live View, LCD off the Sensor) much faster than anyone else.2. Shooting in High Light Situations - Because you are only using an LCD screen this can be a problem but there are two solutions: Electronic View Finder (not well reviewed) or you can get a tuck away LCD hood (search: LCD hood) especially designed for the GF1.3. Ultimate picture quality is probably not as good as a DSLR.Compared to a high-end point and shoot (S90, LX3, or G11) it is larger (especially with any zoom lens) but it auto-focuses faster and takes better pictures.Compared to other Micro Four Thirds cameras: Olympus EP Series has in body Image Stabilization but auto-focus is said to be slower. Some people really like those cameras but I think that there is a reason that this one has been sold out for so long. The other Panasonic m4/3 have some advantages, but are really about the same size as a small DSLR.I really like this camera. I purchased both the Olympus E-420 w/pancake and the GF1 and I think I will keep the GF1. The reason I gave it four stars is lack of Optical Image Stabilization with the 20mm lens (it is available on the other Panasonic m4/3 lenses), but if you know how to work around this (and given that the camera teaches you in the process) it should not be too big of a deal.

No zoom and after reading some comparisons with other cameras I felt I overpaid (I could have gotten the same at half the price, or so I thought at that time).Long story short, I now have returned the other camera and I am ordering this one back (just waiting for a refund from B&H;). This may sound silly, but I guess that was needed to know what I really needed. Here's what I liked about this camera and what I did not find in G11 (I am not a professional photographer so I will not/cannot go into technical details).1. Great images. Just taking images in auto settings make super crisp professional looking images! I like that it focuses on the subject and makes foreground and background blurred (just like we see it with our eyes). G11 could take similar images only at highest zoom level with smallest aperture settings and when you come really close to the subject. As a result you could not include a lot in the picture).2. Low light. I was taking pictures in candle light and they looked great! (I should mention that some of them were still a little blurry - but this could be because I did not figure out all the settings). I don't like to use flash so this camera was great. I found G11 taking yellowish pictures in auto mode. In manual mode I can change the settings and it would be fine, but I wanted to take pictures fast without spending 5 minutes adjusting settings manually and taking several sample shots. Again, this might not be a problem for a pro.3. HD video. Took several sample videos and loved them (the only things I did not like was that the camera was autofocusing and sometimes the main subject would blurred for a second. There may be settings to fix this. I did not have time to check.4. Size. Thought G11 is a little smaller, but just a little.5. Speed. After taking a picture with G11 I had to wait what felt to be much longer than GF1 (GF1 feels super fast).So, I am re-ordering it next week and will be able to add more once I have more time to play with it. I compare to G11 only because I ordered it after GF1 and used it for 2 weeks before returning it. It's a great camera but my choice is GF1 (I am even ready to use \"foot zoom\" - this now looks like a small trade off compared to overall performance).I hope this is helpful.Was posted on February 20th, 2010-------------------October 2, 2010 update.We love the camera even more.

When, after five years, my daughter dropped it in a bowl of guacamole and the lens understandably became a bit blurry, I started looking for a replacement. The GF1 is a bit bigger and a bit heavier; even with the 20mm lens (which I would certainly recommend) rather than the zoom, it is more a \"coat pocket\" than a \"pocket\" camera, but this hasn't bothered me a bit.

I'd had Lumix before, and had good experience with them, so that was my first port of call. The Leica lens technology that's in there, combined with Matsushita's own imaging and micro-processor / electronics technology is an interesting mix - top quality in a reasonable price-range. Of course, if you can afford to dish out upwards of $1000 or even $2000, you will likely get better pictures from a Nikon or a Canon... but then you're probably getting paid for your pictures, too! And that being said, I don't know if the pictures are two to three times as good... which is how much more the camera will cost you than the Lumix GF-1. I read the reviews on various websites (the one from Digital Photography Review ([...]) was very comprehensive, thorough and insightful) and kept seeing the Lumix GF-1 come up, with top ratings. So, I took the plunge....... and have never looked back. During the last month since I made the purchase, the camera has met my expectations extremely well, and fulfilled my needs nearly to a T. To keep it short, but hopefully helpful let me go to bullet points...POSITIVES  + solid construction (except the little doors for the power cable (sold separately) and the Remote/HDMI/Digital AV-out connection, which are a bit, well, chintzy compared to everything else... that being said, the plastic doors on my other Lumix survived years of punishment...) The case is metal, and sits well in your hand, without being heavy. All the buttons give good feedback and are easy to use; the lens bayonet is metal, and feels like my old Nikon going in - smooth and solid  + easy to use (well, pretty easy - the manual is 200 pages, and there are lots of various features and variations and options, and this can be confusing at times, but the menus are clear and intuitive. There are just enough buttons on the back to let you do several things quickly, but to not be cluttered. The Quick Menu is great, and I find myself using it more than anything else - it provides access to the most commonly needed functions (focus area, metering area, film type (effectively color tones, including three kinds of B&W;), ISO, flash, white balance, video and picture size, display brightness, file type (2 sizes of JPEG plus RAW) intelligent exposure, and a few others like remaining capacity and positioning of the histogram). Of course you have access to more than 20 pages of menu items to configure, customise and adapt the camera to your needs...  + fast (the focus and shutter release are nearly instantaneous, and data transfer (using Panasonic's own Class 10 cards) is amazingly fast.)  + lens/picture (the sharpness and depth of field are beautiful, and details are remarkable (12.1 MP is a lot, but the 4/3 construction means that each one is bigger so you are able to capture more information...)  + great little size (it's just a tad bigger than a super-zoom p-a-s - reminds me of my Mom's semi-automatic Pentax from 30 years ago... - and decidedly smaller than any SLR on the market [technically, it's a SLR, but without a viewer-mirror and prism - it uses live-view (directly from the sensor) instead])  + great big display (the display is amazing - it's almost like having a TV on your camera! it's big enough to take a good look at shots, and (although I've not done this yet) apparently to edit them in-camera...)NEGATIVES  - it's a bit noisy (the shutter makes a solid (rewarding, but distracting) click when the picture is taken - it's like old-style photography all over again!)  - weak microphone (the microphone is a little weak - it misses some of the bass range, and doesn't have much distance sensitivity... it's a shame there's no microphone jack. And, although I've not had the chance to prove this, apparently the sound of the dials/buttons and aperture changes or autofocus (except with the HD lenses (e.g. the 14-140, which costs more than the camera...)) come through, too...)  - jog dial sometimes too pressure-sensitive (the dial on the back, which can be used to select options, change f-stop or programs, has a pretty stiff rotation, and a slightly less stiff click-function that results in me sometimes clicking when I really want to turn... maybe I've got a heavy hand, though...  - few lenses available (yet) (Panasonic has a good range of lenses (20mm, 14-45, 14-140, 45-200, 45-macro) and Olympus has a few similar ones, but that's about it for now. There are more coming, I'm sure, and with adapters one can use 4/3 lenses and Leica D and M series lenses (with some limitations in functionality). But it's not the palette that Nikon or Canon have for their SLR's...)On the whole, I love this camera - it's revived my photographic creativity and enthusiasm (and brought a whole new dimension to it with the digital aspect) and given me a tool that I can use for nearly anything.

I've gone through countless point and shoots and other small cameras,  such as Canon S95 and Olympus EPL1.  All had the same problem: slow and inaccurate focusing in low light.  I'd have to resort to my DSLRs in low light, which some nights I do not want to carry.  Also we go to a lot of concerts and I want a good camera that I can sneak into a concert.  I saw a youtube review of Panasonic GH2 vs Canon 5DMark1 vs Nikon vs Oly vs some other camera where a user was attempting to autofocus in almost complete darkness.  While most cameras did not focus, GH2 just focused incredibly in low light.  GF1 autofocus system is supposed to be almost as good as GH2 (but not as good).  I thought to myself if GF1 can autofocus half-as-good as GH2, I will be a happy camper.  So I got GF1 when Samys Camera was selling them for $299.  I already had the 20mm F/1.7.  Got 14-42, 45-200 and a viewfinder, and a flash on a way.  What I can say with GF1 is that other than my top DSLRs, like full frame Nikon D700, GF1 autofocusing in low to no light is clearly better than any point-and-shoot I've ever tried and olympus m4/3 cameras.  Majority of the time I use it with 20mm F/1.7 which makes it pocketable.  I get more keepers than with any of these other small cameras.  I use it with 45-200 at concerts and get superb results.  Overall I am pretty happy.  I wish the new generation beyond GF2 will get even better autofocusing speed/accuracy, alike GH2 and better, that will make it terrific.

If that is what you are looking for, this is almost the perfect camera. While it is not going to fit in your pants pocket, it definitely fits in a coat pocket nicely. The other night when I was at a housewarming party for a friend is when I knew I had bought the right camera. Another friend had brought his Nikon 7D and had it hanging around his neck the whole night. I was a bit jealous at first, but when I pulled my camera out from my coat and showed him how great the 20mm 1.7 lens was in the low light and capturing the mood, I knew I had the right camera for me. The 20mm lens helps to overcome the ISO limitations in most situations. I would say keeping the ISO under 800 creates very usable images, and the GF2 doesn't improve on this really which is disappointing. Hopefully the next GFx in the series brings an upgraded image sensor that bumps this up a bit.Using different legacy lenses and using the camera in manual mode has also been a great lesson in photography. It really helps teach you the basics of aperture, ISO, shutter speed, ect. The one accessory I really want is the LVF1, but have been waiting for a refresh on this product for higher resolution(but don't know if I can keep waiting). The LVF would help to improve image stabilization in low light situations.Focus time is a little slow in low light with the 20, but otherwise performs well. I also have the 45-200 lens, which also focuses quickly at smaller focal lengths, but tends to slow down when on the longer end.In body IS is something that is missing from panasonic also.

I've had the camera for a few weeks and I'm still taken back by how very solid and sleek the camera is. It also has a durable, weighty, well-built feel in the hands. Everything down to the battery door opens up with purpose and assertion- the hallmark of thoughtful, high-quality craftsmanship.Performance- What can I say? The camera does what I tell it to, when I tell it to, in the manner which I tell it to. The autofocus is very fast, and when you have to photograph something that's just too tricky for the camera to pick up on, the magnified autofocus assist is a lifesaver for those tricky macro shots. Combined with the f/1.7 lens, it does wonderful portrait shots. Some may be put off by the lack of zoom, but in my experience, a high zoom has seldom made for better pictures. Can you walk in to a dimly-lit bar and take one-handed, no-flash shots with it all willy-nilly? No. However, provided you can get some people to hold still for a few seconds and you know how to steady your hand, you should be able to take pictures in dimly-lit parties with not too much difficulty. For absolute low-light performance, look to upgrade to a Voigtlander Nokton 35mm f/1.4 Wide Angle Leica M Mount Lens - Black . However, if you're strapped for cash, you won't mind holding the camera steady. The menus go by very quickly with minimal lag in between photo deletion and navigation. I like that a great deal.Features- I've never used an SLR camera before, and as such I'm VERY used to setting up composition and gauging contrast using the LCD screen of point-and-shoots. I will say it- I don't like using the viewfinder in the least. To me, one of the hugest benefits of digital photography is the ability to immediately gauge and correct your settings. This camera more fully embraces that benefit by making an LCD-based autofocus quick, responsive and accurate. I enjoy it heavily, but not everyone will.Ultimately- I love this camera. It's beautiful, well-built, small, powerful and compatible with some great lenses if you don't mind shelling out the dough for them. I was intrigued by the way the camera looked, and sold by the pictures I saw people take with it on flickr (there's a very devoted following to this camera on the website if you're interested in seeing the kind of pictures it's capable of cranking out). If you're the kind of customer who cherishes the way a camera looks almost as much as the kind fo pictures it can take- this is definitely the camera for you.

I love the lens and the fixed focal length and prime characteristics are actually very liberating. The quality of the images is good enough to allow some significant post-production cropping so the lack of a zoom is not a problem.I was using a Ricoh GH100 which had good handling but the low light image quality was unacceptable. The GF1 is larger but still pocketable, at least with this 20mm lens.The video quality is good although I would like an external microphone connection.Some of the controls take some getting used to but you can store 4 different user configurations that can be quickly called up that cover most situations and save you from digging deep into the menus. Battery life is OK if you don't do too much monitor gazing and menu tweaking. I like that it behaves as a professional tool that allows you to concentrate on the image. Build is excellent and I look forward to using it as my candid camera when shooting my step-daughter's wedding in November. I also plan to use it for some video clips. Low light quality is very good below 800 ISO although even then, some judicious use of noise reduction software certainly helps. But the lens is fast and the bokeh is very pleasing. The flash is fine for some fill-in when shadows are a problem but I never use it for anything else. However it is a nice thing to have for those occasions when a catch light is needed in the eyes.I always shoot RAW and the files are neutral and allow a lot of variation.Overall I am very pleased with this camera and recommend it highly.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good camera.", "Author": "Ira Solomon \"Old Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3UEUK5BLAQ4CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had digital cameras since they first came out.

Up until owning this camera, I was a point and shoot user, so naturally the images looked fantastic(with some practice and learning the fundamentals of SLR-style shooting). However, as I paid closer attention to what the GF1 could do vs. a mid-range SLR, such as the Canon 60D, I became slightly turned off by the GF1 and 4/3 sensor system, overall.The compact size of the GF1 is nice, and it shoots nice images, but it really can't stack up against most DSLRs equipped with an APS-C sensor. As for the lenses, I liked the pancake since it extenuated what I think is the GF1's strength - being a great portrait/indoor/candid-style shooting camera. Don't bother getting the zoom lens for outdoor scenery. It's OK, but the pictures usually turned out somewhat boring and un-inspirational, especially working with a 4/3 sensor (NOT TO SAY IT CAN'T BE USED OUTDOORS, IT DOES FINE!). I've taken some real nice HDRs using the bracketing feature, but to get an exposure range of -2 to +2, it requires that you take a 7-shot burst! 7! You should only have to take 3! I found this annoying... especially since I had to delete the other 4 images I didn't want.Thankfully, there's a demand out for this kind of camera, and sold it at a good price (especially since it seems that the GF2 wasn't nearly as well received).Bottom line is that this camera is only really great with the pancake lenses, to be used as a portrait/party/generic subject shooting. If you want your pictures to have more substance, complexity, and better low-light noise control, get a SLR with the larger APS-C sensor.
