{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Casio Exilim Z700", "Author": "Amadeus 106", "ReviewID": "R1VLNR6F6XBYIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently my daughter purchased the Casio Exilim Z1000 for me. After putting the camera thru its paces I was completely disappointed. The majority of pictures were noisy/grainy even after adjusting the various ISO setting. Low light situations were a total loss with or without flash. Other customer reviewers on line had similar experiences. I returned the camera to Amazon with no difficulty. Subsequently, I ordered the Casio Z700...and voila!!There is no graininess/noise at any setting. I shot scenes in most modes and varying \"quality\" settings. All photos were sharp and clear. And contrary to other reviews in the video mode, I observed no blurriness/graininess. I am using the 1.0 GB, San Disk Ultra 11 SD card. At the 5.0 megapixel(fine) setting I can shoot 320 pictures; at the (normal) setting I get 470 pix. I highly recommend this camera. As with others, the only downside is the docking station. Since the camera is rather small and slick (feeling) it can readily slip out of your hand if not careful.", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great overall camera", "Author": "B. Pettepiece \"B\"", "ReviewID": "R26197LCHJOQO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife and she loves it.  The main reason I considered it was because of the easy to navigate menus.  Compared to Sony, Canon and Nikon, the menus on this camera make it easy.  This camera is very simple to use and takes great pictures.  Turns on a less that a second and has a super fast button-to-shutter release.  The battery also lasts for a very long time.  We took the camera to Mexico for 9 days and using the camera everyday we never had to recharge it.  We actually used it for a few days after we got back as well.  The only reason we even recharged it is because we were going away for a few days again and wanted a full charge. Excellent buy...", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "ex-z700 (good point and shoot)", "Author": "R. Harmacinski \"notqytryt\"", "ReviewID": "R2BY0OUC2V59FI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to affirm that the ex-z700 takes great photos at iso 50-200. after that it is a bit noisy. but any 3rd party photoshop plug-in noise canceling will fix this. There is one major short-coming to this camera. (if you are new casio cameras..this may steer you away. Older casio models eg: qv-r* series had the ability to shoot in apature or shutter priority. This one doesn't give you these options.  Only way to get around this is to use the \"Best Shot\" mode and find a template that will more or less fit what you are trying to do. Owning many casios in the past I had never used the \"best shot\" mode till now. It does the job but it sorta takes the fun out of playing around with different settings and comparing the results. But what you loose in flexibility you sure make up for with convenience. You can carry this little bugger anywhere and with 7 mpxl image you dont have to have a 8x zoom. you can crop and get very good quality 8x10 photos. that required a 5 mpxl camera to have a 8x zoom to get the same reults. the lens wide open is like a 35mm.. i prefer a 28 or even better a 22 but almost all the compacts are in the 28-35mm range. speed is about 2.8. (still not fast but in line with most other compacts) this is a great camera...want one better..olympus camedia c-7070 (twice the price)Oh i also want to mention that this does not have a optical viewer. (lcd only) another shortcoming but it does have a focus assist lamp. great for low light situations. If you want to buy a very good digital camera on a budget.. orjust like to have a camera around all the time..just in case. you really cant go wrong here. just remember its a point and shoot not a prosumer camera.", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "A powerhouse in a small package", "Author": "J. Rentz", "ReviewID": "RW6UPCDCBNTXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Casio Z700 for my wife who is computer savy, but has beenusing a point and shoot 35 mm for ever.  First off it's so little that it gets some getting used to.  Controls are a bit delicate for my big thumbs. Like the shutoff switch is a little too hidden.  But this all adds up to an impressive camera that slips into a pocket with ease.High points:  First has to be the fantastic large, bright viewing screen.Next is great battery life(and you don't have to carry a tote bag of AA's with you!) The anti Shake feature is a huge help while handling such a small light weight camera. The menu is desplayed big and bright and intuitive.  The Best Shot (preset situations) is great for learners.The docking station for battery charging and downloading photos to the computer via USB is hands free and works like a charm! Reducing photo size for e-mailing right in the camera is a nice touch. The list goes onand on.Low points are few.  Deminutive controls are tricky at first and the zoom lever is sensitive to adjust. When my ageing Sony gives up the ghost the Casio Z700 will replace it.PS I rated it 4 stars because nothing is perfect!", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT Camera!", "Author": "Johnny J.

Super compact, easy to use and easy to upload and manage pictures.  (Techni-friendly) What's the point of buying a really expensive camera that's way too complicated to take full advantage of?  When I decided to upgrade, (I was looking for a few more features) - I didn't hesitate to choose another Casio Exilim because I knew it would give me everything I wanted and still be super easy to use.  This camera did not disappoint and I recommend it to anyone who wants to take great pictures, and enjoy all the advantages it offers.  This camera is easy enough for beginners -- but provides enough great features that even a pro would appreciate it.  Casio also provides great customer support and service.", "Date": "December 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "E. Hendricks", "ReviewID": "R4JJMVZVJY8L6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great! I really researched before I bought, and wound up with the EX-Z700 for many reasons; the price was great for the product, and I really wanted something small.This camera does so many things! The \"best shot\" menu is awesome; you can pick from a list of 38 different settings tailored to what you're trying to capture. Everything from scenery to candlelight tonight scene portraits...pretty much anything you can think of. The menu's are very easy to maneuver, and with very few buttons, it's not confusing. It takes FANTASTIC pictures! They're not at all grainy or blurry, the \"anti shake\" feature really helps when you're riding in a car or anything really that makes for some hand-shaking.I am not all that \"camera savvy\" but I have had a few digital cameras so far, including a few Canon's, and this one is much more user friendly.All-in-all, it's a great camera!!", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great pictures at a great price", "Author": "Gary M.

Easy to use which is a good thing cause the instruction guide is not good. But I was able to figure everything out on my own as it is very easy to use.  The Best Shot feature really works.  I experimented on flowers and it really makes a difference when you use the flower setting as opposed to automatic.  Having fun playing around with it and look forward to many photos.  Also, the battery is the longest I've ever seen!  I've had the camera a little over a month now, have taken well over 100 pictures and it still registers as a full battery!  My Nikon and Canon would have their battery's already charged.  Like the fact that I don't have to take out the batteries to charge.  Just set it in the charging station.

Everyone has commented on how well my photos have turned out.  Outdoor shots turn out particularly well.  I also really enjoy the video option.  The high quality creates files too large to email and I'm still working on how to convert them to smaller files.  The lowest quality video is decent for e-mail but you can't use the zoom or the picture completely degrades.  I love the small size, best shot options and large, bright lcd screen.  This camera would be great for someone looking to get more interested in and learn more about photography and uploading/emailing to web sites and friends.  There are a number of manual settings to play with too.  So far, no real complaints.  I'm your average Joe photographer but I've been very happy with the quality/colors of photos and videos with this camera.

Color Assessment Below", "Author": "Brenda", "ReviewID": "R3T0TFGQT2M19A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit it.  I order this camera mainly for the color.  It was hard to tell what color it actually was online, since it is called blue but looks purple-ish in the photo.  Well, after receiving it I can say that it is not royal purple, as I had hoped, but its definitely some type of purple, probably too much so for someone wanting a \"blue\" camera.  In bright light the camera is sort of a muted dark purple.  In normal light it is more of a royal blue than purple, but with a purple hue.  The color is pretty, but I wish it was more vibrant.Everything else about this camera is great - size, quality, ease of use.  My fiance has a very expensive camera with a ton of functions, but when it comes to simple picture taking, he is jealous of how convenient and high quality my little camera is!  But, all the reviews below will tell you the technical specifics.

The large viewing screen is bright enough that I've never \"blacked out\" on a sunny day.  This is especially important because there is no optical view finder.  The controls are well placed and easy to operate, even with large hands (like mine).  The 7.2 MP make for a great picture.  Another nice feature is the recharging stand/viewer/downloader.  Instead of laying the camera down while wires come out of it, this stand holds the camera at a convenient viewing angle for looking through the contents.  The battery has a nice capacity so it does not need repeated charges.The only downside is one of shape.  It's so small, thin and light it's easy to lose out of a pocket.
