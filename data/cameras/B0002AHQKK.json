{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera Great Price", "Author": "Jo Morris", "ReviewID": "R2BOLUK6LOC81U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Fuji 3600 and it is an amazing camera and when I bought it, it cost about $350. The E500 by Fuji is a camera that is almost an equivalent to the 3600, but cost about half the price. The E500 offers 4megapixel quality, which is more than enough for any normal user. There are 9 different shooting modes, and then there is also a black and white option, and a chrome option. The quality of the LCD screen is the best I have seen on a digital camera, it is much better than the grainy crap that is offered on the HP digitals. The camera has a movie mode that includes sound and it takes an alright video (If you want a movie, buy a camcorder). An interesting thing about the E500 is how it stores pictures on the XD card it uses. I have some pictures already taking some space up on the card and when it tells how many shots are left with the different qualities, it says that there are 194 1mp pics available and 144 2mp pics available. The difference should be larger, but the quality of all the shots are great, no matter the quality setting. The camera also has a very good night mode that will get a ton of use. The pop up flash is a common feature on many of the digital cameras and it isn't a problem (unless you are too lazy to have your finger punch a button). The worst thing about the camera is the time between shots. It takes about 8-10 seconds after the flash of the first shot went off before you can take your second picture. The zoom on the camera is very good. The camera overall is great and I would recommend it for anyone. I bought mine at Niceelectronics.com for about $188 dollars (total including shipping and handling), much cheaper than the advertised Amazon price. And don't waste your time looking at Canon, because their cameras have a fault that is much too consistent for my taste.  In many of their cameras the lens will no longer return to the camera and it will say error F18.  Three of my colleagues have had the same issue at some point or another with the Canon cameras. Fuji and Nikon are the best way to go when looking for a reliable digital camera. This is a great camera.", "Date": "December 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "the Wide Angle capabilities were a big selling point", "Author": "Sam Ostroff", "ReviewID": "R1SMUOHMA8V961", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a digital camera that had an equivilent lense to a 28mm. I was discouraged by so many nifty cameras that only went down to a 38mm equivilent. The difference here with that wide angle is phenominal. The biggest point I'd say is indoor, close up (not macro, but a party for example). Capturing a group of people at a close distance is much easier than having to take steps backwards up to fit every one into the photo.A must have is the docking station. For one thing it includes a couple of rechargable batteries (the docking station is also the charging unit). A big plus for me was not having the hassle of finding the USB cable whenever I wanted to upload pictures to the computer. I find it very convenient. The docking station is not a significant expense, and you're getting an awesome camera at a really great price.", "Date": "May 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "W.

The only reason any of my pictures turn out bad is because I am an idiot who doesn't know how to work a camera or because I don't have something to steady my hand with. The \"macro\" mode takes amazing pictures, and the other modes do good as well.It has lots of options that I don't play with because I don't know what they mean, and if you don't really know much about cameraing the instructions don't help much.  The presets work very well, however.The only bad thing I have to say about the camera is that the zoom can get grainy when it is maxed, but that happens with any digital zoom I hear.Buy one. The Amazon shops have them pretty cheap for what you get.", "Date": "July 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "T. Holbrook", "ReviewID": "R2CEHVIFOOZRR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great size!  I love it!  Takes excellent pictures, fits perfectly in your diaper bag (I'm a new mom).  Colors are so vibrant, love being able to take black and white or color just by changing a button.  I took some black and white photos of my son's feet and blew them up to an 8x10.  I get so many compliments on that photo.  I  highly recommend this camera.  It is easy to use, the user manual and software are well designed.  The only suggestion I make is invest in rechargeable double A batteries.  Also love the larger LCD screen, makes viewing photos easy.  We took this on several vacations and have used it to make holiday photo cards.", "Date": "November 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "L. K. Kingrey", "ReviewID": "R3LDAF80I2HKHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Finepix E500 for a little while now, and I still love it!  I like that its small enough to keep it in my purse and pull it out to take great pictures whenever I see an opportunity.  I also like that it was so inexpensive.  We had a budget of $150 for a new digital camera, and this one was the best by far for the price.  Another plus is that it looks really sleek and attractive.  All my friends say \"oh I love your camera!  It must have cost a fortune!\"...but it didn't ;)", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great all-around camera that produces crisp, saturated photos", "Author": "Robert Davis \"Always 'fixing' something that ...", "ReviewID": "REH4SXYI14HPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter-in-law's raw Fuji photos make my more expensive Olympus 770UZ photos look dull until I run them through Paint Shop Pro...but then the 770's main advantages are a high power zoom and the capability of synchronizing a high power Professional flash unit, which creates brilliant photos.  The Fuji wide angle can get in an entire room if you are looking for a house or taking party pictures.  My Olympus cannot do that, but it can take a photo of an Eagle nesting on top of a cliff or the rapids on the Colorado River from the Grand Canyon Rim!I gave this Fuji to my daughter-in-Law for Christmas with a 256 MB XD chip (then I gave her a 2 Gig XD flash memory card).  She just wanted a \"simple\" camera.  Next thing I know, she has learned all of the functions of this camera and has taken hundreds, if not thousands of very sharp, crisp, well contrasted, saturated, color balanced photos with great white balance to boot!", "Date": "December 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Will not work after a year", "Author": "A. Jones", "ReviewID": "R3SBE2YGFTEHLY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera worked okay.  Pictures were slightly blurred at times, especially when taking them inside.  You have to put it on Auto instead of the people setting to get a good picture of people.  Now, after less than a year later, when I go to take a picture, the camera shuts off right then and there.  The lens doesn't even retract when it does this.  Plus, it has new batteries, so that can't be the problem.  Poor manufacturing and a complete waste of money.  Pool out more money for a better camera than this one.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Marvelous!", "Author": "Daniel Angulo Ch \"dangulo\"", "ReviewID": "R2TWGS9CX8ROMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm stunned by this tinny digital camera!
