{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very short range", "Author": "William", "ReviewID": "R332963TZ2FVX8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera hoping to be able to install it about 25 feet from the receiver. Installation was very easy and I found a spot where I could plug in the camera transformer and still be able to get a good angle of view. However, I was never able to get a stable picture. I used the tuning knob but that didn't stop the picture from flickering constantly. I tried moving the camera and transmitter to new locations. Nothing worked. The units were not near other electronic equipment (other than the small monitor). The only time I could get a steady picture was when the camera and the receiver were within six feet of one another. In my opinion, the camera is totally useless.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "it's decent", "Author": "William Sandifer \"William\"", "ReviewID": "R3OAJ372VOSO2N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you don't expect much then this is the product for you.

Also I could never get the unit to run off the battery for more than a few min's. you can go back unplug the battery and plug it right back in and it works a short time again. Also not sure why but this unit gets very hot (this is probably why battery doesn't run it long). I didn't know unit came with a built in mic til it got here. I find mic is really hit or miss. Sometimes you hear things others it's just static. I'd say it is good for temp, close range surveillance that has a power source. Also the base is not the one pictured it is much flimsier and you have to bend the frame (Not hard) to install the screws. Unless this is on sale, get something else.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremly satisfied", "Author": "Sherlon Collinsworth", "ReviewID": "R27QICV19RJQWU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very discreet and easily set up.Used in basement and picture is great.
