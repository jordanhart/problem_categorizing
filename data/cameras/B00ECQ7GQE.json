If you do not need this feature, I'd recommend saving a price difference of $100 (42%) and get the S6400.I prefer the location of the flash unit (on the right side of the lens) on the S6400 because it can't be blocked by your finger while taking a picture. The S6600's flash unit is on the left side of the lens which may be covered by your finger while you hold the camera.I also like the locations of the play and camera buttons on the S6400, which are placed to the right of the screen for easy operation. The S6600 has these buttons on the TOP of the camera - a necessity because of the articulated screen.The screen size of the  S6400 is 3 inches, while that of the S6600 is 2.7 inches.The screen of the S6400 is touch-sensitive while that of the S6600 is conventional.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This digital camera is very nice.", "Author": "Fabricio Gallo Paulon", "ReviewID": "R2Z0GCRQJRRHJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This digital camera is very nice.My wife is loving.The images is very nice and the quality too.I approved", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ECQ7GQE"}}
