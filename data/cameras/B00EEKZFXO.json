So far the batteries seem to last just as long as the OEM battery. I can't attest to the longevity of these batteries yet which is why I am giving it only 4 stars. If they last at least a year without losing charge or getting swollen then I will revisit and give it 5 stars.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EEKZFXO"}}
