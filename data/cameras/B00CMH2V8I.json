{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera, marginal value on some kit items.", "Author": "owen faler", "ReviewID": "R1VZ2G4O3AMNH2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Excellent camera and very intuitive given the multitude of functions.  Five stars for the camera, three stars for the kit.  I won't bore you about the camera as it is excellent and you can find several excellent reviews on You-Tube to support my findings.  The kit however, has shortcomings:  The camera bag is  cheap and small, the camera strap is cheap, the flash is cheap, the added filters are irrelevant (camera has built-in filter options) and the added micro & macro lens add-ons are probably not much use.  Given the high quality of the camera you are not going to use cheap lens add-ons to deteriorate picture quality, just buy the required lens.  The tri-pod & mono-pod are useful, as well as the extra batteries and charger.  So, overall, this kit is an okay value because of the camera, Pentax lenses, extra batteries and tripod/monopod.  You could buy the camera and key-kit-items for a similar price on Amazon with a little research. My recommendation, is the seller to get rid of the cheap kit items and adjust price.  This is a pro-camera deserving of quality supporting hardware.  The cheap kit items are insulting given the camera quality.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "john a muehe", "ReviewID": "R23ZS0MP3GWPXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "have not taken many pictures only a 100 or so but seems to be as good as advertised.
