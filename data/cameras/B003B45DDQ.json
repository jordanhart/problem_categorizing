{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good beginner digital camera", "Author": "Thomas Raymer", "ReviewID": "R340F2HIM72M80", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy set-up when opened...  using printed owners manual..  More detailed owners manual on cd disc.  Good auto features for taking pictures but easy to override for specific shooting speeds and lighting situations.  LCD screen bright and automatic to light conditions.  Only things the focus could be a little sharper when taking pictures with the auto feature.  Pictures are sharper when setting camera to shoot at a higher, single ASA speed.  3x optical zoom is good and has easy controls on back of camera... good photo  editing of pictures right on camera and body of camera is solid and feels good to hold and take pictures. Good, little GE digital camera.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "simple", "Author": "Meg", "ReviewID": "R1BJ6W6F32P5N7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera is easy to use.

It takes great photos once you transferre them to te computer. It's rugged so you can just throw it in your bag and go and all for under 50 bucks.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible indoor results", "Author": "Atenant", "ReviewID": "R2OBUVGTEU5KKB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a friend who has never owned a camera.  The price at Frys was only $35.  There is a reason for the low price, GE has another model out that is 14mp.  Regardless of the Megapixel, this camera is basically a toy.  There are no adjustments for ISO and the results for indoor is poor.  Outdoor pictures are just okay, and the movie mode works, but not sharp. I cannot recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery compartment broke in 2 months", "Author": "Flanders", "ReviewID": "R1657VD6WHNAN1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera seemed to be fair quality for a month. In month 2 (after the window for returns expired) the door to the battery compartment would not stay closed. Can't really use it with this defect. Disappointed and I wouldn't recommend.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "a lot of camera for the money", "Author": "S. S. \"a reader\"", "ReviewID": "R315TCZUBZKM31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Another 3rd party seller sent me this camera instead of the model I ordered.  It was close enough in features and price that I accepted it as is.  This feature rich camera is the equivalent of much more expensive models by other manufacturers.  The auto flash feature is dependable. Pictures can be blurry, but an unsteady hand is a detriment with much more expensive fare as well.I rate it 4 stars because I have not yet tried shooting indoors enough to be confident of good picture quality.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "would recomend to all", "Author": "Alex  Malaspino", "ReviewID": "R3ECEZRACJKF4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "camera is good value for the price.

I just took it back- maybe GE has downgraded it for 2012.  It takes (I timed it) FOUR TO 6 SECONDS TO TAKE A PICTURE.  First it takes about 3 seconds to get the (already ready) flash set to go, then it takes another 3 to focus.  And the image stabilization is almost worthless.  If you have kids or pets there is no way you can wait 4 seconds to capture a moment.  Plus the surrounding area, when using the flash, appears very dark. PLEASE don't buy this camera even if it's on sale!", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "GE C1233 digital camera", "Author": "GTR", "ReviewID": "R3GV3E9KREJ51Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is similar to the GE camera that I had before.
