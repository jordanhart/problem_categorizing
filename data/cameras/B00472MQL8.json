I took a chance on the X1 and it paid off in spades.  This is a great camera.  I can't imagine what my vacation would have looked like with my D3 and five Nikor lenses, batteries, flash and all of the crap that I could not have traveled without.The X1 is easy to use and focus's on the art of photography and not the technology behind it.  Compose the shot and pull the trigger, that is what it is about.  Setting the Aperture and Shutter speed is easy with two dials on the top of the camera.  I also purchased the external view finder and that made the camera even easier to use.  This camera is very nostalgic in nature and really takes you back to a time where you worried more about composition than you did technology.A couple of issues to think about.  The dials on the top can be easy to turn but not a deal breaker.  I placed the camera in my back pack which was next to a bag of ice.  The camera got so cold that it fogged up when I got it out, my fault not Leica's.I am in the hunt for the M9 at this point, just need to find ten to twelve thousand in disposable income...I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants a great image and easy to use camera.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Nick the photog", "ReviewID": "RS4LT2DD97PMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am usually using my Nikon D700 and several lenses, but after my back was disagree with all that weight I decided to try something smaller. Several cameras were tested over the 6 months period and Leica X1 was way better than anything else - highly recommended. Pure pleasure to make a photographs with this little gem of German engineering.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Leica X1", "Author": "helloKitty", "ReviewID": "R3J1CGVIBP8NKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After debating on what camera I should get, I finally decided on the Leica X1 and don't regret it at all.There's no question that the image quality is great and the lens is wonderful too.The only thing that are the cons of the camera i guess, is that there is no zoom (but is compensated by the great image quality)2. video (if this is a component that is a must, there is no point in getting this camera)3. auto focus is a bit slow.However, I would not trade any of these things for the quality images that I am able to take with this camera.I have the black one, which in my opinion looks much more modern and chic than the steel.The size is perfect and I no longer have to trudge around carrying my heavy dslr.All in all, the camera is meant to take pictures and this is what the Leica X1 solely does.Made with simple menus and easy controls, it helps you do what you love to do: take pictures.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Expensive, but worth it!", "Author": "Donteverwonder", "ReviewID": "R3KEA8B2L51E6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read many reviews about the Leica X1 and its price. I finally decided to purchase it from Amazon in December. I have no regrets at all. I know that this camera has been compared to many other compact cameras, especially the Fuji X100 which is also an excellent camera, but the Leica X1 was perfect for me. I am person who grew up using fixed lens cameras. I loved those cameras! They made your feet work to get the picture you wanted. The X1 does the same thing but yeilds much better results. The IQ of this camera is outstanding and the ISO is great! I own a Leica D-LUX5 10.1 MP Compact Digital Camera with Super-Fast f/2.0 Lens, 3.8x Zoom Lens, 3\" LCD Display, O.I.S. Image Stabilization (Black) and a Nikon D700 12.1MP FX-Format CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only). I find myself using the Leica more, not because it is new but because of the amazing results that I get each time I compose a shot. Using this camera makes me think differently before I take a picture. Whether I use manual settings, apature priority, or shutter priority, the results from this camera never cease to amaze me. I had a chance to work with the RAW files and the results were incredible! I do not recommend this camera to everyone, especially those who are exclusive zoom lens user's, those who wish to shoot videos or anyone who needs a fast focusing lens. This camera does not have these features. I am also aware that the technology of this camera is dated. There are compact cameras with better features and lower prices on the market but the image quality of these cameras may not match up to that of the X1. Remember, sometimes it is not always what is better, it is what you like! Photography is about composition, creativity and expression to say the least. This camera will make you think of these things. If this camera fits your budget and you wish to purchase it, go ahead! You will not be dissapointed!", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best IQ in a compact still", "Author": "mgauss \"mgauss\"", "ReviewID": "R3C68YO6X1ZU0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leica X1 got great reviews for Leica 3D look, no distortion, great colors.
