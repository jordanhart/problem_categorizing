And I am, to say the least, a fanatic about quality.  However, when I saw this camera (looks alone) I had to have it.  The response from other digital camera owners is generally raised eyebrows.  Other reviews here reflect those concerns: \"It's a great camera, but no optical viewfinder?\"  Yes, I thought so myself at first.  But consider the following:  The lens rotates vertically 180 degrees on the camera body allowing the photographer to hold the camera directly overhead - or anywhere down below - yet still see the LCD pefectly.  The advantage?  Complete mastery of that universally dogging fact of photo-life, PERSPECTIVE - the single most important factor in any good photograph's composition.  To my knowledge, the F505 is the very first hand-held camera in the history of photography to accomplish this.  So whatever is lost by the lack of a viewfinder is compensated ten thousand times by this magnificent fact.  Further, when I took my first photo (indoor with flash), my jaw dropped to the floor.  I could read the cover notes on CD cases across the room.  Color?  Absolutely precise.  Frankly, I had never seen anything quite like it.  The new version - the F505v - adds the TIFF format for pros, which places this camera precisely at the pinnacle of its class.  Drawbacks?  There is a slightly noticeable lack of extremely tiny detail in certain type of outdoor images.  And, as with all digital cameras, dynamic range could be improved. But all-in-all, the F505 is, in my view, the hands-down, all around winner.", "Date": "October 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Best purchase I've ever made!", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "RQCKGSH028AQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this in Japan while on a trip through Asia.  Unbelievable quality pictures!  One of the best features is the ability to take pictures which are saved in two resolutions, high res plus a smaller format for emailing.  The memory stick technology is very cool.  It comes with a 4MB stick, but  you can get up to 64MB -- I highly recommend getting a 32MB or 64MB,  especially if you use the dual resolution mode.  Downloading is a snap with  USB connection to the camera, plugging into your pc's serial port, or my  personal favorite, purchase the optional pcmcia card into which you can  plug the memory stick -- similar to using USB.  Takes terrific pictures,  and the video mode is pretty cool, too.  5-10-15 seconds of mpeg video  which you can output directly to tape, or download and edit.", "Date": "February 29, 2000"}, {"Title": "A digital camera with all the right features", "Author": "David Pirmann", "ReviewID": "R3GP2I1CDORJ2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the camera that finally convinced me digital photography was mature enough to use on a regular basis. It has all the right bells and whistles: 1600x1200 max resolution @ 2.1 megapixels, a nice Zeiss zoom  lens, UDB port connection to offload images. The included memory stick is a  little small but Sony sells memory sticks as large as 64 meg, which will  hold 110 images at the camera's best quality, and 200+ images at  \"average\" quality. A couple of memory sticks and an extra battery  make a good kit to travel with. I recently spent a week in Paris and London  and took 700 pictures, offloading them each night to a laptop. I was  thoroughly impressed with the way the camera works and the photos it  produced.", "Date": "April 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great features but missing the most important one of all!!", "Author": "\"secretariat@emeraldis.com\"", "ReviewID": "RAIGND3OIHIOL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "NO OPTICAL VIEWFINDER!!  No serious photographer would even consider using  a dig cam with no optical viewfinder.  The LCD display is ok,  but like  most LCD's it's horrible with any kind of sunlight or movement of clouds  and ever changing patterns of shade.  Sony had a chance to have a truly  great beast here - the 5X optical lens is top of the line,  closeup macro  shots are on par with the Nikon coolpix 990,  the metal frame is very well  built,  but I keep coming back to the lack of an optical viewfinder. Why  build an $800 camera without an optical viewfinder??? Very frustrating -  they have that beautiful optical viewfinder on the DSC-S70,  but no 5X  lens,  they have that beautiful 5X lens on this camera,  but no optical  viewfinder!!  Cmon Sony,  get with it and combine the best features of both  cameras and you'll have a juggernaught!!The 4mb card is completely  useless,  why even bother including it Sony????

Senske", "ReviewID": "R3U2T0V7926FW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the Sony DSC-F505 this past week, and I must say that I absolutely love this camera.  The picture quality is excellent, and it supports resolutions up to 1600 x 1200.  The image sizes range from approximately 100KB/picture at 640x480 up to approximately 400KB/picture at  1600x1200.  The majority of the photos I have taken have been approximately  200KB/picture at 1024x768.  As a result of the relatively large image  sizes, I highly recommend using the USB interface to the camera.  Image  transfers from the Memory Stick are much faster via USB as compared to a  serial connection.  You can also capture MPEG video at resolutions of  160x112 and 320x240.  The unit takes a little getting used to in terms of  holding it comfortably while taking pictures or shooting video, but other  than that it is nearly perfect.  I would highly recommend looking into this  camera.", "Date": "February 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Needs  Optical Viewfinder", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2ND67MPS5447D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has lots of really nice features and is easy to use.  Unfortunately it does not have an optical viewfinder.  This makes it impossible to compose a picture in low light conditions and in certain  angles (to the sun) outside.  This gets especially bad if you wear  polarized sunglasses outside (which black out the LCD display at certain  angles).  The 4mb memory card that comes with it is a joke.  I purchased a  64mb card that works very well.

In long trips you gotta have a laptop  or a couple or more 64mb memory sticks coz it's hard not to take any  pictures with this thing.The  DSC-F505 is also user friendly and the  manual is easy to understand.

After having held it in my hand I heard myself saying: \"You will never get it back\". I have been using Kodak and Ricoh DCs before and there has always been something missing. Resolution, optical zoom, manual settings, light senstivity, a fast computer interface, cargeble batteries, expanadble memory. Yes, none of my prior DCs had it all. But this beauty has! I use it for drawings, paper articles, documenting electric wiring, PC boards (the macro function is invaluable!), nature, grandchildren and night pictures. I could never do that before without the flash, but thanks to the \"night enhancement\" function I have taken som truly great pictures from our Charcoal Stack (a hoby activity) and they turned out great. Think of it, the object is charcoal black and  a faint moon as the only light source!The only thing that I miss is an interval timer so that I can take sequences of pictures over several hours.

Just plug the USB cable in and there you go.Recently we decided to get a \"new\" camera for home, and purchased one of the new sony digital cameras, the P71.

We took it back right away and came here to buy a used f505.Don't be fooled by \"megapixels\", you can have a ton but if they are all shot through a tiny lens, the pictures just can't be that good.
