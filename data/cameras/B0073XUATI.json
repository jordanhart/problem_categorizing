{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GE X500 16MP Digital Camera w/power zoom", "Author": "Robert Hogan", "ReviewID": "R1GLFXDLWOHPTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera two years ago and have used it on three trips to Italy and several trips to national parks in the western portion of the US.  Easy to use and it takes wonderful pictures.  The anti-shake feature really works well as does the optical zoom.  The software that comes with the camera is easy to use and has features not found with much more expensive cameras.  Prices for new GE X500 cameras range from $69 to $200.  My wife was so enthusiastic about the pictures and how easy it was to use the camera and software that I bought her one of her own.  It seems a little light until you put in the four AA batteries.  I fell down a marble staircase in Italy and landed on my camera - broke two of my ribs on the camera but it suffered no damage whatsoever.  A sturdy bridge camera with features you normally get only on a much more expensive camera.  Highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not quite as advertised.", "Author": "Forest7", "ReviewID": "R18EUE9PNSW07V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The GE X500 16MP 15x Optical/6x Digital Zoom HD Camera -Black looks good on paper, and in the several reviews that have shown up so far.  But there are some technical details that might help people in deciding whether to buy this camera.From an online review that I wish I had understood before I ordered this camera:\"As soon as you start shooting with this camera, you'll notice just how slow it is, even for an inexpensive camera. The X500 takes a full 4 seconds to turn on and capture a photo, and needs 4.1 seconds between photos. Those scores aren't good for a camera of any price, bested even by the $99 Kodak EasyShare Mini ($99.99, 2.5 stars), which boots and shoots in 3.2 seconds and needs 2.8 seconds between shots. The real problem here, however, is the 0.9 second of shutter lag, which means that you'll miss an awful lot of moments even after you press the shutter.\"In my experience, the camera does take a long time in its actions, first to take a picture, and second, to be ready to take the second picture.  Plus, the .9 second shutter lag means that the picture you want to take may not even be there when the camera actually takes the picture.These details may be beneficial to prospective purchasers...May 16, 2013 Update:The metal clips that hold the camera strap protrude out so that when the camera is held, they push into your fingers and the discomfort distracts from the camera shot.  I have an older Fuji camera, that has rounded clips that are not noticeable, or in the way.The most important thing is that this camera is \"reconditioned.\"  I did not notice it at first.  I thought I was buying new, but the New box even has reconditioned written on it, and the warranty card is \"reconditioned\" good for 90 days. There is nowhere on this site that says anything other than \"new.\" I bought mine from AceElectronix but which merchant put up the products details is not apparent.I returned the camera.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "GE CAMERA", "Author": "Joe E.

A bridge camera was just what I needed and this one fills the bill. If you are looking for something more than a point an shoot the GE X500 may be what you are looking for. The GE X500 has 16MP AND A 15X optical zoom which was what I was looking for. My old point an shoot only had 4x so I was using the digital zoom a lot.This camera has the ability to be used like a point an shoot in it's auto mode but with a change of the dial you can choose the settings to fit the shot you want to take. Even though I have not explored all that this camera will do I feel confident it will do all that I ask it. It is a professional looking camera and every time I have showed it to someone they are very impressed. So if anyone is looking for a step up form a point an shoot but don't want an SLR this would a great choice.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "disappointed", "ReviewID": "R1USK982J75ROT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Inexpensive with all the bells and whistles and very easy to use.

It worked very good, was speedy and took nice photos until I dropped it by mistake. So, recently I ordered basically the similar GE X-500 camera on Amazon for a decent price. This camera is slightly updated compared to my GE X-5 also sold here. I know this camera has a lot of good reviews and ratings on it...but this camera I got this time around is basically a piece of junk. It takes decent photos, but it's so slow! Camera lag between photos is bad. I thought my old Kodak Z-612 digital camera was slow, but this one is even worse! And this is a brand new camera here! It also has a nagging issue when you take a photo, it produces an \"HTM\" item with each photo taken and I have to delete everyone of those \"HTM\" item when going thru the SD card to clear out the unwanted/bad photos. This camera can take a pretty decent photo and video is fine. The camera is easy to use and looks identical to my older X5 GE camera....but it simply is nowhere as good as the X5. I have given this product a 1 of 5 stars.....this camera is horrid.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Great Price", "Author": "shelly's thoughts", "ReviewID": "R2IN29YV1JAREG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say - its a good little camera!
