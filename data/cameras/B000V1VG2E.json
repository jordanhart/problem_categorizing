{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value, powerful camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1GQ3R25PKD47E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Canon PowerShot A720 IS for about a month now and took a few hundred pictures in various conditions. So I feel ready to write a detailed review of this (great) camera. I'm an engineer by profession and am starting out in amateur photography. I wanted something with enough manual controls so that I can apply what I've learned in photography theory. But I wasn't willing to spend too much on a full dSLR + lenses (yet). Plus I like the portability of a compact camera. I've read a lot of published online reviews on this camera & a few others in its class at the time of purchase. Here are some of my thoughts on each area of this camera that other reviewers may not have covered.Size & Looks:Not as small as the ultra-compacts, but it's very hard to find one smaller with all the manual controls that Canon A series P&S; cameras offer. Having aperture and shutter priority modes and a wide enough ISO range (80-1600) is a must for more creative shooting. If all you shoot is in auto mode (& occasional scene mode), then there are other cameras that are sleeker & smaller (such as the SD series). I personally prefer a darker color, silver on an obviously plastic body is a pet peeve of mine in all electronics these days. Just a matter of personal taste. I wished the camera was slightly lighter & smaller. The main weight should just be a high quality glass lens, everything else can be electronics & plastic. A lot of pros like the Canon G series because of the solid metal frames. But that's mainly because in the dSLR world, everything weighs a lot more. In a portable camera I want portability. Unlike shrinking cellphones & MP3 players these days, the big lens (& preferably bigger sensor size) should be the limiting factor for cameras. I want lenses big enough to let in enough light at the largest zoom and also not suffer from barrel distortion & other abnormalities. Another reason why I didn't go with ultra-compacts that have prizm-folding optics.8 Megapixels:This is on the low end for currently introduced new cameras. But it's more than I (or most people) need. 8MP is enough for all but poster-sized enlargements. Higher megapixels have problems such as denser sensors that have more noise and less dynamic range, and requiring more memory/disk space for storage. More camera buyers should be informed that high megapixels does not mean better image quality, and actually introduces new problems.Zoom:This camera has 6x Optical zoom. I was tempted to get the new SX100 with 10x optical zoom. But I would have to sacrifice the A720's optical viewfinder and slightly smaller size. Also from an earlier Kodak Z712 (12x optical zoom) I owned and sold, the higher zoom was not as appealing as it seemed at first due to a number of reasons such as hand shake (even with IS), slightly less optical sharpness at all zoom levels, and the added bulk. 6x optical zoom is good enough for 90% of the shooting I do without sacrificing size and image quality. A wider wideangle would also be more beneficial than a longer reach (28mm at the wide end instead of 36mm).Optical Image Stabilization:A very important feature in cameras these days, especially with a small lens that could always use more light. I can take hand-held pictures about 2-3 stops slower than without, which means the shutter speed can go as low as 1/10 sec in wide angle without blurring the pictures (while keeping ISO low for less noise). IS is even more important when zoomed in at 6x in all but the sunniest outdoor conditiions, again this is limited by the small optical lens. The more zoomed in, the smaller the aperture, and less light hitting the sensor, so the camera needs a slower shutter speed to expose the picture properly (which means steady hands or tripod), this is compounded by the higher sensitivity to hand shake when zoomed in.Optical Viewfinder:Optical viewfinders are rare among cameras in this class from other brands. Kudos to Canon for including it. The benefits of a viewfinder include being able frame & shoot in sunny conditions that would wash out the LCD display. Also once I have the settings set, I can just turn off the LCD & shoot through the viewfinder for framing to conserve battery power (up to 4x as many pictures taken per set of batteries, 900+ on NiMH) The viewfinder is about 80% of the full image frame, so there's enough buffer for framing error so you can crop digitally later on a computer. The viewfinder is slightly offset from the sensor so it's less reliable for close shooting and definitely not recommended for macro shooting. The A720 IS doesn't have a swivel LCD display, but I prefer it since it only adds cost & bulk to a camera. LCDs today have enough wide angle viewing so they're still usable if I want to shoot from way above or below eye level.AA Batteries:This was a very important factor in my decision when shopping for a digital camera. I preferred standard batteries because I can find them when I'm traveling at any convenient store. The A720 also takes rechargeable NiMH AA cells for everyday use (more environmental, and also more capacity than AA alkalines). The CIPA rating for battery use is about 140 pictures on alkalines and 400 with NiMH. You may get more if you don't use flash & zoom every other shot. I seem to get a lot more shots since I shoot using just the optical viewfinder often, and not much flash. Some cameras (such as my former Kodak Z712 IS) may imply on paper that it can use AA alkaline & NiMH batteries, but they weren't really designed to conserve power. Faster performance usually means having motors and electronics that run at higher power, thus depleting batteries quicker. The A720 actually can use AA alkalines efficiently.Macro:The A720 is way ahead of the competition in that you can focus on objects as close as 1cm (that's less than half an inch in front of the lens!). Also one of the few benefits of having a smaller CCD sensor is that you get more Depth of View (DOF) for macro subjects compared to dSLRs.)Fine tuning:Custom white balance for odd indoor lighting conditions. In-camera adjustment to contrast, sharpness, and noise reduction. I prefer to keep these settings at a minimum so that the original image is captured with the most detail (in-camera contrast & sharpness boosting actually destroys detail). If need to, I can always adjust the image on a computer afterwards, but the more detail I can capture in the beginning, the more I have to work with in post-processing.Some of the issues with this camera that I didn't like are:Small sensor & noise:This is probably the biggest shortcoming that I see in the Canon A720 IS. But the only other viable option is to go the dSLR route and that means spending at least 3x as much (not including additional lenses and associated equipment.) The CCD sensor is only 1/2.5 inch diagonal, this is a very small area for 8 Megapixels. Basically at this point in digital sensor technology, cramming more megapixels into a small area results in less dynamic range (difference between lightest and darkest colors), and noise at anything higher than ISO 200 (which is needed for low-light shooting). I would've preferred a 1/1.8 inch sensor or larger. I get around it by shooting ISO 1600 when I absolutely need to (very dim scenes where flash washes out the background, or the subjects are beyond the reach of flash) and using computer software to reduce the noise afterwards. The results are usable for small prints. Also noteworthy is Canon uses little on-camera noise reduction compared to other manufacturers (a user-selectable setting would be nicer). Which is good, because noise-reduction is a fine delicate process that must balance reducing noise at the expense of reducing clarity too. A process that I would much prefer to do on a full computer with more processing power & updated software than the one included in a camera that has less processing power and is not easily updated.Flash recycle times:Some other people have complained about how long it takes for the flash to recycle after use (it's about 4-6 secs). The main problem I see here is that the LCD goes blank during this time, and I would've preferred that the the LCD be in review mode or something useful so it doesn't SEEM as long. From a technical point of view, I can see how this could be due to using alkaline batteries that provide low power, and to charge the flash safely without depleting the battery too fast with high current. Think of sipping water through a small straw versus a fat pipe. My previous Kodak Z712 had fast recharge time, but it ate batteries like crazy. So I prefer Canon's approach, with some slight tweaking.Actually a better workaround to this is to use off-camera flash. On camera flash is bad because it dulls & flattens pictures, produces red-eye, and makes the background too dim. I ordered a cheap wireless optically triggered slave flash (around $20). (Canon makes a more expensive one that's more compatible in auto modes). Basically it's a wireless flash that fires when another camera flashes in the vicinity. One caveat is that most slave flashes (unless specifically stated) will trigger with digital camera's auto exposure & red-eye pre-flashes. These flashes confuse the slave flashes to fire prematurely. The A720's manual mode comes to the rescue again. In manual mode, I can turn down the on-camera flash and the pre-flash off, relying on one or more off-camera flashes to light the subject and give depth to my pictures. So for me the on-camera flash gets very little use.Histogram not live:The histogram (and flashing blown highlights) is a very important feature for setting the proper exposure manually in the digital world. It allows consistent picture to picture exposure. Otherwise the exposure is set automatically depending on whether the camera scene has a bright spot or not (e.g. noticeable when you shoot with the sky in one frame and another without.) The A720 displays a histogram in review mode and when holding the shutter button in single-shot mode. But a live histogram would've been better so that I can adjust aperture/shutter/ISO and see how it affects the scene. Apparently a live histogram is possible with the CHDK firmware mod on older DIGIC II based cameras (A720 uses DIGIC III, so no mod is available currently).Other minor gripes:Video (up to 640x480 30fps) does not use the modern MPEG4 compression algorithm, so only allows up to 60 mins worth of video with 4GB of memory. Also the optical zoom is disabled when shooting video (supposedly to prevent the motor noise being picked up). I would've preferred the camera allowing this and I can either process it out of the video later with software rather than having to stop recording, zoom to a new angle, and then resume recording. I haven't recorded a lot of video, but one option would be to set the optical zoom to a close enough distance, and then while recording, use the digital zoom for better composition. But zooming in digitally seems to just blow up the pixels instead of increasing resolution. If video performance is important, then I would look elsewhere, or get a dedicated video camera that has a lot more zoom & recording time. What is nice is the continuous image stabilization of the A720 while recording video, it makes everything look like it was shot professionally on a hollywood movie camera cart.No adjustment for LCD brightness. Even though I shoot with optical viewfinder mostly, sometimes I have to use the LCD and would prefer to set the brightness to low or high depending on need for battery conservation or in bright environments.Some minor color fringing at the corners in contrasty scenes when zoomed in maximum. Not much worse than other digital cameras though.As you can see, I'm starting to get very picky about the camera. Overall it takes great pictures and at a great price. I did a lot of research and the longer I use the camera, the more I'm pleased with how much I got for the money. It's more of a camera for those who like to play with settings so their pictures stand out. If you rely on auto modes, then another camera may serve you better (I can't speak much for it since I don't use auto often except at social events when I hand it to someone else to take a snapshot while I'm in the picture.) Relying too much on auto modes can give unpredictable results (usually the case when pictures are blurry, or too dark/bright), but I blame that on the auto mode computer, and partially the user, not the overall camera.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "A Well Rounded, Compact Camera that's Suitable for Beginners and Amateur Photographers", "Author": "Terrance S.", "ReviewID": "RJW43KSP8WJOM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot A720IS is an interesting beast as it doesn't seem to have particularly good or bad qualities. It takes pleasant pictures with good clarity and color, and the rich feature-set will satisfy both novice and experienced photographers, but in the end, this camera feels uninspired and amorphous. It's not as small or sleek as Canon's Digital ELPH series (SD Series), nor does it have the imaging abilities of the G series or the absolute zoom capabilities of the S series. If you could take all of Canon's consumer digital cameras (minus the DSLR's) and roll them up into a single camera, it would be very similar to the A720. This camera isn't anything exceptional, but it is very functional.With that said, this is one of the better budget cameras I've used. With various scene modes and full manual controls, it can grow with you as your skills improve, assuming you spend the time to learn how to use it. This camera works as an acceptable point-and-shoot in the program mode, but when you start playing with the manual controls, great low light and macro shots become possible. Some noteworthy elements of this camera are its excellent video mode (30fps 640x480 resolution), 6x optical zoom, and use of standard AA batteries. The flash is also pretty good and in the right mode, the camera will automatically adjust the flash's brightness.Digital Noise has been getting better throughout the years and with the new A720, you can pretty much use up to ISO200 without having to worry about noise. Although the camera supports higher ISO settings, anything above 200 will start to become very noticeably grainy. At ISO80, the pictures are just beautifully smooth.This camera performs exceptionally well outdoors on a sunny day, or in places where there are generous amounts of bright light - the picture quality in these situations can rival cameras costing twice as much! Unfortunately, this performance noticeably diminishes in challenging lighting situations such as those encountered on a hike in the woods. There, the overall level of light is lower but there are now very high contrast zones (such as sunlight peeking through the tree branches). Under these circumstances, the picture's colors become muted and flat with a tinge of blue. Also, under challenging lighting conditions, it's very easy to get blurry or over/underexposed shots. (You can fix the color issue by adjusting the camera's \"White Balance\", and you can help the over/underexposed shots by adjusting the \"Metering Mode\")In my opinion, the built-in image stabilization works, but it isn't terribly effective. IS cameras can't perform miracles - they can only compensate a little bit for camera shake, so blurry pictures will remain a reality. Observing the proper shooting posture and holding your breath is much more effective - many digital camera users extend both arms to hold the camera, which is an inherently unstable position. It's much more stable to hold the camera up to your face and use the viewfinder! There are a number of things you can do to fight blur besides relying on image stabilization, including: zooming out, using a higher ISO, increasing shutter speed, and opening up the aperture (make the F number smaller). Keep in mind that to effectively use this camera's 6x zoom, you'll either need a tripod or some other stable surface to put the camera on.The camera feels lightweight but sturdy, and is small enough to fit inside a large pocket. Although it is bulkier than the Digital ELPH series, with the A720, I can grip it firmly with both hands for steadier shooting.I didn't have too many complaints about this camera except that it's sluggish at times (especially when the flash is turned on), but power-on to first shot times are respectable. Another problem is that the built-in viewfinder is off-center and only shows about 70% of the scene, making fine compositions a very challenging task. In the end, this is a great camera and you get a lot for the money.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best digital camera model in its class", "Author": "Rahul Jain", "ReviewID": "R219NLZIGZMGTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had canon a75 which served well for almost 3 years before retiring.I knew canon digital cameras are best but I still did lot of research.Things do tend to change a lot in this field, and next generation best cameras can come from any company. I looked at Nikon, Sony, Olympus, Panasonic among the main contenders. Among Nikon L11 and L12, and similar models in others. This camera beats all others including its own cousins, the canon a570is and a710is.Between a570is and a710is, it is a tough choice because while a570is has a DIGIC III, it has 4x zoom while a710is has DIGIC II but 6x zoom. This camera combines the best of a570is and a710is: 8MP, DIGIC III, 6x zoom, Image Stabilization, ISO 1600, and oh, face detection! What it does lose over a710is is the special scene modes: color accent and color swap. I just do not understand why - while retaining hundreds of other features, canon had to remove those features in the a720is. Otherwise, anything that you can find in either of its cousins, you can find the better of the two in the a720is. And boy, it is fast to be ready for the shot!Of course, the a570is is much cheaper, as are most cameras in this class from competing brands.

Sharp", "ReviewID": "R2W4VPI9OTNATW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The A720 IS for the most part is a good camera but the Kids & Pets (action) and Landscape programs are defective. The action program in bright sunlight programmed 80 ISO and gave 1/100 and f 5.6. The landscape program gave ISO 80 and gave 1/250 at f 4.0. I have an A75 and a Rebel Xt both give high shutter speeds for action and smaller apertures for landscape. I checked with my dealer and he checked his other cameras with DIGIC III and they all did the same thing. I have called Canon and the techs try to be helpful but are clueless to the problem. The dealer has called Canon several times with nothing but a run around. The sales rep visited and he was not aware of the problem. If they come up with a properly programmed processor I'll send it in for repair.Since writing this my dealer after many calls got an engineer at Canon. He stated that the \"Kids and Pets\" program was not intended as an action program but was designed to reduce delay time so to capture pictures faster. The camera does not have an action program. He was unable to explain the large aperture on the Landscape program. So the processor is not defective but in my and my dealer's opinion poorly designed in these areas. For a work around I use Program with HI ISO. This gives a fairly good action program. For landscape I use AV with AUTO ISO and f 8.0. This camera was to replace an older Canon Power Shot A75.

One caveat:  Whatever you buy, be sure that you get a rangefinder window, however big the LCD.  Why?

While I liked the look and feel of the SX100 the sample photos on dpreview and flickr were not impressive and neither were the reviews. As for the flash delay for my camera it was only 2-3 seconds. People who say it takes 10 seconds are exaggerating unless they have really low batteries. The photos I have taken so far are awesome!

I've used many different cameras, especially in the prosumer range. I got an A710IS several months ago as my small, light, take-everywhere-everyday, pocket-or-pack camera. It's an excellent camera for my needs, easier to hold steady than a Canon SD-series (I've used my daughter's SD-630), and the Image Stabilization is wonderful in low light (I can handhold 1/10 sec shutter speed), and 6x zoom is convenient.Recently I was shopping for a not-too-expensive digicam for college-going son, and decided I'd \"upgrade\" to a A720IS, and give him my A710IS. For awhile I had both cameras here. There is a reason the msrp on the 720 is less $$ and it weighs 1/2 oz less -- the 720 is made in China and feels more plastic and less solid. The 710 is made in Japan, has a more sturdy body, better fit and finish. In fact, my 720 grip panel wiggled a little and squeaked until I added a tiny tad of Gorilla Glue in a strategic spot.Performance is very good, essentially the same for both cameras. Easy to use, takes fantastic photos, in-camera menus easy to use (I like Canon software logic). Flash recycle time may be a tad faster on the 720, but still pretty slow. Goes for 400-700 shots on a pair of AA batteries. (Use Lithiums or, better yet, rechargeable NiMH Hybrids. They rock!) I highly recommend this camera, either the more-solid 710 or the less-expensive 720. Size and performance are essentially the same. 7.1mp vs 8mp...no big deal. Digix II vs III...no big deal (II might even be better, and there are hacks available to allow you to shoot RAW and add other features) Get a 2GB or 4GB SD card, a small case for the camera, and take it everywhere with you so you'll never miss another \"kod*k\" moment.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Ernest Anderson Jr.", "ReviewID": "R8QDUGYRSM9HJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is the best camera I have ever owned.

I no longer work as a photographer, but still like taking pictures. Especially on holiday or when flying my paraglider. About 4 years ago I bought my first digital camera. It was the Canon A70. I bought it because it did everything including most importantly shooting in manual mode and being able to have good control over the flash output. I also liked the shape of the camera as it had a good grip making it easy to shoot one handed. That was especially important to me when taking photos while flying.Over the last couple years I was starting to think that I wanted a more far reaching lens and higher resolution. I didn't want to go over 10mp though as cameras of that or higher resolution caused colour fringeing. I looked at many cameras. But none except the Canon had all my requirements. I thought 8mp was perfect. Also the 6x optical zoom was exactly what I wanted along with full manual control. Also the movie mode is great. In essence I wanted a camera just like the A70 but better!Having used the A70, the A720 was very easy to get to grips with. And with the auto mode anyone could start shooting pretty quickly. With a little time spent with the camera and reading the manual you will soon be using the camera intuitively.I think the lens is very good and that's the most important part of any camera. But I find most of the shots will benefit from a very minor tweek in PhotoShop curves. This will allow a greater degree of contrast and colour saturation. I also like to sharpen them up just slightly with the unsharp mask. I try to set the camera up to do as little of the latter as possible as I like to have that control.The movie mode is really fun. When I go out shooting I like to take a combination of stills and clips. Then instead of making prints to put in a box under the bed; I like to make little movies of say my flying holiday in the Alps by combining the stills and clips, adding music, fades and titles all done in imovie on my Mac. I then burn them to CD and mail them to family and friends. Much more impressive than a few prints I think. The fact that the A720 can shoot at 30fps over the 15fps of the A70 is a great bonus. I can see I'll need to get a DVD burner soon.The other nice thing about this camera over the A70 is that it is a little lighter due mostly to the fact that it requires 2 batteries instead of four. I'd recommend the 2gb SD memory cards. I bought two of them. I think this will allow two weeks of holiday shooting stills and clips. For the A70 I had two 256mb cards and I generally used one per week. The A720's higher resolution I think will require the 2gb cards.Hats off to Canon for supplying a very picky shopper with a small, light and highly specced digital camera.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "A very good camera", "Author": "THE GAMER", "ReviewID": "R35POFKDOG2263", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera couple days ago because of the reviews it has on other site, and i can tell you they were'nt lieing.

I am a very poor photographer with a good appreciation of photography, which is a painful situation to be in.  In the past I have used a 3 mega-pixel camera phone, a Kodak camera in about the same price range, and then some Sony digital mini-cameras.  I use this camera mainly indoors in medium light (energy-saving bulbs, late afternoon, overcast or raining).  My approach is to take pictures early and often and hope for the best.  I was looking for a camera that had great potential and that even I (read: one of the worst picture-takers you'll ever meet) could get some decent pictures with.  I have never taken a photography course and never will, because if I have the time and money I will spend it on something I can hope to actually get good at.  I think I am a pretty typical camera-buyer.About the camera:  This camera met all of my expectations.  It is very easy to use and delivers great quality photos in a variety of situations with an absolute minimum of skill and zero talent, which is what I wanted from a point-and-shoot.When the other reviewers say it doesn't work well in low-light, they mean, very low light, like this is not a camera for amateurs that want to do some good photography at night or in a room with only a 20-watt bulb.  The flash works fine for the rest of us!  I certainly have not had any light issues and we do not live in the brightest of houses or climates.  I used the night mode for quiet times and the auto-with-flash for active night pictures and they turned out fine.This camera is nice because it has two functions that help poor photographers in particular (in addition to other modes that probably help everyone equally): the kids and pets function, which allows you to take picture after picture in quick succession so you don't miss any action, and the auto function which provides a higher-quality picture.  If I use these according to the recommendations in the user's manual, I can usually get 25 - 50% of my pictures of a moderate to good quality, as compared to an (imaginary) amateur photographer who actually knows what she is doing.  That is compared to 1 - 5% of pictures using a camera phone or another cheap camera without these easy-to-use modes.This camera is not so small that I lose it in my purse, which is a danger with tiny cameras, if your purse is anything like mine.The stabilizer is also great since I take pictures while running after my toddler.  I had considered buying the very cute Nikon in the same price range (the one that looks like a Brownie camera), but they did not have stabilizers, so I finally went for this one and I am very glad.  The function works great.One thing that they don't mention in the descriptions is that you do not have to switch between the viewfinder and the LCD display, like on some cameras.  What I mean is that you can look through the little window like on regular cameras, OR at the big screen, like on digital cameras, all the time, without switching view mode.  So you can switch from person to person without having to switch the view mode.  This is great because my mother likes the viewfinder and I like the LCD.  I also like to switch between them.Another nice thing that I like is the ease with which you can switch from taking pictures to review mode to look at the pictures you took.  It is a separate switch that you could find in the dark if you needed to.  That is nice because I have deleted many a batch of photos trying to figure out how to get into the mode where I can review the pictures I have just taken.The pictures I have taken with this camera are located at [...] (this is an ad-free, non-commercial set of our family pictures).  You can see which ones were taken with the Canon A720IS by clicking on the photo and looking in the right-hand column, and compare them with other pictures I have taken.  As I have mentioned I have no skills or talent in this area so if you are someone who really wants decent pictures but are also a photo dunce who just wants a picture of your kid or grandkid, this would give you a good idea of what to expect.(If you are an amateur or pro photographer, this review and those samples are not for you because you could probably do better with a camera obscura.)I would certainly buy this camera again.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good camera for those who want manual control", "Author": "A.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to find a moderately priced small digital camera with manual control.  Most new cameras do not allow completely independent control of aperture, focus, exposure time etc.  This camera allows you to adjust settings independently as well as operate on full automatic control.  It also has a longer exposure time up to 15 seconds than most of the competitors.  It has steady shot and face recognition. Picture quality seems good, a little better than my other digital cameras.  The one complaint is that recovery time seems slow, several seconds, so it would be easy to miss action shots.  Honestly though, since the camera is new to me I have not fully explored how various settings influence the recovery time.

CHARLOT", "ReviewID": "R1W6GWYR0J73PM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon \"A\" series have always been rather unique. They are cameras that are economically priced, yet offer capabilities and features that you usually only see on more expensive cameras. Unfortunately, it looks like the A-720is might be the last of the Canon \"A\" models with full manual control; the newer A-1000 and A-2000 have only Program AE and Auto (plus some scene modes).  The A-720is has three exposure modes that the A-1000 and A-2000 don't offer: Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and full Manual, plus the A-720 has Manual Focus control, which has been dropped on the newer \"A\" series models.  Some people might ask, are these manual modes necessary in a compact?  I say \"yes\", because every so often, anyone can get into a photographic situation where you won't be able to \"get the shot\" with the full-automatic modes.  These situations usually involve low-light or poor contrast conditions, for example shooting landscapes at dusk or dawn, or on foggy days. Cameras like the Canon \"A\" series use \"contrast detection\" to decide when focus is properly set, and if the scene doesn't have much contrast, the camera's auto-focus will \"hunt\" excessively and may be unable to find the proper focus at all.  When this happens, you can set the camera to manual focus and get the shot, assuming your camera has this capability.  As for manual exposure modes, you need Aperture Priority to set specific depth-of-field.  For example, in shots where the foreground subject is 4 feet away, and the background is at infinity, you want to use the smallest aperture possible (f8 on most Canon \"A\" models), so that everything in the frame will be sharply focused. In situations where your subject is in motion, you will often want to control shutter speed - fast for sports and action shots, or perhaps a deliberately slow shutter speed to capture the look of flowing water with motion blur.  The Canon A-720is lets you handle any of these situations; the new A-1000 and A-2000 have only some scene modes with no actual manual control.What's good about the A-720is:1. Very good value at it's price point. I paid $190 for mine.  For this price you get an 8 megapixel sensor, 6x zoom lens, optical image stabilization, full manual controls, 2.5\" LCD screen (115,000 pixels), and an optical viewfinder. This last is handy for when your batteries are getting low - you can turn off the LCD and still take pictures with the viewfinder.2. Excellent image quality. Images are sharp, exposure is generally pretty accurate, and color saturation very nice.  Of course this isn't a digital SLR, so don't expect miracles, but for a camera small enough to stick in a shirt pocket, the photos are remarkably good.3. Optical Image Stabilization.  Most cameras have this now, so it's not really remarkable.4. Uses \"AA\" batteries instead of a lithium pack.  This is actually the defining feature of the Canon \"A\" series - they all are \"AA\" battery powered. I prefer this as you can get \"AA\"'s anywhere.  Unfortunately, the A-700 series began the current Canon trend of downsizing from four batteries (in the A-600 cameras), to only two.  This has caused a noticeable increase in flash recharge time, plus of course the A-720is itself needs battery changes more often than it would if it used four batteries.  However, I don't mean to imply that the A-720is is \"slow\".  It's power-up speed, shutter-lag time, and time to first shot are all pretty good, and are at least equal to the average for other cameras of this class and price point.5. Very simple, yet powerful, control layout and menus.  This camera has only a few buttons on it, and the menu is as simple and user friendly as it could be.  This camera would not intimidate an older person unfamiliar with modern electronic gadgets.  Even with it's paucity of buttons, it still manages to have full manual controls.  A really nice feature is the ability to program the direct print button to another function, most useful is probably to change ISO speed.6. 640 x 480 x 30 frames-per-second video.  This is pretty much standard on cameras in this class, so not really a special feature.  Like all compact still cameras, the quality of the sound captured during video shooting is horrible - if you want good sound, get a real video camera - but the video image quality is pretty good.  Video is stored in the standard MJPEG format.7. Uses standard, cheap, easy to find SD and SDHC memory cards. You can put an 8 gig SDHC card in this camera for about $20 and it will capture 2888 stills at max image size and best quality, or about 70 minutes of video clips.What's bad about the A-720is:  There's not much to dislike here.  There are a few features that it doesn't have:1. No flash mounting shoe, although this is such a small camera that sticking a flash gun on top of it would make it so top-heavy it would be hard to control.2. No RAW capture capability. This has always been one feature that Canon uses to separates the \"A\" series from the more expensive \"G\" series.  I guess if you are a serious photographer, shooting subjects that would benefit from using RAW format, you're probably going to use a digital SLR rather than a sub-$200 compact.3. Occasional exposure and auto-focusing errors. However, this A-720is seems to perform rather better than my old A-620 did, making fewer mistakes. Again, you shouldn't expect DSLR performance from a $200 compact, but that said, I'd guess that at least 95% of all shots that you might take in average lighting conditions, will be error-free.  In poor lighting, if the camera can't manage in full Auto pr Program mode, go to manual control and you can probably get a useable shot.4. Unrealistic ISO speeds. I have never yet seen a $200 digital camera that can get nice looking photos at ISO speeds above 200, maybe 400 in a pinch. The A-720is offers ISO 800 and even ISO 1600. At these settings, the CCD gain has been boosted so much that electronic noise in the image gets really noticeable.  The only time I would use these speeds is in a really dark indoor shooting situation where you can't get close enough to the subject for the camera's flash to light it sufficiently.  For example at a birthday party where you have only this one opportunity to \"get the shot\" of your kid blowing out the candles on the cake, using high ISO speeds will get you that once-in-a-lifetime shot, but don't expect to be able to make larger than a 4\" x 6\" print.  High ISO shots from these compact cameras will probably be too \"noisy\" to make decent 8 x 10 enlargements. If you often need to shoot subjects like this, get a DSLR with a CMOS sensor - some of those cameras can shoot at ISO 1600 with no more noise than at ISO 100.5. The tripod socket is plastic, and is placed way over on the outside edge of the camera's bottom plate - about the worst placement of a tripod socket I've ever seen, but the camera is so small and light that this shouldn't be too much of a problem in most tripod situations.  If you needed to orient the camera on a tripod looking vertically downward, the offset tripod socket could potentially be a real problem. In that case, I'd probably try to secure the side of the camera opposite to the tripod socket to the tripod plate with a large rubber band, rather than clamping down really tight on those plastic threads.  A big rubber band would be somewhat inelegant, but better that than risk dropping the camera or stripping the tripod socket threads by tightening down too much.In my opinion, there are two primary reasons to buy a Canon \"A\" or \"SD\" series camera:1) You absolutely have to have a shirt-pocket size camera and nothing larger will do.  And you want a camera that has reasonably good image quality at an economy price.2) You are buying an \"expendable\" camera that can be used in an waterproof housing for scuba diving or snorkeling. The Canon \"WP-DC\" underwater housings are economically priced, and you can generally get maybe 100 dives out of one before the o-rings are shot and the housing fails.  Any underwater photographer will tell you that NO camera housing is 100% fail-safe.  All scuba divers that carry cameras will sooner or later suffer a housing failure, which of course is the end of that camera.  The Canon \"A\" and \"SD\" cameras with a \"WP-DC\" housing offer scuba photography up to 130' depth for as little as $350, compared to the thousands of dollars you would risk on a DSLR camera body and lens in an underwater housing.  And the image quality from these little cameras is amazing, especially if you use an underwater flash gun like the SeaLife SL-960D.If your photographic needs don't fall into either of the two categories stated above, but you are not quite ready to step up to a full DSLR,  I'd suggest you look at one of the newer generation of Ultra-Zoom \"performance compact\" cameras from Canon, Sony, Panasonic, Nikon, and Olympus. Canon's version is the SX10is. Panasonic's is the DMC-FZ28, a camera that is being very highly rated for performance and value, and that has WAY more capability than any compact like the A-720is, for only about $50 more.CONCLUSION: If you can still find a new one, I'd recommend this camera over an A-2000 or any of the Canon \"SD\" models (none of the SD's have manual controls, and all of them use proprietary  lithium batteries). If you can't find a new A-720is at a reasonable price ($200 or less), and you can live without manual controls, the A-2000is would be my second choice. It's primary image sensor has two-megapixels more resolution than the A-720is (10 vs 8), and a much better LCD screen with double the resolution. The A-2000 has the same 6x lens and is nearly identical in size and weight to the A-720is, and probably has about equal image quality. NOTE: Canon does not currently offer a WP-DC underwater housing for either the A-1000 or A-2000, but they might in the near future. Canon's web page for underwater housings is at: [...]I give the A-720is a \"highly recommended\" rating for quality and value.

It has only two AA batteries, so you can expect long delays after using the flash. And nearly all the preset modes have a slow shutter speed, so pictures with motion will quite likely be blurry. Manual configuration is an option, but unfortunately you can't make the shutter speed faster without taking full manual control. I also saw a HUGE amount of blurring in many of the still pictures I took, and I'm not sure if it was something endemic to this camera (e.g., IS kicking in unnecessarily and blurring things rather than smoothing them) or simple \"lemon\" factor in my camera, so be aware that the latter might or might not still be an issue, even if you can live with the first two items.--------[the long version]I was so excited to get this camera with image stabilization and face recognition, because old camera would occasionally take blurry action shots, and I didn't like the recharge speed. Unfortunately, this camera simply doesn't cut it on either point, despite the rave reviews I've seen on every site and in Consumer Reports. I'm told this is because I commit the cardinal sin of using the flash regularly plus an occasional zoom.This camera is actually worse than my 6-year-old Canon subcompact for speed. After pressing the shutter down, I wait a full second or more... enough so that I'm tempted to press the shutter and THEN say \"one, two, three.\" And then I have to wait at least 6-8 seconds (unfortunately I'm not exaggerating; persists even with different batteries, different memory cards, and different quality settings) before I can take another shot--long enough for the cute moments to be long-since finished, so there's no way I can get a second shot of the same cute moment :(The inability to take a \"second chance\" picture is an even bigger problem because about one out of 3 pictures is crazy-blurry... enough so that you can't recognize my daughter even though she's just 5-8 feet away and the only person in the picture (e.g,. taking a picture of her Halloween costume, indoors with good light coming through the window). Even a close-up of my daughter and infant son together shows her beaming at him, and his eyes streaking across a four-inch span. Granted, he -did- move, but he's only 4 months, and that's sort of expected! Apparently this is because nearly all the various mode options (including \"kids and pets\"--there is no \"sports\" mode) have a slow shutter speed. (And yes, you can configure a faster shutter speed, but only if you're willing to take full manual control, which I don't have the time to do while playing with kids.) For those pictures with no movement that were insanely blurry, I wonder if the IS was kicking in when it didn't need to (possibly combined with the bugaboo of slow shutter speed). Who knows--either way, my other cameras take great, non-blurry shots, and this one doesn't. In fairness, the the camera -did- tell me to use a tripod... but that icon never turned off, period. And as a mom of a 3-year old and a 4-month old, it's ludicrous to think I'd be carting a tripod around with me just to take pictures of my kids! Incidentally, when I tested the same model in a store, the same thing happened--the icon never turned off.Another quirk I noticed while trying to get good pictures is that the facial recognition is, well, silly. In one picture of my daughter, it zoomed in on her neck rather than her face. In another picture of my son in a bouncy seat (which is a solid off-white), it focused over one shoulder, so as I pressed the shutter down halfway to get it to pick a new focus, it selected a spot over the other shoulder, then on his belly, and then cycled through the same choices again. Another shot of my daughter focused on the tile behind her (pale gray with white grout), and another selected the (solid, off-white) wall rather than her face. Ummm... and my children are quite photogenic with typical features, so it's not a case of them being Picasso-esque so as to confuse the camera! (Incidentally, I've since noticed other reviews of Canon cameras saying things like \"about half the pictures I took at Thanksgiving were blurry,\" which I had previously discounted.) I partly wonder if it's a software issue, since the camera would fade into and out of focus, until settling on unfocused... but then presumably other people would have noticed the same problem as well, so who knows...Despite all of the above, convinced that the problem was me, I tried several things:* different memory cards (including high-speed ones)* different megapixel settings* different ISO settings* different mode settings (everything except \"fireworks\" and \"snow scene\"! ... as mentioned, there is no \"sports\" mode, and \"kids and pets\" astoundingly has a slow shutter speed... as do most of the other modes)* different batteries (including lithium and NiMH rechargables)* turning the IS off temporarily* turning the facial recognition off temporarily* using the viewfinder (my preference) versus LCD screen (since it gives you more information)* taking pictures of things other than my children (the camera DID take beautiful pictures of my dresser and the shampoo bottles in the bathroom)* testing another 720IS at a local store, where maybe 1 in 8 pictures was blurry (not as bad as my own camera, but at that point, ANY blurring in a shot was going to make me huffy)* mixing and matching most of the above (admittedly less so on the camera in the store than my own)A reply to my review recommends taking a photography course, but I have a master's and husband has a PhD, and if all of the above don't cut it--let alone the whole idea of \"point and shoot\"!--this camera is REALLY not for beginners or busy parents trying to capture those cute, fleeting moments.So the manual and other reviews I read do make the camera seem pretty cool, plus you can configure things a million ways and sideways... but that aside, I need a point and shoot that will quickly take pictures in focus, and this simply didn't do it.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good camera--until cheap design & manufacturing killed it.", "Author": "J. Meadors \"J Meadors\"", "ReviewID": "R2SFZP8Z9N4C88", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I must say that up until the poor design and cheap manufacturing techniques rendered the camera virtually useless, I rather enjoyed the A720is.  Sadly, in their quest to make everything .01 cheaper, almost all manufacturers are building products with a very short life cycle.  (In this case, just over a year.)This particular camera has uses AA batteries and there is a little trap door on the bottom of the camera that opens up to reveal the batteries & the memory card.  So, this little door gets a lot of use if you use the camera on a regular basis--either when changing the batteries or when removing the memory card to get the pics off.  Unfortunately, the entire functionality of this door relies on a tiny piece of plastic on the body of the camera that the door latches to.  Obviously you and I and Canon all know that anything made of plastic is going to break--probably sooner rather than later.  And, the way this tiny little flap of plastic is integrated into the body of the camera--it's virtually irreplaceable.  So, on that tiny little 2 cent piece of plastic, Canon hung the entire functionality of this device.  That was either very stupid or very calculated.  I tend to think the latter.So, all of a sudden one day the door won't latch back tightly enough to hold the batteries in place--which means no power to the camera.  I mean, you can kind of take pics if you use a couple of fingers to squeeze the battery door shut--but it's clumsy and if you release the pressure even for a moment the power supply is interrupted and the camera dies.In electronics life cycles, 14 or 16 or 18 months may seem like a long time--but I have 35mm cameras that cost a fraction of what this camera cost me--that are 15, 20, 25 yrs old--and still work fine.  In fact, they take better images than just about any point & shoot digital.  And they have little trap doors for the film and/or the batteries as well... but somehow they seemed to be willing to make those devices more durable--possibly because the technology didn't really change much over the years.  (film, light, shutter--image... so simple a caveman could work it)Not being one to reward poor design and cheap manufacturing, I will not buy another Canon.  I have already bought a replacement camera--a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ8 with Leica optics & a wider angle lense.  To be honest, the image quality doesn't seem to be quite as good as the Canon--particularly in low light (which is why I bought that particular Canon model).  But it cost $110 instead of $200 so if it craps out in 14, 16, 18 month--I guess I just buy a new one.In the past I've had to replace several digital cameras--usually for electronics malfunctioning--which, for some reason, I can accept more readily than just cheap, pettiness on the part of the manufacturer.  I'm all for smaller & lighter but not at the expense of basic quality & intelligent, considerate design & manufacturing.  One by one every corporation seems to be changing their paradigm to view the end users not as \"customers\" but as \"cash flow potential\".

And it is not minor.  Evidently the processor has to write directly to the card.  I spent yesterday afternoon putting the camera through its paces and I was quite taken aback by this problem.  I was repeatedly frustrated as I tried to take a series of shots quickly.  The zoom is also frozen each time until the write is completed.  Anyone used to a modern DSLR is in for a big surprise.  My experience was duplicated by a friend with his 720.  A fast card is very desirable, but it won't solve the problem (I used one).

Love the special effects, the sepia mode makes some great looking photos with that old time look. The Movie Mode works real well, though the sound is a bit muddy, but this is not a video camera after all. The viewing LCD is bright and larger that my other digicams screens. The controls are well placed and intuitive (for me, anyway). It is far lighter than my 8 year old 1.3mp Olympus, and takes pictures much faster. The 6X optical zoom is a great improvement over the usual 3-4X zoom found on most digital cameras in this price range.I am very happy so far with my purchase.  The Cons:1-  Short battery life! Take along extras! It is nice that it takes easily available AA batteries, though.2-  It seems to have a fairly long flash recharge time. I have found myself shooting back-to-back shots and often the flash is not ready, yet. Not a big problem, but I have to remind my self to be more patient between shots, at least for a few extra seconds.3- Memory card that ships with the camera (16 megs) is WAY too small for an 8 mega pixel camera, maybe 8-10 shots.

I've compared it to my friends' cameras of same category, and the pictures are really better (compared to a sony w-55 and a hp r937).When in auto mode the daylight pictures are nice, but if you don't have a strong sun, I recommend you to adjust manually the white balance in order to avoid blueish tones.The wide variety of ISO modes (ranging from 80 to 1600) is almost useless, as above ISO400 the noise becomes unacceptable. Instead of this, I recommend the aperture/shutter time priority modes in order to get a good picture with low light conditions. Of course the results will be quite different from the dSLRs, but the pictures remain pretty good for a point-and-shoot.The wide selection of drive modes (multiple shots, 1~10, 15, 20 or 30 seconds of delay combined with 1~10 shots) and the white balance pre-defined options are nice features.The face detection works very well too, and the stitch assist is a plus (but you'll need to merge pictures on a computer, using software supplied... hp r937 and kodak fz812 do this automatically on the camera.. I think this is not a big problem, as probably you will take just some panoramic pictures).The zoom controls are great, and the 6x lenses are sufficient to regular pictures where you want to highlight main subjects. The movie mode is good (but if this is very important to you, consider looking canon S5 with stereo sound)..The battery life is awesome... if you buy 4 AA rechargeable so you'll have no problems with this...

The following are my observations and comments:1. The package arrived within a week under the superSaver ground delivery, but it show no sign of manufacturer's seal. The box can be open easily without openning the typical plastic wraps or breaking the manufacturer seals. Just wonder how Amazon guarantees, this camera I received is a brand new camera, or just a returned one.2. The noise levels of the camera is just visibly high for indoor shots even at low ISO setting. I tried different setting on JPEG, fine, very fine, and different sizes. The noise remains visible regardless of ISO settings,  even visible for outdoor shots in the dark/shaddy areas under low ISO settings.3. The auto-focus is not very accurate. Thus, at 8MP the clarity and sharpness is just about the same as my 4MP G3. Since Image Stabilization is turned on, I'd wouldn't blame the clarity/sharpness reduction to unsteady hands.4. There is a long delay of storing the image after each shot 3-4 seconds, if flash is used, the delay is even longer, even using the high speed SD cards, 133X. This delay is much longer than my G3.5. The battery came with the package last only for about 40 shots and two 15 seconds video clips and then started giving me low battery warning.6. The Canon software came with the camera is compatable to G3 but it is somewhat awkward and requires a very different download process from that of Canon G3. Definitley, one will have to learn to adapt to the new process.I'd say, this camera is only good enough for very casual photography, especially, if your main viewing is printed formats which are less than or equal to 8X11.

McNulty", "ReviewID": "R2FI9KSSZHKBTS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was researching online today for a camera to give my daughter for her birthday.  As I researched, I found reports ('Best' Lists, consumer report type things) which all had contrary information making the decision practically impossible.  I decided to look at the reviews for my personal camera, to establish how others reviewed a camera I considered the worst camera I have ever owned.  I was horrified when I saw the reviews, and sick when I saw the high price.  I figured for sure I had a different camera (I got mine new for significantly ($500) cheaper elsewhere) and so I studied the pictures, even zooming in, to make sure that yes I had the camera and yes it was rated well and selling for over 600.I have read the other low ratings, so I know what I am in for with this poor rating, but I will not be deterred.  When I buy a product, I always look at the lowest rated ones to see the potential problems.  Granted, people should not give a low rating for shipping issues, or the time it takes the company to send it, but they should if they would have made a different purchase decision if they had had the information previously.  I give a 1 to something I would never purchase again, and would tell anyone considering it to STOP!!  and DON'T DO IT!!So, with that in mind, here goes:It eats batteries.  All types of batteries.  Every battery.  I've tried everything.  If you plan on taking your camera on vacation take several boxes of batteries... NIMH whatever... it burns through them faster than any camera I have ever owned.  Absolutely infuriating.It is soooooooooooooo slooooooooooooowwwwwww  to take a picture.  To get a picture of the child blowing out the candles of a birthday cake you need to take the picture while they are INHALING!!!  Pi\u00f1ata picture?  Press the button during the kid's windup (I've actually gotten some pretty cool pictures using this method with candy flying all over).So, you might think those aren't good enough reasons to give a camera a poor review, you may question my competence, and demand I take a camera class prior to ever reviewing a camera again (or better yet, save everyone's time and destroy my keyboard) but what people don't understand is that with kids, you've got to move fast.  You can't be saying \"wait, I need more batteries\" when they are racing for the tree X-mas morning.  It doesn't matter how great the picture quality of the birthday photo is if the picture does not capture the surprised look on their face, but instead captures the wrapping paper being tossed away.So, with that in mind, and with the overwhelming majority suggesting that I am completely out of my mind, go ahead and decide on your own.

It really did perform as advertised with the exception of the battery life. Maybe I got a lemon, but the little red battery indicator kept coming on way sooner than it should have. Yes, I understand from other reviewers that the little red light is not necessarily an indication that the batteries need to be changed right away, rather it means they may need to be changed soon. It didn't matter in my case, not long after the red light came on, the entire camera would poop out. Totally unacceptable for me. I would say I could take maybe 60 pictures and then the batteries would give out. I tried turn off IS and moving it to 5mp, I tried energy saving mode, I tried turning off the preview screen after only 20 seconds, believe me, I tried!Pictures were quite sharp, the zoom worked very well. Colors looked good and accurate. Dynamic range isn't all that great as low light photos showed mostly dark and light areas with very few shades in between, but it's a point and shoot so I'll go easy on it here. My D40 creams this camera in this category, but I paid a lot more for that.The camera is small enough, I was able to keep it in my jacket pocket and tote it around with no problems. I love the ability to stitch together panoramas, too bad I didn't get a chance to play with that feature. I also love the clarity of the videos that I made with this camera. Very clear, almost better than my camcorder! I never did find the feature that allows time delayed video creation but then again I didn't have this camera for long.I won't be recommending this camera to anyone, but I won't give up on Canon since I know they have quality cameras. Maybe I'll give the A570IS a try.Btw - if you use the \"P\" setting (Programmed Auto Exposure) and you move the setting of the flash down (making it a little less powerful) you can get the flash to fire every 3 seconds or so, maybe more if you set it lower. So you can get those shots of your little kids. There's also a continuous mode shooting which will allow the camera to continually take pictures as long as you hold the button down.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great images, so so ergonomics, outdated menu system", "Author": "MysticJaguar", "ReviewID": "R2K6BI8B2KOXVV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned various models of the A-series starting with the A520 in 2005.  The A720 is the best one I've owned thanks to a trusted design, great image processing, and the 6x zoom lens.  After a recent trip with my Nikon D60 and A720is I started looking for a bridge camera (aka superzoom) to lighten my load (mostly to leave the D60 at home next time).  In my testing I have viewed hundreds of samples online from Digital Elph and Panasonic minis to all the major superzooms.  I have also tested in hand the Fuji s1000fd which faired very poorly in image quality next to the A720is.  I also have tested in hand a Panasonic FX-37 and the image quality of the A720is is superior.  So beyond the slow flash recycle time of the A720is I am very pleased with this camera.  But my searching has led me to realize that a successor to the A720is is not to be found within the Canon stable.You see Canon has largely crippled the latest in the A series (after the 720 and 590) by removing control, manual and otherwise, from the line.  Gone is Aperature and Shutter Priority let alone full manual adjustment.  The newer S/SX series is taking over this space.  But one of the most important things I realized from having used this controllable A-series for these years is how important a compact body AND a viewfinder is.  On my recent vacation I was out in direct sun alot.  You cannot see LCDs of any digicam in full sun.  Having some kind of viewfinder is not an antiquated hack like a film advance lever, it is necessary.  The SX110 (evident immediate successor to the A-series control) has no viewfinder.  And the SX1 is has not lived up to the previous S models and has the weight and bulk from 4 AA batteries.  So the A720, unless replaced by another controllable 'A' appears to be the end of the line for this great series.Looping the A720 back into this discussion there is something that bothers me about it besides the flash recycle time.  And that is aspects of the design.  The small grip is pretty good.  Canon is having problems getting the 'grip' right on their low end digicams (Digital Rebels and SX1 being examples of inadquate grips) but the A720 grip is ok for A720 size.  The newer A series is blending the grip away which is a mistake.  But having an A720 for a year and a half the thing that is really starting to bug me in general about Canon is the lack of innovation most evident in the menu system.  The menu system on Canon camera at the low end is virtually identical and it lacks panache.  It looks like something you would give to children.  When you look at the menu system of Nikons you have something slightly better and the Panasonic menu systems like in the FX37 is much easier to navigate than Canon.So when I boil down why I am still using the A720is it is a combination of size and image quality.  Going smaller in any camera line I know of will not get you the image quality the A720is has to offer.  All cameras are compromises and the A720 hit a very usable sweet spot in design that I do not see Canon aiming at again.The overall impression I have is that Canon has lost their edge.  They still have the best overall image sensor quality, but the packaging in the camera body, and the menu system, have been very much hit and miss.  Nikon have edged them out of the low-end DSLR space, taken bites out of their higher end DSLRs, and Panasonic have bitten into their P&S; end.  Pentax having surprised with K10d and K20d, and micro 4:3 also looking like a potential player.  I don't see Canon doing anything revolutionary to get an edge and their groove back.  The SD1200is and siblings are cute minicams but they do not feel like a solid camera like FX37.  The A720 has few if any worthy siblings in the current low-end Canon line up.Oh, and for my bridge camera search, I really wanted to like the Fuji s1000fd/s1500fd. The size and outer ergonomics of that style are spot on.  But image quality is not good overall.  The Nikon P90 is too big and image quality flat.  The SX1 is too big.  In general I am most impressed with Panasonic as a camera line.  The FZ28 is a very nice camera but with the FZ models having an annual sales life I've decided to wait for the FZ38 or whatever the FZ28 successor is.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but it's picky about batteries.", "Author": "GeorgiaGeekGuy", "ReviewID": "R225R0FXZSLNA2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:1. Great images. Canon rarely disappoints. Highly rated by many professional camera reviewers.2. Good selection of menu options3. Good \"auto\" setting for the amateur.4. Good size, though not an ultra-thin pocket camera. I personally like the 'grip' that juts out a little, and it fits in a coat pocket fine.5. Best feature: old school optical viewfinder -and- LCD screen (LCD screens are fine, but they eat batteries, and are nearly useless in bright sunlight).6. Good OPTICAL zoom (and digital zoom can be turned off via the menu).7. Uses AA batteries (rechargeable highly recommended), so no need for a custom battery pack or unique charge cord/device). I despise expensive, propietary battery packs, so AA batteries in the A720IS is great.I got it for under $200, but this model has been replaced by newer models (which in my opinion are not that different), and the A720IS now usually costs more since it is getting rare.CON:1. Eats regular AA batteries like a hungry King Kong.2. Low battery indicator lights up long before batteries are depleted.3. Flash recycle time slow, but no worse than some similar models.IMPORTANT:It is highly recommended you use GOOD rechargeable batteries (supposedly Sony Eneloop or Rayovac Hybrid work best), or you will never get more than a few dozen shots. I find that turning off the LCD preview, red-eye reduction, and a few other options does extend battery life. I mainly use the optical viewfinder, then review my pics periodically on the LCD screen, rather than leaving it on all the time to drain the battery.If even rechargeable batteries don't last long in your A720IS, you may have received a flawed camera.

Good quality outdoor and indoor photos.The outdoor photos weren't quite as good as the Panasonic (when compared side by side), but you'd never know it if you were just looking at the Canon shots. They are very good and I am happy with them. The indoor shots are miles better than the Panasonic and really quite good too (but obviously not as good as the Nikon DSLR). I was impressed. The color balance and brightness quality is right on.2. I love the auto red eye correction feature. Very useful.3. I found that that Auto setting is just about right for all situations.

I wish it has a battery level indicator on the LCD.2. The MAIN PROBLEM (which is really very annoying actually): As everyone else mentions - the recharge time is almost unbearable. It is worse than my 7 year old Sony cybershot. After a weekend of taking photos (the batteries are on the low end) I have to wait a full 10 seconds before being able to take another photo. Count to 10 slowly - that is a long time!NOTES:1. I took 160 photos and 6 movies over the course of a 4 day vacation on the two batteries. They aren't dead yet, but I did get a battery low warning.2. A number of indoor shots were blurry though (like I took 6 pictures of the same two people in the same position, and 3 of them were blurry). Weird. Could be due to taking the photos when the batteries were low or the auto focus just focused on the wrong subject (I will have to experiment more with the various auto focus options).OVERALL:I wouldn't pay $250-$300 for this camera (which is why I didn't stick with the other Canon's I tested, the 870IS, 850, 750), but I would happily pay $170 for this camera (which I did).

I upgraded from an Olympus C2000 which I always thought took great photos.  The Canon A720 IS is about 1/3 its size and blows those photos away in detail and photo quality.  I also love the 6 x optical zoom.  The 6 x optical zoom, mini movie mode and ability to add lenses is why I purchased this model.  My Olympus C2000 was only 3 x optical and many cameras fool you with digital zoom which is lame.  The stock SD 16 mb card takes 4 photos in medium so make sure to order a large quantity(up to 4gb) fast SD card, fast in case you want to take a mini movie which I have not yet tried.  moderately priced, great photos . . .

I have used it camping, boating, biking, hiking, flying, and for all sorts of other outdoor activities where a larger camera would be impractical.  All controls accessible with one hand.The program mode allows me to permanently suppress the flash (I almost never use it) and the image stabilization allows slow shutter speeds in low light conditions.  The shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual modes give me all the flexibility I could want in setting exposures.The combination of 6X optical zoom, 8 megapixels, image stabilization, and AA batteries cannot be found in any other camera this small and light.  The optical viewfinder is great for bright conditions where the LCD screen is washed out.  The viewfinder crops the actual image - you should zoom in tighter than you normally would.The camera has a few flaws.  At the higher ISO settings (800 and 1600 but also a little at 400) the images start to go a bit grainy (but still usually yield good quality up to 8x10 enlargements).  The camera does not do well with regular alkaline battteries - the low battery indicator lights up early and the camera soon rejects the batteries even though they have plenty of power for other devices.  I think it has to do with the battery's voltage characteristic.  Rechargeable Lithium ion batteries, however, do very well in it.  Alkalines are good for backup if nothing else is available.  But these problems are small compared to the utility this camera provides in a small, inexpensive package.If you have someone else using the camera who is not comfortable with all the settings available, you can simply switch it to auto mode and let them point and shoot.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Short and Sweet!", "Author": "Karielk", "ReviewID": "RPD9NCENNV04G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a lot of extensive descriptive reviews about this camera.

Before I purchased, I did major research and my price cap was $200.  I narrowed down to the Sony DSC80 and this Canon.  I got both for comparison at a store with generous return policy (FYI Best Buy charges a fee for open box returns and Sony puts Sony tamper-proof tape on boxes).Aside from sales and special deals, Amazon did have the best price on most of the cameras I looked at.I wanted to like the Sony, it was smaller, very cute, and came in pink.  The Canon was boxy silver boring.  However when I took the comparison pictures (auto settings on both cameras), there was no comparison.  The image quality was sooo much better in the Canon, at least with my limited skills and HP computer/printer.It does seem slow between shots, but I don't remember how fast the Sony was.  The old HP camera is my only point of reference and this Canon is still way faster than that.  With my 5YO son, dog and cat, it seems that they are either still/posed and you have plenty of time for a second chance, or they are in motion and the fastest camera in the world won't get you a second chance.  Speed was not a top priority for me, I knew at my price range, some things would be compromised.I like having a viewfinder, but I don't trust myself with that yet.  Turning off the display might speed up shots?  I like that it uses a regular SD card and AA batteries have their advantages.  I was worried about the battery life because the old camera ate AA batteries--the main reason I was ditching it.  Thus far, battery life on the Canon has not been an issue at all, newer cameras must be better about this.Nice surprise #1:  I wasn't expecting to care about zoom, but I am glad now that I have the 6X optical.  I use it a lot more than I thought I would and it looks good.Nice surprise #2: Didn't expect to ever use the video setting, but it is very good for a few minutes of \"kid in a Christmas program\" footage.  The quality was a very pleasant surprise.Negative thing--I don't know if this would be different on any camera in this class.  Distant still shots of my son't class in a poorly lit gym with flash, zoom and red-eye reduction resulted in strange white cataract-looking spots on many but not all of the kids' eyes.  I will try turning off the Red eye reduction next time, maybe that did it.  Red eye is easy to get rid of with photo software, but these white spots are a pain. I opened the photos in a paint program and zoomed in to pixel-level to get rid of them (with no idea what I am doing--takes forever), and the pictures are now acceptable.  **The video footage of the same event on this camera looks just fine, so I'm glad I had it!Overall, I'm glad I bought this camera and would recommend it.

But, having checked it out, I was disappointed it was out of **parallax by about 30%. That to me, is completely out of order, even for a viewfinder camera. I wrote to Canon, but their response did not impress me. All they did, was to suggest a viewfinder camera would not be as accurate as an SLR. I checked out other Powershots in stores, and the problem was the same. I guess most people use the preview screen to take shots these days, but the viewfinder is better in bright sunlight and for a quick snap-shot. I used to test cameras, so I know a bit about the parallax problem you get with viewfinder cameras. But I repeat, to be so far out is unacceptable, and defeats the object of having a viewfinder in the first place. So, if you intend to use the viewfinder, forget about buying a Powershot. Sadly, this model is one of the few point and shoots that still use a viewfinder. A suggestion, go for a EVF camera, a sort of mid-point between a point and shoot, and an SLR.**This means what you see through the viewfinder, and what the sensor sees is out by about 30%", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "definitely not for kids or indoors", "Author": "M.

I usually shoot with a Nikon D70 DLSR and have a bunch of lenses for that, but this little Canon is great for casual shooting. I use it for 'snap shots' of the family when it is more important to get a candid shot of the people then to have the best technical shot. It is so much smaller then a DSLR so it is much easier to travel with. The manual controls are very good, they are easy to access and cover pretty much everything you need. I often shoot in either aperture priority (Av) or shutter priority (Tv), but also sometimes shoot in either full manual or full auto.The eight megapixels is more then I need for this kind of camera and ends up just adding noise to the images that causes anything over ISO 400 to be unusable. I keep the ISO at or below 200 when possible and get the best results at ISO 80, but ISO 400 is still usable.There are other Canon cameras that are much smaller like the SD850 IS, but I prefer the A720 IS because of the manual features and it has a nice grip that makes hanging onto the camera easy. But the SD850 IS is a better camera for novice shooters where simplicity and small size are more important.Another important difference between the SD850 and the A720 is that the A720 uses two AA batteries, the SD850 uses a rechargeable lithium-ion. The lithium-ion battery is much better, it takes more shots on a charge and cycles the flash much faster. The AAs cause the length of time between shots with flash to be very long. Rechargeable AA batteries work better for this then non-rechargeables, but are still not as good as lithium-ion. The best way to use either camera is to have backup batteries with you so you never run out of power.The things that keep this camera from being five stars:- Noisy at ISO 400 and above (this is aggravated by the excessive 8MP count)- The manual focus does not work in macro mode, where you need it most- Uses AA instead of Lithium-Ion (for some, this is a plus)If you are taking snap shots and want a little extra control, this is a great camera an a better choice then a DLSR.", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "P.

Amazon.com still has, overall, the best price (even including shipping).I got this camera for my wife who wanted a good combination point-n-shoot and of manual control options.  We researched several others in the price range and certainly the Nikon was a good competitor.  But we have both used and enjoyed Canons for years and, in the end, decided to stick with Canon...mostly just so we wouldn't have to learn a different strategy for the various controls.  For us, this was a good decision, as we were up-n-running with the A720IS right out of the box.We have not used this little camera so far; haven't had a lot of time.  But my wife is already pretty proficient with it having used it around the house and at the zoo.  We will be on photo-safari in Kenya in a few weeks and by all of the practicing with the A720IS so far, I suspect it will be a wonderful camera companion for my wife.The large 2.5\" LCD and the optical viewfinder are great.  We have used cameras without the optical viewfinders and have vowed never to have a camera with one again.  The optical viewfinder on the A720IS fill the bill for us just fine.  The large LCD is still completely useless in bright light situations (especially for those harsh mid-day sunny shoots...which I know we shouldn't be trying to take pictures in...but sometimes you just don't have a choice); but that is a problem with all of the contemporary point-n-shoot cameras.  I recently purchased a nice bellows-style LCD hood that attaches with velcro and so far it has completely and satisfactorily solved the LCD washout issue.  So, with that challenge solved, this is a great camera.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for an inexpensive, flexible, point-n-shoot style camear...especially to anyone that would like to have the option of just about any level and type of manual control that you could want.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "great pictures, many options, poor instructions", "Author": "Peter McCandless \"Peter Mac\"", "ReviewID": "R11R1O6MUJUZ9X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera.

I found this camera to be fantastic for tourist shots. I'm a very active composer of shots, intensively using the zoom to frame shots. Because of this, I was a bit concerned about it only having two batteries and some comments about battery life in these amazon reviews. However, I found I was able to get about 350 pictures for each set of rechargeable batteries. I suspect this difference from other users is due to my infrequent use of the electronic image display for composing shots; I'm a viewfinder user. The only time I used the display was for closeups, when the viewfinder had parallax problems and didn't line up the image correctly. Otherwise, image quality was great and the 6x lens worked great for getting in close. (Macro quality was also excellent, for the other kind of getting in close.) My only complaint about the lens is that the wide angle is equivalent to about a 35 mm lens. For many tourist shots, a wider angle would be nice, say about 28 mm. But, I knew this going in and learned to live with it. The flash unit is small, but provided adequate flash outdoors up to about 8 feet, which is about all that can be expected. Closeups with the flash have a lens shadow in the lower right side of the image, so users need to compensate for this while shooting or when editing. The flash does take several seconds to recharge, but not much longer than other digitals I've used with four batteries.

I gave it to my mother and bought a S3is on sale.  The S3is was very nice, but too big for my purposes.  I travel a LOT and the S3is took up too much space both in my luggage and when walking around.  So I sold it and got this A720is.I enjoy the A720is very much.  It is not tiny, but small enough to lug around and put in a jacket pocket.  The Image Stabilization works very well, those low light pictures which were just a little fuzzy with the A700 which didn't have IS are now tack sharp.Two AA's last a long time for me.  It seems to do best with my 2700 mAH NiMH batteries.  Sanyo Eneloops didn't work too well for me, not sure why, maybe their voltage drops below the cutoff point too quickly.The image quality is quite good.  I have the same complaint as always, I don't need a kazillion megapixels, I would rather have less noise and wider dynamic range than more megapixels.  So really, the image quality is the same comapared to the A700, you just get more megapixels.  And it does still blow out highlights, just like the A700.I keep the ISO at 80 whenever I can.  Pictures are acceptable at 100 and 200, but above that it does get very noisy.  Although I'd rather have a noisy picture at 1600 than none at all, so I guess I can't complain.What I like a lot is that this camera has many of the options a DSLR offers.  You can use aperture or shutter speed priority and all manual mode.  You can under and overexpose, set the white balance manually and then it has a lot of other fun options I don't use much but some may enjoy them.  You can also focus manually, but it's near impossible to tell when you are in focus.Of course there is still the flash issue.  It can take upwards of 5 seconds to recharge the flash which is painful if you're trying to take another picture right away.  I don't do a lot of flash photography, so it doesn't really bother me, but if you are going to take a lot of indoor kid pictures, this is probably not the camera for you.All in all, I would highly recommend this camera.

After playing with the zoom function a bit, it began to make a horrible grinding noise whenever opening or closing.  This camera also had another defect.  My battery light indicator would come on even after putting in freshly charged batteries.  I realize from the reviews that I got a defective camera, but searching more extensively on the web, it sounds like getting a defective Canon is a lot easier than winning the lottery.  Buy with caution and if the lens seems noisier to you than it should, or if you get even ONE malfunction with the lens upon the first few days of operating, return or exchange while you still can.

You should PLAN to get 90% of shots that are taken point and shoot OUT OF FOCUS.  Then, when you want to try to take another one, plan on the camera taking a good 7 seconds or so before it comes back to life and lets you.

One is the sensitivity to any subject area that has artificial lighting on it. I was shooting my family (not with a gun:-) in our family room. We have white paneled walls with tall plants in front of them. I was taking shots fairly close up with my subject filling about 50% of the frame, with the flash on, and the recessed ceiling lighting, that illuminates the white walls, was flaring the wall terribly (even through all the plants) on every shot. Although the flash illuminated the subject very nicely, the background looked terrible. So the camera is far too sensitive to all bounced light, except for that coming off the flash. I then switched to the camera's manual mode, with aperture priority, and kept clicking down until I was able to negate the background flare but then my subject started getting too dark, even though there was plenty of ambient light to illuminate the scene.I also notice that when I try to shoot \"product stills\" with studio lighting (softbox diffusers on elevated stands) it is very difficult to control the flaring of the image (over exposure where the light source reflects off the object).  It is too bad that digital cameras can not come close to delivering \"what you see is what you get\". At least with film, it delivers pretty much what your eye can detect through the view finder. But with digital, the subject may look just fine to the naked eye, but the camera sees it different, and when you take the shot, light sources of all kinds \"burn out\" the subject with overexposure on important surfaces of the subject matter, washing out color saturation. This does not usually happen when you are in flash mode but it is much more difficult to create \"mood shots\" with digital. And when you are in flash mode, you can't eliminate the very distracting hard shadows created on surfaces behind your subject, with the flash on.The other thing that is troublesome, is that although the camera has image stabilization, I was very surprised to see so many shots that blurred, when the subject moved their head. I know that shutter speed is a critical element here but I have not yet figured out why so many of my shots are being thrown away as a result of trying to shoot without the flash in well lit rooms.Another word of advice. Do not use regular AA batteries. I made the mistake of taking four spare AA batteries with me when I drove the kids around to see and photograph Christmas lights. I was shocked to see that after only a handful of shots, the camera demanded fresh batteries, and I burned through my first 2 plus the 4 spares after only about 10-15 photos. Be sure  to buy the rechargeables with a rating of 2100 mAH or higher so that you can shoot a lot without disappointment and have backups with you at all times that can handle the high drain of the camera.  I can't imagine buying a camera that has batteries that are not AA because that would get to be a very expensive problem. It is nice that  Canon uses AA's but be sure you spend the money on the rechargeable AA's with the high mAH rating, which is essentially the amount of juice the battery will store for use before it needs recharging. You want to be close to or above 2000. It will say on the retail packaging what the rating is. If it is not on the outside of the package, try to see if you can see it on the side of the battery itself (usually is printed there).", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Versatile Camera", "Author": "Richard L.

This Powershot A720 IS was a very nice surprise! I got it for $199 (just before it went up to $250) and I expected far less than what I got! The picture quality is fantastic; the zoom is expansive (24x combined), and the movie quality is definitely nothing to sneeze at.

It eats batteries.  With only 2 AA batteries I can only get 20 - 30 pictures using a flash before I need to change batteries.  I can get more if shooting outside but not much if you use the zoom and LCD display.  The delay between flash photos is very long when waiting for the flash to recharge.  This camera takes a very long time to focus and is not good for \"candid\" shots.  This is my third Canon camera and a big disappointment in the picture department. It does take decent quality video but it uses the memory very quickly.It does come with a memory card included with the camera.  BUY A MEMORY CARD.  You can only get about 18 pictures on the card that comes with the camera.  If you were going to include a memory card with the camera it could at least hold enough pictures to be somewhat useful.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Toy Camera", "Author": "Som S.
