{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally Pleased", "Author": "Big Ben \"Deal or No Deal\"", "ReviewID": "R34JWBONCKB0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Defender DVR SN 501 with 8 cameras was just what I was looking for in a home video survalance system. The compact DVR unit made it simple to install in the living area of our home and be able to keep it out of sight of visitors. The cables and extensions were small in diameter, making them easy to pass through walls and floors and easy to manage. I am able to go online and view my home from a computer anywhere in the world. I can also receive an Email of an alarm event on my Iphone and then connect with the same Iphone and visually see what the cameras are seeing. This Defender SN501 is my second system that I have installed. The first DVR system the \"Black*** by Netrome\" was a big piece of junk and did not last a year and customer support was non existant and could not speak ledgiable English.This is not the case with the Defender Customer Support, 24/7 help and courtious. I have only found one drawback with Defender Systems, they are not \"Mac computer w/Safari\" supported and I have to revert to a Windows Internet Explorer to veiw my system. My Iphone with Safari works though, go figure.Defender SN501-16CH-007 16-Channel H.264 DVR Security System (Black)", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "kat", "ReviewID": "R3J4VH2M6ORSBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We set up the dvr and two cameras in under an hour. Now, getting our router setup to allow other computers to view the cameras over the internet was more complicated. It was due to our DSL provider, not the fault of the equipment. I love this system. The camera clarity is amazing. The split screen choices for viewing on a tv are flexible and easily allow my elderly mother to push 1 button to cycle through different cameras and another button to cycle through 1, 2, 4, 9, or 16 camera splits screens. She loves the split screen choice that allows her to watch one camera in a big picture in the center of her tv, and the others in mini-screens area the center. The night vision is very clear. In a completely black room I could cleary make out a white sock on a white sheet covered bed. The ribbing on the sock was clear. The customer support people were very helpful and the instructions for set up in the manual are easy to understand. They also have a video you can watch that shows you step by step how to install and set up options. I also have a (non dvr) Q-see system. I have had the Q-see for years. It was much less expensive, has no dvr, no web access, and the camera quality was not as good. The q-see is similar to a very nice new Ford Escort. This defender system is a Lexus.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expect problems and disappointment with this system", "Author": "Gary Stonge \"GSO\"", "ReviewID": "R35B7QAFQH2MPB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This system seemed to have nice features from the ad, but .... it also has big problems. First, the hard drive on mine is squealing after just 3 months usage. I have contacted the manufacturer for replacement because Amazon offers no help. The vendor does not reply to these problems.The 2nd big problem is you can not view the cameras remotely unless your internet provider gives you a static IP address. In my case, Hughes Network would double my monthly charge to provide this feature and I would also need to purchase new hardware. It would be nice to know this requirement in advance, however the support team at Defender is clueless about this issue.Lastly, support by the Defender team is horrible - expect to wait for a minimum of 30 minutes to speak to someone - it will usually be longer or the phone system will kick you off. Very disappointing system and support for $1000.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "value minded system, pay for what you get!", "Author": "feldme", "ReviewID": "R5WDAJSUWVX8G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I previously have the Defender Seninel 3. Their new Model SN501 blows away the older line and all other competitors bundled packages. Most DVRs with these specs cost as much as amazon sells the entire package with 8 cameras and cables for!! You may be able to assemble a better system a la cart but it cost 4-5x more and won't be as easy to install for the non-professonal.The DVR now has a GUI interface and supports iPhone viewing. It's now 500GB. The cameras that are included are similar to the older cameras during the day, but their night vision is small areas is phenomenal. My bedroom with lights off looks light daylight hours but in black and white. I added the 4 pack of long range cameras to monitor the cul de sac in front, side street behind and driveway. The clarity of the Long Range cameras is impressive for the price. Similar long range cameras can cost as much as I paid for 4 from Amazon for one! The night vision on the long range cameras is superb. I can see inside cars parked in my driveway at night (with no outside lights on) when a general purpose camera would barely be able to see the outside of the car.Installation is a breeze and they have now included 4 60' foot extensions so you don't have that added cost.Every minor issue I had with Sentinel 3 system has been addressed/upgraded and the SN501-16CH is hands down the highest quality, complete turn key value oriented system on the market.3 MONTH UPDATEalthough packed with features and cameras are an improvement you ultimately pay or what you get.Customer service is absolutely terrible. You will NEVER speak to a live person when you call. You can leave a voicemail or use online chat but that's it. Not exactly what I want with a $1000+ purchase.Next the iPhone viewing is sub-standard at best. I can view camera 1 and when selecting another camera about 90%of the time it won't load so I have to restate safari, re-login, only for it not to work again.Hardly convienient to check If garage doors are closed when I can turn around and drive home faster that i can get it to work ( if ever).Ultimately you pay for what you get.I recommend installing with an UPS (I have a 1250W that allows DVR and 12 cameras to run for 90+ minutes) as it will run through power outages and buffers any chance the cameras don't fully rest wth short power failures.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "the cameras is ok, but the system Backup function is horrible.", "Author": "Henry Yang \"themightyhenry\"", "ReviewID": "R3ODZYGRZ16SCR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "beside the set up, and the camera are ok.Backup speed is really slow.While backing up, there is nothing happens, you can't move the mouse, the system doesn't do any recording.It says online as it can record up to 2.5 years, which is not true,  maybe the were saying if the system is set up with only 1 camera, and with lowest resolution, and lowest sensitive motion detection. which means you can't see crap in  the recording.30 mins with 11 cameras with regular high setting, it takes about 900 mb.The sensor is overly sensitive, it constantly record, even there is nothing.Once the mouse was moved, the search list restarts itself.It said it can detect FAT32 bit, and maximum support for back up till 1.5 T. But it doesn't do what as its description.The max backup click is 2 GB, which is ridiculous.The system is made of cheap material, if you press the bottom too hard, the bottom would get stuck inside of the box.The cameras are also made of cheap material; some of the stands don't even screw on to the base.  But since we only use 11 out of 16 cameras, we let that go by.The support line is no help, normally it doesn't even answer your call, and the online support doesn't work.The quality of recording image is very poor.The recording doesn't show anything some time.Set it as recording 4 pictures per sec, but only the play is more like 4 second per picture.if you want to back up any footage for court use, dont waste your money on it.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ok, but network card burned after a year", "Author": "mgera981", "ReviewID": "RY78VXSK7821E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this system about 18 months ago for my parents. It worked ok, I don't have other brands as reference point. The configuration was not as intuitive/user-friendly as it could be. My dad and sisters found the settings too complicated so they always call me and my husband. My husband took hours to finally figure out how to configure the networking feature after I gave up. Once it was setup, it worked as expected.I have 15 cameras so i can record about 2 weeks of 24/7 footage before the HDD reaches its limit. This is enough for what I need but the claim \"Record over 8 years of video footage on the built-in 500GB hard drive\" is probably misleading. You can probably only achieve that if you only have one camera running at very low res.I would have given the product a 3 stars based on the above, but the network card burned out and i tried to reach the customer support and they don't sell spare parts nor were helpful about how I can go about to fix it. So now I can't access the cameras remotely anymore and it will be pricey to replace the console.I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap system", "Author": "Jesse \"-Jesse\"", "ReviewID": "R29WMM11N5WBLU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You get what you pay for... this system is very cheap.  Yes, it records video.  But the software is very bad, and it is not compatible with anything but Internet Explorer (and mobile phones).  It is very complicated to retrieve video from this system as well.

I cannot believe the ease of installation and how it worked so well, just out of the box.Recently one of our day/night outside video cameras caught a criminal destroying two other cameras in our system that protects our home and fenced yard.  The video clips were downloaded to a USB thumb drive with great ease and in addition to the files, included a reader so that others can view the evidence.A CD was burned for the city police and the prosecutor and we are now ready to pursue this in the justice system, of course with the benefit of the Defender SN501-16CH, it should be an open-and-shut case.We feel great about this purchase and love the idea that we can aid the police and courts by collecting digital evidence of crimes.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002XDQ7TK"}}
