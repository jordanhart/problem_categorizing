The camera, SD card, everything works great except a few items were missing from my kit that I ordered. I'm missing1- Lens/LCD Cleaning Kit1- Mini Table Size Tripod1- Pack of LCD Screen Protectors.I managed to grab this deal at a price of $812. You can't complain when the camera is $850.00 and you get that at a cheaper price and get all this other stuff for free basically.Another reason I downgraded it one star was because of the level of cheapness that some of the items were. The lens aren't entirely that great but do the job until you get canon ones, I got an olympus bag (not a canon bag), The SD card reader fell apart on me during the unboxing.I'll upload an unboxing of this kit soon so you can see that this is a legit deal in case you're thinking about buying it.Update:/ 4/21/12: I received my missing parts days after I complained. The package was in a small case and was a simple mistake. I give them back another star for their quick customer service.Ryan", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "ED", "Author": "ed", "ReviewID": "RXXT8NGS3GHWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product was given as a gift, when I opened the box everthing was packed in great condition, the camera took great pictures and the battery lasted several hours on continual shooting", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Present for my wife!!", "Author": "Daniel E.

Robles", "ReviewID": "R1TGJYZJESYTEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say enough about the camera as far as the quality of the images produced and the functions you get. It is a great entry level DSLR packed with amazing features at a very reasonable price. In fact the price is so close to a point a shoot digital that it is almost a no brainer for the average Joe/Jane.The body is plastic compared to professional grade Canon cameras which makes it feel lighter than say the 60D. This is a plus if you like light weight cameras, but does leave you feeling cheated when holding the 60D in another hand. Still the flip out screen, HD video and easy to use interface makes this an amazing deal.As for the bundle, the only thing I really value is the memory card, filters, and the extra battery. Everything else is very poor quality and the tripod is a hazard. If you can get just the Battery/Memory bundle do that and save some money for higher quality supportive accessories. I recommend Magic Lantern installed for those wanting to maximize the functionality of this camera.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love My Cannon!", "Author": "Rashida Scott", "ReviewID": "RNH6T18UAGPTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My bundle arrived 4 days after I ordered it.
