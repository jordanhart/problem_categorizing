It is a great product, the pictures that I get from it is so powerful. I always have it ready and charge for where ever I go. I found out that after a rainy day when you use the regular view it comes back with not enough color , but If you take the same photo but use Landscape lens the colors are so vivid. If I take bad pics there is a symbol of a garbage can. I delete those away away and not have to wait to have them developed. I love using the SD Card instead of using the flim can's like I used to . Those days are over,It's a SD Card & the battery. The battery has to be charged If you are going to take small video's. It comes with a Red-eye-flash with or with out. Zoom's to 3x 7.0 MP. I got the Silver. Then the same sister went &  bought the same one in Red.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0011DO8OO"}}
