The display screen is clear and photos taken in areas without a lot of light came out perfectly. I just wish there were more colors to choose from than just red. Overall a great product and easy to download photos to computer for printing.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Maryann Chavez", "ReviewID": "R34LAELUKJC4PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i purchased the same exact camera but mine is purple in color i bought it at target on sale for $70 it is such a great camera its takes great pictures even when there is not to much light im very happy with this camera", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised by this camera", "Author": "Julie Luoma", "ReviewID": "RCIXE2PUFIK0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I couldn't afford the camera I really wanted, I bought this one instead.  It had more features than the other camera I had been looking at, and it was half the price.  I was just hoping that it would be adequate.  It is.The face recognition and image stabilization are terrific features that ensure clear pictures even under less than perfect circumstances, and the rapid fire setting is great for capturing babies and small children in candid moments of happiness.  The touch screen is just a bonus.For the money it's hard to imagine finding a better camera with this many features.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked great...then FAILED miserably", "Author": "L. Gould", "ReviewID": "RDZ9KQ18HYZNY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on sale at Target for $88 or so just after Christmas and was excited. I loved the fact that it had a touch screen, in-camera editing, frames, and lots of other features. I mounted it on a toy train and it survived a few wrecks. I put it in a plastic bag and took it out in the snow in it didn't seem to freeze. I took it on a boat tour and it wasn't damaged by sea spray. Then I took it to the airport in April. When i got to the airport to take photos of my grandmother heading home after her vacation, it worked fine; no problems or even a hint of there being an issue. I put it in my pocket when we were done but when I got into the car to view my photos, the lens opened, buzzed, and then retracted. I tried again and the same thing happened. And again. And again. And Again. This apparently is a common problem. Overall, I enjoyed this camera and was extremely disappointed when it broke only after a few months of use.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "Kathleen T.

It takes great pictures, has a quick snap reaction and a wide variety of features to use for getting the perfect picture.

This camera has more features than cameras costing 3 times as much. The picture quality is good and the video is good. The video is taken in .avi so it plays easily with windows, no conversions needed. It has a few weak points, but not killers for the price like when taking a video the sound cuts out when zooming. It has a lag in correcting for brightness from area to area when videoing, but nothing terrible. You hear clicks when zooming while taking video. This is a great kids or everyday knock around camera. It has tons of fun features that kids and teens would love. The low price of this camera concerns me about the longevity of it, you get what you pay for, but its a blast to use.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected.", "Author": "Brandie Alonso", "ReviewID": "R1IQF85GG48FO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This a surprisingly nice camera for its price. The touchscreen is nice and the camera is easy to use. The pictures are nice, but any pics taken in the dark may result in closed eyes because of the 2 second delay after the flash. This is especially true for pictures of children or babies in dim light.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "11 month camera", "Author": "Kam M. \"Kam 17\"", "ReviewID": "R5EGFTT7EZ660", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved this camera for 11 months and then it started getting quirky.  If you recharged the battery, it was better. If you fidgeted around, like warming up the battery, it would work better.The lens has now officially frozen, and now, at 13 months, it has officially died and Polaroid will not honor the warranty.  I was told fixing it would cost more than a new camera.Never figured out some of the flashing buttons. The manual doesn't tell you, you have to get the on screen manual.I thought it took beautiful pictures, during its lifetime, which unfortunately is not very long.PRO: it took beautiful pictures. While it lastedCON: left about 11 months.  Difficult to get to some of the instructions as they are on the DVD which you have to blow to get to the manual. I never figured out the flashing lights, which happens quite often.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE", "Author": "R.

The camera would freeze, and wouldn't let me turn it off or push anything. It wouldn't shut off it's self, not until I popped the battery out and back in. When I would put the battery back in it would still continue to freeze.I sent it back to the website I bought it from, and they sent me a replacement, thinking that one camera was defective, but the same thing happened with the replacement. I simply returned that one and got my money back. I don't think that this product is made well.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera for Christmas", "Author": "M.
