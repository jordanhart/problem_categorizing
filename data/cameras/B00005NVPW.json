I have to say that this camera, after just two weeks, has exceeded my expectations. I wanted a camera that could replace my beloved Olympus Stylus as a point and shoot camera. It easily does that. In fact I find that I can use it much like I did my beloved Leica M rangefinder camera. Any digital consumer camera today still does not rival even the cheapest p/s film camera. But the advantages of a digital camera more than overshadow any image quality gap between film and digital cameras.Here are the strengths of this camera (in no particular order):1. Takes non-proprietary batteries. DO get rechargable NiMHbatteries. Camera uses 2.  (...))2. Flash can be turned off. I rarely use the flash for a natural look when in \"lecia-type\" shooting situations. Good fill flash.Flash is far enough off axis so that red eye doesn't seem to exist.3. Can set EV +- 2 stops for exposure control.4. Can set shutter speeds down to 16 seconds. Great for low-light shooting.5. Metering system is very, very good in general. can also do spot metering.6. camera is not too small or too big. it makes it easy to take anywhere and not be a burden.7. Cover protects lens when camera is turned off.8. Very good image quality9. Good software on camera and loaded onto computer. camera isintuitive to use.10. Macro modeMisses:1. some might need more than 2x zoom.2. Software does not work under Windows953. No neck strap. Just wrist strap supplied. 4. Only 8mb card supplied with camera.5. shutter is responsive with no big lag from the time the shutter is pressed to when the image is taken, but it takes about 6 seconds to write the image to disk before you can take the next picture. (unless you use the .8mb burst mode)More Advice:Don't bother buying the dock. USB cable alone is fine fortransferring images. Save the dock money and buy a bigger compactflash card and rechargable batteries. This is a lot of camera for the money. Hopefully it will hold upover the next few years until it's time to buy the next generationof digital camera. Good luck!

What a great camera!  The photos are great. This is the 3rd set of digital cameras I have purchased for my office in the past 5 years, and digital cameras have come a long way.  6 months ago I purchased an olympus for [a high price] and that camera had too many bells and whistles that nobody in the office could figure out. This camera is simple. All I do is just leave it on the highest picture quality setting, insert the 128MB card that I purchased seperately and I can take up to 129 pictures using the flash on one battery charge!  I \"borrowed\" the office camera that I purchased for the last 2 weekends when my family and I visited the Shenendoa National forest.  Wow!!  The pictures could not be any better.  My husband and I are planning on purchasing one of our own!!  I strongly suggest this camera to anyone who is purchasing a new digital camera.", "Date": "October 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great features for the price -- near-pro quality, super easy", "Author": "kate", "ReviewID": "R2R901T29ZR69L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Digital cameras in general are getting better, but you can't beat quality like this. Though I was initially looking at the more talked-about Olympuses and Canons, this camera gives excellent color fidelity, great resolution, and point-and-click ease of use coupled with advanced features.I use Mac OS X, and no software installation is required to use the camera -- it works seamlessly with ImageCapture and the new iPhoto, including being able to control the camera (erase pics from the card, etc) from the iPhoto app.The direct USB connectivity is great. I was able to quickly and seamlessly download the photos without having to use a compactflash adapter, which I suspect will result in longer media life due to the lack of the physical stresses of jamming the card in and out.It looks like a film camera (as opposed to some of the Nikons which twist), and feels comfortable, with a nice weight to it. The body is plastic, but feels fairly solid, though it doesn't feel quite like the most expensve cameras. It feels like the most expensive camera you could buy at a drugstore -- well-put-together, but not top-of-the-line.The ergonomics are very well-designed and easy to understand -- the buttons are well placed for easy operation without any accidental activations. The camera has a built-in battery save feature you can enable which turns it off after a minute of inactivity, and has easy-to-navigate hierarchal menus to control many aspects, like date/time stamp, image quality, and sounds.The image quality is really excellent, better than I expected. Though the 3.1 megapixels is certainly impressive, what's more important is that the quality in those few million pixels is right on, with good range in lights and shadows, good detail (the camera includes macro and distance modes for customizing focus), and very good color fidelity. There are white-balance controls for different lighting (flourescent, tungsten, flash etc) which enhance the color fidelity in usually-tough lighting situations. There is a hint of jaggedness in high-contrast areas, but it's not too distracting. Overall, there is none of the graininess that I've seen with other digital cameras.The camera can take pictures in only 3 modes -- color, sepia, or black and white (some cameras have lots of built-in effects.) For cropping and sharing, it's nice anyway to have a program like Adobe Photoshop Elements, which will let you use all the filters you might want.One of the best parts of this camera is the lens -- you can buy accessories like a telephoto attatchment or a wide-angle, for even more flexibility. I am thrilled with this camera. As an art student, it suits my needs perfectly -- optical zoom and enough pixels to play with were very important to me. However, there are a few cons, which can be expected for all these features at the price. Unlike the top-of-the-line digicams, there's a separate viewfinder (as opposed to true through-the-lens -- parallax problems are slight, but there.) And maybe it's just me, but you can't seem to frame your picture on the LCD screen -- it seems to work only for reviewing photos. I wish there were a power adapter included for seamless recharging. The 8mb included memory is pretty skimpy considering historically-low memory prices -- it holds only 8 hi-res photos. The construction feels solid, but not tops. We'll see how it holds up.  All in all, this is a wonderful camera for the price, and Kodak didn't sacrifice image quality to cram in more effective pixels -- the images that come off the camera are ready to go. The additional lenses, ISO and white-balance adjustments mean you can take it further, but it functions as a point-and-shoot easy camera, and with Mac OS X anyway, there's no software you need to install at all. I highly recommend it for everyone from the first-timer who needs room to grow to the advanced amateur without unlimited funds.", "Date": "February 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "DX3900-Terrific", "Author": "Mr. Martin H. Schwartz", "ReviewID": "R241DM1GQS3JUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for about a week. It takes very sharp and colorful images. It is extremely easy to use as a point and shoot and there are also settings to refine your images under different situations (lighting,compression,EV,ISO,etc.).I am amazed at the picture quality for such an easy to use camera. I highly recommend this camera for anyone that wants to jump in to digital photography. It produces comparable results to 35MM film cameras and maybe even better.", "Date": "September 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the $$!!", "Author": "Kenny Evans \"blackdomer\"", "ReviewID": "R2S6LG43WQV1TV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I normally don't write reviews, but after reading that last one slamming this great camera (for all the wrong reasons), I felt compelled.The DX3900 was the only camera I could find that had optical zoom AND 3 megapixel resolution (...).  It's pretty simple to use (especially if you read the instructions and realize that many of the \"problems\" described by one reviewer are configurable and/ or the way it's SUPPOSED to work.  Jeez!)What's especially nice is the memory media (CompactFlash) which is available in sizes up to 512 MB (will hold over 700 pics at top resolution).The digital screen is a bit \"stuttery\", but it IS color and will reflect whatever mode you have it in (black/ white, sepia).  The camera also has a lot of adjustable features INCLUDING whether the zoom pauses when it changes from optical to digital zoom.The lens protector closes \"automatically\" when you shut the camera off, which is cool.  Downside is that it opens when you turn it on, even if you're just turning on to view pics you already took (it would be nice if the cover closed while in \"play\" or \"setup\" mode).I haven't bought the dock yet, but plan to.  One button downloading plus getting your batteries recharged adds to this camera's practicality.  Without the dock, your battery options are still pretty wide.  The camera comes with a long-lasting lithium battery pack, but can also use Ni-MH or tried and true AA batteries.This camera also has a decent number of adjustable photo options such as exposure compensation, exposure metering, and multiple resolution settings, including a lower-res mode that allows you to take a \"burst\" of photos (several in rapid succession... COOL!)By the way, for those who don't know, you CANNOT show digital zoom through an optical viewfinder, so don't be disappointed when you have to view the digital zoom through the screen.  Also, the higher resolution is for PRINTING pictures, not viewing them on screen... a task handled well by any low res jpeg producing hardware.Again, (...): 2x opitcal zoom, 3x digital zoom (6x total), 3.1 megapix, and a slew of cool options, I looked and looked, and couldn't find a better deal!", "Date": "December 13, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great point-and-shoot camera", "Author": "R.

I chose Kodak for its reputation and positive reviews, especially as to color quality. I was looking for a 3+ megapixel camera and chose the DX3900 because 1) it had an optical zoom (although I wish it had 3X instead of 2x) 2) It was one of the cheapest cameras in its class 3) Kodak reputation. I was put off at first by the plastic case, but the lighter weight is really an asset. Be careful, however. The lightness caused me to produce some blurry photos until I figured out I was in my heavier camera mode from my previous DC265. The 8 megabyte card is a joke - only 7 pictures. The 3.1 compressed mode doubles your pictures, but Kodak tells me not to use it if you intend to print your photos---Web use is just fine. You'll need to budget for at least a 128 or 256 Mb card. The first set of batteries lasted for 275 pictures, 20% of these were taken with flash. Like most cameras in its class, the LCD display is impossible to see in any kind of daylight; the optical viewfinder is a must -- also saves on battery life. Some reviewers complained about the lack of advanced features, but the basics are there along with a surprising number of manual settings (shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation, 4 flash modes, B&W;, sepia, etc).

I have owned 6 in the last 2 years.  Here they are: DC215, DC280, DC265, DC290, DX3600, and now the DX3900.  The DX3900 is very fast when snapping the photos.  Previous models had about a 1 second delay after pressing the shoot button thus making it difficult to capture those candid shots.  The DX3900 has virtually no delay (about 1/10th of a second).  Plus previewing your shots is significantly faster than previous models.  Obviously this model has a much faster processor.  The ISO Equivalent is 100 thru 400 and can be automatic or selectable.  For those of you who don't know what I am talking about, ISO is basically equivalent to film speed.  ISO 400 allows great pictures in lower light settings.  I love to turn off the flash and take pictures in the evening light or by candlelight.  Something that really can't be done on ISO 100 cameras.  Other bonuses to this model are the high megapixel of 3.1, the easy dock (sold separately), lens slider cover (versus press on cap).  Plus compact flash memory cards are hitting an all time price low.  I just bought 128mb card for $50.  I can take over 130 high quality pictures on this card.  Kodak has definitely outdone themselves on this camera, and at $399 you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "January 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed with Kodak DX 3900", "Author": "JVO (Satisfied Customer)", "ReviewID": "RAMKN9CW3TOXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently I purchased my Kodak 3900. This was after about 3 months of very intensive study and comparisons of digital cameras. I even bought a \"throw away dig cam\" just to get the feel of a dig cam.I won't mention its name to \"protect the innocent\". Good  American company but very low end camera and I got what I paid for. My Kodak 3900 is outstanding. With a 128MB card I get 129 pics at 3.1 megapixel. Set at 2.2 megapixel I get 170. Enough pics for me in either setting. I bought the camera dock and it works great. The software Kodak gives you is easy and good. I also use Adobe Home Deluxe ver. 4.0 which gives you more features. Once you learn the features of the camera it is really very easy to use. The pics are very detailed and crisp at 3.1. Flash works great. It is fairly small and compact. Also has an optical and dig zoom. .... Both match internet prices. In my opinion this is the best deal on a very good dig cam out there. That is why I bought it. I do not part with my money foolishly. The guys in the big yellow box out did themselves with the 3900. You will be hard pressed to find a better dig cam @ 3.1 megapixel than the Kodak DX 3900 for [the price].

It was my first venture into the digital camera field, and I didn't plan on doing anything too fancy with it.  I'll run through some of the highs and lows that I discovered.1. 3MP - Well it seems like it's a good deal, but there are a couple things to know.  If you don't ever plan on printing out your pictures, getting anything more that 2MP is a waste.  If you keep the picture at a size where it fills up your screen, even the best monitors don't display better than 2MP.  Besides, a camera needs to have good electronics to process all that information.  When I compared pictures taken with this camera against my dad's DX290 (which is only 2MP), the DX290 photos were much more crisp and vibrant.2. This camera is really, really easy to use.  If you like simple menus with lots of options, this is for you.  There are a lot of adjustable settings, such as ISO, exposure, shutter speed, etc.3. The camera is quick to take a shot, which isn't true with many of the digital cameras.  It is almost instantaneous.  However, the camera is a little slow to record the shot to memory, so you have to wait a little before your next picture.4. The colors on this camera are not very vibrant.  There is a bluish haze that seemed to cover most of my pictures.  If people were more than 5 feet away, their faces looked like they were blue from holding their breath.Overall, I really liked the ease of use and features on the camera.  But when it came down to it, I didn't like the picture quality.  They was definitely something missing.I ended up returning the camera and buying the Canon S110.  It's much more compact, and just about as easy to use.  With respect to picture quality, the Canon is much better with appropriate lighting.  It lacks a little in dim light, but so does the Kodak.In the $400 range, you can also check out the CoolPix 775.  It takes much better pictures indoors than the Canon or Kodak, but it lags behind both outdoors with good lighting.Good luck.", "Date": "February 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "You will think it's great if this is your first DC", "Author": "\"smokingbear\"", "ReviewID": "RUU04KGRMVQ4F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Apparently this camera receives lots of user compliments ... But browse it carefully you will find that a great percentage of these positive comments are from first time digital camera buyers or users. I wonder whether their opinions will hold true after they have tried other digital cameras on the market. The truth is that there are better choices out there, even at similar prices.First let's look at a myth floating around among first time digital camera buyers:1. Mega Pixel is everything.Since a 3MP camera delivers a higher resolution than a 2MP camera, the picture it takes should be sharper. Sounds right? Not necessarily so. The quality of the output mainly depends on the quality of the lens and grains. A grainy 3MP photo taken with a lower quality lens is not necessarily better sharper than a low noise 2MP photo taken with a high quality lens. It happens that the photo taken with DX3900 contains lots of noise, and the 7 element in 6 group lens might not be as sharp as lens on digital cameras from other vendors in the same class.Ok, now let's talk about the camera:Design and built:DX3900 is very compact. It has a slim plastic body and is suprisingly light even with two AA batteries inserted. It has a sliding door style lens cover and you can only find a few buttons on the camera. (Everything is designed for simplicity).However, this design also brings out the issue of quality of construction. The battery door hatch and compact flash door hatch are extremely fragile. The first time I accidently dropped my DX3900 it broke the battery hatch door and the bottom of the case became cracked. Kodak initially asked $150 for fixing the battery door saying this is a flat fee. After my complaint about the high cost of fixing Kodak suddenly said somehow they calculated it wrong and I was charged $36 instead. I have to admit that their service is pretty fast though. (Two days after the phone call I got the fixed camera back.) The LCD is only 1.5 inch and it is not bright so you might have some problem reading it under bright sunlight. However I like the LCD menu very much, it is so easy to operate even a monkey can find all the options and settings and make the adjustment.Because I like high contrast photo and saturated color I always prefer Kodak color. The DX3900 does take photo with good color. But when I start to compare these with pictures I took with Kodak DC280 and DC290 a while ago I was hugely disappointed:The color of the photos taken with DX3900 looked very plain and dull. And then comes the worst part, the photos also have more noise than those taken with DC280 and DC290s.DC280 and DC290 are old generation 2MP kodak digital cameras. DX3900 is a 3MP digital camera of a new generation.  But everyone who has seen my photos can tell that the 2MP photos I took with the DC280 and DC290 are better than those taken with DX3900. I don't know what Kodak has done to the DX series, they did fix the DC280 and DC290s'low shtter speed problem but they failed to produce a camera that could take better pictures than their old geneation of cameras. And the build quality of Kodak DX series is definately inferior to those \"like a brick\" feeling DC280 and DC290s. I think this is really sad.Do I have anything to recommend with even lower price tag than the DX3900? Sure, Canon A40 and Fuji 2600Z. They are both 2MP, and I think they can compete well with DX3900.  Some suggestion for first time digital camera buyers: try and compare several digital camers before you make the final decision. What others are saying might not make sense to you. Try, compare and make decision for yourself.", "Date": "July 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "EASY TO USE", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3LVKS6FBBV3P6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera a few days ago. It is my first digital camera.

It is also very easy to grip. You need to use the LCD to use the digital zoom but it is not a huge inconvenience. If you are taking several pictures in a row there is an 8 picture burst, but they also process very rapidly at the regualr speed. So if you are trying to take several pictures you dont have to wait and wait like with some other cameras.

After all, with most digital cameras, you simply plug in a USB cable and open the supplied software - this takes about 10 seconds. So with the DX3900 you save maybe 5 seconds every time you download your pictures. Having said that, the 3900 is a very capable and respectable camera for the market in which it competes. Resolution is pretty good, although jpeg artifacts become visible in all the but least compression settings (whereas canon and sony cameras seem to do a better job with compression). Color accuracy is very good, and skies come out vivid blue. The zoom lens works nicely, and startup time is fast. The LCD is smooth and fluid, although not as bright as I am used to from canon and sony. If you are purchasing this camera for a beginning computer user, or if a bit of extra ease of use means more to you than saving a bit of money, then this is a great camera.

The DX3700 has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about $100, so I agonized over paying extra for the DX3900, but I'm extremely happy with it nonetheless.  The autofocus is the best I've had on any point-and-shoot camera, extremely accurate under all light conditions (e.g., midnight photo standing in front of the US Capitol with faces lit only by the Xmas tree); I find there are few wasted shots, even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones.  There seem to be only two meaningful differences between the cameras:  (1) the DX3700 zoom is only digital (i.e., electronic), but the DX3900 zoom is both digital and \"optical,\" so the physical lens also has a zoom, which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital zoom; and (2) the DX3700 has 8MB internal storage plus buy-your-own removable Smart Media cards, which apparently are favored in Japan/Europe, while DX3900 has no internal MB and buy-your-own removable CompactFlash cards, which are used more in USA, but price per megabyte (MB) storage is virtually the same (approx. $1/MB) for either medium.  Clearly, if you have a limited budget, the DX3700 is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures, but with next cheapest camera in the 3+ megapixel class currently around $500, even the DX3900 remains a good deal if you want a better zoom and/or this particular storage medium (I'm indifferent on the latter).  In practice, I have found that the combination of the digital and optical zoom (total 6x) allows for greater flexibility in picture-taking and I suspect the digital zoom alone on the DX3700 (only 3x) would have been less useful; if you take personal photos for posterity (as opposed to for business or temporary purposes), this affects photo quality as much as the number of pixels and should be an important consideration.  Other pluses: the DX3900 is extremely lightweight, but not flimsy, which had worried me, with memories of the old Brownie cameras; indeed, it's small enough to carry in my shirt pocket.  It's also a sleek, good-looking camera, with a lens that automatically retracts into a covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off, a useful feature for the careless like me.  I agree with all commenters who say don't bother with the proprietary docking station, which is just a plastic tray for $70.  The docking station is supposed to be one-touch no-brainer transfer of photos to your computer, but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with a wire.  Downloading 25-50 pictures seemed to take a minute or less to my computer, which I think is relatively miraculous (compared to how long it takes to download from the Internet if you don't have high-speed access).  The Kodak software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use; Kodak is the Disney or MacDonalds of the photo world and I think even my mom could figure it out (even if I think she would need help installing it, but that would be even more true of other digital camera manufacturers, I'd bet).  Best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for e-mailing, a real time-saver when you want to share photos with others electronically.  Also don't let anyone tell you that you need to replace the Kodak paired batteries that come with the camera with Kodak ones; you can use other brands of AA batteries, although the manual says they need to be 1.2 volt (i.e., rechargeable variety) and not the standard 1.5 volt (non-rechargeable) kind; there's little reason not to be rechargeable anyway, which are more cost-effective.  In a few years, you'll no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel cameras for the same price, but from what I've read, beyond 3 megapixels, you can't really tell the difference except at huge enlargment sizes (i.e., bigger than 8x11), and most snapshots are only 4x6 or maybe 5x7, so what would be the point?  So, in sum, this is a very good camera value if you don't want to let once-in-a-lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film-quality 3 megapixel camera prices to drop, yet you don't want to spend what Canon, Nikon and others are charging ($500+).", "Date": "January 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Can't Get Better Pictures Any Easier!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RKYSYIFVTBX31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Camera!

The docking station is very convenient and simple to operate. It functions similar to a \"hot sync\" cradle of a Palm Pilot. You drop the camera into the cradle, push the button on the cradle, and presto! Your .jpg image files are then easily transferred to your PC. The cradle also serves as a charging base for the NiMH camera battery pack.Just as a note... not all NiMH batteries will charge in the camera via the cradle. The instruction book warns about this. In order to have batteries that charge, you must use the Kodak brand battery pack (until someone else makes something else that works!) The battery pack has to be installed a certain way. It looks like there might be some kind of mechanism in the camera that is activated via the battery pack. A second battery pack is relatively cheap ($14.95 from Kodak, or less that $10 if you search the web ;-) so I bought one online.I had a \"starter\" digital camera a couple of years ago.

I purchased the DX3900 expecting a significant improvement over my Sony 1.6MP Mavica, which while a decent camera, uses a floppy disc with resulting high image compression.  I was both very surprised and dismayed to find the overall performance of the Kodak 3MP hardly any better and in some respects worse.While I admit this camera is very easy to use and that it delivers reasonably acceptable quality pictures in brightly lit outdoor conditions (perhaps the reason for all the rave reviews), indoors I find the performance very poor.  The autofocus is unreliable in even medium indoor lighting (forget about low light), resulting in an a fair porportion of the shots turning out out-of-focus.  Also, there is a lot of digital noise and none of the dozens of indoor shots I've tried could be described as truly sharp, crisp and full of detail.In addition to this, the capture time is annoyingly long and seems to increase somewhat as more shots are taken, especially when using the flash.  I recorded times as long as 14 seconds - too long if you ask me.The shutter speed in AUTO mode was on average 1/20 seconds or so indoors.  Even using the flash, this is too long to get jitter free pics. Nor was there any noticable difference if I increased the ISO.  All that did was increase the noise.Build quality is only fair and I'm not very impressed with the image editing software included. I'll be returning it.Overall, if you're not too picky and only intend on shooting web shots or something, this camera will do the job.  But then, so will a much cheaper camera.

This is not much of an issue for me since it is big enough to do the job needed as an LCD, but it would have been nicer to have a larger one since you can't see much detail on the small screen.  Also the pictures taken tend to be bigger then was is shown in the LCD and viewfinderAnother issue is the camera door.  When it is held shut with only a very light spring, which does not offer very much protection for the camera lens.  Because of this, I would suggest that you have a good camera bag to protect the camera and lens.The last issue that I have is the need for the docking station.  I currently do not own one because of the price, but since I can not plug in a AC adapter into the camera I am using the batteries at all times, but at this point I have taken about 100 pictures using both the LCD and viewfinder and the batteries are still going strong.Overall, this is a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to take great pictures.

If I could just keep my kids from turning it on.Kodak makes a really nice optional kit with padded bag, charger, battery pack and international plug adapters. Useful when traveling. Speaking of the battery pack ... it is made so that it can NOT be inserted incorrectly in either the camera or the charger. Nice touch Kodak.Sometimes the speed with which the camera stores images to the CF card can be frustrating. Get over it and be patient. This issue is not unique to Kodak. If you know ahead of time that you need to take many shots in rapid succession Kodak has implemented a burst mode. The downside is you must go to a menu to activate it. Also the picture quality must be reduced for this function. You can take 8 pictures in rapid fire. Remember to return this to your normal setting.Going on a trip? Look for sales on large capacity CF cards. I added a pair of 128MB to my kit. Paid less than [price] apiece. It's like carrying 30 rolls of film without the bulk (2 shoe boxes) and hassle of loading the film. Of course everyone knows that with digital every picture is a keeper (hmmm) so how does 8 to 900 or more perfect pictures stored on a postage stamp sized device sound? Friend at work recently bought a 1Gigabyte CF card! WOW! Don't know if it works with this camera but can you imagine? I love technology.Word to the wise - download to your PC or MAC frequently. Don't and you will become hysterical the first time you screw up your CF card. The manual warns you and Murphy is everywhere. Personal experience - my daughter lost 220 shots on a SmartMedia card in her digicam. Imagine losing 900 pictures? Ouch.Recently took the camera for 2 weeks in Peru back to back with a week in the UK. Got great shots. Will soon share the non-personal ones on [another website] under user \"vand21\". Every seen Machu Picchu? Incredible!The camera comes with a video cable and get this. It can output to TVs in both NTSC (USA) and PAL (Europe and South America). Useful when traveling.Complaint? Maybe one. Took picture looking out at a clouded mountain top. The image part that was white had multiple bands of white rather than a smooth light to dark transition. This may be a common problem with digital cameras. I don't know. I plan to ask Kodak about this. If you have Internet access and provide your E-Mail to Kodak at registration they send you links to get the most out of your camera. Kinda online training. They also have links to many other neat sites to make using your camera fun. Nice followup Kodak.Their software can download, rotate, store, create albums, email friends or print your photos and it has a very non-techy user interface (simple to use). Behind the scenes the email function automagically reduces your humunguous 500K images to under 60K so your friends with slow access won't send you \"hate mail.\" It does this without affecting the original.Yeah you can add lens but I would advise against it if your goals are similar to mine. If you do go for the lens you will need an adapter. Look for it. A word of caution - do not leave the lens attached when are not taking pictures that require it. Remember the body of the camera is plastic. Guess what will break if it gets bumped or bangs into something?Camera comes with a wrist strap. Use it. Saved me several times on my trip. If the camera is not strapped to your wrist make sure you keep it where it can't be stolen. Pickpockets are keen on digital cameras but more than that think how valuable and irreplaceable your photos (inside the camera) are!I am having a wonderful time with this camera. I hope you find these comments useful. Oh! Kodak has a 4.0 MEGAPIXEL version if you want more.

I've been a die-hard SLR fan for years, I've finally found a digital camera that's darn-near equivalent to my Nikon in terms of picture quality. The supplied software is more than adequate, although a good photo editor software package is always recommended whenever you are manipulating digital photos.Overall a great camera, the best in it's price range in my opinion.Follow up to my previous review - I've been using this camera more or less non-stop for the past 3 days and continue to be impressed with the quality and ease of use.  It has NEVER locked up or given me anything less than SPECTACULAR performance.  As for enlargements, I've made some wonderful 8 X 10's, they look awesome.  The supplied software works quite well, full screen preview is achieved via the 'full screen' button to the right of the picture or by double clicking on the picture, it's fairly intuitive and easy to navigate once you spend a few minutes working with the software.Finally, the docking station is a nice add-on, no fumbling with cables when you want to download photos into your PC, just place the camera in the dock and push a button, the rest is automatic and FAST.  The docking station comes with an extra set of batteries, nice to have an extra charged set in the camera bag.

If you have a laptop, viking has a nice PC Card adapter that works great. Another thing I am considering is the lens kit for the camera. It is only a 2x optical (but is damn inexpensive) The lens kit includes two close up lens, a telephoto lens, and a wide angle lens, and a case that can hold all this and the camera.I have taken some close up pictures of my orchid, and the results are amazing.

I usually set the megapixals at 1.8 for general use. I am always pleased with the way the camera works, there are plenty of setting options, but not so many that it is confusing. The b&w; and sepia settings are fun.I would recommend using Amazon's Ofoto for photo processing. They do a good job quickly, and it is fun to use their albums to share pictures online. I also use Ofoto's free photo editor, which is extremely basic. If you want something fancy, Amazon has a selection of good photo editing software.In addition to the the camera, I purchased the EasyShare dock, which is a must have for ease of use. It is well worth the price. It, like the camera, is gimmick-free.I purchased a 128mb compact flash for additional memory.

The price [I paid was] less than [what] I paid for the 1.3MP Canon two years ago and better than most new 2MP cameras.  I compared lots of cameras before I bought this one.  I really wanted an Olympus, Canon, Nikon or Fuji but kept coming back to this one.  I bought it mainly for the higher pixel count and especially the price.  It doesn't have the features of the others but again, the price was just too good to pass.  I really like the optional lenses that can be purchased and I plan to get them ASAP.  I'm going to try it on one of my telescopes and hope to capture some good astro-images.  I purchased the 128MB card which is a must for this camera because the 8MB card that comes with it holds a miniscule 8 pictures.  I will say that it doesn't feel quite as good as the Canon which has a heavier metallic body.  The Kodak is plastic but again most of the others I have held lately are also plastic.

Enlargements are yet to be seen. I also HATE with capital letters the DIGITAL ZOOM feature so much, if I hadn't spent the money I just did on this thing -- I WOULD TOSS IT IN THE TRASH! The only way you can use the digital zoom is by using the LCD monitor! It's insane! You have to zoom, stop, push select, pull the camera away, look into the LCD, zoom again and then take a photo. I am going to miss so many wonderful opportunities by having to take all these steps! They also eliminated the high/low light adjustment of this camera's LCD. The camera is also too small for me. I am 5'5\" and have small hands and I find the size awkward. I also have a very difficult time seeing out of the view finder. It's just badly designed. And so far, I have had the camera for 8 hours, and it has locked up and froze twice. My first Kodak DC 240 did that and I had to have it replaced. It looks like this one has a similar problem. And the on/off switch is in a very inconvenient place!The Kodak software also stinks.  It shows you this little snap shot maybe  2 x 3 inches in 1200 x 800 rez.  You can't zoom in or resize the photo in viewing mode like you could with their old software.  All you can do is setup a slide show which is preset with horrible defaults.  If you don't like the defaults, you have to manually change them every time you run a slide show.  I am so mad I bought this heap of trash, you don't know! Frankly, on a A to F scale, I would rate this camera a solid F for FLUNK! It stinks. I wish my Kodak DC240 would take higher resolution photos because this new thing is going backwards with technology. Kodak, your developers lost it! Sorry.
