{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera, Great Photos & Great Price!", "Author": "Doctor A.", "ReviewID": "R2JOZ5OBLNZ7KD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an experienced DSLR photographer, I needed a small and simple do-all vacation camera that would work for both my wife and me. The Nikon L610 is a superb camera for its size and price and meets our needs perfectly. I suspect it will probably meet the needs of most casual photographers.The quality Nikkor glass lens provides crisp and accurate images. The 14x zoom range is appropriate for most hand-held shots. The manual pop-up flash has a bit more output than most point & shoots and offers nice illumination. AA alkaline batteries are relatively long lasting (for still photos without flash) and can be purchased easily anywhere in the world. Regarding camera setup, for the vast majority of our photos, I select the AUTO setting and adjust the ISO sensitivity to 125 and simply point and shoot. The photos are very sharp with vivid color and we are pleased with the results nearly every time.For what it's worth, in reading some of the critical reviews on digital cameras, it seems the problems most people have occur in three areas: (1) battery life, (2) memory speed, and (3) user familiarity. Many seasoned photographers know that AA alkaline batteries offer the advantages of reasonably long life, affordability and availability -- especially when traveling overseas. No chargers, no voltage issues, no waiting, just plug & play. For improved performance, I use non-rechargeable Energizer Lithium AA batteries in my L610. These offer hundreds of trouble-free shots and battery life virtually becomes a non-issue (about $6 for a 4-pack on Amazon). As to memory, my choice is the SanDisk Extreme Class 10. The high-speed data transfer rate this memory card offers is particularly important when shooting videos. The current price for a 32GB card is about $30 on Amazon (a 16GB card is about half this price).As to ISO sensitivity, nearly every technical analysis of digital cameras shows image quality noticably degrades at settings above ISO 200 (ironically, similar results occur with film speeds). Unless there is a specific need, such as extremely low light or fast-action photography, lower ISO settings will give most folks much better photos under a broad range of conditions. Lastly, there is a lot of technology packed in these little automatic cameras. Obviously, we are much better off reading the camera user manual and becoming comfortable with the features and functions of these gadgets. As the saying goes, it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best point and shoot out there", "Author": "Carolina Fan", "ReviewID": "ROZQ1O5K6D0VO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an experienced SLR user who's had his own darkrooms back in the dark ages, the L610 is the camera of choice to take along everywhere. Dr. A's review is mandatory reading.Having a an excellent camera which uses AA Lithium batteries is huge advantage for virtually all of us. Even the best rechargeable batteries on high end cameras- with twice the voltage, lose ~ 10 to 15% of their power a week.  Having an excellent AA camera means never having to plug your camera into the wall and always having ~ 200 full power shots without fail.There are several very compelling reasons to choose the Nikon L 610 over it's competitors that use AA Lithium batteries, such as the the Canon PowerShot SX 160 - both of which I own- and have used extensively.The optics on both are superb. Razor sharp pictures at all focal lengths and apertures.  The Canon does have many more, user adjustable \"high end\" features than the Nikon, but the Canon SX 160 is crippled by some serious flaws.The Nikon's 3\" display is a brilliant, crystal clear 460,000 pixels versus the Canon's 230,000 pixels- which appears truly muddy and dim in comparison to the display on the L 610.The CMOS on the Nikon SX610 (which is the \"film\" on every shot) is much more sensitive in low light shots without a flash and produces noticeably brighter and sharper pics.  (Think taking pics of the baby, or a portrait with window light from your back.)The lag time between shots with the Nikon is also noticeably faster, because the Nikon has a \"set up menu\" option in it's circuitry for the type of AA you're using to select and use Lithium AAs.Recommendations on setting up the L 610, even for the novice: choose \"Auto\", not \"Easy Auto\" in the scene mode and set up your menu options THERE and leave the scene mode in \"Auto\" for virtually all of your shots.  The \"Auto\" menu also lets you turn OFF things you'll never want to use, such as the welcome screen, print date, AF assist beam, and, most of all, the killer of all clear pictures, digital zoom.Finding the PDF manual for L 160 from Nikon's site isn't easy. This may help:[...]Recommended accessories for the L610:1- Lithium 9x AA batteries from Energizer. These make the \"battery issue\" simply disappear. Two will last for well over 200 shots- yes, there is a one to two second lag time as the flash recharges. Shop for quality and expect to pay ~ $1.90 per. I've had good results from Brooklyn Battery Works and Photo Land NY.2- Memory Card- Get the best, a 16 gig San Disk Class 10 card with 45mb/Sec transfer rate. Greatly reduces lag time and this camera is set up for Class 10.  16gig capacity for ~ 2000 stills at full resolution or 32 gig if you're going to shoot movies.3- GGS 3\" Optical Glass LCD screen protector- it's the best- but this is now a real moving target on Amazon.  Make sure you get the original  from GGS in the red and black retail package.4- Camera Strap- Inexplicably, Nikon gives you a camera with two strap connection points for a \"neck strap\", which you'll want, but ships only a one point \"wrist strap\".  Solve this by ordering the slim two point neck strap that Nikon supplies for similar cameras: the Nikon AN-CP-23 strap. It's an extra $11 well spent.Search it on Amazon.5- Replacement USB cable- Confirmed by the tech staff at Mediabridge- the supplied Nikon UC-E6 cable is a Mini B with 8 pins- NOT the 5 pins found on every currently available aftermarket mini B. As of 9-03-13, the only replacement cable that works with the L 610- or any of it's Power Shot cameras- is the OEM Nikon UC-E6. Hold off buying any replacement cable for Nikon Power Shots until Mediabridge give us the right one-the mini B with 8 pins, not 5- they're working on it and they're the best.5- Camera Case- Tamrac makes the best cases- period. The Tamrac model 5292 fits the L610 perfectly and gives you room for 4 extra lithium AAs, the USB cable and extra memory cards. It's also just tall enough for you to tuck in your aftermarket Nikon neck strap.Enjoy.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera - but a few small drawbacks", "Author": "James F. Kadlec \"JFK\"", "ReviewID": "R20YK3JNE6XUNF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on the pre-release reviews the first day it was available.  I have now used it for several months, having taken vacation pictures as well as random shots, both scenic and casual shots of people.On the positive side, the camera is really well thought out, fits nicely in the hand, feels substantial and has relatively intuitive adjustments. On the negative side is it consumes batteries at a terrific rate.Since I really bought the camera for vacation, I was pleased that it would take AA alkaline batteries, however when using it with alkaline batteries it didn't take long to learn that it goes through them at a very rapid pace.  I was not getting anywhere near the number of images suggested by the reviewers.  During a busy day with a lot of shots, I would go through a set of alkaline batteries.  I just wound up buying a lot of batteries during the vacation.Since returning home, I have gone to the rechargeable NiCads and it seems to give me more images with these.  When you change battery types though, you must use the menu to reset the camera to the appropriate batteries, apparently to maximize the lifespan.  Something I don't like though, is that every time that you take out the memory card to put some pictures into your laptop or PC, the batteries fall out.  It is an annoyance.  The card itself takes some getting used to in that you really have to push it way down to get it to click into place.The zoom is very responsive............I mean very responsive.  I have no complaint about the zoom itself, but adjusting it is so sensitive that you cannot tighten up the field with people shots.  You either get them too small in the image or you cut them off.  A slower zoom would be so much better so that you can have more control.  Even though I am much more familiar with the camera now, the zoom is still way too touchy for small increments.One real complaint I do have about the camera, is that it is slow on recovery of the flash, and with the other cameras I have had, if I were trying to take a flash picture, and waiting for the flash to recover, I could hold the shutter release down and as soon as the flash had recovered, the next image would be taken immediately.  With this camera, you must release the shutter button and depress it again for the next flash picture.  Of course, this means that you are guessing when the flash has recovered before taking the next picture.The final thing is one on which I made my own mistake.  I find that having a real compact camera I can put into my pocket is very important to me.  This one is too large for that.  While this camera is quite small, it isn't small enough to put into your pocket.  It will fit into a purse, but not a pocket.  Whereas I used to carry a small pocket camera much more, because I never knew when I would get a shot, this one must be taken along when I am anticipating using it.Overall, I really like this camera and would recommend it to others.  It is a nice design, and perhaps none of what I consider as drawbacks may be important to others.  I will keep it as an adjunct camera, but I am still going to buy a different compact which will really fit into my pocket, but which has a longer zoom than my present Sony.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix L610 Camera: Solid Camera with a little Know-How", "Author": "NewsView", "ReviewID": "R7VHZDVWLHSJG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix L610 is what I would call a \"best value\" travel-zoom camera with a strong lens, a decent selection of scene modes and accurate color representation. I suspect it could use a firmware update to deal with metering/motion blur issues some users are reporting (in low light the shutter tends to slow down, resulting in camera shake or subject-motion blur). With a steady hand it takes good pictures under both bright and low light. The flash is very good in that it does not create that pinpoint glare that small camera flashes often do. The flash can also extend nearly 20', better than average. The caveat is that because the flash is a pop-up it is easy to miss the small blinking indicator suggesting that flash is necessary due to inadequate light.Short battery life is the most oft-reported consumer complaint. Sure enough, the included AA alkaline batteries died within 40 pictures; supposedly I should have been able to obtain about 120. With rechargeable batteries (3000mAh) I obtained roughly 160 photos per charge (but it could be that the rechargeable batteries were too old). The camera went from far below average to excellent once I switched to Lithium AA batteries. I took the camera on a trip with a set of lithium batteries, took some 400 photos, and returned home with the battery icon still reading fully charged (I wouldn't be surprised if I manage to get 500-600 pictures using lithium AA batteries). Changing batteries takes an otherwise poor performer and pushes it into better-than-average territory. (TIP: There is a menu setting for battery type that you must select before you change from the default alkaline type.) On a final note about the battery, I did have one incidence early on while I was still using alkaline batteries where I noticed the battery icon had gone down by half. When the LCD preview image and the lens simultaneously stuck with the batteries fully exhausted a few minutes later, I realized that a half-battery icon essentially means that it is time to change out the batteries on the spot (the icon really ought to be more specific).Image quality can range from okay (somewhat overexposed) to outstanding depending on the light, taking the time to pre-focus and the steadiness of one's hand. In general, the Nikon Coolpix L610 camera is best for still shots. Particularly impressive is the fact that the 14x zoom lens also functions at a mere 1cm for close-up macro photography. I would have no qualms recommending this camera for people who sell on Ebay as a result of its strong macro performance. The Nikon Coolpix L610 camera is also good for people (portrait shots and close-up images with flash). It serves well for landscapes, handling harsh lighting conditions very well (the 14x zoom is also travel-friendly). With a particularly steady hand or a tripod, this camera also excels in low light. (I have an Olympus SLR from some years back that does not perform nearly as well in low light as this camera in spite of a larger sensor. That being said, subject matter in low light must not be moving or there will be motion blur. If that's an issue, I recommend owners to make a regular habit of popping up the flash while indoors or outdoors at dusk/dawn.)There are tradeoffs at this price point and being a tad slow is one of them. Consequently, this camera is not the best pick for hasty snapshots of sports, kids and pets. It's not so much shutter lag at issue. The main issue for fast-action photography is the delay in writing (processing) images to the SD card (a delay that only increases when the flash needs time to recycle). The good news? Image write-speed can be significantly improved using a newer class 10 SD card of at least 30mbs of transfer speed (a faster card will also improve movie-recording).The Nikon Coolpix L610 powers up and is ready for photo taking in under 2 seconds. If, however, the camera goes into sleep mode it takes considerably longer to wake it up. Another gripe I have is that the screen will go off after a user-set amount of time but there is no way to control when the lens retracts. It will remain \"at ready\" for three minutes, even after the screen goes to sleep. I think that's a recipe for eventually knocking the lens off kilter (and perhaps why Nikon apparently gets complaints of lens errors on some of their cameras). My other digital cameras retracted the lens after about 30-45 seconds of inactivity, and the screen after about a minute. For best results, I recommend keeping this camera in a camera bag when not in use. (I also recommend replacing the hand strap because it is surprisingly thin and not up to the quality of a typical hand strap.) Similarly, like most camera LCD screens this one seems a bit more exposed without the rim around it that was common to older digital cameras. To avoid scratches and dings, it would probably be best to cover it with a screen protector. In bright light, the LCD has about average readability. (I have never found a digital camera view screen that fares well in bright sun.)The L610's menu options are easy enough to figure out without a manual, even though this is my first time owning a Nikon-brand digital camera. The ergonomics of this camera, with its gracefully curved lines, are better than average. Although the camera is a bit larger than some, the rubberized hand-grip is comfortable and the weight of the AA batteries actually helps dampen handshake. (I would say this camera is purse-size but not pocket size.) The battery compartment, like many cameras these days, is located under the same door that the SD card uses. The battery door is a bit flimsy in feel and I have my doubts that it will hold up over many years but overall the camera has a solid feel. (Like most plastic cameras, I wouldn't expect the body to survive a drop to a hard floor, however.)Operationally, AUTO mode produces inconsistent image quality compared to self-selecting the appropriate scene mode or leaving the camera in Easy mode (the default). In easy/simple mode the camera self-selects from among six of the 18 scene options. I also found that because the camera doesn't know what you intend to shoot it takes less time to focus if the multipoint AF is turned off in favor of the center-weight (single) auto focus brackets. Similarly, it is important to leave the \"motion detection\" function enabled (a green icon lights up when a subject moves).  As for image quality, I note some mild corner softening of images, particularly branches in the upper left corner. Inexplicably, sometimes something in the picture at the same distance/depth appears more crisp whereas an adjacent aspect of the picture goes noticeably softer (in landscape scene mode of a still subject where motion blur is not an issue). I also note that for sunny outdoor scenes, particularly photos with white objects/animals, it is best to use the exposure compensation, reducing exposure by about 1/3. (The nice thing about exposure compensation on this camera is that it remains locked in until you change it.)Video is recorded in HD although only digital zoom is available during filming. This does not pose a problem, in my opinion, because on cameras where optical zoom is permitted there tends to be mechanical lens noises in the audio. Movie quality is decent, although it rips through memory card space and batteries due to the 16MP/HD content. Owners should also be aware that unless one owns a newer computer with a current-generation video card, playback of HD video will be choppy if not impossible.All in all, I would say this camera is a great value for the money. The bad rap this camera has received by some may stem from the ease of forgetting to pop up the manual flash to enable a faster shutter speed when shooting indoors under poor light. The second and even more common complaint surrounds alkaline battery life. Nikon could have remedied the poor first impression by packaging the camera with lithium AA batteries for a vastly improved experience. Still, it's nice to know there are a few AA battery cameras left. No matter where one travels, AA batteries can be found in a pinch.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great overall experience", "Author": "V. Jaquery", "ReviewID": "R1D8UFN2RTWAG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you do most of your photography with DSLR & interchangeable lenses, point & shoot cameras do take some adjusting. For travel we've had different 'wafer sized' cameras...then upgraded last year to a mid-range point & shoot from another manufacturer. But programming/settings were not intuitive. In that same range, this Coolpix L610 competes well. Settings & programming are more intuitive to us and after 200 photos this camera feels right, though we're still taking it through its paces. Rechargeable batteries are a must as this is a high drain device. We purchased a kit/package that exceeded our expectations regarding quality (mini-tripod, case, rechargeable batteries/charger/European adapter, 16g SD card).", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery life for the L610", "Author": "Putt", "ReviewID": "R3UYC2Q96KWLPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Doc A. thanks for the good review. Very helpful. I looked for a point and shoot camera for my wife for quite some time, and truthfully, even with camera's costing nearly 300 dollars there was the same type of basic problems with battery life, quality, features etc. The L610 for 140 dollars had much of the upper end featured point and shoot camera's features and I believe is an excellent buy. I read one review where a lady complained about motion with blurry photo's trying to take pictures of her active children. I read Doc A comments on setting the ISO to 125, but i played with this and ultimately set it to the highest settings which nearly eliminated the blurr's and the picture still looks good to my old eyes. Normally though i set the ISO to 'Auto' and just use the 'Auto' setting like Doc A. Just point and shoot. You get a good pic everytime. IF I want to minimize the blurr's i just crank up the ISO to max and get great pic's.This brings me to my review. Battery life. I almost took this camera back as i had the same experience that many did. Put in a pair of alkaline's and i get about 20-30 pic's. Put in a pair of rechargeables and i get not a bunch more. Try to take a video of 2 minutes and the batteries are toast in an instant. It was almost unbearable. AGAIN i read Doc A's review and tried lithium batteries. The only one's they had in the store the day i went to buy were the 9x ultimate Energizers for 8.99 for 4. My report is this. I have taken 600+ hundred pictures and several short video's up to 5 minutes, several of those in addition to the 600 pic's and my batteries are still reading FULL. Every upper end point and shoot camera i looked at, being fare, i should say 90 percent of everyone i tried, required the power of a lithium type battery or equivalent. Whether it was a Canon, Sony etc people complained about the short battery life of their cameras. As the camera has less features the longer the battery lasts. No way around it. Even buying the batteries from the store shelf at 8.99 (you could get them cheaper on Amazon)is not much more than a latte if you split that in half 4.50 for two. Two batteries i have been taking these 600+ pictures for a month now with still a full reading on the battery charge using flash where needed and some short videos. My son has the smaller L26 Nikon and it will run fairly long on just a pair of alkalines, but not this camera. Buy lithium. They will last a month easily and if you don't take too many pictures they will last a few months if you take only a couple of hundred pictures per month. There are 6x lithium's cheaper even. Like between 5.99 and 6.99 for 4. I have not tried those so i cannot comment, but those will be my next try..", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great vacation pictures", "Author": "Sarah Carpenter", "ReviewID": "R4QGWUSLIJ41G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on a whim right before taking a family vacation--boy am I glad I did!  We took 890 pictures (on one set of lithium AAs)and only a very few of them are out of focus or blurry--a miracle with my overactive kids!  The flash has to be raised manually, but the camera can take excellent pictures in auto mode with very little light--very nice low light pictures compared to previous cameras I have had--so that gives you a choice.  Ocassionally the focus would set to something other than what I wanted to focus on, so it takes a little learning to use it to best effect.  I did not like the easy auto mode and didn't feel the pictures using it were great, but the regular auto mode worked well, and we took lots of great macro photos (you can't use the macro in easy auto either).  I used the beach scene setting for the beach and was very happy with it.  Great color on the shots.  I also liked that the focus was good even at full zoom, so no more blurry shots at full zoom.  There are a couple of oddities on the camera ... it would have been nice if the card was accessible without opening the battery compartment, as not only do the batteries scatter when you open it, but the battery door is bigger and harder to open and close than the little card doors.  I tried using a cord, but the cord door was also somewhat difficult and I decided I'd rather just take the card out.  You will need to buy a card separate.  There is a little recovery time when you zoom, and after using the flash, but I didn't find either to be a problem.  The screen is clear enough to tell if you have a good shot when you take it. I like the way it feels to hold as well, no slip, easy controls.  I'm very very happy with the camera and with the snapshots we got!

I'm not a fan of flat cameras.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and Amazon's delivery was prompt - as always.Update: 12/28/2013I'm not sure if the camera had dropped but I'm unable to fully close the battery compartment.Now, I have to purchase a new camera just under one year of use.

I really cannot complain, the list of features and the quality are amazing, and the price was more than fair, considering the original list price.One caveat:This does film in full HD (and it looks amazing), BUT if your computer is older or just doesn't have the right video card, it will have a problem processing the HD. In other words, I can film amazing videos in full HD and it looks great when I play it back on the camera, but when I try to watch the videos on my desktop with Win XP, the video and the audio turn out choppy and slow. I tried playing videos on my 3-year-old netbook with Win 7, same exact thing. Then I did some research and found out that it's because both my machines have older graphics cards that can't handle HD.I found out this was a pretty common problem for a lot of people.So, I'm hanging on to it, but still have to wait for that new computer eventually. Until then, I can down-convert the videos, or just film videos in lower quality (which still isn't bad quality either). All in all, it's a high-quality camera and I would recommend it to the more-than-occasional photographer.(UPDATE! 7-30-13)Well, I dropped the star level on this review, because after vacationing with this camera, the one thing that irritates me to no end is the fact that it goes through batteries like they're going out of style. It takes two AA's, and if you're filming in HD or photographing at the highest quality, you might have an hour or two (and that's pushing it!) of battery life.I wish this thing came with a rechargeable lithium battery like my older Nikon. I really don't understand why it doesn't. It seems like using standard batteries is a major step backwards for this sort of camera--especially because this camera is higher-end compared to my older Nikon. :(That said, I finally got a newer computer and the HD video does look amazing once you've got a machine that can process it.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Poor Quality", "Author": "Mr. M", "ReviewID": "R27FMRBS3KZX74", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had to return.

The features and ease of use are outstanding but I need a camera I can count on to take a quality picture every time.  I take pictures at group events on a regular basis. The picture quality is poor and blurry pictures are the norm.  I called nikon for help and they told me to use the auto mode, not the easy auto mode and put the ISO to 150, that did not help.  Than I took pictures with my old SonyCyber Shot, my wife's Canon PowerShot SD1200IS, and a Fuji FinePix 4.1 mp and put them into iphoto for comparisons.  Needless to say my old Sony was the best followed by the PowerShot, FinePix, and finally the L610 which was a distant last.

Schmuland \"Arlene S\"", "ReviewID": "R3R4TNTKXSXCNM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the camera for several months and I keep the camera with me more so than perhaps most people would (I live in AK, you never know when you're going to see a moose or some other wonderful wildlife.) It's almost always in my shoulderbag and I'm not particularly protective of it--the screen has a few scratches/cracks and that's because I don't keep it in a case but just let it rattle around in the bottom of my bag. The quality of images is excellent for size & price point. It's not significantly bigger than the other point & shoots I've had and the quality definitely makes up for the size difference. It's easy to use. The 14x zoom is really nice for the size/price of the camera. However the differential in the zoom speed is weird--it goes fast (really touchy, I see others have said this) up to about 3/4 of the way and then it moves extremely slow--it even stops at that 3/4 point and you have to keep holding the zoom to get it to go further, even when it appears to no longer be zooming in. Since I'm not always looking at the details of the display as opposed to what I'm trying to view through the display, I haven't always taken the zoom in as far as I would have preferred. Battery life got a whole lot longer when I picked up some Sony rechargeable high capacity batteries--a considerable difference from the alkaline, in my view. However, transferring the photos to my laptop has proven challenging. Using the USB cable simply does not work. My Mac does not recognize that anything is on the other end of that cable, no matter what I do. So I have to pull out the card and plug it into the slot on the Mac. This isn't a huge challenge normally (it even further extends battery life if I'm transferring direct from card rather than cable) but what I've run into is because I've so consistently opened the battery cover door, more so than would be required for battery replacement, the closures/locks on the battery cover have now given way. I can close the door and lock it if I have no batteries in, but if the batteries are in, the pressure they put on the door makes it spring open. Since it's nearly impossible to keep steady hands while keeping pressure on the battery compartment door, I've had to tape it shut and then tape/retape as I want to transfer photos. Judging by some of the other reviews, this is happening to more than a few of us and Nikon should be considering this as a defect of the engineering, not ours to fix.To sum up: great quality pics and zoom for size/price of camera. It's a point & shoot, don't expect a professional level camera. Battery door is a giant pain so if you decide to go with this one make sure you a) get high capacity rechargeable batteries and can b) transfer images via cable as much as possible so you don't wear out the door connections as quickly as I did. If it helps, I am looking at replacing it with the same exact model since I really like how it photographs over any other point & shoot I've had, but I'll be changing some of my behavior with the next one.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "L.

The other primary reason was to have a small portable unit with Full HD (high definition) 1080p video capability. I had looked at many models, including other brands, and almost went with the Nikon COOLPIX P510 due to the extra zoom power, but decided on the L610 as a smaller size for increased portability (i.e., I can wear it on my belt in a pouch or in a jacket pocket) was the deciding factor.The amount of technology built in to these small cameras is amazing and the quality of the of L610 images is typical Nikon, excellent in pretty much all cases, with sharp, and colorful output. With 16MP at full resolution, enlargements look fantastic. I do have a 16x20 canvas print hanging in my house from my L610. One must keep in mind that in an \"extremely\" low light setting and when zooming the aperture will likely be at the f/5.8 range and results may not be that great. However, when not zoomed, or zoomed very little, and nearer f/3.1, the quality is very good.There are setting and mode selections for virtually any type of photography, such as museums (quiet no click, no flash), portraits, close-up, landscape and others, and all of them deliver very high quality images. Nikon's optical VR (Vibration Reduction) image stabilizing feature works pretty much as well as with my DSLRs meaning that a slight camera shake should not ruin a photo. As a note, the Auto setting works extremely well in most circumstances.I use Non-rechargeable Energizer Advanced Lithium AA Batteries and while I have never really counted the number of shots I get, I would estimate, with and without flash, at least 400-500, maybe more. A SanDisk Extreme 16 GB SDHC Class 10 card provides up to 2,000 full resolution still images. For video mode, a 32GB would be best.For my purposes, as outlined above, I have never been disappointed and definitely recommend this point and shoot Nikon offering.

For $150 you get a very useful 14x zoom and a clear 16 megapixels. It takes great shots outside and inside it has decent low light performance. The flash is very good as well. It is nicely sized for being a megazoom camera. Unfortunately, the battery life is hysterically low and you can only take a short video or about 60 pictures on alkaline battery's. I recommend rechargeables. Also, I have had a small issue with the shutter flaps. Occasionally it only opens part way. Also, the camera doesn't like to focus on close up low light conditions.

There are many easy selections on the digital screen for indoor, outdoor, bright sun, low light and many other conditions. The camera fits easily in your hand and is light weight. Pictures come out beautiful and transferring them to your computer and/printer is simple via the enclose USB cable. There is also a cable provided for non-USB connection to older equipment.Now for the bad news. This camera uses up standard AA batteries so fast that I will be getting rechargeable batteries for this camera. Definitely purchase a case that can hold the camera and extra batteries.Also, the camera does not come with a memory card so order it at the same time as the camera. Otherwise you'll only get about 5-8 photo images or 2 panaramic images before you'll need to export them in order to capture more. There are excellent deals available on Amazon for memory cards. I got 64GB for under $35.All things considered, I love this camera (It's that good) and have chosen to keep it because of its versatility, image quality and light weight.

The Nikon L610 is the first digital I have owned that feels like a more substantial SLR when holding it.  Today, most digital cameras are not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes, and thinner.  They are awkward to hold, and if your hands are bigger than medium size, the challenge to keep fingers off of unwanted feature buttons can be daunting.  The L610 has what I will call a vertical 'bulge' on the right side, which is perfect for your grip.  The shape of the top of the camera is, on first look, very unusual, and then you recognize that it provides some additional ergonomics that make your left hand grip better, and which keeps those errant fingers above the lens, and away from the viewing screen. And when you deploy the flash, the left hand still remains clear.  The viewing screen is a terrific 3\" wide, which doesn't seem like much, until you compose your photo on it.  It is BIG.  The top of the camera is super user friendly.  The power button is in a perfect location, the shutter is easily found without looking for it every time you take a shot, and the zoom control (part of the shutter assembly) is also 'intuitive'.Menu features are very simple to use, even if you don't bother to read any of the instructions that come with the camera.  I have not used the movie feature extensively yet, so I have some learning to catch up on with respect to the sound recording level adjustments.  However, the video was simple to use, and playback likewise was intuitive.  By the way, we shot inside with available light, and the quality of the video was excellent!  We really didn't take the time to do a decent test of the sound level, but what we did record was clear.The package comes with a USB cable, and a video cable, a camera strap, and two AA batteries.  There are plenty of accessories available, but I limited myself to a 16 GB SDHC card, a Case Logic camera case, and a set of four rechargeable batteries with charger.  The price of the camera, plus the noted accessories was a total of nine dollars more than the lowest price for just the camera that I found anywhere else.One final note:  Nikon engineers have a home run with this camera.  The ergonomics are first rate - for you Industrial Engineers out there, this model is a case study in human factors engineering.  For the rest of us, this camera is at the perfect price point for new digital camera users, and is a welcome high quality addition to the more seasoned user's camera bag.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery eater", "Author": "Amazon Buyer", "ReviewID": "R15LG9GFT4DEPT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Beware.

I had just ruined my Sony W-170 camera after falling into Tensleep Creek (Wyoming) with it.  I'm not made of money, so, after reading numerous reviews, comparing features and prices, I settled with the Nikon L610.  VERY PLEASED.  I bought a bundle with camera, case, memory card, batteries, tripod, strap, and I forget what else.I was concerned with battery life, so I purchased 12 Energizer Ultimate Lithium 9x batteries.  Took nearly 200 photos with no battery issues, or, for that matter, no issues at all.  The ONLY thing that I dislike is its seemingly long (1-2 seconds?) lapse to focus after using the telephoto.  No big deal.  The photos are crystal clear, colors are spot on.  And...it is easy to use.  I just use Auto Mode and set  the ISO to 200.  Works for me!!Bottom line: If you want a reasonably priced camera that is easy to use and delivers great photos, look no further.  Just be sure to buy the better batteries.  So far, I have still the original two batteries in the unit.  I put it into service in late August 2013.Update:  It is now April 19, 2014....I still have the original 2 Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries in this unit.  This morning, they went dead, after taking 3 pictures.  So....I don't think that is bad at all for battery/camera performance.  8 months of use.

For this particular camera, I was looking fo something more simple (since I have a D-SLR now), but still takes crisp photos.  So far, I've been somewhat disappointed in the ease-of-use factor for this camera.  For example, you must pop up the flash for it to work, even when setting the flash to \"auto\" on the easy setting.  Where is the automation there??  I like that the flash is not built into the body (does a better job that way), but really, how hard can it be to automate it to pop up when I set it as such?  And it also seemed to take a long time for the flash to re-cycle.  As in several seconds (on fresh batteries), so I was also disappointed there.  But as for image quality, it does deliver on that point.  Even in lower light, the images have nice clarity (when you keep the ISO set to 200 or lower especially).  The overall feature set is somewhat limited, and there isn't much in the way of manual controls, but then again, that isn't what I was after when I bought this (that's why you need a D-SLR).  I'm using Lithium batteries for this, as recommended by others, and so far I'm still on my first set of those after more than 150 pictures and some video.  Speaking of the video, I haven't done much shooting with that yet, so the jusy is still out on that quality.To further update, as was the case with my original Coolpix, the battery door stop latching after a minor drop (I really mean minor... about a 2 foot drop onto a tile floor).  I suppose it hit the right spot with the wrong force to break whatever little tab holds the door closed.  Now the Scotch Tape latch must be used, as because Nikon wouldn't fix it for free (they wanted $80 or $90 to fix it, and I only paid $130).  So I was pretty disappointed, and now have learned not to buy Nikon compact cameras anymore.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "TONI FERNANDEZ", "ReviewID": "R1GK3YVXQ6094T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow the pixels are great.

It's a great, quality little camera I really enjoy. The pictures and video are 1080p HD, very sharp, and the camera has both HDMI and A/V output. It's very easy to use, it only took me five minutes to learn all the ins and outs. The flash pops up manually, which I like, because it prevents the flash from going off when you don't want it too. Nikon is a quality brand, and I can see the quality of this camera. The 14x optical zoom is great for a camera of this size. It moves fast and is very clear all the way zoomed out. I like that it runs on AA batteries, no charger to keep up with, and if you like taking pictures hiking outside you can always bring batteries with you, but  you can't bring outlets with you.Some have mentioned that it drains batteries, but if you get a good pack of lithium Rayovac AAs you should be fine. Just be sure to change the battery setting from alkaline to lithium. Overall, this is a great camera for the casual photographer or for vacations and events. I bought mine from Cameta Camera for $67 Nikon Factory Refurbished with free shipping. They sell here on Amazon and also on eBay. I saw this camera in Target originally, and it was $250.

I purchased this camera,(unfortunately for the Nikon name) from Target, 9 months in advance of my daughters championship solo dance so that I could learn how to use it and which settings to use for the appropriate situations. I didn't want to overuse it as it was dedicated especially for this one time performance, but I learned everything about it and knew how to use it..On the actual day I prepared the correct settings and put brand new lithium batteries in the compartment. When her music started I turned on the camera (not sooner to prevent draining the batteries), and to my horror it kept shutting off. The dance started as I was madly slamming in new batteries. After less than 30 seconds of filming (with the 2nd set of batteries) I got the \"battery exhausted\" message. The performance was over, never to be done again. Not only do I not have a keepsake video, I didn't even get to watch her perform due to messing with this darn camera. To add insult to injury I tried to take some photos of her and her team mates after the show. Every photo but one, was blurry.

If you take 10 pictures in a row your battery will be dead.  It isn't that the battery is totally depleted, so much as it draws to much power at a time.  If you take a picture here and a picture there throughout the day you will be fine, but who buys a 250 dollar camera for that?-Time between pictures is terrible as well - At best you can take a picture every 12 seconds, it takes that long for it to recover after shooting one off.-Shutter speed depends solely on the flash being open or closed.  With the flash closed you shouldn't even try to take photos of close things that are even slowly walking around, they will be blurry.  Opening the flash helps, but the flash always goes off.  There is no way to take a close up picture in the bright light with the flash closed without it being blurry.

I had an older coolpix but when I let my daughter borrow it, she broke the battery door when she fell on it ice skating.The camera is pretty easy to use, takes really clear pictures that you can blow up without my distortion. Nice contrast and pretty good color too. The zoom is 14x but when you zoom past the optical zoom section, its a digital zoom meaning it will just enlarge the image taking a pretty crappy picture. The image stabilizer works great except when the winds blowing! I'm used to a full sized camera, so using this tiny thing in the wind is impossible for me.I use this camera when I go hiking and its perfect for that! I used to take my regular camera (Nikon D300) with lenses, tripod, flash etc and by time I hiked to my destination, I'm too tired to take any pictures. Switching to the coolpix is the perfect solution. Fact that it uses AA batteries means I can shoot all day without draining the batteries. I carry 8 AA in my camera pouch for my longer hikes.I love taking video with this camera too. I carry a gopro and my Nikon and find that the Nikon's video is 100x sharper then the gopros! The image stabilizer makes my videos nice and steady, not shaky like the gopro.now for the negatives:Battery life is terrible!! This camera is great for taking pictures, the batteries last long long time but if you shoot video with it, make sure you invest in a giant pack of AA batteries!! This camera will drain a pair of new AA batteries in less then 10 minutes of shooting!! BUT, the batteries aren't fully dead, the camera I think overheats them (they are hot when you take them out) and the fail, Swap them out, let them cool down and you can get a few more minutes of video out of them.Video: When I shoot video and I'm doing a longer shot, the camera will have a frame thats half black. You can see when it happens thru the screen. When you edit the footage, you'll have to chop that frame out. Sometimes its noticeable, sometimes not.. And when you're filming and zoom in, its NOT an optical zoom! Its a digital zoom meaning the image is just enlarged via software so it gets grainy pretty quickly. And you can't cant zoom very far in either and it doesnt zoom very fast. Another problem is you can't zoom in, film then zoom out (shoot from long shot to wide angle).overall its a wonderful camera exceeding my expectations and would gladly buy it again.
