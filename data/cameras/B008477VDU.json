Poor Accessories", "Author": "yousuf", "ReviewID": "R2F8EK7CFSMW1F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The whole package was delivered on time as notified at the time of purchase. It also had all the accessories neatly packed. However, only the camera, 18-55mm and 75-300mm, spare battery are canon owned products. Rest accessories were NOT! The bag is noticeably small and can only hold camera and 18-55 mm lens. The wide angle and 2X lens are not CANON products either. This was very disappointing for me. Although, all the products are brand new and work flawlessly. The deal would've been sweeter if the rest accessories were cannon made too.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great starter kit...Bigger bag would be useful.", "Author": "jeffi7d2", "ReviewID": "R2KKOVCTOLLY6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although all the products in this package are NOT Canon products the overall quality is great.  Everything came as advertised and was very neatly packed in the box I received.  The only issue I had (more like a suggestion or thought) was that the bag that came with it is not big enough for all the pieces included in this package.  Maybe a future upgrade in bag sizes available for this package is in the works.  Yet overall the accessories bag still allows you to carry around the basics.  Did like that it came with an extra battery and charger (car charger is a great thing to have on a camping trip where elertrical outlets are not readily available).  From a cost standpoint though this package is a great starter kit for that photographer in your life.  I know my daughter will be enjoying this gift for years to come.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal and quality", "Author": "David S.

My kids are tired of picture taking but I am just getting started..lolThe only thing I wpu;d add to make this bundle even better would be a photo editing software bundled with it (  but I just got one so I am now good :)  )If you are on the fence I would WHOLEHEARTEDLY say take the jump.

I love this camera and the 70/300 MM lens. The travel charger box and contents were not the same, but 1 phone call and 3 days had the correct one at my door. I have used everything that came with the package. It is really nice to have two batteries and chargers. I had never used a card reader but it is so much faster and easier than plugging in the camera. If you buy this don't buy it for the camera bag (it is way too small I'm using my old one). And I just can not trust either of the tripods especialy with the 300mm lens (I'm using my old one). For the price this was the best deal I could find. And the service was great. My suggestion would be to lose the tripods and up grade the bag!

I got the whole package beacuse I could afford the reasonable price and it came with a lot of extras that come handy while traveling. Obviously, this is a big step up from my Canon A700 point-n-shoot in terms of picture quality, shooting modes and the flash that makes night-shots very clear. I loved the fact that it came with an extra battery pack and an USB adapter for direct read from the memory card.I am not an expert photographer, but the kind of shots I got so far tells me I may not buy another one in a long time!

Was very pleased with everything that came with camera. Easy to use and came with great book on different ways to take pictures. Easy to understand. Amazon was great on letting me know step by step from time of order till delivery were my camera was. The company did a great job on getting my order right, packing it, and getting it to me before delivery date. I will order from that company again. The only problem I had was with UPS. I left a note on the door to take packages to another location if I was not at home. You guessed it when I came home the box was sitting infront of the door with the note on it. It was left out in the open with no protection and were anyone could see it from the road.
