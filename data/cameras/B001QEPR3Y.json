To be honest, at first I was disappointed. It turned out to be a lot bigger (thicker) than I expected, which was just error on my part for not clarifying dimensions. The user interface is very elementary and I felt like I didn't have a lot of control. Then, the way that the screen displays the images-it was rather mediocre. There didn't seem to be anything special (well, that is, 10.1 MP special) about them.Anyway, I decided that it was such a great deal that I could deal with these quirks. I'm so glad I decided to stick with it! Once the photos were uploaded, they looked INCREDIBLE!!! I couldn't believe that I took them (I wasn't even trying to pay attention at quality, and a lot of the pictures were taken when I wasn't actually sober...).I don't really use the Best Shots, but the camera pretty much does all the work for me. So, yeah--if you're looking for an easy, straightforward, inexpensive (you wouldn't believe how much research I did on inexpensive digital cameras.. this one is by far the best value), digital camera, this is a great choice!", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "LayedBackGuy", "ReviewID": "R5649RXAL7B3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera, so I don't have any other to compare it to; but I have used film type off and on for many years, including some semi-pro SLR types my ex-lady owned.  Right out of the box, using quick start/dummy settings, this one took some impressive pictures!  I have yet to mess around with some of the more advanced manual and auto settings, but I can see already this camera is a great deal for the price.  Picture quality and ease of use are outstanding!  My only complaints so far; the buttons are a bit small, and I have had to back track through the menu a few times to make up for my thick fingers, and I can tell already the lens assembly is a bit delicate...watch your fingers when the camera is on!  Also, I would recommend buying a case to go with; though this is a 'stick it in your pocket' size camera, it looks like the lens and LCD screen will not hold up to that sort of treatment in the long run.Casio Exilim EX-Z29 10.1 MP Digital Camera with  3x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Purple)", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's a camera.

For $70 bucks I guess it's worth it to have a camera that you can just throw in your pocket and use for snapshots. In low light your gonna get allot of \"redeye\" because the flash is so close to the lens. Outside in well lit area i.e. daytime the camera works good. It's also very slow between shots (must be the processor) again I'm used to cameras that can take several shots a second.Bottom line: If you want a basic camera to take ok snapshots and you can get this camera on sale for $70.00 I'd say it's a good buy. If you want more speed and better pictures in low light look somewhere else.UPDATE: 5/28/10  My son dropped the camera into the dogs water bowl that was full. The camera was submerged for 10-20 seconds. Without turning the camera on I removed the battery and the memory card and let the camera dry for twelve hours. The camera works fine.UPDATE: 6/24/10I've owned this camera for two months now and It's just a piece of crap. Theres no better way to put it. Whites are too easily washed out. Redeye is awful, and the time it takes the camera to process the pictures in between shots is forever. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.UPDATE: 2/26/11The Camera has been sitting on a shelf for months now.

I was a bit sceptic about the CASIO brand for a camera, a CASIO for me is a watch... As a photo enthusiast for more than 30 years I owned Olympus, Nikon, Pentax, Minolta, Canon, Sony, Kodak and even a Polaroid camera. I figured, since when I switched from using 35mm cameras to digital, the life expectance of those is an average 2 years. Because they are so handy to be always carried around you drop them, you loose them, they got pickpocket in a crowd at a concert, wet up while I'm sailing or they just die the magic electronic or fine mechanic death. The very same CASIO EX-Z9 actually only lasted for four month.... it got stolen in a break in our apartment... Ok, back to the subject, in those 4 month we had this camera it impressed me compared to it's price, with the excellent quality of the pics it took, nice zoom, powerful little flash, easy to use menus, the sturdiness of the housing made more from metal than plastic, it's small size easily fitting in a shirt pocket, it came with a rechargeable lithium ion battery and travel charger and it's cool look (it wasn't pink...). As a replacement I got for my wife last year on a Amazon Gold Box Deal for the same $89.-- a Nikon Coolpix L20, 10 megapixel, at that time I couldn't find a CASIO in that price class and the Nikon was rated in more than a 100 reviews with an average 4 stars. It turned to be out bigger and heavier than the CASIO, didn't came with rechargeable batteries, has an all plastic housing and I noticed the picture output on crisp shots, specially with flash use was far higher with the CASIO in auto mode than with the Nikon.I myself own a bigger and more professional Canon PowerShot G10 and now put the Amazon Gold Box offer for $69.-- for the CASIO EX-Z29 despite it's pink in my shopping basket, so I have a nice little camera to carry around all the time...... just will have to hide it away from my wife....!", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "For the kids, maybe.

After using it for two months, I have to say that I'm disappointed with the pictures.  Colors just aren't vibrant, nor are they particularly accurate.  The time between red-eye flash and real flash is way too long, and it's so bright that most subjects think it's the main flash and move before the picture snaps.  I've had to retake so many pictures because of this.  Videos are poor quality, very grainy and low frame rate.  Like other cameras in its class, the battery has to be charged in a separate charger instead of simply plugging a power cord into the camera.On the plus side, it's easy to use.  It has the usual presets which can be selected by scrolling through sample scenes.  You just pick the scene that's similar to the one you're taking.I also have a Fuji Finepix J20 for comparison.  Picture and video quality of the Exilim is markedly inferior to the Fuji.  Although the Exilim is $50 cheaper, the savings isn't worth it.

I find with this one, however, that pictures are very often out of focus. I have not had that problem in the past. Oh, once in a while something would be out of focus, but not as frequently as with this one. I bought this camera for a graduation gift. It will do. However, the very first two of these {7MP and 8MP} I had were equipped with a feature that allowed it to stay on the scene mode you had chosen when you last powered it off. With these newer cameras they \"fixed\" that so that now, each time you power the camera on you have to remember to switch the scene mode or you will get lousy pictures.

(I briefly considered buying a clamp.)2) There is no way to monitor the camera on my computer, which meant that even if #1 wasn't true, I would have to guess where I was in the frame.I took it back to the store where I bought it (which, for some reason, only offered it in an embarrassing shade of magenta.)I have no problem with the quality of the pictures, but surely I'm not the only person out there who wants to take pictures of themselves! It has a youtube video feature, but this is also useless to me without being able to monitor myself.I know enough about technology to know it couldn't possibly increase the cost of this product much to put basic, no-brainer features that allow you to control your camera from your computer.A shame.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10.1-megapixel resolution for high-quality prints\n3x optical zoom; 2.7-inch LCD screen\nYouTube Capture Mode\nFace Detection; Best Shot Mode\n17.8 MB built-in flash memory; compatible with SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-Z29 10.1 MP Digital Camera with  3x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Purple)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sqnlm6W-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001QEPR3Y"}}
