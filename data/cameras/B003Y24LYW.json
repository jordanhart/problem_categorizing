I am really not sure I could do my job without it. The battery life is great, and it is light enough to carry around from one place to another. I subtracted one start because it frequently turns on by itself while it is in my bag. I arrived at a job site once, and it was dead. The power button should have a shield over it, or just be a little harder to press. Other than that it is a great piece of equipment.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great battery life", "Author": "Gary Pansino", "ReviewID": "R31X4BD5COQDK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A one of a kind product that is rugged and works great.
