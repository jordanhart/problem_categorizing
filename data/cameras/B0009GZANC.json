But it isn't my first SLR ... I have used a Canon Elan IIE for a number of years, and trust me, that camera is no slouch.But enough about me ... the D50 is the real star of the show!  I have had the camera (along with the standard lens included with the kit) and so far I am extremely happy.  I purchased it just in time to capture some photos of my new neice, and my family swears that the pictures that I was just casually snapping at the hospital look like they are professional portaits.  Granted, some of my family members ... well, their necks are pretty tan, if you know what I mean, but you get the point.  The camera has a slew of modes that are ideally suited to your subject (portraits, action, etc etc), and they do a great job of making all of the fine adjustments that improve the overall quality of the photo for the non-experts.  But this camera has varying levels of automation to where you would practically require a photography degree to get your picture.  My skills are somewhere in between, but trust me, if you are an absolutely beginner, in 5 minutes you can be taking photos that are 99% of the quality that a pro with a $5000 setup would take.  Now you might need to snap a few dozen shots to get just one that is amazing, but that is what is just wonderful about digital cameras.  And with a huge, super sharp LCD preview window, you can see in an instant if you have a decent shot, and if not, delete it and try again!The camera takes the small \"big-toenail\" SD memory cards, which is a departure from what you will typically see in a digital SLR.  I personally like the smaller size; otherwise, I don't believe there is a significant difference.  If you pick up one major point from this review ... READ THIS !!!!  I initially tried shooting with some SD memory that I had been using in my MP3 player.  It worked fine, but if shooting a series of rapid shots, it would take the camera what seemed like a couple of seconds to write to the memory.  That is typical with all of the digital SLRs that I have read about ... you get maybe a dozen high-speed shots, and then the camera sort of \"bogs down\".  And most of the time that is fine.  But this camera takes advantage of the slightly more expensive \"pro\" SD memory, which can be written to at extremely high speeds.  Because of this, the camera can take an unprecendented number of shots (I believe 137 according to Nikon)!!!  Folks, that is amazing, let me tell you.  You can just hold the button down and fire away, and capture all of the high-speed action that you can imagine.  No more excuses for missing that perfect action shot.  Sure, you aren't going to require this feature very often, but it is nice to have, just in case.  And even with normal shots, the high-speed memory seems to work much quicker than normal memory.The camera can save files in three different size (resolution) levels, three different JPEG quality levels, and the complete uncompressed RAW format.  I've been shooting using the medium resolution and medium JPEG quality, and the photos look sharper than my old Canon 35mm SLR.  You could easily print out 8 x 10 photos and they would look perfect even at the medium quality setting; poster size would look fine at the high quality setting.The rechargeable battery that is included is simply amazing - I believe they rate it for 2000 shots, and I believe it.  It would be VERY diffult to drain this battery in a single day, even with numerous flashes and auto-focusing shots.The fast auto-focus, very user-friendly menus, flexibility with all Nikon lenses, and near-pro quality at a price that the weekend-photo-warrior consumer can afford, I don't see how you can go wrong with this camera.Happy photographing!", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "Finally a digital camera I can love!", "Author": "L. MURRAY \"Pleased to share my observations!\"", "ReviewID": "R1ICR02MJJQUQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera feels so much like my old Nikon film camera, it was love from the first moment I held it in my hand.  Using a 1 Gig memory card I can now shoot 350+ \"fine\" quality photos without having to change out ten rolls of film...or pay the processing! And a handy battery recharger quickly restores battery capacity when needed. Even with lots of flash pictures its charge remained strong for very long periods of time. A handy icon appears in the info screen area to let you see at a glance who much power remains.I bought the D50 for a vacation to the photogenic Southwest, and this camera was more than up to the task. The fast auto-focus, the simplfied auto controls that give quick choices for portrait, landscape and full sun, cloudy, night etc. let me shoot like a pro while it was the Nikon that converted my impulses into reality. Neat.With the ability to interchange lenses, and a great Nikon Zoom lens to start, I believe this camera proves that it is the optics which are every bit as important as the pixels. My earlier digital camera has suffered sudden retirement.I have a wide carriage Epson printer and have been printing out some of the images as 12x18 prints. Even with cropping, the images look like they were taken with a medium format camera. Progress!If you like crisp and detailed images with no hint of digital-itis, this camera is a great choice. I love precisely composing pictures through the lens rather than approximating the cropping with the display screen; but I also benefit from the ability to quickly check that screen to see the results at once. Never could do that with my old SLR without a Polaroid back!Overall, this camera and lens is a real find and I do not think you can go wrong with it. Its only drawback is a short learning curve to become familiar with the many features and options it includes, and that is not really a complaint. This camera has more tricks than I will ever use!", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "The N50 is an Outstanding Entry-Level D-SLR", "Author": "JMAC \"JMAC\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z5DEZ7NYVNEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used Canon and Nikon film cameras for more than 20 years (love my N55 and still use an AE1-P) and own other Canon and Nikon digitals but this was my first D-SLR.  I scoured magazine and online reviews and the choice came down to the Canon EOS Rebel XT and the Nikon D70.They are very similar.  The EOS is 8.0 MP vs. the D70's 6.1 MP but for the type of photography I will be doing (max 11x14 prints) that is not a problem.  The D70 has quite a few more control features.  That and the price difference tipped me towards the Nikon.Once I made up my mind to buy a Nikon, I compared the D70 to the D50.  They are quite similar and in some ways the D50 is superior to the more expensive D70.  Besides a more rugged body, the D70 has a few nice features the D50 lacks: a lighted control panel, a front sub-control thumbwheel, depth of field preview, and you can fine-tune white balance.  But the D50 has some features over the D70, notable a larger LCD monitor, higher capacity battery, and USB 2.0 high speed support.  Every magazine I read raved about the D50 and none of the features it lacked made me willing to pay more for the D70.  I purchased the D50 with the Nikkor AF-S DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G Zoom Lens.After using it for several weeks all I can say is, wow!  It is easy to use but I can fiddle with nearly all settings when I want to get creative.  Using a digital with almost no shutter lag has spoiled me.  I've taken many great shots with a Canon PowerShot 1S IS but it's my backup now.  In the D50 I have finally found an affordable digital camera that is as fun to use as my film cameras.Pros will probably prefer higher-end Nikons but if you like using film SLRs and would like to get into a D-SLR for less than the price of a decent used car, I highly recommend the D50.June 2006 update: I recently used my D-50 to photograph friends doing a triathlon to raise money for cancer research.  It performed flawlessly in all settings and I ended up with many outstanding photos.  The triathlon gave me ample opportunities to use the D-50's \"sports\" setting and continuous exposure feature to capture athletes swimming, bicycling, and running from a variety of distances.  The colors are perfect and I was able to get 5x7 and 8x10 prints on photo paper (from a lab) with hardly a tweak beyond cropping.  The D-50 is now my favorite camera.  Yes, there are cameras with higher resolution and more features but it is hard to beat the \"bang for the buck\" factor on the D-50.One suggestion: like every other camera manual I have ever read, the Nikon manual that comes with the D-50 is accurate and complete but leaves a lot to be desired.  Unless you are so experienced that you do not have to read a manual (and I'm not) I highly recommend you invest in a copy \"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon D50\" by Simon Stafford.  This book is everything the Nikon manual is not.  This Magic Lantern Guide not only thoroughly explains every feature on the D-50 but goes beyond to illustrate how, when, and why you would use a setting or feature.  It also throws in tips & tricks that Nikon's writers wouldn't include.

Gong", "ReviewID": "RDEM2IMPGBWQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic camera and I'm having a load of fun shooting with it.  If you want a real short review...solid body, amazing low light performance, get the 18-70 mm lens, shoot away and have fun!Here is the long version:A little photographic background about myself first.  I'm what you'd call an amatuar enthusiast.  My dad gave me Canon A-1 (35 mm SLR from the early 80's) to play with when I was in middle school. I still have and it still works great.  I use it occasionally now when I need the telephoto lens it has.  My first digital camera was an Apple Quicktake 100, a pioneering product, but not much real use.  I bought a Canon S30 in 2002, wonderful little camera took great pictures and can take a lot of abuse, when I moved to a Canon A95 last year, the S30 was passed to my mom.  In general, I can't say any bad things about all the Canon's I have owned, except the A95 costed me a bit in batteries.  The S30 and the A95 took great photos and are tough cameras.Anyway, back  to the D50.  It's my first Nikon, actually it's my family's first Nikon.  It's also the most anyone has ever spent on a camera in my family (although what my dad spent on the A1 in 1982 dollars probably came close to this).  I got it primarily because I wanted to shoot in darker settings and need longer zoom than my A95 can provide.  I was seriously considering the Canon 350D.  I knew it would be a good camera because of my past experience with Canon.  But but in the end I decided to get the D50 instead on the grounds that the Nikon D50 body is better built and more pleasant to shoot with and has better noise performance at high ISO.  I also had a slight 'grass is greener on the other side of the fence' itch...in any case, after two weeks, I'm not disappointed with the D50.  Actually I'm pretty thrilled!Here is my experience with the camera.  First of all, the camera feels great in my hand.  I feel like 'photographer' when I'm shooting with it.  The balance with the 18-70 mm nikkor f3.5-4.5 lens is good.  The camera doesn't feel tender or too plasticky.  It begs to be held.Secondly, the low light performance of the camera is absolutely amazing. The camera has very low noise at ISO 800 and I use that setting on a regular basis.  At ISO 1600, the noise does increase a bit but the photos are still usable.  There is a work around where you can get the ISO 1600+ performance but the ISO 800 noise level.  Simply use +5 exposure compensation with ISO 800 in shutter priority mode.  Compare to a campact digicam, the difference in quality is night and day.  I very rarely use flash now.  That said, the built-in flash is not bad!  Pretty uniform illumination with good range.Thirdly, the auto focusing does a very good job and pretty fast.  I rarely use the AF assistance lamp.  I turn it off unless I'm in an unlit room.  The AF will have problems focusing on uniform background but that's understandable.The last thing I want to mention is that the battery life is excellent.  I have yet to drain the battery in one day yet.  Turning off the AF assist lamp, use less flash and turn off the sound all helps with battery life.  There are many other features of the camera that I haven't really played much yet...WB, sharping, saturation and etc., the auto mode on those parameters seem to do a fine job.Here are my recommendations if you want to get this camera.  First, I'd forgo the 18-55 mm kit lens, get the body only and the 18-70 mm lens (normally part of the D70/D70s kit).  You'll appreciate that extra 15 mm often.  Second, get a fast 1 GB or more SD card.  A 1 GB card gives me about 270-300 photos at best JPG setting.  Third, get a nice camera bag like something by Lowepro.  It'll protect your camera and allow you to take it to many places that you won't take the camera to had you not had the camera bag.  Fourth, get a UV filter with the lens from the get go.  They say B+W is good, I got their MRC filter and now I'm worry free.  Lastly, send in your lens warranty card right after you get your lens!  If you don't you are giving away a 5 year warranty and it becomes a 1 year warranty.  My next purchase would be a nikkor 80-200 mm F2.8 zoom lens but that'll have to wait till I replenish my bank account somewhat.In summary, this is a great camera for serious amatuars upgrading to their first dSLR.

Hamm \"p-squared\"", "ReviewID": "R3UJJ2PGS6W45J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera takes great pictures... period. I bought it to use with the 18-200 VR lens from Nikon, and it is awesome. Some (like Ken Rockwell) insist that you should skip the RAW mode and just use JPEG (Ken even says to use Normal JPEG rather than fine). I couldn't disagree more. (although I LOVE Ken's reviews and think you all should read them before buying ANYTHING! Google Ken Rockwell and check it out.)My tests showed that the quality difference between RAW and FINE Jpeg are noticeable, but subtle... so... buy some big old 1G cards. But then again... if you're going on vacation and can't bring a computer, don't fret... shoot at FINE Jpeg, and you'll be happy as can be.The scene modes might be handy for the total amateur (that's NOT a bad thing, btw) but I don't use them, and the flexible program mode is so useful you may want to even skip the Aperture and Shutter Priority modes (although I like both from time to time so go figure...). Manual is manual ( I like it a lot, but I used to use purely manual cameras and I liked it, so there you go...) and the on-camera flash is uneven (I'm getting set to order an SB600) and inadequate. For simple snapshots, it's okay, but it tends to wash out your colors. For fill flash outdoors, it can work pretty great. Red Eye is EXTREME on a flash like this by the way.The lack of depth of field preview, white balance fine-tuning, and wireless control are most of what distinguishes this from a D70. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, buy a D50 and forget about it. I know what they're for (I've used quite a bit of pro gear from Nikon and Canon), and I STILL don't miss them. (The DOF preview... yeah, I miss it a little, but being able to view my photo on the excellent LCD makes up for it.Here's the bottom line. If you can afford a D70 and a decent lens (or set of lenses) or a D50 and a GREAT lens (or set) go with the latter.All the Nikon DSLRs that are currently available are super, and the glass is way more important.So...I would say, instead of getting a D70 and an 18-70, get a D50 and one of those swank 18-200s from Nikon (which is TOTALLY cool) although you will wait for the 18-200 (Do NOT get a Sigma or Tamron... Stick with Nikon). That's what I did. I'm very happy with them!Lastly... Get yourself one of those way cool plastic protectors for the LCD.

But if you think a little bit, there are not too many DSLR cameras on the market and for the most people the choice they make is not if they like or not some particular camera, but which camera out of a very few available they like more. So my review is not really about D50 itself, but why to choose D50 between other compeitors.I think my story is pretty typical. I've had a couple digital cameras and finally decided I'm ready for a digital SLR. After some reading and comparing specs, my short list was down to 4 entries - Canon XT and D30 and Nikon D200 and D50. I've heard a lot of people gettting to this point, so I'm sure many readers are facing the same decision.Here is how I approached that. I knew all 4 cameras can deliver what I need, but I couldn't find a \"dream\" lense I'd like. Keep in mind, when you change lenses, some dust gets inside your camera. If it sticks to your film, you may lose a shot but in DSLR, if dust lands on a sensor (technically it's a filter in front of the sensor), it will stay there and it's really hard to clean it out. The moral is you don't want to change lenses too often.Also, I was looking for a good all around lense equal to 28-100+, but with typical DSLR x1.5 multiplier, that would require something like 18-70+.Canon 17-85 and Nikon 18-70 were close, but when Nikon announced the 18-200 and reviewes confirmed it's a good lense, I set my mind. Nikon 18-200 is the lense I want and it's ahead of the next one (Canon 17-85) by a huge margin.So now my choice was down to D200 or D50. A first reaction was if D200 costs triple of D50, that should be the one. But when I started looking closely, I realized it's not that obvious. Some key factors:- Megapixels. Everyone points out D200 is 10+ and D50 is 6+, but is it a big deal? I've been shooting with 5MPixel camera for a few years and it's never been a limiting factor. So too me anything above 5M is ok.- D200 is faster. Same thing. Both cameras turn on instantly, both are focusing faster then I can start noticing any delays, both have very fast shutter release and multiple shots per second. Yes, D200 specs are better, but it wouldn't make difference for me.- Convinience. What really changed my mind is set of controls on D200. Most people probably just set camera to Auto and never change it. I usually switch between preset modes like \"Portrait\" or \"Landscape\" and sometimes add some EV compensation. Guess what, D200 does not have those preset modes! Yes, it has a lot of other controls and you can fine tune D200 better then D50, but it requires different skills. I just tried mentally compare how would I take some typical shots with each camera and I realized that I'd feel more comfortable with D50. That was a big factor.- Price. $1000 difference in favor of D50.So my line of thinking was:Because I like the Nikon 18-200 lense so much, it has to be Nikon. Because D200 and D50 meet my requirements, but I feel more comfortable with D50 controls (and by the way, it's a grand cheaper!).So the conclusion is I can't see any better value then Nikon D50 + Nikon 18-200 lense.P.S.: This is not related to this particular camera, but maybe it will help you make your choice.Keep in mind, that a good lense will keep it's value for years. But for the same price in a couple years you will be able probably to buy a much better camera body. So to me it's much smarter to invest in a great lense then in the latest and greatest camera.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nikon Has It All Over Canon", "Author": "Just a DYI GUY \"Alan S.\"", "ReviewID": "R1IW70Z87RNGP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a long time Nikon user, it seemed only natural to \"stay in the family so to speak\" when purchasing a DSLR. I decided to look into Canons after hearing so many rave reviews, and to make sure I was getting the best camera for my money. The Canon Digital Rebel Series of cameras felt small and toy like in my hands. The Nikon D50 felt well, like a Nikon. Larger, heavier, more durable and like an old friend. I found the controls and program modes extremely user friendly. This is coming from someone who has used Nikon FM and FM2 35mm cameras ( these cameras are fully manual and can even work without batteries) for over two decades. The D50 metering system is simply superb in all modes. I was a bit disappointed that there is not a depth of field preview button on the camera. This concern was quickly dispelled by the very bright screen on the back of the camera. Another plus, especially for old Nikon users like my self, is that most all Nikon lenses from the past can be used on this camera. My first photos shot using the D50 were so sharp, they looked like prints made from Kodachrome in my old cameras. From beginner to seasoned photographers, the Nikon D50 is a superb choice.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great entry level DSLR", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "ROD8C37OZZJ41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I extensively researched many entry level DSLRs.  I was focusing on the Nikons, Canons and Olympus models (the new Olympus ones - E300 and 500).  Olympus has a pretty strong story now.  Both the 300 and 500 have great features and are fairly inexpensive.  However, the somewhat limited lens selection (not only an issue for buying, but also for selling if you ever want to get rid of a lens) and lack of history in this arena led me to look at other manufacturers.  For Canon, the E series cameras are great, but expensive.  The Rebel series felt a bit \"cheap\" and low end to me.  That led me to Nikon.  The D50 is priced very well and offers many great features.  The only feature I may miss over the D70/70s is a depth of field preview, but this is less important with digital since you can play around with many different focus points and aperture settings.  The D50 also lets you zoom in pretty close with the LCD screen so you can see what you shot.  I was thinking about getting only the 18-55 lens, but seeing as the price difference wasn't huge for the extra lens, I went for it.  I have the camera for about a week now and love it!I don't love the software that came with the camera, but that's just my opinioin.  In searching for options on how to deal with Nikon's NEF RAW files, I discovered the open source imaging program called GIMP.  So far, this is as close to a free Adobe Photoshop I could find, and deals with the Nikon proprietary NEF file format, so I am very happy.I put a sample pic on this website that I shot in NEF and used GIMP to convert to .jpg.  It is a somewhat gloomy shot, but it is just about winter here in New England so there's a lot of that around now!  It is entitled Tobacco Farm in the Winter.To summarize, I love the camera and think it is the best choice for a DSLR in the $1000 range.

Still I got a few pleasant surprises (BTW all the good things you have heard are also true):1. The pictures are prettier than I thought, especially regarding the color and contrast. I have heard warnings that D-SLRs do not automatically give you better-looking pictures and that you need to understand the camera better to get the job done right.  That is not so for D-50.  It does automatically gives you better-looking pictures. (Of course the more you understand the better.) Don't assume the more expensive cameras necessarily take better pictures. D-50 has done some smart processing in camera. And there are plenty of adjustments you can make to suit different tastes.2. The ergonomics and control layouts matter more than I thought.  And Nikon got it right.  A pure joy to use.3. 6MP is just enough for me.  I do look at my pictures close up on screen but do not make large print often.  I did not find myself missing the higher megapixels.  Higher megapixels actually means inconveniently larger files for most people.  Don't oeverestimate how important the megapixels are to you.

From reviews to pro photographers: both cameras are great and you can't go wrong with neither of them. Recommendations were mostly: play with both and see which one feels better in your hand.And so I did and purchased both at Costco (great return policy). At the end I kep the D50.The D50 provides a better feel and professional handling than the Rebel XT, for my taste of course.A deal-breaker was the lack of out-of-box RAW support, thus the comments from another reviewer, \"L.

But now, that Adobe RAW 3.2 is out, I'm happy to report that the white balance is proplery 'decoded' and appears as captured by the CCD.So far, I'm so happy with the D50 and don't regret not going for the rebel XT. From the focus system (with the default kit lens), to the color reproduction, to exceptional low-light shooting, and continous shooting, the D50 is very very impressive.Sure the Rebel XT packs more pixels and it is a terrific D-SLR; but its feel and build quality left something to be desired, not to mention that the flash must be used for AF illuminator and that some settings are simply shortcut to the menus.

Feldman \"Technophile\"", "ReviewID": "R3LMTPCDTBCH6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Growing up in the 70s and 80s as a photo enthusiast I had a succession of Nikon SLRs and lenses and was deeply devoted to them.  In the late 90s and early 2000s I was seduced by the ability to manipulate and quickly print digital pictures and had a succession of digital cameras including an Olympus D490z and a Canon G3.  These cameras had their charms, but they were slow to shoot - often missing the action.  Their dynamic range (ability to capture detail in both shadow and highlight areas) paled beside good film.  Also, their lightweight manual override modes and lenses made them poor competition to the Nikons for nighttime, macro, and special lighting photography.  I purchased a Nikon D50 almost as an impulse when I saw the price - and was prepared to be disappointed.  For the most part I was thrilled.What's hot:1) This camera is FAST.  Just like my film SLR, the camera is instantly on when I turn it on and shoots as fast as my finger drops (except when the flash is involved - just like my SLR).  I finally get action shots of the kids!  Yipeee!  This feature alone totally sold my wife on this camera.2) Autofocus is awesome - seems to have ESP when picking subjects.  Has quick and easy target selection override.3) Great dynamic range and resolution.  Shooting in fine jpeg mode allows me to print in whatever size I like - up to 8x10 without obvious artifacts.  Tones are smooth without visible plateaus most of the time and have good detail in both shadow and bright areas.4) Great flexibility.  A wealth of modes gives me shortcuts to operational modes that handle a wealth of special sitation photography.  Manual overrides give me amazing control.5) Good (but not perfect) meter.6) Small and extremely light weight for an SLR.7) 18-55mm lens has good wide angle range, somewhat limited telephoto - but covers all the basics with aplomb.  I seldom want for more.8) Great macro mode in the built-in camera.  Nikon has purpose-built macro lenses, but the macro in the standard 18-55 is way better than the G3's $85 macro add-on solution.  Images of coins fill the frame and you can see tiny detail.  Way more than adequate for selling coins or stamps on Ebay.9) I find this camera very attractive10) Integrated help screens in many of the menus.  This camera is deep.  You will not get the most out of it unless you take the time to learn about it.  Once you have the gist - the help screens help you remember what's up when you're out in the field.NOTs1) I can't use my old Nikon AI lenses.  They fit - but don't communicate with the meter.2) Superlightweight for the size - will it be durable?3) It may be lightweight for the size - but this is still an SLR and can't compete with smaller cameras for portability.  This doesn't fit in any pockets - it hangs around your neck or lives in a kit bag.4) Doesn't have a \"B\" mode on shutter release - limiting its use for astrophotography.  This is too bad because it's so light.5) 18-55mm lens isn't as cool as the 18-70mm lens the D70S ships with.  Oh well - the 18-55 is still mighty fine for the price.  If you have more scratch buy the D50 body and get the 18-70 ala cart.6) This a serious camera for photo enthusiasts.  While the awesome speed and image quality in full auto mode makes it easy for beginners to get started, a point and shoot user is going to to frustrated by this camera because the magic requires a half hour with the manual and some basic photo knowledge.7) 2\" screen on the back is fixed - it's more for settings and looking at pictures after you shoot than for shooting.  You shoot while looking through the viewfinder on this camera.  This fits the whole SLR ethos.  I sometimes miss the cool articulated screen with the G3 that let me hold the camera at arm's length - like low to the ground or high in the air to get cool \"point of view\" shots.  That's right out with the D50.8) Secure Digital Media - a strength or weakness depending on your perspective.  Most other DSLRs use compact flash and I'm selling my nice collection of compact flash cards on Ebay right now.Bottom line?  After 25 years I'm finally selling my Nikon FA (and all my darkroom equipment).  The D50 is so good that I'm putting film to bed at last.  The shooting experience with the D50 is as good as film in most areas and better in some others.  The fact that you can bring this home for under eight bills is gravy.  This price, by the way is pretty much exactly what the film SLRs ended up costing in adjusted dollars.  Kudos to Nikon for leapfrogging Canon with the killer entry level DSLR.  Last point - this might BE the entry level DSLR - but nothing FEELs entry level about it.  This is a real serious - GOOD - tool for photography.  It's a revolutionary product from my perspective.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good for beginners", "Author": "Kyle Lanclos", "ReviewID": "R1XPNSUM2ARM4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D50 is the newest rung in Nikon's ladder of digital DLR cameras. Compared to the competition (which you can read about all you want on the wider web), it offers an excellent feature set at an excellent price point. If low cost was your only concern, you can't really go wrong with the D50. It is an excellent camera, but make no mistake, it is not as capable as Nikon's other offerings. It is also worth remembering that no camera will take pictures for you; you can take astounding pictures with any camera, either astoundingly good, or astoundingly bad. The important feature of any camera is that your camera does not get in the way of your photography, but again, it is your photography, not the camera, that takes good pictures.If you are shopping for a D50, I strongly encourage you to consider the D70: it has more features and the same basic usability as the D50, and the cost is pretty much the same. The D70s is more expensive, but has a couple of newer features than the D70; as far as taking pictures goes, the D70 and D70s are pretty much the same camera.Why the D70? Two main reasons. One is the kit lens (18-70mm) that comes with the D70 kit package. The 18-55mm lens that ships with the D50 kit is a lower-end lens (note that I'm not calling it a bad lens), but the 18-70 lens that comes in the D70 kit is an excellent lens. You may quickly feel limited by the D50 kit lens, but the D70 kit lens is good enough that you would not feel ashamed if you were using it on Nikon's flagship camera, the D2x.The second reason to go with the D70 is that it leaves more doors open if you want to upgrade later on. It supports more of the high-end functions of the more expensive Nikon digital SLRs (such as the wireless flash capabilities of Nikon's iTTL system), and it uses CompactFlash memory cards-- if you do decide to upgrade, you won't have to buy a whole new set of memory cards. The memory card business is a minor consideration, but if you're a starving artist trying to scrimp together the money to upgrade, a couple hundred bucks can make a difference. After all, that's part of why you're looking at the D50, right?Think of the extra $50-100 you spend on a D70 as an investment in your new hobby. It's not as important if you plan on buying a new camera body every year, but for those of us that plan on using the camera for several years, the versatility is more than worth the price.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "High quality and highly affordable", "Author": "Kyle D.

In '02 I went digital with a small Canon S30 P&S.; That camera got me a lot of great pictures, but I'd take out the N70 every now and then because it took so much better pictures.  Digital, however, is just so much more convenient to use now a days.I always longed for a dSLR ever since Nikon launched their first back around 1999-2000. Those were the $5000 units. One day, the price would come down. They then came out with the D100. Still out of my price range. The D70 and D70s started to make my dSLR dreams more real. After the D50 was launched, I was still convienced that the D70s was the way to go.  Then I started reading reviews. The D50, although considered \"An entry level\" camera, was nothing to take lightly. The more I looked into it the more I realized that maybe the D50 was for me. I didn't really need a lot of the 'bells and whistles' of the D70s. It has the same sensor (which is better than the D70 and D100), the D50 only goes to 1/4000th of sec instead of 1/8000th of sec (but how many pictures of hummingbirds do we really take?), command dials: 1 vs 2 - my film camera's only had 1 I wont miss the other, same for the DOF preview and backlit LCD, plus the info that is there can also been seen in the viewfinder.  If you want a DOF preview, take the picture and look at it in the 2\" LCD. Those extra things weren't worth $300 to me, especially for the same amount of mexapixels, 6.1.I've had the D50 for a little more than 6 months now. In addition to the camera I bought the Nikkor 18-70mm lens (I wanted a bit more reach than the 18-55mm). This compliments my old Quantaray 70-300mm telephoto zoom lens I used with my N70. I also purchased the Nikkor 50mm f/1.8, which is worth its weight in gold. Outstanding pictures and its inexpensive at just over 100 dollars.I've taken about 2500 pictures thus far, including a 4 day photo trip to Walt Disney World. This camera does not disapoint. I haven't used any of the preset settings. I use P, S, A or M only. AFAIC, this is an SLR camera, not a point and shoot.This camera has brought me back into photography as a hobby. Everything I learned in high school and then forgot, I've now picked up again and the results are outstanding.If you do get this camera or already have it, do yourself a favor and learn about lighting. Learn how shutter speeds and aperture and ISO affect your pictures. Once you get the hang of it you will only improve your pictures.Also keep in mind, that this is really only a light tight box and the pictures you take with it are more influenced by the lens you have on it.  This makes this camera even better in that it is less expensive and will allow you to get better lenses (ie: 18-70mm, 50mm f/1.8, or if you really want supurb results: 17-55 f/2.8, 35-70 f/2.8, 105mm f/2.8 VR macro and the big daddy,,, 70-200mm f/2.8 VR)The beauty of SLR's are the interchangeable lenses. There will always be a lens you'll want next.  The beauty of digital SLR's, they record all the information along with the image, ie: shutter speed, f/stop, ISO, white balance, lens used, date/time, focal length used, if flash was fired and more. This information, if you use it, will improve your photography skills. No need for bringing along a notebook. Digital is your friend!!Enjoy.

Then I went digital and bought a point-and-shoot Nikon Coolpix 2500 and really enjoyed being able to take a lot of photos and just delete the ones I didn't like. It was fun for awhile, but I began to miss the speed and versatility of an SLR.I started reading product and user reviews about different brands and models of digital SLRs, including the Canon Rebel, and narrowed it down to either the Nikon D70 or D50. The D70 has a few more 'bells and whistles' but, for me, the differences didn't justify the extra cost. For instance, I never used the depth-of-field preview function on my old Canon so I knew I wouldn't miss that. The D50 also doesn't have a backlit LCD screen but I haven't had a problem with that, either.I've used the D50 for a few months now and I couldn't be happier!! The day I got it I unpacked it, attached the lens and started taking photos and they turned out beautifully just using the auto setting. Since then, I've been using different modes, like aperature and shutter priority, and I'm totally blown away by the quality of the photos and what this camera is capable of.I'm very happy with this 18-55mm DX lens. It focuses fast and the photos are very sharp. I wanted a longer lens, too, so I recently ordered the Nikkor 28-200mm G and I'm thrilled with it. Since it's not a \"DX\" lens, on a digital Nikon it's the equivalent of 42-300mm and I've gotten some great, sharp photos with it.The more I use this camera, the more I love it and I'm having lots of fun with it. There's been a definite learning curve for me because it's capable of so much, but it's also easy to use on the auto setting.Some recommendations...- For the SD card, the SanDisk Ultra II Plus is handier than heck because you just take it out of your camera, fold it and plug it into your computer's USB port - no need for a card reader.- The wireless remote is great to have instead of using the camera's timer.- The Nikon CF-D50 case is very nice and I use it all the time when I take my camera with me.", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Thomas Rawlinson \"AARP fodder\"", "ReviewID": "RM31Z0AL0UM48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also have a Nikon D-100 digital camera and the D50 is about equal in quality to the more expensive camera.

The D-50 is more compact and slightly lighter in weight than the D-100 or D-70.One consideration is to get the D-50 body and buy a seperate lens of your choosing for the D-50. The lens that comes with the D-50 kit only goes to 55mm; a broader range might be a better choice.Besides Nikon, Sigma and Tamron make excellent lenses for Nikons at a reasonable price.

When the D50 came out, accompanied with fantastic reviews in the digital photo magazines, I finally took the plunge.This is a GREAT camera.  Really versatile, and terrific image quality.6 megapixels is, as I understand it, the digital equivalent of a 35mm film resolution.  Be sure, though, to keep the ISO setting as low as possible.  Just as shooting 800ASA film will introduce more grain to your film shots, even shooting 400ISO will introduce much unwanted video noise to your digital shots.Battery life is amazing.  I recently had a 14 hour shoot, in which I shot over 1500 frames.  I planned ahead and bought a spare battery -- only, I never needed it!  I've used the camera often since the beginning of the year -- the battery charge indicator has remained on 'full' since my last charge, around Christmas.The most important issue with any camera, though, is image quality.  This baby exceeds all expectations.  As a point-and-shoot (full auto mode), it's phenominal.  Start messing with the myriad of available settings, and you can do anything with it.In full auto mode, I recommend killing the flash in all but the most necessary situations (nighttime parties, for example -- you've got no other choice).All in all, this is a brilliant, wonderful, exceptional camera.One final note -- piece of advice I heard often as I was doing my research:If you already have a film-based SLR camera, be sure to check out the digital SLRs made by your film camera's manufacturer.  If you have Nikon already, the D50 is great and you can probably use most if not all of your existing lenses on this body.  If you have Canon film cameras, the digital rebels will be able to use those lenses and they also create great shots.I've long been a Nikon fan and am even able to use the manual-everything lens from my 30 year-old EM with the D50.

If you're really serious you can get a battery grip and double the power.It's infrared sensitive--I put on a Hoya R72 and was taking IR pictures like regular snapshots.  Compared to my previous experience of timed exposures and hot spots this was amazing.Lenses!  The 18-55 kit lens is actually pretty good, and will satisfy a lot of situations, but if you need something else there's a wide selection.  Pretty much any Nikon F mount from 1959 on up can be used, but you're better off with the newer ones intended for digitals.  I have a 50mm f 1.8 prime, the 18-55, 70-300, and a 19-35.  If money would ever permit I'd get a 12-24 and the VR 18-200.It's fast!  I was used to the horridly slow autofocus of those \"pro\" lookalike cameras, now I can capture action and speedshots.RAW format!  Being able to take pictures in RAW format has opened up a whole new world for me.  Many shots that would otherwise be unuseable can be fixed, and I can compltetely change the mood and feel of an image without destroying it.I've used this camera for timed expsures, night astronomy shots, action, and close ups.  The D70s has some high end features like fine tuning the white balance adjustment and using multiple flashes, but unless you really need those there's not that much difference between th3 D50 and D70.There is one important thing to note:Get an LCD protector!I still don't understand why these cameras have an LCD in the most vulnerable area possible with nothing to keep it from getting scratched.  I use a snap-on protector which has a little flip up window, giving both protection from glare on sunny days and some armor from bumps and scratches.The only thing I wish this camera had is what no SLR has, namely a movie mode.  It would be possible, they have the ability to raise the mirror and a special wide angle lens with a quiet focus could be made.

She had used an analog SLR before and had a point and shoot digital, but hated the shutter lag and lack of TTL (through the lens) viewing.  We own a Nikon D-100 and lots of lenses, but she found the D-100 too complicated.  Within a few minutes of using the D-50, she loved it and was taking great pictures.  The automatic setting works well for most general shots, but the preset modes are lifesafers for dificult situations where the average photographer doesn't know about F-stops, shutter speeds or special flash settings.  The portrait mode did great portraits with nice sharp subjects and a soft blur to the background (we used a 28-300mm Tamron zoom for this trip).  Probably the best preset was the night portrait mode which gave us fill flash for well lit subjects and a slow flash setting to still capture the African sunset in the background.  I still like my (now very old and expensive seeming) D-100 and think that a more serious photographer buying today might want to consider the D-70S instead of the D-50 because the D-70 exposes more control settings, but let me say that there is nothing amateur about the shots that you can get with the D-50.

Each photo is very vibrant and sharp with no noticeable noise even at the higher ISO's.I thought \"this is too good to be true\" and started looking for situations where I thought the camera would take bad pictures.

I don't know why I didn't try SLR earlier, but now I have decided that I will never go back to non-SLR cameras (well, I still have my other 3 point and shoot digital cameras which sometime is more convenient to carry.) I guess I'm just trying to show how much I like the SLR camera.Now back about the D50. Unless you are shooting sports/actions professionaly (which then you will want to buy the D2H or D2X for faster focusing processor, faster frames per second and larger memory buffer), the D50 is pretty much all you will need (equipped with several lenses of course).The D50 has all the pre-configured settings for the casual photographers (\"child\" mode is also added for the D50, night landscape mode is not available), and it has the usual P,S,A,M mode for the more serious/advance photographer. I have stopped using the pre-set mode now and strictly uses the aperture priority and the shutter priority mode (as far as the manual mode, I'm not there yet). This shows that this camera is versatile and suitable for all ranges of skills.Comparing with its siblings (D70s, D80, D200), I think whichever you want to buy is fine. They are all great cameras. It comes down to your budget. And comparing to other brand like the canon (Rebel XT or the 30D),or pentax or sony, it will be just brand preference (and what lenses that you already have). Moreover, If you come from a point and shoot camera user, any SLR brand you buy I don't think you will be dissapointed (just the fact that SLR performs better in most important aspect of photography)Image quality of the D50 is good which is #1 factor that I look for in a digital camera.Here are the pros and cons of the D50 in my opinion:Pros:1. Nice out of the camera result picture quality (on Auto setting, and pre-programmed setting)2. Fit perfectly on my hand (grip nicely)3. Instant on and can take picture right away4. 2.5 frames per second5. large 2 inch LCD6. Battery life (will take 400-2000 shots on a single charge depend on how often you use the full power flash)7. Uses SD card8. Fast USB2 connection9. capability to copy and re-size pictures to small size (great for email)10. repeating #1 again. Great image qualityCons (which are mostly minor):1. No backlight on top panel2. No Black and White picture mode3. No night landscape mode4. No ISO 100 (and on ISO 1600 the picture is grainy though still usable)5. No depth-of-field preview button6. No front command dial7. 1/4000 max shutter speedI started using this camera for landscape and portrait, but later on I started shooting sports/action and night (low light) settings, hence I added the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 AF-D which is a great prime lens and I'm recommending to everyone to get this \"fast\" lens. I'm also recommending you to get the Nikon 70-300M f/4-5.6 AF G, which is a nice (for the price) zoom lens. If you have the budget then go for the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR AF-S which I think the best zoom lens that nikon currently have. (The VR really works especially for stationary object. If the object you want to photograph is moving and in low light situation/indoor then you will need a \"fast\" lens, i.e. lens with large aperture such as f/2.8, f/1.8, or f/1.4 etc)Happy Photographing!Sidarta Tanu", "Date": "September 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "A fantastic camera!", "Author": "Alfred T.

I had read some of the reviews that talked about the focus time being too slow, particularly on the 55-200MM lense, so I was just a bit worried about its performance.  Maybe it's because I am not experienced enough with SLR cameras, but those must have been very demanding users of the D50.  I found it to be just short of instantaneous with the 18-55MM lense, and about a hundreth of a second slower with the 55-200 lense.  I thought it peformed just great!  And it takes great pictures.  I admit - I have a long way to go to learn to use all the features of this camera.  I probably never will master it completely, but I already know I am going to have a great time learning.  This is my first SLR other than my Pentax 35MM film camera, and only my second experience with a digital camera.  My first camera was (still is) an Olympus C-2040, another great camera.  I can't recommend that highly enough, either.  No one, unless you are a skilled professional, should worry about whether the D50 can serve your needs.  And most professionals I know would not turn down the D50.  As a matter of fact, on the cruise, I was approached by two of the shipboard photographers who noticed I was carrying the D50.  Each said it was a quality camera that they could and would use in their work.  I thought that was a pretty good endorsement.  Regarding the speed of the camera overall:  I was watching the glass enclosed external elevators used in the atrium.  There were four of them.  We were watching to see when all four of them stopped at the same floor at the same time.  Kind of like a slot machine - waiting for the 7's to roll up.  One of my party yelled \"There they are!\"  I grabbed my camera, which was in the OFF position.  As I raised the camera, I clicked the on switch and started rotating the barrel of the lense as the camera was coming up.  As it came up to my eye, I got it at the right focal length, pressed the shutter release button halfway for it to focus, and snapped the picture just as one of the elevators started up.  All this happened in what you might call a split second.  The camera caught the scene with no blurr.  It was like a quick draw.  How much faster does anyone need for a camera to be?  Buy it!

Out of the box problem: dangerous battery recall - visit nikon.ca for details - set me back almost 3 weeks as I waited for the battery replacement. On the good side, I received a higher capacity battery in exchange.2. Very annoying issue -  Shooting in full auto mode produces slightly softfocus images.

Using self-timer or a remote does not allow for continuous shooting. This is particularly dissapointing during the holiday season. You know what it's like when you pose everyone for that family photo, set the camera on the tripod, and everyone freezes unnaturally - the camera fires and everyone relaxes and that's when you want the continuous shooting mode, to capture that moment of relaxation on everyone's face. Not possible! Continuous shooting only available when physically depressing the power button - using a remote is just a split second too slow.4. Af assist illuminator positioned too close to lens - larger zoom lenses cover the illuminator and camera can't focus in low light situations.5. Three step photo playback zooming: must press two buttons to zoom in on a photo taken + dial. Needless complication.6.

The D50 is simpler but that is not a bad thing. I find the single command dial to be a nice feature. When you take the camera from A to S mode the function of the dial changes with you making for a very efficient system. If you don't do a lot of wirelss flash or feel the need to fiddle with the white balance then there is effectively no difference between the D70 and D50 bodies. When you take a few minutes to look over the specs of the D50 you will find a very powerful picture taking tool. This camera may be simplified to bring down the cost of manufacture but it certianly has not been \"dumbed down\" to meet a price point. I recommend you ignore all the picture modes and concentrate on mastering P A S & M settings. Also exploring the slow sync setting to make flash pictures look more natural will pay off in much nicer photos.

It is my 3d digital camera (the second was Olympus C-4040 Zoom, which is a great camera too). This is my first digital SLR, and it is a pleasure to take pictures with. The quality of the pictures is superb. I also tried to take photos of the sportsmen jumping from an Olympic trampoline in Lake Placid, NY, and I was amazed with the results.  While the jumper flies in front of me (I was positioned to the side from the point of actual jump), the distance is constantly changing, and I can not keep him exactly in the center all the time, because the whole event is too fast. Nevertheless, most of the shots are amazingly in focus, so auto focus works magic.  The manual is reasonably clear, it was more or less easy to understand what they mean. The enclosed 256 Meg memory card holds about 130-150 pictures in medium resolution (JPEG files are around 1.5M), but when I switched resolution to high, the number of pictures shrank to 20-something, so I bought SD card of a 2 Gigabyte capacity on Amazon (attention: the camera takes SD-type cards, I first bought CompactFlash card, which of course, did not fit). The big memory card comes very handy even with medium resolution shots, if you start taking pictures in \"automatic\" mode, shooting 2.5 pictures per second in short bursts - the 250 M card does not last too long. The battery life is incredible. So far I charged the battery once, went on vacation, shoot almost every day in daylight and in night conditions (with a flash), at room temperature and in cold (it was around 22 F) and downloaded pictures to lap-top, and a couple of times forgot to switch it off, and battery indicator still says it is full. The camera comes with software on CD, but I did not get to it yet. So far I just connect the camera to the lap top with Windows XP, and it recognizes it as an additional hard drive, and I just drag the JPEG files from there. The camera feels very nice in hand (I have it with 18-55 mm zoom auto focus lens) and actually is much lighter that I would have expected by looking at it. In addition several people around said \"this is a nice camera\" and I could not agree more.  The only thing I found silly, is that while the camera knows that some shots are taken in \"vertical position\" (e.g. `portrait', rather than `landscape'), they do appear in a right orientation while viewed in the camera, but not in the computer, I still need to use software (such as PhotoShop) to turn them 90 deg, but this is a small matter.

The body is light and is well-balanced.(2) It is bigger than the Canon Rebel XT (or 350D), which to me feels a bit too small. I usually prefer slim over bulky but in this case I feel that the Nikon's proportions are better. I have test-driven the Rebel for a week-end and I would say it's more geared towards smaller hands.(3) The price is right as they say. With the lens kit you barely spend over 600 usd, a couple of hundred dollars cheaper than the competition at the time of this writing. It is unlikely that the premium is worth it, esp. if you're looking into entry-level DSLR. The next thing you'll want to upgrade is the lens (check out the Carl Zeiss lenses)(4) It uses SD cards, which is what most point-and-shoot use (well, some at least). Going for a Compact flash-backed camera (such as the Canon) means spending another 50 usd for memory.(5) Mega-pixel count plays a lesser role in the quality of the pictures than the metering logic of the camera, your ability to compose and the printing proces.", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "One fine, fast D-SLR!", "Author": "Charley Cross", "ReviewID": "R5WNTC0CQQBYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The D50 has all the Nikon quality I've come to expect.

When you press the shutter release, it shoots right then--not half a second later like many digital cameras, which miss critical shots. You can shoot in rapid sequence--no waiting around for it to process the last shot. It focuses fast, too. Spring for the extra money for a high-speed SD card and you'll get screaming transfer times, too.The only complaint I have is the little rubber cover that hides the USB and other ports is a little hard to get smoothly all the way back into place. A pretty minor complaint.An unexpected bonus compared to all the little digital point-and-shoot cameras I've used is the D50 has a 3:2 aspect ratio instead of 4:3.

I now primarily use a Nikon D90 which is mind blowing for its price, but I would still never get rid of my D50.Why??----- This camera is simply easy to use for a DSLR, lightweight, technically amazing at 6mp if you can use it well, and the ergonomics on the camera are better (in my opinion) than pretty much any other DSLR I've ever held. Like I said, that's my opinion, but the camera simply feels great in hand, and looks very nice as well.It has an auto-focus motor in the body so you can use it with pretty much any Nikon lens ever made and it gives amazing results in manual mode. While newer cameras like the D90 and up into the way more expensive professional models current in 2010 have \"technically\" better image quality the D50 is kind of like a digital holga for me. As any good photographer knows, megapixels don't mean jack sh** beyond getting somewhat more detail in huge prints---a medium format film camera doesn't take inherently \"better\" images than a 35mm film camera unless there is an objective goal of more detail in the final (large) print. Getting back to the D50, the image quality is superb and even in huge prints (I've made prints as large as 40\"x50\" with the D50) even though there might not be as much detail, the results are stunning if you know what you are doing in photoshop, lightroom, etc.As of 2010 if I sold this camera on EBAY the money I would get would not be worth what the camera is really worth. Only much farther in the future when this camera is truly an antique might it actually be worth a lot more. Therefore I'm definitely keeping and using this camera for a long time to come. It is a great backup camera or still primary camera for that matter outside of paid work. I also didn't mention, but I truly think this camera can take more of a beating than other Nikon DSLRs that don't have magnesium bodies. The plastic body is superb and if I ever dropped it hard I'm sure the impact would be absorbed easily.All in all if you can still get one of these don't hesitate because it is only 6mp. 6mp raw or .jpg files are way easier to handle than some of the 12mp or 21mp files I've handled.

This camera is aimed at everyone from the beginning amateur to the professional who wants a spare SLR body to supplement a higher end camera body.  The D50 allows the amateur to own an SLR body for about the price of a high-end point-and-shoot pocket camera.  Of course, on top of this one must buy one or more Nikon (or compatible) lenses, but good lenses for this camera can be had at very reasonable prices.In this review I will not elaborate a lot on the various features this camera has, since such information is available in more detail elsewhere.  But there are certain things about this camera that really are impossible not to like.  The autofocus is quick and sure, and features several modes including an automatic multi-field mode that tracks the subject.  This, combined with the lightning-fast data buffer, allows the user to take rapid-fire shots of sporting events.  And the various exposure modes available on the camera make good exposures, sharp focus, and vivid colors a snap.  This is a really great camera for the enthusiastic amateur who does not want to stop and figure out F stops, depth of field, etc.  Thus, the D50 offers the photographer an alternative to point-and-shoot cameras which also provide computerized exposure modes, but it has more advanced electronics than most of them, and most importantly it can utilize professional quality Nikon lenses to which the lenses on most pocket cameras cannot really compare.Accessories?  The obvious one is the choice of lens (or lenses).  This camera is offered body-only or as part of various \"kits\" which provide some very good lens choices.  You will need an SD card which is where the images are stored.  Most users will do well to go with at least a 1GB Secure Digital (SD) card.  Yes, Nikon deviated from its usual commitment to the CF format, and the D50 uses the SD format.  No problem.  Other accessories for the serious amateur will include a spare battery for the camera, and yes, perhaps an external flash.  The camera comes with a very decent built-in flash which is fine for casual snapshots, but for the serious amateur the Nikon SB800 (my favorite) or SB600 is a must.Basically, right out of the box, with a good SD card and lens, the D50 will do more than a high-end pocket camera for a similar price.  But unlike the pocket camera, the D50 is a camera that one can grow into, right up to the level of near-pro.  This is a fine piece of equipment.Construction of the D50 is outstanding.  It is plainly a solidly-built, quality instrument that feels great in one's hand--this is no flimsy amateur toy.  This is a rugged piece of equipment that if treated with respect will give years of enjoyment.The D50 is one of the very best deals out there as of February 2006 for the serious amateur photographer who wants to graduate to a digital SLR.", "Date": "February 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Perfect Affordable First-Time Digital SLR!", "Author": "R.

This camera is well-built and even with \"only\" 6 megapixels, it'll still blow away most modern point-and-shoot cameras.The key feature that the D50 has that NONE of the entry-level Nikons (ie <$1000) have had since is the \"drive screw\".  What is it?  Basically, it's a feature that allows this camera to autofocus lenses that don't have a focus motor built into the lens itself.  On Nikon lenses, this is AF vs. AF-S.  The AF lenses need the screw drive to work, whereas the AF-s lenses have the motor built in.  One key lens is the Nikon 50mm f1.8 AF lens.  It's a superb value lens that can be had under $100.  Having the drive screw also opens up lens options from Sigma, Tamron, and other 3rd-parties and these lenses are often much cheaper as well.Therefore, if you're hesitant about buying a DSLR because of the price, or you're not sure of which brand you want to commit to, try out a used D50, get a couple of these cheaper lenses, and you'll have a great kit for probably less than you'd spend on one of the newer entry-level DSLR's.Where you will find this camera lacking compared to other more modern replacements is in continuous shooting speed, no SDHC capability, and poorer high-ISO (>800) performance.

Yes, there are some nicer features on D70s, but quite frankly I can live without them.

All SLR manuals are only sufficient to get you through the controls of the camera.  SLRs are not point and shoot and nobody will explain about details of how to take a picture.  In the old days, classes were highly recommended.  But with DSLR, you have no excuse but to blast through hundreds of photos to figure out what is the best way to take a photo.  About the only thing you need is a notebook to keep track of what settings you did and describe the conditions around you.  Though I own and watched N90 video (in the mid 90's) I found this wonderful site:[...]Let the flash load completely, and click on \"Open Menu\" and Nikon will guide you through the basics.  If you go through the entire tutorial, I think it's the equivalent of video tutorial you can buy from them..

I recently upgraded from a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 to the Nikon D50, and it was definitely worth the investment. Picture quality is simple wonderful. I chose the D50 over a KonicaMinolta and Canon models in large part because of the very low noise the camera produces even at high ISOs. Noise at high ISOs was a major issue with the Lumix I had previously. I also chose this over the Canon Digital Rebel XT because the Rebel is actually too small. The buttons get crammed and are easly pressed by mistake, and with a good lens (the kit lens for the Rebel isn't too spectacular) the balance of the camera is way off. Neither of these is an issue with the D50. The D50 is very quick to focus in automatic mode, controls are easy to use, shot to shot time is wonderful. Battery life, which often seems to be an issue with digital cameras, is not with the D50. My father has a Canon Digital Rebel, and claims that this camera (the D50) is nicer, and the built in flash especially impressed him. The only thing is that while the two included lenses are quite good, neither makes a good general purpose lens. The 18-55 mm is often too short, and the 55-200mm one is often too long, so you need to swap lenses a lot. That said, this being an SLR, I plan on picking up a third lens in the future that ranges from say 28 mm to 200 or 300 mm.Highly recommended camera!", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the experienced amateur", "Author": "D.

It was still working fine but I was beginning to run into many of its limitations: poor battery life, slow shot-to-shot performance, inability to focus in dim conditions, noisy images at high ISO and/or long shutter speeds, SmartMedia memory cards limited to 128 MB and etc.The D50 has none of these problems.  I took a couple hundred pictures over the Christmas holiday (with frequent use of the flash) and never had to charge the battery.  The D50 has a high-speed, ~3 frame-per-second mode and can take pictures as fast as you'd like.I purchased the 18-70 DX lens instead of the 18-55 lens that normally comes with the D50.  With this combination it rarely has trouble focusing.  And even if it's a little off, you can manually fine-tune the focus after the autofocus has given it its best shot.  It is so nice to have a true, optical, through-the-lens viewfinder.  I often had parallax errors with the viewfinder in my old P&S.;I'm also a huge fan of the D50's low noise at high ISO settings.  I can shoot at 1600 ISO in dim conditions with about the same level of noise as my old camera has at 100 ISO.If you think you've grown out of your P&S; digicam, go ahead and get a D-SLR.  The performance is so much better and it will make you want to start taking pictures again.  And unlike point and shoots, megapixels don't matter as much with a D-SLR.  Take the Canon 20D, for example.  It is an 8-megapixel camera (vs the D50's 6-megapixels).  While it sounds like a lot more, in reality you'll only be able to make a print that's about 2 inches wider (and the D50 makes beautiful 8x10s).Get one.

All taxes included, it was about 800$ which is extremely low priced for such a quality camera. I got home and charged the battery, which took about 3 hours for the first time.I went outside and tried it and I was really impressed by the quality given by this camera. The pictures were sharp and crisp and after about 100 pictures, I barely got ANY soft tonned pictures, if any. They were all sharp and clear.Another thing that amazed me about this camera is the ability to let the camera do all the work for you with the focus, ISO, aperture etc. or being able to partly, or fully control it yourself.Also, the camera turn on the second you to and taking pictures is very speedy.Now that was during daylight. The same day, I went up on the roof of my house and tried to take some night pictures of San Francisco. I tried some manual controls and again, I was amazed with the results. Even at 800 ISO, the noise was barely noticable and when I put them on the computer and i sent them to my friends, they wouldn't believe I had taken them myself.Last I am going to mention because, although it is only one of them, this one is one of the biggest qualities of the D50. It has a FANTASTIC battery life. I have used this little baby for one week straight, taking about 100-200 pictures a day and it did not even go down. I am telling you, this is the best battery and you could go on a trip for a whole month, without taking the charger.Ok, I could talk for a long time about all the features of this camera and sound like I'm actually working for Nikon, which i'm not. It all rounds up to this: If you are looking for a great that camera that offers a lot of manual controls but also gives you great results on the automatic mode, well this camera is for you. Don't even think about going for the Canon Rebel XT because the Nikon D50 is cheaper, and is the best camera you can get for the money on the market.If you are still hesitating, I suggest you take the plunge: you'll be glad you did.Hope this helps, enjoy.P.S: I strongly recommend you take the fastest SD cards on the market (Ultra II) to save your pictures. They might be a little more expensive, but it will save you a lot of time when taking the pictures.

This is an excellent entry-level SLR camera which scales very well for the advanced user.  There is a significant learning curve for cameras of this type, but that is part of the fun!  Once you've commanded the basic principles of photography and learned to use the features of the camera, there is nothing you can't do in any situation!  I can't imagine ever going back to a traditional digital camera unless I need to keep one in my pocket for 'discrete' occasions.  The advantage with SLR is control!  You are not at the mercy of a digital cameras limited or inaccessible control features.There is no need to fear!  This camera is designed for the SLR newbie!  It has all the standard automatic modes but implements them FAR better than any non-SLR digital camera (not to mention far more quickly).  However, if you really want to take advantage of this camera's unique capabilities, you will want to learn how to use it without the automatic features.  I consider this camera an investment; it has been instrumental in fostering my understanding of photography.  You won't be able to use it to its maximum potential right away so be prepared to practice extensively.My only complaint, and I bring it up only because I haven't really seen it mentioned, is that the Nikon camera seems prone to producing moir\u00e9 in some situations (like a car's radiator or thinly striped shirt).

The XT is too small around the grip for most people, IMHO.In terms of picture quality, I don't think I could be happier.  I took some pictures at a baseball game the other day and was getting 1/3200 second shutter speeds and very clear pictures.  The only not so good part (which I also read about on dpreview.com and agree with) is ISO 1600 produces some slightly grainy photos.  So, the ONLY time I would use 1600 would be in LOW light situations where a printed photo won't be larger then maybe 5 x 7 or 8 x 10.Now the best part about having this camera, is there is a song about it.

Buying the Nikon D50 DSLR has rekindled my passion for photography. Back in HS and college (when dinosaurs roamed the planet), I enjoyed my Pentax K1000 very much, and learned a lot (compared to my peers) about taking good pictures. Once digital cameras came out, the 35mm SLR when on the shelf for the ease and economy of lower quality photos. This year, I have combined the best of both worlds! The D50 takes nice shots right out of the box, and allows you to become as good a photographer as you want to become. I feel like a kid again, as I continue to explore more of the camera's possibilites, and have bought new lenses and accessories, to further add to the excitement. The potential of this camera is endless, and the results so far have been amazing. Nearly everyone who has seen my camera, and the pictures that it takes, has said that they want one too. My only \"regret\" was getting the 28-80mm lens, instead of the 18-70mm kit lens, but it  gave me the opportunity to later buy an even wider lens (15-30mm), which I probably wouldn't have done if I had chosen the kit lens (which I'm told is superb).

This was another carefully considered purchase and every potential buyer should spend some time figuring out whether they want just the body (and find other lenses) or will be happy with one of the kits that are available.I can honestly say that the research was worth the time and effort.

The D50 will autofocus them.  All of the D50s will eventually be all second-hand or refurbished, but I would not let that stop me from buying one (for mine is refurbished).The beauty of this camera is that it operates almost exactly like my Nikon N65.  The learning curve is very small.  And even though it is only 6.1 megapixels (while so many are moving to the 10MP route) the standard prints I get are sharp and crisp.  As one camera salesman and expert told me, it is not always the megapixels that make a good picture, it is also the lense.

The other beauty of this camera is that you can correct your mistakes right away, with the instant preview on the LCD.  Film cameras do not have that luxury.

(Also, a few questions at the end)", "Author": "Anthony Chiappette \"chippe01\"", "ReviewID": "R2WEHE2YHOJPFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me say first off, that I am an avid amateur when it comes to photography, and I love taking pictures.  I was always a fan of digital as I am an impatient soul who needs immediate results, and digital offers that.  I previously owned many different point and shoot digitals and have been pretty happy with them. My latest Kodak V550 was a joy to use and very compact with excellent picture results.However, that has all changed for me now.  My main reason for getting into DSLR is that I have recently dicovered Stereoscopy, or 3D photography, and I was looking for a convenient way to accomplish this.I discovered the Loreo 3D Lens in a Cap system for Digital SLR cameras and decided this might be the way to go.  In researchibg different models, I came accross the D50 and read tons of reviews for this camera which pretty much sold me.  I purchased the camera with the 28-105mm AF D lens. Since my main object was to be 3D, I didn't really care what lens came with the camera, but this is a great lens. I also purchased a spare larger capacity battery (EN-EL3e) and a 2GB SD high speed card.  I am GLAD I bought this kit. I was also fortunate that the standard battery that came with my camera was NOT part of the recall.This is my first venture into SLR and it was a bit daunting at first, but I love to read manuals. I've read the manual from front to back several times over learning the ins and outs of this camera.Since the 3D lens only operates in manual mode, I had a lot to learn.  For regular photography, I basically use the auto settings and the photos taken with this camera are a HUGE improvement over anything I have ever used before.  I use the LARGE Hi Quality JPEG files, and can get about 917 shots on the 2GB card.  With 2GB, I can get over 5,000 standard size/quality shots, but I haven't used this setting yet.I usually print 4 x 6 photos, so this setting might be overkill, but I am ready for larger prints if the need arises.  I also love the fact that you can copy any photo in the camera to an email friendly size - which saves the step of doing this manually on the computer.When using the regular AF lens attachment, there's not much to do.  It's basically point and shoot, but may require some modifications for certain settings. On full auto mode, I have not been disappointed yet.  I've had the camera for about a week and have already taken well over 1,000 photos, mostly in 3D. While the 3D lens has it's limitations and is somewhat of a disappointment, I can't blame that on this camera.There are lots of menu options, which I learned pretty quickly. Menu navigation and camera settings are easy once you learn where everything is. The most important settings ISO/shutter speed/white balance, etc can be accomplished with the buttons on back of the camera. And the buttons serve different functions depending on whether you are in shooting mode or viewing mode. The buttons are clearly labeled as to their purpose. In shooting mode, just hold a button and turn the multi-setting dial to make adjustments on the fly without even looking at a menu. I also like the fact that there is an LCD panel on top that shows all camera settings at all times - no need for the LCD monitor to view settings. This is huge power saving option. I suspect, however, this would be standard on all SLR cameras.I was very surprised at the price for this camera considering the quality of the photos, and range of settings available.  This was the perfect choice for me, and I am THORUGHLY pleased! I'm also having fun learning about the various functions.Battery life is very good, even when the camera is left on. I have not yet ordered the power supply, but I've had the camera ON for several hours at a time and it has not died yet. Once the weather gets warmer and I can go out and about, the supplied battery and the larger capacity battery will be fine for me. The charge cycle is pretty swift as well.There's only 2 gripes I have with this camera, but only 1 with the camera itself.  My apartment is very dusty and changing the lenses is a hazard for me.  I know, not the camera's fault - a hazard with any SLR camera, I guess. I am worried about getting dust inside.  No matter how many times I clean and vacuum, there's always dust floating around.  What's the best way to clean the mirror?The other gripe is with the included software. It is adequate, but you have to pay for software with better features. I prefer the Kodak Easy share software, but that is for a different class of user.I do like the Camera Control software which lets you take photos from the PC when attached, and change the camera settings. I have taken many self-portraits this way, as well as with the self timer. To me, the software is worth the purchase price (however, Olympus cameras I have owned in the past were supplied with this type of software. Not sure if they still do.)My next purchase will be the power supply, a good bag to carry thia all around and the remote, if I can find it.  It seems to be out of stock everywhere.I cannot say enough about this camera. This has to be one of the best investments I've ever made in electronic goods. I have a camera that I can use now, and in the future when I perfect my hobby.  I would HIGHLY reccomend this camera to anyone who wants quality and an easy mix of ease of use and customization. You will NOT be disappointed.  I give this camera a TEN star rating!Now the questions....  Can anyone reccommend the following:1) A good sized bag with lots of room2) A lens case for my 28-105mm lens3) Any place to find the remote (NEW)4) How to keep dust off the mirror and the viewfinder monitor above the mirror, and the best way to clean it5) A good book fro an SLR newbie that fully explains all settings/terms/etc.  For me, one of the dummy series might do ;)", "Date": "February 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "best investment in a long time", "Author": "L.

I use the 70-300mm VR zoom lens with it and get great results.  The images come out true to life with few anomolies or distortions.  The shutter release is positive and professional feeling.  Focus is accurate and fast (of course the lens is important here).  The D50 fills an important gap between old world DSLR and modern: It has an iternal focus motor so older style lenses work perfectly.  It uses an SD card instead of the clunky old CF.  And while the D70 is considered more professional, the D50 corrects for sensor anomilies the D70 doesn't.Some things you may want consider:  The LCD is only 2\", compared to 2.5\" on most newer models.  It is somewhat slower in processing, formating, direct downloads, etc.  The number of sensor pixels is low (6.1MP) compared with newer models (8-10MP).  The viewfinder doesn't see the entire frame.  However, the viewfinder is bright enough for manual focusing, and a green light indicates optimum focus in the viewfinder when manual focusing.  The lowest ISO is 200 (instead of 100 on most models).  However, noise at higher ISOs is low compared with many cameras, and I regularly use 400 and even 800.The D50 feels solid!

Yes, it has being replaced by the Nikon D40(x) line. However, take this into consideration; when it comes to Single-Lens-Reflex systems, one main component that matters most is the quality of the lens, and the versatility of the body to handle the lens.The Nikon D40 just don't have that ability auto-focus with legacy lenses unless they have intergraded, coreless focus motor build-in (AF-I or AF-S). Think of it this way, the next Nikon model that presently has the ability to use this old legacy of lens is the Nikon D80 (making it and advanced feature).These lens have an established reputation of being durable, tack sharp, versatile, and all around excellent optics. Although I don't believe that film SLR will be obsolete anytime soon, the growth of DSRL and compatible DX lenses will take away some of the demands for these old lenses, providing you with bargain prices, such as the standard 50mm f1.8 which you can get for about $100. This lens one of the best you can ever get for your Nikon digital or film and although fully-functional on the Nikon D50, I will not auto focus on D40(x)).In conclusion, I believe that if you buy the Nikon D40, and you improved as a photographer, you may feel necessary to upgrade to a more advanced body. If you get a Nikon D50, your focus will be on new lenses. Personally, the ideal starter kit is: Nikon D50, 2G fast SD card, Sigma 10-20mm, Nikon 18-200 VR f3.5-5.6, the Nikon 50mm f1.8 to compensate low light conditions due to the wonderful f1.8, and a Nikon SB-600 flashlight.Beware, the SLR system of photography is highly addictive, and you will be tented to purchase a great amount of accessories to complement your system.", "Date": "April 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Matthew Mitgang", "ReviewID": "R9S2KDPG2SZIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my D50 in november 2005 with the kit lens and I love it. I use it for sport photographt so the slow burst speed is disapointing. Otherwise this camera is excelent. I have used both the D70s and D50 and they are very similar. One glaring flaw is the lack of Comander Mode when using speedlights wirelessly. This camera has very low noise. At ISO 1600, the D50 has less noise than the Canon Digital Rebel XT at ISO 200. That is amazing and very nice for shooting in poorly lit gyms.", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "A good but dated camera", "Author": "Scott Peterson \"I.T.

It's reliable and simple to use, and unlike the very newest Nikon cameras (D40, D60, etc.)  It will focus with the older screw drive autofocus lenses.  It will not meter with manual focus lenses, and that for me was a bit of a letdown since even the lowliest Canon can do that.It's max ISO is 1600 and even today the noise level is really good, the image looking more like film grain.  At ISO 200 it's noiseless and great.  The burst speed is about 2.5 frames per second.  This gives you 3 frames for RAW and non-stop for JPEG. In general if you're an amateur, snapshot traveler, or need a second SLR as a backup this is a good choice.The battery is a slightly older style than the newer Nikons, and as far as I know isn't used in any of the new ones, so it will eventually go out of production.  The card slot is SD only (2GB or less) which was all they had at the time, and the older SD cards have been phased out for SDHC.  There were a few aftermarket battery grips made, but to be honest aside from making a larger handhold they weren't good for much.The picture quality is very good with two exceptions.  I've noticed in scenes with mixed lighting, such as fluorescent and daylight, that the camera will get confused and expose the fluorescent as light blue.  I've also seen in bright cloudy skies the highlights get all blown out.  In winter scenes this makes an extra cold effect, but in normal weather it doesn't look right.This camera is also infrared sensitive, and can take pictures with just a filter slapped on.  I've since converted mine to a permanent infrared and converted a second one as a \"full-spectrum\" with only a clear glass filter.Overall this has been a very reliable camera for me, and in a pinch it could still do most of what I need.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Erika Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R3B0BCCJ30SET3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have waited years for this camera to be developed and come down to a price that is affordable.

I also wanted a camera that would allow me to use my old Nikon lenses.  This camera is exactly what I was waiting for.  It has the features that users expect from modern SLR cameras, like auto-exposure and auto-focus, as well as the ability to make any and all settings yourself.  It has a number of pre-set exposure settings, like sports, night portraits, and close ups.  You compose the picture through the view finder.  As with other digital cameras, you can review photos as soon as you take them, or later, and delete any that you don't want.  The camera works with standard SD cards.  With high resolution images, I can fit 567 photos on a 2G card.  The camera comes with a rechargeable battery.  I just charged mine for the first time, after approximately 500 photos, and the battery was simply low, not dead.

For what we used it for, it seemed to get the job done.  I decided to go ahead and purchase our first DSLR and stuck with the Nikon line, as that is what we have had in the past.  Also for the Nikon reputation.Wow.  The major difference from 1.3 MP to this just blew us away.  Before, the pictures always had a grainy look to them.  With this camera, even a novice who has no idea what they are doing can still take excellent photos.  There are so many features that this camera offers.  Up until a few weeks ago, I had been shooting mainly in Auto mode.  With some quick lessons from an experienced photographer, I gradually began shooting in manual mode.  This past weekend I took photos of our friends wedding.  I was really nervous, considering I had never done this before and was worried I would screw up.  Everyone loved the photos.  I took a portable printer with us and printed one of the bride/groom poses and placed it on the table in a frame by the wedding cake at the reception.  It got a lot of compliments.  Of course, I can see some problems in the photo, but no one else did.Anyway, I would highly recommend this camera for anyone getting into the DSLR line of cameras.  As I said before, even the most novice of photographers can take some excellent photos with this camera.

While the MPs on it are low compared to cameras in recent years, I've never felt the need to upgrade because nothing I'm doing requires any more resolution. Most of the photos I take are family or vacation photos, which I then resize for display on my computer or TV. The images shot by the camera are at a resolution that needs to be reduced for either of those purposes, so there is really no need for it to be greater.As has been true with all high end cameras for a really long time now, this camera is smarter than all but a small number of photographers. Except for very unique circumstances, its just going to get the focus and the exposure right.The batteries will last for all day sessions of photo shooting while we are at family gatherings or vacation visits, and the memory cards have the capacity for literally hundreds of pictures. You can set the camera to emulate any film speed if conditions are not quite right for \"normal\" settings.For anyone still for whatever reason still using film in this day and age, you are missing out. With a digital camera with this capacity storage, you can take as many pictures as you wish, making sure you get a good variety of any scene to choose from, and increasing your chances of having the shot you envisioned in there somewhere. This camera was much more expensive when I bought it than it is now, and it didn't take long to pay for itself just in the film and development costs I no longer had to incur.I've always been happy with Nikon, and this could well be the last camera I'll ever feel the need to own.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best Nikon DSLR for newbies", "Author": "D.

And I still use it with pleasure. But this is the digital age after all, and after my wonderful 4-star (I loved it, but that toggle switch in the back is its Achille's heel!!) Fuji A340 digital camera bit the dust, I decided to bite the bullet, spend some $$ and get a Nikon digital camera.Based on what I read about it, the D50 was a good choice for me -- I have been exhibiting my photos on an off for years, enjoy being able to switch from Auto to Manual mode, and as an artist and Nikon afficionado, I decided that I'd be comfortable with this camera, and I was NOT wrong!!The 28-80mm Zoom lens gives me what I want -- flexibility and a good depth of field. The camera, lightweight and well-balanced, fits my hand and its ergonomics are stellar -- I can reach every function button with relative ease.The many and versatile functions on this camera are as numerous as the stars in the sky -- I am forever reading the owner's manual, but each time I do, I learn a bit more.My only complaint (and this seems to be a universal one as far as most digital cameras are concerned) is the short but noticeable lag between pressing the shutter and the actual recording of the photo -- fast \"action shots\" can be comppromised this way, without a good bit of pre-planning, and the recording of spontaneous shots could be missed by a fraction of a second.Carrying an extra memory card as well as an extra,pre-charged battery is a must.The Nikon D50 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera with 28-80mm f3.3-5.6G AF Nikkor Zoom Lens camera is a pleasure to own and use.

So long story short, I was in desperate need of and long overdue for some more control over my picture taking and I found it in the Nikon D50.Like so many others (looking for a good entry-level DSLR camera) probably have, I easily narrowed my selection down to the Canon (Digital Rebel) 350 and the Nikon D50... I didn't need more than 6MP, really, since that's plenty to produce a very nice looking 13x19 print and how often are we going bigger than that, right?  After many hours of searching online and reading user reviews and visiting local electronics stores and generally learning these cameras inside and out before purchasing, I came to the conclusion that they're pretty damn similar.  The primary reason that I leaned toward and eventually purchased the Nikon is because it just \"felt better.\"  A little heavier, perhaps... I think it just felt like a very well-built camera and was very comfortable in my hands - which is important.  This is also the reason that I went with the D50 over the D40 -- I actually appreciate the fact that the D50 is a little bigger that its newer D40 counterpart.Anyway - I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is new to DSLR or is making the move from SLR to DSLR... The menus are very intuitive and user friendly - Even for a guy who has been using Canons for a while.  The photo quality is outstanding - I've already blown-up, framed, and hung a few B&Ws; around the house.

Cum", "ReviewID": "R15ENCYS02YQF9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a photographer, but I enjoy taking good pictures. I never had a digital SLR before; the camera I had before the D50 was a Nikon Coolpix (a compact one). I thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro. I realized that it was even better than what I expected (maybe because I was coming from a Nikon Coolpix). The colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good.The D50 is among the cheapest digital SLR's, and, at the same time, it is a very serious product. I don't think the D50 is much inferior to the Canon Rebel, even if the Canon has 2 more megapixels of resolution. I used both the D50 (which I own) and the Rebel (at my school) and I think the D50 feels much more like a \"pro camera\" when you hold it in your hands, while the Rebel feels more like a toy.The lenses provided in the package are good, but are basic. According to me the 18-55 is better than the 28-80, but I think I should have bought the 55-200 as well: 18 to 200 covers most of the pictures that you can take. Also the 18-135 that Nikon sells with the D80 looks good to me, but they don't make a kit with those lenses for the D50.The last thing that really amazes me is the .NEF format (Nikon's RAW format). It is impressive how quickly you can improve a .NEF picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse.If you want a good camera, and you don't want to spend too much money for it I think this is the best choice.", "Date": "November 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Milestone in Digital Photography", "Author": "Luc De Jaeger", "ReviewID": "R11FOA9NLM8MS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I bought the Nikon D50 with kit lens I've done a most extensive research in finding the \"best\" dslr at the moment. Most websites and forums in Dutch, German and English discussed about the Canon-Nikon dilemma. Something I went through too. My further research could be narrowed down between the Nikon D50 or D70s and the Canon 350D/Rebel.After some months of reading any possible review about these cams I decided to go for the Nikon D50.First of all, it was less expensive (though it seemed to miss some features that the Canon or Nikon D70s had but that I considered to be of minor importance to me).Then there were the professional reviews which made the decision not easy. Professional reviewers very often analyse the technical side of the camera in studio photography. Often the more practical side is missing.Then there were the consumer reviews. The majority of these reviews seemed to be more in favor of the (newer) D50.Also, the Nikon D50 has won the DIWA Gold award for excellent value for money AND the DIWA Platinum award for the BEST Digital Camera System. Moreover, this dslr also won the TIPA 2006 best entry dslr entry level award. While these awards are not THAT significant they DO point to a very reliable system.Then there was the lens choice: going for the kit lens or the 18-70 or 18-200 VR lenses. As I could not afford the other lenses for the moment I sticked to the 18-55 mm kit lens and will, eventually when I have the money (and when the lens is available again!), buy the telezoom 18-200 mm VRII lens.The 18-55mm kit lens is the best entry level lens you can imagine. EVERY lens has some cons, but this lens does the job very very well. So, even if you want another lens and would like to buy the D50, know that the D50 body alone is hard to find. Don't lose your time and go for the D50 with kit lens. You can upgrade later on!I rave about this top-notch built dslr. The only cons I found is that you have to buy a SD-card separately (it does not come with the camera) and the ML-L3 remote controller (which is VERY handy and works perfectly) could be part of the kit (you should buy it with the camera!).In my opinion the Nikon D50 marks a milestone in the history of the dslr! For this price it is unbeatable (even if it lacks an image stabilisator and sensor cleaning system but the image stabilisation should come from a tripod or a Nikkor VR lens and the sensor cleaning is not a real problem if you don't switch lenses that often and be careful where you do it).", "Date": "July 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Delightful Camera - But Avoid Sensor Cleaning", "Author": "OldEngineer", "ReviewID": "R11QXFKXWXKR6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did you know digital SLR cameras have a little secret?

It takes quick excellent pictures at home.  Still I wouldn't mind having the longer zoom from the D70S.If you have other camera uses in mind you may want to figure out how to buy the D50 with the lens you want.  You might even buy the D70S which one of my relatives loves.I have had the D50 for three months and find it to be an excellent camera.  I particularly liked the April 6 review here.

I had read a review in dpreview.com that the packaged lenses were OK but those interested in sharper images should seek a higher quality lens.  I also know that every time you change a lens, you risk dust getting inside the camera and onto sensor, marring every subsequent image. So I looked for a very sharp lens with a wide zoom range which will allow me to keep it on the camera from portraits to wildlife to landscapes.  There are a number out there but I settled on the Nikkor 18-200MM ED AF DX VR.  This is a fabulous lens, compact, very fast focussing and nearly distortion free.  Normally, you can't hand-hold a 200MM lens but this one has an electronic image stabilzer, allowing tack sharp hand-held images at telephoto range.  The big drawback is price: the lens cost more than the D50.  My reasoning for paying such a high price may be off-beat to some, but makes sense to me.  I think the new entry -level digital SLR's by Nikon and others are all very capable and well priced.

After reading over 100 of the reviews, I believe now my camera might be faulty.  In some of the preset modes the button is not reactive as it should be b/c there's about a 3/4 to 1 second delay...and only occasionally.MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT is about the built-in flash......it fires off but in the picture doesn't show any trace of a flash.  The flash is firing 100% of the time (I think) it's supposed to.  About 60% of the time, the picture that is taken when the flash is firing shows zero indication that there was even a flash involved.  I have checked all of the settings, done both a hard reset (twice) and several soft resets to no avail.  I know about the different flash settings for slow and rear and curtains and such but all settings I try do not change anything.  This \"phenomena\" is not confined to one or two settings; this problem occurs on every auto setting a flash can fire in.  I think it might be a timing problem internally somehow.I think if I can get these two problems squared away, I will definitely be one of the over 100 satisfied owners of the D50.Feel free to comment if you think there is something I can try to fix these problems.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Expectation to set straight for first time digital SLR owners", "Author": "Dominic M.

I develop my own C-41 negatives and print the photos using a Berkley Omega C760 color enlarger.I recently borrowed a Nikon D50 from a friend for shooting pics of my brand new baby, as I do not have sufficient flash equipment to shoot low-light indoors.  The Nikon I borrowed has the two kit lenses, 28-80 & 50-200.  The receipt still in my buddy's camera bag shows the retail paid was $1200 for the kit.What I like:- Standard DSLR features.- Nicely sized camera.- Plenty of standard connectors.What I dislike:- AF is finicky and has difficulty about half the time with finding what I am pointing at, under all metering modes, and it is very noisy.  Typical Nikon focus issues, from what I understand.- The viewfinder is tiny!  I mean, what is this?  I've had better point and shoot viewfinders than this little thing.- In full manual mode, the shutter speed is adjusted by depressing the trigger button to the first stop (for auto focusing), and using the click wheel.  This is great, but who designed this feature?  There is a learning curve here to avoid shooting the photo before you have the SS adjusted.  Horrible idea, Nikon.- The viewing screen is small, essentially only allowing for a framing check.  The screen is too small to check subtle nuances in lighting, color, contrast, etc.  The purpose of shooting digital is to be able to assess the photo immediately after it is shot; this camera fails that fundamental criterion.- The menu is difficult to navigate through.  The screens are not very intuitive, it takes searching to figure out how to adjust basic settings like type of lighting.- The focus ring on the kit lenses are not smooth at all.  Exact focus is difficult because it takes relatively considerable effort to move the ring.  I understand this is just a kit lens, but why bother having a manual focus ring if it works like complete crap?- The battery pack is charged with an external charger.  This is a pain, and it requires me to have more clutter laying around my house.Overall impression:I understand that better models are now available from Nikon, possibly with fixes to many of my listed complaints, but I am comparing the D50 to my Canon film SLR from the 90s.  When I shoot with both during photo outings, I am very impressed by the Canon, and consequently very unimpressed with the D50.  I would pay maybe $50 for a used body if I were in the market.  I wouldn't touch the kit lenses for free.  My Canon is snappy, quite, ergonomic, and knows 9/10 of the time exactly why I am focusing on, even when using the focus range setting.  The D50 is sluggish, noisy, comes with crap kit lenses, uses way too much power, has non-intuitive menu prompts, and is currently left behind by current point and shoot digitals.  Basically it's a sorry excuse for even an entry level DSLR, but makes an outstanding paper weight for my immunology homework.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good but I would have liked better control over the flash", "Author": "Per Loll \"Loll\"", "ReviewID": "R29Q84DWH4X9CE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Would have liked to be able to use the programs and be able to force the flash on for sunny outdoors portraits.
