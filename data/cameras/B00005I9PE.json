I purchased the  P30 for her and assumed that it was accessorized like my own camera.  After purchase, I realized that the camera kit DID NOT INCLUDE a rechargeable power supply or recharger.  The supplied AA batteries will only last about 2 hours under the best conditions. The batteries were shot by the time I familiarized myself with the operating manual. You can purchase an accessory kit from Sony for about $99 that includes a rechargable lithium battery, charger, and a camera case.

It comes with alkaline batteries, which the manual says you can't use to transfer files to a computer. It's hard to call the power adapter and a battery upgrade (e.g. nickel metal hydride) anything but a necessity.Left out of the reviews is a third factor which people haven't seemed to mention yet. The cameras, or perhaps just some of them, don't function properly with FRESH AA alkaline batteries. After mine quickly used up the two that came with it, I put in good fresh ones that tested well, and the camera wouldn't turn on in either record mode or moving picture mode (and would turn off if I moved into those modes from others). In playback mode, the battery indicator verified that the batteries were good. This led to emails to Sony which led to inane computer-generated responses reminding me to change the batteries. Eventually I got through to a representative on the phone who said the problem I was having was common. Got that - MANY people had the same problem. Best Buy doesn't accept the returns because Sony, wary of the problem, includes a label in the packaging saying something like \"if malfunctioning do not return to the store.\" They don't offer you your money back as part of your warranty. Now I'm stuck having to ship it to PA and hoping they return it working properly. Meanwhile I've bought Nickel MH batteries and a charger which has seemed to be a quick fix. I've sent pictures to the computer without the AC adapter that Sony indicates is mandatory.I've edited this review to add that I now believe I've purchased enough equipment to get around the power supply problem.  NiMH batteries, a charger, a 32 MB memory stick, and a USB memory stick reader all appear to make the camera fully functional.  It takes good pictures.  Still, [those dollars are] a lot to throw at a $... camera, and Sony's skeletal warranty and lack of forthrightness are troublesome.", "Date": "August 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "Sony has done it again, at an awesome price!", "Author": "\"icewind21\"", "ReviewID": "R1L6IEHPGXDTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive had a few digital cameras in the past 2 years, but none of the came to the quality and features that I wanted. Being the techno freak I am, I wanted a camera that could do anything I wanted it to. I was almost set on an Olympus when this Sony came in at my work. It was love at first site. For a bit more money I was getting a much better zoom, movie recorder and Sony quality. Needless to say, I got it on my Birthday and I could not be happier. Setting it up is incredibly easy *as most of Sony products are* and using it makes even a novice an expert with a few hours of practice. The layout of the camera is comfortable and lightweight, Easily held in one hand to take pictures. The LCD is bright and crisp and show almost no slowdown when viewing it. A very nice turn nob selects the mode on the camera, No more fiddling with menus on the LCD. The 3xoptical zoom is great when you want to get a little closer. An optional 6xdigital is there to, but the pictures turn out to fuzzy. This camera could do anything you want it to, macro shots, low light, fast action, low light, low background light, movies,clip art, clip motion, red eye reduction and more! The menus system is very straightforward, hard to screw up. Picture quality is awesome. Though sometimes a bit soft, easily rectified with the Photosuite 8.1 the camera comes with. It would be hard pressed to get a better program without spending alot of money. Installation of the USB software takes just minutes, and a full 32 meg Stick takes just 30 seconds to upload. *no more serial!*One bad side, this thing eats batteries like Joan Collins goes through makeup. I went through 6AA alkaline in 3 hours the first day. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting rechargebles, Nickel Metal Hydride perferred, this camera loves its batteries.Also, recommend getting a bigger Sony Stick, the included 4 meg only does 6 pics at highest setting, a 32meg will get you 50. *what I use*In all, I am very much enjoying this camera and taking great photos. If you interested in seeing what some look like email me at icewind@montana.com and I'll give you a link. For people who want to get into the Digital realm but want a low price for great quality, the SONY DSC-P30 is absolutely hard to beat!", "Date": "July 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Think twice before you buy!!!", "Author": "W.

Everyting everybody writes here is is true...this thing eats up batteries like you won't believe! 15 - 20 minutes per pair of batteries max.  Wow.  It's incredibly frustrating.  Then, if you want to upgrade to the Lithium battery, . . . the charger, the DC adaptor, or upgrade the memory (the 4MB is a joke) to 32MB, etc. etc  All are sold seperately.  You can't just grab some no name accesories either.  It must be ($$$$) Sony! I returned this camera in less than 12 hours after purchasing.  I won't be tethered to Sony for the rest of my life. If you want a similar camera, at the same price, that has more memory(16MB), uses RECHARGEABLE long-life Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries and includes the charger, try the FujiFilm FinePix 2600 Zoom.

The bad part is that only a 4 mb memory stick is included and when taking photos at the highest res this camera ofers you'll get abt 5 pics on the memory stick. Also get the rechargable battery the 2 AA's that came with the camera lasted me 4hrs or abt 20 pics. For the prcie and list of features you get, I don't think this camera can be beat. An additional gripe is that the memory sticks are quite pricey but once you pic up one 64 mb stick you shoud be fine.

I did a lot of research online, looking for models that were not over $300, that would work on both my PC and my MAC. I also wanted to be able to use a USB connection. After alot of searching, I was pretty sure I was going to get the Kodak with MP3 player and Video, but when I got to the store and found this Sony, I was quick to change my mind. After comparing the 2 and realizing that for only about $40 more I could have so many more features, I went for it. It has a great LCD to catch the action and has an optical as well as digital zoom. I also like the fact that it has a lens cover. It is very small and easy to hold when taking pictures. I am very disapointed, however, in the short battery life, but guess that goes along with just about any digicam. The 4mb memory stick is also pretty disapointing, but both of these things can be taken care of by buying accessories. I had no problem taking photos and I had no problem installing the drivers onto either of my computers. Pictures showed up where they were supposed to and I have already used them on a few auctions. Sony has always been good to me and I expect to get a lot of years out of this camera. Also the instruction booklet is very precise and easy to understand.

I had a limited budget of $300-400, so I wanted to get as much quality as I could for as few $$$ as possible.  Doesn't everyone?I tried out the Canon Powershot A20, Olympus, and Fuji FinePix.  All came highly-recommended and rated by consumer reports. But I saw that the Sony Cybershot also ranked in the top 5 in one report so I check it out.I was extremely impressed with the features and quality of photos taken with the Cybershot.  The price was one of the lowest too. I highly recommend trying out the cameras before you buy!  Don't just take an editor's word for it.  Picking out the right digital camera with the right look and feel is a very personal thing.The only bad thing that I can say about the Cybershot is that despite being around $100 cheaper than comparable products, you'd be well advised to take that $100 and buy Sony's lithium-ion battery and charger kit.  Alkalines last only minutes in this camera but the Stamina (Sony's Lithium-Ion battery) lasts an outstanding 90 minutes!! The camera comes with features like an MPEG movie mode for capturing short video clips (no sound), photo effects like Sephia, and photo editting (zooming, cropping, resizing) right on the camera.Another feature that I liked with the Cybershot was the freedom to take control over the shutter speed and aperature if I wanted to try some advanced photo effects.Try before you buy!

(You would need more pixels to do bigger enlargements).  It takes great pictures; is very well-featured for a camera in this range; and is well-designed and easy to use.- The 3x optical zoom is a huge plus, and will give you much better composed and better quality photos than non-zoom or digital zoom cameras.- If you like close-ups, the \"Macro\" feature will amaze you.- It's all automatic when you want to point and shoot, but allows you some control when you want it.The features and components are based on more expensive Sonys, a big plus. ...P>A few things to know up front:- All digital cameras eat batteries.  Get NiMH rechargeables rated 1700-1800 mah (cheaper and better than the Sony lithium pack for this camera).  The DSC-P30 is actually better than most in that it uses only 2AAs, and lasts a fairly long time on that.  So you can easily carry a spare set, shoot all day, and your battery worries are over.- The Sony Memory Stick format IS more expensive, but since this is a lower-resolution 1.3MP camera you need only 64 to 128mb (gives you 100-200 photos at high quality).  Unfortunate, but not enough difference to avoid this camera, as some suggest.- All digital cameras have \"shutter lag\" and longish shot to shot times.  This is one of the major adjustments new digicam owners face when they get their first camera.  The Sony DSC-P30 starts up very fast, and has a typical shot-to-shot time.- All digital cameras have trouble in low light.  The \"autofocus illuminator\" on this camera helps with that, and is rare on lower-priced cameras.- The viewfinder (used in bright light or to save battery by not using LCD) doesn't show the full picture.  It's a common problem, you can somewhat get used to it, but it's one of the few negatives for this camera.An alternative would be the Canon A10.  Less features, a little heavier (uses 4AAs), but the Compact Flash cards Canon uses are cheaper.

Well if you haven't already gotten the most common theme in all the previous reviews, here it is one more time: The battery life on this thing is unspeakably appalling!!! To sell this camera, claiming that it operates on a pair of AA batteries is like selling an 18 Wheeler with a cross country trip planned on half a pint of gas...it just won't happen!!! The camera otherwise isn't too bad. There are  a fair amount of useful features. The picture quality is good. The menu interface and controllers are very intuitive and creative. The construction and the design look handsome and sturdy. But you won't really enjoy any of that if your camera only runs for 15 mins. Heck, I bet most of the poor folks out there weren't even able to finish reading the instruction manual when the AA batteries died. This is the kind of thing that makes my blood boil! Either all the Sony Engineers instantaneously turned dumber than bricks to even suggest AA batteries as a sustained power source for a an LCD and Flash intensive device, or this is a typical Sony rip off plan. I would tend to agree with the later possibility. Selling a product with the absolute bare minimum and then charging absolutely ludicrous prices for the \"optional accessories\", which should have been included with the product to begin with is long a standing trademark of Sony. Not to mention the fact that anything and everything with the name Sony on it is already extremely expensive. The camera comes with a pair of Sony AA batteries, which die in about 15 to 20 minutes, no exaggeration what so ever! So either you need to start dating someone who works for Energizer or Duracell, or drop about a [$amount] on a Battery/Charger combo. Maybe we wouldn't have had to buy the Battery and the Recharger if Sony had at least included an AC Adapter with the package, but God forbid Sony would do that. Another thing that ticks me off is that the AC power connection on the Camera is a Sony proprietary connection. Which means that I can't just go the local Hack Shack, I am sorry, I mean  Radio Shack and buy a cheap adapter for 10 bucks, no sir, I have to buy a Sony, or a Sony compatible adapter for around [$amount]. Everything must be proprietary you see. This is of course to properly and effectively screw the customers. You gotta love Sony! Ok, so now we have a respectable amount of power supply, but guess what? With the shamefully small memory stick of 4MB that Sony included, we won't be able to snap more than a couple of pictures (never mind a video clip!!!) before memory is full. So now we must buy a higher capacity memory stick (Sony proprietary of course!), lets say we buy a 32MB Stick for about [$amount]. So now we can take a ton of pictures. But another potential problem arises as soon as you connect your camera to the computer. The USB cable is mind-numbingly short! Either Sony is assuming that every computer has a frontal USB connection or that we are all very small people! Would it have killed them to make the damn thing a bit longer so people with a USB connection in the rear of the case can at least comfortably put the camera on top of the computer case with out fear of it falling off. This is quite reminiscent of the Sony Playstation controllers that just weren't long enough to reach the living room couch without a lot of stretching. Although it's optional, one needs to spend [$amount] to [$amount] on a longer USB cable. What Sony does include with the package is a lousy, good for nothing, 2 cent video cable that most people most likely already have several of. Yes of course, before getting a better power supply, more memory, and a stable connection to my PC, my first priority really is to hook this thing up to my freakin television!!! Ridiculous!!! So a camera being sold for [$amount] dollars is actually more like [$amount]! So unless you are willing to spend the  [$amount], I would recommend waiting a bit longer until the prices of the digital cameras go down further (I am surprised they are still so unbelievably high!), or if you need one now, go with someone like Olympus or Fuji. I really haven't done a lot of research on Olympus or Fuji but in general they are a better value.  Thank God for capitalism and the spirit of competitive markets where we as consumers have the choice of  going elsewhere and finding a better value. Hope this was fun and helpful.

This was our first digital camera and we wanted mainly to take photos for viewing on the computer, posting on webpages and emailing to family.

Get the battery pack mentioned above and you will always have a spare pair ready to go when you need them.  It's a must.One complaint we read about this camera is the length of time it takes the camera to get ready between shots.  I do notice a delay that is sometimes frustrating if you are trying to take several pictures quickly in a row.  If you take action photos this is probably not a good choice.

I want to shed light on the most of the negative comments here that are really inexperienced users being unprepared.I have used an Olympus D-340L for a couple years now. I have taken innumerable shots from close-up portraits to multishot panoramas and most things in between, like action shots. Which, by the way, most digital cameras under a grand do not do well without practice. Even then it's a compromise. So I suppose that is the first truth.Second is battery life. No AA batteries will last long in ANY product with an LCD display. Especially when there is also a flash and electronic components that can really drain. The solution, as recommended by some here is rechargables.  Recharagbles often make sense for home-centered products. If you plan to hit the road, bring a set of Alkalines for emergencies. Your other option, like many 35mm film cameras, is non-rechargable lithiums. I use this method and have found it is economical.Truth three is AC adapters. So far as I have seen, all digital cameras require a proprietary AC power adapter that is thirty to sixty extra dollars. It's a plain fact, unfortunate but true. Two months after the camera I got the adapter and since then ALWAYS use it during the slow (serial, not USB, boohoo) camera to PC transfer.Truth four is memory/photo storage. Here's the deal: you get what you pay for. Two years ago, my 340L was rated number one by Consumer Reports, came with a 4MB SmartMedia card, and was about four hundred dollars. That was a good value for an relatively exceptional \"basic\" digital camera at the time. The P30 would be a better value with 8MB. But it has features that others do not at this price.  So this camera's compromise is less included storage. However, you can get a wide angle lens for about fifty bucks, where others are over a hundred, if at all.So, THE TRUTH IS: You are paying comparitively less, but also getting the mentioned compromises, all of which can be overcome. Albeit with a little, and sometimes not, dinero.So there it is. I hope it helps you.Happy Shooting!", "Date": "February 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "Another winner from Sony", "Author": "Jacqueline M.

The only problem I can think of is that the delay is pretty long.  This camera is no good for quick pictures, but I've worked around it.  I also would recommend a memory stick upgrade.  The one that comes with it only holds about 10 pictures.  That's ok at home but over seas you have to have more memory.  For a first time digital camera buyer, I most diffently recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent Digital Camera for the Amateur Photographer", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1I5T3IVTQQVUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera, The picture quality is above my expecations for 1.3mp, It is packed with tons of features (Black & White, and other special effects, lets me manually adjust settings), I feel like a pro with this camera, the lens gets noticed, it looks like the ones the pros are using. Batteries arent a nightmare if you have atleast 4 Rechargable NiMh Batteries on hand, I would also recommend getting atleast a 32mb memory stick, it will hold about 50 pictures in the highest resolution, also get a case to protect your investment. The movie mode is cool, although I havent had a chance to really use it very much. Use Twilight Mode only with a tripod because even a little shake from your hands will cause it to be blurry in Twilight Mode.

(They instructions clearly say NOT to do it with only batteries, but there is no transformer included.) Also no carrying case. Sony appears to be going for an \"aftermarket\" here. I would not recommend this to anyone without these caveats.Just adding a bit. 1. I did not experience the problems that they guy did when putting in fresh batteries. I already had niMH's and a charger, but went ahead and paid ... for Sony's \"power package\". 2. The lithium batteries make a world of difference. Still I resent the fact that the transformer is something you need and Sony didn't include it. The real price ... Not a bargain.

Using the best resolution it offers in normal light conditions, I've had perfect quality prints developed. You can't tell that they were taken with a digital camera - at least I can't and that's enough for me. :) Some minor problems do occur, though: if there's not enough light (for instance indoors) without the flash the picture becomes grainy. Also, it takes some time till it clicks. And a lot of pics were blurry when i used it in a party with a lot of flashing coloured lights around - but I guess that's not everyday use. :)As for the battery: I was surprised to read about these problems. I have inexpensive rechargable batteries and they last for a reasonably long period of time. I've never had a problem with them.I really like this camera, with the optical zoom and other features.

High points are:-3x OPTICAL zoom (you almost NEVER find this feature in any camera [in this price range])-excellent auto-focus (not focus-free like many in this price range) and flash pictures-Crisp backlit LCD viewfinder-PRICE!!!The only caveats are that sony's accessories are a bit more expensive than the competition, but you can get around that by using lexar or sandisk brand memory sticks (which work perfectly), and using NiMH 1600MaH+ batteries.

A few quibbles I have are the fact that Sony addons (like additional memory cards and card readers) are Sony-specific and are thus very expensive in comparison to less exclusive brands.  I would expect to buy about $50-100 in addons while buying the camera.  The angle that one holds the camera is a bit awkward as well.  Instead of putting it in the cradle of your palms, one puts it in the cradle of your index finger and thumb in somewhat of a L fashion on both sides.  Theres a long lapse between clicking the shoot button to actually taking the shot when the camera is set in autofocus making it somewhat hard to capture split second events or motion although one could always turn this autofocus feature off.On  the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised that the camera doesnt seems to eat up battery time as much as I expected.  I'm slightly disappointed with the zoom of the camera in that its a bit lacking but this may be a problem with all 3X digital zoom cameras.  I would definitely have to say that the camera is not the best for its money if you consider the addons (when compared to the A10) but it gives quite good pictures none-the-less which is, after all, the whole point; hence I gave it 4 stars.", "Date": "July 1, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good little Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1I2G8Y0JHYY92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my girlfriend.
