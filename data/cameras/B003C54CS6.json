We tested a Polaroid i1437TC (Titanium) SN M1XXXXXXXXXXXX159 model, camera only. For this test we used AA Rechargeable NickelMetalHydride (NiMH) batteries and new AA Alkaline batteries. The i1437TC has a feature to adjust battery types. The rechargeable NiMH batteries were charged up however only lasted 24 hours during our camera test on a setting for Alkaline battery and only 8 hours on a setting for NiMH battery. The battery winner: On the plus side the new Alkaline batteries kept running through 72 hours testing and continue to be reliable. We set the adjust battery type to Alkaline and recommend this to be the standard setting. Win for battery use.We then tested the 14MP resolution and quality features. The resolution can be set from 14MP, (12MP) High Resolution Prints, 8MP, 3MP, HDTV setting, and VGA (email). The quality can be set to Normal, Fine, and Superfine. All resolution and quality settings worked. Keep in mind that high resolution and quality use more memory for storage. The i1437TC has 64mb internal memory with SD card for added storage (SD card sold separately). We installed an 8 GB SD card for the test. With the 14MP setting only 72 images were able to be saved. By comparison, with the VGA setting we shot 289 images and could have shot up to 684 images. Acceptable for image storage use.There is a feature for anti-shake image stabilization. This works fine. Win for anti-shake image stabilization.There is a 3x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. This worked as indicated for a passable zoom feature, though this is less than the new standard.We reviewed and tested the scene settings which met our expectations.We then tested the video feature. The video retention was limited from storage use and the audio was also acceptable when considering quick movies for the internet.Overall we give the i1437TC 4 stars for highest quality and resolution for a point and shoot, variable image allocation compared to similar cameras, reliable AA battery use, Anti-shake image stabilization, passing zoom, normal scene settings and internet quality video/audio.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's an okay basic camera.", "Author": "Steven Castellano", "ReviewID": "R2X7OLCOP1I91R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Polaroid i1437 camera is good for basic users who just need an easy point-and-shoot camera that takes decent pictures. Here are the pros and cons:Pro - The camera is simple to use.  It has a rather large 2.7 inch LCD display that's bright and clear.  The menus are easy to navigate.  The face-detection and smile-detection features work well.  The 14 megapixel sensor takes good (not great) pictures with good color.  The camera is small, light and easy to carry and hold.  Many different scene settings.  It's easy to hook the camera to the computer to import photos and it works with my iMac and my PC.  You don't have to remove the batteries to swap out the SD card.  Can manually set shutter speed and/or aperture.  The camera is light, but feels fairly solid and well-built.Con - Takes a long time to focus and the focusing often fails in lower light situations.  The camera eats batteries (I get about 50-75 shots per set of AA batteries.  I started using rechargeables and it's a bit better with them).  The \"image stabilization\" merely ups the ISO to compensate for low light, resulting in noisy pictures. 3X optical zoom is a bit skimpy.Overall, it's a good basic camera for taking pictures in good light situations.  It doesn't perform too well in less than perfect lighting and the focus is slow and sometimes inaccurate, but for the price, it's a nice little camera with some nice features and some drawbacks.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "bought 2 of these cameras within 7 months of each other", "Author": "Tina Pahls", "ReviewID": "R3G0TP1MR25PG9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will admit I love the photos this camera takes. If you love to take photos this camera sucks battery power, however the video resolution is amazing. I had a problem with the part that held my batteries in and it would actually kill my batteries quicker. I have had 2 of the same camera's as I loved my first one and it was a 12 megapixel this is a 14 and it was not as good as the 12. It has many mechanical flaws especially in sports mode.

We drive through some beautiful countryside, and the camera was GREAT taking pictures as we zoomed past landmarks. We also saw beaches, forests, mountaintops, sunsets, lakes, and indoor games of Monopoly lit by kerosene lantern. In ALL of these situations, my new camera was a champ! It's so easy to use, and I really love it! One word of advice, do invest in the non-alkaline batteries or rechargables. It lasted a whole 10 days, but I had to replace the batteries for our next 5 day trip.

AVOID.", "Author": "Chip from Woodbury, NJ", "ReviewID": "R2GRXM06DGMNC1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Prior bad review nails it.  I put a \"one\" star because I don't want people making the same mistake of ignoring these negative reviews!I have five other digital cameras.  Never have I seen a camera reject batteries like this.I tested this on new alkalines, and two different types of nihm's.  There is no way you should only get only about 25 pictures from a camera using 2 AAs.  I have an Olympus and Canon that take AA's. As for the Canon, I didn't have to charge them again during a whole week's vacation.But to clarify, this doesn't \"eat\" batteries.  It does NOT wear them out.  You never get that far.Batteries tested after the camera rejects them shows them ALMOST fully charged.I've seen this exact same behavior before in a cheap MP3 player.For some reason, it requires absolutely fully charged, topped off batteries or it shuts off.Don't buy a headache.IMPORTANT SECOND NOTE:WHILE THE DESCRIPTION MAY NOT SAY SO, THIS COMES PACKAGED IN A \"BLISTER\" PACK.

Schaller", "ReviewID": "R2J71AIV7V565Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd give the Polaroid i1437 digital point and shoot camera, 3.5 out of 5 stars.I have the older, non-Titanium model, which has only enough internal memory for about 6 pictures at maximum resolution and fineness. You upgrade that memory with an SD card.The i1437 is a good and durable camera that has some very notable limitations due to its very small CCD sensor.My work cooler opened and submerged it in water. It was soaking for at least 30 minutes before I discovered what had happened. I did what I could to dry it out while at work, then covered it in rice over night and it works well enough since then, minus a vapor spot inside the lens (which cleared up) and stickiness in the lens cover opening (which got better, but never went away).The camera, even barring my abuse of it, produces excellent images with a high amount of fine detail.But it has serious limitations.The camera itself (in the scene settings) tells you not to exceed prints larger than 16\" x 24\". My guess is that this limitation is due to electronic \"noise\", which shows up in some images, especially darker images and images where you tweak saturation. This becomes more severe as you increase the size of your prints.You can probably surpass this limit with images that are very bright, but tread this ground at your own risk.What is \"noise\"? It often shows up randomly in your prints as pinpricks of \"light\". They may almost look like highlights, except invariably harsh and ugly.This is, as with so much of this camera's shortcomings, due to the limitations of the tiny image sensor.The Polaroid i1437 is slow, especially in Sports mode. It is so slow that I'm not sure why they bothered to include a Sports mode at all.It performs horribly in low-light situations, including in situations where the lighting doesn't really seem all that bad. This is, again, due to the small sensor size.What do I mean by \"small sensor\"? I believe it is an \"ultra compact\" camera sensor, which measures 5.27mm X 3.96mm. It may also be called a 1/4\" sensor (because the diagonal measure equals approximately 1/4\").Polaroid is religious in its omission of camera sensor sizes on its product pages. That fact plus the performance issues I note in this review lead me to believe that Polaroid habitually goes on the cheap in this area. Which is fine. There's a reason these cameras are relatively inexpensive.But, it would be helpful if we were able to learn this information upfront, so we can make informed choices and so we can make an apples to apples comparison vs other cameras (say, when we're looking to upgrade from our reliable but under-performing i1437, as I am.).Onward.With this sensor, the type of lighting seems to be as important the amount of light. The i1437 performs very well in overcast conditions, including heavy overcast, but very poorly when a scene is lit by incandescent bulbs.In addition to general poor performance in incandescent lighting, the amount of electronic noise jumps way up in any scene lit with incandescent bulbs, particularly in shadowed areas but in the overall image, too.Color saturation and fidelity is VERY low (again, caused by the small sensor size), but actually seem to increase in overcast lighting.The anti-shake feature is of minimal usefulness with the lens at its default \"wide angle\" position. It's of no usefulness at all if you zoom the lens out even the smallest amount.Using the digital zoom AT ALL, causes immediate and severe pixelation of all images shot using it.It is nearly impossible to shoot a picture that doesn't have a very long depth of field. This happens even in Portrait mode, which is specifically designed to have a shallow depth of field. If you're guessing that this is an effect of the small sensor size coupled with the wide angle of the lens, you're right.But if, like me, you take a lot of pictures, can't afford a better point and shoot, sell some of your pictures and don't have the ability to carry a better camera (DSLR) even if you could afford it, then this is a good stopgap until you can upgrade.It's also fantastic if all you take is selfies or other shots of generally unimportant subject matter for no other purpose but to share it with friends or on social media.As for complaints about it \"eating batteries\". The camera comes with separate settings for rechargeable, alkaline and lithium batteries. Make sure yours is set to whichever type you're using and there should be no problem. I get 250 350 shots out of a quality set of alkalines. On my first set of lithiums I shot between 2,200 and 2,500 images, many with flash, and I had no *problems.*Note: One day soon after I crossed the 1,000 image threshold on the Ultimate lithium batteries I tried out (which make the claim of lasting \"up to\" 9X longer than alkaline batteries) within a single hour I took at least 50 shots that required flash. The camera finally told me, \"Hey, you wanna use flash? How 'bout this? How's about you go screw yourself? Huh? Wadda ya think a dat?\" And I was certain I'd have to change batteries. But, no.
