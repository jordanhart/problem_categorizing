I returned it and was sent a replacement.  The replacement works fine except for the tilt viewing screen which blanks out often.  When in the untilted position it works fine; just when using the tilt the problem occurs.  Hopefully, the contact problem will go away soon (which it didn't on a previous camera I owned), and all will be fine.  If not I'll send this one back or expect FUJI to fix it.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$659.95", "Features": "16-megapixel EXR-CMOS sensor deliver amazing pictures in fast-shooting and low-light situations.\nCapture up to 11 frames/second at 8-megapixel resolution.
