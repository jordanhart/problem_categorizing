I have had an ELPH Canon for 5 years before this on and that is why I got this one.  I was surprised there was no CD-ROM for installation but went to the web site and downloaded  It is small Compact and takes great pictures.

Those are cheap so just order a couple better brands if you buy this camera. The pictures are excellent quality. There's a lot of different settings for different effects. The auto actually adjusts for night shots without having to change anything. I charged the battery before I went on vacation for a week, took almost 500 pictures plus 4-5 videos and been taking pictures and video since I've been home and the battery only lost 2 bars. Hooked up to my PC with no issues and works great with my Kodak photo printer. It is small, the case is padded a bit and soft inside. I dropped it once on the pavement and no dents, no damage. There's still a lot I haven't discovered with it so missed a few things.Basically, if you want a compact camera that takes great shots and does so much more, buy it, I highly recommend this Canon.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy!", "Author": "Donna Hutchins", "ReviewID": "RTTC3I83ZGYSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am pleased with this purchase.

(I bought a kit just like this in pink a few years ago and it was stolen.(I had the MANUAL in the case for reference.) The charger was plugged in at home from charging the extra battery so they didn't get THAT at least!Ha! :/ )Actually, IT came with a manual in English AND Spanish! This one? Just a sheet telling you how to install the battery, memory card, you know, the BASICS, and at the top of this sheet is their website where you have to DOWNLOAD IT AND PRINT IT YOURSELF! (OK seems like a small thing these days but I want a manual I can carry. On the upside, the manuals are available in a plethora of languages.) Also, I (obviously naively) thought in these days of social networking the USB cable you need to transfer your pics onto your computer would be included. Nope. However, you can conveniently buy at the Canon website (provided to get your manual) for $19.95 PLUS S & H! OR you can use this link to get the same thing (but NOT made by Canon) right here at Amazon for $5.75 + 4.99 S & H! PLUS it has a 5 star satisfaction rating! dCables Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 IS USB Cable - USB Computer Cord for PowerShot ELPH 115 ISIf you have one of these cameras, they are amazing, aren't they?

I also have a samsung galaxy 3 phone that I had been using to take pictures at spur of the moment occasions. I was looking for a small camera that still had good resolution/image quality for when I'm on the go with my kids or family. I thought this would fit the bill. It came quickly and packaged well. Out of the box the battery does need to be charged overnight before using. Once it was charged and ready to go, I found the camera to be easy to hold and use. The size is just right for on the go. I got it in blue and was pleased with the color and the case that it came with. It fit perfect in my smaller purses and the side pocket of my diaper bag. What did it for me though was the picture quality. I expected more from Canon, having owned an older version of the Canon PowerShot. For 16 MP, the image quality is comparable to that of my Samsung Galaxy 3 phone. I took pictures at a family birthday party indoors with the camera and my phone and could not tell a difference in the quality with both indoor and outdoor lighting. Perhaps it may be because I've gotten spoiled with my dslr and I expect crisp images when I take pictures, especially with Canon's image stabilizer. If you're looking images with a high resolution that you could print enlargements with, this camera will do the job, but don't expect superior quality in those images. In the end, I returned the camera and I'm going to stick with my camera phone in the mean time.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price!", "Author": "Bonnee Pierson", "ReviewID": "R2RXKWXGPT4BRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a camera to take pictures of my products for sale online and I was amazed at the quality of the photos as well as how easy it is to carry and use.

Intuitive operation, idiot proof camera, does great close-ups, crisp pictures, great videos.  I took pictures of kids, hardly any blurred ones.  I did them on automatic, and to me it is easier to just crop the pictures to get a close up then trying to zoom in and frame it in right.  That way avoid the blurs.  I took great close-ups of flowers with the macro function.  Zoom is a bit trickier, I need to use tripod maybe.  I took videos, they turned out pretty good, sound quality surprisingly good.  I just downloaded the on-line manual (not included with camera).  So now I am going to figure out how to do various effects, and can try the more manual settings too.
