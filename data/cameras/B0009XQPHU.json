Having been an SLR fan, I was shocked to find the quality and shocked to discover a new 'feature' in Digital cameras - 'Shutter Lag'.This is very apparent when you use your digital camera in night times, shoot a picture and shake your camera a bit (either deliberately or normal hand jitter as it usually happens) - and your picture looks like a non-descript brush work.This experience almost made me think that good digital cameras are atleast another 2-3 years away - until I discovered Panasonic and Casio.  Panasonic incorporates a mechanical gyroscope to offset the hand jitter and Casio incorporates a DSP based jitter compensation.Deciding between Panasonic and Casio was a tough one.  Some Panasonic cameras come with leica lens, which made them very attractive, but at the same time, they seemed to be bulky.I weighed my chances and went with the Casio and not at all disappointed.Another test which you can do for your camera is to shoot the sky along with a building in the foreground, the colors of the building often get diffused into the sky making the sky white and not blue as it usually is.  Casio scored very well on this - the sky was really blue !+ve:(1) Compact (not ultra compact)(2) Runs on AA batteries(3) Ultra bright large LCD Screen(4) Optical view finder (Panasonic lacks this)(5) Good combination of mechanical and digital controls  (I've seen cameras that have 100% menu driven controls  which require you to go through cascading menus to do even the simplest tasks)(6) And the best part:  Excellent picture quality, compared it  with the quality of pictures in Sony Cybershot and Casio is far more superior.  The colour contrast is excellent.(7) Good sky color contrast (see my test above)(8) Excellent focussing, I will soon upload some photos of my cat the focussing is very fast and very clear(9) Image preview sorted by Date, looks like a calender - very useful-ve:(1) Not very happy with the battery life, but who cares, they are AA, I might buy some rechargaeble ones soon.(2) Wish if the optical view finder was a little biggerOverall, I am very happy with this camera, been with me for 1 week, will update my review if I find anything good or bad in this.BTW, Target carries some excellent camera bags for as little as $7, no need to spend a fortune on them.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent Digital Camera - especially for the price", "Author": "Michael \"Creative Guru\"", "ReviewID": "R1AIEOQZCCB5AO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this beauty after many months of research.  Essentially, this is comparable to the ex-500 in most aspects with the exception of storage capacity (pics and movie minutes.)  The differences were not huge and, since I was going to purchase a 1gig SD card, the difference became minimal.  Add to that the price difference and you can see why I went this route instead.Once you open the box you can tell Casio has put quality into this item.  It feels solid despite it's thin size.  This is not the thinest camera out there but it is small, fits easily into my pocket and very durable.  Casio provides an \"overview\" manual in booklet form and that gets you up and running.  I am the type that reads everything before I use it and I found the electronic pdf manual very helpful.  You can point and shoot out of the box, but you'll need the electronic manual to really understand how to manipulate the settings to your desire.I took a dozen shots over the Thanksgiving holiday and easily downloaded them to my computer thanks to the included USB cable (no software needed for my MAC) Although it comes bundled with a photo storage, adjustment program,  I use photoshop and probably won't bother with their program.  It is straightforward and easy enough to use, but doesn't come close to photoshop.  Anyway, the photos came out great.  I used the 'fine quality' setting and I didn't need to touch up the photos at all.  The quality was excellent (and I used their auto settings) and I could probably blow these up to 11x14's if I wanted.There are nice features like anti-shake capabity and, if you ever have seen pictures from others with out-of-focus people, this feature should be nice to have.  It has a quick shutter feature, allowing you to bypass the autofocus and instantly capture the shot in front of you.  The start up time is incredibly fast and almost takes you by surprise.  Best of all, there is no lag between snapping the picture and capturing the image.  That can be a huge problem with other cameras and definitely something you should consider.  This camera has other nice features like filters, auto-timers, etc.To summarize, this is a nice, durable, feature-loaded camera with 7.2 mega pixels with excellent quality results.  Amazon shipped it very quickly and did not disappoint.  You should consider this one!", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Wow, What a Surprise", "Author": "Brian M.

I shopped carefully, reading dozens of on-line reviews for digital cameras and even tried out a couple of cameras in \"big box\"stores. Even though this new camera had no reviews, I was impressed by its specifications and bought one to \"kick its tires\".I have now have taken about 20 photos in different light settings, ranging from bright sun, to dim indoor light, sunset, and the two 80 watt light-bulbs in my living room.Wow, I am extremely impressed. The colors are vivid and life-like, and I have yet to take a blurry picture. I also took some photos in retro and illustration mode with stunning results.I also shot several minutes of really clear AVI video with great sound quality. Another plus is that it uses regular AA batteries that seem to last forever (though I will buy rechargeable ones)This camera is small, lightweight, has a large LCD screen and is great for beginners or more advanced users.On the down side, I did not like the photo software that came with it, preferring to use Photo-Suite. The  basic reference manual that comes with it is a ridiculous joke, totally useless. I will need to print out the full version from the CD. I am really impressed and highly recommend this camera.

I have yet to take a bad picture with this thing.The quality is awesome. At 7.2 MP, I can zoom in to see my nose hairs.It also has a \"Best Shot\" mode that allows you to pick the kind of picture you want to take from a list of samples (Night Shot, Portrait, etc.). You choose the type of shot, then snap the picture - that's it! Of course, you don't have to use the \"Best Shot\" mode at all (we don't most of the time).I also love that it's about the size of a deck of cards, yet has a nice 2\" LCD display.

Would recommend.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good All Arounder", "Author": "Capt RB", "ReviewID": "R2Q8SU9HWZQIG0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The new Casio EX-Z120 is an interesting little number. Having previously owned and reviewed the excellent Pentax Optio S5i I was curious to see if this would make a worthy replacement. Unlike the Pentax, the 120 has higher resolution and a better movie mode. So here's what you need to know.Ergonomics: The 120 is small, about the size of an Altoids box, but thicker than some other subcompacts available. This exra beef is probably due to the fact that it takes 2 standard AA batteries. I can't tell you how much better this is since proprietary batteries are expensive (You'll always need to buy at least one more). With AA's you're really unlikely to be caught with a dead camera. A 4 pack of rechargeable's will seal the deal. I got over a 120 shots and some movies on one set of Panasonic rechargeable's. The Controls of the camera are tiny, but fairly easy to operate. Menu's are instantly obvious, just like the Pentax, which is clearly working with Casio to build these units. The screen is 2 inches, a bit small by today's standards, but very serviceable. Casio has also squeezed an optical viewfinder, but it's quite small and covers less than 90% of the sensor frame. Still, it's also serviceable and after some practice I had little trouble with it. Using the optical finder will add a great deal of battery life and can also work better than the LCD on sunny days. The camera fits in my hand better than the Optio, but it's a bit less classy looking. The door for the memory card is tiny and a bit hard to operate if you don't have a good fingernail working.Features: First of all, lets get rid of what feature that's essentially a cheat. Casio claims this camera has an anti-shake feature. But this is NOT a true VR type system. Instead the Casio brings up the ISO to 800 or 1600 while increasing shutter speed to freeze motion. It works, but at the cost of a noisy image and less detail. I suppose it's better than missing the shot, but many folks will probably skip it. The camera has a reasonable movie mode, and the usual host of features these little units share. But then 120 goes the extra mile by including a manual mode! Very nice for those folks (like me!) who also own DSLRs and like to have full control. For those who can't be bothered with such things, the 120 sports many modes, from portrait to nightshot and also a basic snapshot mode. This is a very well featured little camera.Performance: Much like the Pentax Optio, the Casio's tiny lens is both impressive and lacking all at once. There's some softness in the corners and some distortion when set to wide angle. But overall image quality is quite pleasing, AFTER you mastered the operational basics of the camera. I'm not convinced that the images are much better than other compact 5 MP models, but there is a bit more cropping latitude. These compacts are limited more by their tiny optics than the sensors. In it's automatic mode settings it does well, but the picture quality can be impressive once you take it into manual modes and experiment. Like the little Pentax, the 120 also has a great autofocus system. Set to spot it does a very good job of achieving focus lock even in dim ambient light. The flash is slightly underpowered, good for portraits and small groups. Poor AF has been a problem for many cameras, even the better prosumer models from Nikon. But the Casio truly focuses great, better than some units costing twice the price. It's contrast based, so again you need to learn how to use it. Shutter lag is almost nonexistent! Focus lock is all you'll wait for! Excellent! Unlike some of the Fuji line, the 120 does not do great at higher ISOs, but I prefer the Casio because it will focus better in low light and it has NO AF illuminator.Summary: This is a fine, practical compact camera. I bought it for my wife to use and as a second camera to compliment my D70 DSLRs (and the D200 I'm about to buy). I understand the limits of these cameras and you should as well. They are great for 5X7 prints, but you need to practice to get good 8X10s out of them. The Casio EX-Z120 hits a lot of targets, while maintaining a truly pocketable size, but I wouldn't choose it as a primary family camera because of the limits set by the size of the optics.Recommended.Capt.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "R29NBR1OG2799N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: AA batteries; Affordable; Lots of shooting modes; Decent picture quality; Creates non-proprietary jpg or avi files that everyone can viewCons: Battery monitor not helpful; Not as small as many compact cameras; image stablizer is useless due to excess noiseOverall, this is a very good camera, and I have been very happy with my purchase. Though it fits my needs very well, there are a few negative points that might bother some users. It's not as small as I would have liked (I would have preferred something akin to Canon's SD450), but that's the sacrifice made to have a good camera that uses AA batteries.In response to prior reviews about poor print quality, I have not had any problems. The first week I had the camera, I spent a lot of time playing around with the different functions and options. I then took the memory card to Walgreens and printed out some sample pics. They turned out just fine. I will say, however, that the image quality is not superior. This is not a professional photographer's camera. But, for the average point-and-shoot user, this camera will do well. At 7.2 megapixels, all of my photos have turned out at least as well as those I used to take with my film camera.As noted above, though it is nice to have a camera with a battery indicator, when using rechareable batteries, the indicator has been mostly useless. It will go from green to red and then back again many times over. Though the battery life of my 2300mAh batteries was in reality great (I didn't time them, but they lasted several weeks, helping me fill up my 512mb memory card 2-3 times), I had no real idea when it was that they were going to give out. I have to make sure to carry an extra set just in case.Also, the anti-shake DSP mode (which can be turned off) is not very helpful. The DSP causes so much noise that I never use it. But, fortunately, the DSP isn't needed to get good photos, and the other Best Shot modes are pretty helpful. There are a wide variety of modes from portrait to landscape to splashing water (and everything in between).Overall, I am very happy with this camera. It meets my needs very well. In looking for a camera, I mainly considered: size, use of AA batteries, and overall picture quality. I think I got a good combination of the three.", "Date": "February 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "The best camera I've ever used", "Author": "Jonathan Perez", "ReviewID": "R2W4Q0X4BEVFXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please note that this camera is not one for those not familiar with electronics; you must take great care of it and cannot use it to take simple snapshots as you would with a disposable camera to obtain the same results.There are modes for every occasion: nightshots provide a longer exposure, therefore allowing a better picture to be taken without flash (should you move the camera, it will create a \"ghost\" effect, therefore a tripod is best for this mode). The portrait mode allows for a \"normal\" picture. The sunset setting adds a crimson-orange glow to your image (I personally prefer the narual glow created by the sunset). The firework setting allows for the entire trail of a firework to be captured into one photo thanks to it's delayed shutter speed (again, a tripod is recommended when using this setting). I do not wish to bore you with all the settings this camera has; after all, you merely want a camera that can take quality photos of your best memories, not learn how you can become a professional photographer for National Geographics.This camera also comes with several \"focus modes\": Auto-Focus, Manual Focus, Infinity Focus, and Macro Focus. The three you should concern yourself with are the Manual, Infinity, and Macro focuses. Infinity focus is used for images that are very far away (such as a sunset). Macro focus is used for images that are very close up (such as insects). And finally, Manual focus is for-you guessed it-manually changing the focus. It isn't difficult at all to use this focus mode, simply adjust it until the image becomes crystal-clear. I do not recommend Auto-focus, it generally does not come out with as good as a quality as the other two. It is, however, efficient enough if you're in a rush and want to take some quick pictures.The camera also takes some decent video footage and can also be used as a voice recorder (however I don't really see much of a use in the latter function).Also, to clear up any misconceptions about the AntiShake DSP, this does NOT allow you to move the camera and still take a clear photo, nor does it allow you to take a clear photo of a fast-moving scenario. It does, however, eliminate most problems created by an unsteady hand and lack of a tripod (except in the case of nightshot photos). Also, please remember that this camera is not waterproof, and I would not recommend testing it's durability (i.e. don't drop it).Also, some of you may experience trouble uploading the photos through the provided USB cord. Please make sure that the cord is plugged into the camera correctly and ALL THE WAY IN. When you plug in the USB to the camera, it will respond by shutting off its screen but maintaining power. This may confuse some people into believing that it is properly inserted, however the same effect occurs if it is plugged in upside-down or halfway in (this had me a little worried for about 10 minutes, it can be a little stubborn going in the first time).", "Date": "June 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice little pocket camera.", "Author": "Dave \"davefromwash\"", "ReviewID": "R27ULHIXSY1KWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice quality made pocket camera. The pictures are just great, night pictures, landscapes, close-ups, interior shots, all have had good color & clear pictures. I did turn off the anti-shake feature as well as the digital zoom. I don't need the anti-shake (yet) and everybody should turn off the digital zoom on any camera. It was very easy to figure out, right out of the box. My previous camera was a Sony Cyber-Shot and the controls seemed almost the same. I didn't even need to read the users guide (on CD), though I probably should someday (there may be a feature I haven't found yet).  This camera is the best deal in the pocket cameras for under $350. range, though you should not expect SLR camera quality pictures from any pocket-sized point & shoot camera.  I am very happy with this little 7.2MP camera, just be sure to buy a memory card for it (I got a 1 gig card), get some quality rechargable batteries, and a nice case.

However, I WORK for Olympus in technical support. I have little experience but much know how in digital photography Had researched throughly just about every camera in this price range at 6MP or higher. Borrowing my girlfriends canon powershot A400 just wont do I needed my own camera. The shutter lag time and shot to shot time was beyond belief.  That being said I bought a casio rather than an Olympus because of the variety of manual settings and the fact it uses XD cards. A general note: Throw away the software or just keep the cd for the manual its all its good for I took one look at the photo editing software and uninstalled it.I have only had this camera a short while and I must say it will not give you images as crisp as an SLR however if you are looking for a point and shoot with the capability of manual controls that uses AAs and is capable of excellent shots look no further. Yes in low light the images will become noisey as will all digital especially ones with a small CCD sensor. I have no intention of using the video mode if ever. This camera is a battery sipper and battery life seems good to excellent overall. Has plenty of options and best shots modes to keep the point and shoot crowd happy. The camera is very fast and responsive in respect of menus and shutter delay giving seconds or fraction of a second gratification for speed freaks.I am however perplexed at another minor flaw there appears to be a stuck pixel on my LCD and I have yet to find a pixel mapping feature or something similar on any of the menus.

It is quite unfortunate that I had to return it, I feel that this camera is an excellent buy in all areas except for image quality.My previous (and still current) camera is the Canon Powershot S45 and after taking a ton of family pictures I found myself looking for another camera. Some of the features I was looking for that I didn't like about the S45 were:- A faster full or half press lag (the S45 has about a 1.2 second lag)- A camera that uses AA batteries, not proprietary- A smaller form factor- A better navigation cursor- Less red-eyeKids are the main use for this camera, tons and tons of pictures of our three children on the go everyday. We take pictures under all types of conditions and we really want a great point-and-shoot camera. The Best Shot feature of the Casio intrigued me and I figured it would help set the camera up for some of the different lighting situations we find ourselves in with our children (swimming, little gym, low light, fast action, you name it).The Casio is well built and feels solid. It is easy to hold in your hands but if you're going from a bigger camera to a smaller camera it takes a while to get used to the smaller form factor. The LCD is nice and big but a little blurry compared to the one on my S45. I didn't get a chance to see the LCD in direct light.The full and half lag time on this camera is great but I wasn't expecting the camera flash recharge rate to take as long as it did. Features were good on this camera but one that I didn't realize I wanted till I missed having it was the auto-rotation feature of the S45 when you take a picture with the camera rotated.The Best Shot feature was nice but it seamed like there should be more options available. I found myself taking most of my pictures with on the plain-jain snapshot setting.The image quality is what made me return this camera. The sharpness and color of the images was on par if not better than the S45, however the images were noisy and grainy. It took several comparison photos between the Casio and the Canon for me to finally put my finger on what I didn't like about the images. After doing some research and testing I found that the higher the ISO setting the more noisy the picture. Keeping the ISO at 50 to keep the noise down defeated the purpose of a point and shoot.I really liked this Casio and I wish the image quality was good enough for me to want to keep it. With kids on the move it's unrealistic to use the red-eye reduction features of digital cameras and I use iPhoto to remove red-eye. The images were noisy enough where the red-eye removal tool in iPhoto didn't clean up all the red-eye.If you are the type of person that looks at HDTV and says \"what's the big deal\" or are upgrading from a 1MP camera this might be a good option for you but if you're used to very good image quality you might want to reconsider.As an aside, I wish the full manual came in paper form and not PDF on a disc.", "Date": "February 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "K.

At first it took crisp, beautiful pictures, then several months ago, they started looking slightly out of focus, and many looked grainy and dark when i loaded them on the computer.  This was really upsetting, and I thought it was broken.  Called the support number in the paperwork, and very quickly got to a \"live human\" who instructed me on how to reset the camera back to factory specs.  Voila!  Took some test pictures, including one of my cat, and they were perfect!  Even blew up the cat picture up close to cover my entire monitor screen and every little hair detail is perfect. The color is vibrant and true to life.  For those who have complained that their pics are grainy and dark, try going to menu, then set-up, and scroll to reset and select it.  It just may help.This camera is so easy to use, that even without a manual, a child could figure it out.  It uses standard AA batteries, including rechargeables, and a standard SD card, so its easy on the wallet to maintain.  The picture quality is beautiful (again).  Its a little thicker than the card-style Casio cameras, but definitely small and light enough to fit in a compartment in my purse, so its always with me. I also have to compliment Casio on their customer service.  The first time I called them was to order another USB cable for my camera.  Got to a live person quickly, and they sent me out another quickly and inexpensively.  This last time about the picture quality, again, got to a live person quicky, and he really did help.

I've dragged my camera around the world with me, my husband took his on deployment to Iraq with him, and I used our current Exilim every day to take pictures for my Ebay auctions. Macro mode on this camera is amazing! You can see every detail on everything. People always comment on how my travel pictures look like postcards. They're so crisp, so vivid and they're all taken with the Exilim! I can't sing enough praises about this camera! I am a bit of an enthusiast when it comes to photography, but I'm no professional, I just have a good eye and I read the manual and adjust settings occaisonally to optimize my results. I don't see why anybody should have a problem getting pictures just as crisp and vivid and amazing as mine. I've never had an issue with any Exilim I've previously owned either. The first one was GREAT and we sold it to upgrade. Then my husband bought one when he deployed, so we had two in the family. When he got back, the 7mp just came out (late last year), and since he's the quintessential male gadget whore, he insisted we get rid of both our 5mp Exilims and get the 7mp model.I wholeheartedly recommend the Exilim, for me, personally, I am not even considering another model. I'm just deciding right now if I want a smaller, pretty coloured one, or the 7mp again? Do i need a view finder? I can definitely think of times I should have used it, but I forgot that it was there! Hhhmmm... decisions, decisions! I hope my honest and enthusiastic endorsement of the Exilim has helped you choose this perfectly fabulous little camera.

I purchased this camera for my trip to Disney World with a pre-schooler.  I needed point and shoot technology that would not require a lot of fuss to operate.  I loved the ability to keep this camera in my pocket for those \"magical moments\". It was easy to change camera settings for action shots, portraits, fireworks and candle light.  I even liked the ability to shoot in black and white and antique modes.  I left my video camera at home as well and used the camera's video instead.  The antishake technology works pretty well but don't expect it to fix the shake of shooting on a roller coaster.  I am pleased that my shots were a lot more spontaneous and I did not have to lug tons of equipment around the parks.  In short, with a 1Gig card and a laptop to down load pictures every evening - I can't image traveling on vacation with my old cameras again.

But that said, in my experience the camera leaves something to be desired. My previous camera was an HP 945, which was big, bulky, and very slow, but it took truly excellent pictures (beautiful color and very sharp) and had a very long optical zoom. Unfortunately, the HP broke and so I found this one as a replacement. I've had it for about 6 months and while it is okay and can take good pictures, a lot of times I'll review photos after taking around 100 or so and I'll be disappointed with many of them. Either they are fuzzy and out of focus (I mostly use full auto mode), have noise in them (based on other reviews I've read this camera is known to have more noise at lower ISO than other cameras), or just somehow be not quite right. The video functionality is nice and takes 28 fps at VGA quality, but it stores the videos in MJPEG format which really eats up storage space; also the videos often suffer from jaggies (i.e. appear pixelated) --- other Casio cameras are known to suffer this problem too (e.g. ex-z850). The camera is very quick though, and compact, and I like that it uses AA batteries.

As it is not tight enough, sometimes it gets accidentally switched (e.g. from some photo to video mode) while you carry the camera in a pocket or a bag and you may start taking pictures thinking that you are using a photo mode but you shoot some video instead.

When I tried the camera out, I loved the look and feel of the controls as well as the menu system and the price was right, so it looked like I couldn't go wrong. Not quite.When I received my own camera in the mail from 17th street photo (An excellent vendor, btw. Highly recommended.), I noticed that the speed of the camera was very slow, especially as compared to my WD7. You'd snap the picture, the flash would go off and you'd wait at least 5 seconds for the viewscreen to come back up. This was alieviated a bit by autofocusing first or not using the flash at all, but when I brought the camera to a party, I lost the opportunity for several good pictures as a result of this problem. I also lost several good pictures due to the slowness of the flash recharge time. There's also major redeye, which I realize is common, though the flash is so slow, it confused the people I took pictures of, who moved before the second burst went off.Then of course there is the oft-mentioned battery indicator, which is useless. The USB cover feels like it could fall off at any moment and the port itself is so tight that you have to push and pull really, really hard to plug it in and pull it out. Also, the mode wheel on the side is in a bad spot and easy to mistakenly turn when holding the camera. Lastly, the 8.3 MB of internal memory is a joke. They might as well not include any at all and just shave a few bucks off the camera's price.So aside from the software, I would not recommend this camera at all.
