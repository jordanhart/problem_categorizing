Installing is basically plugging in your cameras at the back then powering up the unit. Plug in a monitor and you are all set. Networking it is also fairly easy if you are familiar with setting up a network hub or a router. The only thing i did not try is accessing the dvr through the internet. The software that came with the dvr is also very good and support for it is also available. I highly recommend this to everyone seeking for a self installation of security dvr. Compared to how much security companies will install and service a new dvr, if you have the camera's installed already, then this is your best solution.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,500.00", "Features": "32ch Full D1 Real-Time Standalone DVR, HDMI 1080P, Mobile phone remote", "Name": "NEW 32CH HD Standlone 960FPS Real-Time DVR HDMI, 2TB, DVD-RW", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V2VXb6rqL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003O4UIIS"}}
