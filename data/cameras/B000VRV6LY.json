MACLEAN", "ReviewID": "R1VQKOVHNTO5UI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The three major factors that, for me, make this camera (2 of them apply to the D300) so incredible are . . . well, the full frame sensor (finally), the outstanding low-noise/high ISO performance . . . and the extraordinary color! The photographer has a greater deal of control over color than ever before and the results are stunning (use Picture Control). And noise (the digital equivalent of film grain) is at least a 2-stop improvement over the previous D2x. Actually, it's probably 3 stops, but say 2 to be conservative. Believe it or not, ISO 6400 is actually usable! (The D300 is one stop less)While those features were the most compelling ones in my view, there are plenty of others that are a big plus, such as:~ 9 frames per second~ 51 point AF~ Live View~ 12mp CMOS sensor, self-cleaning on D300~ A new 3\" LCD--about 4x the resolution as previous LCDs.The list goes on, but you should read the tech specs and professional reviews. Suffice it to say it is loaded with features and handles like an absolute dream!Compared to Canon's $8000 professional models, this camera has a very clear advantage. Sure you lose some megapixels compared to the MarkIII, but that's not so important for the majority of (but not all) photographers.Another thought . . . while this is a good deal at $4999 compared to Canon, you can get almost the same camera for $1799, with the D300. If you don't need a full frame . . . or the extra 1-stop high ISO, the D300 offers about 90 - 95% of the features and performance of the D3 for 40% of the price! If you want to get the best possible picture quality for the lowest possible price, consider the D300 and put the difference ($3200) on some of Nikon's great new professional lenses.As of this January 2008 writing, this is listed on Amazon at $6399 through Cameta Camera. PLEASE DON'T buy at this price and allow yourself to be exploited by the backorder situation. Instead, pre-paying $4999 for it at your local camera store puts you ahead of everyone else on the waitlist who merely put down deposits on it. Or wait until it comes down here on Amazon. Again, $4999! That's the price. There is no need to pay an extra $1400 \"sucker fee\" for it just to have it a few weeks or maybe a month or two earlier. You survived until now without the D3, so you can make it a little longer--just don't pay more than retail. $4999! $4999. $4999. Get the point? :-)Post Script, April 16, 2008:I notice this is now being sold by 17th Street Photo, who I've not done business with, but at least they are charging the *correct* price of $4999. First it was a $1400 markup, then $500, and it's good to see the price gouging attempts appear to be dying down.Post Script #2, November 2, 2008:How times change--the gouging is gone, and so are the backorders. The price has dropped below $4500 I see. My opinion on this camera remains unchanged in the 11 months since I first got my hands on it, and it's as excellent as it ever was, but now, with the introduction of the D700, I would have a hard time spending the approximately $4300 it now sells for, when the D700 is selling for $2699. The D3 is better built, and shoots 9 fps vs the D700's 8 fps with battery pack, but I don't see it being worth the added $1600 cost unless you're a professional who shoots every day.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Best SLR I have owned", "Author": "Serge Marinkovic MD", "ReviewID": "RVD0E6I67JRR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently sold my Canon 1DS Mark2 and the accompaning 14 mm wide angle lenses because after trying out a Nikon D3 I found the Nikons pictures so much better.  True, the Canon software is easier but to me the ergonomics of the D3 are better than the Canon 1DS Mark2 while the detail, clarity and accuracy are still better.  Even 24\" poster comparisons between both camera's have the Nikon winning in every detail.  I am now a proud Nikon owner I think although Canon has more pixels 16.3 versus 12.1 the pictures at large a simply not as good.  I perform operative photography and am in the process of finishing a book on Female Reconstructive surgery this is were the comparisons became for my field so much more apparent.  The colors for the Nikon are just so much more dynamic and precise while the Canon is not as vibrant and demonstrative of detail.  I found for comparisons sake that the Canon videocamcorder XL H1 colors versus the Sony comparable model to again lack color precision, depth of field and to simply to the less experienced eye to lack quality needed for surgeons.  So I am now going to start to build a Nikkor lens assortment.  By the way I took 20000 with my Canon so I know its downside well under all conditions.

This camera handles like it was designed by a photographer, not a tech. It's easy to do everything you want, and the quality is simply outstanding. If you're debating it - don't. Just get one and you'll understand!It has a TON of incredible features, but here are some of my favs:I know everyone praises the low light abilities and they are outstanding. I am able to get landscapes that would have been impossible before. I normally had to shoot ISO 100, so a tripod was mandatory. Now I routinely use 400 and even 800! I can get into tight spots and hand-hold now! This feature alone has completely changed the way I do photography!Another feature that I really like was the smaller AF areas. If you're doing wildlife, it makes it much easier to lock on to your subject when the animal is in heavy brush (you know, like all the time).  The Canons would always have a hard time in these situations, the Nikon grabs the focus immediately.One last feature I'm really excited about is the virtual horizon. It makes keeping the camera level just so much easier. It has two ways of showing it - the first is a big display on the back that looks like it's out of a 747 and is kind of useless. The second is to set your function button on the front of the camera for virtual horizon. Just press that in with your pinky while you look through the finder and the exposure meter turns into your virtual horizon. Just get it to \"0\" and you're level. Much easier to do than it sounds. I always thought My shots were level, but I was really surprised how often I needed a little tilt one way or the other.The camera has incredible autofocus, a viewfinder so good you can actually manually focus with it if you like, an incredible screen on the back you can use to check focus accurately (impossible with any current Canon, at least by comparison), and so much more.

There is not a DSLR in the world that should cost $10,000, not even the amazing Pentax 645 40mp medium-format DSLR.  Realistically, you should not pay more than $6,500 for this camera.

I prefer the heavy feel, I disliked the light plastic, cheap feel of so many of the cheaper SLR's. I owned the Minolta 7D before which is a very good camera, but can't compare to the D3. I was told the D3 was such a complex camera from a friend that read a review, that you couldn't just take it out of the box and take pictures. I disagree. If you can charge a battery, and read the quick start section, this camera can take good pictures almost by itself. Your only task is to read the quick start, which makes sure some of the buttons, default, have not been moved. You point and push a button, if all the buttons, and little switches have not been moved you take a good shot. I know my experience with the Minolta helped but I was taking pictures within 10 to 15 minutes. A complete novice would have to take more time. I understood many of the control dials and settings and loved the positioning and feel of the controls. To take what I hope is great shots, will take more time and effort, this camera can do so many things. I couldn't believe that when using an ISO setting of 3200 you could see the object and as clear as you can see it. The shutter lag to me compared to my film camera is none existent, could'nt tell the difference. Couple this camera with the famous renouned Nikon lenses and you have in my opinion an unbeatable combination. I know Nikon will probably come out in a few years with a camera of same caliper with more pixel count. My only wish is that the D3 had a few more pixel count but I don't know why. I think I have been brian washed with pixels, because when I print the pictures on my wide EpsonEpson Stylus Pro 4800 Color Inkjet Printer the results are amazing. I would highly recommend this camera to those that are Pro's or like me a serious want to be Pro who has been taking pictures for almost 50 of my 58 years.", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not about the camera - It's the glass that counts", "Author": "T.

Over the years we have accumulated a good collection of glass and while we recognized we would have to migrate from film eventually, we hesitated (actually resisted) because of the value of our glass. You who understand such things can emphathize.When the FX D3 was announced we rented one for a week and shot about 1800 shots using our legacy AI and AI-S lenses (16mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 105mm, 135mm, 180mm, 200mm and 300mm, and 80-200 Zoom, all with f1.2 to f2.8 maximum openings) to verify the compatibility.Using Aperture metering for most of our shots as we have done with our FE, FA, F4, and F5, manual metering as we did with our F, FM, and F3 to really test the camera's ability to give us what we are used to seeing with Kodachrome film (asa 25, 64, 100, 200) we came away from the week completely satisfied. We shot in low light, night light, bright light, into the sun, into the moon, in fog, in rain, indoors, in offices, in museums, and at Camden Yards watching our beloved Oryuls get beat again (sigh). We both feel the camera and lenses ought to be completely transparent to what we are trying to do. If you know how to take photographs, the camera really doesn't matter as long as it can physically interpret what your eye is seeing. Our film Nikons with Kodachrome did that. Our fear was that there would not be a digital camera that could perform to the Kodachrome standard.We have found our mother lode. We have purchased the D3 and a backup D700 for our final cameras. We will gladly go into our retirement knowing we can still do the shooting that gives us pleasure and not be hamstrung with $30 per roll costs for film.We would not have considered digital until the FX cameras emerged. Now we know our most cherished pastime will continue to entertain us and Nikon wins again.A word of caution: This camera is not for the faint of heart. It is not a novice photographer's camera. It requires a reasonably steep learning curve.

I had semi-switched to Canon with the purchase of the EOS 1D Mark III. Despite reports over focusing issues, I haven't had any real problems with it. The frame rate and high ISO on it is phenomenal. Anyhow, the D3's 9-fps at full frame, impressive high ISO, and a wealth of other features on it were enough to lure me and my wallet back to the Nikon camp. After some comparison test shots at different high ISO settings on the D3, D2Xs, and Mark III, I have to say that the D3's noise level is as good, maybe even a tad bit better than the Mark III. The D2Xs was a very distant third, clearly unacceptable at ISO 1600. Also, the D3's auto white balance appears to be more accurate than the Mark III. I haven't had extensive use of the D3 yet, but so far, it performs as good as Canon's best offering in terms of speed and noise level.8/27/08 - After having used it for 7+ months, the D3 is better than the Mark III in just about every aspect - focusing, color, white-balance, low noise, ergonomics. But the only thing I haven't gotten down is flash exposure with the SB-800.

This is a very rugged, quite dependable, camera that is capable of 9 frame-per-second bursts and an ISO range up to 25,000, coupled to an extremely sophisticated 51-zone AF system (There is also an impressive-looking 3-inch LCD monitor located on the camera back, that's capable of almost instantaneous live-view.). In short, this is the dream camera for any professional or serious amateur photographer who was seeking a rugged, full-frame sensor digital SLR camera from Nikon.I was extremely delighted with how well it handled, when I tried it over at the 2007 Photo Plus East Nikon booth back in late October. Much to my amazement, this camera was unusually quieter than what I've expected from most digital SLR cameras. It truly felt that this is a camera that could run virtually by itself in some kind of autopilot mode. However, I was especially impressed with how easily I could use it without resorting to a camera manual, as though the camera itself was an intuitive accessory permanently attached to my body. If I had any doubts about this camera's capabilities, they were soon dispelled after I saw photographer Joe McNally's slideshow presentation demonstrating how hard he put this camera through its paces during a nocturnal photo shoot in Times Square.  My only regret is that I couldn't march off to the Zeiss USA booth and request an instant loan of several Zeiss ZF lenses to try with this camera; however, I am quite optimistic that this combination would have yielded some spectacular images. I am also willing to wager that this brand new Nikon digital SLR camera will soon acquire a legion of fans, who will be quite interested in its extensive abilities, starting, of course, with its full-frame digital sensor.", "Date": "December 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "For $5000 you get...", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R31SQ7CNHT4RPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ability to take pictures in extreme conditions that actually look good.

The D3 basically allowed me to take pictures without flash for an extra 20 minutes.  So it can literally take pictures that your old camera could not.  Other than that, the construction and speed is robust and Nikon shooters already know about the excellent ergonomics and button layout.One note though:  There are a few dead pixels in live view mode.  I exchanged it for another brand new one which ALSO had dead pixels (although fewer).  Since I never use live view, I let it go but just a warning.

For anyone who would like a quick and easy way to include a note to go along with a photo that's just been shot (for example, the name and title of the person being photographed), or perhaps record some audio to go along with the subject of the photos (like the music from a carousel being shot), this neat feature can't be beat. I first had it on my D100, thanks to the optional base that also doubles the battery capacity. The optional base for the D200 and D300 do not have that audio recording capability, so that omission was a significant factor in my decision to buy a D2X instead when I was ready for a better camera than my D100. As they say, \"try it, you'll like it.\" I still use my D100 and D2X when I don't want to change lenses in the field, but the D3 is way better. The low light capability is incredible and the \"Live View\" feature is great when I need to hold my camera over people's heads and still be able to see what I'm about to shoot. I can't wait to see what Nikon brings out to replace the D3! One thing I would like Nikon to do is bring out an equivalent to Tamron's very useful 28-300mm, non-DX compact zoom lens (so yes, it works well with the D3). When I have to travel light, that lens just can't be beat. I've been happily using it since I bought it back when I only had my D100 and needed to stick to a tight budget. The story I keep getting from Nikon vendors and reps alike is that if Nikon made it, it would be way too expensive. Really? Since when did price stop people from buying Nikon lenses? Maybe if enough people ask for it Nikon will eventually make it...Aug. 31, 2013 update:I now shoot primarily with a Nikon D3S. It has the same audio record feature at the press of a button on the back of the camera. I still use that feature a lot to identify something that I want to remember about the shot that it is tied to.As for the 28-300mm lens, Nikon started making one.

I have used Nikons since 1971 so I have drunk gallons of their Kool-Aid. My last film Nikon was the wonderful F5 - a camera that was everything a 35MM camera could be. But that camera was less than $2000 (still a stretch for most of us) so it was significantly less expensive than the D3 when it came to the market. I had to pass on buying one for financial reasons and started down the digital road with a Nikon D70S and moved up to a D200. These cameras produce marketable images (I shoot for magazines) and have been reliable tools for over 5 years. However, I always kept my eye out for a deal on a lightly used D3 (in my work, I have no need to get the video model). That never happened until the D4 and then the D800 came to the market. I finally found one at a local camera shop with fewer than 6K \"clicks\" and the price was less than half of the original selling price. I was torn between buying the used D3 and a new D800 (or a new Canon 5D Mk III - I have lots of Canon gear too). However, once I had the camera in my hand and reconnected to that great F5 feel, I bit the bullet and bought the used D3.To say that I'm happy would be an understatement. First, the full sized sensor makes my wide angle lenses wide again. That's very helpful in my world. Next, the amazingly fast \"motor drive\" is great for motorsports. I used it for a vintage race over Labor Day Weekend and a couple thousand images later, I was quite impressed with the image quality, fast auto-focus and excellent exposure and color accuracy.While I wish I had a new D4 and a few years from now will probably buy one (assuming they too drop in price like the D3) this is still one heck of a working professional's tool. The high-eye-point view finder makes seeing the entire screen easy. While the auto-focus system is an older design, it still works very well. The auto exposure system seems (to my eyes) dead on. The F5 and the F4 cameras I used back in the film days were blessed with this kind of accurate exposure metering system so the D3's feels and works like and old friend. The real benefit of this camera is its high ISO capabilities. I have shot at 800, 1600 and 3200 ISO and found the results quite good. With my other cameras, anything above 800 turns to a digital noise fest.So while I still use the D200 (and like it) and have Canon gear that I like and use for motorsports, I find that I am reaching for the D3 more and more because I think it makes me a better photographer.Can you ask more from a camera than that?", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a Nikon...need I say more???", "Author": "J.

White balance control, especially the preset function, is a godsend.All the controls are well placed and within easy reach, even for a person like me with medium-sized hands.

I'm sure the D4 will be outstanding but would have been nice to have the same chargers and batteries. I also use a D200 and it's a nice camera, but the D3 is stellar. The large viewfinder and 5:4 professional crop is especially nice. The ISO flexibility makes hand held possible where in the past tripods were a must. Now they are needed much less frequently. Couldn't be more happy with this camera especially at 2012 prices.  With low power flash settings and the camera adjusted right you can shoot 11fps with flash. I do this mostly manual but is very impressive speed. More for fun than practical reasons.If you don't need the speed or build quality and can afford a bit more then the D800 should be outstanding, huge file sizes at full resolution so have large fast cf and sd cards.

The main thing to keep in your arsenal is a can of compressed air; the full frame sensor loves to catch dust, especially when you have to change lenses all the time. I now use my other pro camera - the Nikon D2HS - as a lens holder. The image quality isn't even in the  ballpark with the D3, so I want the best images possible, especially in low light conditions. Otherwise I need to keep changing lenses which can expose the camera's innards to dust or micro metal (a natural occurrence whenever anyone changes lenses on any camera with the metal mounts). But I heard that Nikon didn't have a vibration mechanism to clear off particles for build reasons.The other pain is that the D3 has the full frame sensor. We have a mix now, of DX lenses (for those cameras with the smaller sensors) and FX lenses (and older film lenses, some of which I never let go of). You can't use, say the 9mm DX fisheye lens without seeing major vignetting, making you have to set the camera to the DX setting (which does yield a lower image size).I used to rarely shoot at sensitivity ratings of anything higher than 800 ISO unless I couldn't manage an image otherwise. While I still bristle for a moment when I set the D3 at ISO 3200 (I still like going a smudge less, to ISO 2500) I now shrug and know that the image I get will do just fine. I've simply grown up with digital cameras since those days in the 1990's with the Nikon N90 was morphed into the Kodak NC2000. Imagine the images they made when your card size was 128MB! Blech.But I also had the Nikon F5 film camera in my hands back in the day, having to give it up for the Nikon D1 body, the first production pro Nikon digital camera. So much has changed since then, including my experience and feelings about that age-old preference between film and digital cameras. I understood then that digital photography was a necessary evil in order to get something posted or printed quickly, as opposed to taking film to the one-hour lab. So I will make a \"film vs digital\" stand at this point, with this camera, with no regrets: With the Nikon D3, I will say that I prefer the D3 to the film F5 camera, hands down.  I also prefer the D3 to film, so digital to me is no longer evil. Ask me to elaborate and I will, but not in this review.This is a professional camera at a professional price. Heck, I sure didn't buy it for myself, and our staff only gets one D3 per staffer. So even large businesses may bristle at the price. This camera spoils me. I want images that are this nice all the time. You can't shoot more than 38 pictures in a film camera. And even with film rated at ISO 1600, I truly believe that the D3 can match or beat film quality (noise vs grain structure). While I haven't found anyone who has, I think it's high time we start comparing film to digital images.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "The camera we knew Nikon could build", "Author": "San Diego Photo Enthusiast \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R3LQFWRNPOJULL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)This is the Nikon I had been waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for -- a full-frame DSLR.  Sure, Canon has had full-frame DSLRs for many years, but I have a significant investment in Nikon lenses for my Nikon bodies (including the F4s, F6, D100, and D200, among others).Now, it is true that I began my SLR days in the Canon line; but when the 35mm SLR world began to go autofocus and Canon chose to create a platform that would not use the existing manual-focus Canon lenses, I realized that I was going to have to buy new lenses either way.  As it turned out, I elected to move over to Nikon (keeping just one or two of my manual-focus Canons).What took Nikon so long to come out with its \"FX\" (full-frame) cameras?  I don't know, but from what I have read, there has been a shake-up at Nikon, reflecting a certain amount of angst at having waited so long and giving away sales to Canon.  I recall reading one website in which the author suggested that Nikon was \"doing the right thing\" by not making full-frame cameras, since it isn't really possible to do so, anyway.  Huh?  No kidding -- the author worked very hard to create a case that the physics of light do not permit camera manufacturers to create a camera with a full-frame (24x36mm) sensor, and that Nikon had somehow taken the moral high ground by refusing to bow to full-frame hysteria......one of the (unintentionally) funniest things I've ever read.  Since Canon already had been making full-frame cameras for some time -- and I guess we all just knew it was a matter of time before Nikon got its head on straight -- I couldn't help but think of the old quote that goes something like this:  \"Never tell the man who is busy doing something that it is impossible.\"Now, I've never held the high-end Canon (the EOS 1Ds Mark III), which goes for over $7,000, but I HAVE held the 5D and I like it very much.  Like many others, I might have retraced my steps back to Canonland if Nikon had tarried much longer.  But as much as I liked the 5D (which I obviously could have purchased using the D3 funds -- with a lens or two or three -- and still had change left over), the D3 is a much better camera.  Both the Product Details on this site and the reviews by the other D3 owners will provide you with many of the technical reasons for this.I guess I don't want to repeat those technical reasons here.  Most any decent DSLR can produce good and useable images.  What it comes down to is how the camera FEELS in your hands as you use it....and the D3 just feels good. It doesn't look or feel like cheap extruded plastic (which, I am afraid, is a problem with the Canons).  The D3 feels solid, substantial, and has clearly benefited from the attention of the folks in the ergonomics labs.  It's anything but a lightweight, but I've been carrying large Nikons around for many years, so that is not a disincentive for me.At this point I've only owned the camera for a short time and have only had the opportunity to take a relatively small number of exposures -- perhaps the equivalent of two or three rolls of film (sorry, old habits die hard).  I still have many things to learn about it in order to more fully exploit its capabilities....but I am very impressed with what I've seen so far.  I have one CF Card set to record NEF (raw), the other to record high-res JPG.  One thing I miss is the built-in architectural viewfinder gridlines that were standard with several of my previous Nikons.  Yes, I know that one can buy a \"Type E\" replacement focusing screen or set the \"FUNC.\" button for a (funky) capability that Nikon refers to as the \"Virtual Horizon,\" but why did Nikon choose not to include the gridlines as a standard feature/capability?  Also, Nikon really should package the camera with a decent eyecup.All-in-all, a wonderful camera.
