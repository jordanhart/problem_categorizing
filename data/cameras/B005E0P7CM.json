I finally made my mind to order by merely looking at Seller's profile and product details. And thankfully I can say I got a great deal. All the products are delivered on time as promised.This camera is awesome and very good for the people who are looking to shift to DSLR from point-n-shoot. As far as whole bundle is concerned it has good combination of products such as branded memory card, cleaning kit, remote, battery, UV protection and camera carrying bag. The stand is also of good quality. In short I am happy with bundle that I have opted for....", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera and lens!", "Author": "bdingman", "ReviewID": "R3L7SGBE7ESZM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been hoping to upgrade from my Canon XT (350D) for some time and have gone back and and forth on all of the options. I finally read a review on the T3i which basically said that you'd be nuts not to get this camera - after all, people were paying thousands of dollars for the 1D Mark ii when it came out and this is far more capable. I remember dreaming about that camera and wishing I could afford one ... and now, here is the T3i and it's far more affordable and incredibly capable. It persuaded me that this would be enough camera for now! I don't have to spend thousands of dollars to get the top of the line camera because this one more than performs!I took it out on a test run last week and I used the 18-55 IS II lens that's included in this package. The lens performs amazingly well also. I wish it had a little more range (I'm used to an 18-70, but I have really worn that lens out, which is why I wanted a package that included a new lens and this lens has been rated really well!) I'm really happy with the photos I've taken with this combination and will definitely keep using this lens.I highly recommend this combination, especially if you need a full kit to start shooting!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera - Canon T3i", "Author": "Swaraj-Sadhana-Sharad", "ReviewID": "R1ZSEMWR33PU1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently thought to switch from regular digital camera,Sony Cyber-shot to a DSLR camera!!! So we were researching a bit on which one we should go for. Amazon is indeed an amazing website that we found it so helpful to compare different products and select the right one based on our requirements. We finally decided to go for Canon T3i bundle that comes with 75-300mm lens and other accessories. It was a big investment in camera for us. We specially want to thank the seller for being so honest to send all the items of great quality and also for keeping the promise. We got exactly what was posted online. Everything was in great condition when we received these items.The camera is amazingly good and takes very cool pictures. We were stunned when we saw images form this camera. Now every weekend we have different theme for photography! I strongly recommend this seller and the camera as well.Photography is a great fun...We love it...", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice camera", "Author": "shawn", "ReviewID": "R1O9JVR2VV4L7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just received this today so all the photo's i took were on automatic settings, but the auto mode on this camera does a very fine job and i was very happy with the photos!  of course i upgraded from a fuji s4000 with a fixed lens so the quality difference is huge!  with the 300mm at full zoom i took a photo of some turkeys a few hundred yards away and after cropping the photo on my computer i can the turkey pretty well!  the quality was not as good as the other photos,  but still acceptable for me!  i have not tried the lens doubler yet because of things i read online saying the wrong one can damage your camera when used on the canon rebel?  the lens did come with the kit so it should be compatible,  but i don't know if i want to risk it?  Cameta store was great items were packaged well and i really enjoy shopping with Amazon,  but the USPS is another matter!  i upgraded to priority shipping and the item was shipped the next day and still took a full week to travel the 200 miles to my house?  over all very happy with this camera!  was consider the nikon D5100 also when i purchased this, but i have no regrets!", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything Good except- .45x Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto Lenses", "Author": "Kadathurkaran", "ReviewID": "R2IUEBMAJE7NFK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": ".45x Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto Lenses which is not suited with Camera, Simply that is waste, i hope i cant use it any more.
