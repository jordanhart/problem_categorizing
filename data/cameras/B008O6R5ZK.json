{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than OEM", "Author": "John G. Frykman \"jfrykman\"", "ReviewID": "R1LWV0QAONTLYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am impressed with the product and the value.  The \"off-brand\" Bower batteries are actually rated at 1800 mAh in comparison to the 1240 mAh rating of the Sony branded battery. That is nearly 50% higher capacity.  Does the charge last longer?  My experience is that the charge lasts significantly longer.  The charger itself is certainly not \"of lower quality\" as another post here suggests.  I'm not sure what charger it is being compared to as so far, no one has seen a Sony charger for this battery.  It charges from \"empty\" to full charge in about 1-1/2 hours. It also comes with an adapter for your car's power outlets and a European-style receptacle adapter.  I have not tried either, but will see how well the charger works in a car.  Being able to charge a spare battery in a car is a huge plus for people on the move.  This same charger can be purchased for as little as $4.75 elsewhere by itself, and the batteries at $8.80.  That compares favorably with the price of the kit here.  The Sony brand batteries are list priced at $49.95 although you can get them for as little as around $32 on line.  But that is still nearly four times as much for a battery that has less capacity.  Yes, they are Chinese manufactured just as the DSC-RX100 is, and just as the OEM battery is.If is certainly possible that the OEM battery has a longer useful life, but the Bower battery has a 5-year guaranty.  If the battery lasts 1/5 that long in daily use I will be happy--after all, they are a consumable.  The camera itself has a 1-year guaranty and it is not \"consumable.\"In summary, no one should avoid these products because they do not carry the Sony brand.  They are well built and represent a solid value.  I will not be buying a Sony battery at four times the price when I can obtain a product that is certainly worth more than 1/4 the price of OEM batteries.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed", "Author": "Mikey_B", "ReviewID": "R30AU7XK4H2TMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this kit the day after I received my RX100. Went on a 7-day cruise four days later. Charged the Sony battery and the two Bowers. Used the Bower charger on the Sony battery and it worked just fine. Day 1 of the trip loaded a Bower battery in the RX100 and never looked back. Took 700 pictures in a week and did a partial internal charge on the same Bower battery in the camera one time. Carried the Sony battery and the other Bower in my camera case and never used them. I did a lot of viewing and deleting as I went. I took nine short videos (average of 2 minutes) and the rest were the 700 shots at 20MP using the two-minute shutdown feature on the camera to conserve battery life. The battery indicator on the camera stayed full a long time before it showed usage. A minor issue since I had two others ready to go. The Bowers are rated at 1800 mAh. Sony at 1240 mAh. Some say the higher rating is exaggerated but I would be hard to convince at this point. Very good bargain since the Sony battery is a little less than twice the price for the kit. I sold digital cameras for almost eight years, owned 5 high-end Sonys from the F505 to the R1, which I still travel with. The RX100 is phenomenal and it is my first Sony camera in which I have used third-party batteries. I am a Sony purist no longer. Excellent bargain. Would certainly buy again.

In other words it seems like it's all or nothing so if the indicator shows any wear don't trust that there's a lot of power left and get it to the charger. The fact that you get two battery's and a charger that can be used in the house or car still, in my opinion, makes it a good buy.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "It does the job well", "Author": "BP", "ReviewID": "R3WFVR4FG1SH3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I resolved not to be caught again with a dead camera and no spare battery.  So when I got the RX100 I looked for reasonably priced backup batteries and a convenient recharger.  This recharger and batteries seem to satisfy those requirements.  The charger is small enough to easily carry on trips and the inclusion of a European plug adapter (as well as the US plug) and AC adapter increase it's utility.  And the batteries do what batteries are supposed to do.  They charge and power the camera.One word about the 4 star rating.  To date I've been satisfied with the recharger and batteries, but I've only had then for a few days.

The sony original battery has capacity of 1240mAh. You do the math. :)I give only three stars because the capacity is not 1600mAh.

Like most if not all cameras in this category, the camera uses a tiny tiny battery which barely holds any power.  Definitely no good for all day shooting on vacation.  In addition, the camera doesn't ship with a charger, compounding the small battery.  Even if I bought another battery, I would have to charge one battery, swap it out, and charge thee other.  There's no way to use the camera and charge a back up battery at the same time.This charger and battery combo fixes that.  The supplied charger charges batteries relatively quickly, and the two extra batteries ensure plenty of power.The kit comes with- Charger (a generic one which is capable of charing multiple batteries with different holders)- NP-BX1 adapter plate for the charger- 2 generic batteries- European plug adapter- 12V car adapter for charging on the goThe kit also comes with some other goodies:- A little microfiber cloth branded with the seller's logo- A pack of 3 screen protectors, good for 5\" screensFor the price, these are excellent.  However, the kit does have some problems:The batteries claim they are 2100mAh, while the genuine Sony ones are rated at 1240mAh.  This rating seems a little generous, if not outright deceptive.  The generic batteries here weigh 21.7g, while the genuine Sony weighs 24.5g.The charger also overcharges the batteries.  Lithium ion batteries are much less robust than other batteries types and are very sensitive to overcharging.  The charge level of these batteries can be measured directly by the voltage of the battery, which shouldn't exceed 4.2 volts.  In camera, the RX100 charged the Sony battery to 4.182V.  This charger took the generic batteries slightly over at 4.247 and 4.254 volts, which is a little high for my liking, thus the 1 star deduction.Overall, I find this product to be a great value and well worth it.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Too good to be true???", "Author": "Sue Ellen Harrison", "ReviewID": "R30YFTU023ZXAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The batteries were fine, but the charger only worked one time.
