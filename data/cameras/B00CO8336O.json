However, this camera is simply great.  All of these people on here dogging it because of the lens mount or the viewfinder are really just grabbing at straws in my opinion.  This is not marketed as a professional grade camera and unless you are a professional photographer, who is switching lenses dozens of times daily?  I have done several lens swaps and had no problems and after looking at the overall build quality on this camera, I am not worried about the mount wearing out.  I used to have a Nikon D3100 which was great for my needs but I dropped it and ruined the lens and the body so I needed a new one.  I was going to just get another 3100 but decided I'd look around first.  Personally, I love the electronic viewfinder compared to the traditional type found on the rest of the DSLRs on the market.  It makes it easy for an amateur to see exactly what the shot will look like before you take it.  The video quality is second to none.  It is better than the Rebel T5i (my sister owns) and the D5200 (my neighbor owns).  I am going to get an external mic before long to completely get rid of the noise of the auto focus but it is nowhere near as loud or annoying as some would have you believe.  Coming from a Nikon, the controls are slightly different. I wouldn't say better or worse, just different.  I mention this because some people say the controls are not user friendly but I say BS to that as well.  If you learned on something else, you are used to that format and anything different will take some getting used to.  For me, the image quality is better than anything in its class (sub $800).  Even the high ISO pics I have tried gave me less noise than I was ever able to achieve on my old Nikon.  All in all, if you are in the market for and entry level camera and aren't afraid to stand up to all the Nikon and Canon fan boys out there, this camera will surpass your expectations.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected.", "Author": "Grobo", "ReviewID": "RZ35YBK2VM824", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a feature rich camera.  I have been using SLR film cameras for 20 years and have been reluctant to go digital SLR.  I was concerned that the technology was still not quite capable of reproducing film quality pictures.  But a about 3 years ago I bought a fujifilm f100 and was surprised by the quality of even that small camera.  I finally made the leap this year after I found only one place in town that would process film.  Obviously, that is a dying process.  So when I looked at the reviews, this was was priced well and I am able to use all of my old Minolta lenses. (remember Minolta ha!).  Delivery was prompt, packaging was great,  The above package also includes an extra battery (not Sony branded, but still works fine).  The special package also has an extra air blower from the vendor, which is somewhat unnecessary, since the Sony box also includes one.Ok the good stuff - bottom line is picture are great.  LCD screen is bright, but a little hard to see in bright sunlight.  However, that is about how all LCD screens are.  I was quite impressed with the digital View Finder though.  With moderate lighting or day shots, the VF is barely discernible as being digital.  If feels like I am looking right through a standard DSLR.  It is more apparent in darker settings since the VF is actually producing it's own light, which is ok since you want to see your subject matter.Keep in mind that you really have to read the manual. I tried to figure the setting out and it took me a couple of hours to really understand where things were.  But the manual really lays it out pretty clearly and would have saved me about 1.5 hours.Ultimately pictures are great.  My early 90s Minolta lenses work perfectly although my Minolta 70-210 zoom focuses focuses slightly slower than the new 55-200 Sony lens.  My Minolta 50mm lens though focuses instantly and I didn't notice any lag.  I do prefer the 50mm Minolta lens to the 18-55 though since it has a larger aperture.  Still all the lenses work great and I was able to get some excellent shots.

The menus are intuitive and quick to learn.  Photo quality is top notch and beyond what might be expected in this price range.

Rea", "ReviewID": "R2G568M65BO0OO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My sister really likes Sony cameras, she has the A55V and uses it all the time.  i wanted to get her an updated camera but couldn't find a  bundle like this one for the A65, plus the camera was newer.  Well she loves the A58 and the extra lens, but a few things were wrong or missing.  Forst, no Sony camera, while that is not a deal breaker that is supposed to be part of this bundle.  Also the battery is a Vivatar and does not charge in the Sony charger, in fact the Sony battery is 7.2v 11.5Wh, 1600mAh, while the Vivitar is 7.4V 1800mAh 13.3Wh. Quite a difference and when she put the Vivitar in the charger all it did was blink and never charged.  Lastly the SD card was not a Sony as shown in the photos. it is some crazy off brand called Bandwidth which neither of us could find any information on.  A call to Amazon lead nowhere, just return it for a refund and reorder the bundle.  What to receive the same things again?  The camera works, she is happy but beware of Focus Camera because what you see is not at all what you get as far as the accessories go.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Missing Items From Package", "Author": "Kasia Kozak", "ReviewID": "R1WASLEN0XRGA4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera and was planning on using it for an upcoming trip that I am going on. However, upon the camera's arrival I noticed that the Sony carrying case that was listed as coming with the package and that was shown in the picture was not in the box. I would hope that for the amount of money I spent on this package, that Focus Camera would be able to include everything they promised in the package. It would be greatly appreciated if Focus Camera would fulfill their end of the deal by shipping the camera bag to me, and if they do so I will change this review to reflect such actions.

I have taken and sold many wonderful photos over the years, including weddings, family photos and grads shots, with these cameras but digital is the standard now, so I decided that as I move toward retirement I would make the switch.  I am also excited to see this will work with some of the old Minolta/Konica Maxxum lenses I have but never used, since I never had a camera body that would use them.This is a pretty decent camera body.  It is simple and light weight.  Some photographers will not care for how light weight, but I know some older folks that will really appreciate this.  I also like how it fits in my palm so well (I have smaller hands) while still allowing me to easily utilize manual focus options of the lenses.  I am still getting used to the idea of an ISO button, instead of a F ring, transfer to digital is otherwise pretty flawless.  The auto functions make standard family and travel snapshots a breeze, you will get good exposure and color memories with little preset effort.  I have other preferences, so I will utilize this less I suspect.The lenses that come with this are more then adequate for a hobbiest or beginner.  Luckily there are some nicer lenses A bayonet lenses produced by Sony, I am sure I will be buy at least a couple more, but for the price this is a heck of pack.I have to say, the only down was the camera case.  What got is for a Sony Camcorder, doesn't even begin to fit the body and lenses purchased in this pack.  I will be reselling it as quick as I can and purchasing a nice backpack style with room for lenses shortly.  I have not shot more than some test video, looks and sounds good on my Samsung smart tv, not much else to add on that just yet.  I did also buy the remote button, glad I did.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "blaxrs", "ReviewID": "R2VTPAXGCT89PX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOTS of stuff, all seems to be good, and everything came quickly, which was really nice.
