{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent bang for the buck", "Author": "RealHappens", "ReviewID": "RP1U1D15C93J6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is only the second digital camera I have purchased & man-o-man what an improvment it is over the previous one. First is the absolute ease of operation. You can start shooting out of the box without spending hours deciphering the instruction manual. The controls are big enough for quick & easy changes which is nice for a compact camera like this one. The flash even has three brightness settings you can choose. Start up takes about a second or so and it is ready for action. Zoom is quick lever activated and even the eye sight zooms with the screen for the optical zoom portion. One of the better features is also one of the more simple aspects of the camera. First, for memory it uses a SD card & not some camera only flash stick that cannot be used in anything but the camera. My palm computer uses the same SD card which makes for easy picture transfers over wireless. The other nice thing is the fact it uses regular double \"A\" batteries. I realize that they don't last quite as long as \"premo\" camera batteries but if you're on holiday and the camera battery dies out, it is WAY easier to snag AA bateries in any store verses looking all over for a shop that carries a fancy camera specific battery. This camera also accepts rechargable batteries. The pics are great & even in 6megpix mode with anti-shake, the shutter cycles quickly. Low light shots are NO problem with or without the flash. Shutter speed and other finer individual, non-automatic adjustments are possible for people with a flare for creative shooting. Not bad for a compact 6 mega pixel digital that is just over 199 bucks. The video recording is unreal. Terrific video quality but the sound gathering capability of the camera leaves alittle to be desired.  The camera can even be used as a voice recorder only. It can be hooked up to your TV & set to an auto slide show mode. Darn thing even has selectable sound effects for different functions.

Sturdy metal body. Easy to use with some manual controls. Usefull Anti-shake feature. Good pictures and movies. Unlimited movie recording in high quality (640x480, 30 fps). Shutterspeed: 60(!) - 1/2000 sec. Quick start. Quick Auto Focus. Nice picture in a low light situation, especially with manual twist. With all those great features, the EX-Z110 comes in a quite crisp price, compared with other brands in equal features & quality.If it's noisy in high ISO, well, all pocket cameras are (if you want great pictures in high ISO, buy DSLR!) Don't worry, with a little learning on the manual control you can manage a good picture too. I found also the manual book is incomplete, though you can find the complete version in the CD (.pdf file).I'm very satisfied with the camera so far.", "Date": "October 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "You won't be sorry.", "Author": "Cosmo Kramer \"The Real Peterman\"", "ReviewID": "R2EMPEG5NATWLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was used to my old Canon Digital Elph S200 and was comfortable with that size and weight.  But it was SLOW.So I decided to use my birthday money from my mom to replace it.  Unfortunately, Canon quality has gone to hell, so I did research and happened upon the Casio.What a great camera.  Nearly the same size as the digital elph, about the same weight, but better features, better interface.  The physical viewfinder is a little small for my eye, but the LCD screen is great and the camera takes wonderful pictures.  It is much faster and needs less shutter speed to capture images than my Canon did.  I was able to take pictures of moving fish in my fishtank with this camera, for example.  The canon would always blur the fish.And even using the digital ZOOM on full on this camera gave a great closeup picture of my cat's head with fantastic detail.  And this was in snapshot mode.  I'm sure if I messed with the features, it would be even better.  I don't use digital zoom as a rule, but I figured I'd test it to see the quality, and it is very high.The Casio has lots of features I haven't explored yet, but I'm sure I'll have fun playing with them.And I like the AA battery feature better than the Canon cartridge system.  AA alkaline can be used whenever needed, and I bought some NiMH rechargeables for normal use.Anyway, at only $220 you can't go wrong, even if the rechargeable AA batteries are extra cost.  And I added a Sandisk Ultra2 SD card with built in USB interface for the most convenience and performance, and I'm happy.  Isn't that what matters?", "Date": "January 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "All below & more", "Author": "Willy", "ReviewID": "R20C2AQBYAVRX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of shopping around before I bought the Z110 & couldn't find any other camera with the equivalent features at anywhere near the same price. The movie mode in highest quality is simply unreal. It's a memory hog, but worth it.. especially in these days of 2-3 gig memory cards. On the review sites there are other cameras ( especially the ones using MPEG4 encoding) that show \"artifacts\" & such, not so with this camera. My mother, after seeing the movie shots, returned her brand new digicam (5 megapixel, 640x480 30 fps MPEG4) ASAP and bought herself a z110! Remember, a pic is worth a thousand words.. but a vid (especially with sound) is worth 10,000 pics. The body is durable metal and the SD card can be accessed without opening the battery compartment. With all the scene modes, manual settings (iso, focus, aperture, shutter, etc.), real time histograph and such, there's room to grow. I also like to photogragh scenes in low light without the flash and found that, despite the max aperture of F 3.1, it's surprisingly capable. Willy's recommendation: get this camera.", "Date": "December 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Unexpected great value!", "Author": "Ibok", "ReviewID": "R19J0O1ZJGUQL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been averaging a new digital camera about every year, have always stuck with the 'big' boy brands before and wasn't even aware that Casio made cameras.  Was I ever surprised to find the features, quality and price they offer in a very respectable lineup!  After using the EX-Z110 for several weeks and several hundred photos, I must admit I am VERY impressed with the results.  The photos are very sharp no matter what the MP setting, and at first I thought they were a little bland until I realized that these were the most natural, true-to-life pictures I'd ever taken.  The camera is exceptionally easy to use with 3 different AUTO settings, plus enough manual over-rides to satisfy any advanced requirement.  This is the first camera I didn't have to depend on the owners manual to navigate the menu's, they are very logical and well thought out.  It has features I've never seen before like a triple sequence self-timer mode, really ideal for family photos as invariably someone always has their mouth open or eyes closed, now you can choose from 3 similar photos taken at approximately the same time (it goes through a 10 second countdown per shot).  If I have any complaints at all it would be the video mode as at 640 x 480 it stays with 30 fps in both normal and Hi-Quality setting, I use HQ to get the best possible resolution and this REALLY uses up the memory so it's best to have 512MB or 1GB cards available on any serious outing.  I then have computer software to convert this to a more compressed format like .WMV.  All in all I would say that this technically advanced compact camera can successfully compete with anything out there in its class, and for me this is going to be a 'keeper'.", "Date": "February 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "To say anything bad would be nitpicking!", "Author": "D. Hanscom \"OregonNative\"", "ReviewID": "R2X0E5QKJ6Y5TW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited over a week for my Ex-Z110, and it was worth every minute! What a technological wonder this camera is! I have had a Canon Powershot S30 for about 3 years, and it took good photos, if the lighting was good. The indoor pictures were rather sad. The Casio however takes incredibly good indoor pictures, with the Anti-Shake on you absolutely stop movement. Every photo of my dogs chewing their bones was perfect! Low-light overcast winter ocean photos also good, with the Anti-shake on I might add. Color is great. I read some reviews somewhere and on CNet that were rather negative about this camera, and I can't figure out for the life of me why. I couldn't ask for a better point and shoot. It's also very small. There are thinner cameras, but there's got to be a point where a camera can actually become too small. This one is a perfect size for my medium size hands, and slips right into my shirt pocket. Zoom indoor photos are great. I did have to reduce megapixels to 4 so that I didn't immediately use up my 128mb SD card, and photos are still perfectly sharp. I did not have to read directions to start using features. I did read directions to figure out how to insert batteries and card. I'm using Energizer e2 rechargeable AA batteries and an Energizer fast charger, which are working wonderfully. As I said, I cannot find one thing wrong with the Casio Exilim EX-Z110 digital camera. In fact, it is a dramatic improvement over my \"old\" Canon Powershot, and also satisfies my appreciation of nifty technology!", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great, small, easy to operate, though some drawbacks", "Author": "Yana E. Murphy", "ReviewID": "R3IWR94LHLIRCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If there was a 4.5 stars rating, that's how I'd rate it. Pretty darn good.The Good:*Easy to operate. Universal icon controls make the owner's manual unnecessary.*Small enough to fit in your pocket*Light enough to stay there all day w/o being weighted down*Photo quality is great (see my flikr page: [...] Almost all of the recent ones were taken the past couple of weeks with the EX-Z110.The Not-so-good:*It's small enough to fit in your pocket... and not in a soft carrying case. Consequently, my LED screen is scratched (somehow). I've carried my cell phone in my other shirt pocket for a year now without a scratch. My guess is that the LED screen is very soft to scratch in only 2-3 weeks time.*The LED screen is not very clear/bright. In sunlight it's very hard to see. I've had 3 Canon digitals and their screens are bright enough.*It's so small that when it's on I'll accidentally hit the Menu button and have to toggle it off again.*The owner's manual is only 16-17 pages long, in English. Then follows 6 other languages. It could have given a bit more details on some of the settings, like \"Easy Shot\" for which there's no explanation that I can see.Outside of these few minor complaints (except for the scratches on the screen), I wouldn't hesitate buying this great, little camera.", "Date": "March 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "The Perfect Digital Camera!!", "Author": "Cally \"Cally\"", "ReviewID": "R3LG8CEG6BT32J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reluctant for years about buying a digital.  I have always used SLR's and am extremely anal about the quality of my pictures.  I like the ability to zoom, use different filters, stop action and enjoy the perks SLR's offer.  However, I wanted something small and less expensive to fit in my purse and have with me all the time. I did a lot of research and it paid off big time.  The camera is light, small and compact.  It is about the size of a pack of cigerettes.  Perfect size.  Cameras too small are hard to handle and can break easily and too big would defeat my purpose.  This one is perfect.  Another plus, it runs on AA batteries so I can use rechargeables which I like. Plus, AA's are easy to find anywhere.  With my 1 GB memory card, I can take hundreds of pictures.  The screen allows for reviewing pictures taken so you know if you need to reshoot or how to reshoot right there, unlike SLR's where you don't know what you got till it's developed.  There is a slew of features that are like the filters used with SLR's: Sepia, black and white, red hues, green hues, and about 20 more.  There is the best shot feature which quickly and automatically sets up the camera for what you are shooting for (twilight, bright background, stop action, special effects, portrait, macro, ect.)  The macro is unbelievable.  In fact, close-ups with this digital are just as amazing as the ones with my $600 SLR.  Plus, you can go to manual for creative control of aperture, focus, ect.  It has all the benefits of an point-and-shoot camera: compact, quick, easy, self-focus and the benefits of a Manual SLR: filters, manual focus, aperture or shutter adjustment, macro, ect. This camera was able to shoot fireworks, the moon beside a mountain in the daytime, freeze a water drop in mid-air, take close-ups of flowers showing the pollen grains, and the list goes on. And the quality! It is so crisp and perfect. I don't even use my SLR anymore. This one is so perfect it replaced it. I'm not kidding.  What do you want to photograph?  Close-ups? Scenery? Family portraits? Pets running around? Night shots? Panaroma scenes? It does it.  Whatever you want to shoot, it shoots with perfection.  The quality, the variety of modes, the ease of use, I am just amazed.  This was the best purchase, along with my iPAQ, I have ever made in my life.  The price is crazy low for what you are getting. Oh, and the user guide, you don't need it. Everything is so easy, that you can start using it with all it's features right out of the box.  It is easy to transfer to the computer. Everything is easy.  You also have a video function if you want to shoot a brief video. The sound and picture are very crisp and impressive.  Just remember though, video eats up major memory so this is good for a quick scene but don't plan on filming your daughter's one-hour piano recital.  Another perk that I love, love, love is that when you do shoot video, you can play it back frame-by-frame on the camera and pick a scene out of it that you want to be a picture. Want a picture of your dog jumping in the air or your daughter in the middle of a cartwheel? Video tape the scene, play it back, pick the right moment when they are mid-air, and voila! You now have a photo at the exact right moment.  I am the picky consumer. With this camera though, I would pay twice as much for it. It is that great. I love it so much.  I couldn't of dreamed up a better camera. It's worth it. Buy it. You won't regret it, I promise you.  Do remember to get a memory card with it, also. They are worth it. If you are a big picture taker like me, I would suggest 1 GB.  While the camera has a great battery life, I would still get rechargable batteries. You can take pictures for hours and hours and they literally last for days with this camera, but I still like to use rechargeables only because they eliminate the need to buy batteries all the time.In summary:Buy this camera! The quality, size, features, price, cannot be beat.  There are no negatives to this thing.  Congratulations Casio.  The EX-Z110 is truly superlative product.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Super fast shutter speed!

I had a Sanyo MZ3 2.0mega pixel but seriously I couldnt see any difference on indoor pictures. Under flash/auto condition, both camera produce similar pictures. However, the sanyo makes a better focus in micromode and when flash is disabled.  Z110's outdoor image is great. I use the best mode to take a lot of great sunset picture. This camrea is heavier than I expected but I really like heavy camrea since its more stable when you take snapshot.  By the way, the CCD of this camrea is produced by Casio itself and its size is only 1/2.5 inch, while Casio EXZ110 is produced by sony and the size is 1/1.8 inch. So I expect Z120 will make a better image.  I bought it online for $169. It doesn't fair to expect too much.

I sail in the Caribbean quite a bit and wanted something that was small in size, but would offer high quality pictures. Despite some negative reviews, I looked at this (in person) at a retail store and then found an online deal and bought it. Bottom line? No regrets. Solid value for the $. If it gets lost, stolen or destroyed, it won't be a huge expense to replace it. It's also very easy to use, with a super oversize view display. I did buy a special case to fit it (the camera is very thin) and a screen protector, since I had read about problems with scratching of the screen.
