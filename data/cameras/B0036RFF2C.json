{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Camera Standard", "Author": "Netname", "ReviewID": "R2JTRCWLFQFVD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this from Officemax for $100. Offers good specifications for the price.Pros:- Rubberized buttons- Comes with a plastic faceplate case/cover (pretty much useless, but it's the thought that counts)- Auto mode adjusts to everything- Angled shoot button- 5x Optical ZoomCons:- Screen is a tad bit slow- You have to go into the menu to change modes, no simple button to press.Standard point and shoot cameras these days come with 10mp, with 3x optical zoom. But this one comes with 5x optical zoom and 12.2 mp, which was a deal maker for me. Rubberized buttons feel good, adds to the durable feeling. And the angled shoot button is really interesting.The picture quality is great with the 27mm wide lenses. Its no Schneider lens, but it gets the job done well. 12.2mp doesn't really help the camera out, and saving the picture between shots take a bit of time, unless you have a fast SD card. But you can always lower the megapixels down to 10.[...]The auto mode takes care of everything. It adjusts for shots at night, fast movement, colorful, and faces too. Good for the everyday user. You can also set it in manual mode if you want to pick the mode yourself. The camera even tells you not to take the picture if someone is blinking!Overall, i chose this camera over the several kodak cameras at the same price point. It is the camera we have all come to expect from Samsung.Tip: Buy a class 4 or higher SDHC card. It saves the pictures faster.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad, could be better though", "Author": "S. Rose", "ReviewID": "R35CYDI5GSOM5F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After having had the magenta 7.2mp Samsung S73 for three years, I decided it was time for an upgrade. The S73 took crisp, excellent pictures - the only major issue I had with it was the frustratingly slow flash recycle lag in between taking pictures. I figured I'd go with another Samsung since I'd been so happy with my last one. I got this one brand new from eBay, and was excited to try it out.I've had it for a few weeks now and used it on several occasions, and here are my conclusions so far:-The image quality is slightly disappointing. Though not terrible by any means, there's no consistency on whether you'll get a decent-looking picture or a blurry one. I found Auto mode to be lacking, so I just programmed my own settings to have a better chance at taking good pictures. Good lighting helps, of course, but I wish that the camera didn't have a tendency to blur the edges of subjects in photos no matter what the lighting conditions. Indoor photos in low lighting I found to come out the worst. I played around with the settings which helped a little, but not much.-My S73's pictures were a lot better. Yes, I know, one of the most common misunderstandings of picture quality is that 'megapixels aren't the determining factor in picture quality, the lens is,' but for a 12.2 mp camera with a Samsung lens, I expected the photos to be at least as clear. They weren't. The best quality picture I've taken so far with this camera is still not as good as the best quality photo on the S73.-Video quality is good, a lot better than the S73. It's not jumpy and grainy and sound quality is fine.-It has a 'beauty mode,' which is sort of like a built-in photoshop portrait mode that makes you look your best. I like how the pictures come out, but there's no denying the soft, 'photoshopped' look of unblemished everything.-I'm very impressed by the aesthetics of the camera and by the battery life. After charging it for the first time, I haven't had to charge it again in weeks.-The flash recycle time is great - no annoying lag and 10-second embarrassing wait while your friends stand by impatiently to see the picture you just took.Overall, don't get me wrong, the image quality isn't terrible, I just wish it were crisper. I was probably spoiled by the S73, because I did notice that it took better photos than most of my friend's cameras ;). I'd recommend it as a starter camera, but not if you're used to high-quality photos.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT SHOCKPROOF", "Author": "spongesparrow", "ReviewID": "R24J8FMSD3VSVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The videos and pictures are pretty great.

The packaging was well done too. It was all in bubble wrap within a small box with the label firmly on the outside.Now having said that I'll move on to the actual deal here.It is a bit interesting as to how you get to each thing you want to do, but it isn't difficult so long as you explore. Exploration is the key with the digi. It does many things, but you need to be willing to get out of your comfort zone as maybe you've been with prior cameras.The quality is quite beautiful. It keeps surprising me and that is no exaggeration. I'm quite happy with it.You know what is also a great surprise? The battery life on this seems to run incredibly well despite viewing photos and how many you're taking.I will say of course that not all things come with the digi, but that I found out is a minor inconvenience. I received the battery, the charger for the battery, and of course the digi itself, but there was no usb cable to connect to say a laptop for example. However, it hit me I could easily get a memory card reader, which turned out to be even better than having had the usb cable. I got a memory card reader for under 7 dollars online and there are many that range in that price ranger or higher, but still even under 15 or 20 dollars. So if you get no usb cable, don't fret. You paid a reasonable price on the digi and you will on the card reader too.Oh speaking of memory card. The digi only works with SD cards, not the micro SD ones. That too is a minor deal since those are sold just about everywhere now and for very cheap.So as you can see, I'm a happy girl. My first purchase on Amazon and things went well.

I just could not part with my Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ5 6.0MP, 6x optical zoom.....But our community newspaper requires at least 8MP in any photographs submitted for publication. Here in the No. Ga. Mountains, we have abundant wildlife and plants that I enjoy photographing. So I was forced to stop using my beloved Panasonic.I've been using this camera, which was ninety nine dollars in Sept. 2010 here on Amazon.com, for several months now. I am packing it back up and using my Panasonic again. The pictures the Samsung turns out just cannot compare to the clarity and color I get from  my old Panasonic. I dislike that you have to go into the different menus to change a setting. On the Panasonic, I just turn a dial.I'm giving the camera 2 stars for: rubber dust proof buttons (but the icons on the buttons are impossible to see in certain light) and the ease of setting up the camera. But that's all the good I can say.I volunteer in animal rescue and there are situations where the dog or cat we are trying to capture and re home is not in close range. Yesterday, I had the optical zoom at it's max and the picture was so blurry and fuzzy you could barely see the color of the black & white dog. The anti shake was on, by the way and I was braced against my car. The other photographs taken at say 15 ft were just not sharp. I double checked to ensure it was set to auto/smart and not some \"beauty\" mode....The pictures were acceptable but would not make a good FOUND poster. I had dumbed the MP down to 8.0 MP, good enough to publish but not worthy of publishing in our community newsletter.The plastic clip on face on the front of the camera, serves no purpose that I can see....I wanted this to be the perfect camera and IF it had taken half way decent pics, that would have been great. But as it stands now, again, it's going back in the box.....Does not serve my purposes at all ! Truth be told, I should have tried it out immediately upon receipt and then sent it back.

Takes very good quality pictures during the day (I haven't tried it at night, but flash works well in dark spaces); good zoom, very custom-friendly settings and controls. The best feature and the reason I bought it for work is the possibility to have a voice memo for each picture. The disadvantage - You have to select setting for voice memo (4 clicks) for each take/picture. You could have a memo for new pic you about totake or for the one already taken. You just need to enter setting and pass these 4 clicks every time you want the voice memo. Still, I would recommend this camera and Samsung products in general.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "very goods", "Author": "Pedro Jose  Arellano P", "ReviewID": "RVGH0TOBPEI50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera has gone very good. actually I have no negative to this camera. has very good image and zombies. the pictures are sharp.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "SAMSUNG IS THE BEST", "Author": "Danny", "ReviewID": "R83VM2N8F3HTG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best of the best was what I was looking, it fits my needs, I recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good point & shoot for the money, no frills", "Author": "Michael Afflerbach", "ReviewID": "R1F38Z3HPTHLJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a reliable, good point and shoot digital camera for a good price.  There were a couple of requirements which made this Samsung fit the bill:1.  I wanted to have at least 8 MP.  This is for work, to document things.  I am not making posters of these items, I just needed something which was more useful than my iPhone for actual photography.2.  I wanted to have regular, normal SD cards- no need for proprietary memory like Sony, etc.3.  I wanted to have a rechargeable battery.  This one has a specialized USB plug but could charge the battery already in the camera-- so there is no specialized charger unit (just the cable).4.  I wanted some zoom, but mainly wanted a cheaper camera.This Samsung fit the bill for under $60.  The pictures have been good and it has a largish screen on the back (for the class and cost of camera in this class).Overall, a decent 2nd or 3rd camera to have around.
