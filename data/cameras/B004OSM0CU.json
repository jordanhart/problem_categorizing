{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good camera but....", "Author": "DK", "ReviewID": "R2KESE2TBDI37U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I initially bought the Mobicam DXR camera and monitor for my two year old.  Now I monitor my newborn with the additional camera.  The monitor gives you the option of cycling through each of the two rooms/ cameras every few minutes.  However, when I do so,the sound invariably drops out so I can't seem to hear either of the babies when they cry or wake up. I have contacted the company and they seem to have had other customers complain about the same issue.  I believe they are trying to resolve the problem.  Other than this issue, I am very satisfied with the product. It is easy to install and the picture quality is great.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Product - Poor sound", "Author": "Gonzalo Alberto Gomez A", "ReviewID": "R154APIF3L4BX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi I bought this product because recomendations, and it's good, the range is good, the connection was simple; and my wife love it. But the sound coming from the camera its too low and with a two years old children that's not good; because she didn't cry and We can't hear her what's she saying until she start to scream.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Syncs up seamlessly. Great purchase.", "Author": "A. Hansford \"Airielle\"", "ReviewID": "R3A93YVM22WJTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this as a replacement camera when the original broke after it hit the floor on too many times. We had no problems getting it to sync up with our system. I love that we were able to replace the camera rather than having to purchase a new system. I gave this 4 stars because the on/off switch which slides is a bit cheap and that was what ultimately broke in the original camera. Other than the switch this camera and the system as a whole is great and I would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product, but.....", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1OD0ZSQBPD81Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera does not include a proprietary battery. Consequently unusable until a battery is ordered from Mobicam. Mobicam was very helpful. Battery should be included or offered when camera is ordered. No indication of necessity of ordering a battery on web sites.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love,", "Author": "Kristina", "ReviewID": "R2XRXE8UFKDJ16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera... This is # 2, that we leave on our boat .. Great camera system, clear pic good sound.  Battery life little short though, maybe 4 hrs.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great monitor camera", "Author": "msm1379", "ReviewID": "R2CN660BTS4Q1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We got the MobiCam to replace our Motorola that broke after 3 months; we absolutely love it! The MobiCam has great resolution, day & night, the sound is great and I love the 2 wAy intercom. Setting up the additional camera was very easy, and it's easy to toggle between rooms with the parent unit. My only critique is that the power cord on the camera is a little short; to be able to mount it where you can get a good \"bird's eye view\" of the crib you will need a small extension cord. Otherwise, it's a great camera/monitor.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Carrie R Toscanelli", "ReviewID": "R372VDE5BFCEIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this video monitoring system, bought a second camera for my second child. Works great, no complaints. I would have given it 5 stars if the camera had a zoom feature and if it came with a rechargeable battery.
