{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful camera in a small package!", "Author": "mle991", "ReviewID": "R1MNGWN84LBFVC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***NOTE (4/24/12):The charging port for this camera uses a micro usb port, so if you are on the go or in the car you can just charge up the camera in the car with your car charger for your phone. Hope this is useful information for everyone :)***This camera is straight out fantastic. I have been using it for about 2 and half weeks now and it takes really crisp and sharp pictures. Although sometimes the pictures don't come out great but that is to be expected. This camera looks exactly like the previous model the WX9, i think the only difference is the screen size and the better digital zoom on this camera (WX50). Outside in the sunlight this camera performs flawlessly and the shutter speed is really fast with very little shutter lag. If you use the regular auto mode it tends to be faster at taking a pic and processing it right away, but if your use the auto plus mode the pictures comes out better but it takes about 1-2 second to process but it is well worth it and it is fast to move to a next shot right away.I absolutely love the sweep panoramic feature, it is one of the main reasons that I wanted to get a sony cybershot camera and because I have previously owned the cybershot T70 camera which was fantastic as well. Another feature that I like is the background de-focus mode. It creates images that resembles a DSLR with the bokeh and blurred background. Although it is not perfect everytime but it is consistent meaning about 8-10 shots would be perfect with the blurred background and the other two shots would be blurred too much or too little or just in the wrong place. I used a DSLR as my main camera but when I travel or go out with friends I like to bring along a smaller camera for the convinence. I initially was going to buy the HX9V but that camera was a little too bulky for me although it is absolutely great at producing sharp images (I've actually used my friend's HX9V for 2 weeks so I do know what I am talking about).Aside from all the great features I will deffinitely buy this camera again or another sony cybershot, except for the lower end models because of their horrible shutter lag.I have also posted some sample pictures too if you want to check out how well it performs :D***UPDATE 4-18-12This camera has performed fantastically over the last few weeks. I want to mention that I experienced the lens being stuck twice. It's not like a lens error message thingy where the lens wont retract but it was like when I hit the power button the lens won't come out. Through my experience, I just pulled out the battery and reinsert it and the problem was solved. Like I said it only happened twice but I solved it the same way twice. This is why I get hesitant buying the cameras where the lens goes in and out.Another feature that I am really getting addicted to in this camera is the HDR filter and the TOY CAMERA filter. The HDR filter is really neat and it comes in handy if you want to get more details out of the picture where the lighting is dim or where there are a lot of shadows. There are THREE (3) sensitivity levels that you can adjust. For me I only like to use it on the low level because I find that medium and high is just a little too much for me. The low setting works great and it doesn't over power your images with the \"HDR\" effect which I know that most people aren't a fan of. Its just another way to get more out of your shot with the high dynamic range, but thats just me, i find it really handy.As for the TOY CAMERA effect, I use it sometimes but not very often unless I want to give my pictures a vignetting effect. Thats what the toy camera effect does, its just gives the picture a vignette which is pretty good looking in some photos but I wouldn't used it too much because it makes your picture a little bit on the darker side and you can lose some details. I prefer the sony's toy camera effect over canon's because it doesn't give that bluish greenish lomo color to the images. You also have different options for it such as NORMAL, COOL, WARM, GREEN, and MAGENTA hues that you can add to the effect. Also you can use these effect while recording video which is also a plus, just dont switch to video mode but instead just hit the record button while in normal shooting mode with the effect selected.My final thought of this camera is that this camera is really good, you just have to be creative and use it wisely. The camera itself is just a tool, it just helps express your creativity and capturing a still moment in time.

The F30 set the standard for low noise, low-light photo quality in small-sensor cameras and its performance has been difficult to beat --and I've tried, and purchased, several cameras since the Fuji.  The Sony Exmor R sensor appears to be the low-light performer I've been looking for and so I purchased and tested both the Sony WX50 and the Sony WX150 for comparison.The specs for the Sony WX50 and WX150 are virtually identical except for the optical zoom range (5X Carl Zeiss lens vs 10X Sony G lens) and sensor size (16MP vs 18MP).  I fully expected the WX50 with its 5X lens and 16MP sensor to have a slight edge in image quality due to simpler optics and fewer megapixels in the Exmor R sensor.  What I discovered was exactly the opposite.I took several photos of the same low-light scene using each camera set to ISO 200, 400, 800, and 1600 in the widest angle setting (no zoom).  When reviewed at 1:1, the WX50 photos showed considerable noise at ISO 400 and above (800 and 1600 were nearly unacceptable) whereas the WX150 was extremely noise-free even at 800 (with 1600 being quite impressive).  The WX150's images were even slightly better than my trusty Fuji F30 --finally!  There was no comparison --the WX150 lens/sensor combination provides noticeably clearer, lower-noise images at high ISO than the WX50.  The WX150 has better shadow detail and clarity despite its longer zoom range (usually a compromise) and higher MP (higher MP sensors are usually noisier).However, I was most disappointed in the WX50's video results when using the optical zoom.  When zooming during video recording, the WX50 lens is very \"loose\" and wobbles side-to-side during zooming in and out.  The result is that the video image jitters left and right when you're watching any video sequence with zooming.  The WX150, on the other hand, is rock-stable during zooming (which should be more difficult with the longer 10X zoom) and indicates that the WX150 has a more robust lens mechanism than the smaller 5X zoom in the WX50.  Just to be sure I didn't have a sample defect, I purchased and tested a second WX50 camera and it had exactly the same lens wobble.  Very disappointing!Overall, the Sony WX50 is a good performer compared to similar cameras from Canon and Panasonic.  The Sony Exmor R sensor is an excellent low-light performer as advertised and finally gives me a reason to retire my trusty Fuji F30.  Whereas the WX50 takes very good photos and video, I have to rate the WX150 performance as excellent in comparison.  If you desire the lowest image noise at high ISO settings along with a stable lens during video zooming, then the big brother Sony WX150 is the way to go.  Yes, the WX150 is more expensive but to me the performance difference, including a longer optical zoom, is well worth it since we're still talking about cameras under $200 (edit 1/5/13:  at the time of this review, the WX50 was selling for $119 and the WX150 was $169 on Amazon. It looks like the WX150 price has recently gone as high as $228 due to demand).", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera will not always power on", "Author": "samboy", "ReviewID": "RN9LN6D58AWK3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has a showstopper issue:-Occasionally the camera will not turn on correctly.The green LED will light up, but the lens will not come out and there is no power to the LCD screen.The camera will not respond to any button (green LED remains lit) and one is forced to remove the battery and reinsert it to get the camera functioning again.I was able to consistently reproduce this issue (3 times) by attempting to power on the camera every day. Typically the issue would happen on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th day. If the camera does power on correctly, then it seems to keep doing so until you put it away for a while.The main reason for purchasing this camera was to have something on hand that you could quickly take photos with. If the camera doesn't power on correctly then your photo opportunity is probably gone by the time you \"fix\" the problem by reinserting the battery (along with the fact that the battery compartment doesn't look engineered with this amount of use mind).Given that two other reviewers have also encountered this problem; I would recommend that would be buyers hold off any purchase for now........I have sent my camera into Sony service and will update this review with any new findings...........Other than that, this small camera is really nice; takes great video and reasonable pictures for the couple of weeks I had the camera in my possession.Update 30-May-2012==================Sony repair center called 23-May-2012 and explained that they could not reproduce the problem. I let them know that they needed to leave it off for a day, turn it on etc and usually after 3-4 days they will see the issue. I expect that they turned it off/on a few times in a row; which if it works the first time will continue to work.Not sure why they called, since they did not apparently care about the extra information I gave them. The tracking number of the returned package shows that it left their facility on 23-May-2012; so they didn't even wait one day to try again. They don't seem too interested in understanding what may be a flaw with their product (hopefully something that a firmware upgrade can solve down the road). I'm willing to help them; but they don't seem too interested..........We now have the camera back again with no repair/investigation done. It worked the first and second day; but today again the camera hung when we powered it on. We haven't even taken any photos or video with it.I'll call Sony Repair center again and have it sent back a second time...... Obviously not a very satisfied Sony customer at the moment.Update 8-July-2012==================Another cycle with Sony repair center completed. Again, they sent the camera back to me unfixed with \"problem not reproduced\". I went through the same procedure and powered the camera on every day and on the 4th day, the power on hang issue was reproduced again. I took video footage for each day to demonstrate the issue with Sony.Sony service center is scheduled to call me next week to discuss the issue further.....We have had this camera since April and I starting to get very concerned that Sony is not serious in helping us with this fault....... It's really worthless to us if it cannot reliably power on; We can't get Sony to fix/acknowledge the issue; we can't return it now and we can't sell it so we may end up simply having to \"write it off\" and buy another brand.I'll update the thread with any further progress.Update 2-September-2012=======================We received the camera back from Sony repair center on 24-August-2012; this took much longer than the last two times we sent the camera in. So we were cautiously optimistic that Sony was looking into our problem a little more seriously and the DVD disc with HD video showing the issue probably helped convince them that we did have a problem (I guess they must be inundated with people going out of their way to send them goods that are working fine!).Anyway, they did replace the logic board in the camera and it has now powered on every time without an issue over the last several days. I'd be curious to know if the new logic board includes a new firmware, but I couldn't find anyway to check this out.Sony did eventually resolve the issue; primarily due to my persistence in sending back the camera multiple times. However it has taken around 4 months to get a working camera (now with 7 months warranty left). Other than that, it does look like a nice little compact camera!", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love love LOVE it!!", "Author": "MizB", "ReviewID": "R22TYRWBXTDJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received today and put it to the test...Took some indoor photos in low lighting and photos came out great.

However, I decided to sit down and compare specs this time. I replaced my last Cannon camera because I had it almost 8 years and it was time to upgrade. The main reason for my upgrade was that I had to hold the capture button about 3 full seconds before it would take the picture. I love this Sony camera. It takes the picture immediately after pressing the capture button. The video feature picks up sound well. But the best feature is it's ability to take pictures in the dark or at night. This flash has to be the brightess ever. My friends marvel at how well the night pictures come out.

However, little particles of dust can be seen through the lens making it neccesary to blow air into the camera to remove them to avoid pictures with little dots in them.Battery life is something to keep in mind with this camera: Altough many cameras can work a whole day with a single charge, this camera can't. It is mandatory to buy an extra battery to enjoy all the great features in this product.  Manufacturer is aware of this characteristic since they include in the box:\"Remember a spare battery\", which usually doesn't appear in the promotion logos.The excesive consumption of batteries can be caused by the increase in temperature during filming.Anyway, I like pictures taken with the DSC_WX50camera, good quality and useful features such as the 3D sweep panorama which usually would require several shots.Size: This camera is a bit small for regular sized hands but ths can be fixed by ussing the wrist strap supplied.Overall this is a good product that I would recommend to purchase, with an aditional battery, of course.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "J.L.", "ReviewID": "RRC11YP9IKYIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera. When you are purchasing a point and shoot I think you need to be mindful of your expectations. Point and shoots aren't meant to be perfect cameras but a quality one should take nice pictures. This is my second Sony Cybershot with a Carl Zeiss lens. I absolutely recommend any Sony camera with this lens over any other! I have tried Olympus, Fujii, and other brands of cameras and I still go back to the Cybershot with Carl Zeiss.This specific camera is excellent in low light, bright light, action shots, and just about any other condition I have tried out. 95% of the time it autofocuses on the right part of the picture (which is great for the type of camera it is). The images are sharp, clear, and true to color. The intelligent auto setting works great.This camera is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to have to mess with settings. It easily uploads photos to your computer. There is a easy setting on the camera so you can have a very limited menu which I think is perfect for those who aren't tech savvy. And if you are tech savvy, you will be just as happy with this camera because there are many settings you can change if you'd like (though not necessary).Battery life: I have been using my camera just about every day now. I have taken thousands of photos with it. I am surprised by the battery life. I keep the camera on intelligent automatic, auto flash and my battery usually lasts about 2-3 days. If most of my pictures need a flash the battery does run out after about a day and a halfDurability: Unfortunately I dropped my camera about 3 feet and it hit a metal chair then hit the floor. I was so mad at myself and it was only the first week of use! I turned on the camera and there were no issues! Everything works just as always. There isn't even a scratch to be found.I honestly haven't found any negatives about this camera.

We just returned from a trip to Ireland and Finland and this camera took stunning landscapes, night views of the city from the plane,and bright, clear photos  both in and outside of people we met and places we visited. The panoramics were fun and the zoom is excellent. While the variety of settings took some time to figure out, they allowed for a remarkble amount of control in the type of picture we wanted to create. I took pictures of 400 year old headstones and read them on the computer when they could not be read by the naked eye. A fellow traveler lost an earring and I was able to take blind shots by sticking the camera under a cabinet and the auto focus helped locate it for her.  My only negative comment is that the camera seems to turn off quickly between shots and I think the turning off and on seems to take a bit more battery power than my previous Sony. This might be in a setting that I have not discovered.

The WX50 is very responsive to turn on, with fast shot to shot times and virtually no shutter lag. I was able to take 10fps in burst mode although you will have to wait a few seconds for the camera to process the frames until your next shot.Photo quality has very good color and sharpness up to 8x10 prints, although as you increase the print size or zoom into the pixels the images do have a painted look to them. My Canon Powershots appear to do better in the detail and sharpness department as the image is enlarged.Like the WX150, the WX50 uses HDR High Dynamic Range technology which is awesome for a \"point and shoot\" camera. At one click of the shutter release button the camera quickly takes multiple exposures of a single scene at varying exposure levels to create one image with greater dynamic range. The camera also has an impressive array of scene modes and custom settings.Video is recorded at full 1080p with stereo sound, what is neat about this camera is that you can capture up to 10 still images as you are recording video, I've found myself using this feature very much. The WX50 also features a very entertaining slide show mode with 4 different styles that displays the photos and videos on the camera with built-in music and effects, very cool and impressive. Gone are the boring slide shows with 35mm Kodachrome and a projector! I use a mini HDMI adapter to plug the WX50 into my television's HDMI input that works great.The WX150 has a 10X optical zoom while the WX50 only has 5X, although I didn't find myself missing the extra focal length for my intended use with these cameras. In handling between the two Cyber-shots the WX50 is smaller with rounded edges and felt more durable than the WX150, the WX150 feels more plasticky and I would tend to treat it with more care.The WX150 is a very highly rated and fantastic camera, although in actual use I prefer the WX50 simply because it has a more solid feel to it while capturing equally impressive images.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "Andr\u00e9 Rocha Ferreira", "ReviewID": "R3P314POZG70G6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Firstly let me tell you I'm not an expert photographer or anything like it. I like a simple camera to take some decent photos, which is compact enough to fit in my pocket.This camera is pretty sleek, it is very light and compact, I do like the controls, the screen and the look and feel when operating it. It has many features, several scene presets and it's quite fast to point and shoot. However... this all falls apart from the moment I take the memory card and review the pictures on my computer. I've read so many good reviews about this camera and the pictures it produced, that I was completely shocked when I reviewed the pictures. To be quite honest, I get sharper images with my iPhone than this camera. It does a decent job focusing near by subjects, either people or monuments, but when you try to photograph a landscape it's misery. You first review the pictures and you think they're kind of neat, but once you zoom in to 100% they're useless. They're too softened, there's no sense of depth in the objects in there. I don't quite see the point of having 16MP if you can zoom in to see the details.I haven't even tried it a night, all the picture I took were in plain daylight so I can't rate it's capabilities in low light environments. Maybe this just wasn't the camera that suited my needs, maybe this just something you take with you to have a couple of pictures with your friends, but I did expected a whole lot more, specially after reading  the reviews all over the internet.

There is almost nothing this camera can't do well for it's size.  The combination of the f2.6 Zeiss lens with the Exmor R CMOS sensor is great as it does exceptionally well in low lighting without the flash.  Video quality is also excellent, and Sony's superb image stabilization is almost like having a tripod or a steadycam.  This is also one of the only ultra compact cameras to feature stereo audio recording, which as a musician, is extremely helpful.  Plus, you get all of the cool Sony features like the original and still the best sweep panorama, background defocus (for a DSLR-like shallow depth of field),  and hand held twilight mode for extremely low light situations (I use this more than any other feature).  I've compared this with my older HX9v (replaced by the HX20 and HX30) and performance is very similar, although the WX50 is a bit faster at processing.

It uses a micro USB cable for charging which is quite convenient with most phones,etc already using the same.Dislikes: This may be simply an adjustment, but using auto mode the flash was too bright sometimes.

Its amazing!  I've never gotten such great concert shots from this type of camera, usually the lights from the stage ruin everything but not with this one.I also like that it knows which advanced mode will best suit the situation you are in, so if you dont want to pick for yourself it will do it for you.  Although you still have the option to make your own choices and there are a number of filters that you can apply too, like water color, or black and white which can be fun to play with.It also has a pet feature which I am completely excited about- I have for the first time been able to get pictures of my small furry black dog that looks like she has a face!  Usually she looks like a black blob and we just know that she is there, but this got her whole face with great detail.I also enjoy that it keeps track of the date that the photos were taken for me, but not as an imprint on the photo but as a very simple file name on the card- I can be a little OCD when I do photo albums and I like to keep things in order on vacation so this helps me remember.I didnt like that the camera didnt come with a case, but that was easily fixed and it didnt bother me enough to make me dislike the camera itself.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely 5/5; perfect camera; total value for money", "Author": "RG", "ReviewID": "RRPWQDREVHOT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was a phenomenal purchase.

I'll consider buying an additional battery for it, but am leaning toward returning it.  Bottom line, the battery life was much poorer than I had anticipated, and I don't think there's much I can do short of dragging around spare batteries.I already have, and am thrilled with, a Sony DSC-H70 and a spare battery which I purchased on this site.  Unfortunately, it's not pocket friendly. The new DSC-WX50 looked like a more portable equivalent (16mp and 10x zoom), with the added benefit of Full HD 1080 video.I didn't anticipate that the WX50's battery life would be this poor.  I calculated that the battery life equated to 13 Full HD videos averaging about 4 minutes each, plus 20 still pictures and 2 panorama shots.  That's 22 pics and less than 1 hour of HD video, total.  Sorry, that's just not good enough, unless you're dragging a bag of batteries around.  My DSC-H70 more than doubled that output on a single charge, and recently survived an all-day track meet on a single battery.Full HD 1080/60i movies with the DSC-WX50 were consistently stunning, and superior to the 720p movies I took on the same date, under the same conditions, with my DSC-H70.  If I do keep the DSC-WX50, it'll be for the movie quality. The WH50 gave incredible detail of each runner at the opposite end of the stadium, with almost no visible camera shake.  The action from that distance wasn't as clear with the H70.Pictures were better on the DSC-H70.  The DSC-WX50's pictures were good at first glance.  But when loaded and viewed on a large monitor, they were disappointingly fuzzy on faraway details, both in smart/intelligent/auto mode and in landscape mode. My guess is that the H70's G-series lens is superior, because the detail is better with the H70.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I had hoped for better", "Author": "T.

That is except for the slanting inward at the tops of my pictures.  But all of my Sony's have done this.Mostly I use it with the \"Easy Mode\" which makes everything automatic.  The menu is a mess for me since I haven't learned it.  I am sure the advanced settings would be nice but I don't have time nor the need for this.  For sure in this mode it will not take nice pictures of the moon like my very old Kodak would.Problems. (1) Once in a while the lens will not retract.  Pulling the battery and replacing it fixes this.  Other times it won't go out.(2) Every time I have deleted photos using my computer the camera has troubles sorting an lining them up.  Most times I have to pull the battery to get it out of the 'assessing' mode.(3) The On/Off button is very sensitive and it comes on in my pocket.  Unless I hear the energizing noise tone it invariably leaves me with a dead battery.(4) The View Photo's button is even more sensitive and often the screen is on for long times, enough again to run down the battery.(5) Battery life is shorter for this camera than for my previous Sony's  I do not have a second battery but if missing a picture would cost you money then you should have two batteries, one all charged up and ready.(6) The case is all plastic and has warped to leave gaps.  I am tempted to glue it shut for more water proofing.  My last two Sony pocket cameras had tape holding buttons on or things shut, this one with the plastic case is worse still.  My daughter has a WX-150 and hers also has the gapping case warping problem as well as a friend having warping problems with his, either a WX-100 or a WX-180.(7) Every now and then it changes modes for no apparent reason. For me this means lost time figuring out what happened and then how to get it back to where I had left it.So far at then end of a year I have taken 4613 pictures with it.  So far so good.  Both my first Kodak and my first Kodak went over 10,000 pictures.  The Kodak was still working fine until it got killed by my beagle dog knocking it on the tile floor. The Sony lost some necessary buttons that I hadn't taped down.  The 'wheel' switch is the worst, I am ready to tape this one also although it is plastic and might be anchored differently.I did have some problems ordering this camera as it came from a vendor instead of Amazon.  I knew this but Amazon has had to collect sales taxes for Texas residents and their vendor did not.  But the vendor 'sat on' my order for more than a week before it was shipped.

There are a few smartphone camera apps that \"do this\", but this camera actually does it well.Some creative freedom:  Don't get me wrong, this is no DSLR, but if you look in the manual, it actually teaches you how to position yourself and your subject to get common photographic effects.  The camera usually recognizes what you are trying to do, and adjusts the aperture, shutter speed, etc. accordingly.Cons:This is already becoming an older camera.

Both use the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec with the Sony generating MTS files and the Panasonic M2TS files. While the Panasonic generates the better quality video, the Sony was impressively close for the price. For non-important events, I leave the Panasonic home and just bring the WX50. While smartphone cameras have come a long way, they are still a ways off from dedicated digital cameras such as this model. The startup time and shutter speed was a huge reason I went with the WX50.

I did have to read about the upload to my computer procedures.  However, my machine already had the software (I have a Sony laptop), as this camera defaulted the upload using the Sony Picture software.The YouTube review was spot-on.

Low light it's good set at 800iso.

The last good point to mention is that the charger has a USB port that plugs into a wall socket or into the computer or can be plugged into a car charger, just like a phone, so that's convenient.

Compared to my previous camera, this DSC-WX50 is fantastic.  My favorite convenience is the automatic macro on/off.  I use this camera to document hardware at work, and that involves both wide views and close-ups.  The automatic settings detect the proximity of the object and then apply macro focus as needed (compared to manually setting this as I had to do with my previous camera).  This feature appears to be available on most newer cameras, however, and is not a special feature of this one.I found the battery life to be superb.  I took a photo survey of some equipment that involved acquiring about 90 consecutive photos with the view screen on and using the flash.  The flash was always ready right away following a photo, and the battery remained at full charge.I have had difficulty acquiring good panorama photos.  It is not clear how fast the camera should be turned during panorama mode.  There is a nice graphic on the display screen that indicates the required camera orientation and the direction in which to turn.  The (minor) problem is that the speed at which you turn affects the piecing together of the photo.  If you go far too fast or slow, then the acquisition will stop and you will receive a notice.  I have found that most of the time I think it is a good shot because it looks good on the display screen, but the actual photo (when viewed on a PC) clearly shows misaligned sections.

I cannot be the only one that has experienced this or maybe I am the only one that cares because I use this camera for video.I have contacted Sony about this problem and had the lens replaced twice and the third time I sent the camera in they told me there was nothing wrong with it.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Sony Camera", "Author": "Ag", "ReviewID": "R109YUGGP6Q637", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality product.

My old camera was a tank. It took great pictures for being so outdated and withstood many beatings from my toddler. The only reason I wanted to replace the camera was the lens cover would no longer open entirely on its own. I needed to push it open with my fingers and would often forget to do so, ruining my picture.I wanted to love this camera just as much, but I'm a little under-whelmed by the WX50. The special features are really cool, but honestly I'm not sure I will use them very often.Here is what I don't like about the camera:1.)It is made of plastic and feels like a feather in my hand. I realize this is how cameras are made now days, but I'm afraid it will break if dropped. I will do everything in my power to keep it away from my child.2.) I feel the colors are a tad off.3.) Most of the pictures come out blurry. This could very well be operator error or simply the fact that 99% of the pictures I'm taking are of a busy 18 month old that doesn't believe in sitting still for longer than 2 seconds. If you're reading this and know a solution to this problem, please share!!4.) On several occasions the camera would not turn on. I pushed the power button and nothing happened. I had to take the battery out for a few seconds and then the camera would turn on.Overall, the camera is okay and I would recommend it. It takes the pictures faster than my old cyber-shot. The images that come out clear are very sharp. Just be careful not to zoom in too far. Like I said earlier, I love the special effects. My dream is to own a DSLR, but its not in the budget right now. Maybe this dream is making my expectations too high for a point and shoot.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Moment Distroyer", "Author": "boy965", "ReviewID": "R1FK1ZZ8L8CK0X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The picture quality is great at certain conditions spatially outdoors.

Unfortunately mine has some problems and yours will too...All my problems, but don't fret if you don't see yours in here! The internet has more info on it maybe!disclaimer: I am no professional. My solutions are what I did to make this camera work/ keep it working. Doing any of the following stuff puts everything at risk. My suggestion is to not do any of them, and work hard and buy a more expensive camera without these problems. If you still decide you like my solution and go forward with it, you're doing it at your own risk.1) the lens extender doesn't retract/close all the way when the camera is shut off.my solution was: turn camera on again and off again and hope it retracts all the wayNOT A SOLUTION: put any pressure on lens or force it down a little. This will break the super fragile camera forever and you probably can't get a new one from the warranty if you do. In fact don't even touch the lens or its extender or you'll likely break it. Not kidding.2.a) the lens is super fragile, one bump against the super fragile extended lens will break itmy solution was: treat it more cautiously than newborn baby. You can drop a baby and it will survive. This camera will not. ESPECIALLY if the lens is extended when the camera drops.2.b) the lens might extend in a travel case if its bumped too hard or if the button somehow gets hit. The super fragile gears in it and its motor can't handle that kind of strain and it will be ruined.my solution was: make your own case with an inside lining of bubble wrap to protect against short falls or approximately \"leg high\" accidental drops, so that there is no way the button will be hit... but IF it is hit anyway you have made your own case so that the lens can FULLY extend inside the case and won't touch anything anyway... Thus ensuring it won't break. <33) flash is worse than no flashmy solution was: learn to turn off flash. Its not that simple in the dark? Either use a flashlight or stop taking pictures with no light source...4.a) camera software doesn't install on my computer properly, ALSO my SD card doesn't work in my computer after it has been put in the camera and the camera was turned on with the card in it.my solution was: Tough luck chum, that is the future for you. Its not bad enough that things don't work on their own and break super easy. Now having them come into contact with each other breaks them. You have to scour the internet and figure out your problem. Sometimes its simple. It took me registry editing and about a week and a half of working 2-3 hours a day to fix mine. Here's another note. If you have a webcam on your laptop and you disable it or uninstall its software AND unhook it that could be part of the problem of why your camcorder won't install the software. Also remember to try different USB slots because that was another problem. Also get the software online and install it directly because, again, the camera wouldn't do it properly for me and just kept freezing my OS.4.b) My SD card still doesn't work? What the hell? This is a mountain of crap I already read through and I just want to take some simple freaking pictures?!! How do you rate this thing as 4 stars?!my solution was: Your SD card is probably 30mbs and type 6. Get a better one. Only the latest technology \"works properly\" when conjoined... and I use the words \"works properly\" veeeeeeery loosely. You bought a camera that takes amazing pictures and movies with surprisingly good audio. You knew \"SOMETHING\" wasn't right with the price when you bought it.5) I turned on my camera to take a quick picture to share with a friend and it wouldn't turn on? I bought this thing to take quick pictures?! It can't even do that?my solution was: about every 4th time this thing won't turn on... so just pop the battery out *super CAREFULLLY!!* so as not to drop the also super fragile battery which will break the thing with any significant fall on a weak spot, then pop the battery back in and there you go! Too bad you missed your chance to take that quick picture and the moment is gone now.my Solution #2: get a good camera-phone and use it for those kinds of pictures because this camera is too fragile to be handled so quickly, and can't be reliable for that kind of (catch the moment!) or (I only have a few seconds!) picture taking.Conclusion:Perfect poor-man's camera. Has a bunch of weaknesses that drive its price down in the market; but to someone who wants super quality for low-low-loooow price and will protect it like its your only child, and the child has a skin condition that lets it's flesh rend and tear with just a simple touch in the wrong spot kind of fragile child... lets call it super fragile paper thin plastic piece of Chinese crap... from any and all realistic-use-situation perspectives.PROS: super cheap super quality! all the bad things drive the price down into affordable for you! Woohoo!CONS: super ultra mega fragile with problems you have to constantly and I MEAN CONSTANTLY consider because they will break it sooooo easy fragile problems constantly never-blink!! I'm pretty sure just THINKING too hard will break it.(joking, but no... really...)Final words: Buy this because you want cheap camera with ultra quality and you'll babysit it better than your own child. Don't buy it for \"quick pics\", or \"if you don't know how to edit your computer's registry\", or \"if you don't know what the difference between a 4 sd card and a 6 sd card\", or \"if you don't know how and/or don't have a program that can edit HD videos and records\", or \"if you don't know how to mess with deinterlacing\", etc...Personally I love it and the pictures and the movies I get from it, but I expect it to break within 6 months from normal use/dust/electromagnetic interference from a common cellphone or something. One year warranty gets me another that hopefully doesn't arrive broken that will last me maybe 3 more months if I'm lucky.Hope my review helps! <3 love love and good luck! <3(~secretly I bought it to film arousing videos and artwork... *cough cough* pornography *cough!!* and I'm a bit saddened I can't risk letting fluids get on the lens sometimes, but the quality makes up for it~)", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lame, no memory card", "Author": "Evan Williams", "ReviewID": "R2A0KMHZKQITN4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's a digital camera!
