Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2ULW217SH229P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera new on eBay a few months back. Everything works well, however the camera does seem to burn through batteries. I purchased the Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries (4-pack) and charger from Amazon. The camera however still says the batteries are low even when they are fresh from the charger, however they seem to last at least a week or more before recharging. The camera takes good pictures even when you haven't read the owners manual and once you get used to the features and settings it takes great pictures. If you buy this camera save your self some money and hassels and buy the Sanyo Eneloop batteries and charger you'll be glad you did. Not as easy to use as my old Sony, it is never the less a great camera if you accept it's limitations...", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sanyo VPC-S120 Digital Camera", "Author": "Oh-Henry", "ReviewID": "R1DAL489W7OG9H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sanyo VPC-S120 Digital Camera - I bought this camera one year ago. It takes excellent digital photos and video clips. Great camera overall. The one issue is when I had the camera for six months and the tiny part that closes the battery compartment broke and I use masking tape to keep the battery latch closed.If I could improve this camera I would make the memory larger to make longer videos and improve the latch on the battery door to stay closed.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "patetic...", "Author": "Ivett Castellano", "ReviewID": "RJIY4DDZTZ4ZL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i order this item from my country and i receive an used item and that was supose to be new. that's really sucks", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "cheap faulty camera", "Author": "Rami", "ReviewID": "R2KTXSCRH4Y24T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the seller failed to mention that the camera had to permanent 1 inch black spots on the screen and that the USB charging cable was missing", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "worked well for 2 months", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R16VXA5WPNYWFF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "then it got stupid on me no more i can say about it except that this review requires three more words now one two three", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broken plastic", "Author": "Katty", "ReviewID": "R23N5IF4FNUY8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera takes acceptable pictures but I bought in \"very good condition\" but the true is that the plastic frame is broken which makes the Item virtually useless. besides looks like an old camera.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product for a good price", "Author": "Quanda Ellis", "ReviewID": "R1HNYK8C2K6GH0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera for a good price.

Spink", "ReviewID": "R2YNZX8P92EU5C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a reconditioned Sanyo S120 camera at a price under $30, thinking it would make a great gift.  The audio prompts and numerous features like face and smile detection initially impressed me, as did its 12.1 megapixel specs.  But I found the battery life exceptionally poor, and the quality of its color and photo resolution inferior to a 1.2 megapixel camera I had a decade ago.  Low light photos are very fuzzy and have lots of noise artifacts, but photos taken in daylight on a shaded porch were also unacceptably unsharp, and colors are muted and poorly rendered.  The camera's tiny body may be an asset but the controls are too small for my fingers.  And even if the camera is turned off an accidental press of the arrow rocker button on the back will activate the battery-devouring display, even if the camera is in your pocket or in a soft case.  The manual provided with the camera does not even mention how to use many of its features, including selection of its file quality modes.  There is no optical viewfinder and the large color display is hard to see in direct sunlight.  Save your money.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very bad buy.", "Author": "Rebecca J. Hughes", "ReviewID": "R3BD8U9YXMUW3N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to use in my classroom for various projects (I teach art). I have a Canon Digital Rebel, but I did not like bringing it to school every day, so I used part of my classroom funds to purchase this camera. There is NO recharger. I used it 3 times and the batteries ran out. I replaced the batteries and used them up in about the same number of uses. I bought rechargeable batteries and the camera does not register them, even though I have tried various permutations and combinations of charging times and places. By the time I had gone through all this it was too late to return it to the store, even though I had the receipt. I am now stuck with a camera I can't use and funds gone that would have better been spent elsewhere. I am hoping that Sanyo will be able to help me with this problem, but I don't hold out much hope.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "VGA-size Video Clip at 30 fps\nSmile Detection\nBuilt-in memory approx. 50 MB\nSanyo VPC-S120 12.1 Megapixel Digital Camera", "Name": "Sanyo VPC-S120 12.1 Megapixel Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-9AtQoXLL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00415Q63A"}}
