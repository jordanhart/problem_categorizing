OK, have not tried out the range.I like the feature you can charge the camera, built in battery ,and it will run for 4 hours. Really helps for moving it around from place to place till you find the right right location. Then you can plug it in.My next purchase will be an cable to extend from the receiver to an outside antenna.I have not tried this at night yet....The focus is easy, just turn the lens, so you can adjust it. Most of the cameras don't have that.I'll write more later as I do more testing.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Stab at a Security Camera", "Author": "K. Gibbons \"pcnetwrx\"", "ReviewID": "R115W9ST225R4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this from another site for about $40 including shipping. I wanted visibility to my driveway and knew that this was rated for indoor use, but felt if I sheltered it enough, it should work in Arizona out under my eave. So far it is doing pretty well, and even survived one prolonged and windy rainstorm. It remains to be seen whether it will survive an Arizona summer.There are a couple of issues with it to take into consideration. First, the mounting bracket does not really provide enough room, especially if you are wanting to leave the camera plugged into power. I had to shave and modify the power connector somewhat to even get it close to pointing the direction I wanted because the power connector would interfere with the wall I was mounting it to. Second, since this is a wireless system, it is subject to interference. While you regularly see sporadic blips of interference, our microwave really does a number on the picture. And it appears that maybe even a neighbor's microwave causes some interference because the pattern looks similar on the interference even though ours is not running at the time. And the sound on mine leaves a lot to be desired and is largely unusable due to the constant buzz that is there, sometimes much worse than at other times, but always present to some degree. But I have mine mounted about 100 feet away and going through 2 walls. I have it running 24/7 and select the appropriate input on my TV whenever I want to see what's going on out there or when I am expecting someone to arrive. It works good enough for me, and I am considering buying another of these systems just to get a second camera for my back patio. In that case, it would be nice if I could control the receiver with a remote to select which camera I want to view, but I will need to manually select it if I go that route.I will update this review if/when the camera survives the summer here.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "Mike Canton", "ReviewID": "R2JICLNQ8919CH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "really enjoy these make me feel more secure and I plan on getting some more sets at a later date", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor design and performance", "Author": "WantDecentValue", "ReviewID": "R1UC2Q385Z49CQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even only 20 unobstructed feet away this thing makes a screen full of noise.  I knew it was junk as soon as I saw that the power switch on the receiver was upsidedown.  You push down to turn it on.  And you need a little flathead screwdriver to power on/off the camera.  ErgoNOTic.  But I could live with hard-to-use controls if IT WORKED.  I can't think of a user application where this would be useful.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for being wireless", "Author": "Lance Michael", "ReviewID": "R37HQCLRLWADMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item from Ebay but is the same model number, i got it for 35 bucks and it works really well. It is wireless so it won't be a constant perfect pic and since its on 2.4 ghz I had some interference when I set it up in my man cave. I hooked it up to my upstairs TV and it works very well with no major pic issues at about 100 feet, I will be doing more wireless testing but great product all around. The rechargeable camera is awesome! If you buy this item and have short range pic issues start unplugging  wireless devices such as other wireless cameras, baby monitors, even some wireless keyboard and mouse! I might buy another!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$77.00", "Features": "Night vision wireless color camera Built-in 11 Infra-red LEDs to aid nighttime vision.
