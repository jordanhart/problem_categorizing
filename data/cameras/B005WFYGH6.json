Besides, it was the 1st DDNS I ever set up.And I'm just an average computer guy.Conclusion: Easy to set up.Edit:Setting up email server and ftp server was a bit more of a pain, since the format to be used is very strict. It's still doable for average users. But the result is great. The many options give so much control over the camera, such as setting up the number of pictures sent by emails or to the ftp server once motion has been detected. It's also possible to set up a time interval during which one can deactivate the motion detection alarm, to avoid receiving too much emails or pictures.2nd, the camera itself:Produced a very sharp image with just the right luminosity when viewed on my local network.The fps slowed down a bit when viewed on a remote network.The night mode is just great. The infrared LEDs are really bright, which gives an excellent picture in pitch dark.There is also a Moon Light mode, which works best at very low brightness, and improve the picture by increasing the light sensibility, while decrease the FPS. I was told about that feature by the customer service.Conclusion: Does what's it supposed to do, and even better than that.3rd, the customer service:I'm always reluctant to contact CS, but I gave it a shot, and it was so worth it.When I asked questions, the agent always gave me relevant and practical answers, while offering additional tips related to my questions. (Moon Light mode, using an ac power surge to turn off the camera when I was looking for a software-oriented method, and how I could get a IR illuminator pointing at the ceiling to be able to use the night-mode without turning on the red LEDs)Conclusion: highly recommended product!Problem: this is the first ip camera I buy, and I'm afraid I may be disappointed with any model I buy in the future compared to this one.Note:The camera is connected to a pretty slow wifi connection (90kbytes/sc), and remotely accessed from a faster connection (about 500kbytes/sc), which may explain the decrease in fps..", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "As described", "Author": "Michael Goldstein", "ReviewID": "R3OEK3FSZFBGN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera arrived and I had it working on my network within half an hour, despite the fact that I have a 5 year old Lynksys router that required a little more manual work than normal.  I'm also a Mac user, and this proved no handicap.My neighbor, who owns a Logitech system, oohs and ahhs about the video quality.  I like the fact that I can put it in DVR mode using the microSD chip and not worry about keeping a computer on.On the second day, I set up web streaming.  This was slightly confusing at times, but I kept plowing through and with just a little trial and error got it all working within 45 minutes.In the end I never did need Sharx Tech support, so I can't comment on it, but the setup is really not bad at all, imo.Really, the only problem I had was that I originally ordered a 32GB microSD card.  I learned later that 16GB is the largest it supports.

Diramos \"Techie Monster\"", "ReviewID": "R31BYPW854JE2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had purchased an older version of this camera in 2010 from amazon.com. It was easy enough to set up however, accessing it remotely from your iphone or from another computer outside your wifi network can be a challenge. And this is where great after sales service comes in handy because the manufacturer's tech department will email or call you persistently just to make sure that you got everything done.But it doesn't end there.  I lost my manual after I moved a few months ago. The warranty has expired as well as the phone support and when I called them for instructions on how to set up the remote access, I admitted that I lost my manual. And they did an amazing thing. The tech support confirmed that indeed my warranty has ended but they will send me, by PRIORITY MAIL AT THEIR EXPENSE A NEW MANUAL. Further, they asked me to coordinate with them to ensure that I am able to set up my remote access correctly.I have never heard of this kind of outstanding service from any other tech company - these guys are passionate about supporting their customers. I'm a corporate trainer and I run service excellence programs and I always start off my workshops with an anecdote about a true example of excellent service - I've always chosen some Malcolm Baldridge awardee but going forward - I will always be talking about Sharx and their cameras.Oh and by the way, the product is excellent. I'm always out of town, and the longest I've been out is 5 months and the camera works without fail - clear, sharp and the alarm system works (it starts taking pictures every second once it detects movement and stores it in the SD card and for good measure - starts emailing you the pictures in case the intruders decide to tamper with the camera).I kept it in my closet for close to a year since I have been travelling yet this morning when I plugged it in, it powered right up and picture was clear as the first day I got it. Brilliant little camera made by brilliant folks.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sharx SCNC2700 camera review", "Author": "Kopperhead67", "ReviewID": "R2ICBC37288VTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very clever gadget... an impressive product.Very good image quality for a security camera, including the night vision, and going IP/wireless is a great way to avoid having to drill through walls and run wires throughout your house. It works as advertised to access via the Internet through a web browser, tablet or smartphone (in my case, an iPad and iPhone.)  Only caveat is I haven't been able to access the camera through our company's network, which I believe is due to the corporate firewall - something to keep in mind if that's how you plan to monitor the camera while at work.What really impressed me are the additional features.  Video recording with a Micro SD card works perfectly, generating a series of 10-minute long Quicktime files.  Depending on image resolution, it's no problem to record continuously for 3-7 days with a 16GB card.  But to save disk space and to avoid having to wade through days' worth of files, the camera also has the ability to record only when its internal motion sensor is tripped.  My favorite feature is that the camera also can, when the motion sensor is tripped, instantly email me a series of still JPEG's with the image of whatever tripped the alarm, and it works flawlessly.  All of these recording and email functions are user-customizable with a wide variety of settings.An important warning: setup of this camera is not trivial, on the contrary it is quite complex.  Be ready to devote several hours to it, going slowly through the user manual and calling on Sharx tech support if necessary.  If you are impatient about setup or leery of diving into the details of your router's programming, this is not the device for you.  But if you're willing to give it some time and effort, the manual is outstanding - very thorough and accurate - and the phone tech support is great as well; you're talking to a true expert on the camera rather than someone overseas reading a script.  30 minutes of phone tech support per camera is included.All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this camera and think it is more than a fair value for the price.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Picture but Setup is Difficult", "Author": "Tallpilot", "ReviewID": "R2BNJCAF4MRVZ9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is somewhat of a good news and bad news product.

I purchased it originally to use as a fish cam for my fish tank (I know that probably sounds really lame because this is a really expensive camera). Once we realized all of the cool things it could it could do we set it up on the front porch since that's where we get the most activity. You should know that because of the IR lights if you set this up to point THROUGH a window it will not work - the light bounces off the glass and into the lens giving you a terrible white out and making the camera pointless at night. However, if you can mount the camera in such a was as the small ring around the lens to be right up against the glass it will actually block out the light being reflected by the lights and you will be able to see a picture with the night vision. It won't be as clear a picture as if you weren't looking through glass, but it will do the job.The BEST feature about this little camera is that you can set up what portion of the frame you want to trigger the alarm if it detects movement. This is VERY handy because we have it set on our front walkway so every car that would pass in front of the house was setting it off. With some quick adjustments to the motion detection frame and you we no longer get email alarms unless someone actually comes up our walkway, which is awesome.There are a ton of features on this thing, my only disappointment is that sometimes the video playback is glitchy and not smooth, even set at the highest frame rate, which kind of sucks for 300$.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little internet accessible camera with a very good manual", "Author": "R.

Love the fact that it has wireless connectivity for 2 reasons. The first being, very convenient to place it wherever I want in my home network. The second, unlike typical baby monitors that use radio frequencies, this is a WiFi signal. I like this because there's less static when viewing live video, not to mention no chance of interfering with the wireless router or any other signal associated with it.Pretty convenience for me to go to work and watch our baby from my office simply by either opening the browser or by using the iPhone app I've installed. Plenty of infrared LED's around the lens which pretty much means amazing infrared image with very little distortion. Just right for when I wanna watch the little critter move around when he's sleeping! =)Overall, I'd recommend this camera to anybody especially if you intend on using it as a baby monitor.

I'm not overly technical so it wasn't working when it should be working according to the directions.  I reached out to the Sharx Security and they promptly responded.  The issue ended up being an issue with my router.  The camera was perfect.  They were kind enough to help me with a \"work-around\" that solved the problem and now the camera works beautifully.  Great image, even in the dark when it switches to infrared mode automatically.The product is top notch and that's what you pay for.  The extra customer service from Sharx Security was what blew me away.  They met me at my level of technical understanding and helped get the problem solved with a high level of professionalism.

Even then I had to restart my router before the camera would stay online.The network interface on this camera uses the same MAC address for both the ethernet connection and the wifi. This means that once the wifi is configured, you have to immediately disconnect the ethernet and cannot ever use the ethernet port again without massively confusing your network router.  This detail is not mentioned anywhere in the documentation, and I only realized it when I saw the same MAC showing up under both wired and wireless devices on my router.I have yet to be able to connect to anything but the motionjpeg stream, and the camera seems to keep crashing on a regular basis.

This camera has changed that. The picture quality is great, both during the day and at night. I bought this camera specifically to use on a wireless N network for some home security. During my research I read how wired ethernet is the way to go for cameras if you can (which this camera will do), but for my camera placement that wasn't possible. Following the instruction manual I set the camera's bandwidth settings and framerate and it has been working wonderfully. I have it set to record full time to my network attached storage drive. Make sure if you are setting up a NAS to follow the manual to get it going regarding the correct path, this has also worked great since. I had a few issues pushing the camera a little much by making it record too many high bandwidth streams at once (continuous recording and alarm mode recording at the same time), but after sorting that out with tech support I have it working reliably again.The real reason for this review is the support and the instructions that come with this camera. The camera itself is a quality product. However I have never seen tech support that will answer you back so quickly, that knows their cameras inside and out, and that actually wants you to be happy with their product. In addition to that their manual is well written, maybe a little technical for some, but it is very thorough and won't leave you guessing. I have never had an instruction manual for any tech product this good.While most people are only interested in the product, which I think performs very well, it is good to know that if you have any problems they are more than willing to help or even exchange your camera for another one until you are satisfied.

I have a stand alone Lorex system, and the video quality is what I consider good, but it can't compare with the video quality of this camera.My main purpose for buying this camera was so that I could keep an eye on my house when I'm away. With my iPhone this camera does all that and much more. I haven't tried all the features yet, but looking at the feature set I can't really think of anything that it doesn't cover.I set this up with a Linksys E4200 router or I should say the E4200 set it up for me. The only snag I hit was getting it go work with my iPhone, but after a little careful reading I figured out what I was doing wrong. I also received an email from customer support with some very helpful suggestions.Customer support is the best. If you want a camera that does it all with beautiful video quality look no further. I know all my future cameras will be Sharx. As with anything, especially anything that has a lens you get what you pay for. If you want a so so quality camera there are plenty of cheap cameras around.I also picked up an app for my iPhone that is much better than using Safari. I'm using IP Cam Viewer for an iPhone app. and it works great.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "We use it as a baby monitor", "Author": "David M.", "ReviewID": "R3VYQV6JWQ9FQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HOW:Tested and works WITH SOUND on Iphone 3gs/4/4s (via \"baby monitor hd\" app) Ipad 2 (via baby monitor hd app) Macbook air (via Safari) Desktop (via Firefox/VLC/IE) on local networks and over the internet via 3g network. This was the PERFECT solution to our baby monitoring needs.The wife can watch our feral child climbing the walls via her laptop iphone or ipad, and even run just sound in the background while using other apps.  I can check in from work or whatnot while I'm out and about.You can even set it up to take daily pictures of your growing child! I am planning on putting together a projecting using the daily photos!When we took a weekend trip we set it up to notify us when it detects motion via a picture in our email, great peace of mind while we were on our trip. If I could afford it I would have one in every room of my house.WHY:You gotta keep your eye on babies these days. Why? Because they're lying, thieving, cheating criminals.If you don't believe me, just look at the way they reach for car keys. You'll laugh and think it's cute until one morning, you wake up and the crib's empty and the Honda's gone, and by the time you call the police, Junior's halfway to Mexico, giggling and gurgling there in the driver's seat, because he's had this planned all along.What I'm getting at is that you can't let these little hoodlums out of your sight. Not for a second. That's why you need this camera. Because these little ones may not be able to form words, but you better believe they can hatch full-blown heist schemes if you give them just a second of privacy.Also note worthy:Sharx support staff is INCREDIBLE! they even answered my questions before I bought the product and gave me tips on how to set it up!

It's very nice and you can make out all details very well.  Great range.  There's not a lot to say other then it works both on my internal network and from outside via safari browser.  I have not bought a generic app for it yet, but that would be much easier then opening the browser of my iPhone and then navigating to the IP address, entering the log in and password, etc..When you set it up just take your time.  I would for once read through the instructions and determine what your initial set up is with your OS system and wi-fi network/router.  If you follow the instructions step by step, you will have it set up in a few hours.  I say hours because I was going back and forth with settings and such, and also had not taken much time previously to work with settings on my router -- so a new learning experience.  If you are a complete novice, the instructions plus emailing option to customer service should help.  They responded each and every time in great detail.  Half the time I just got impatient and emailed them but in waiting for response, figured it out.  So again, take your time and you will have this up and running.
