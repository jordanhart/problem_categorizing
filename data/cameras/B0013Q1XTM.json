It looks quite convincing when mounted high enough over the front door that people cannot see it up close.  It has a perpetually blinking red light in what looks like a lens, which helps.  However, unfortunately, the sliding cover that is supposed to slide over the battery compartment on top of the camera had no stops on the camera we received.  It slides right off the camera, and there is no way to make it stay on.  We had to use duct tape in back and hope that holds it.  Either the one we received was defective, or the camera is manufactured in a bad way -- so that the cover may be prone to slide off, with no way to attach it to the camera.

Am pleased with how authentic the unit looks from a distance and the red-blinking light.Up close it looks pretty cheaply made.  Comes in a plain box with no instructions, but does include screws and plastic inserts for use in the wood to control expansion.  That last part is a nice touch.From a deterrent stand-point, the cheapness factor does not come into play.  (Who cares if it looks cheaply made up close when it's realistic from a distance?)  Where the cheapness factor does come into play is the battery cover.  May be my unit, but had a fair amount of difficulty getting the cover to align properly and close.PROS -  Visually highly realistic.  Compliments bronze/brown house paint well. -  Red blinking light. -  Installation hardware. -  Price.CONS -  Battery cover seems cheaply made.COMMENTS ON COMMENTS -  Some claim company is shipping a different unit.  Not mine.  Received the same product as pictured on Amazon. -  Battery life.  Too early to tell how good/bad.  Installed the unit one month ago and as one would hope the light is still blinking. -  Sliding cover sliding off.  Not mine.  Nice interference fit. -  Awkward position of battery cover.  Agree, but where else could the manufacturer have put it?  Think when time comes to change batteries, will simply unscrew the swivel pivot nut and remove the entire camera.  If battery life is short and I tire of changing them, will likely go the no-light route.UPDATE:  04-04-2011-------------------First set of AA alkaline batteries lasted three months.
