The flash works great and all my indoor pictures have turned out excellent - definitely on the first shot.  The 5x optical zoom and very nice 3\" viewing screen are features that put it above other cameras in this price range.  And the zoom works great too - got some great closeups.  Also passed this camera around to family members who are very discerning and they were impressed too.  I definitely encourage anyone to ignore (or take with a massive dose of salt) the negative reviews.

What a difference!  Seemingly unlimited battery and storage (I installed an 8gb card).  It's user friendly, in that there's help text available on it's very large display.  Plus, the auto picture taking capability really works - you don't have to select the proper mode - it does it for you.  It's focus and blurring reduction features haved smitten me.  Focus use to be my buggaboo - but no more.  All my pics are in focus now.  The only drawback is the display becomes dim in extremely bright light - such as you might find in the Salt Flats (think cloudless sky, and white reflective salt for miles around, and sun, and sun and sun).  But, the pics I took there this summer all came out well anyway - see for yourself - right here ... [...].  I love this little camera. I can depend on the battery always being ready. I can depend on it being ready to store more pictures.  And I can depend on it taking perfect shots.  You know, I tried taking shots out the side windows of moving cars - and it did that without blurring either.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent \"Grab It and Run\" Camera", "Author": "Thomas E.

Giving a camera like this to a child, any child, is just asking for trouble. My 21 year old daughter is hard on cameras. This camera wasn't manufactured to \"Military Specifications\" and will often break when dropped or otherwise mishandled. If you are using a memory card from another camera, you need to format it in your new camera, before trying to use it. You should also be aware that memory cards do fail. Don't buy the cheapest one you can find.I bought this little camera for my wife, who likes to take \"snapshots.\" It is very easy to use, takes very nice pictures (no, not as good as my Canon 50D, but what do you expect?), and is reasonably well built.

Yue \"Phenix\"", "ReviewID": "RN5V4P4GVAKIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all reviews before I bought this Kodak M380 directly from Kodak online store several weeks ago when its promotion price was $99.99 with a free Kodak 4GB memory card and free shipping. After two-week testing of using this camera, I think it's really a perfect camera at this price! Other people already mentioned its main features. However, I esp. like the following features:1. Compact, cute and very portable. I bought a 3.1 Mega Pixels Kodak DX4330 camera about 6 years ago, it takes very good pictures but bulky, although it still works without any problems and my wife still likes to use it because of it takes very colorful pictures.2. 5X Optical Zoom is wonderful for me to capture photos and videos for my daughter when she performs some shows on the stage.3. Its rechargeable battery lasts much much longer than rechargeable AA battery. During the past two weeks, I took more than 100 pictures (some with flash light) and about 20-minute video, the battery icon still shows 1/2 remaining power (I set LCD brightness to median, not high).4. Big LCD screen and very easy to browse all of the pictures on the camera.Some reviewers mentioned the soft \"Ka Ka\" sound during the operation. I am not very good in the optical field, however, I know this is not a problem at all because this is the sound made by the camera when it automatically adjust its focus on the object before its lens when you use Smart Capture mode and keep moving the camera. If you use other mode or record video, there will be no such \"Ka Ka\" sound. This is not a mechanical issue at all in my opinion.Overall, this is an excellent camera at this price. If you don't like it, of course, you can always spend several hundred dollars more to buy yourself whatever camera you like.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "great camera..", "Author": "Paul F.

It gives you some lee way to make choices, but if you don't have camera sense don't blame the camera.

If you got a shaky hand with x 5 Zoom,  don't be surprised if the result is blurred.. with any of these less exspensive cameras.

However, our experience with four of these cameras shows that they just don't hold up!  They last from as little as 2 months to possibly 2 years if you're lucky.  Durability isn't something you can assess at the store.We kept thinking it was something about us -- \"Maybe sand got into the lens\" or \"The plane flight was choppy\" --but we finally came to realize that these cameras are just poorly made.

So we stopped in at the first Walmart we saw and did some quick comparisons and made a purchase of the Kodak M380.  It had a good feature set, including 10 Mpixels and a 5x optical zoom.I took a few pictures with it to make sure it was OK and then put in a 4GB SD card.  When I then powered it up, it locked up and made a soft buzzing sound.  The only way I could get it working again was to pop out the battery and put it back in.  (I've used the SD card before, in another camera (the one left behind), so I know the SD card is OK.) I thought maybe this was a one-time glitch, so I kept the camera.  After half a day taking pictures in D.C., it happened again.  And then at night, when the card was almost full, the camera again stopped responding, this time with a slightly different lock-up.Even if it was the SD card, the camera should be able to protect itself against a bad card.

It takes great close up pictures outside or when the lighting is perfect , especially with that nice 5x zoom. I go inside to take pictures and the lighting is ok.  The subject turns out with a black background.  I try different modes, which don't help.  I love the idea of having the dial to get to your desired mode quickly.  The menu is awesome and easy to use.  But you need to take so many pictures to get one good one, and sometimes you don't get a good one. At night, sometimes the pics turn out too dark, and the flash went off or you were in the night mode.  I want a camera that takes great pictures on the first shot.  This is not that one.
