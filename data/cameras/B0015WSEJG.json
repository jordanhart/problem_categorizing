First of all I want to say that the picture featured here and Best Buy for L200 isn't correct. If you want to see the accurate picture then find L210 model and L200 looks exactly like that model. Only difference between the two model is L200 has Digital Image Stabilizer and L210 has Dual Stabilizer (both optical and digital).I was really surprised at how small this camera is. I know lot of people actually coomplains of the compactness of some digital cameras, now I see their reason for complaint. Because it really does feel like it might slip and fall. But I like compact/thin cameras so it was big plus for me.It comes with an AC adapter so you are not stuck with USB cable to recharge the camera through your computer. Also included in the package is A/V cable to view pictures or video directly through TV monitor.Manual that comes with the package isn't much help since it's just a quick reference with 10 other languages. So you need to download the manual through the CD-ROM and it is 102 page worth of info that needs to be digested before actually appreciating all the features this little camera comes with.  I took about 30 picture today and all of them look superb and I was twicking with different settings and modes.Best reason to get this camera is the price.Update: I have been using this camera for 15 days and I love all the quick scene modes and program mode. Auto mode does everything really well, too. One complaint I've is that it doesn't let you delete a shot during preview. For example, after you've taken a shot you can view it from 1-3 sec but you won't be able to delete the shot then rather have to go to picture view to delete. But I'm very satisfied with the quality pictures.Update 12/05/2008: Still satisfied and still 5-stars. I do have one suggestion though: I found that leaving the setting on AUTO mode or Scene Mode is the best option. Also, if one turns off the flash then there's no guarantee if the picture would look blurry or not. Unless one have surgeon precision hands or a tripod, then don't risk setting the flash off. There's DIS (digital image stabilizer) which is for low lighting condition without flash and the image isn't blurry but that takes few seconds to actually take the shot, so not a good option on the fly. But with auto flash on the pictures are of amazing quality.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great features on paper, horrible camera.", "Author": "Bill Stevenson", "ReviewID": "R3NZH4V8Z8D9W0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros:10.2 megapixels, relatively low noise, especially at higher ISOs compared to other consumer-grade digicams.Optical AND digital image stabilization.Very compact.Macro shots work well when light is plentiful.USB cable allows camera to act as high-speed mass media storage access, and charges the battery while it's connected to the PC.Good quality xvid-encoded video. You can zoom in and out while recording video, but the sound drops out. Also has an anti-shake feature while recording.Cons:The autofocus is the worst I've seen on any digicam in years. It usually takes 3-4 attempts before it's able to get a clear focus on anything. As long as you're taking pictures of trees it's fine, but good luck trying to snap something moving.  It also renders the ISO1600 setting relatively useless due to it's inability to focus on anything remotely dim, even when using the integrated autofocus lamp.The major flaw is the autoISO feature. Most cameras will pick the appropriate ISO given the amount of light present, right? This little beauty will also, but the catch is IT WILL ONLY USE ISOs UP TO 200. For the vast majority of point-and-click consumers, this translates to unusably blurry indoor shots unless you use the flash, which makes everything look washed out. The real pity is that the higher ISO modes (800 and 1600) are fantastic quality. It's a shame that Samsung allowed this oversight, and didn't include an auto400 and auto1600 mode.Also sorely missing is a \"last 3\" or \"last 5\" mode that many comparable models offer.Other Thoughts:I've attempted to contact Samsung multiple times regarding the ISO issue, but have yet to receive any response. Assuming their lack of response is indicative of their customer service, that could be considered another negative.I'm very mixed on the camera. On one hand, it boasts some very advanced technology for the price. On the other hand, I get the feeling that usability was not high on Samsung's agenda. There are dozens of useful features offered by competitors, yet instead of matching those features, Samsung chose to include bells and whistles like in-camera musical slideshows and post-processing.Even the camera strap is indicative of their simple oversights. Most camera straps have a little \"cinch-up\" band that keeps it from sliding off your wrist. This one doesn't have that, making the camera prone to slide off your wrist and kiss the pavement. I replaced mine with a wiimote strap.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great replacement camera", "Author": "Glenna Dockery", "ReviewID": "R31OE3QN635OWE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 3 year old son broke my sony digital camera while I had dozed off. His dad bought me this one after I had read several reviews and shopped around. Shipping was super fast and the price couldnt be beat. We have a 3 month old at home and didnt want to miss any photo ops. Takes great pics, but so far doesnt perform too well in low or no light (no night setting). Other than that I am very pleased. It takes faster pics than my Sony did and the accessories are cheaper. At the price I paid I wont be crushed if something happens to this one.

I initially gravitated to this camera because of the small size, wide display screen, 10.2 megapixel photos it promised (10.2 MP was very impressive at that time for a point & shoot), available SD card slot, and array of shooting modes offered by the camera. It all sounded very good. I had owned Samsung electronics before and had no problem...Well, there's a first time for everything.While this does have the capacity of delivering decent photographs, it takes A LOT of fooling around with the camera settings and a lot of luck in terms of lighting. We're talking 10 minutes taking multiple shots until you finally get one that's good. I agree with a previous reviewer: this camera takes some of the worst auto-focus shots I've ever seen. It takes multiple tries to get the camera to focus correctly and even then, the flash may not light the subject well and the photos will have a lot of noise and blur. If you can't even get decent shots in Auto mode, then things don't look good.Truth be told, out of all the modes available, I've had the best luck with Manual. I get better shots in Manual mode after tinkering with the settings than I ever do with Auto, but even then it's a crap-shoot.Also, the battery life on this thing is atrocious. I've used two different lithium ion batteries in this and every time I turn it on it will beep at me that the battery is low, even if I haven't used it in weeks.All in all, this thing is pretty awful. I wouldn't recommend anybody buy this if they're looking for a point & shoot that will deliver decent photos.

As said by others, any pictures of moving objects or in low light situations come out blurry.  Also on point with another reviewer as my camera also will freeze up when in \"review\" mode, making me have to take the battery out and put it back in to restart the unit.  Also find it hard to get close-ups on things, especially with writing.  My old Sony Cyber-Shot has none of these issues.The only thing that I think is any good about this thing is that it can fit in my pocket and that when the conditions are right, it does take good pictures.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst camera ever owned.", "Author": "Savy shopper", "ReviewID": "R1WQMOI2N4SGS7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst camera.

I contacted Samsung and was told to send it to their service location.I thought perhaps, they would find a setting that was inadvertently pushed, or somesuch, since the first few videos sounded great. Nooooooooo, they sent it back to me telling me it was working \"GREAT\".I took several more videos, which when put on several different computers, you could only hear if you turned the volume all the way up.  I contacted Samsung again, and was told to send it back in.  It's a little frustrating to pay $8 plus to keep sending this camera in when the fault is not mine.  I am choosing to keep it, and just not take any more important videos on it, that I actually want to HEAR.I truly think this is a problem with Samsung's SERVICE DEPARTMENT more than the camera itself.
