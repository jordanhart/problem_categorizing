Example, I have a Night Owl DVR so I should get Night Owl cameras. I believe that only a few compatible cameras will work with this but after about a year, I ve lost my night vision on one of these cameras. I would be replacing it with a Night Owl camera.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004FT4C3S"}}
