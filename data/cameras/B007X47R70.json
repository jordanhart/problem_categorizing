Many of the indoor photos look better without the flash than with it.Love the sports mode photography.  Went to a softball game and was able to catch the ball coming in, making contact with the bat and on the way out!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just fantastic!!!", "Author": "Robbie Godfrey", "ReviewID": "RV2XO03SRTHCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As each day passes I look forward more and more to getting out my D3200 and looking for something to shoot. I'm a novice and this camera bundle with its two lenses makes me want to capture more images and learn more about photography. It's just perfect and I love it. Now for that tripod and decent, mountable, vary-directional flash and I'll be all set!I will say, though, that the sun shade featured in the bundle pic is a bit pointless as a better one comes with the camera anyway - why not feature that one? But there is nothing i can think of that would detract from a five star rating. Decent price; the delivery was awesome; I called the distributor who gave excellent advice and previously I was a Canonite (and I still remain so, just that I'm now enjoying Nikon too) but the images .... Just fantastic!!!", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "James Z.", "ReviewID": "R3GKB7RNZ4MFYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does everything advertised and more, especially happy with action  sport shots.
