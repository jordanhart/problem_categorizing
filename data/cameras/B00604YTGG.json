{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Compared with GF1 and GH2", "Author": "Parka", "ReviewID": "R24PZQS078MO3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the GF1 and GH2 so I'll be comparing with those two cameras. I like the rangefinder-like body but as with using a camera, the photos and image quality comes above all. That's the reason why I use my GH2 more often than the GF1. But now with the GX1, it seems like Panasonic is finally able to put GH2 capability into a GF1 body. That's something I've been looking for.- BUILTThe GX1 construction is sturdy. It's a metal body and now comes with a new rubber grip that I like. You get a firmer hold when using heavier lens.The GX1 is slightly slimmer than GF1. At 272g, it's 13g lighter than GF1 and 120g lighter than GH2. By the way, the LVF2 is 36g.Buttons behind are rearranged a bit. I've read a few reviews saying the buttons are cheap and misaligned, but I don't think that's so with my set.The new flash can now be tilted back for a bounce lighting so that's useful. But the flash films filmsy. I seldom use it even with my GF1 so it's a small issue.The battery used here is the BMW-BLD10, also used by the GF2. That means now I have three different batteries and chargers with GF1, GX1, and GH2. I seriously think Panasonic should release new batteries only when they can double the capacity. 2 old batteries are always going to last longer than whatever new battery. Panasonic, just choose a slim battery and stick with it for 10 years.- SPEED (Autofocus and handling)I value speed A LOT.I'm glad to say that the autofocus speed is very comparable to GH2, which means it's almost instant.The touchscreen is convenient for autofocus. Choosing focus points is faster with one touch, compared to several button presses on the GF1.Everything seems breezy with the camera. Startup is fast. Moving through menus is fast. Writing to files is alright but that's dependent on the card speed. Class 10 is a good card speed. If you want really fast writing time, get a SanDisk Extreme Pro UHS-1 card.The improved speed makes it fantastic for street photography. See something interesting on the street. Power on, hold it to your eye, touch-focus and snap. It all happens very fast, as things on the street do.- IMAGE QUALITYThe 16mp sensor here is similar to the one on G3. The ISO performance has improved a lot. On the GF1, ISO 800 is my no-go zone. On GX1, I can go up to ISO 3200 and not be worried that noise becoming the subject of the photo. I think there's about 1-stop plus advantage.Image quality is great in most situation. Colours are pleasing but I still prefer Canon colours. Everyone sees colour differently. It's subtle and you have to compare photos side by side to see the difference. The colour temperature in the GX1 seems slightly cooler.White balance is still a problem with artificial light sometimes. WB intelligence still has some ways to go. It's a small issue that can be easily fixed in post process.Dynamic range has improved slightly I feel. Always shoot raw to get the best possible quality to tweak later if you so desire.Overall, the image quality seems comparable to the GH2.- VIDEO QUALITYAll Panasonic micro four thirds cameras have fantastic video quality out of the box. It gets better with good lens.What's improved here is it can record 1080/60i movies now. It's great for those who need it. I normally shoot 720p on my GF1 and GH2, so I'll still be shooting 720p here. I like the 720p for the smaller file size which is quicker to upload online.- CONCLUSIONI'll rate the camera 5 stars in its class. However, if I include DSLRs for comparison, GX1 would probably be 4 or 4.5 stars. Image quality very good but not stellar, mostly the part on colours. I've to emphasis again that colours is quite subjective, so maybe it's just me.It's a rather pricey camera (body only). And the new LVF2 goes for USD 299 at recommended retail price. So the total cost of camera and LVF2 can be higher than GH2 body!I've always wanted a GH2 quality in GF1 body (and weight). The maximum ISO I reach in most situations is ISO1600 and this camera is perfectly capable of handling that, so it's a big plus for me.The biggest reason to upgrade from GF1 would be for the improved ISO performance. If you've been missing shots because of photos being too noisy, it's a worthy upgrade.BUT BUT BUT...if it's just the ISO performance, I might recommend, to get your money's worth, consider a good low light lens to use with the GF1. You can get the Panasonic Leica 25mm lens and still have change left! And I've used the Olympus 12mm lens with GF1 at night, shooting at 1/10s on ISO 400, and gotten a relatively sharp photo.GH2 users have less reason to buy since image quality difference is not drastic. The more probable reason would be to get a lighter gear. It is 120g lighter. It's worth considering if you don't mind the missing viewfinder (available for a price). I see myself using the GX1 more because of the lighter weight. I don't shoot for critical events, and the GX1 can handle most of what I already do currently with the GH2. So if I start using the GH2 less, I'll be selling it away.Last note. If you check back to reviews on the GF1 when it was first released, you'll be able to see much of the criticism have been addressed.I still wish for that in-built EVF in the GF/X series but I don't think I'll see that from Panasonic in the near future. Well, a LVF2 is better than no alternatives.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "first m43 and very satisfied", "Author": "Wayne", "ReviewID": "R1B8LXLLXFOXGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A conversation with a friend on Sony's Nex 7 started my journey into a full week research on these new mirrorless compact interchangeable lens cameras.  My choices went from the Sony Nex 7, Samsung NX200, Olympus EP3, Olympus EPL3, Pentax Q, Fuji X100 (lens not interchangeable), Nikon J1 and the V1.I'm looking for a pocketable camera that can take good pictures.  I can sacrifice a few things if it means I'm more likely to carry the darn thing with me.  The m43 fits the bill with their smaller lens.  To counter the previous reviews, the build quality on the GX1 is excellent.  I purchased the camera from my local Samys where I got to hold and play with the Olympus, Nikon and Panasonic cameras.  From the bunch, the Panasonic felt the best.  It has enough weight to feel legitimate in the hands.  The hand grip is just right for this size of a camera.  The mode dial is firm and not likely to shift when maneuvering in and out of my jacket pocket.  It has customize-able dial settings C1 and C2 as common with the latest Panasonic cameras.  It has programmable soft keys (in the touch screen) within quick reach.  The menu system is nicely laid out and quick. The Q-menu, short for quick menu, is also customizable.  I arranged mines to give me instant access to various settings for raw, metering, etc.  This is a nifty feature and seen in other Panasonic cameras.  It's clear that Panasonic pays a lot of attention to this aspect of the usability experience.  You can pick it up and navigate through the menu very easily without a manual. Another cool feature is live manual focus mode.  In automatic focus mode, you can adjust the manual focus ring and the body will automatically switch to that mode while zooming into the focus area so you can set your focus.  Really cool for this body.  The touchscreen is very good and with the firmware update it's excellent.  Keep in mind these are your resistive type screens for usability reason as opposed to capacitive screens found in your cellphones.  This prevents you from accidentally pressing soft buttons on the screen as you manipulate the camera.The auto focus is extremely fast hooked up to a Panasonic 20mm in my test shots at alternating distances (from close to far).  Shot to shot is very quick but not as quick as quick as you would find in a full body dslr (as noticed when compared to my Pentax K20D), but still impresses my friends.  Now, there is a jog dial for aperature, shutter, and EV settings thats context sensitive.  In manual mode the dial operates aperature and a quick press will get it to shutter.  Likewise, in aperture mode, a press of the dial will allow you to instantly adjust EV. The dial feels great.  GX1 has a metal lens mount.  In fact, most of the body is metal which sets it apart from the G3.  It does have the touchscreen shutter release allowing you to snap away from just touching points on the screen to set the focus area just like the EP3.There's quite a bit of fanboyism between the Olympus and Panasonic sides of the m43 house.  The general feeling I get is Panasonic folks just happy with their gear with the Olympus side pressing the issue of what's a better system.  What's often overlooked from the point and shoot migrators as opposed to coming in from the dslr side is that \"you are buying into a system\".  Right now, Panasonic makes the better lens of both brands in image and physical quality of the lenses as noted by the price differences.  The Panasonic 20mm is considered a must have.  The 7-14mm, 45mm and others are among the best lenses.  What's overlooked in comparisons is that you will not get the in body chromatic abberation corrections using an olympus body with a panasonic lens.  The lens you will keep for a long time while you upgrade your bodies in the years to come.  If you're using a wide range of older tele lens WITHOUT a tripod you might do better with an Olympus, but I'm not sure there are many people hand holding a camera with a tele lens.  On the other hand, the Panasonic's sensor is a stop or two faster due to the new sensor which gives it some shake resistance.Then there's the question of picking the gx1 or g3.  The G3 is a great camera and you should definitely consider it.  It's feature packed with an evf and a full flip out screen (as opposed to simply articulating). Specs of these two side by side are available online.  There's a few differences in performance and obviously build quality as the gx1 is mostly metal.  If you're doing a lot of video then the gh2, and sony nex series are your candidates.  The quality of the gh2 videos are already well noted and has been compared with the canon 5d mark II, especially with some hacked firmware.Coming from the K20D and did my share of research for several weeks before purchasing this camera.  As a result I went through several reviews, blogs and forums.  You maybe in the same boat comparing the Olympus EP3 and the GX1 and you really ought to hold onto both cameras to see what feels right for you.  I want to address a peculiar review on stevehuffs blog where he puts these cameras head to head in natural mode with no adjustment to compare jpgs (as Olympus is noted for their jpeg processor).  A more useful review would have been to take both cameras and adjust the settings for what seems optimally pleasing to the reviewer.  Otherwise, what's the point of having settings?  This is akin to taking a hdtv out of the box and watching it as is compared to calibrating it, even if by eyeball.  A little rant on how uninformative some of the review sites maybe.In regards to the lack of an electronic view finder.  You can purchase this separately if you need it so the issue is added cost.  Just factor it in and consider it the ability for you to decrease the form factor without it.  A non issue for some and others not so.Also, there's a new firmware out and you should definitely upgrade.  The Auto White Balance is much improved for indoor shots.  I love the gx1.  It's beautiful and you can't go wrong with either colors (satin, black).  When I play with the gx1 after playing with my dslr the gx1 feels just fantastic to hold.In the next year or so, I hope to see gorilla glass used by all camera makers for their dslrs and compacts to prevent scratching and damage.  Another note, keep an eye on the Samsung compacts.  The NX200 is a thing of beauty from the pictures and the system sports a good selection of lenses.  I just didn't get the chance to handle one.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not quite a Contax G2, but an excellent camera", "Author": "S. Kasapi", "ReviewID": "R1IUC8QKGKBG1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally don't post reviews, but I've been surprised at how few reviews of this camera there are on Amazon. Some of the negative reviews have also been a bit bizarre, IMHO, so I wanted to share my opinion with other photo enthusiasts. Specifically, I'm writing to people who loved (or still love) the discontinued Contax G2.My gold standard for a mirrorless (ie. rangefinder) camera is the Contax G2, which is a film camera. It stopped production when Contax died some time ago, but it still has a cult-like following. Some called it the poor man's Leica, but it's really an excellent camera. The mechanics were mostly very solid (the viewfinder housing was flimsy), the focus was confident and fast, and it had a suite of outstanding lenses. It was easy to hold, durable, and very pretty. I took a lot of photos with my G2 that I'm very fold of. Then I sold it because I got tired of scanning film.I've been hoping someone would come up with a digital camera like the G2. Maybe Leica has, but I could never justify spending thousands of dollars for a basic body. Forget about the prices of Leica lenses...  To give you context, I've been using a Nikon D700 with primarily the 24-70 f2.8 (excellent image machine but big - too big a lot of the time), the Panasonic LX5 (a great camera, small and very capable, but a far cry from the G2 when it comes to handling and image quality), and my iPhone (the iPhone 4S is pretty good if you don't force it to embarrass itself).Panasonic's GF1 seemed like a nice camera, but I never was terribly impressed by the images I saw from it. As my lawyer used to say, nice try but no cigar. The GF2 and GF3 are fine cameras, I'm sure, but they weren't heading in the direction of the G2, so I passed.I ordered the GX1 on a whim, prepared to return it if I didn't get much use out of it. After using the GX1 for 4 weeks, I've decided to keep it. It's the closest I've come to the G2 at a reasonable cost. The body is well-balanced, easy to hold, and pretty. The controls are familiar, probably because I'm used to the LX5. It's very responsive and well-built. I've mostly been using the 20mm f1.7 and the 14-45mm Panasonic lenses. It's hard to compare to images from the G2 because there are so many ways to manipulate images in post-processing, but with practice I'm pretty sure the GX1 isn't going to limit me any more than the G2 did.Two things I think should be made clear:1) If you like rangefinders, you should get the add-on viewfinder. Just consider it part of the base cost of the camera.2) There's no dedicated focus button. The only way to initiate focus, as far as I can tell, is with the shutter release. That's a problem if you prefer to fix focus on auto as I do. You can manually focus, of course, but that's a pain.Be aware of these two issues.I'm not able to compare the GX1 to the plethora of other MILC cameras out there since I haven't tried them to the same extent. Having spent some quality time with the GX1, though, I think this camera is a good platform. I'll be sticking with it for a few years. There's a cost in time and energy learning a new platform, so I don't relish switching.As I said, I don't normally write reviews, but I think there's a small group like me that just wants a small, pleasant, reliable photographic platform to build on.I think the GX1 is that platform for those of us who miss the G2.For Fellini fans, it's 8-1/2 of the G2 :-)", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - With caveats", "Author": "A. Hasija", "ReviewID": "R2LSW87OV1FV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera - with some caveats.I got into photography about a year ago. My last camera was also a micro four thirds camera and I invested a lot of money into the platform( read lenses) since I loved the small size and portability of the format. As most readers know the Micro Four Thirds(MFT) format has a crop factor of 2, which means, that the area of the sensor is \u00bd the size of a full format camera. This also means that a 20 mm lens will show the same size of picture as a 40mm lens on a full format sensor.With that out of the way, let's look at some pros of this camera:1. Small size, light weight: I do a lot of street photography. Having a big DSLR makes me stand out immediately and puts people on the defensive. The small size of this camera does make it very discreet and less obtrusive.2. Lightning fast focus: seriously, lightning fast.3. Availability of lenses: The MFT format supports pretty much all mounts for lenses using adapters. In the last year I have collected some great old glass ranging from Leica to Olympus OM to Kodak Cmount lenses. This format is a great way to shoot with premium glass like Leica on a budget. No need to spend almost $6K on an M9 body, you can shoot digitally for much less.4. Upgraded internals: The sensor density has been increased by 33 percent to 16 megapixels from 12 megapixels of the older MFT cameras. This is not necessarily a great thing, but it does let you capture more detail. Also the JPG engine has been improved, though some might say that Olympus does a better job in rendering JPGs. I mostly shoot in raw so that does not really pertain to me.5. Touch screen : This will be a boon to most newer photogs who are upgrading from a basic point and shoot. The touchscreen on the back of the camera allows you to select a focusing point and take a picture by just touching the screen. This does mitigate the apprehension that most users that are inclined to upgrade from a P&S.;6. Great low light performance: Speaking from personal experience here, I have found this camera to be 10 times better in low light  performance. I have taken pictures at 1600 iso with minimal noise, whereas I was limited to 400 iso on my E-P1 before noise became an issue.7. Built in flash: The flash is cool, the best part about it is that it can be used as a bounce flash (though with limited range) in an indoor environment. This was a major selling point for me, as my old E-P1 did not have a flash, and I was stymied in my ability to take pictures in dimly lit interiors.8. 4 FPS burst mode: Not great, but definitely an improvement over other MFT cameras.9. Highly customizable menus: you can set up menus to display your favorite settings.Some things that irked me about this camera:1. Touchscreen: The touchscreen is only 420K dots - which is subpar. It really is difficult to see in really bright situations. I bought the live viewfinder to mitigate this, but the viewfinder+body+lens ends up costing more than thePanasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-140mm HD Hybrid Lens (Black), which already has a built in viewfinder. Also, you cannot use the olderPanasonic DMW-LVF1 External Live Viewfinder for Panasonic GF1 Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera viewfinder, as it is not compatible with the GX1. So you have to get the Panasonic DMW-LVF2 External Electronic Viewfinder which is new, and costs over $200. I will recommend purchasing this with the camera, especially if you do a lot of daytime photography, or want a more stable way of holding the camera than at an arm's length.2. Image stabilization: The inbuilt image stabilization in the E-P1 spoilt me. It was very forgiving. In order to get perfectly crisp pictures with this camera, you have to have perfect technique. It is not necessarily a deal breaker, as I feel it will force me to get better.3. The power X lens: I played with one at a local dealer, and decided against getting it. Not sharp enough, too much CA. That's why I decided to just get the body.4. Power hungry: needed to get an extra battery for extended shooting sessions.5. Lowest ISO is only 160: 100 would have been better.With all that being said - I highly recommend the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras lens. That combo really makes this camera shine as a street photography camera. Fast to focus, fast to take pictures - makes sure you don't miss anything. The menu's are pretty intuitive too - I had never had a Panasonic camera and it took me about 10 minutes of fiddling around to come to grips with most settings.Overall, I give this camera a solid 4.5 out 5.Now buy this, and go out and shoot.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, when it works. Terrible terrible customer service", "Author": "Dani J. Page \"Dani J Page\"", "ReviewID": "R27QUDY0TXKTFH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I should get a few things in the open first:I haven't actually gotten to play with the RAW images yet. There's still no RAW codec for OSX yet. I don't know who's fault that is. I do know that the included software is rather pathetic and slow. As in, 10 hours to convert 200 pictures. Something is seriously wrong there.The JPEGS I've played with all look pretty amazing. Given how sensitive the sensor is it's pretty nice.The video looks great too, although very limited in control.The build quality is really nice. It's solid feeling etc. I think almost every review will say the same thing.The way the EVF works is nice, although that's a whole other product.The bad:Customer service is terrible. I mean absolutely terrible. I had used the GX1 around town for a month and gotten used to the way it works. I got it so I could carry it in my messenger bag alongside my laptop or iPad. I'm a professional camera operator so I have lots of fun gear, but none is anywhere near the compact sized of the GX1. I even used it on sets to do BTS work. It's so small I can carry it with me while I work.So what happened? While on vacation I decided to only take the GX1. I got it for this reason. Bad idea. Camera died 1st day into the vacation. Simply would not turn back on or anything. It flashed the screen green and then froze. Removed the battery and wouldn't turn on anymore. So a weeks vacation with no pictures.When I got back I tried sending the camera in. I was informed via email to mail it to a Texas facility but I needed to fill out an online form first. When I did, it said since I was in Florida it couldn't help me and I needed to call. Calling gave me to an automated system that isn't an straight forward as Panasonic thinks it is. When I finally got to fill out a claim, it informed me I needed to send it to Ga instead. So I did.A week later I get the camera back thinking \"that was fast\" but instead I'm greeted with \"This item is not repaired at this facility.\" Go Panasonic. Thanks for wasting $15 so I could send it to the facility you told me to.So a call back today. First issue: couldn't get ahold of a real person. It took me 20 minutes to do just that. When I did, no one seemed to know what a GX1 was. Yeah . . . . can we say third world call center? It's bad enough to play with automated systems, but to deal with someone who is underpaid and doesn't have the faintest idea what I'm talking about is unbearable. If they knew what I was talking about, I could forgive the foreign call center. But all they're doing is typing away at the keyboard and doing nothing to help.Now once again I get to pay $15 bucks to mail it off to what I now hope it the right repair center. Maybe they'll know what this camera is?As far as the camera itself, I'd give it 5 stars if I could use the RAW files right now. It's only been 3 months . . . As far as customer service goes, I won't be buying anything from Panasonic again.Update:I can finally edit the RAW files. Wahoo! As I've stated, for such a small camera the pictures are great. I don't pixel peep as I'm not a technician. I am a photographer. This isn't a 5Dm2 or similar camera, but it's highly portable. The images had really good latitude, handled being processed well and overall held up in post.The bad, yet again. It's been over a month now and Panasonic still hasn't gotten my camera back to me. I get calls once a week informing me they are waiting on a part. When I contacted Panasonic demanding either a replacement or refund, all I get is a \"we don't handle that, call this\" blah blah blah. I've already had to use a different camera because of this issue. When, and if, I get it back I'm more than likely selling the camera.I should also note I had a talk with the repair center. They fixed the issue I sent it in for within the first week. The problem was THEY broke something else and couldn't get the part in until I called and had to threaten to call a lawyer.Another update May 13th.So Panasonic finally shipped me the camera back. Yes, after 3 months I finally get the camera back. Only they don't tell me they're shipping the camera. I had a week long gig out of town doing what I do, video and film production. So I'm out of town for a whole week and how I do I find out Panasonic shipped my camera? I get a customer satisfaction survey. Yeah . . . I finally got home tonight and see all the UPS delivery attempts and the final notice saying they're shipping back. A quick call to UPS confirms it's already halfway back to MacAllen. We'll see how they decide to continue from here.May 29th.The camera FINALLY has made it's way back to me. After calling to complain after I knew they had received the camera back the promised to ship the camera out. They refused to give me any confirmation or tracking number. A week later I get a call asking to confirm my shipping address as the last attempt wasn't received. Let's just say the lady wasn't happy with my response. All in all, I have my camera back. It originally malfunctioned on Feb 13th and was promptly sent in for repair. I received it back on May 29th.I will state that normally I would not rate a product based on the service of a seller. However, this is not a seller. This is Panasonic. Part of any product these days is the warranty and the service that goes along with it. Any warranty is built into the price of the product you buy and thus you are paying for it.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good upgrade to the GF1", "Author": "Abe \"Photo Dude\"", "ReviewID": "R21K7HAUM4628B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the GX1 reluctantly because my GF1 is a very good camera and I was concerned that the improvement would be so minor that I would have wasted my money. It turns out my concerns were unfounded. The GX1 is a major improvement both in terms of image quality, particularly at higher ISOs, and usability, specifically the touch screen. The additional pixels are useful, but not as relevant as the overall improvement in image quality. Images shot at ISO 800 and 1600 are quite good with the GX1, whereas the GF1 began to seriously degrade at these ISOs. I'm a fan of selective focus and being able to set the focus area by simply touching the live image on the screen is truly helpful. With the GX1's predecessor, using the buttons to set the focus area often took so much time that the \"moment\" was long lost. Overall, this is a fine camera and a major improvement over the GF1.Note that I have high expectations of a camera. I've owned nothing but high-end professional cameras for the past decade, including the Nikon D1X, D2X and my current 24-megapixel D3X. But I find myself using the GX1 more than 50% of the time, now.

Tired of carrying a heavy DSLR around, I was intrigued by the promise of micro four thirds. And the Panasonic GX1 attracted me most of all: small, stylish, with great functionality and build quality. Especially when combined with the new X lenses, it seemed like the perfect tiny package.Reality has turned out a bit different, and I'd like to cover some things in this review that haven't seen covered in much detail in other reviews.But first the good news: The Panasonic GX1 is very small and lightweight, and so are most of the lenses you can buy for it. Image quality is excellent, if not quite up to the same standard as the 1.5x format sensors available from Sony, Nikon and others. The build quality is quite good, and the usability is very good. Panasonic has done a great job with the touch-screen interface. The autofocus is fast and extremely accurate, much more accurate than any DSLR.There are of course some drawbacks. The 16MP panasonic sensor has great resolution, but the high-ISO performance is not quite up to par with the best 1.5x format sensors, even when considering the smaller crop factor. The auto-focus is not very good at tracking moving subjects. And the framerate is only 4 FPS, so this is not a great camera for shooting action, if that is your thing. Also, Panasonic does not offer in-body image stabilization, unlike similar camera bodies from Olympus. Battery life is poor. The battery on my Nikon D7000 is not much bigger, and I can take thousands of shots with it, compared to a few hundred with the Panasonic.The build quality of the GX1 is quite good, but not quite as good as I expected. There is no weather proofing. And the buttons are a bit flimsy. But in particular I was disappointed by the thumbwheel. This is one of the most important controls on this camera, and the thumbwheel is tiny and hard to operate. You also have to push it in like a button to access certain controls, and I found this to be cumbersome. I'm used to the nice front/rear wheels on my Nikon DSLR, and in comparison the thumbwheel on the GX1 is sorely lacking. I also wish the ISO was easier to change, and that Panasonic offered more customizable function buttons.Now to the things that surprised me about this camera and that I wish I knew before I bought it:- The shutter is loud and clunky, causing lots of vibration. This vibration may result in camera shake if the shutter speed is within the range of 1/60s - 1/320s or so. The result is a blurry photo, ranging from slight to severe, dependending on the lens, focal length and other factors. The 14-42 X lens that I had was very bad in this regard, especially at the long end. This vibration also affects the optical image stabilizer (OIS), resulting in photos that are less sharp than photos taken with the OIS off! After doing quite a bit of research on this matter, this seems to be a common problem, affecting not just the 14-42 X lens but other lenses as well, to a lesser extent. You are actually better off turning the OIS off at around 1/160s or so, except this can be quite cumbersome to do, especially on the new X lenses that don't offer an on/off switch on the lens barrel.- The shutter is loud. I know I just mentioned that, but I want to emphasize this. It's louder than some DLSRs, mirror slap and all. Forget about stealthy shooting with this camera. A Leica rangefinder it is not.- There is no way to reduce the shutter vibration by introducing a delay, locking the shutter beforhand, etc, like you have on some DLSRs. So even when the camera is set on a tripod, the shutter slap is going to affect your picture.- The 2x crop factor means lenses start becoming diffraction-limited at f/5.6. The good news is the lenses for this camera tend to be quite good wide open. But if you have your standard f/4-f/5.6 zoom, this means you don't have to stop down much before you start losing image quality. Past f/11 things start to get really bad, so the usable aperture range becomes quite limited. And not many fast lenses are available (especially zooms). The flip side of this is you get good depth of field even at large apertures, and can use a larger aperture (and faster shutter speed) than you would on a DSLR. On the other hand, selective focus and shallow depth of field is harder to achieve.- Panasonic will auto-correct photos for distortion and chromatic aberations (CA), even in RAW files! Not necessarily a bad thing, but good to know. It also means the optical quality of Panasonic's lenses isn't quite what it seems, especially when you compare them to other brands that don't automatically correct for the same lens defects!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "GX-traordinary!", "Author": "Andrew D. Lossing \"Go real.\"", "ReviewID": "R1ENM0KL3DQBGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How should I describe the Lumix GX1? Besides 'THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DEALS YOU WILL EVER FIND, BUY IT!'?I'll resist the urge to start with mirrorless cameras - if you're not familiar with what they are, do some research with a search engine - or a rundown of the Micro Four Thirds system. Suffice it to say that of the many good, recent mirrorless systems (they have become a trend with camera manufacturers in the past few years), M4/3 has a distinct advantage in body and lens choices, with some of the coolest lenses imaginable, readily available, although often outside of the dabbler's (read: me) price range. Any of myriad cameras by Panasonic and Olympus work with the array of lenses produced by the aforementioned brands, along with Leica(/Panasonic), Voigtlander and others, since M4/3 is an open standard, not a proprietary system like Nikon's, Canon's, et al.On to the GX1. Panasonic has a robust series of cameras available in this system, although in the classic, rangefinder style Olympus has a higher mind- and market-share. Olympus does also have its share of diehard fans, who will say things like \"Olympus jpg files are better\" and \"Olympus in-body image stabilization is best,\" but the truth is that both brands are extremely good. Panasonic has a bent towards video performance that Olympus does not; Olympus makes shinier, more eye-catching cameras. But you shouldn't let brand choices rule the day with this open standard system. Focus on the model you are drawn to, with the features you need.The GX1 represents the highest fit and finish (and feature-set) Panasonic has made within this small, rangefinder format. It's a sort of leap from the GF series of lighter-featured compact cameras with a lot of the features of the more DSLR-shaped and enthusiast-aimed G and GH cameras. I've owned a GF3, which is a bit smaller, but the difference is in build quality: the GF3 is mostly metal, and decently put together, but feels like a consumer camera. the GX1 feels like an instant classic, don't-make-'em-like-this-any-more, tough, beautiful workhorse of a camera, with solid metal body, nice rubber grip, and perfect finish all around.I feel like this camera bridges the gap between small size and ergonomic handling perfectly. The grip is big enough for my hand, but still compact, and even with a 3\" LCD there are just the right amount of buttons for a hardcore enthusiast user. There are two programmable buttons, a dual-purpose wheel (click in to switch between which setting you're adjusting: brilliant), a nice four-way, and all are metal and finished perfectly. The touchscreen works well, although it is resistive, not capacitive, so you need to made your presses known or it will ignore you. This is so that you don't constantly mess up the camera when using it as your hand brushes against the screen.The sensor is not the 12mp one used in the GF line, but a much nicer 16mp one that has much improved high-ISO performance against the GF3. I'm impressed with the ISO 1600 images I get, I remember when ISO 400 on a DSLR looked worse. Yes, the sensor is a bit aged now, and this kind of tech does move fast. However, for practical intents and purposes, the images it produces are excellent. I especially like the saturation and color rendition I've been getting with jpg files.Which brings me to my last point: obsolescence. Panasonic and Olympus iterate on their Micro Four Thirds cameras constantly, and they don't exactly hold their value a couple of years in. The list price for the GX1 is $700 body only; you're seeing it for around $250. It's not that old of a camera, and certainly holds up well. But the fact remains that Panasonic has already replaced the GF3 with the GF5 and is now releasing the GF6... and this great model is also being replaced by the upcoming GX7 (by early accounts a huge update and a fine camera). So why should you look at the GX1? Because there is more to photography than the latest sensor, more to it than best-in-class noise performance or image stabilization. Cameras are tools, the user is the one who makes the photo. But you need a good tool, one you can grow with, one that is rugged, well-designed and does what you need it to when you need it to do it. And which simply makes you happy to use it. The GX1 is all that. The single most compelling reason to own it is the desire to make great photos with a great tool. Panasonic's fast iteration means that I could own such a tool for around $250, which is just astounding. This camera still feels like a $700 camera, still acts like a $700 camera, but brings it within the reach of just about everyone who is prepared to spend even enough for a decent point-and-shoot.That's why the GX1 is so worth it. I use the 14mm f2.5 pancake lens, which is small and a great performer. There are many other lens options. The possibilities, as they say, are endless.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tiny, rugged, good lookin' & takes great pictures!", "Author": "P.K. Frary \"Gochugogi\"", "ReviewID": "R18ZL5KS3S7RIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The GX1 is tiny. Not skinny jean pocket wee but, with 14mm F2.5 pancake mounted, it easily slides in a coat pocket or purse. It's at its best with small lenses but handles telezooms if you support the lens barrel. The metal body shell (magnesium?) feels solid. A contoured and rubberized grip makes holding secure, but wish it had room for two more fingers. The textured matte black finish is impeccable. The design is not vintage inspired like a Pen, but is more modern and reminiscent of Contax. I was pleased to see \"Made in Japan\" on the bottom.CONTROLS: The GX1 is packed with advanced features but DSLR users should find controls intuitive. Major functions (ISO, WB, AF, etc.) have a dedicated button or dial and are labeled. Point 'n shoot converts will need to study the manual, but can start straightaway in auto mode. The buttons are small but I adjusted quickly. The single input dial/wheel, albeit tiny, falls naturally under the thumb. It's stiff and not likely to suffer inadvertent turning. The mode dial is knurled metal with firm click stops. There's a sturdy on-off flip lever on the top deck.If you're used to a tabbed interface with options visible on a single screen, e.g., like Canon, these menus will feel disorganized. There is rough subject organization via 5 icons, but requires scrolling through as many as seven screens of illogically grouped options. Fortunately, after set up, most people will rarely visit the menus as important features have physical controls.DISPLAY: The LCD is okay but falls short compared to current technology: resolution, refresh rate and brightness are lower than the LCDs on my E-P3, 7D and 5D MKII. The OLED of the E-P3 whips it silly. The slow refresh rate is bothersome: pans are smeared and jerky in low light. In fairness, nobody buys this camera for sports but a faster refresh rate would be welcome for panning rug rats 'n house critters.You have a choice of touchscreen or buttons/dial for most features. Touchscreen implementation is clumsy compared to an iPhone or Olympus E-P3. I prefer buttons and dials so I can operate by feel, so no biggie. If your first camera was an iPhone, the responsive touchscreen of a recent Olympus M4/3 model will suit you better. Finally, the LCD can't be turned off for time-lapse photography or use with optical viewfinders. You must buy the DMW-LVF2 to gain a LCD off switch.VIEWFINDER: The GX1 lacks a viewfinder but I purchased the optional Panasonic DMW-LVF2 External Live View Finder at Amazon for $160. It's pricey but you get a tilting EVF with LCD graphics. Using the DMW-LVF2 is the only way to shoot with the main LCD off. No eye-detect but is has a toggle button to deactivate the LCD. Viewfinders are essential for shooting in bright sunlight, for stealth in dark venues and the 90 degree tilt makes ground level shooting a snap. It also allows steadying the camera against the face, resulting in sharper images.SHOOTING: This is my point 'n shoot so portability is paramount. I mounted a Panasonic 14mm f/2.5 pancake lens and the package is so small and light I barely notice it has a lens. Single shot AF is fast and surefooted, even in dim light. AI servo tracking is weak but no buys this camera for sports. Exposures were normally accurate but night scenes tended towards overexposure, but it's easy to dial down with exposure compensation.Images are sharp and richly nuanced when viewed on my 27\" Cinema Display. I shoot RAW and \"develop\" in Apple Aperture. Image quality trails my 60D but is nipping at its coattails. The GX1 bests my E-P3 with 23% more resolution but noise levels are similar up to ISO 3200. I wouldn't hesitate using ISO 800 and ISO 1600 is surprising clean if you don't underexpose and apply noise reduction for skies and shadows. The GX1 yields 3 more stops of high ISO, extending to 12800, but beyond ISO 1600 is too noisy save for \"emergencies.\"Battery performance is weak and trails far behind my E-P3, 5D MK II and 7D, so carry a spare for a day of heavy shooting. Two hundred pics and your'e done. Using the DMW-LVF2, instead of the main LCD, doesn't save much battery power.FLASH: I mainly use natural light and employ the popup for fill-in flash. Slow sync mode blends flash and background light for a natural look. Unfortunately, slow sync tumbles in really dim light, e.g., a dark bar, and requires both flash and exposure compensation. Oddly, flash compensation was the only feature lacking obvious controls and I had to look it up in the manual: press a function button and turn the input dial.TRIPOD MOUNT: The tripod socket is centered under the lens but most quick release plates block the battery door. A small Arca plate with offset screw will clear the door. The Kirk PZ-130 fits fine and has an anti-twist lip.MIA: Lumix cameras--save for the GX7--lack in-body stabilization. Instead, stabilization is built into lenses. Well, some lenses: Lumix prime lenses lack stabilization but zooms have it. I knew the GX1 lacked in-body stabilization but bought it anyway. So I use a table top tripod or brace against walls and fences in dim light.LAST BLURB: Despite some grumbling, I like this camera. The positives of confident AF, near-DSLR image quality, stylish design, excellent fit and finish, petite size and useful features out weigh nitpicks. If this camera cost $600 I'd subtract a star or two for the zits.

But I do want to comment on the disparaging remarks regarding build quality. It's great for the price point. This is not a pro-level camera, one cannot expect Leica or full-frame pro-DSLR like build quality. For what you get, it is excellent. Everything feels sturdy and well put together. Thumb wheel feels solid. Don't really care for an articulating screen either, would just add to the bulk. The flash is a very interesting design since you can position it for a bounce. I seldom if ever use flash photography anyway, look at the size, it's puny. Besides I wouldn't hesitate to use ISO 3200. That in combination with a large aperture lens makes for an excellent low-light kit.Other things I'm really liking:- size, loving how small it is and the quality of images it can produce- touch screen, great for setting focus point (little slider is a very nice touch too, but why can't I customize it?)- lots of button customization- in general pretty intuitive to use- videos, getting some amazing resultsNot liking:- Price of EVF.

I absolutely love this camera. Purchased just the body only and Panny's 20mm f1.7 lens, they're excellent together. Full disclosure, I'm moving up from a P&S; camera...but I am familiar with the features such as aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings through general use, reading photo books and my old h/s photography class years ago. :)Pros- The build. It'll be the 1st thing you notice when you take the camera out of the box...and it's built like a tank (not literally, but it's sturdy). Very solid, premium built to it. The battery cover/door concerned me initially (just seems/feels flimsy) but no issues since purchase and I don't believe it will be.- The customization. On the mode dial there are 2 custom options, along with assigning quick access features to any of the 'fn' buttons. There are 2 on the body (back of the camera) itself and 2 more within the touch screen menu with a section that pulls out from the right hand portion of the screen. I've primarily been using the Aperture priority dial, but the ability to quickly access a preferred camera setup via the Custom mode dial is a nice feature.- The flash. We've all taken a picture with flash and we get that bright face with the unwanted shadow from the subject in the background. I find it brilliant that Panasonic incorporated a tilting feature to the flash. Haven't needed to use the flash due to it's strong low light capabilities, but I have tested it. A gem. Simply tilt towards the ceiling and it softly lights the subject without over exposing and no unwanted picture ruining shadows in the background.- The touch screen. This may be a personal preference, but it's not too bright. I tested the Olympus PEN E-P3 at a local camera shop and felt the OLED screen was way too bright...and if you plan on being outside in the sun, you'll more than likely get glare from the screen. With the GX-1, it really hasn't been an issue with me. I do wish there was a built in EVF, but thus far the live-view screen hasn't been an issue for me and will save me from having to purchase one.- New 16MP sensor. And it captures images beautifully. I know that for some advanced photobugs it's nothing new...but coming from a point & shoot...Wow. And the images I get from the 20mm lens as well. AMAZING! (look no further than the reviews from amazon on the 20mm lens) It really gives the image some 'pop' and depth of field. The bokeh (blurred background) is rendered nicely as well.- The grip on the front of the camera and thumb rest behind the camera. Very useful. Especially if you have large hands.- The iAuto button. My wife is not camera savy, but I'm definitely comfortable with handing it over to her and taking some shots with the iAuto feature turned on...especially if we're on vacation in the future. The button lights up a bright blue, so there is no mistake in telling you that it's on.- Video features. Great 1080 quality with no jello effect. What's even better is that you can switch from AVCHD to MP4 format. MP4 compresses (I believe) the video file better and it's been a breeze to upload videos to our Mac and email. Haven't used it much and don't believe I will, but if the situation comes up I know I have good working camcorder on hand. I'd def make sure to turn OFF continuous AF within the video camera menu. It's defaulted to ON and with my lens, it's constantly auto focusing and you can hear the motor in the video...and it gets annoying.- The Panasonic family of lenses. There's a lot to choose from.- RAW format. Renders the image just like my eyes see it. The colors are wonderful and true.- Too many more to list.Cons- JPEG. My biggest con. (Well, I soon able to fix one of them) A lot sites knocked on the GX-1 for its JPEG processing. Images are great, clear...no issues. It's just the color rendering leaves much to be desired. BUT! It can be fixed. The iResolution and iDynamic within the camera is defaulted to OFF...go within the the menu and put them both on 'Standard'...huge difference. The JPEG defaults (in my opinion) renders the image a little too dark, muted and flat...especially if there is shadows. Turn them both to 'Standard' and your set. Colors come our richer (in my opinion) and looks like what your eye sees. Granted that was resolved, but in JPEG pics...when indoors, for whatever reasons, it gives a little bit of a brownish cast. It's not always, but when testing indoors the lighting had an ever so slight brownish glow to it. And yet if I took another picture, it would go away. Not sure if it's a white balance or metering issue...just be on the lookout for it.- The camera is small. Took a little getting used to, but I prefer it much more over a bulky Canon or Nikon. If not for the large grip and thumb rest, I'd have shipped it back that same day.- Touch screen. Again, this may be personal preference yet to me, the touch screen is not sensitive enough. Initally you feel as though you have to give the screen a slightly firm press/touch. Not to the point of breaking it obviously, but if you're a touchscreen phone user, you'll definitely notice the difference between the camera's touchscreen and your phone. Granted after a while, you'll get used to it.Really can't think of too much else and don't want to be too techincal.

I got the GX1 and the 20mm lens for about the same price as the Oly. Though to be truthful, if the Oly had included the EVF, I might have gone in that direction.One caveat: I did not push this camera in the way I would push a DSLR. Physics are physics. Maybe some day they'll figure out how to hold down noise on a small sensor at high ISOs but that's for the future.

So far the camera meets my expectations and many areas it exceeds. I have been looking for a camera that performs close to Leica M7 & 35mm Leica lens combo in picture quality, portability, build quality, and available lens choice. I also have a LX5 which is a very good camera. GX1 is very similar to LX5 in many respects such as overall body size, buttons layout, picture quality, and menu system. In fact, GX1 looks like a big brother of LX5.Here's what I have found out so far.1. Overall build quality is excellent. The wheel button, battery cover, and connection port cover can be a little beefier but not that bad.2. Picture quality is quite good although I've seen more detailed shots from my Canon 1DS Mark2 with 35mm f1.4 lens combo. But this is not a surprise to me considering the sensor size and price  differences.3. The overall size and weight are just perfect for me. This is one aspect that I like GX1 combo better than Leica combo although Leica was lighter than most 35mm Pro SLRs at the time.4. Ergonomics is excellent. The camera feels very comfortable in my hand. FYI-my hand is a little bit on the smaller size.5. The built-in flash is not powerful at all but you can still use it for very near subject and use it as a master for slave flash set up.6. Metz flash works quite good with GX1 although looks strange because the flash is almost two times the size of the camera. A funny thing I noticed on GX1 is that the mode button is higher than the accessory shoe so my flash knurled knob interferes with the mode button. I rectified the problem by adding a thin nylon washer on the flash. FYI - Metz flash has an extra large diameter locking knob where most don't.7. The menu layout is very similar to LX5 so I am familiar with it. It's very simple and straight forward.8. Battery life is okay. I haven't tested it properly but seems lasting long enough.

When paired with a high speed lens, there's little between you and taking a low-light, well balanced photo.My brother and I swapped between his Olympus OM-D em-5, and swapped the lenses between the two bodies.  For being essentially 1/3 of the price of the OM-D, he was impressed with it, mostly with it's controls and \"click wheel\" which can easily jump between shutter speed and lens aperture.  The on-screen metering and (what he called) \"cheater bars\" which tell you when you're in a good range of the aperture and shutter speed settings, along with the light meter, makes taking a photo very expedient.Another great feature of the GX1 is it's \"auto\" mode (Auto Ai or something?).  You can push a button, even if you have the camera in manual mode, and it goes into a mode where someone that doesn't know how to use a camera can take very good pictures.  And the button for this mode glows blue- so you, the person telling the operator how to use your camera to take a picture of yourself with your significant other, can tell whether they're going to take a good picture or not, at a distance.  The glowing blue button also notifies my wife whether it's in \"her mode\" or not.  This feature has very little face time on positive reviews, and I find this feature, a simple glowing blue button, to be very useful.At very sensitive ISO levels, expect more noise than an awesome camera like the OM-D, but for 1600 and lower, the noise is almost non-existent.  In very low light situations I'll bump it to 3200, but it's very rare when I do that when working with a fast lens.If it had a built in EVF, it'd be everything I'd ever need in a compact system.

Portraits I have taken have had fabulous background separation, both with my adapted Pentax 50mm f/1.4 and with the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 pancake (which I highly recommend).  The low-light/high ISO performance is also well within acceptable ranges.  In theory, the Sony NEX series can provide better high-iso photos, but Sony pancake lens is a f/2.8.  Practically speaking, this means you need to use a higher ISO in similar light settings (IMO, a step backward in methodology) or you need to affix the much larger 35mm f/1.8 lens to the camera (putting a serious dent in the camera's pocketability).  No regrets on either of those fronts.My big reasons for buying the system were the lenses available and the portability.  Portability of this camera is wonderful.  Instead of carrying around my massive DSLR, I have something that will (just barely) fit into a pocket.  When taking street photographs, I almost never have \"that guy\" in my picture anymore (you know, the one looking directly at the camera with the burning hatred of a thousand suns glinting in his eyes).  This has made a huge difference in the number of usable photographs I get from a shoot.  I also no longer leave the camera at home or in the car.  Even if I'm going out and doing something social, I bring the camera with me because it isn't that much of a burden.  I have gotten some of my best shots because of this, do not underestimate the value of portability.  The lenses are also fabulous.  I have only used the 20mm f/1.7 pancake and the (slightly difficult to find) 14-45 f/3.5-5.6 Panasonic lenses.  Both have provided mind-blowing sharpness for the cost.  As a hobby photographer, I scoff at dropping huge sums of money on fabulously sharp lenses, so having two cheap lenses that produce magnificently sharp images is a real plus.  Spend the extra money on the older 14-45mm instead of the 14-42mm, you will not be disappointed.Relatively cheap, marvelously sharp, diminutive in size, full control over every function, the GX1 is a nearly perfect camera.  My only gripe?  I want more knobs and buttons!  Considering this camera cost me 1/4 of the Olympus EM-5, it is a fantastic value, but it still sorta handles like a compact point-and-shoot.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice and Compact Many Features and great IQ but..", "Author": "Chatoyer", "ReviewID": "R2NPWBHFDAI1M1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was torn between 4 and 5 stars on this, due to what I was comparing it against, and due to the price being cheaper(1/3, though with the must have EVF it's closer to 1/2) than one of the ones I'm having it go against. I decided to go to 4 stars for reasons mentioned below, but for some, this can be a 5 star camera. I have 2 other Micro Four Thirds, the E-PL1(got it for $140) and the Olympus OM-D E-M5. I got the GX1 first, then  the E-PL1 for long exposures and a backup, then the OM-D E-M5 recently.First, I'll go over what I liked: This camera is very nice. Image Quality with raws I loved, even at higher ISOs I could use ACR to clean up into nice pictures. I didn't shoot much in the 3200 range, and I mostly try to star 800 and below, but I liked some of my 1600 and a few 3200 pictures. This camera also has a lot of nice features I liked, including the Auto bracketing for HDR, the optional viewfinder(a must have), quick auto focus, accurate, nice video settings, though not fully designed for it like the GH series. From the moment I got the camera, I liked it, and the photos that came from it, on the Panasonic lenses I had (the 20mm f1.7, the 45mm f2.8 and the 45-200.)I also liked the size, I could fit it into larger pockets with the 20mm, and in some decently sized belt pouches if I couldn't fit it in pocket. I also liked the flash, although not great, the tilt feature and having it available unobtrusively is nice. The touch screen is pretty nice as well, allowing you to choose focus points, and the custom controls I definitely made use of. I tried it against the E-PL1 and, well, that's mixed. The GX1 seemed to have truer colors, and it took higher quality photos, but the Oly had nicer looking colors for certain shots. Still, as I mostly worked with raws(didn't quite like the jpegs), that didn't matter much to me, as it could be adjusted if desired in PP.The feel of the camera is very nice, I like the grip. Most of the buttons are nice too, though the wheel I have to say isn't my favorite. Trying to adjust quickly is a pain: sometimes I had a longer exposure saved in M mode, and normally use aperture. However, if I tried to switch back to M to manually expose a shot, it would take a bit of spinning to get the exposure to where I want it. There's also the fact that in M mode, it would sometimes change from shutter speed to apeture while I was turning it. Compared to the OMD's setup, this one is lacking. I do realize it saves space, however. The optional EVF makes for 3 points, and is nice, but it isn't cosmetically pretty, and hard to carry around while trying to be portable. Still recommended though.However, one of the things I like about the system is the ability to adapt other lenses to it, and the fact that we have two manufacturers producing excellent lenses, giving you a great range of lens selection. However, this lent to a small problem: Image Stabilization. I think Olympus has the better idea here, between the two companies. Panasonic cameras work excellently with Panasonic lenses (the also auto correct CA and stuff for Panasonic lenses). As you grow in focal length, however, they will be worse with any other lens, even MFT ones from Olympus or other third parties who don't use OIS. Since this was one of my favorite things about m43, I have to dock a star, even though I know this is a company policy. It's an important draw to the system for me and my brother, who unlike me, is married and on a stronger budget, meaning using adapted lenses is more ideal for him.  He uses the E-PL1 also, and definitely sees the benefit with his almost completely minolta adapted lens setup (he has my 14-42 kit, but no other MFT lenses.)After switching to the OMD, I noticed I could get more stabilized pictures on all my focal lengths, which especially helped me since I had purchased the 75mm and have a 200mm MF lens (the reason I use this, instead of my 45-200mm, is sometimes the MF lens is faster for me trying to get exactly what I want.) The versatility of the system just seems stronger here, you can use almost any lens you want, while with Panasonic, it feels you need to use their lenses. Additionally, I prefer primes to zooms. Panasonic seems to make very excellent zooms, and some excellent primes, while Olympus seems to do very well with Primes. Since I want to use primes from both companies, Panasonic's in lens design just isn't good for me.TL;DR:If you plan to use primarily Panasonic lenses, especially some of the expensive but good zooms like the 12-35 and the 35-100, or mostly Panasonic primes, then this camera is an excellent 5 star camera.If you plan to use other brand lenses, Olympus, Sigma, Adapted lenses, etc, then I'd rate it between 3.5 to 4 stars. You can definitely still get wonderful pictures out of it, and of course, OIS at certain focal lengths wouldn't help you with living or moving targets, but IBIS starts to shine better when using non-panasonic lenses, especially as you pass 45mm focal length.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding for HDR Images.  Be aware of different 14-42 lens sizes", "Author": "TrekAdvisor", "ReviewID": "R15GIT2ZL39YBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(I wrote a full blog up about how I'm learning to take insanely great pictures at [...] .  Here's an excerpt that has to do specifically w/ the GX1):I knew I wanted a camera that was much better than a point-and-shoot, yet I didn't want the bulk of carrying a DSLR around.  The camera had to be compact, yet functional.  It had to have interchangeable lenses and manual aperture and shutter controls.  After reading dozens of detailed reviews and hundreds of comments from users of various cameras in this category, I bought the Panasonic Lumix GX1.  For $659 you can get a camera and lens that fits all of these criteria.  Not only that, but this camera uses a new-ish standard called \"FourThirds\" which is a digital protocol across several camera manufacturers for interchangeable lenses with sensors that while smaller than DSLRs, are much larger than traditional point-and-shoot cameras (and the sensor size is the main limiting factor of point-and-shoot camera picture quality).  I've found that with this class of camera, sometimes called a \"mirrorless camera\" or \"micro 4/3 camera,\"  you get nearly the quality of a DSLR in a form factor that's compact enough to carry in a small bag (albeit not quite a pants pocket).Here are a few things to know about the GX1 specifically:All GX1s are not created equal!  There are two base models for the GX1.  The first has a manual 14-42mm zoom lens, which you can score for $469, while the second uses a power lens, also 14-42mm, but is much more compact.  It'll cost you $200 more, but to me it was worth the space savings (to see the comparison picture on my blog just Google \"danielodio insanely great pictures\" -- same body, vastly different lens sizes).  Having the more compact lens means I don't have to remove the lens when I take the camera in my backpack, and that means I'm more likely to take the camera with me to more places.  And as the old saying goes, 'the best camera is the one you have with you to take the shot.'  There are a few drawbacks to the more compact version besides the higher price tag.  Some reviewers on Amazon found ghosting in the images, although based on the reviews, that problem seems to have largely gone away in more recent production runs (I haven't noticed it).  But make sure to read the Amazon reviews to learn how to test for this.  Additionally, I've noticed that the power lens uses noticeably more battery than the manual lens, although you can shoot on & off for several hours with either one without a problem.  If you expect to be buying a number of lenses, you might want to stick with the base model and then add this very compact 20mm Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens which many owners rave about.Another small thing to know about the camera is that the charger light shows as a solid green when charging, and then turns off when charging is done.  A bit strange, as I thought when I dropped the battery in that solid green meant the battery was shipped full and charing was complete.Also, if I had an unlimited budget, I would've sprung for the Sony NEX-7 camera, but it costs $1,199 just for the body.  I couldn't justify the huge price gap between the two for the additional functionality of the NEX-7.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "super", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R1G0MGO9GD5PBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this camera.

I was in the market to upgrading/buying a camera that would be smaller than a conventional DSLR and would allow me to grow and learn about the technical parts of photography.  After much research, the Panasonic GX1 met these requirements.  I'll start with the picture quality;  After a few weeks of taking pictures in various conditions (low light, indoor / outdoor, evening, etc.) the pictures that comes out of the GX1 are crisp and lively.... just fantastic!  I have not played with the RAW function, yet. All pictures that I had taken are the standard format .JPG and they look great!  The build of the camera is solid; mostly metal housing with a very nice LCD touch-screen.  I don't have an issue with touch-screen interfaces as already I am a big fan (iPad user, here) and am familiar with the overall experience.  Some people may dislike it...for me, no issues here.  The interface is pretty easy to follow and not complicated.... I didn't even bother reading the user manual.  The lens can be interchangeable with other micro  4/3 lens; another reason why I chose this camera.  I already bought a 14mm Panasonic lens (pancake lens) to help make my camera more compact and easier to travel with. I pretty much shoot with these two different lenses (14-42 zoom and 14mm) depending on travel situations.  Panasonic has a handful of lenses that you can choose making another reason to buying the GX1.  Make sure you choose an SD card that is Class 10... this allows for faster response when shooting video and/or continuous shots.The Panasonic GX1 may be a little too much camera for a typical user but if you are like me (non-photographer), it is always a good thing to invest (if that is possible for electronic purchases) in something that you can grow into and may last you a few years.  Most importantly, take really great pictures.... bottom line.  If you are reading this review and are in a similar situation, I've done the research and recommend choosing the GX1.

Just in case you missed it, here's the least touted feature, and the one thing that sold me on this model:You can record video with this until the battery dies or the card fills up.Yes.  Really.The battery, when new, ran for a little over 3 hours for me.  Plugged into the wall, it just goes and goes.  My 32gb cards report they will hold four (4) hours of video at the top quality setting.  My 128gb cards report 13+ hours of capacity.  I've only tried for about six.  No problems.Caveats:1. This is a US model.  I've read, but not confirmed, that this is a feature of every GX1 that is not bound for the EU.  As long as you get a non EU version of the GX1, you should have this same unlimited video feature.2. This is only true in AVCHD mode.  MPEG video will still get cut off at a 4gb file size.3. Video at top quality takes up about 8gb per hour of video.  Make sure you have room BEFORE you shoot!4. The GX1 does not allow manual controls during video.  The exception is aperture.  With M43 native lenses, you can adjust the aperture in iA mode.  ISO and shutter will adjust to compensate.  (a hack with ptool is in development, but as of 10/10/2012, it's not available)For performances/wedding ceremonies, this is an indispensable tool.  It's tiny enough to mount on a \"gorilla pod\" (assuming you use lightweight native lenses).  The video quality is superb with native lenses and very good to so/so with my Nikon lenses.  I find that stopping down too much can make things mushy.  Since since you can't control the shutter/ISO directly, ND filters are a must to stay out of the mushy end of the aperture range.Besides video, this makes an excellent replacement for an ever-present pocket cam, especially when paired with something like the 14mm/2.5 lens.  I find I'm leaving my DSLRs home more often.  Stills quality isn't on par with my D700, but it gives my D7000 a good run for the money.To sum it up, this is a great camera for anybody who wants to shoot video with a larger sensor AND needs to shoot longer than 30 minutes.  Since lenses can be adapted, it's also a cheap way to give M43 video a try without buying a whole new system of lenses.Cheers!

But, in bright sun, the display is somewhat difficult to see (which is true with every camera I have used).  You can get an electronic viewfinder, but the cost will end up being more than the G3.2.

It does not do HD video at the same level as the GH-2 (1080i versus 1080p).4.  The folding zoom lens has corner softness issues, and the less expensive lens is rather large.

It is also very small - the third smallest M43 camera on the market, I believe. I was highly skeptical of the original Four Thirds format when it was introduced in Olympus SLR bodies. The reduction of the body size didn't seem to justify the drop in sensor quality or increase in low light noise. But as sensors got better, and Four Thirds was replaced by Micro Four Thirds, cameras got a lot smaller, and a new enthusiast platform was born.Micro Four Thirds will impress a first time user. It produces shots just as rich as an SLR, provided they are not action photos. That means that Micro Four Thirds is limited to landscape, portrait, architecture, and street photography. For many enthusiasts, that's enough. Another thing to keep in mind is that with this platform, prime lenses are the best way to go for maximum sharpness and largest aperture. The GX1 with any prime lens produces images that are almost too sharp. The sharpness has won me over, and I think / hope that I have found my favorite digital photography platform.Anyone tying this camera after using a APS-C SLR is going to be pretty impressed. It has manual aperture and shutter control. It has a large array of creative, in-camera effects. It might even test your assumption that RAW files are superior to JPEGs. I have to say, the in-camera processing has become so good in today's mirrorless cameras, that I am on the verge of giving up the RAW format. Micro Four Thirds gives us all a chance to trust the camera more, spend less time using post processing software, and spend more time experimenting and shooting with the camera. In fact, I probably spend more time naming my photos than toying with the contrast and saturation in my photo editor. The JPEG output from the camera is most often the best image.The GX1 differs from most other cameras in the Micro Four Thirds platform. It is intentionally super compact. It is slightly retro, but not obviously so (as with the Olympus OM-D series). The grip is fantastic, allowing for easy one-handed use. Just walk and shoot. For street photographers, this is a great little camera. Most of your subjects will hardly know they they are in the shot. And that's a big selling point for Micro Four Thirds. Without a big SLR, there is less chance of you intimidating or scaring away your subjects. The GX1 also offers an option LCD viewfinder, which brings this camera close to the rangefinder experience. I remember shooting with a Contax G2 in the late 90s. This camera oddly reminds me of it. Similar portability and versatility, and both produce great, sharp images to last a lifetime.I can't recommend this platform enough, and the GX1 is still a great place to start.

I have an EP1 and loved it except for the poor ergonomics, dense weight and the lack of an EVF. I also have a GH2, a great camera with a great feature set but uses it mainly for video; the form factor is just too big and too pretend SLR like for a walking around camera.I was hoping for the GX1 to be more like a refined GH2 with the features and hardware but in a more NEX like form factor. I was very disappointed with the GX1 when it came out....no tilt screen, no view finder and another different battery. I was ready to jump ship and go over to the Sony NEX camp except that I already have invested in several M4/3 lenses and is generally quite pleased with the overall system.Amazon had the Olympus EPL1 on sale for $150 and it basically had most of the GX1 features except for a 12mp sensor. The EPL1 became my #1 carry around cam and worked really well with the 20/1.7 and the 7-14 zoom.  When my trusty EPL1 developed a vertical strip of dead pixels across the frame, I needed to shop for a replacement. The Lumix GX1 by now had dropped in price and now at $250 (body only), it is a no brainer replacement for my dead EPL1.I liked it immediately out of the box.It is small....S M A L L, almost the same size as my Lumix P&S;, just the right weight (not heavy like the OLympus EP1), very good build quality (not plasticky like the GH2) It has all the right features and took very good images, on par with the GH2. The controls are well placed with the right heptic feedback, the touchscreen worked great, just the right sensitivity. The UI and layout is almost identical to the GH2. Focus is very fast for an older M4/3, as fast as the GH2. With a 15mm/f8 Olympus \"lens cap\" lens, this camera actually fits into my jeans pants pocket !!  I challenge any inter-changable lens camera to do that!The down side for me is of course the lack of a built in EVF (ref NEX7)  and no tilt/ flip screen (ref GH2). I am ordering the LVF2 for $160, which I think is too expensive for what it is, but would allow me to see what I am framing without constantly taking my glasses on and off. It is hard for us old guys to frame and focus arms out using the LCD screen.This camera at $599 would be overpriced and be lost in the sea of similar cameras ....EP2, EP3, EPL 1,2,3 et al, GF2,3,5..... all offering similar price and features; however now at $250, this is the bargain of the year. Nothing at this price point touches it. Not something that offers pro features and controls. With the 20mm/f1.7, it can give the Canon G1x and the Nikon Coolpix A a good run for the money. It is of course not in the same league as the Nex7 or the Fuji 100s.For me, to make it perfect, it will need a quality M4/3 sensor, a decent built in EVF and a proper flip screen and focus peaking.........and an external mike jack please, plus wireless remote.How about it, Panasonic? Olympus? Anyone?May 28, added LVF 2 viewfinderThe $160 view finder takes this little camera to a new level. Manual focus using legacy lenses is now possible.  I have no problems looking through the entire frame with glasses on. It does not auto switch between LCD screen and finder but turning the thumb wheel will put the image on the LCD for review, and touching the shutter button returns it to the LVF. The viewfinder is clear and lag free under most conditions. A slight judder under low light indoors Wien panning. The image quality is similar to my GH2.  The GX1 can magnify just the center portion of the screen for framing and focusing at the same time but the cropped image is fuzzy and not sharp like the full magnification image. There is no focus peaking or any other aid but that is the way the camera is. For $160 , it is a bit expensive but still a good buy. BTW, the unit is quite small, smaller than it looks in photos. The horseshoe mount is locking but the durability is questionable. I would not leave any clip on viewfinder mounted on the camera when placed in a camera bag or pocket. The part just sticks out like a sore thumb and will put unnecessary load on the hot shoe. I think this tiny VF should be built in as part of the camera , and still retain a compact form factor, like the NEX 6/7 , but this is better than nothing.Let's make sure we have it in the GX2!", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Patience pays", "Author": "Sean U", "ReviewID": "R3A9T6PU4U8O3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an amazing deal at the current price. I have been using a GF-1 for years, patiently waiting for the price to drop on the GX1. The camera is much more usable at ISO 1600 than the GF1, and it is not too bad at 3200. With the 20mm 1.7, focus speed seems about the same as the GF1, while my 14-45 OIS seems to be a little bit faster on the GX1. I've been using the touch screen mostly for moving the AF point around to where I need it. The camera is solidly built and has a quality feel to it. The flash can be pointed toward the ceiling to bounce, but it is a little tricky to lock in position. I have also set the camera to use the Auto-ISO feature, which sets the shutter speed to about 2x the focal length if it can without exceeding the max ISO you set. I was also able to attach OpTech pro-loop connectors to the strap lugs, which was not possible on the GF1. I haven't had a chance to try out the 1080i video yet, but since my main concern is photography, I'm happy to say it is a worthwhile upgrade to the GF-1.

I 'm glad I did, as it is now my favorite.  This camera was probably a bit overpriced when first introduced and then overshadowed by all the brouhaha over the Olympus OM-D, but at its present price point, it is an absolute bargain.  It is well-constructed, compact and feels very substantial in hand, with buttons and dials where I like them.  I have the silver color, a beautiful, slightly mauve silver that is much nicer than it appears on the website.  But the camera's color wouldn't matter one bit if it didn't deliver nice photos, which this camera does very well.  You can shoot raw if that's your thing, but I am quite happy with the jpegs this camera produces after I adjust the settings to my taste. And there are many settings, so you need to take a little time and play with it a bit if you want to take advantage of what this camera has to offer. The menus are easy to navigate, with many customizing options not found on other cameras in this class.  One of my favorites: I can reduce the focus area to a very small spot and place it anywhere in the frame.  The camera has a nice touch screen interface, and probably decent video, but I don't use these functions much so I won't comment on them.  Obviously, the camera doesn't have a built-in viewfinder, and although you can buy one separately, or get a G3 with nearly the same specs, it would ruin the GX form factor.  If this camera had a built-in corner viewfinder like the one on the Sony Nex-7, it would've been a 5-star product.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Clear Improvement Over the GF1", "Author": "Daniel Grant", "ReviewID": "R15N48DCHZ90B7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the successor to the GF1, Panasonic's original 4/3 Enthusiast Compact. There are 2 significant improvements that make it worth the money to step up to the GX1. First, the GX1 is slightly (but noticeably) smaller and lighter. Even though it's smaller and lighter, the GX1 is still (in my opinion) just as easy to use as its predecessor. This is a big because size and weight are obviously a major reason why anyone would buy a micro 4/3 camera. The GX1 is easier to carry around and with the 20mm pancake lens I'd even describe it as fairly pocketable (the same is probably true with the collapseable kit lens but I'd steer clear of that option until Panasonic fixes the vibration bug which seems to plague that lens). Anyway I think the GX1 is even easier to carry around on a daily basis than the GF1, which for me will translate to more shots taken. Also, the excellent and intuitive control layout of the GX1 has mostly been preserved (unlike the later GF models which now seem to be aimed more at the point and shoot audience and rely far more on their touchscreen controls). The GF1 also offers a pretty decent touchscreen layout but I don't really care for touchscreen controls on a camera so I pretty much ignore them. Still you do have the option if its important to you. Anyway the other compelling reason to step up to the GX1 is the new 16MP MOS (backlit CMOS?) sensor. This is also a clear improvement over the GF1's sensor, not so much for the extra megapixels (12 is more than plenty for virtually anyone. I've blown up pics from the GF1 to 8*10 after cropping them by half and they still look amazing) but the sensor from the GX1 is easily a stop better than the GF1's sensor, and the processor also does a better job processing jpegs than the GF1's,  producing compressed pictures that are punchier but also more lifelike. There was nothing specifically wrong with the GF1 in this area but the GX1 still represents a noticeable improvement in my opinion. The only 4/3 based camera with a better sensor is Olympus's E-M5 which is a different beast entirely (for starters it retails for nearly 3 times the price). Panasonic also thoughtfully made the popup flash fully articulating so you can bounce it off the ceiling (at least if the ceiling is low, just because you can angle the thing like a speedlight doesn't mean its got the same range). Finally, the GX1 does also improve slightly over the GF1 in terms of speed and responsiveness (not that I ever found the GF1 lacking in that area). To sum up then the GX1 is not just a great micro 4/3 camera, its good enough to make it worth your while to trade up from a perfectly good GF1. This is also my personal favorite mirrorless compact. The NEX series may have a bigger sensor and the E-M5 is an incredible camera but I don't think any camera packs more possibilities into a smaller package than the GX1. Granted, to really match up with the NEX cameras in low light you'd need to buy the new 12-35mm 2 f2.8 lens which would make the for a kit that's even more expensive than the E-M5, but there are a bunch of subtle advantages to the GX1 even with the kit lens (noticeably better quality lenses, built in flash, better metering, more accessible manual controls, and the big one for me is better balance and portability due to the smaller lenses). Anyway, this class of camera is all about the compromise between size, weight, and capability, and the GX1 comes closest to my personal ideal. Its a teriffic choice if you're already a fan of Panasonic since the GX1 is both more capable than and smaller than its predecessor. The one other thing worth mentioning here though is once you buy something with detachable lenses and a hotshoe, you aren't just buying a camera, but a system. The best thing about the GX1 from the perspective of a new buyer is that Panasonic makes what are generally considered to be the best micro 4/3 lenses. The however, the E-M5 would be arguably the basis for the most capable mirrorless 4/3 kit. With a high quality weather-sealed lens, and the right add-on flash the E-M5 could make a pretty compelling (and incredibly lightweight) semi-pro system. My GX1 can't do this, rather its imo the ultimate walkaround shooter, the absolute best camera small enough for me to actually bring everywhere and use. Also, if you've already used an NEX and like the system, don't buy one of these sight unseen.(Especially if you've invested in extra lenses, even with these mirrorless cameras the lenses can quickly become more expensive and longer lived than the cameras themselves). If you took a vote out of all reviewers, the GX1 would probably get a bit higher marks than an NEX, but there's no absolute answer as to whether great manual controls, built in flash, and great lenses are preferable to a real APS-C sensor and Sony's menu system optimized for more automated even paired with somewhat larger and less capable lenses. Anyway, to sum up I personally love this camera, it's great for anyone who already bought into the Panasonic system (as I did) and a worthwhile upgrade to any of the GF line. For a new purchaser, its place is as the ultimate walkaround camera. But no mirrorless camera is the best at everything. Right now I think Panasonic, Olympus, Sony, and even Nikon mirrorless compacts have their place (Nikons are about absolutely minimal size and maximum simplicity they're actually too small for my hands and also not as good as Sony, Panasonic, or Olympus due to their sub 4/3 sensors). The only brands I would specifically recommend against are Samsung (between the mediocre non-corrected lenses, slow RAW, and JPEG processing issues its got an APS-C sensor that's not even capable of matching the micro 4/3 cameras), Canon (nothing wrong with their picture quality but its so huge why not just buy a Rebel and be done with it?), and the Pentax Q.

It is unique not only in that it is currently the only GX model camera (slotted above the GF and G series models, with the GH series being the top end models offered by Panasonic), but it also has a very solid body construction that has a higher quality feel in the hands even when compared to the higher end GH2.  While the newly introduced GH3 has beefed up the body construction for the highest-end Lumix series, it is significantly heavier and cost about triple the amount of the GX1.  For comparison purposes, the body including SD card and batteries for the GX1, GH2, and GH3 are approximately 11.22 ounces, 15.66 ounces, and 19.40 ounces respectively.  Wow, yes, the GX1 is light yet packs almost all of the features of the GH2!During this Christmas holiday my GX1 saw the most action.  I currently own a few Lumix products including the GH2, the GX1, and the GF3 plus six Lumix lenses: 14-42 kit, 14 pany, 20 pany, 25mm, 14-42 GX, and the 45-175 GX.  While the GH2 serves as my primary camera due to it's higher HD video capabilities (i.e. GH2 shoots up to 24Mbps un-hacked versus GX1 at 20Mbps), there are many times when I prefer the GX1 for quick still image shots since the dials and menu systems feel easy and quick to access and control.  I especially like to pair my GX1 with the 14 pany or the 20 pany which provides me with a great quality fast auto-focus hybrid camera that is extremely portable.In summary, I highly recommend the Lumix GX1 which has a uniquely solid quality feel in the hands yet somehow Panasonic managed to fit all the bells and whistles into such a light body.  The camera has a very good touch screen system, has a very capable Live MOS 16.68 MegPix image sensor, utilizes the high speed 3 core processor Venus Engine 3DNR, and has a built-in flash that pops up at the push of a button.

They were old then, but I loved them.  I have done semi-pro photography, i.e. weddings, press photography, advertising- all on the side and not as my sole source of income.  So I know cameras.  I bought two other Lumix cameras in the past- a small point-and-shoot with a Leica lens built in that I bought in Peru when I left my camera in a cab, and the TS2 waterproof.  Both served me well except the one I got in Peru the screen went out.  I always suspected maybe it was a gray-market camera.  What I love about Lumix is the availability of Leica lenses, and I am a die-hard fan of Leica.I really wanted a Leica M8 but I don't have $8,000 to drop for one.  The DX1 offers Leica lenses and has the old-school rangefinder styling.  I was looking for a camera to carry on long backpack trips.  After hiking the Camino de Santiago carrying a Nikon D80 I was wishing for something more portable.  Everything I read about the DX1 was good so I got one, expecting that it would be a backup for the DSLR and also for long hiking trips where I needed a quality compact.  Well I believe the DX1 is going to be my first choice now and the Nikon will actually be the backup.First off, it's a Micro 4/3 camera, so those posting about the image quality need to sit down.  It's not a full-frame DSLR.  I am betting that one day soon there will be a full frame mirrorless and when that day comes I will ditch DSLR's for good.  The technology these days with live LCD viewfinders is good enough now to replace the cumbersome mirror.  However, back to my first statement on image quality- it appears with the first few test shots that the image quality is just about as good and in some cases better than my D80 with 18-55.  Compared to the 14-42 shooting a picture of the box the camera came in with both cameras and then enlarging it, I found the Nikon picture to be slightly less sharp.  I am not ready to conclude that statement before I take more tests, but given that I was expecting the Nikon to be way more sharp, I was very pleased with this first test.What I love is the old-school rangefinder look and feel when shooting.  It's just a doggone sexy camera.  If you want a small camera that has big-camera features and quality, this is the camera for you.  I couldn't think of a better backpacking/travel camera other than maybe a Leica which is way out of the price range.I have the 14-42 lens now, but I ordered a 45-200 as soon as I got the camera.  That lens has not yet arrived.  I also went on eBay and bought the 14-45 lens which is supposed to be much better than the 14-42.  Without yet testing that lens, I can tell you already I see why they say don't get the 14-42.  Get the body only, then buy the 14-45 lens.  The 14-42 has horrible vignetting at widest setting (14mm).  There is also some light abberation showing around the edges of objects.  However, I am giving five stars to the CAMERA because it's awesome.  The 14-42 isn't the greatest lens.I was amazed by the OIS.  I shot a handheld shot at 1 full second and it was almost perfect.  There was the slightest bit of blur when enlarged.  That blew me away!  Note- I have a nack for hand-held shots having for years done available light photography.  Most people probably can't hold the camera steady at that speed.  Still, I could see the average joe shooting at 1/30 with no shake with the OIS.  Suddenly the f:3.5-5.6 doesn't seem so bad since I can hand-hold longer exposures.  With the Nikon 18-200 VR lens at wide zoom I can hand-hold down to about 1/15 second without noticeable shake.  With the lumix I would say I can go one more click.The horizon line option in the viewfinder is awesome.  As said above, I have a nack for hand-holding long exposures, but I suck at getting the horizon straight!!!  The horizon line level is easy to use and doesn't take up much of the screen so I leave it on all the time.  One click of a button and it goes away if you don't like it.The video is very impressive.  I am not much of a video guy, but I did some test shots and they are clear, crisp, and have excellent color.  I did find that the focus went blurry when I was filming a guy kiteboarding and tried to go from the kiteboarder to the kite.  It seemed like it hunted for focus before going to infinity when I went for the shot of the sky with just the kite.  Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.  There are three different focus settings.  One stays put where you focus it, one is an active focus, and one apparently continuosly adjusts focus- I have not figured out yet the difference between the last two.  I did a test with a pool ball rolling it slowly on the pool table and the focus was a little slow at tracking it in video mode.  However, in still mode where you click the shutter lightly to focus it focused instantly.  I mean a fraction of a second from close up to infinity.I love that there are options for different scene modes so my wife can play around with those, as she doesn't get the whole f-stop thing, but she can set it for \"sunset\" or \"portrait\" or other modes and let the camera do that for her.  For me I can set it for aperture priority, shutter priority, put rogram, or if I want to just point and shoot there is a convenient \"intelligent auto\" button.  The ia works great and I like that the button lights up blue to remind me that it is on.The flash is not terrible, and I like that it pops up so it can aim over the lens, but you do have to remove the lens shade or it casts a shadow in the picture.  Not a huge deal- just worth noting.  What I love most about the flash is that you can take your thumb and point it up when you shoot and bounce it off the ceiling.  This probably wasn't what it was designed for, but it works great!  Since the flash is spring loaded and pops up it's easy to hold it facing skyward to do bounce flash photography.  Definately if you do a lot of flash stuff you will want to get an accessory flash.  For me it works just fine, and I don't expect a built-in flash to be more than just a basic flash for the stock lens, so I think it qualifies for a good review.  Some reviews I have seen knock the flash for being less than adequate, but I found that it worked fine for using the kit lens indoors taking normal shots.  That's what built-in flashes are for.I just love this camera and recommend it to anyone wanting to step up from point and shoot, or step down from DSLR, but don't think that by stepping down you are loosing much, because the image quality is excellent.  It is a smaller sensor than a Nikon D90, so of course it will not match the quailty exactly, but it's way better than I expected, and compared to the D80 as mentioned above, I found it to be pretty on par and even saw crisper edges when photographing the barcode on the box as a test image.  Again I need to mention that I have not yet done a scientific side-by-side comparison to the D80, but preliminary shots show it's going to at least not be a step down in image quality.  Compared to my brother's D90 I think it will certainly be a step down in image quailty, but way better than I ever expected.Mark my words, the DSLR is headed for a dismal future as mirrorless cameras get better.  As soon as they come out with a full frame mirrorless I think there would be little reason to get a DSLR anymore.  The new digital viewfinder technology is good enough now to replace the DSLR mirrored optical viewfinders in my opinion.  The ability to have insane FPS, less camera shake, and all the other stuff that goes along with mirrorless to me will one day make mirrorless dominate.  For now, however, with the micro 4/3 I think it's a darned good second and for backpacking and travel where you need a smaller camera I think it should be your first choice.  At least it is mine!I do want to mention about the shutter.  Someone commented that it is loud and may cause camera shake.  It is a little loud... not \"loud\" but definately audible.  I love that!  It has a very old-school sound to it- \"kachick\"... definately not a Leica, but I kind of like the old school sound.  My wife as well grinned when she took the first picture and said, \"I love the way it sounds.\"  You KNOW you just took a picture!  However, definately not stealth.  As for camera shake, I didn't find that.  I took a shot at one second- how much better do you want?I love that you can use old film camera lenses like Leica M and R lenses, Nikon and Canon lenses.  I have a whole case of Nikon A1's that I will adapt, and some Leica R lenses that I cannot wait to use again.  You have to use them in manual mode, but if you have old film camera gear then probably that's how you used to shoot and if you are like me you kind of enjoy shooting in manual.By the way, I did check out the manual focus and I like that the screen zooms in for focusing.  Not sure if it does that with the eyepiece attachment.  I think it would be annoying with that, but it works great when using the built-in screen.  I found the lens very easy to focus despite some reviews that said it was weird focusing with the electronic \"focus by wire\".  I found it very smooth and it felt like I was focusing with an old manual lens.  It was very quick to achieve focus.I love that you get two personal settings on the dial to set up the way you shoot the most along with the aperture priority, shutter priority, and program modes.  The \"art mode\" or whatever they call is kind of useless to me, but my wife likes it.  I prefer to do all that in processing rather than when shooting.  I also like that there are programmable function buttons, although I have not yet figured out how to program them.  I would probably make one to switch easily to manual focus rather than having to click to a screen and then click sideways to the manual focus icon and press enter.  One click to go to manual focus would be much easier.I do find that with my extra large hands the camera is approaching too small. Not really a complaint.  I am saying I don't see how you could get it any smaller without making it hard to use.  I do find that my hand covers up the low-light focusing infrared light.  I have to adjust the way I hold the camera.  I also can't grip it the way I can my D80, but it's a small camera and that's what you get when you look for a smaller camera.  I prefer to have it more portable and not have the big handgrip, so it's not a bad trade-off.

First off, it's smaller than any DSLR with nearly the same quality of images.  There aren't as many accessories and the capabilities are somewhat limited compared to high end DSLRs, but overall it has enough for a beginner or as a backup.  I chose the GX1 over the GF5 because it has slightly higher specs.  I'm also a fan of the thumb wheel.  The GF5 is harder to use under manual mode.  The GX1 is also larger/chunkier compared to the GF5, but I think it fits my hands a lot better, especially with the rubber grip.  This is most apparent when using larger lenses.  Like any camera or new technology, there is a learning curve, but if you put time into it, it's easy to navigate and use over a short time.  There are a few minor things I don't like about the camera though.  The 14-42mm kit lens is pretty bad.  Honestly, the functioning of the lens itself is not horrible, but it's very poorly built.  The mounts are plastic and the zoom and focus rings feel like there's sand inside because it's so rough.  There is a reasonably large selection of lenses on the market for Lumix micro 4/3s, and Olympus lenses use the same mount as well.  (If you're not looking to get a set of lenses to compliment the GX1, I would recommend the Lumix LX7 instead.  I got my dad one and it's an amazing fixed lens camera.)  The neck strap is also horrible.  It's made of a cheap stiff fake leather, and it's IMO too short.  It get's the job done, but I would recommend getting a better one down the road.  My last gripe is that the body is too small for some lenses when using a tripod.  Some of the larger lenses like the Panny 45-200mm or the 14-140mm have diameters that extend past the bottom of the camera, so when mounted on a tripod, the platform rests on the edge of the lens rather than the camera body.  I didn't get too much into the nitty gritty specs, but I would definitely recommend the GX1 to anyone looking for a manual interchangeable lens camera, especially if you're looking at lower end DSLRs.  It's a great compromise since you're getting the function in a smaller package.  Another big reason I bought a Lumix is because several of my friends have Lumix m4/3s and we swap lenses sometimes.

I've been seriously spoiled since then. It was small, quiet and with my help, took great pics. Fast-forward about 35 years, and after a long stretch of doing other things, I finally decided to dive back into photography. My 16mp Lumix wasn't cutting it because I needed the ability to shoot RAW and bracket my shots. I searched high and low, and even ordered a weatherproof Pentax thinking it, being smaller than the Canons or Nikons would take the place of my OM-1. It was nice, but even as small as it was, it was still heavy and bulky so I returned it. Not only that, but it would be difficult to adapt my Zuiko lenses to the Pentax. Enter the Lumix GX1. Gosh, if I could sit down and write down everything I wanted from a camera, it would be the GX1. Oh sure, there are minor things here and there that I suppose could be improved, but honestly, I couldn't tell you what they might be. I LOVE this camera. Seriously. It's got the chops to give me what I want from a camera which is semi-professional fine art photography. It's small, well made, easy to use, relatively quiet and sexy as all get out.

The touchscreen is responsive and the button/dial placements feel natural and are easy to use. I also have the adapter that allows use of canon EF lenses on this camera, allowing me to double my lens library access.The only downside for some is the way this camera saves video files to the sd memory card. It saves it as some weird format not easily recognized by the computer so one has to download some kind of converter or own Final Cut Pro to save them to a hard drive. And even then you have to hunt for the video files in some folder a few levels down from the top level so they certainly didn't make it easy for video transferring.

No, actually, perfect.", "Author": "Magister Ludi", "ReviewID": "RLTCTVUDB7UFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased with baited breath to replace the marvelous GF1 that I've been beating around since it was introduced.  This GX1 is everything the original should have been; 16mp, stereo full AVCHD @ 30p, capable of a much higher res viewfinder (the LVF2), and a bunch of smaller improvements.  To Panasonic's immense credit they kept all the features which made the GF1 such a hit: well thought out manual controls, hard switches and dials well placed, superb build quality, and, not least, a scintillating \"cool\" factor.But the best feature is the sensor itself, which is sensitive and detailed enough to be used for pictorial and people photography, to my taste anyway, easily @ 3200 and even fairly well @ 6400. In LR3 and LR4 the raws allow for fantastic color and detail.At last, this year, there's a pretty good selection of lenses for the MFT format, and the Panasonics continue to amaze.  I own the 20 f/1.7, the 7-14mm f/4.0, the 45-200 kit lens, the new Olympus 45mm f/1.8 (which works perfectly and automatically with the GX1), and the new Samyang/Rokinon 7.5mm fisheye.  All these lenses compare at least favorably with the Nikon & even Hasselblad gear which I've been using commercially for about 30 years (with the possible exception of the 45-200, though for the money that's a damn nice zoom).  The LVF2 viewfinder is a huge improvement over the GF1's LVF1 POS, if you want to use a viewfinder (I do when I'm using the longer lenses, at least partly for the stability of a third point of contact).Also new in this model is an \"intelligent\" mode, which read as \"idiot-proof\", activated by a glowing blue physical button atop the body, which my darling wife could press whenever she wanted to take a picture with complete automation and circumvent all the weird custom settings I usually use.

The GX-1 is my first mirrorless, and is a TRUE winner.Build quality is wonderful, very solid, design is stunning, it's a gorgeous camera. IQ (image quality) is outstanding, I'd say 90% of the Nikon D700. And last, operation and user interface is just among the best available in any camera body today. The touchscreen, which I first thought I would never use, has become a feature I could absolutely NOT live without anymore.The very few cons : short battery life (to the point of annoyance). Continuous AF is sort of useless, as it is on every single m4/3 camera. Single AF is rumoured to be the best of any m4/3 body, which I easily believe, as it is excellent. Can't use external viewfinder AND external flash at the same time, which for me pretty much kills the possibility of manual focusing old lenses.Other than that, it's an absolute winner, VERY understated due to being shadowed by the more recent and extremely hyped Olympus E-M5, and probably the best bang for the buck in Mirrorless today.I positively adore this camera, it has unleashed my creativity like no other.", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, lousy lens!", "Author": "Dave \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R3O6IDVORH6TT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'd give this camera four or five stars if that's all I was reviewing.

Pelham", "ReviewID": "R1VRUWPAXWYCX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because of its small size, huge suite of features, and because, with a minimal adapter, I can use all my old Leica lenses.  Before purchase I read many reviews including a couple of negative ones.  This alerted me to watch for potential issues that I might have with the camera, such as odd color rendition, noisy shutter, etc.  I am puzzled by most of these, and am very satisfied with this camera!  I do wish the shutter was a little quieter, but this is far from a deal-breaker and I find it is not nearly as loud as most SLR's, but certainly louder than my M series Leicas.I was warned by SLR users who had transitioned to digital that my old Leica lenses would probably not work well adapted for digital due to focus field differences.  Not true in this case!  While I loose the camera's automatic features, I have had sharp, beautiful pictures with every lens.  Lieca lenses, at least the old ones, are flat-field lenses and my 50 mm f2 Summicron, 90 mm f4 Elmar, 125 mm f2.5 Hektor, and 200 mm f4.5 Telyt have all given excellent results.  The Summicron and Hektor have been especially nice due to their \"fast\" apertures in the mild - medium telephoto range.  Lack of auto-focus has not been a big issue with the manual focus magnification system on this camera.  The 90 mm Elmar has also been very useful and convenient because of its compact size.  And I haven't even mentioned the huge selection of native Panasonic/Leica lenses, which are reportedly fine in their own right, though I have only minimal experience within that large range.When I received the camera I immediately tested it in very low-light situations, as avoiding the need for using flash was one of my primary interests.  I found pushing the ISO as far as 3200 still produced very acceptable results.  Even going beyond this will produce acceptable results depending on the type and purpose of the photography you are doing.  Combining this ability with the f2 Summicron proved to be great fun, even lacking the image stabilization.Wading through the PDF manual and the long lists of menu items has proven to be the biggest challenge, then remembering where to find a particular feature quickly when needed... requires experience!  Having said that, the interface is logical and functional and I do stumble my way through even features I haven't studied successfully.

Plus, with this pancake lens, the camera is low-profile and unobtrusive and perfect for candid shots. The issues with camera I've encountered are with the video. The basic image quality is again fantastic under low light conditions. The problem is that auto-focus tends to wander around in and out of focus, even when not panning. Even with little or no movement of camera or subject, the focus will be perfect for 10-15 seconds and then go out for a while. Also there is considerable periodic motor noise which strangely seems to occur frequently even when no focus adjustments are being made. Possibly using manual focus for videos would be better but I haven't tried it as I have middle-aged eyes and can't easily resolve the LCD screen close-up to evaluate focus.

There are numerous pluses and minuses with every compact system camera. At the time of purchase, the Panasonic GX1 had a greater selection of lenses, faster autofocus, great set of controls, including a touch screen (resistive, not capacitive like your smart phone), ease of use, small compact body + lens, and very good overall image quality.Eventually I sold the kit lens and purchased the Leica 25mm F1.4 Summilux lens which has been an outstanding purchase. No other compact system camera has a lens that comes close to the F1.4 Leica but here's where the tradeoffs start.Both Sony and Canon's Compact System Cameras (CSC's) have larger sensors than Panasonic and Olympus. Sony's sensors are also some of the best in the business. The sample images I've seen have incredible dynamic range. The images could easily compete with, and even surpass entry level DSLR's (even my Panasonic GX1 makes better pictures than my Uncle's Rebel and my cousin's T2i Canon's). The thing  I didn't like about Sony was their lens selection. Their kit lens is fine but if you want a really fast, good performing, all purpose lens, there isn't any to be found.Sony's 16mm F2.8 is nice, but it's wide angle lens, not great for portraits and not particularly fast either. Sony's 50mm F1.8 is not bad, but it's a lens better suited for portraits, rather than all round use. When you look at the overall size of these lenses, they are larger and heavier than Panasonic's which takes a bit away from the portability factor, not to mention the lens looks a bit out of proportion on such a small camera body.Each of Sony's CSC's is different, but overall, they are a tad more difficult to use. the Sony NEX 5 does make things better with one programmable button which can be set for white balance or other commonly used setting. The Panasonic GX1 has the most commonly used buttons at your disposal and doesn't bury some important settings deep into the menus like Sony does.Because none of the lenses in Sony's e-mount lineup are that fast, making that really nice big smooth, silky bokeh is pretty much impossible. A decent bokeh can be made with the 50mm F1.8, but nothing compared with the 25mm F1.4. If you don't care for bokeh, then Sony's is the system for you. The electronic stabilization on Sony's CSC's does allows them to take very good low light photos with great dynamic range.So why did I buy the Panasonic GX1 when Sony's cameras have so much going for them? For me, the overall package of smaller, faster, lighter lenses, (& body) and intuitive, easy to use interface won me over. The image quality and balance of the GX1 is superb. It beat the pants off my Nikon D40 and made it look embarrassingly bad. I no longer need flash in low light situations because the 25mm F1.4 lens can let in so much light. My camera is still quite small, although not pocketable. I can carry it around my shoulder with ease. It goes in a very small case when not in use.Do I wish the GX1 had the same dynamic range of the Sony NEX cameras? Yes, I do. But with every choice currently in the CSC market there are tradeoffs. IMO, no manufacturer has completely hit it on the nose. Both Canon and Nikon have a small offering of lenses for their CSC cameras in comparison and IMO are not as refined as Panasonic, Sony, or Olympus.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "very sharp photos. fast, 1.4 lens. great for most situations other than action sports.", "Author": "ken cazeneuve", "ReviewID": "R7SGGD3NZ4K90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "panasonic GF1, GF3 , G5  all mirrorless small interchangable lens cameras.

Unfortunately, I find the GX-1's images to be slightly soft-looking right out of the box. By going to the Photo Style menu and increasing the sharpness while decreasing noise reduction, I was able to achieve results similar to the default settings on the Olympus E-P1 using the same lens.Bottom line (for me) is that I will probably buy an Olympus E-P5 in a couple of years when the price drops. But, I'll keep the GX-1 for portrait work, where the creamier image is often flattering to a human subject, but may detract from landscapes or industrial objects. The one feature I really do like about the GX-1 is the capability to use the touch screen to focus selectively on a part of the image and fire the shutter. This works great for shots in gardens where branches and leaves may confuse the intended focus point.

I feel that the technology is mature enough to take the dive, supported by a wide variety of available lenses positioned towards various segments of customers by both Panasonic and Olympus. I purchased this during the brief sale whereby this unit with the powerzoom lens was 399.99 on amazon. I also have the non-PZ 14-42mm cheapo lens that came with my GF5 which I no longer use because the PZ is so much more compact and convenient for travel. Alot of folks have written negative reviews of the X Series 14-42mm power zoom but in my use, I did not notice any of the blurry pictures many owners have experienced. As for the lens, I find that the price I paid for the camera kit is well worth the price. I don't think I would have bought the kit for anything above 399.99 with tax.As for the camera, I feel that it is targeted to photography enthusiasts with an appreciation for style and quality being foremost and picture quality second. Of course, being a MFT camera, I would not expect it to compare with my APS-C Sensor DSLR (the close to ten year old D200 by Nikon) but I believe the GX-1's sensor was mature enough to surpass the old APS-C sensor. In fact, I thought the low light performance was much less noisy than the old Nikon I have (with 70-200mm 2.8 VR and 12-24mm 4.0 DX lenses). Additionally, putting the two cameras side by side is like day and night. The D200 is at least 3x as large as the GX-1 and that's where the MFT format's value comes in. Superb IQ and small form factor. You can't ask for anything more.I have a fledging MFT lens collection now with the 14-42mm powerzoom, 7-14mm ultrawide angle lens by Panasonic and 30mm 2.8 prime and 19mm 2.8 prime by SIGMA. I am currently looking for a telephoto zoom to complete my collection but most of the telephoto MFT lenses on offer eschews the advantage of portability of the format so I haven't taken the plunge. I suppose I have somewhat been drawn in by the MFT addiction I read about in many photography forums and I can say that the GX-1 is the best price/performance product currently on the market at the price that I had paid.

I wanted to go light. I own or have owned, Nikons, Canons and Olympus cameras. I am not a \"fanboy\" of any particular brand but look for equipment that fulfills a purpose. That said, here are my impressions after a week of use and about 500 pictures. I shot under different environments: at home, pictures of the cats and people with and without flash; early morning shooting at the botanical gardens shooting landscapes and flowers and the dawn; shooting at a local beach capturing bay views, downtown skyline, parasailing and boating. I also shot some of the same scenes using my Olympus XZ1 for comparison, a high end point and shoot that shoots RAW. The Olympus has a 10 megapixels sensor that is about 1/4 of the size of the GX1 sensor (16 megapixels).The Good:-very good to excellent RAW images-good to very good JPEG output from the camera-Autofocus was fast and reliable in full daylight-Relatively easy to use buttons for access to major functions (ISO, WB, Focus, etc)-Burst shooting great for action (parasailing)-Video was high quality and easy to use with instant access buttonThe Bad:-Autofocus was not relaiable or at times not functional under low light (early morning)-LCD virtually useless in bright daylight. You MUST purchase EVF for regular outdoor use or you will be frustrated. I shoot regularly with my XZ1 which has an OLED screen and I have no difficulty with it.-I dislike the touchscreen. It is finicky and not always responsive. Moreover, putting fingerprints all over the screen you are using to view and frame a picture seems counterintuitive.-Two of the programmable \"buttons\" are on the touchscreen (see above)so they are less than useful and not full featured.I was disappointed in the performance of the camera. In comparing the photos from the GX1 and the XZ1, the GX1 were better (less noise) but not sooooo much better that it was worth the price difference. This is decidely a significant step up from point and shoot shooting but it is also a significant step down from a DSLR. I returned the camera.

I bought the 20mm pancake lens with it (opted out of the kit lens as people said it was meh).  BEAUTIFUL photos.  Wow!  I use it to take pics of cosplay and my crafts.  (Google 'lithe-fider' with 'cosplay' or 'creatures' if you want to see.)  People have been really impressed with pics from this camera so far.  People are surprised to hear it's a Lumix like I think most people just buy Canon Rebels and never look at anything else.  I wanted this camera cause it is smaller then other DSLRs, and with the 20mm on it it looks downright tiny in comparison!  Easily fits in my purse.  Feels quality though....like it weighs then same as my friend's bigger canon cause it feels more 'metal-y' and less 'plastic-y'.  I love the grip on this camera, I regret nothing in buying it.Has like a million functions and I'm only beginning to learn them all.  Some of the onscreen quick menu things are confusing, so many things! Takes gorgeous HD video.  Sadly the 20mm doesn't have Image Stabilization, also it is slowww on the continuous AF.  Get a 14-45mm lens or 14-42mm for videotaping if you want that too.  The 20mm does great in low light, also the camera does well on higher iso's with minor grain (like up to 1600 is totally fine, but I usually don't have to go that high with the low F-stop on the 20mm, and I am not even using a tripod cause I have steady hands).  I like using it on manual...I press the 'best setting' button which picks what it thinks is the best F-stop and shutter speed, then I tweak from there.  Auto mode is great in good light.  It's good to quickly use if you are in a hurry.I also have a little 4/3 Olympus 14-42mm lens which works just fine with it.  AF is FAST.  I'm looking into getting a Panasonic lens with the O.I.S.

After the small bar finished flashing ( I think the processing is over) so I tried to delete a picture, it actually worked!

I cannot let the camera on for that long just to delete one single picture! Deleting a picture should be the most basic function a camera provides, and it shouldn't take such a long time!

Please don't tell me to get an empty SD card because the camera still needs to process all the new photos just taken. \u3000Does this happen to everyone else or it's just this camera, apparently with a quality issue?

I can spend half a day with the 7D+17-40L, or 2-3 hours when you add the 580ex flash. I hold the camera with the index and a second or third finger to carry and will only use the thumb for shooting. This small camera, like almost all small bodies, doesn't allow one to hold it without using the thumb, balanced in two fingers. this comment it's not meant for the general everyday casual user, because you will just hang it on your neck and its done. But if you like to carry it by your side, ready to use, always on, like me, you will finish the day with a painful thumb. I sold the camera and got a canon PS SX50HS.

Image quality:I have a D40 where 99% of the pictures taken look gorgeous even with kit lens. With Panasonic GX1 and kit lens, 80% of pictures taken look just bad. Kit lens is too slow. At low ISO, indoor pictures always look shaky, maybe the clunkier than usual shutter has something to do with it. At ISO 800 or above, pictures look grainy. It does take some good pictures in bright light. Though sometimes even in good light the focus is not sharp.

With kit lens it feels heavy for such a tenuous grip. The camera body gets hot after being used for more than 15 minutes, I've never seen any other camera do that.

The G3 is built much better. Image quality is virtually the same as the G3 with nothing new here in the GX1.

The G3 has a fully articulated screen and built-in EVF for $100 less including kit lens. The G3 has the annoying touch screen also, but the awesome part is that you can move it out of the way or leave it closed to use the EVF.GX1 seems like a marketing scheme aimed at GF1 owners since they messed up the GF2 last year. Panasonic makes great lenses, but has dropped the ball on the GX1 body. They missed fired on their product line up and with Olympus in trouble, this is not good for the MFT format.The GX1 is made in Japan and the G3 is made in China.
