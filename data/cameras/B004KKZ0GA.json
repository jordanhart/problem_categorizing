I'll assume that the price is dropping (dropped) on this because of the screen interface.  And it *does* take a little getting used to, and with my large fingers, it's not always the easiest thing to do.That said, the price for a camera like this is right, and the photos are outstanding.  You'll get used to the interface.  You'll love the price.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "A camcorder that takes pics", "Author": "J. Capobianco", "ReviewID": "R3M46NZ59OR95K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I suppose that I understand why Panasonic had to make this camera. With everyone using iphones, the touchscreen Ideaseems to make sense. I bought a new display model from Mike's camera on Ebay for $39! so I couldn't wait to try it out against my Zs5 and fx500.  I have to start by saying that I hate holding this camera(there is nothing to grip)glass on the back and smooth plastic on the front. The battery door is the most fragile I have ever seen on any camera, be careful. I examined the pics and video and here is what I found; there is not a uniform image, 3/4 of the way across the image there are soft spots, but the edges and center are fine?? at 120mm it is a bit soft(just like the fx500)they share a similar lens design. The lens also has a flair issue, the coatings and quality control are not up to Leica's high standard. The ZS5 is in another league and much sharper. Video is this little guy's shining spot, videos are smooth, Hi res, and you can zoom during filming. Video is the only reason I am keeping it, the LCD user interface, image and built quality are not for serious shooters. This shouldn't be in their FX line, it just doesn't meet that quality standard.Update-sold this camera. I really couldn't take the poor picture performance, most cell phones do better. Battery life was also terrible.Won't miss it. Got $65 for it, paid $39.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch screen.
