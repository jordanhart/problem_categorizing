(also it does not have to be mounted on the phone to work, just as long as it is connected with the wifi, so tri pod stand comes in use here.)the NFC sensor on the camera is on the top of it, next to the power button, works really well with most android phones that supports NFC. (it's NOT a sony phones only device)sometimes it's not explain that well but this product comes without a battery charger, but you do get a USB cable so you can hook the QX10 up to a computer when the camera is powered off. then it will charge the battery. if you order the QX10 only (not bundle like this) you won't get a microSD card needed to take photos. a 64gb microSD card will be able to hold about 9700 photos so you will most likely not need a microSD over 16gb to the QX10.hope this help some of you.ps: also important to have some kind of case to store the QX10 cam in when not in use to avoid accidents (damage to the unit)sorry about some spelling errors... im not english speaking normally.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3M26OALXTLWLO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera take great pictures (vivid colors + good quality under low light conditions).
