The most interesting new feature is the smile-detection mode. With that mode on, the shutter doesn't open until the face recognition technology senses that the subject is smiling!One criticism: It has no lens cover, so the lens can easily get dirty and/or broken.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera.", "Author": "Mulvina L Goodwll", "ReviewID": "R2C2MRE65GZPIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have taken many pictures with this camera. Transferred them to my desktop, and emailed some. The quality of the pictures and the ease of use are fantastic. I had someone with no camera experience take pictures with it .

Great camera,.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Like this camera", "Author": "Brittney Sharrow \"BKLSharrow\"", "ReviewID": "R1P6XAWTC0DS1Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera just to carry around and take snap shots of you and your friends. Easy to use. The only down fall is that some pictures do come out a little blurry but other than that it is a great camera.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "lousy photos", "Author": "James Hauser", "ReviewID": "R1PDQNCHKSC3IJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I know this is a cheap camera, but I expected at least usable photos. I am not looking for high quality, crystal clear photos. I have a dslr for that. I was just hoping for pictures that weren't blurry or super grainy. You have to hold the camera completely steady to get any kind of viewable photo. Even then, in well lit indoor settings, it is very grainy. I think this is simply a penhole camera put inside an oversized plastic case, so they could call it a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "no star review", "Author": "Charles D.

Totally not worth paying for. Even with the camera and subject perfectly still, the image is off color, with poor contrast. With even a twitch of movement, the picture literally looks like some sort of apparition photo. Comppetely 100% useless photos. I gave it to my five year old to take pictures of her Barbies with, went to the store and bought a decent camera for seventy bucks. I don't blame the seller, they post reviews which reflect the true quality of the camera. I just didn't heed the warnings. That is the sole reason I did not send it back. Should have known better.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Bad Quality", "Author": "Kristie", "ReviewID": "R3F551YPMW6A54", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This \"camera\" is maybe worth $10, at the most.  Even with flash on, the pictures turn out blurry unless you hold the camera completely still, and even then the pictures are very low-quality.  I can't even imagine how bad they must look on a large computer screen.  I wouldn't know because I returned it right away.  It's amazing they're able to market this as a \"digital camera\" because I can take better photos using a cell phone.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad gift", "Author": "gift for a friend", "ReviewID": "RBLLQLTCJMNDQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera for a friend for a birthday gift and it is not working, it will take 2 tto 3 picture and will not take any more picture after that.How can my friend get a new camera that will work.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$49.99", "Features": "12.1MP with a 2.7-inch preview screen\nPic Bridge ready with SD card support\n4x Digital zoom, face and smile detection, red eye reduction and ant shake features\nCan also be used to take video clips", "Name": "Vivitar 12.1MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch Screen (VT027-RH)", "ImgURL": "http://218.201.42.40:8080/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f8uahIoWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ODOD2G"}}
