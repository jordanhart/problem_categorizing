Jaeckle", "ReviewID": "R373RIDHVA9CAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a beautifully built precision instrument, loaded with features and offering a range of controls.  It requires more study and practice than I anticipated, and isn't merely point-and-click even in its simplest mode.  Its default sensitivity to light is for a smaller range than I was used to with my previous digital camera.  So far, indoor photos fade into dark when they should have more of an illuminated background.  Back-lighting also has been difficult to compensate for, although the features to do so are allegedly built in.  As simple as it looks to operate, this camera does require hours of getting used to, in order to take advantage of all the features, and to get the results you want and should be able to expect.  This camera is for the devoted, experimental photographer, or someone who likes to master complexities.  A Lumix is not for a lummox...", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Mr. Richard J. Harper Jr.", "ReviewID": "R14RY0JLG4PBDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera. It has so many features for it's size, love the photos it takes and the 22 minute very clear videos also. I put a 4 gig card in mine and I can take 689 photos at a full 12 meg. Every one says that you need a spare battery, that's just a sales pitch, I can take over 300 photos with one charge. If you take a lot of photos a spare would be nice, Amazon offers the spare battery with a Case for only $25. Great bargin and deal at that price. I just ordered mine.  Get this camera, you won't regret it.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good little camera", "Author": "A.

The camera has no viewfinder making it very difficult to frame shots under bright conditions.If I had realized there was no viewfinder, I would not have purchased this camera.If you don't mind not having a viewfinder, the camera is top notch.", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000RN4PKG"}}
