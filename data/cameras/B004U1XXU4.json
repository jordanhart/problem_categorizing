I am not able to use it because it came from another seller and has parts missing. The product is advertised as a wireless system however when I received it today it was missing parts.  I just complained to amazon and will see what happens. Otherwise I will have it returned and order a similar item from X-10. (Maybe I should have done that to begin with). I have not experienced this type of problem with Amazon so I will give them a change to reply before I make a final decision.  I will be writing a NEW review if thing works out. My wife and I are disabled and was hoping to save a few bucks. Just not as advertised. The external quality of this item is questionable. Do not know if works.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004U1XXU4"}}
