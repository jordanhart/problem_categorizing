It does not distort or interfere with viewing the LCD, and is hard enough that the LCD is truly protected.  It snaps on securely and does not come off.  The only small \"problem\" I have encountered is that when swiveling the viewer when the camera is mounted on a tripod, the protector makes for a tight squeeze opening and closing the viewer.  It doesn't make doing so impossible, just tight.  At all other times, this is not a problem at all.  This type of protector is much to be preferred to the static-clinging ones that go directly onto the screen -- this one leaves a small gap between protector and LCD screen so there is no danger of scratching or bumping.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Shiba-Neko", "ReviewID": "R2Y53GH75LIIKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was thinking to buy film but I got this one instead.

One thing I don't like is after the protective film is removed you may easily scratch it while cleaning off finger prints and smudges with tissues or lens cleaning papers. The mini scratches do not seem to mar the view of the LCD screen however. You also must remove the protector to turn around and close the LCD against the camera body.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "Coronet Blue", "ReviewID": "R3SVEO6FJDC1OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cover is clear and good quality, similar to the snap-on LCD covers on Nikon SLRs.  Two things you should know.  There are two ways to orient this cover before snapping it into place.  One is a little more secure than the other because it makes use of two indentations in the camera.  It's hard to explain but you'll see what I mean.  The other thing to know is that with this cover in place, you can't store the LCD facing inwards, flush with the back of the camera.  Then again, if that's what you want to do, you don't need this cover in the first place.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007UN3L3I"}}
