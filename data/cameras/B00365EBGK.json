I was very pleased with the performance of this camera. I did some side by side tests with my top notch Panasonic FZ35 bridge camera. Considering the FZ35 is a 10 in all comparisons, here are my thoughts on this HP360. Pictures are about an 8, lack a touch of saturation but can be tweaked in Picasa 3. The clarity of the pictures are a 9, very nice. The video is good and gets a 8 as nothing comes close to the FZ35 HD video but this cameras video is very good and has good sound and color. Focuses fairly quickly when zooming video. The features on this camera are extensive and work well such as smile detection. This camera suffers, as all inexpensive cameras do, in the area of low light without flash, very noisy but flash pictures are OK. This is meant to be a fun camera for spur of the moment shots, not for once in a lifetime shots. The touchscreen clears away a lot of button clutter and allows for a big bright clear 3\" LCD screen. The menus are easy and laid out well within the touchscreen.

You have to guess if the image you shoot is the one you want. I was outdoors shooting exhibitions and competitions and, because I was in the bright sun, I had to guess if what I was pointing the camera at was what I wanted to see; in about a quarter of the images I preserved, I was disappointed. I guess the only was to avoid that kind of problem is to get an SLR camera, or at least one with an optional viewfinder.

If you plan on zooming in long ways, look for a camera with a bigger lens.Pros\"  easy to use  really decent photos for point and shoot  fits nicely in pocket, shirt or pants  videos look good  easy navigation and quick changes with touch screenCons\"  Battery life is bad with stck battery  Bright sun makes screen almost impossible to see  No view finder, only the screen to use..making sun a killerI have no problem giving this camera my blessing, but do yourself a favor and get a DIGIPOWER 720ma battery Item BP-KD7001..it lasts a lot longer and fits the camera.  DO NOT BUY a battery larger that 720ma..it will not fit the camera.

It's price makes it worth the risk of losing it and the features are terrific, once you figure them out.  That is the only drawback.  The instructions that come with the camera are .... well minimal is an overstatement.  You are forced to use the CD (provided) loaded into your computer to get off the ground.  (I don't often carry my computer with me when on an outing that will use this camera.)  Once you've learned enuf so that some settings become intuitive, the camera does a good job for the price.loner", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "BETTER THAN EXPECTED", "Author": "J.

It handles beautifully, the pictures are great. The touch screen makes it so easy and quick to navigate, far quicker than the usual rocker button. I also like that I can zoom while making a video, though it seems to stop recording briefly while it zooms. The only complaint I have, and it's minor, is that the slideshow switches pictures too quickly and there seems to be no way to adjust the slide show speed. One more complaint is when I review the pictures, there are options at the bottom that obscure 1/3 of the picture while I click from pic to pic and I can't get that to disappear--again, minor.Overall I am extemely pleased, especially at the price and value", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lots of Features - Easy to Use!", "Author": "Donald Bishop", "ReviewID": "R3PR0Z4FP8WLL6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a camera that was small and thin for ease of carrying, a good number of features yet simple to operate, and produced great looking pictures. The HP PB360 ended up covering all of my requirements. I have it now for over a month, and I have used it during two trips. It is super simple to use. It has a lot of advanced functions available if you need them, which you access via the 3 inch touch-screen menu. The LCD display is far better than I expected. The camera is so thin that it allows for very easy stow and carry in most anything, including a shirt pocket! One of the neat features I like is that I can tell it what size/resolution to take the picture in, and one of the options is \"HD\" mode, where it takes a picture in 1920x1080, which matches my HD computer monitor. Comes in handy when you want to take a shot to use as your desktop background, without having to import the pic into a graphics program to resize it to fit the monitor. It has many other resolutions, megapixels, and quality levels you can pick from quickly and easily.If you want a digital camera that is loaded with features, but you want to keep it simple and have the stuff out of the way until you need them, then I can highly recommend the HP PB360.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP 12 MP Touchscreen Camera", "Author": "Fabio Moises", "ReviewID": "R1ZXH8ZPUTT5F6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product looks very nice.

You can take a lot of pictures on a full charge, but if the camera sits for a bit it has absolutely no juice when you go back to it, and it powers off after a few minutes of not being used so it's not like it should drain all the power.Charging the battery is a pain. You have to take the battery out, which isn't a big deal, but the charger is a nightmare. You really have to fuss with it to position it just right to get a charge.Also, you'd think that it would charge from your computer while it's hooked up via the USB cable, but it doesn't.There is NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL with this camera either. If you want to know how to use all the features that come with this model you have to go to the HP website and dig through 64 pages of online info to get anywhere.I do like the voice note recording option though.I only paid $89 for this 12mp camera on a lightning deal, so I guess I can't expect too much.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "dissapointed", "Author": "s.levin", "ReviewID": "R185SMCIPZZ60", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hi just bought this camera to take with us on our trip to Mexico...It takes good pictures but it really has a bad  battery life .I was very disappointed going back to my old camera hp should stick to computers", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "malfunctioning power button", "Author": "Lauren John \"beetroot\"", "ReviewID": "RMRZ68J6Y3RCY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the camera is not so wholesome, the power button started to malfunction as soon as I started to use it.
