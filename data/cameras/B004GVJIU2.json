I use these cameras in crawl spaces of houses and other dirty environments so I buy cheap and throw away about 4-5 each year after they are ruined by dirt and water.  I have had 1 megapixel cameras take better photos.  The flash is very slow to recover.  View scree is dim and very difficult to see outdoors.  If you want cheap and disposable as I need for my work, it is a good buy.  Otherwise buy another brand.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Gift", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R24RTXDDETRYCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for a friend.

I'm not disappointed, but I'm not jumping for joy either. Also, it doesn't really come with instructions, so you will have to download them online.

I bought this camera because years ago I had a Vivitar camera. That camera had less than half of the mega pixels that this camera (supposedly) has. The pictures are washed out if you use the flash no matter what, the video is HORRIBLY grainy! My last vivitar camera with half the mega pixels had WAY better video and picture quality. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU LIKE QUALITY VIDEO'S AND PICTURES!!!", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7.1 Megapixel CCD\n4x Digital Zoom\n1.8\" LCD Screen\nAntiShake Technology\nHD Video Mode", "Name": "ViviCam 7022 7.1 Megapixel Compact Camera-7.45 mm - Graphite", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21L89wzk1%2BL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004GVJIU2"}}
