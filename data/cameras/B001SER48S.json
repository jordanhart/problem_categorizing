{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great little cam, some improvements from earlier powershots, some quirks", "Author": "Omar Siddique", "ReviewID": "R77J9I1HPXLET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The SD1200 has some big changes over its predecessor SD1100, and is the smallest, best designed Elph I've used thus far.I've owned many models of Elph, this is my 6th or 7th, so my review is aimed especially at other serial Canon owners.  I mostly compare the SD1200 to the SD1100.* The big changes: Digic4 and a larger CCD sensor.  The slight increase in CCD size (1/2.3\" vs 1/2.5\") should make for \"cleaner\" photos.  And Digic4 promises faster/cleaner shots also.* You get 10MP vs 8MP on the SD1100, and \"medium\" (M1) size is now 6MP.  JPG quality is down to 2 setting: Fine or Normal.* SD1200 is only slightly smaller than the SD1100, but feels notably smaller by virtue of curved edges and the LCD being flush with the body (no bump-out).* The 1200 now feels as small as this design can shrink.  Good news: my average-sized male hands can still comfortably hold it, barely not covering lens, flash, or resting on the LCD.  But the round power-button is now almost too small to press if you had big fingers and no fingernails.* 1200's new battery is a higher capacity 1000mAh (vs ~760mAh for SD1100).  There's also a new charger (not compatible with the old batteries), a glossy white-colored model to blend into your wall.* The buttons and menus are streamlined. There's now a button for review mode, pressing it a 2nd time takes you back to the previous state.  Handy.  The slider has  dedicated AUTO and Manual settings, no longer need to use menus for that switch.* Continuous mode and ISO now are in the Function Menu (on the SD1100, they had dedicated buttons).* A SD card is no longer included.  This makes sense to me, a 32MB card is barely useful, and with the downward pressure on electronics prices, I can't imagine Canon wanting to bundle a more expensive/bigger card.  Some people will find this lack annoying.* The A/V output is gone, and the USB connector now serves both purposes (both kinds of included cables now have a USB-end)* A new version of Canon software is required for this model, Zoombrowser 6.3.  Canon typically requires a new release for each new family/season of cameras.  Unfortunately, the CameraWindow software has been intentionally dumbed-down in the 6.x software and no longer offers the options to delete your photos (have to go through the OS), nor to chose custom naming for the downloads.  I say intentionally, since I asked Canon customer-support about it and they stated the changes were not bugs.  The last Canon software to still have that functionality was 5.x, corresponding to the SD1000 and other cameras released that season.* In casual indoor tests, the 1200 seemed more ready to go to ISO400 (often too \"noisy\" to be useful) when the SD1100 would have chosen ISO200.* The SD1200 and SD1100 have identical specs on their optics.  However, I noticed a more pronounced barrel-distortion on the 1200 at extreme wide-angle. (still only noticable in close-up shots of straight-edged items at wide-angle)* In a casual speed test, the SD1200 took/stored photos notably faster the SD1100 (same scene, continuous-mode, same brand SD card), despite the 1200's image size being larger.* Canon's paper manuals have been shrinking steadily.  With this model, the only manual included is a quick-start guide, the rest is on CD-ROM.* The packaging is even more efficient than before, about half the size of the SD1100's box.* Sadly, there is no HD video mode, although all of the other Elphs released this spring had HD.  SD1200 owners are stuck with 640x480 video.Canon has several sub-series within the compact Elph line, varying mostly by asthetics and optics. The SD1200 is successor to the series that included the SD1100, SD1000, and SD600.  These all favor a classic, slim design. If you're unfamiliar with Canon's Powershot cameras, there's lots of good material out there on camera sites such as dpreview.In general, the small sensors and optics in all ultra-compact digital cameras lead to some optical quirks (such as barrelling), chromatic aberrations, over/under-exposure in bright sunlight/shade, and underpowered flashes.  That's intrinsic to the size of camera, and vendors try to correct these effects in their on-board processing.  My opinion is that Canon does a good job of correcting for these issues and the Elphs including the SD1200 take very good photos for their size.It's questionable that a SD1100 owner would specifically find this a compelling upgrade other than the Digic4, but this is an excellent compact camera in all ways. Apart from the noteworthy quirks: the lack of HD and the limited features in the download software, this camera is Highly Recommended.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hated it at first, but now we get along just fine!", "Author": "Sophster", "ReviewID": "R3RIAL4KVZ1S3B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't typically bother reviewing products because I usually only buy things that already have a lot of reviews.  I decided to throw in my 2 cents on this one in hopes someone can benefit from my experience. I primarily use my camera for family shots, mostly of my young children.  I loved my old Canon A610 more that I can say and it has served me well for 4 years.  Recently one of my children got a hold of it and bent up the little dealies that close over the lens cap to the point where I had to pull them off with tweezers just to use the camera.  That's when I decided it was time to see what Canon now has to offer.  I am by no means a photography expert.  I just want a point and shoot that I can use to snap high quality family photos for prints, digital scrapbooks, etc.The sale price on this camera seemed excellent for the features and a free memory card offer sucked me in so I took the plunge.  I assumed it would be a major upgrade from my 5MP A610. Once I had the battery charged up I started taking photos of my kids in auto mode.  I was *shocked* at the poor quality of the photos.  Every photo I reviewed was terrible.  Many were blurry, and the ones that weren't couldn't be cropped to the slightest degree without losing all detail.  I couldn't believe it!  Auto mode on my old Canon had never failed me before and I could crop all the way to the eyeballs without loss of detail.  Determined not to give up, I did some research.  Several people recommended \"kids and pets\" mode.  I tried this and the blurry issue was solved. However, the cropping issue still remained.  I dug deeper and started messing with ISO settings and a bunch of other stuff I don't really understand.  I just couldn't solve the problem.  I even got out my old Canon and took identical shots with both cameras and the old one won out every single time.  I must point out that these were all indoor shots with relatively low light.  I realize these are not ideal conditions, but if a camera can't handle those conditions then it isn't for me.I had pretty much resolved to return this camera and was already shopping on Amazon for another one when I decided to give it one more try.  I simply couldn't understand how this camera could perform so poorly.  I fired it back up in \"kids and pets\" mode and started looking around at all the settings it would let me modify.  That's when I noticed an \"S\" in the bottom left corner of the screen.  Hmmm...what could this be? The other options for this setting are L M1 M2 M3 S and W.  It turns out that this setting determines the number of megapixels that the camera uses.  L is the highest resolution setting which uses all 10MP and 3648x2736 resolution.  S (which is what the camera was automatically set to) has a resolution of only 640x480 and appears to use .3MP.  Soooo, I bumped it from S up to L and now my camera takes awesome photos.  Once again I can crop to the eyeballs and now side by side the same photos look even better on the new camera than they did on my old one.  Also, with my 4GB memory card it says I can take approximately 1450 photos at this higher resolution.  So now all is right with the world, I don't have to deal with the hassle of a return, and I can take awesome family photos this Christmas.Even though the camera is performing admirably now, I had to give it 4 stars because it should not have been such a pain in the rear to straighten this out. Not to mention that the included paper manual does not even address this issue at all.  I assume the online manual covers it, but should I really have to go that far to get one croppable indoor shot?  This is a point and shoot!!  Most of the bad reviews were for the same problem I was having.  The majority of purchasers don't want to have to switch a bunch of settings; they just want the camera to take great photos without a lot of effort.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Professional photographers review", "Author": "S.

I got tired of dragging my D3,D200 or other large cameras around, and worrying about it getting damaged. I decided to buy a camera just for fun that could fit in my purse and I wouldn't have a heart attack if it broke. Well I didn't hold that high of expectations of the camera, but after getting it, I've had a lot of fun with it. Not the most amazing pictures come from it (I am used to very high quality pictures), but they are good enough shots of my family. It's easy to use, really easy to set, FAST, and good low light. You don't always need the flash. It's very small, and can fit easily in my purse (that are all quiet small purses actually). This is a perfect camera if you just want some fun shots that are clear, and you want an easy to use fast camera. This is NOT good for \"professional\" type shots (why do people write reviews of these cameras and get all down on them for not being professional grade cameras? They never claim to be!).", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "As compared to the SD110", "Author": "Sidney G. Mcdaniel", "ReviewID": "R29MO4D9ER3V0A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the SD110 (3.2MP) back in 2004 and decided it was time to upgrade this year as it was showing some age.  The latest version of that same line is the SD1200.  I have had it for a few weeks now and have a few observations.  The SD1200 is much faster from the time you turn it on until it is ready to shoot as compared to the SD110.  Next, the screen is far better than the one on the SD110.  Very bright and readable even in sunlight.  The camera itself is smaller than the SD110 as you might expect but does feel a little cheaper.  So far I have taken the SD1200 to three main events.  A birthday party, K-4 graduation, backyard play time.  The birthday part pictures did not turn out well in automatic mode.  We were indoors (Pump-it-up) and the lighting was probably not the best.  The images were blurry for the most part.  I had the same issue at the second event (K-4 graduation) but this time I switched to manual mode and used the \"indoor\" setting.  This greatly improved the picture.  Finally, the outdoor shots turned out looking wonderful in automatic mode.  With the SD110 the automatic mode was always better than any of the manual settings.  It seems with the SD1200 that is not the case.  I will continue to explore the settings/features of the camera.  I was expecting the SD1200 to be far superior to my 5 year old SD110 but so far the pictures themselves have not turned out markedly better.", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review of Cannon SD1200IS", "Author": "Timothy Brown", "ReviewID": "R3NC0FL9642ER2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow!  This is the 3rd Cannon Elph camera that I have owned.  Cannon hit a home run with this one.  I can't seem to take a bad picture with this camera.  I use it for work and take pictures all day long under different situations.  Everything operates on automatic, the camera even switches automatically between long distance and macro modes.  It is able to produce great pictures in different lighting situations, where my others cameras have failed in the past.This is about my 25th digital camera that I have purchased, we actually wear them out through use, and I will purchase this same camera again, and highly recommend it to you.  You will be satisfied.  The only negative that I can say is that the camera is almost too small for my large hands and the camera disappears in your pockets and you will forget that you are carrying it!  Really, that is not a problem, and actually probably a plus if you are on vacation and don't want to be lugging around some big war club old camera to take some pics.I can't recommend this camera more.

Snellgrove", "ReviewID": "RMEL4JNXX1CCJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera because my son is nearly 2 and I'd noticed that my photo taking had dramatically dropped off.  He'd be doing something adorable and I'd run to get the camera and by the time I got back he'd be five activities past whatever he'd been doing.I needed a Dad camera - one that was small enough to carry with me all the time, started up fast, had good image stabilization and face detection, decent zoom and flash, was 100% automatic (no tweaking with portrait mode vs. sunny day mode vs. contrast settings while my son was peddling his tricycle for the first time), and was cheap enough that I wouldn't mind dropping it occasionally.The Cannon SD1200IS is that camera.  It's been a joy to use.  I got the grey leather Cannon case to go with it and I now carry it everywhere.  Looks a bit geeky (with the case it's about the size of a blackberry) but I've caught tons spontaneous shots that would have vanished in the time it would take to get a larger camera.  I agree with other posters - the battery and USB covers are a bit flakey - but the rest of the camera is solid.  I've dropped it from waist height twice now with no issues.A couple unexpected benefits:1) My son now loves taking pictures himself (I hold the camera - he aims and pushes the button) - and the auto focus works well enough that some of his shots come out pretty well.  It's neat to see what's important enough in his world to take a photo of (mostly toy trains and cars these days) and he's very proud of his own pictures.2) I didn't know it when I purchased but the SD1200IS has a built in accelerometer so Picasa now auto-rotates all my imported photos - 15 minutes of time magically recovered from each week!Highly, highly recommended ;-D", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Good Ultra-Small Camera at a Good Price", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R1Q1FRQLARUDHC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon SD1200 is a good ultra-small camera at the current price of around $150.  For people planning to spend $200, there may be better choices from both Canon and Panasonic.The materials and workmanship on the Canon SD1200 look cheaper than on my older Canon SD1000.  The SD1000 looked like a very expensive camera, and the SD1200, up close, looks cheaply made.  Looks don't always predict durability...judging by customer comments, it is likely that the two models are about equally reliable.As with most small Canon cameras, photos taken in the \"auto\" mode are likely to be adequate, but seldom exceptional in quality.  To get the best results with the SD1200, the owners should spend a couple of hours practicing setting exposure levels, ISO levels, and adjusting white balance, contrast, saturation, and sharpness.  For most outdoor photos on a sunny day, the best results will come from \"locking\" the ISO at 100, dropping exposure 1/3 stop, decreasing contrast to the minimum, and increasing sharpness.With practice, you can change exposure levels or ISO levels in less than five seconds.  If a photo looks too bright or too dark, you can simply retake the photo with the exposure level adjusted for the best results.  The tiny flash of the SD1200 works best if you \"lock\" the ISO at 200, and stay three feet to six feet from your primary subject.  If you take a flash photo of a group of people sitting twenty feet away, you are likely to get poor results.Read the complete owners manual, and work through all of the settings page by page.  Many folks have, by accident, set their camera for macro focus and are surprised all of their photos are now blurry, or set the camera in a mode that takes tiny one meg sized photos, and are surprised by the photos not being sharp and detailed.  A less than excellent photo with this camera will be the result of a mistake by the owner about 99 times out of a hundred.The folks who complain about not getting sharp photos simply need to practice.  To get sharp photos, you should press the shutter down halfway to lock the focus and exposure, hold the camera steady with both hands, and gently push down on the shutter.  With practice, most people can get very sharp photos outdoors at shutter speeds as low as 1/15th of a second.  The folks who hold their camera with one hand and fail to pre-focus will seldom get sharp photos with ANY small digital camera.Although the SD1200 will fit into your jeans pocket, it belongs in a padded case.  In your pocket, sooner or later you will damage the lens mechanism, and the lens will refuse to open or close.  Or you will damage the viewing screen.  Keeping the camera in a padded case in your bag or clipped to your built ensures many years of reliable service...and don't forget...never leave a digital camera inside a parked car...the 120 degree summer temperatues will fry its brain.", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Blurry images", "Author": "Jeff Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R3EAGJS04YBS17", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been buying Canon Powershots for years: SD400, SD600, SD1100 (purchased in 2008) and have greatly enjoyed their portability and excellent, sharp images.

Keele", "ReviewID": "R5P60OUWB33HC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am typically the BIGGEST fan of these Canon ELPH cameras.  I owned the SD450 and still do have the SD1000.  The SD450 was a victim of being tossed around in luggage, so when that broke, I went with the SD1000 and was very happy.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the square nature of the SD1000, but loved the camera otherwise and soon forgot about its boxy frame.  I have an 11 month old daughter and decided to get a second camera that way my husband could take the SD1000 and I would have the SD1200IS (in orange, of course) at my side all of the time to snap pictures of the baby.  I could not have been more excited to receive my camera and was instantly disappointed.  The sturdy feel that was found with the SD1000 had disappeared to a cheap, plastic feel.  The battery cover door is flimsy and feels like it could pop open at anytime.  However, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and promptly popped the battery in to snap a few pictures to test it out.  Indoor pictures are terrible.  The AUTO position on the camera is a complete joke.  I think it's safe to say that 75% of those pictures were unusable and the remaining 25% were definitely not GOOD.  After messing around with the settings a little (I'm not a camera pro, but I do know a few things about the ISO settings and such), I was able to improve the percentage of good to horrible pictures to probably 50%/50%.  However, I still was lacking crisp, clear photos.  After checking the photos and completely missing out on some AWESOME pictures that actually had my daughter looking at the camera because they were completely fuzzy, I have decided to pack it up and send it back.  The video is not HD, but neither was the SD450 or SD1000, and I think that the SD1200's is inferior.  I cannot express how disappointed I am that Canon has released such a subpar offering.  I paid just under $170 for this camera and am wondering if I would have a different response with the SD780 or SD940, but then will have to shell out at least another $100 for it.  We paid $150 for the SD1000 and I almost got 2 of that model.  I now wish that I had.  The SD1000 is a 7.1 MP and the 1200IS is 10 MP.  Honestly, I feel like I got pictures with my 2MP Fuji Finepix that I had 8 years ago.I'm sorry to do this to you, Canon - I've been such a supporter and have recommended your cameras to more than a handful of friends/family members.  I'm going to have to rethink my camera situation.  I was blown away from the good reviews - but whenever something negative was said about this model - it did say there were a lot of blurry pictures.  Perhaps if I haven't been so wow'ed in the past by other SD ELPH models, I may not have not had such a horrible review.

Unfortunately Canon's Smart Auto mode is HORRIBLE.  It constantly looks for the \"proper\" scene mode and it usually chooses the wrong mode.  I'll never understand the logic they used for this mode, it is completely wrong.The SD1200 is not the only Canon compact that suffers from this problem, just about every new Canon has the same problem.  The Smart Auto mode is absurd!  For example, when shooting indoors in average lighting Smart Auto will frequently pick a very high ISO value, a low shutter, and it will sometimes even turn the flash off!  The low shutter will result in blurry pics because of camera shake, the high ISO value will result in grainy/noisy pics.  A Full Auto Mode (a mode designed for beginners) should NEVER allow the shutter speed to drop below 1/60 of a second.Fortunately there is an easy solution.  Take the camera out of Full Auto (Smart Auto) mode and put it in Programmed Auto Exposure Mode (Page 62 of the manual).  This mode is set by sliding the mode switch on the back to the middle position, and then make sure the exposure mode is set to \"P\" (Program mode on, scene modes off).  Set the camera as follows:* Exposure Mode \"P\" (Page 62)* Make sure the Auto flash feature is on (Page 62, A-Lightning Bolt).* Make sure the Auto ISO feature is on (Page 68).* Focus mode should be the normal setting (not macro, not landscape, Page 63)* Exposure Compensation should be 0 (Page 67)* Image Quality should be set to Large, Compression set to Fine (both on Page 65).* White balance should be Auto (Page 69).* Set the IS mode to Continuous (Page 113).* Metering Mode should be Evaluative (Page 79)These base settings will result in great point and shoot pictures.  The shutter will never drop below 1/60, the flash will turn on when the light level drops, and your pictures will be sharp and well exposed.  When you become more familiar with the camera you can turn off some of the auto settings and try to be more creative.The bottom line is the camera is terrible in Fully Auto (Smart Auto) mode, and it is excellent in Programmed Auto Exposure mode.  This is probably not the camera for someone who needs something that works great in a Fully Auto \"Dummy\" mode.  I don't think any of the recent Canon compacts fit that bill, they all have the terrible Smart Auto Mode.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed - not as good as the SD1100", "Author": "Kathy S. \"Kathy S.\"", "ReviewID": "R1U168MAO2IVQY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After seeing many surprisingly crisp clean results taken by my friend's Canon SD1100, I decided to add a compact Canon to my collection. I have owned a Canon S2IS for several years and continue to be thrilled with the photo quality, but there are times when that camera is too bulky to bring to events where a 'pocket sized' camera is more convenient.I just wish I'd read more of the reviews on Amazon before making my purchase of the SD1200. I assumed it was an upgrade from the SD1100, how could it be any worse? I'm so unhappy with the photos it took on my recent vacation, I'm seriously considering buying the SD1100 to replace the SD1200.As one earlier reviewer wrote, \"This model replaces the 1100 IS camera, an excellent camera... In my opinion the pictures are not as sharp as the 1100 IS.\"I agree with this assessment. Nearly all photos were slightly less than crisp (despite making sure that the green focus lamp was on for all photos, and I know how to hold a camera pretty steadily). My biggest complaint is that in Auto Mode, the camera seems to want to revert to taking all indoor pictures at 400 ISO which resulted in very noisy overexposed/washed out pictures. There was no need for it to revert to this setting in Auto Mode. When I had time to set the camera to manual mode, it took acceptable pictures at 200 ISO when I had time to make sure the exposure/flash was at the correct intensity. But in spontaneous situations, there is no time to fuss with the manual mode and your shot is lost. I'm OK with reverting to Manual Mode when I really need to, but the photos in Auto Mode on average should not be so unacceptable.Another complaint I have about newer digital cameras is the upping of megapixels. Why are camera manufacturers pushing more megapixels down the throats of consumers? When you have such a tiny camera, with a small sensor and a tiny lens - extra megapixels do not result in better photo quality. If anything, it only results in emphasizing the weaknesses of the photo/camera by giving you a noisy, less than sharp image. In this race to pack in more megapixels because the consumers think this is what makes a great photo, it is the consumer who loses and we are getting a new generation of cameras with poorer image results than the previous generation of pocket sized digital cameras. Leave the 10+ megapixels for the high end SLR cameras where you may see a benefit.In all fairness, if image quality doesn't matter to you the camera rates well in other areas. It is very compact, it's easy to use, and the battery life was great. However, I'd sacrifice the ultra compact size for something, 1/4\" larger that takes better pictures any day.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Seems like the best out there for under $200!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2AB8SJ2SERS56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I have only had my camera a couple of hours, I have logged in many (some may say too many) hours of internet research to find the best small digital camera under $[...] and think I have found it!!

I tested it out at Best Buy, got a few quick pics of my 4 yr old and was totally sold! The camera took crisp pictures immediately. Crisp and quick were my main objectives since I pretty much only take pictures of my 2 and 4 yr old boys who are always on the go! : )I don't know about technical details of zoom, digital/optical etc, but was able to shoot a quick, clear image little video of my dog and was able to zoom while recording.

I was so pleased with the older model I bought this newer model without checking it firsthand at a store (after all it is many more features).  I've realized this was a huge mistake - and here's why:1. The first thing I noticed was the build quality of the camera was very poor - It looks poorly engineered and it is made entirely out of plastic now. Also it is now manufactured in China where as the older model was made of metal and manufactured in Japan.  Also all the accessories like the battery charger are noticeably cheaper.2. The battery life is really short - I would be lucky to get an hour's worth of use before the battery runs out - after being fully charged the night before.  I have recently discovered that there is a design/manufacturing issue with the seating of the battery and now when the low battery warning flashes I simply open the battery cover and jiggle the battery and the camera starts working again.  I discovered this out of frustration.3. Compared to the old camera - the flash really floods (or overexposes) an image and all the colors get washed out - so I end up using the flash as little as possible - but now the pictures become very grainy. Hence the photo quality is definitely not on par compared to the older model.I am definitely not a professional photographer and use the camera purely for photographing my kids so I keep the camera on it's default settings for almost all photos - I am telling you this so you understand I am a casual photographer and even my less discerning photographic needs are not being met by this camera.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera that takes good pictures", "Author": "Jaewoo Kim \"OB-Wan\"", "ReviewID": "R2B1YSUK6754T0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a top notch compact camera. Much of this camera's features have been written in other reviews. Here is what I would like to add.Pros:1)One of the major benefits of this camera is not just the hardware (Digic is one of the best photo processors and the lens of this camera is very good for a compact camera), but the software. The operating system of this camera is very usable and has a lot of functionalities. You can, for example, change the language settings among 20 or so different languages. My older Panasonic Lumix camera did not offer such a feature (it offered only 3 other languages). If you are a techie and want to customize every feature of your camera, then this camera will definitely will meet your needs.2)The battery seems to last forever. With one charge, you can easily take 200+ pictures with flash and still have good deal of battery power left. For most trips fewer than 15 days (and probably lot more), you will not need to bring the recharger unless you plan to go crazy with taking pictures.3)This camera easily fits into your pocket and its surface, including the display, is scratch resistent.Cons:1)When used in the \"auto\" mode, which is the default mode, there is a very noticeable lag of about 1.5-2.0 seconds between the press of the button and the actual snapshot. This camera is not made for motion capture snapshots (you can still take motion video shots).Conclusion:You can't go wrong with this camera as long as your expectations are reasonable. This camera will not take the highest quality pictures like the bulky and much more expensive SLR often used by professionals. And you will not be able to take 10 snapshots in 5 seconds as often required in motion capture photography.

But I took a bunch of test shots to see if I really liked it and wanted to re-purchase it. Keeping in mind I didn't get to review every aspect of the camera, what was my overall review after one day's worth of test shots? In one word: meh.There were highs and lows/pros and cons. I am sure I would grow to love it, but there are definitely things I like and things I don't.CONS?* The power button is harder to turn on (moreso one-handed like I normally do since I am rushing to take a quick picture of the baby). It doesn't stick out as much as on the SD600. (On the 600 I could quick push the raised button with my fingernail. On the 1200 the button is more flat so it's harder to reach.) Other reviews have liked this, as they don't want to accidentally turn their camera on...but in the four years I've used this camera, I've never had it turn on accidentally in any pocket, purse, bag, etc...so I don't like the new button style. I am sure, with time, I would get used to it...but my first impression wasn't favorable.* The slider bar (between auto, program, and video) is not as easy to slide as the 600--and it's a bit harder to do one-handed as well (which is how I normally use it, especially when taking pics of the baby). Again, I think the button was raised more on the 600 than on the 1200. I can slide the bar on the 600 by feeling the clicks as it moves from one status to the next--and can easily flick back and forth with ease. With the 1200, I had to pay special attention to moving it and I often overshot the status I wanted. Again, I am sure with time I would get used to it...but my first impression wasn't favorable.* The Auto function didn't seem to work as well as I thought it would--I got A LOT of blurry and too-dark and too-bright pictures that I really thought would be normalized with such a lauded AUTO feature. And I was sure I did things right (hold the button down halfway first, etc.). I really wanted to love the new features of Auto because I currently use Program all the time to adjust the amount of flash (so I can take closeups of the boy without blinding him or to add more flash when it's dark in the room) and Auto should take care of that. It may have just needed more experimentation? But then again, it shouldn't have--because it's AUTO.* The wrist strap isn't adjustable. It's not something I use a lot, but when I want it, I like having it there (like on a carnival ride or hanging over the balcony of a cruise ship). It's just a little thing, but it could be a very big thing if it's something that causes you to lose your camera. (If I bought this camera again, I would switch straps with my current camera, the 600.)PROS?* The ability to use a 16GB HDSC card! Pure heaven...especially since I take close to 1000 pictures a month of the kidlet! The 600 can handle a 2GB card which fits a lot of photos, and I rarely am away from home for so long that I can't offload the pictures...but I love having space and 16GB is enough to take tons of pictures and long videos without having to edit/delete photos while you go.* I do like the specific play button (instead of it being on the slider bar).* This camera takes the easiest and best macro photos of any I've ever owned. Pure awesome. (But how often do I need that? Not very.)* Some Auto flash shots turned out way better than I expected. Our living room is about 18' long and often dark. I just took a quick test shot from the kitchen and it lit up the entire room like daylight!* Most of the menu options are the same as my 600 so the learning curve wouldn't be too high.* I love that it's available in colors. Silver tends to get lost in the shuffle of mess on the counters or in a bag. But colors really stand out so it's easier to find quickly.So, will I be buying this camera again? I'm honestly still deciding, but am leaning towards probably not. I was really excited to get a new/better/faster camera...but it just didn't give me the big WOW factor I wanted and was expecting.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R1NKJC6ZJQG3EJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband and I love photography, and a few years ago we purchased a prosumer level SLR (Canon). Since it was quite cumbersome, we found we weren't really bringing it with us anywhere (other than to weddings), and because of this, we weren't taking as many pictures as we wanted. So, we decided to look for a really good quality, compact point-and-shoot for everyday use, at an affordable price (under $200 incl. a second battery, a memory stick, and a case). We wanted something we could have with us at all times, in case inspiration struck. And I can't tell you how pleased we are with our purchase of the Canon SD1200IS.SIZE: The first thing you'll notice is how small and light it is. It fits easily into even my smallest purse. And even with its small size, it still boasts a 2.5\" LCD screen.NO SHUTTERLAG: One of my favorite features of this camera is that you can take several pictures in a succession, without shutterlag, and without having to put it on a designated \"continual shoot\" setting. The other point-and-shoot digital cameras I've owned or have used in the past, have had quite a substantial lag time, and if you're photographing children, pets, sporting events and even weddings, you'd be lucky to get the shot you want. This camera is so fast, I often take 2 photos by accident.SMART AUTO: The (smart) AUTO mode, which I would normally advise against, actually works like you would expect it to, by choosing the proper settings for your conditions, automatically. Definitely a plus for those who want good-looking photos with minimal tinkering and effort. (Which is everyone, I'm guessing!)MACRO: The Macro setting is also pretty incredible. Don't quote me on this, but I'm fairly certain that while in AUTO mode, if you're close enough to your subject that it would warrant the Macro \"lens\", it will automatically switch to that setting so that your focus, and depth of field is spot-on. I took photos of some flowers on the macro setting and friends could not believe the incredible quality.DEPTH OF FIELD: I'm also highly impressed with the depth of field. Not until this camera had I thought this level of detail would be available on a consumer point-and-shoot, rather than a pro/prosumer SLR.LOW-LIGHT: And perhaps the best thing about this camera is it's ability to shoot effectively in low-light conditions. In most instances, I try to avoid using the flash. If you've ever tried to capture that warm, magical glow of your Christmas tree at night, you'll know that, without a tripod, it's virtually impossible. Not so, with this camera. On the \"Indoors\" setting with the flash turned off, I got some stunning, tripod-less photos of my home during the holidays and you would never have guessed that I used this camera and not my SLR.EASE OF USE: Having been so pleased with it ourselves, I recommended this camera to my girlfriend who is not even remotely technically saavy (and, therefore, did not read the helpful manual with which it comes). Basically, she had some trouble with the menu navigation (if you're at all familiar with Canon, you know they have their own way of doing things), but, after I gave her a quick 3 min. lesson on how to take basic, but good photos, and how to record and play-back video, she was off and running.We recently purchased a second SD1200IS as a gift for my father-in-law. His current 5+-year-old camera is terrible in low-light (he too hates to use the flash, but his photos look terrible) and it goes through batteries like there's no tomorrow. And that reminds me of another great thing about this camera.....BATTERY LIFE: I don't have any stats for you, but I'll just say that I did not expect a) the battery to last as long as it did - it exceeded my expectations based on previous experience by at least 100%, and b) these batteries charge fully (from empty) in about 30 min. As with any camera, I recommend purchasing a second battery so you never have to be without your camera. (I just got one on Amazon for $6.)But don't take my word for it.

If everything is perfectly still and there is excellent lighting, this camera will take a decent photo.

I'll upload some of our average photos with this camera later. I expected much better picutre qualit for one hundred seventy dollars. Our camera phones take better pictures. For what it's worth, we don't use auto mode as per other reviews, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. We did go to the store to look at this camera before we purchased and it handles well and pictures seem good looking at the lcd. But when you get them off the camera, they suck.

I've owned this camera for about 2 months and have used it several times indoors and outdoors.The good points are: 1. nice convenient size, easily fits in your purse or pocket; 2. great pictures most of the time with good lighting & outdoors, marginal (grainy) without flash at lower light levels indoors; 3. appears well built, feels like quality; 4. nice size display screen, bright & clear.The not so good points are: 1. must remove the battery to charge it, no dock or way to charge it while in the camera. Minor complaint, but annoying; 2. Significant problem: the focus operation of the camera is \"iffy\". Proper focus requires pushing the shutter button half way and allowing the camera to focus, which it usually does in a half second or so, and then continuing the button push to take the picture.  Unfortunately, pictures fairly often come out distinctly out of focus.  This also is true while taking video - two or three movie sequences will look fine, followed by one that is out of focus. Very frustrating!We have several Casio \"point & shoot\" cameras, most costing less than this Canon, that do a much better job at focusing.  For an otherwise great camera, its really disappointing.

You could get by with a 2gig card. A 2gig SD card would be good for 750 pictures.A 4gigSD card would get you 1,472 pictures.I like using( program mode ),  auto mode indoors seems to pick a very high iso and makes for to much noise in pictures, again thats just me though... outdoors auto mode  does better.  ( I keep the iso at 100 or 200) or use (auto iso) in program mode.The camera boots up in 1 sec, shot to shot is 1.5 secs, with the flash on 3 or 4 secs. (In auto mode) it is trying to focas all the time and is very noisey doing so... make sure you are holding as still as you can (so it won't think it should refocas again)  or it will blur your picture (that is another reason I use program mode) but you still have to hold very still. And if your new to this digital camera stuff remember to (save your pictures first,it will and does erase all your pictures) and then low level format your sd card.If you are in program mode and are having trouble with your scenery shots make sure that you go to the round 4way controll button on the back of camera and push the left side of it 3 times untill it says infinity and see if that helps any... Some times this works better than auto for scenery shots.*And if you are realy bored and have nothing to do #1 Set the camera to program mode, #2 Select \"ISO 100\" or even \"ISO 80\" for the best image quality, #3 select continous shoot mode(this is like rappid fire mode,don't forget to pre-focus the first picture. #4 Select \"V\" for \"Vivid\" on the colour setting and just shoot continous and just keep the shots you like. You can get to all these setings by pushing the Func Set button...Try this on your outside pictures, Just have fun with it. ( Set it to single shot if you prefer it is up to you ).There is a date feature on the SD1300, it shows up on the right side at the bottom of the picture.You can see it when reviewing the photo...Push menu button and scroll down, it is the very last idem there, You have 3 choices,(off), (date), (date and time)...When you go to take your picture your screen will have the word (DATE) on the screen above the iso reading, right side at bottom so you will know it is on...

If you have an HD tv that has a USB input, throw away the tv cable that comes with the camera and use USB memory sticks to view pictures. Composite images from the cable will be blurry.The biggest surprise to me was how good the videos are from the camera. I thought would be like my other point and shoot camera that has video. The video would be small and blurry. NOT! While I'm sure a true video camera is better, the video from the 1200 are plenty good enough to share with your friends through You Tube or email with out being ashamed of the quality. It shoot in AVI format.The only weirdness is finding all of the shot settings. I had to actually read the manual (gasp!) to find out where the other camera settings were. I'm talking about the settings like underwater, etc. Once you know where they are it's easy to find.Macro pictures using the built in flash work great. We have a business website and a lot of our products are small. The quality is good enough that I'm going to use the 1200 sometimes instead of my digital SLR just to save wear and tear on the SLR. The screen is good enough to allow you to really line up the picture before you shoot.

I was looking for a small camera without a wide angle lens to take pictures of family and friends at indoor and outdoor events.  My wide angle camera incuded more scenery than I wanted and picture qualty suffered. This SD1200SI solved that problem.  The SI feature is just what I needed to get better shots in all settings.I have been using it for about a month.  I used it to take about 60 flash photos of a large indoor gathering.  The flash refreshes very quickly and seemed to always be ready for the next picture.  None of the pictures were blurred. Only complaint is that the flash coverage begins to weaken beyond about 10 feet, but I knew that when I bought it.  I take all my pictures with the flash on, even outdoors so I never use Auto as the setting because I find that I get better results for indoor shots.  The auto focus is very good and quick.I also like the fact that the LCD can be set to stay on longer for multiple shots of indoor activities.  I also very much like the view finder.  I have a wide angle camera that does not have a view finder and even when the LCD is set to its brightest level, it is difficult to frame a shot in outdoor sunlight.  The view finder does rob some of the LCD area but the tradeoff is worth it to me.I also like the simplicity of its features.  Picture review has its own button, which works great.  All in all, this is a great little general purpose camera.  I have no problem with the size of buttons.  Everything about it seems to be designed correctly for the non-professional who just wants to take basic snapshots, indoors and outdoors.  I have not used the video so I cannot comment on it.

After some research, I realized it probably had to do with high ISO settings used in auto mode (whatever that means; I know nothing about the finer points of cameras), and I followed a recommendation that I saw in multiple user comments which was to put the camera in program mode and use the \"kids and pets\" setting. Result: very nice clear pictures. After further experimentation, auto mode seems to work fine outdoors with good light, but for indoor/low light pics kids and pets mode is the way to go. I wish it hadn't been such a struggle for me to figure that out--I wanted auto mode to do the job for me so I could point and shoot, not change a bunch of settings and shoot-- but I'm pleased with the pictures I'm getting now by just leaving the camera in kids and pets mode all the time.

I bought one for my son when we were looking for a small, easy to carry, inexpensive camera for him to take on his college study abroad in Tunisia.  When he came home and showed us his over 500 photos I was blown away by the quality of the pictures.  For this reason, when my wife and I were going on a Caribbean cruise, instead of schleping my Canon XSi or her S2IS both of which are much larger and clumsier to carry, we decided to order an SD1200IS along with a 4G card, accidental damage warranty and carrying case from Amazon, all for just over $200. Well, we are back from our trip, attached the camera to directly to our TV to look at the pics and the SD1200, once again, did not disappoint. Although I know my way around a digital camera I am far from an experienced or professional photographer.  I can not give a detailed, technical review as many other have posted here. Let me just say what I liked:1.  As I stated, the picture quality is wonderful and consistent given the price of this camera.2. The image stabilization works well and even pictures taken out the window of a moving vehicle are clear and crisp.3.  Having an optical viewfinder is a plus, especially when taking pictures in the bright Caribbean sunlight.4. The size and weight make it comfortable to stick in a shirt or pant pocket while still being easy for someone with large hands to operate.5.  I was concerned about the modest 3x zoom but found that the pictures are good enough that zooming into a particular area of the picture while in your photo software (or even while viewing on your TV) allows you to see close up clearly.6.  I did not find the need to bother with any special settings, other than the occasional use of fill flash in the program mode.  Otherwise I just left it on full auto and let it do its thing.7.  Although the movie mode is not \"HD\" and I did not use it extensively, it is certainly good enough for the occasional recording of a video.The bottom line is that, for the price, size and ease of use of this camera I don't think it can be beaten.

Before I purchased this Cannon SD1200 Elph I read all the reviews I could find and I just can't believe some of the negative reviews. Either these people got a LEMON (which I doubt) or they just don't know how to operate a really good camera. The one very special thing that I love is the \"Date Stamp\" feature. It makes it so great to be able to see on your photos when and what time the picture was taken.The compactness of this camera is just perfect. No protrusions to snag as you retieve it from your pocket or case. I use a very inexpensive fabric belt case with a velcro flap. If only the owner would take a little time to read the manual or even take a camera class they would find that they could take excellent pictures. I take most of my pictures without the flash since falsh has a tendancy to wash out a lot of color. Most indoor shots can be taken quite successfuly by setting the camera to the \"SCN\" mode and turning off the flash. The \"auto\" mode is great too but just remember that it will automatically select the flash if its too dark and then if you are too far away from you subject the shot will turn out dark. The flash is ony good for short distances. I would not go farther than 6 feet.This is one \"solid\" little camera.

It's fun, portable and relatively easy to use!Advantages:*Easy to use- The camera was very easy to set up. All I had to do was put the battery in and the memory card (sold separately) and it worked. It was also relatively easy to figure out, once I realized that tapping the camera focused it, instead of taking pictures. Automatic mode is very easy to figure out, and I've only gotten great pictures out of it!*Size- The camera is very portable and will fit in most cases. It is about the size of a credit card. It is pretty light, which makes it feel fragile, but I haven't had any problems with it breaking so far.*Sharp, clear photos- The photos have been very clear in my opinion. When uploaded to the computer, they are large (3648 by 2736 pixels or 20.267 by 15.2 inches at 100%) and when at their largest, can show things that are barely visible to the eye. I have found that compared to other cameras I have seen, this shows better detail.*Good videos- The videos were surprisingly good. They showed a nice image, and the volume was pretty clear, which surprised me. I was very impressed with the video quality. The only problem was they did detect some shaking of the hand, but I think a tripod would easily fix this problem.*ZoomBrowser Ex- This is the software that comes with the camera. It is simple and easy to use. It is not for editing photos, just uploading them, but it was easy to download, and it always does its job quickly and effectively. It also makes it easier to organize them.*Rechargeable battery- I really like the fact that the battery is rechargeable. It's nice to be able to know how long your battery will last, and it saves money on not having to buy replacement batteries. The battery needed to be charged within a few hours of getting the camera, but other than than, it's lasted about 5 days, with me having the camera on a few times a day. It charges in a little less than 2 hours.*Fast- The camera turns on quickly and takes pictures pretty quickly as well. It's good when you need to capture something happening right at that moment.Disadvantages*No memory card included- This wasn't a problem for me, as they told me there was nothing when I bought the camera, and I was planning on getting one anyway, but definately don't buy one without a card- you won't be able to take pictures.*Manual is vague- The manual is good about telling you how to set up and use the camera but nothing else really. It doesn't explain any features of the camera.For cases, I would recommend:Sleeve Case (Magenta) and Tripod for Canon PowerShot SD1200IS Digital Camera Light GrayIt also comes with a tripod, and room for the cord. I think it's pretty good.Overall, I really like this camera. It is not for a professional photographer, but someone who enjoys taking photos as a hobby, or just wants photos of their family.

I needed a small pocket sized camera to complement my SLR pro camera and my \"bridge\" medium sized camera. It's not always convenient or practical to haul around a DSLR, camera bag, etc. Having had a professional DSLR camera for several years, I realized I had to be willing to give up some features and quality in a small point and shoot. However, I was not willing to compromise picture quality and color balance. I wanted a camera that is adequate indoors as well as outdoors plus have enough manual controls to manipulate the settings per my preference. After evaluating the S90, S780, S790, S200, and the SD1200IS, I have concluded that for the price vs. picture quality and camera size, I selected the SD1200IS. Although the other cameras all cost more - $200 - $400 they are great cameras but the SD1200IS produces just as good of quality pictures, if not better, than those evaluated in this review.Considering, I am not interested in video ( I have a small camcorder for that purpose) and I wanted the best quality I could get in the smallest camera, my conclusion was the SD1200IS. I would have paid up to $400 for the other cameras. However, it isn't necessary for the features and quality I desired.Pros about the the SD1200IS- my experience with the camera is consistent with all of the Amazon reviews I read. Thank you all for giving you feedback and helping me make this decision.- great small size (fits in my pocket)- good picture quality (pixelation and color balance). At 100% picture size, there is little pixelation and artifacts. My observations were that the SD1200IS shot at 800 ISO compared to my Canon DSLR (15 MP) at lower ISO yield comparable picture quality. Hard to complain about that.- good photos in low light conditions- Flash reaches over 15 feet in a dimly lit room and produces great natural pictures.- Battery holds a good charge- Love the ease of menus that Canon provides- Ease of use: my 72 year old father good operate this camera (and he is not a fan of electronics)A few Cons:- there is a shutter delay when depressing the button.- the battery door is a bit flimsyOverall, I am quite pleased with the camera.

I took night time pics of a downtown city and Christmas lights.  The pictures were beautiful.  The macro feature also works great for close up photos.I took two night pics of the big red V sign at the Varsity in Atlanta. One with this Canon, one with a Sony DSC-H20. Neither camera was totally accurate with color, since they both took it slightly more orange than it was in real life. But the Canon photo (when zoomed at 100% in Photoshop) took a sharper image. The letters, twigs and leaves were all sharper, and some leaves in the upper corner were brighter. The Sony was fuzzier, the letters were blurrier and more hazy. The leaves in the corner were also darker. But the Sony was slightly more accurate with color.One quirk:  A few times in Auto mode, this Canon camera tried to use the Macro feature for something that was not close up, so I had to switch to P mode. But that doesn't happen often.The biggest annoyance I have had so far is that the new class 4 high speed memory card I bought is not readable in the older card reader in my computer.  So I have to hook up the camera with the USB cable. And a couple of times, this has locked up my PC, and it wants to default to using the \"Microsoft camera and scanner wizard\" to download the photos.  I have not installed the Canon software, so that might be the problem.  But I never installed any of the software that came with my Sony cameras, either, and I never had that type of problem with them.Sometimes I am able to hook the camera up with no problem, and just click its drive in My Computer to open the photos, but sometimes it doesn't work well.  So I don't know if this is a Canon issue.  My computer has been upgraded with a new hard drive and more RAM, so I don't think it's the PC.The camera takes good quality video clips as well. They record in AVI format, which opens right up in Windows Media Player.  But I had a problem last night with a 7 minute video clip that had errors after it was pulled onto my desktop.  WMP would not read it, and it showed up as 0 bytes in file size.  I don't know why, since it played just fine on the camera.  So I had to open up the Microsoft Camera Wizard & use it to copy just that one video file.  It worked better that time.  I am using a Lexar memory card, class 4, SDHC.  Maybe I need to use another brand of memory?  if anybody has ideas, let me know.  I thought that somewhere I read Canon recommends SanDisk.One thing to know:  If you want to use zoom in video mode, do not zoom in and THEN start recording, because it will lock the zoom in and you can't move it in or out. Zoom out first, start recording, THEN use the zoom.  Also the puny 3X zoom does not help much in video mode.  The zoom works to take better quality still photos, than what it does in video mode.The camera starts up really fast and is easy to use.  I wish the zoom was bigger.  The battery door hinge is kind of flimsy.  I also wish these little compact cameras were bigger or had bigger grips on the side. They need to put the back buttons on the left side, instead of the right, since most people are right handed.  If you need to grip the camera with one hand, you always worry about accidentally pressing a function button while taking a photo.  It would be nice if the flash was closer to the middle, and the little speaker on the back was closer to the middle.  They are both in spots where somebody could accidentally put their finger over them, if they weren't paying attention. I wish the silver ring around the lens was frosted metal, because the shiny metal shows lots of fingerprints.But those are really minor flaws.

I use it as a second camera when I don't want to haul around my bulkier Digital SLR. The optical viewfinder is a nice feature. Canon seems to be one of the only brands to still make subcompact/compact cameras with an optical viewfinder. It saves battery life and if you take shots with the LCD function turned off Canon claims you can get around 700 shots, more than double if you use the LCD display.The optical viewfinder is a nice option in bright sunlight when the LCD display is hard to see or if you run low on juice without a spare. You can always review your shots on the LCD with the press of a button if you have the auto review set to off.To load your images, You can simply plug and play with Windows XP. Using Windows XP there is no need to download any of the Canon software (Including ZoomBrowser EX) if you have any basic Photo Editing programs. The supplied Canon package gives you just the basic photo editing functions and the Canon Movie Maker is pretty much the same as XP's Movie Maker 2. After seeing what the Canon software did, I quickly uninstalled it and just went with what XP and my Photo Editing program had. You plug in the Camera turn it on and follow XP's Camera wizard. Same with the Movie files. The Video function is very nice and takes nice images. On best quality (640x380) 30 frames per sec, You can get up to 32 minutes on a 4 GB card. Only the digital zoom, not the optical works while in movie mode so whatever focal length you start out with it's pretty much set. The digital zoom just digitally magnifies the image so zoom quality will drop off. Not too bad considering the small size and convienience of the camera. With the RCA cable ends on the supplied adapter you can hook the camera up to your TV and view photos or Movies. If you have a DVD recorder you can record your movies direct to DVD,  just remember to press the Display button to turn off the Time Display info overlay on your camera or it will record that too!Another note, I had a tough time to get the Auto Focus Assist Beam to turn off.

The little program is easy to navigate and I have gotten my artwork photographed and rendered so well that people thought it was scanned instead of photographed.I'm finding some reviews on here saying that the images are blurry. Either I'm blind, don't understand picture quality, or those cameras were not working how they should, because I have been able to adjust settings easily to get pictures incredibly beautiful, sharp and bright.Now that I think about it, I was at a theme park with my friend shortly after I bought this and took a picture while on a ride. The photo is on Facebook and people commented saying it did not even look like a picture. One person said, \"It looks like I can reach out and touch your hand.\" It was very lifelike- almost frightening when I look back on it! So I myself have had no issues with picture quality.It's certainly not for professional photography or anything, but it gets the job done exceedingly well.It's been over two years with zero malfunctions whatsoever. Nothing but good times with this little device. Durability is great so if you're looking on buying it used, you'll have a fine time if the person did not absolutely abuse their camera.For the record I paid about $150 for this camera. Get it for such a price where you can find it.If you're looking for a quality camera, decide on this one!", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "I Dance in Shadow", "ReviewID": "RVBVWC7ZL1QH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an old kodak digital camera that was basically falling apart so I decided to get a new one.

My prior Canon was an 8MP and for the price I had to upgrade to this little gem. I love how I am able to focus on multiple faces at once which comes in handy when taking pics of my many little toddlers! Also, in the manual mode, there are so many more settings than the prior model so that you can take great pics at the pool, beach, fireworks, sunsets, snow, underwater (i.e. at the Aquarium, not submerging the camera) pets and kids, you name it and they don't turn out too bright or too dark like you find at the beach, sunset, and fireworks. The battery charge lasts forever. I charge it maybe once a month and I use it pretty much every day. The only downside I have found is that the optical zoom is not as high as some other cameras, so from a distance if you try to zoom too much, the picture ends up a little blurry. All in all, I highly recommend this camera to any mom that needs a quality camera to throw in her purse (it's so tiny and perfect to fit in even the smallest ones!) to take pics of rambunctious kids and pets.

One switch changes the automatic, manual and video mode. One definate plus- Once the manual settings are done the camera will remember them. Even if the camera is turned off and on. This is helpful if there are two different people taking pictures during the day (I like the manual mode, my wife prefers the automatic).

The screen size is adequate and can be adjusted for brightness. The display button will show the on screen display, display off, or just the subject. The included CD is the manual and software (sorry no book). There is a small \"getting started\" booklet included. The software lets the user edit pictures before they are uploaded or after.

This was not an issue with the two Cannon predecessors I owned?  The power button is smaller which is a great safety improvement as my last camera was totaled when the power button was accidentally pushed on while in my pocket, the lens tried to extend in my pocket but could not thereby jamming -boom totaled camera.  So by upgrading I get higher density shots with great quality especially zoom, better movies, even a more compact camera, but take double shots for the 20% that I plan may be out of focus.

K.", "ReviewID": "RZ087S1FB9KOB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After toying with a Canon SD1100 IS that belongs to a friend of mine, and deciding that my 7 year old Nikon point-and-shoot needed to be upgraded, I had made my decision on a new purchase.  However, the Canon SD1100 had been discontinued by Canon and was no longer available from retailers.  Most sites direct you to the SD1200 IS as the \"newer model\", just like Amazon does.Thinking it really was just the \"newer model\" to the Canon SD1100, I went ahead and purchased the SD1200.  The price was right, and there was free shipping to boot - what did I have to lose?Apparently - a lot.When I opened the box I was taken aback by the feel of the SD1200 IS camera.  It is EXTREMELY light weight compared to the SD1100, and almost feels \"plastic-y\" and \"cheap\".  But, this really wasn't a big deal to me as it was small, light, and portable, and my primary focus was with the feature set.  So I charged up the battery and waited in anxious anticipation to try out my new toy.  Once the battery was fully charged, I powered up the camera with a blank SD card to give it a go.  Immediately, I was disappointed.The #1 feature I need was GONE from this camera.  Stitch Assist, or what other manufacturers call Panorama Assist, is NONEXISTENT on this camera.  Nada - zilch - zero.  Some people may tell you that \"technically, you can still stitch photos\", you just need to do it manually.  Yes, that is correct.  You can take photos in a sequence and stitch them manually in the Canon software, but that doesn't mean they will look good.  Without Stitch Assist, the camera's ISO and white balance settings will not lock, and will likely change between photos.  This results in a patchwork looking panoramic photo.  So while the photos may align, the colors/exposure will vary between frames.  Yes, you could manually set the ISO, etc., but now you are adding multiple steps (which you must remember to do) for what used to be a simple procedure of selecting a preset \"scene\".  This is a huge knock to this camera, which relegates it to the \"beginner\" or \"novice\" category of camera.I am involved in engineering and architecture, and rely on the Stitch Assist feature daily for my work.  Removing it (along with some other shooting modes, like Color Swap, etc.) from the SD1200 was an obvious attempt by Canon to get you to spend an extra $60 on a better model for these features, which are now provided as basic options from most manufacturers.To me, this is a useless camera, and it has already been boxed up with a return label to be returned to Amazon.  Canon - you really let me down with the SD1200 IS - and you should never have marketed it as a \"newer model\" to the Canon SD1100.  It doesn't even compare.Fool me once, shame on me.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "very UNDER impressed", "Author": "J.

The other Kodak I left SOMEWHERE?), a Sony Cybershot DSC-W150 and in March 2010 I purchased my beautiful turquoise Canon PowerShot.None of my previous cameras could handle the photo load I demanded nor could any of them hold a charge long enough for me.

And basically, that's all us amateurs want...a camera that holds a battery charge and takes LOTS of photos AND movies!Enter my Canon cutie, this camera is more than awesome.  Its simple to operate and the memory card is awesome. I've taken over 800 photos without charging the battery or downloading photos.  That was unheard of with the Sony (the Sony failed on me---the shutter stopped opening---kinda hard to take photos without that working feature).One of my favorite features is the 'repeat photo' feature which allows you to take one photo after the other by simply holding your finger down on the 'capture' button. This is great for photographing grandchildren at play.  Of course I could switch to 'movie mode' but I like the spontaneity of this feature.The blurriness and grainy photos mentioned in some reviews sound like they're due to low resolution settings. If you want to open the box and start clicking, you can do that.  I did and got great results.  But I've also taken blurry photos when my settings were not correct for the circumstance.For instance, to use the super focus feature, you have to hold the capture button down half-way momentarily for the camera to focus, then click.

I have owned a few Canons before this one and I find that the features have mostly kept improving, year to year and model to model. The picture quality is fantastic; much clearer than years before. The size is nice too; I can actually walk around with this in my pocket and not feel incredibly cramped.One thing that I dislike is the size of the viewfinder - quite small, and not as useful as I'm accustomed to. However, seeing as how most people don't really use this part of the camera nowadays, I suppose it's not really a negative factor for most of today's casual photographers. The battery lasts quite a while, (I took it on a five-day trip to Utah, Vegas and the Grand Canyon, without charging it at all!) but if you are switching from a camera running on AA batteries to a rechargable one, remembering the charger is a new habit you'll have to get used to. It saves so much money though, that the convinience of buying batteries at any drugstore is swiftly overshadowed by the convinience of a battery that rarely dies.Other features are relatively easy to use; the wheel maintains it's place as on most canons, although you might have to do a bit of tinkering to find all of the settings. I dislike not having a 'fireworks' or 'beach' setting, but seeing as how exposure time is quickly reached with a single button, (top of the circle under the wheel), it's really just a matter of clicking a few different controls. There are too many great features to list that would make up for the slight differences this camera might have to whatever you might be switching from.All in all, I'd recommend this camera to anyone. It's easy enough for a rare user to understand, and convinient enough to serve as a more portable device for semi-professional photographers without the option of space or equipment.

I am hard on my cameras - I am a blogger so my camera is always in my bag, on my wrist, in my pocket.  I need a camera that is reliable, small, and can take clear, quick photos and videos.  When my last camera died a sad death from falling onto concrete, I knew I would come back to Canon.The only problem I have is that one reason I return to Canon is that over the years, I have accumulated plenty of batteries and chargers from dead cameras.  The PowerShot SD1200IS does NOT have the same size battery as the previous Canon cameras.  In fact, this battery isn't the same width as the Canon battery on my camcorder, my work's camcorders or my husband's professional Canon cameras.  I was really frustrated by this - I usually have a charger at work, one at home, have one available for travel in my bag.  I also like to have an extra battery on hand for travel.  With this camera, I would have to invest in all new equipment.That being said, this new battery holds charge for an incredibly long period of time.  I take at least one photo per day, and around 5 short videos per week.  I hadn't charged the battery in almost two weeks before I went to a 4-day music festival.  For four days, I took almost 200 photos and 15 videos.  The battery kept ticking through the whole event, no delay or slowing.  The battery didn't start to die until a couple days after my return.  I have never seen a battery last that long on any other camera!I find the body to be durable, more so than previous Canons I have bought.  The latch for the batter/card slots is pretty sturdy, the buttons are flush against the back of the camera so they aren't as likely to accidentally be pressed or scraped against something.  Speaking of buttons, I find them to be very user friendly - similar to other Canon cameras, easy to figure out even in the dark.Pictures are clear, don't get wash out from the flash, even night photos come out well.

Fortunately I had purchased a 16GB card at the time I ordered the camera.  The cards that come with many of the lower priced cameras are usually pretty small anyways and are replaced at some point.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent....better even than expected!", "Author": "Shirley J.

I definitely agree with all the good reviews.  This camera is small, it has a nice size LCD, and even though I love the new bigger, touchscreen LCD's in some newer models, this camera has better image quality.  It has automatic as well as manual settings and they're easy to set up, and available right from the homescreen.  For low light inside settings, the manual ISO settings work well, the picture does become a bit grainy on lower settings, but this is expected for this type of digital camera.  I love the fact that it has a timer and the option to customize the time and number of shots as well.  It has many extras such as slideshow, cropping and red eye correction all built into the camera. It also has optical image stabilization, which is better than digital stabilization. The video quality is decent, good for internet posting or emailing.This camera actually works excellent compared to most models in this price range, it's very hard to find anything better unless you're willing to pay over $300.  Plus, the battery life is extremely good, I've taken over a thousand pictures and I'm only on my 4th battery charge so far.Edited to add that this camera doesn't have any internal memory, so just keep that in mind.One more thing, with some Cannon printers, you have the option to connect the camera and print right from it without having to buy an additional dock and it has some extra features as well when used together.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "CANON POWERSHOT", "Author": "DAVID TAYLOR", "ReviewID": "R1IAQIO47A8G38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY!

The downside is that it certainly feels like it would be easy to drop because it is so small. To combat this, Canon includes a wrist strap to help anchor it to the user's arm, but I wish that the strap had a way to tighten towards your wrist. I'd imagine this isn't specific to this camera, and it probably more of a Canon compliant.The picture quality is impressive, and the auto-focus works 90% of the time.

I know I bought a discontinued item, but it had one feature I really wanted, which was a viewfinder.  Getting a camera with a viewfinder is very rare these days.  I found with my last camera that I used the viewfinder a lot -- especially in sunny situations where the sun renders the screen not visible.  However, I found that you don't see as much in the viewfinder as you see on the screen.  So you have to know that you will get more background than you are seeing if you rely on the viewfinder.The controls are easy, although I preferred the dial that allowed me to switch modes quickly on my previous camera.  It just takes getting used to.  Review of pictures is easier than my previous camera -- there's a separate button for it and you don't have to open the lens to review pictures, which is good when the camera is being handed from person to person for reviews.Taking pictures on the auto setting takes longer as the camera has to figure out which mode to use first.  So I ended up missing a few shots or the shots ended up being blurry.  I solved that my selecting the setting myself (i.e., cloudy, portrait, landscape). Microphone for video is on the back, so sound on videos did not get picked up very well.  That means that the videographer must narrate better.

My husband and I have used this camera for over a year, and many of the newer 12 and 14mp cameras out now (april 2010) just don't compare. We get great crisp, true color photos, even in very low light situations. We rarely use it in any mode other than auto, and it does great for us. Since we have bought this camera we thought it would be nice to upgrade from great to super great. We have not been able to find a camera that even comes close, with the exception of the 14mp panasonic lumix fp2, which is a similar price (original price at the time the cannon was purchased). In all honesty, with the exception of the pixels, the panasonic's not really much better, just different. It's little too vibrant or \"happy\" in the color area, we prefer the more realistic color of the cannon sd1200. They are both great cameras, but this cannon really holds up well to the new cameras out as of april 2010, in our opinion. We have never gotten a blurry picture, unless the camera shake was totally outrageous. After the first battery charge, you will see the battery life is great. I am actually jealous that my husband uses this cannon camera and i get the new 14mp panasonic we purchased. Absolutely NONE of the newer fujifilm (12mp+) cameras did well, in all the models we tested and ended up returning, they did terrible in low light. Unless something is wrong with your camera, you will be happy with this canon model. Not sure if a more professional photographer will be happy with it or not, but we love it all the way!!!", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid with Great Feature Choices", "Author": "JonShops", "ReviewID": "R1A0GIEMGSIPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: This camera has a great look and feel. More compact than pictures of it may seem, but not wafer thin like some. Doesn't have lush interface, just a practical and elegant one. For example, only about 5 different auto modes ('Portrait', 'Kids', etc.) that don't have example pictures; instead, you see the current shot as altered for that mode. When you press OK button options appear down right and across bottom of view screen; you select by navigating with ring button around OK.You have direct EV+/- control via ring button and can easily set white balance via interface.  Also has 'My Color' feature that lets you set color saturation, etc. via interface in Program mode: this feature is very detailed. Program mode is not complete...cannot select shutter or f-stop priority, but does include ISO setting, so you basically can trade off noise for blur (low ISO reduces noise but slows the shutter). You just can't add depth-of-field to the mix of trade-offs without 'tricking' the settings via EV and ISO.Low ISO shooting makes a huge difference in picture quality to the point that shooting 10MP instead of 5MP at over ISO 300 is of dubious benefit. 'Indoors' auto mode lowers ISO for you, but using Program mode and lowering it more is better if the subject is stationary. With lots of light or a tripod photos are lavish even when zoomed when shooting ISO 80.So at low ISO low-light shooting is great, but not for moving subjects or unsteady hands. The cammera has optical stabilization, and I've shot reasonable photos at a 1 second shutter free hand, but it takes some breathing control.Playback has the standard zoom feature and can zoom out to either a panel of thumbnails or else a faux-3D picture cycle. Will also show all settings for the shot, even settings the camera set automatically like shutter speed. Also shows true file size along with the resolution and assumed file size for that setting (the assumed size is a worst-case assumption). The camera always shows this assumed size with resolution, which is handy, but it names the resolutions with single letters, a la VHS SP,SLP, etc., so that's what the funny L means in the corner: L=highest resolution.In spite of some spec sheets saying it's 700mAh, this camera comes with a 1000mAh battery that is said to be capable of 700 shots when using the optical viewfinder, 220 shots using the LCD viewscreen--I assume without flash.Camera offers three metering selections: full average, center-weighted, and spot. The face detection is nearly perfect...it can even follow faces through cross cuts while 'watching' TV, and it can recognize 3/4 views of faces--oblique views.Power-on time is remarkably fast. No problems with shooting speed. Flash might slow things down, but unbounced flash shots are usually so icky I hardly use flash...it is said to be good from 1 foot (1 meter if shooting into eyes!) to 14 feet.Camera has a magic red ray that it says helps with autofocus. You can turn it off, and I haven't really noticed much of a difference with it off.CONS: In auto modes the camera picks higher ISO than I would like because I'm not shooting sports shots, etc., but I think the choices are good ones in general, and they can be overridden easily. The icons are not exactly self-evident. Camera does not come with a manual worth mentioning (but PDF is available). I can't speak to the software as I have no intention of using it.The macro settings produce otherwise nice results but they are a little more fish-eye than would be ideal.In full auto mode (separate even from the individual automatic modes) the camera is constantly focusing, etc., which must use up battery pretty fast. Just lightly pressing the shutter release will force settings in other modes, so unless you are shooting rapidly changing subjects the full auto mode is probably overkill.Misses some of the more advance features even of my 5-year-old digital. You cannot set up your own preset settings and pick them like they were built-in modes. There is no internal memory at all. There is no self-portrait modes where you can set up a photo and then have yourself placed in the picture by getting someone to line up a translucent version of your setup with the scene with you in it. Etc.

All my photos are based on automatic settings, but it surprises me how often there is enough light--how rarely the flash is used.  This takes great pictures in darker settings without using the flash--it's far different from the past cameras I've used.Sometimes I need closeups in a dark location of small parts.

Upon receipt I took it out of the box to test it out first to make sure it wasn't broken.  I WAS INSTANTLY BLOWN AWAY BY BOTH THE 1st AND 2ND INDOOR PICTURES I TOOK!  It takes exactly the kind of clear indoor photos that I had been looking for. I simply took it out of the box, charged the battery and started snapping. UNLIKE THE MORE EXPENSIVE CANONS I HAD SENT BACK, I DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE ANY ADJUSMENTS ON THIS ONE TO GET DECENT PICTURES. Cystal clear & bright indoor pictures, even on the LCD.  Decent indoor auto flash.  The functions are very simple and easy to understand. It's much slimmer than other digital cameras, more like a cellphone, therefore fitting easy into your pocket. For picture quality and portability, it gets 5 stars from me. This is the kind of pal-camera that you would want ready for a quick trip or a family function. And I love the chargeable battery & battery charger that it comes with. However, you'll have to buy your own memory card because this model does not come with a free one, but who cares?

The only thing that I thought could have been better was more options for post processing and scene lighting presets are rather limited. However, if you really don't like messing with the settings too much for quick photos it pulls this off very well.  They even throw in something that most digital cameras have phased out by now, a manual view finder.

Great resolution, vibrant colors, image stability and its ability to start up in a matter of a second or two were all great positives.  Really simple point-click function with a speedy replay button.It's also very conveniently small and fits in nearly any pocket that a cell phone would.  Sadly, this was its undoing for me.  I forgot it was in my swimming trunks pocket until I jumped back into the boat after a 30-minute ocean snorkeling session.  Whoops.

I can compare it directly to the SD 550 and SD 750 Canons which I also own (though the 550 now has been handed down to my 7 year old daughter), as well as the Rebel XSI. The SD 750 is an excellent camera which has served our family well, so why you ask did I buy the 1200? I purchased this primarily for two reasons which may also apply to you. Firstly, the IS feature allows much-more-watchable video and secondly, the battery is the same type that is used by my Canon D10 (waterproof camera) - this is very helpful in terms of carrying around fewer bulky chargers. The relatively-low price for a camera of this quality was also a factor.I was concerned a bit about buying this camera as some reviews here noted blurry shots, with some later reviews noting that camera came set to low resolution. As for my unit, it came set to highest resolution (as did the SD 550 and SD 750 to my recollection). I wonder if some of the reviewers somehow got a refurbished model since as far as I can tell the camera firmware comes automatically set to highest resolution for Canon cameras in general.To check photo quality, I have made a direct comparison between the SD 750 and SD 1200 by taking identical shots of what passes for me as a 'still life' - some toys on a couch with detailed pattern in semi-dark conditions requiring flash. Zooming in closely on those shots, it appears that the flash is a little brighter on the 1200 but otherwise detail is identical. As the SD 750 is a 7.1 MP camera and this one is 10 MP, one might expect (understandably) higher resolution from this camera but this ends up being an excellent illustration of the \"megapixel myth.\" Though companies have latched onto increasing megapixels as a marketing thing there is really diminishing returns as one goes up due to other limitations, notably sensor noise and especially limits imposed by the optics. You can't get blood from a stone and you also can't get increasingly higher-resolution images from the small lenses on cameras like this one. That is not to say the images are bad, just that they don't compare to DSLR images from say a Canon Rebel XSI or a Nikon D300 - but this is certainly not a criticism as this camera is not intended as a substitute for a DSLR.Video quality is similar to that on my SD 750 though the IS does definitely improve the stability of the shots and should allow them to be better mixed into footage from a dedicated video camera. It is interesting that though one may never intend to use this type of camera for video inevitably the time will come when this is all that is available, and in fact with kids that happens pretty frequently! The best camera for the shot or video is, of course, the one you actually have with you at the time!The camera controls will seem second-nature if you have used Canons in the past. The door to the battery/SD compartment does seem a bit more flimsy than my prior models but is working well so far.In summary, this is a very portable compact camera that does the job of serving as an always-available camera and also can serve as backup to a DLSR or other higher-quality camera.

Finally, I was torn between the Canon PowerShot A1100IS 12.1 MP and this camera, which has a smaller MP number and is more expensive. Logic would say to buy the one that is $129 with the higher MP. In the end I chose this one because its smaller and less-bulky. I tested both in-store and found this model to be more adequate to what I wanted. Basically, I wanted to take your everyday pictures but also needed a camera that can take good close-ups for selling some items on ebay and whatnot. This camera does exactly that and a 10MP vs. a 12 MP is not that big a difference. This camera did exactly everything I wanted and exceeded my expectations. I've read some reviews on here where people complain about the noise it makes when focusing. I am not sure if these people have lives who would let such a minor thing deter them from buying a camera. It is louder than other cameras I've owned, but its not annoying by any means. In my mind this is a perfect camera.

Pope", "ReviewID": "RN1HHI2I29LLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted something that is very portable but still takes great quality pictures, has enough but not too many features, and operates quickly and easily.  It turns on quickly, it has much less delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture than cameras I've used previously, and you can take another picture right away without much of a delay at all.  In fact, you can hold the shutter button down as long as you want to (providing the flash is not on) and it will continue taking 1.4 pictures per second, which is much faster than many others I looked at.  This is something the newer 1300 and 1400 models don't seem to have.  I also like having a viewfinder for those bright sunny days where it is difficult to see the LCD screen, although the screen is great in most conditions.  The viewfinder is small, but it's better than not having one.  You do have to keep in mind that you need to zoom out more than you think you need to while using the viewfinder, though.  The viewfinder and quick burst mode are what made me choose the 1200 model over the newer ones.  The 1200 doesn't have HD video (which is fine since I don't have an HD TV), but the quality is still good, and you can zoom while taking video without hearing the shutter move in the video.  And there is sound when you play them back on the camera, as is not the case with many other point and shoot cameras that don't have a speaker on them.  The only thing I wish this camera had was a little more zoom, but it's not bad.  It actually stops zooming in between optical and digital zoom and then you can hit the zoom button again if you want to zoom further, which is nice if you don't like the digital zoom as much.  There is only a basic printed manual that comes with the camera, but a more detailed one comes on the provided CD that you have to upload onto your computer to read.  I haven't checked out the software that came with the camera for modifying the pictures or printed any pictures yet, but I anticipate both will be fine. Also, other reviewers have commented on how blurry their pictures were, but they probably had the megapixels on the camera set too low.  I have gotten lots of nice crisp, sharp pictures so far (both still and action shots) with the camera set at 6 MP so my file size isn't too big.  And I am taking a lot more pictures than I have in the past because the camera is more portable than my previous cameras.  I love the green color and it feels comfortable to hold, but it is a little slippery so you do have to be careful. The buttons are small as well, so I have to use my fingernail to use them, but I like how the camera is all laid out (both the menus and the location of the buttons). For being a point and shoot, it's a great choice at a reasonable price.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for the same features I was.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "This Camera Kicks ASS!", "Author": "A. LOCOCO \"TDB, LLC.\"", "ReviewID": "R2NSQXJ9AYBKFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I look at some of the other reviews I am wondering a few things: 1. Are these folks reviewing the same camera?  2. Did they get a broken/faulty one?  3. Did someone in their family drop it w/o their knowing?  4. Did they sniff a considerable amount of glue before operating it?I'm not trying to be a jerk but this camera kicks!  I have had other Canon cameras, there are a few I looked at that I absolutely did not like and would not buy.  But this one is the least expensive ELPH with the latest D4 processor, as usual it has WAY too many functions.  Last week at the zoo I mastered the rapid fire photo mode, anyone with a 4 y/o will appreciate that mode and it works great to catch memories-in-motion.  I caught expressions that I normally miss.  You will need a large data card but I deleted the unwanted extra frames when reviewing on my pc.  Movie clip mode is even better than my other two Canons A500 series and A80, [four and eight years old].It does have more settings and noticed the full auto function tends to over flash a bit indoors causing some wash-out, but like any product you have to get to know your camera!  We tend to expect gizmos to do all of the thinking for us, that is an unrealistic expectation.  I told my wife try full auto flash and try it w/o for best results in different conditions.  I have noticed that eventhough cameras now have a huge screen to instantly check your picture folks don't...they shoot away without giving it a second thought.  Then they get home and are pissed when the pic's suck, well it's not always the cameras fault.  A lot of times I have caught my wife taking pic's with the camera in the wrong shoot mode...Oops!  maybe one day cameras will talk, \"hey dummy! I'm in the wrong mode.\"  But until then learn your camera and experiment with it!!!  We have lost our share of one-time memories to pilot-error.UPDATE: 8/2011 My wife refuses to invest the time to learn some basic settings/adustments that would really improve her pic. taking results BUT that is not the cameras fault!

This came in handy when i was buying a car in mexico where I now live.

The car was in direct bright sunlight and I could see nothing useful on the camera screen, nor was it possible to read the sticker. I used the viewfinder to take the shot. Despite the sunlight I got a perfect close up photo. I printed an 8x10 on plain paper and all the print on the sticker was clear, sharp and legible.The second time it suprised me was when I used the video.My wife and I are professional musicians and often neeed videos. We usually hire a pro to shoot our videos and record the sound with pro equipment. A client in Asia needed a video in a hurry. I had bought a second SD1200 cheap on Craigslist and we set up both cameras on stands.I also set up a pro recorder and mic for the sound as the sound on video cameras under $1000 is usually poor. To my suprise the sound from the Canon recording was nearly as good as the pro recording and we were able to use it which made editing a lot faster. Also the sound and picture quality from the two cameras were identical so we were able to edit the two together.

The new camera meets or exceeds my old one's performance -- at 10MP, it takes excellent photos, and with face recognition and the image stabilization feature, I rarely get a photo I can't use. I especially like the red eye fix removal feature/filter since my old Canon did not take care of this pesky problem well at all. Now, I rarely get the red eye problem. Good job, Canon. The placement of the memory card in the battery compartment is a little annoying, but certainly something I can live with. I bought an extra battery to switch out when the original one ran low. But, that hasn't happened yet. I appreciate the inclusion of a charger. Others I tried may have been better in terms of pixel depth, but it's a small sacrifice to go to 10MP when the camera comes with an essential charger.

Wide aperture photography in reasonable lighting is where this excels, such as shooting portraits indoors or in shade. Unfortunately, the size of the camera means some very strict limitations in the conditions under which you can get good photos. The aperture at high f/# (i.e. when the aperture is stopped down to let less light in) is so small that you get noticeable diffractive blurring. Take a picture in landscape scene mode outside on a sunny day (which stops down the lens to increase depth of field), for example, and you'll notice a certain fuzziness to the picture due to the small aperture.Another problem area in the camera is in the auto mode. For reasons I still haven't figured out, while the camera seems to do a great job picking out the correct mode (i.e. portrait versus outdoor), the results in auto are almost never as good as if you just leave it in P (program) mode. For some reason auto mode usually results in overexposure and too high an ISO setting. This is especially true when using the flash. I'm guessing that the camera errs on the side of having too much light to work with, rather than underexposing, but the results are frustratingly poor compared to what you get with P most of the time.Despite the photo quality limitations, many of which are unavoidable on a camera of this size, this is a very nice camera. As they say, the best camera is the one you have with you, and the compact stature of this camera means that more often than not, this will be the best camera. You'll almost always get good shots, and sometimes you'll get great ones, just using the auto mode. If you know what you're doing, you can get surprisingly good results from this camera. In summary, while one should be aware that sacrifices have to made in the optics with a camera this small, this is about as good a camera as you can get at this size.

I got this because my sister-in-law's camera takes great pictures and I wanted to get the same camera. Since I dropped my camera, I have been using her camera and it does take great pictures ONLY if it's not dark and no movement in the AUTO setting. I remember it taking better pictures when it was newer. So now I'm glad I did return this camera. It's really sad that I can't find a good camera that is 10 mp, bc I don't want to go much higher in mp when I don't have that much space in my computer to save such big picture files.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Last of a dieing breed", "Author": "Jeff Scott Olson", "ReviewID": "R13UJO9YNKUJPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not just the last Canon pocketable point-and-shoot digital camera with an optical viewfinder; as far as I can tell it is the last such model of any brand available for anything near the price.

I sent the camera back and explained everything, and GLR Recovery was very responsive. Their supplier that does their refurbish work sent them a bad batch evidently. I had a pressing need for the camera with an upcoming family event, and they would have had difficulty getting me a replacement in time. So they simply sent me a brand new (not refurbished) camera of the same model and for my trouble refunded the full price I payed for the refurbished camera.

I currently own a Canon Powershot sd800is and I love it.  Perfect pics & videos, excellent battery life, durable, no issues whatsoever.  When my daughter saved her money up for a digital camera I really didn't look much farther than Canon because I wanted her to have a great camera.  Since the sd800is is no longer available we picked the updated version, the sd1200is, which has more mega-pixels and zoom than my old one.When it arrived, we charged the battery and began taking indoor pictures.  They were very blurry and they had a yellowish-orange glow.  (We even had one that showed a blue & green orb floating by my staircase. STRANGE!)  I tried adjusting the settings to fix the issues, but nothing worked.  I'm not a camera expert, but I understand what most of the features and menu itmes do.  I have used them on my sd800is with much success.  I had my husband and his brother (both are smart techy guys) work with the camera.  Still, we could not get it to take clear pictures.  When I tried to take pics outside they came out virtually white, completely overexposed. My daughter tried taking some pics and did have success, but only if she took them in pitch darkness with the flash on.  They were clear and sharp with good color.  They looked like they had been taken with my old camera.  But, how practical is a camera that only works in the dark???I called Canon support and they took me through the same steps I had already tried, finally suggesting that I ship it in for service.  They were very friendly, helpful, and professional, but they couldn't replace the product, only service mine and return it to me in about 3 weeks.After considering my 30 day return window with Amazon, I decided by the time I would get it back from Canon, if I wasn't satisfied, I wouldn't be able to return it.  So I declined the Canon service and simply returned it to Amazon, which was also a very simple and painless process.We ended up spending less than half as much on a Polaroid t1031.  It doesn't have all the cool features the Canon has (no video either), but it does have image stabilization, a rechargeable battery, and the greatest part... it takes good pictures!  And she has some money left in her pocket so that's a good thing as well.I won't say, \"Don't buy a Canon\" because I love my old one and the features and customer service are great.  I will say, \"Don't be afraid to return it.\"  Most of the reviews are great, but sometimes you get a lemon like I did.

But the picture was perfect, which I made sure to show them! Im sure I converted several people that day and they will be getting one of these cameras too.Another low light situation is when I take photos for online selling.

The size of the SD1200 is bigger than SD1000 and a bit clunkier, but it is still compact enough for your pocket. On/off button is more difficult to press, as it is not indented like the SD1000. That has caused the loss of taking quick, spontaneous photos a few times. The SD1200 has a selector button for going quickly from manual to automatic settings, which is an improvement. The ISO 1600 manual setting on the SD1200 is much better than the one on the SD1000--perhaps because of the added feature of \"image stabilization\", along with the improvement of pulling ambient light in dark situations. I would have to sit the camera on a very steady surface before, in order to get nice, ISO1600 photos. The SD1200 blows the SD1000 away in this area. ISO1600 photos now appear to almost be shot in daylight. Very nice. One very bad engineering feature is the auto \"scene detection\". Often, the SD1200 will auto choose micro, people or other.

I had suspected to achieve only \"adequate\" pictures with a camera this small.  I had thought that was the compromise I would have to endure for choosing such a small camera.  But, in fact, my outdoor photos were outstanding!  I was able to magnify the photos many times with my photo editor before quality digression started to become evident.  I'm not sure even my hefty Canon DSLR can surpass that effort. I intend to make comparison tests under similar circumstances with both cameras to satisfy my curiosity.THE BAD:  The pictures taken indoors were not as impressive. In fact, they were downright disappointing.  It was difficult to believe I was using the same camera for both indoor and outdoor environments.  I took comparison photos inside my house. I turned the flash On and Off, adjusted the ISO and varied the Theme settings, jumping from the \"A\" to \"P\" settings mostly.  The results were consistent.  They were all blurry. Perhaps the subject was beyond the range of the flash.  But then I would expect the picture to be underexposed, not blurred.  And I would have expected the pictures to be rock-steady with the image stabilizer, especially when you consider the fact that some ambient daylight was entering the room. I intend to address the ISO, flash and theme capabilities further in an attempt to improve the quality of indoor photos. But I shouldn't have to endure this aggravation.  Until or unless I resolve the situation I intend to restrict the camera's usage mostly to outdoor use.THE TINY:  As frequently mentioned by other reviewers the camera is indeed small.  But what did they expect?  The camera dimensions and other specs were provided by Amazon and other vendors.  The inconvenience of operating its diminutive controls are, in my opinion, more than offset by the portability of the camera. I do find the On/Off button to be particularly small, though.  I am considering sharpening my fingers with an electric pencil sharpener in order to access this button and others more easily. (Yes, I'm kidding).As for that \"flimsy\" battery door, what did they expect for a camera this small?  How would they suggest they make the door sturdier within that frame without making unacceptable compromises?  I could think of no practical alternatives.  Also, In spite of the many complaints of the \"flimsy\" door, I have yet to hear of any door failing.  Just don't abuse it.In conclusion, a fine camera for the money if you don't intend to use it for indoor use.  I found the controls to be more intuitive and comprehensive than many other cameras in its class.  And Canon is one of the last manufactures of Point and Shoot cameras to offer optical viewfinders.  At first I had intended to keep this camera stored in my car should unexpected photo opportunities arise.  But now, considering the quality of the pictures under certain circumstances, I intend to carry it more often for planned photogenic opportunities as a realistic alternative to my hefty DLSR.

After dropping and jamming the control motor on my 4 year old Kodak Easy Share, I was excited to upgrade because there were some issues that bugged me about my old one, like slow shutter speed and certain limitations in settings and quality.  I was SURE that a new camera would solve these problems. I bought the Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS camera on short notice before a trip after breaking the old one.. At first I liked that it was 10 megapixel and my kodak was only 4 or 5. I also liked its small size, and I have always had a lot of faith in the Canon brand. I also loved the speed of taking pictures.. It seemed very promising, but I am so disappointed! My 2006 era Kodak that cost 60 dollars on clearance was far far superior to this one, which I've spent probably twice as much for.Immediately during our trip I realized that the camera takes extremely poor low light pictures..(as a side note, I very rarely use the flash) They are grainy and the color is never 'true'. I have messed around enough with the settings in the last several months to know what I am doing, and nothing matters. Changing ISO helps many blurry picture problems, but, image quality in anything but very well lit conditions is terrible. In good light conditions, this camera tries to adjust for contrast between light and dark objects to the point that surroundings are either  too dark or washed out. I have adjusted about everything I can think of and this still happens. I have even gone into the manual color settings and turned the contrast down, and it only helps minimally. Wherever sunlight hits, its washed out. If you focus on the sunlit areas or the sky, everything else will be too dark to see.Also, I failed to realize before I purchased this camera that its settings are barely as customizable as the Kodak's. This camera does everything it can to think for you..and it's very annoying. There are very few manual changes I can make. I am not a professional, but I know a little about exposure times, ISO and F Stop etc. This camera does not allow you to even do basic 'real' adjustments. On the kodak, I could do up to 8 second exposures manually, which I would use on a tripod for things things like moving water, simple night exposures or lightning.  I have yet to find a setting on the Canon that lets me do more than a couple seconds. You might say if I want something more advanced to get a DSLR, but I don't want to carry around something the size of a DSLR. What's more is that I know very well that point and shoot cameras can be made compact, and have manual settings and great quality without being a DSLR. The newer the camera the worse quality they seem to be. How disappointing, Canon!

I opted to buy a less expensive replacement, the SD1200.  It wasn't love at first sight.  The camera worked well enough, but it lacked manual controls, the picture quality wasn't great, and, frankly, I never truly warmed to it.  After about six months of moderate use, I turned it on for the fifth time in a single day to discover that the lens wouldn't operate properly -- the fatal \"Lens Error, Restart Camera\" message was displayed on the bottom of the screen.  Judging from the number of websites/chats devoted to this problem, it seems to be fairly common -- not just with Canon cameras but with all compact point and shoot cameras (although it certainly never happened with the SD800).  I did some Web research and found that Canon Service/Repair isn't really an option because of cost.  So I tried the various remedies posted by a number of others with the same/similar problem, pretty much in order of damage risk (battery in-out, tapping, banging, etc. etc.).  My last action (more of curiosity than anything else) was to take the cover/shell off the camera in hopes of dislodging the lens, which i imagined was stuck, but this, too, failed -- although it was interesting to see what one of these marvels looks like on the inside....I haven't given up on Canon (I still am the happy owner of a Rebel XSi), but I'm now thinking of buying a more upscale compact (like the S90 or S95), which should give me the performance (and then some) that I miss from the now-outdated SD800.

I was careful with it, never near sand nor a beach, never in the rain, kept it in a case.  But 5 months later it would not power on, or when I would finally get it to turn on, it would extend the lens and then power down, an even more frustrating situation.  I sent the camera in to be repaired while it was under warranty.  I then received an estimated repair cost of $118, claiming that it was water damage.  Again, the camera was never in the rain, never dropped in water.  To my knowledge it was never even damp.  If ambient humidity may have caused the problem that is certainly a design flaw and this camera should only be sold in the desert.  I had read online that Canon repair had done this same sort of rip off with others and somehow thought that as I knew I'd treated the camera well that my case would not be the same.  I am greatly disappointed and will never waste my money on a Canon camera again.I was extremely disappointed with the durability, or lack thereof, of the camera even with proper care.  I was even more disappointed with the outrageous repair estimates that was not even explained by the repair service.  As I have seen that others have had the same experience and now learn that one of the cameras I'd given as a gift did the same thing, it is interesting that on Canon's own website the reviews are so glowing.  This may have been how I was led to believe it was a good camera in the first place.

I did a ton of research before buying it and I still think this is the best option.

It shouldn't be this hard!

By the time I make the adjustment, I've missed the picture. I could show you side by side shots of a gorgeous sunset taken within seconds of one another with the iPhone and the Canon and there is no doubt that the color and focus on the iPhone shot is better.HOWEVER, if you want a digital camera to carry in your pocket, and last forever, this is the one to buy.

Like many here, I owned an earlier version of the Powershot  (purchased in 2006) and loved it. When it was irreparably damaged I looked no further than buying another Canon. Suffice it say I'm disappointed in both the overall picture and its cumbersome controls. This all became abundantly clear when I took some candid shots at our family annual picnic. Nearly every shot looked just out of focus -- like I was photography everything using a Vaseline lens! When I compared to the shots with ones I took at last year's event with my old Canon Powershot  I was shocked. Under what looked like similar lighting conditions, I had almost 60 crisp, clean pictures.  I'm not asking for a lot from a point and shoot, but when Canon obviously has the technology to produce a fine camera why mess with it, and I do expect posed pictures taken in broad daylight to be in focus. I've also noticed that the auto focus sometimes takes a while to lock in, but even when I wait that extra second I end up with blurry pictures.Also if you take pictures at night or under low light you'll get an orange tone to your pics unless you set the camera to an indoor setting. Don't forget to switch it back if you move outdoors otherwise your pictures will have a blue hue. I've had such bad luck using the Auto feature that I use Programmable mode almost entirely and have had better success, but so much for ease of use. The camera is also useless in locations where there are hanging lights (like a patio), neon lights or street lights. You will get a major lens flare, sometimes obliterating your subject matter entirely, and I have not yet figured out how to remedy it.Shall I say something nice? I love that there is an option for 10 mega pixel shots (using the large setting, which I recommend). The battery has an exceptionally long life compared to my older Canon. There have been a few times where I had forgotten to recharge and was able to take pictures 2-3 weeks later. The compact size is nice. It really does fit into your pocket or a small pouch in a purse.  But the picture quality is a huge problem.

I've owned several other digital cameras previously and for this trip I wanted something inexpensive, small, and reliable. For my intended purposes, this camera worked very well.Start-up time is under 2 seconds, so I was able to quickly whip out the camera and take pictures at a moment's notice. Compared to other Canon cameras I've used, this one is noisier than most as it constantly refocuses in auto mode. While the mechanical lens motion noises may be slightly noisy, this probably helped to reduce the time needed to compose a shot when I lightly pressed the shutter button before taking a shot. The 3X optical zoom worked well, and digital zoom is also available at the expense of image quality. The built-in flash is small, and not useful at distances farther than 10 feet, but that's typical of very small cameras like this model. The optical viewfinder is nice, if you'd like to take pictures in low light, where you might want to use the high ISO night mode, but I would suggest a tripod in those cases. The face-detection worked well for taking group photos, and the new \"Digic 4\" processor in the camera seemed very fast for all features included. Speaking of features, you won't find things like color replacement in this model, probably since it's aimed at the simpler point & shoot market. Advanced users may note that at the time of writing this review, a CHDK is not yet available for this model. Battery life is quite good. For the average user, you should be able to take pictures throughout the day and evening before needing to recharge it at night. Picture quality was good, and the easy user interface is up to par with typical Canon excellence. The camera is small enough to fit easily in a pocket, but the metal body makes it feel fairly rugged.The green color is attractive and stands out from the typical silver or black digital cameras most people have today.

I'm a little sad that the old batteries no longer work with this one, but I can see that they're trying to make the whole thing smaller, and the batteries aren't terribly expensive.Remember that you need to buy a storage card, it's not included!  Amazon offered a 2Gb Kingston card for free when I bought mine, a good deal and I haven't filled it up yet.With this camera and Adobe Lightroom, I feel like I can take gorgeous photographs without the expense and inconvenience of lugging around an SLR, although I would totally do it if I had the money!  I find myself making fewer adjustments in Lightroom with this camera, which I attribute to both the camera and my skills improving over time.One more thing that's kept me coming back to this camera over the years is the Canon Hack Development Kit ([...]) which is a third party open source firmware project that allows you to shoot in RAW, and do a lot of other fancy stuff.

(which is plenty enough. trust me. any higher and you're just throwing your money away), long battery life (I went to italy for a month and snapped over 200 pictures before it showed low battery), takes awesome pictures (so sharp-even with motion, and looks even better on your computer), and it's easy to use. Comon, WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?! BUY ONE ALREADY!For people who aren't intersted in switching modes for everything, It's as simple as this... Use the Auto mode (The small button, pushed to the top) when its very dark and you need a flash, like in a bar/club or outside patio Yatzee! tournament(hey whatever floats your boat). Use the Manual mode (The small button, centered) when it's in the afternoon, like at a soccer game or something, and you don't want a flash. That's it. Now if you want to take advantage of all the modes this camera has to offer....

This one came so highly rated, I was really looking forward to having a newer, better camera. I have had the camera about two weeks now and am VERY disappointed.Now, let me preface this review by saying this is for the user who is looking for a simple point and shoot. With my previous Canon, I never got around to reading the manual; the \"automatic\" setting resulted in plenty of good pictures. All I ever needed to adjust was occasionally the flash. With this camera, that is not the case at all. The quality of the pictures in the automatic setting is VERY disappointing; far worse than with my previous camera (which was only 3.2 megapixels). I take a lot of pictures of my 12-month-old twins. With this camera, most of the pictures are blurry--pictures which would have turned out fine with my old Powershot--and many of them are very grainy. Video quality is decent but unremarkable. I will get out the manual and learn the settings to try to understand how to take decent pictures, but I am really disappointed that the automatic mode is such a dismal failure compared to the older model.EDITED: My SIL told me to try playing with the flash settings. I did, and I'm not even sure what changed but I no longer have the problem with pictures being blurry!

I liked the first two a lot, mostly for shooting outdoor nature shots in very bright light, but really liked the IS on the 1100 for shooting in dark canyons, etc.  I find many more of my pix are good (not blurry at least).But these cameras have problems with the lens gears - just google \"canon lens error\".  I've had this on all my cameras (have not taken the 1200 in the field yet).  I use them outdoors in places with very fine sand, but I keep them clean and in bags, never drop them.  Now the 1100 fell onto a rock from 6 feet so I take blame for that, but I'm really disappointed in the lack of robustness - in fact part of the reason I have so many is that I won't go out into the field without a spare.  Note that if they die within the first year, Canon graciously repairs them under warranty, as long as they don't look too beat up.  And you often can get some more life out of them once the error starts by pushing the lens back so it is level - but the gears are plastic, they are wearing out all the while, you can hear grating noises.Nonetheless, I thought I have so many batteries and chargers why not stay with the family and I got the 1200.  Sigh I was so disappointed that it has a different sized battery.So I've just jumped over to the Lumix ZR-1 as my most recent camera.

I agree with some reviewers that the viewfinder is pretty much worthless....no one is going to look through the viewfinder...why even bother. The controls are fairly intuitive although I miss having a printed manual to have as quick reference for the many options offered...it's certainly not convenient to have to refer to the manual on your computer. The number of manual functions is extremely impressive and I  have yet to experiment the all of them. The results in Auto mode are excellent for casual use but the manual settings do give you a tremendous amount of control over your final results. I have yet to print any 8\"x10\" or bigger prints but can see that the amount of detail in the photos will certainly hold up to enlargements. Canon's photo software is garbage....just download Picasa..you can't beat it for free!!! I've shot some videos with the SD1200IS and they aren't too bad...not HD but quite passable with decent sound. To think I paid $400 for my S110 8 1/2 years ago and only $149 for the SD1200IS.

What are you thinking, exactly?  Why does \"not perfect\" rate a \"perfect\" rating?It's small.  The metal body is nice and feels sturdy.  The plastic door for the battery/card is absolutely pathetic - feels like the cheap cheese it is.  It wouldn't be so bad, I suppose, if it weren't:- right on the corner (it's going to take a hit and break)- right where you hold the camera (it just feels so cheap and gross!)And, of course, it takes crap pictures.  I want a point and shoot that takes decent pictures.  What, exactly, is wrong with that, anyway?  What, exactly, is so hard about that, anyway?  I want to take it out of my pocket on auto mode and be able to take a good shot - from the hip, in under a second.  I have children - things happen very quickly.  Pictures come out fuzzy, over exposed, under exposed, with terrible colors, with vertical light streaks, completely out of focus (the auto focus is incredibly lame and slow - it does a complete out and in on the lens every shot.  Who designed this thing, anyway?).  Pathetic.  Then there's the lens assembly.  Golly, it looks EXACTLY like the one that failed on my other PowerShot (which also took crap pictures).  I'm not happy with Canon, that's for sure!On the plus side, the LCD is good enough on this one that you can see/tell that your pictures are crap (as opposed to the SD770IS where the pictures look good on the little screen so you only take one or two.  Then...  When you download them...  Boy, aren't you ever bummed that they're just GARBAGE).Glad I bought myself the equivalent of a micro 4/3 - I get awesome pictures every shot and it's pretty close to pocket-sized.  This...  This isn't any better than a throwaway 35mm camera.  Take a ton of pictures!  Maybe that way you can get one that's decent enough to print (small format, of course, 'cause there's no way it will ever take anything decent).", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Skip this one and get the SD1300 or SD1400...", "Author": "PeppermintPatti \"Gina\"", "ReviewID": "R18Q9R0AV4CNEJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was very pleased with the SD1100 with 8 MP, but thought I could get even better 8x10's and larger prints with more mega pixels.

I think that my main complaint is that the flash never worked and since most of my work involved daytime hours, I didn't notice this until the warranty ran out. Now I just use it for everyday shots and short video. I will admit that it is very sturdy-it took a fall on concrete and sustained only minor scratching. I've never dropped a camera before so I don't know how this would compare to others but I suspect that it fared well. I intend to upgrade to either the newer SD1400 or whatever comes next. Canon quality is awesome. Don't want to penalize Canon-I believe that I just got a lemon this time. My advice would be to research the newer versions of this camera.

Monte", "ReviewID": "R3B8QN9595LLZ9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this when my Sony Cybershot died. After weeks of researching, I decided on this camera. It seemed you can't beat it for the price. I'm an amateur photographer and my main camera is a Canon Rebel Xti DSLR. I wanted a camera to put in my pocket when I don't feel like lugging around my DSLR. Here's the good and the bad of this camera, I've had for a few months now...Pros:-Great, amazing, crisp Macro shots! This camera rivals my DSLR for Macro quality, beads of water on plants, flowers, food, etc. anything close up and this camera shines.-Outdoors this camera takes great landscape photos. Even at night, given you use a tripod this camera has great infinity detail.-Compact and slim enough to fit in jeans pocket.-Battery life, as with all Canons, is amazing. I'll use it for almost a week straight without needing a charge.-LCD is great, very vibrant, too vibrant I think, pics aren't as contrasted as it makes them look, but great nonetheless.Cons:-Flash is really harsh! So bad to where it's almost unusable indoors at night. My last camera had an option to adjust the flast either + or - one setting to adjust it's strenghth and I almost always left in on the minus (-) setting. If this camera had that, I'd give it 4 stars. It's so harsh that I'm considering a Gary Fong diffuser for it and permanently attaching it to it. It just blows out subjects, especially in Macro, forget about it.-Zoom is glitchy. The zoom constantly isn't smooth. It'll catch as I zoom in or out periodically and stall as I hold down the zoom switch.-It's very slippery. This camera has a very smooth finish and makes it easy to slip out of your hands. There's nothing to grip ontom it's all one smooth surface.Conclusion: This is a great camera for outdoors and macro shots, but indoors suffers, as most point and shoot cameras do, with a harsh flash. I'd look for a camera with an adjustable flash level because all digital camera's flashes by default are too bright and harsh for indoors. For $150 though, you can't ask for too much from this little camera...", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "camera not so great", "Author": "Carolyn Nelson", "ReviewID": "RG8XBDNC45RGO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wasn't very impressed with this camera.

I can't believe they are talking about the same camera I now own. The image quality is consistently bad in almost all lighting conditions, and horrendous in low light conditions. It can take good pictures indoors in macro mode with the flash, depending on what the subject is.Images are consistently under or over-exposed, and even both in the same image. I returned my first camera thinking it was defective, and got a replacement from another retailer. However the poor quality of the images and the test results I got from both were consistent between both cameras.When taking landscape pictures outdoors in perfect lighting of trees with clouds in the background, the trees will usually come out as underexposed, blackish blobs even if they are not in shadow, while clouds will usually be just formless, blown out white blobs. Forget about taking pictures in snow, which comes out as a formless white mass with little texture. Rusty tin roofs on barns = blown out white masses in most shots. I have taken hundreds of pictures and 90 percent of them are horrible, the rest mediocre. Only 1 percent could be rated as good but again, it depends on subject matter. Mind you my standard of comparison is my old 3mp Canon S230, Canon's el cheapo camera of yore, and with which I took over 15,000 excellent photos without playing with the controls.Despite the 10 megapixels, zooming on on images in an image viewing program beyond the default pixel depth reveals fuzzy and grainy images. Oddly, I can zoom in further with my 3mp S230 images before I see image degradation than I can with this thing.Problems seem to crop up any time you have dark and light subjects in the same frame. The camera will darken the darks and lighten the lights, while taking pictures of the same objects separately may yield good results.I wish I had good advice as to which camera to buy, but definitely avoid this camera like the plague.

It was a very windy day and as I was taking photos the camera shut down.I attempted to turn it back on, but kept getting a lens alignment error.After 83 photos the camera was dead because a strong wind knocked the lens out of alignment.I contacted cannon and they were of no help at all.  All I could get were the standard canned responses from support.No one actually addressed my dissatisfaction or offered a solution.  (Canon is in Europe also)So I went on my trip with the Panasonic FX150.  Got my pictures back today and as my wife noted they are not very good.  The FX150 randomly takes a nice photo, but most of the time they are overexposed or out of focus.  Yes you can blame the photographer, but no matter what you do with the FX150 it has a mind of its own and you don't buy a point and shoot camera to be messing around with manual settings on vacation photos.The bottom line is I would not recommend this camera due to its build quality.
