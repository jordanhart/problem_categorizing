Has a lot of the features of the Canon DSLRs.[2] You can edit the pictures within the camera (color, cropping, filters)[3] HD video recording is awesome.[4] 14X zoom plus 56X digital zoom.[5] GPS[6] Trigger shooting with smile or wink[7] Mini HDMI out put[8] Many modes to choose from. Tv, Av, M, P, Portrait, Landscape...just to name a few[9] Adjustable shutter up to 1/3200[10] Adjustable ISO from 100-3200[11] HS and IS makes this thing worth the money[12] Menus are easy to navigate (because its similar to the Canon DSLRs)[13] The mode selector dial goes all the way around without stopping.[14] Too many to list...Cons:[1] Get your finger off the flash. The location of the flash takes a little to get used to[2] Battery life is terrible[3] I have big hands so it's hard for me to grip it.[4] Aperture is only F3.1 wide open[5] Flash charges slow, but is decent for a point and shoot (I'm so used to my Canon 430 EX ii speed lite on my DSLR)[6] Shutter speeds of 1 second or longer is limited to only ISO 100.Final Thoughts:[1] Canon makes some of the best Cameras if not the best. You get a lot of the DSLR technology compacted into this little thing.[2] If this camera had a F2 Aperture like the Canon S95, it would be Canon's best point and shoot camera released to date, but there's a trade off when you want zoom. Both cameras are neck and neck in my book with the S95 edging it out by a hair because of the F2.[3] The biggest difference between the SX230 and SX220 (UK) is the GPS. Why isn't there a SX220 in the US? If you feel like importing one, it's about $80 less.[4] Love this camera so far.  If you have a Canon EOS camera, it will be a sinch to use. I didn't even read the manual. Otherwise, if this is your first time using features like Tv and Av mode, then you'll want to read a book. [5] The price is just right, but could be just a tad lower. You get a great feature rich compact camera for this price. Don't get fooled by the touch or dual screen cameras. They are only gimmicks. If you don't want to carry around a huge DSLR, this is the one for you.[6] This camera is for my wife to replace her crappy Sony Cyber Shot. I own a Canon 7D.[7] The pros clearly out weigh the cons and there are really no deal breakers in the cons so if I were you, I would stop reading reviews on this camera and just buy it.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Avant garde performer, low light champion.", "Author": "NJ's dad", "ReviewID": "R109X1RU3LY39I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have canon sx210-IS for almost a year now, but when my baby spilled water over it, it stopped working and the cost of repair estimated by Canon repair service was costing me almost equal to a new sx210-IS price, that was when I decided to buy this upgraded version from Canon.Most of features of this camera were also the part of its predecessor, but let's focus on the new features which make this one better than its' predecessor:-*Low light support: This is the most talked about feature, and this was be one of 'THE reasons' I chose this camera and it really worth a pat on back for this . The results are really amazing for a point and shoot category camera.*Super slow motion video: The results are really awesome. It is amazing to see my baby; flipping her hair and running, trying to catch a butterfly - in super slow motion! I should say that the slow motion option with 240 fps is for brightly lit places; otherwise the results are not that good.*Full HD video: This definitely is an improvement over sx210 is, which can only shoot 720p videos. This makes the video quality of sx 230-HS exceptional.*GPS tracker: It is a nice to have feature. I used it once but, this sucks the battery so I keep this option off, all the time.Other features worth mentioning:-*14x zoom: It is really amazing how they are able to put 14x zoom in such small body. It is worth mentioning the fact that these super zooms are only effective if they come with automatic image stabilization feature and let me ensure you that this camera as its' predecessor - sx210, does this job exceedingly well.*12 mega pixels: Although SX 210 has 14 mega pixels but I would not consider this as a degrade. Too many pixels packed in a small camera, do not do any good to image quality (though my wife still considers this as a degrade, can't help)*The low wait time: Between two shots is definitely an improvement over sx210.*Battery life: The charge drains out fast, so would advise you to have a standby battery with you if you are planning to go out with this camera. This was the main reason I did not give it 5 star rating.Conclusion: I would recommend this camera to all of you who are not satisfied with the image quality of your camera and are looking for a camera which gives nice indoor image quality, specially under low lights. I am using this camera for almost a month now and I am loving it and also bought a hard case for it this time :) remember...Edit:Suggestions-* Wish I could edit, and upload my pics and videos online, straight from the camera thru wifi.* A camera mode to capture time lapse videos, a feature similar to the one provided by some of the iPhone/iPad apps.I know I am asking for too much but my assertion is, if a free iPhone app can do this then why can't a decent canon camera?", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "First Canon with GPS", "Author": "Jeff W", "ReviewID": "R2GW9KOMC8D07T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a replacement for my Canon SD800IS, where I was very interested in getting the new GPS capabilities.  I also have a professional camera with my Canon 7D, so this is more of a family/trip camera.Overall, I'm very happy the photo quality and manual features offered (control over exposure level, aperture setting, flash level, etc.)  Having a single button to shoot video is great.  However, the battery life is much shorter than my old camera.  I'm getting around 200-220 photos (instead of 600+), with a few videos thrown in, per battery with the GPS feature turned on.  Buy an extra battery.  For the GPS: it takes about 1-2 minutes for the camera to lock on the satellites once outside.  I think it's cool to see exactly where you took a photo and this will be neat for vacations (wish I had it for an Italy trip a few years back).I recommend this camera for anyone needing a super zoom with GPS.  Just note the slightly bulky size and need to carry an extra battery.Pros:*Excellent daylight photos*Very good inside photos w/o a flash, for a compact camera*GPS feature generally works well, photo locations show fine in Apple Aperture*Zoom works quickly and they finally show a screen indicator for the zoom position*HD video works well*HDMI out is handy, but the cable is sold separatelyCons:*Battery life is not great with GPS on (about 200 photos/battery).  The low battery indicator starts flashing red pretty early (with 25-30% left), so that could be a pro or con.*Camera is bulky compared to my old SD800IS, so get a case that will hold it.

Dowd", "ReviewID": "R1BU1QF0EK5TK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use a canon g12 as my travel camera and for special occasions but I wanted a smaller camera to carry with me every day in my pocket or briefcase while not traveling. I find the G12 to be superb, indoors and outdoors, in bright or dim light. It is very sharp, the optical viewfinder is helpful for action shots, and the articulating screen make unobtrusive waist level photography easy.I find the sx 230 weighs about seven ounces compared to the about 14 ounces of the G12. The G12 is very sharp but the sx 230hs  is almost equally sharp indoors and outdoors. The zoom control on the sx230 is far smoother than the one on the G12. Photos seem perfectly exposed, in sunshine and in rain,  and in artificial light. The long zoom is more useful  than I thought and are quite sharp at all focal lengths. It is even quite sharp  at maximum zoom if the shutter speed is set at 1/125 seconds or faster. The menus of the two cameras are similar so it is easy to switch between them.I discover from the internet that it is perfectly okay to keep a finger pressed on the popup flash so it doesn't pop up when you don't want it to. From what I read, this doesn't hurt the flash and it removes an annoying design flaw.I have tested it extensively against the Sony wx9 on still photos and find the sx 230 hs to be considerably sharper and have more consistent proper exposure.I find the sx 230 hs access to aperture priority and shutter  priority and exposure compensation to be major assetsAll in all, I like this camera very much and recommend it for someone looking for a compact digital camera. I am planning to use it as a take everywhere with me camera. I have found that cameras that are even smaller, like the sony wx9 and the canon elph 300 hs are too small to be ergonomically confortable.Hope this helps with your decision.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera but somewhat flawed", "Author": "Mr Todd", "ReviewID": "R3L9XW6X5R13GM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon needs to stop putting these weak little batteries in thier cameras!  It's just not fitting!  The SX230 HS sucks up power from that small battery like a drunk at the end of prohibition!  They use the same battery that comes with the SX210 IS and it was insufficent on that camera.  The SX230 HS is even more power hungry if you are using the GPS for geotagging.  I was thinking about taking this camera to Africa with me but I have serious concerns about its rate of power consumption.  I may need to three batteries insure I have atleast one that is good to go at all times.The GPS is sometimes a little slow to aquire a fix outside and offers a rare treat if it picks up your position inside.  The indoor GPS performance is well within what I expected.  If GPS is on your A list of requirements, Panasonic models with thier built-in geolocation database is better.  The GPS implementation is sort of a tack on that Canon put little extra effort into.At the end of the day, the SX230 HS is a camera so that's the most inportant thing here.  The images are good.  I was mildly surprised but it will never replace a Canon S95 (which I do have).  The 12MP SX230 HS seems to retain about the same level of detail as the 14MP SX210 IS in low light conditions at ISO 800.  I also own the SX210 IS. The SX230 seems to be slightly more light sensitive but seems to have more agressive noise reduction than the SX210.  The SX210 preserves detail at the expense of more noise.  The SX230 also seems to suffer more from color de-saturation at ISO 800 than the SX210 IS.  If you think the GPS, faster burst frame rates, full HD and cleaner look at base ISO are important, the the SX230 HS a worthwhile upgrade. Go for it.  Otherwise, there just isn't enough newness here to jump on.I would say that I'm generally satisfied with the SX230 HS and it competes well with other cameras in this segment.  Not everything is for everyone.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Performance!", "Author": "hkwan", "ReviewID": "R297QMSG0ERJ2J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few weeks and spent some time with it in various conditions. I used it at a wedding, going rock climbing indoors and out, at a paintball field, and at night photographing fireworks. My impression so far is that this camera has the most flexibility in a point and shoot I've seen yet. The low light performance is really impressive; I can only imagine the S95 would be even better with a full F-stop wider lens. However, I have to say that the long lens on this SX230HS has really been more useful on multiple occasions. It's just fun to be able to get closer in certain conditions like on the paintball field or shooting details on buildings, or getting close up to the bride and groom, or even closer up shots of fireworks.It's not the most ergonomic camera ever; I'm sure you'll read about the flash positioning and small controls.  The pop up flash is fine since 95% of the time I don't use flash. I simply hold it down while I turn on the camera and it's out of the way. But when I do need it, I have to turn the camera off and back on; a small inconvenience. The size is on the edge of being too big and heavy for a \"back pocket\" camera. I use a small neoprene bag with a carabiner clip. The LCD is beautiful, but the image frame is smaller than the whole LCD to make room for control displays; a little deceiving but it's high resolution makes up for the size.Some of the other controls take some getting used to; finding the manual controls and many modes. With that said though, the features of this camera are GREAT. Tons of diverse shooting features that meet all average user needs. There is an \"easy shoot\" mode which I find myself using if I am in a rush for a shot. I didn't find the problems one of the reviewers had with consistently blurry shots at all; when I put it on easy mode, pictures were crisp in most condition unless there was a ton of movement; at that point you're simply limited by physics... not enough light and too much movement = blur. With that said, my low light shots are exceptional for a point and shoot. I was so pleasantly surprised with fireworks.I don't really do videos but one very difficult video I did take in very low light very far away was jittery and the color was off. But in normal light and distance it's fine.Lastly, the complaints about battery life are totally valid. To give you an idea, I ran out of juice from a full charge from mid morning at the wedding to the beginning of the reception. I shot about 150 pics but kept the camera on a lot, zooming in and out. HOWEVER, I got a recharge and it does do that quite quickly. I would buy at least one if not two spare batteries for long trips with no power availability like backpacking or 3rd world travel.Anyway, this camera is really good enough for me to buy a second one as a gift to my brother. If you want a high end point and shoot that's still small enough to carry around in a jacket pocket, this is a great choice.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Point N Shoot", "Author": "Lotus-Seven", "ReviewID": "R15FN1UZDKLG44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The features of this camera are well described on its spec sheet and on the Canon website.Purchased it as a replacement for an A-710 which was my wife's \"purse camera\" until it was lost.The SX230HC is a definite improvement:  It does have higher sensitivity, higher resolution and a wider zoom range.  The images are reasonably noise free up to an ISO of about 400.  The flash range is short, but decent for group shots up to about 10 or 11 feet away.  Auto focus is fast and  accurate.Like many small cameras, the close focus distance (in macro mode or not) is dependent of the zoom setting.  At the longer focal lengths, focus is limited to 1 Meter and at the shortest focal lengths, it's limited to 5 cm.  The close focus limit is displayed on the viewing screen as focal length is changed.The lens is quite sharp at the wide angle to to moderately long zoom settings.  However at zoom settings of between 40 and 70 mm (the maximum for this lens) it becomes pretty soft and looses contrast.  Image stabilization is quite good (around 2.5 stops), with mid zoom range images of stationary objects possible down to 1/8 to 1/15th. sec hand held.  Because of its small size, and the location of the pop-up flash, this is not an easy camera to hold, however, with a little practice one can adapt to it.  Using the wrist strap is essential if you don't want to drop this camera!My wife's biggest complaint is the view screen. Indoors in moderate light it's fine, but outdoors in bright sunlight, it's difficult to compose a shot, especially of a moving or sports scene.  Our \"old\" A-710 had an optical viewfinder that was much better (in daylight), but today its almost impossible to find a low cost pocket camera that includes one.Some owners have complained of short battery life, but we're getting around 200 shots without flash or 120-140 with flash.  Considering the small size and light weight of the battery, that seems more than reasonable.  My wife always carries a couple of charged batteries with her, but very seldom need to change the battery.Summery:  A decent \"pocket\" camera capable of recording excellent images in medium to bright conditions at most settings of its zoom lens.  Good, but not outstanding battery life, weak built-in flash (typical of cameras this size), and viewfinder that is not great in bright sunlight.

I purchased this camera to replace a Panasonic Lumix ZR1.  It had great reviews, but I was never really happy with the picture quality, especially indoors and in low light settings.  I wanted a camera that would take quality pictures, with a nice set of features (doesn't everyone?).  I'm a novice at photography but want to learn more, so I wanted some manual controls that would allow me to take good shot right away, but also to grow into the camera as I learned more.  I think I found a winner.Photo quality is excellent.  With all of the different shooting modes, it is very easy to take great shots.  Colors are accurate.  Indoor shots have turned out great, often times without need of a flash.  The camera has a CMOS sensor, touted to allow better low-light shots and it seems to work brilliantly.  Outdoor shots have been excellent as well.  If you're a novice, make sure to learn how to make use of the white balance settings.  It makes a huge difference in the overall coloring of the shots.The user interface is very intuitive and easy to find things, and I had grown comfortable knowing how to access most features within an hour or so of first using the camera.  I also like that a brief explanation of each scene mode appears the screen when you scroll to it.I haven't used the video camera very much, but have found the video clips that I have taken to be very decent.As far as negatives, it is difficult for me to find many.  Many reviews bring up the flash position as a problem and it is annoying when the flash won't pop up because your finger is over top of it, but it's easy enough to pull it up manually.  The battery life isn't great and a spare battery may be needed with heavy use, but for casual shooting probably won't be a huge drawback.  The camera has GPS, which is hard to locate in the menu screen and doesn't seem that useful to me, at least not yet.  I've kept it turned off for the most part, because it will drain the battery.  All of these are minor flaws and don't take anything away from the greatness of this camera in my mind.No camera is perfect, but I think most people purchasing this camera will be happy with their decision.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not the Canon \"perfection\" I'm used to", "Author": "bythecshore", "ReviewID": "RJT9OFAAV9I9U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really psyched to get this camera, as I've had several Canons over the years and know they make great cameras.  I'm used to being delighted by them but was a bit underwhelmed with this one.Don't get me wrong, it takes great photos, has great build quality, but there are a couple of glaring problems.First is the flash.  Although I've had the camera several months, I still can't get used to the little pop up flash that wants to open under my finger.  It's just in the wrong place, period.Second is the GPS, one of the primary reasons I bought this camera.  Having used GPS functionality when taking photos with my iPhone, I was excited by the possibilities of geo-tagging all my future photos taken with a \"real\" camera.  But I've been disappointed.  The GPS takes a long time to acquire a satellite, and indoors almost never does.  I'd say about 1/3 - 1/2 of my photos overall are tagged (10% indoors, 60% outdoors).  This is particularly disappointing seeing as how my iPhone does it 100% of the time.My last camera was a Canon 1100IS, and the photo quality looks about the same.  That was a great little camera.So - on the plus side, this camera takes very good photos, is feature-laden, has an excellent 14x optical zoom, and great low-light capabilities.On the minus side is the very mediocre GPS sensitivity, battery life, and flash placement.

I am a semi-pro photographer, depending on your definition, (I sell fine art photos and have done various venues and head shots). I was looking for a high-zoom camera that was pocketable.  I looked at them all, as I always do, and after having had several in the past that I found sub=par, I bought the SX230, mostly on recommendations on Amazon.

I had been researching travelcams for over 2 years, trying to save the money to purchase one and waiting for the right travelcam to come along. When I began research in earnest again a few months ago, I was thrilled to see how much they improved this camera over the original SX200IS. I spent hours and hours researching the top rated travelcams and then I went out to stores and held them in my hands before deciding on the SX230HS.This is my first Canon camera. My previous digital cameras were a Minolta and then a Panasonic Lumix FX07. I loved the compactness of the Panasonic and many other features about it, but was always disappointed with the low-light performance.Now that I have my Canon, my 8, 9, and 10 year old daughters use the Panasonic. When I upload the photos from the two cameras after weddings or family events, there is no comparison between the two. The Canon is such a big improvement over the Panasonic in image quality, especially in low-light.I purchased an extra battery, because, as many other reviewers said, the battery life is short. I just keep the extra battery charged and have not run out of battery power.I have found the Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card works great with this camera. My one problem has been that now that I have this camera, my computer is too old. I can't use this flash memory card in my computer or in my personal photo printer because they are too outdated. The card works fine in my sister's newer laptop computer, though, so I know that the problem is my outdated computer and printer. Sigh. I still can upload pics to my computer easily, however, by using the camera's USB cord. And I can still print pictures on my PictureMate because I just copy the pics to my smaller 2GB card in order to print them.The Pretty Hot Pink rooCASE is the perfect size and color for this camera. The outside pocket holds the extra battery and an extra memory card and the whole thing is still small enough to easily fit in my purse. I love color coordination, and I love how the camera and hot pink case match. I also have a hot pink and black gorilla-pod that matches perfectly, too. I know you guys reading this review are probably gagging by now, but my girlfriends reading are saying \"Hey, hey, hey.\"I also purchased a mini HDMI cable for $35 so that I can watch my pictures and movies on our HDTV. I love the quality of the movies. I am glad I can play them on my TV because my computer is too outdated. So beware - this camera is going to end up costing more than I expected as I now realize the need for an updated computer!!!Since I would like to expand my photographic skills and learn how to use the manual controls more, I bought BetterPhoto Basics: The Absolute Beginner's Guide to Taking Photos Like  a Pro by Jim Miotke. I just finished reading this book cover to cover and now want to go back and practice the exercises he suggests for expanding your photography skills. I found the photos in the book helpful and beautiful and his instructions clear and concise. I've already had some positive comments on photos I've taken that were a direct result of using his tips.I printed the owner's manual and put the whole thing in a 3-ring binder. You definitely need to read the manual if you want to be able to use all of the features this camera offers. By choosing the option of printing 4 pages to one 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper, and printing it front and back, the 212 page Camera User Guide and 62 page Software Guide didn't take up nearly as much paper and fit easily into a 3/4\" binder. I am still working my way through the manual and learning new things about this camera every day. Although it is easy to use right out of the box and fairly easy to navigate, there is so much to it that it takes time to learn it all. I am glad I got the camera months ahead of my trip to Spain so I can become totally comfortable and familiar with it before attending the family wedding there.I can't comment on the GPS because I haven't even tried it yet and it wasn't why I bought the camera anyway. If they had carried the 220HS in the USA I would  have paid a little less and gone without the GPS.I always keep the camera on the 3:2 ratio setting as that corresponds to the 4x6 photos I print the most often.I am still working through the manual, but some helpful things I learned by reading it:You can brighten the LCD without navigating through the menu system by holding down the display button a few seconds.You can turn the clock on by holding down the function button.You can review your pictures without having the lens pop out by holding down the function button while pushing the power on button at the same time.You can mute the sounds on the camera by holding down the display button while pushing the power on button. To turn the sounds back on you have to go into the menu system.I still have much of the manual to work through, so I am sure I will discover other fun things as I go along. I haven't tried the slo-mo yet and haven't really worked with color swap either.The main reason I wanted this camera is I wanted a big zoom in a compact camera and I wanted great image quality. I love the zoom. I love the portable size. And I have found the image quality to be a big boost over my previous digital cameras, especially in low-light. I am hoping that as I learn and grow as a photographer my image quality will improve even more.I would definitely recommend this camera to others.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Looks to be a winner for vacation pictures.", "Author": "bevorules77", "ReviewID": "R1Y99HC9N6SUDF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to the UK in June for two weeks, so I wanted to buy a new camera.  Like many people, I was debating between Canon's S95 and the SX230.  I chose the SX230 for the following reasons:-- ZOOM!  Many photographers claim that zoom is overrated, that you should always \"zoom with your feet\".  That's good advice, but think about those times when you're at a crowded tourist attraction and you can't get right up to your photographic target.  Sometimes you may want to take a picture of something really high up.  Also, it can allow you to achieve the illusion of closeness in your shots without disturbing the scene.-- 1080p video with optical zoom.  S95 has 720p with digital zoom only.  Most people won't need a dedicated camcorder if they get this camera.-- Picture quality.  Yes, the S95 has the best picture quality, and that f2.0 lens in low light can't be beat.  However, the picture quality of the SX230HS is very good, and the high-sensitivity sensor makes up for a lot of the shortcomings of the slower lens.  If you're upgrading from an Elph that was made 3-4 years ago, you'll be really impressed.-- Size.  Where else can you get all of these benefits in such a small size?  It's not that much bigger than an S95, though it's significantly larger than some of the new Elphs.  However, I don't need a featherweight camera.  The SX230 fits in most pants pockets or in a belt case.  I use this one:Caselogic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black)-- It's made in Japan at an actual Canon factory.Now for the downsides.-- Battery life isn't as good as my old SD950IS, even though it uses the same battery (NB-5L).  For my vacation I'll be taking the battery that came with my camera, the one from my old camera, and another one that I just ordered from Amazon.-- The location of the popup flash doesn't bother me too much.  However, it tries to pop up every time the camera is turned on, and I wish that it would pop up only when needed.-- Focus speed could be a little faster, but it's not too much a problem if you half press before shooting.  No point and shoot is going to be lightning quick; for fast action you need an SLR.-- Auto Mode seems to favor ISO 400 in the dark, even with flash enabled.-- It's a little pricey for a point and shoot in 2011.  Normally I would wait for the price to go down a little bit, but I wanted the camera for my upcoming trip in June.It's not #1 at anything; the S95 has better image quality, the SX30 has more zoom, and the Elphs are smaller.  However, I don't think you're going to find a better mix of features in this form factor.Update (9/2/11) -- This camera was definitely worth the money.  My UK pictures were really good for the most part.  Sometimes it would blow out the highlights, which is a common problem with most point and shoots; try lowering the exposure compensation if you see that happening.  The indoor pictures that I took at museums and pubs were surprisingly good; I maybe used the flash 3 times on the whole trips.  My friend dropped my camera from about 3 feet onto concrete -- aside from scratches on two corners the camera survived!  On the other hand, the metal on the front of the lens is thin.  The camera was in the front compartment of my carry-on bag, and the bag tipped over on top of it.  The metal bent, and the lens covers wouldn't open anymore.  After bending the metal back into place, the lens works perfectly again.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful pictures are worth the price", "Author": "Mama Unicorn \"Ruby\"", "ReviewID": "RRQGRWLHO7QZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a mother of three young children, so most of the pictures I take are of running kids inside the house.  I'm also not skilled at all in photography.  I've had three digital cameras before this one (one Nikon and two Kodaks), and I'm quite certain I'll remain a Canon customer from now on.The downsides of this camera are as follows:1. You must protect the front of the camera; the metal around the front lens is very delicate.  My husband dented it even though it was in a case in his pocket, and he only sat down at the computer.  When it was dented, the lens covers wouldn't retract.  I used a knife blade to carefully flatten some of the dents, and it's worked normally since.2. You must also learn to hold this in a different way so the flash pops up.  I looked at the instruction manual and it showed me to hold the camera in the nook between the extended forefinger and thumb of my left hand, with the forefinger along the bottom rather than up the side, and I've found this provides a much sturdier hold anyway.3. This doesn't have a dedicated sports setting, which I miss enough to mention, but not enough to curse the camera.4. Sometimes I've missed a picture because maybe I don't press the button long or hard enough.Now, on to the positives:1.  The flash is great.  Even in low and artificial light, it doesn't always use the flash, but the pictures turn out great.  It doesn't wash people out, and it manages to capture what they really look like.  I hated pictures of me taken with my old Kodak because I looked bloodless, but those of me taken with the Canon 230HS show me as the living, breathing person I am. I appreciate that.2. The Auto setting works very well. It accurately transitions from a Macro setting for taking pictures of my kids' drawings, to snapping one of them pulling a face, to taking a beautiful picture of the moon outside.3. I love the dedicated Video Recording button.  It does have a Video setting, but why rotate the dial when I can just push a button?4. This is important: It has a fast processing speed.  It takes almost no time to take a picture, record a video, and take another picture.  My old Kodak had a 10 or 15 second delay between each of those settings, and it drove me mad.This takes pictures quickly, but you'll probably find you won't need to be taking picture after picture like I used to try to do because the Canon 230HS just plain and simple takes beautiful pictures.  In other words, I've found I take fewer pictures now I've got this camera, because one good picture is worth 10 mediocre pictures.This camera was expensive for me, but it is worth the price.  It works well in low light, takes beautiful pictures, and works quickly.  I strongly recommend it to others.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "A wonderful camera", "Author": "John Diaz", "ReviewID": "R1SZJX4BHE8SKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is probably all you need to know regarding my review of this camera. I bought this camera a month ago, took many satisfying pictures with it, then took it on a kayaking trip where it got water damaged and was unfixable. So...I bought another SX230HS.Here is my backstory. I owned a Sony Cybershot DSC-W80 for several years which I loved very much. Unfortunately, I got sand in it, and that was the end of that camera. So, basically, I am only a point and shoot user and that is all I want a camera for. To take snapshots to document memories and infrequently blow up a picture or two. I do happen to take many photos and videos in low light conditions at concerts, so having a camera that could turn in decent shots under those conditions was important for me in addition to at least a 5x zoom.I did almost as much research as I did before I bought the camera the first time, thinking maybe I'd missed something, and maybe I might opt for a different camera the 2nd time around. Well...for the things that I wanted - very good photo quality, very good point and shoot low light photos and zoom while using the movie function, this camera achieved more check marks in my \"pro\" column than any other camera. I compared it to the Canon Powershot ELPH 300HS, Sony CyberShot DSC-WX9 and Sony CyberShot DSC-HX5V. I'd been looking at a Panasonic Lumix too, but after using the panorama features of the Sony and the Canon, I struck the Panasonic off of my list because that became a must have as well. I also looked at the Sony Cybershot DSC-HX9V too, but I'll confess, it wasn't at either store that I went to to look at cameras and was rated behind the SX230HS in terms of photo quality anyway.For the negatives that have been reviewed about the SX230HS, they are well founded in terms of shooting performance, limited battery life and lackluster GPS capabilities. However, none of these points are important to me. As far as the battery, it really wasn't a problem because one of the first things I did after buying the camera was to buy several more for backups. You can buy them relatively inexpensively on the internet. I can understand if they prevent others from buying this camera. I haven't really experienced any other \"cons\" with this camera, however. It is significantly bigger than my Sony Cybershot DSC-W80. I'm not totally sure this is a con, but it has involved getting used to it. I'm a bit paranoid that while shooting with one hand, I'll drop the camera...but that hasn't happened yet, and I doubt it ever would happen. Here is my rundown though:PROS:--Zoom of 14x (I still think 14x is probably too much, but at times it has been helpful.)--Photo quality (There has been a marked difference from my Sony Cybershot DSC-W80. It takes truly wonderful pictures)--Low light photo quality (This was very important to me. The camera has not disappointed here.)--Movies (The movies have come out really well. Granted, the movie capability on this camera isn't as good as the Sony Cybershot DSC-HX9V in terms of frames per second, but I have had no problems. The stereo sound is wonderful too. Being able to use the zoom in movies is invaluable for me.)I will say, that the tiebreaker for me to buy this camera over the other models I was looking at was the hope that I could take better advantage of the capabilities of this camera over time. Meaning, because I'm just a snapshooter stuck in auto, I could have done this with any of the other cameras I was looking at and saved $100 and probably have been happy. But with the SX230HS, I am hopeful that if I can take advantage of some of the manual controls of the camera, I can get even better photos, eventually, than if I'd just stayed in auto. To me, this was a worthy tradeoff and worth the $100 since I plan on using the camera extensively. I almost never go anywhere without my camera.CONS:--Slow shooting performance. It is fairly slow, I'll say that. Especially in dim lighting. That will take me some getting used to, but if the tradeoff is very good photo quality, I think that it's more just a tradeoff than a Con. I put it here though only because I simply still need to get used to it.--Limited video length. On an 8gb SD card, I can only take 29 minutes of HD video. This probably would never be an issue, but at a show, I want to make sure I have a surplus of space. This fact will probably lead me to get a 16gb card eventually so I have more than enough space. Is it really a con? I doubt it. But it is an issue for me.--I haven't read this anywhere, but the protruding lens has given me a rare issue once or twice. Stupidly, I dropped it into a bag once and it either hit keys or something else hard and dented the plastic around the lens. I had to go to a camera repair shop and they quickly fixed it, but it was very disconcerting. That obviously wouldn't be an issue with a camera with less of a zoom.--The flash pops up each and every time you start the camera. This is definitely a Con. Is it something that will prove to be extremely annoying? I can't say. Right now it is simply slightly annoying. Only time will tell if repeated pushing down of the flash will damage it. I rarely if ever use flash, so we'll see.I'll try to update this as I grow more comfortable with the camera. But ultimately, if you're looking at the same cameras I was, or are looking for a point and shoot, this point and shoot is hard to beat. It has a higher ceiling than many others priced around $200 which have limited manual controls. I may not even use the manual controls on this camera much...but it is nice to know that if or when I try to, I can.So, if I love this camera, why did I only give it 4 stars? Good question. Part of it is I'm not completely sold as it is...I don't think any camera could ever be perfect for me. I'd actually have probably given this camera 4.5 stars. For one, it is too expensive - it doesn't need to be $100 more than some of the other outstanding cameras I was looking at. 3 others were $200 and I'm not sold this camera is that much better to be at $300+. The flash is another slight deduction. Also, Sony gets it right with the iSweep Panorama feature on their point and shoots. The Canon does ok with the Stitch Assist and is very easy to use with software with practice. But it isn't as nice. Still...I'm thankful it has it. The point of all of this is that I'm not completely sold I made the right decision with this camera as opposed to the other 3 cameras I was looking at. That said, I do really really like this camera a great deal and that is why I bought it AGAIN after damaging the first one that I bought. The other 3 cameras I looked at just didn't do anything to convince me to not buy the SX230HS either the first or second time.From a point and shoot, I want outstanding overall photo quality (relatively speaking with a point and shoot), very good low light photo quality (again, relatively speaking) and a healthy amount of zoom and this camera delivers.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "An excellent P&S;", "Author": "hkwan", "ReviewID": "R2Z3L21O7ZHOU6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a month and spent some time with it in various conditions. Weddings, rock climbing, Fireworks, at an aquarium/science museum. My impression so far is that this camera has the most flexibility in a point and shoot I've seen yet. The low light performance is really impressive; I can only imagine the S95 would be even better with a full F-stop wider lens.But, I chose this over the S95 because of the longer zoom. Some might argue that you should just walk up to your subjects and I agree to some extent... unless your subject is in a wedding and you can't exactly stroll on up to the alter, or you're trying the snap a picture of that cool gargoyle on the roof edge.. Or you're on the sidelines of a paintball fire-fight and you don't want to be a statistic, but you still want to capture the fear in their eyes. That's where the 14X zoom won over the 2.8 F stop in the S95. I'll just have to live with grainier dark shots rather than completely miss some.It's not the most ergonomic camera ever; I'm sure you'll read about the flash positioning and small controls. The pop up flash is fine since 95% of the time I don't use flash. I simply hold it down while I turn on the camera and it's out of the way. But when I do need it, I have to turn the camera off and back on; a small inconvenience. The size is on the edge of being too big and heavy for a \"back pocket\" camera. I use a small neoprene bag with a carabiner clip. The LCD is beautiful, but the image frame is smaller than the whole LCD to make room for control displays; a little deceiving but it's high resolution makes up for the size.Some of the other controls take some getting used to; finding the manual controls and many modes can be an exercise in random button pushing. With that said though, the features of this camera are GREAT. Tons of diverse shooting features that meet all average user needs. There is an \"easy shoot\" mode which I find myself using if I am in a rush for a shot. I didn't find the problems one of the reviewers had with consistently blurry shots at all; when I put it on easy mode, pictures were crisp in most condition unless there was a ton of movement; at that point you're simply limited by physics... not enough light and too much movement = blur. With that said, my low light shots are exceptional for a point and shoot. I was so pleasantly surprised with fireworks. I think the HS sensor really lives up to its name.I have a few complaints about the camera; first the 14x zoom is great for wide range of usage but it also means that you have either Macro mode within a few inches), or a range of focus that's several feet away as soon as you do any zooming. It's simply the physics of the lens; the long zoom just leaves the closest focal length out. So, when I was taking closeups of things that are just within a few feet at the museum,, I have to move the camera right up on macro or step back; either way it's not always easy to zoom near field objects. Objects beyond a few feet are fine. I could have lived with a 7-8X zoom for some of that capability.secondly, the complaints about battery life are totally valid. To give you an idea, I ran out of juice from a full charge from mid morning at the wedding to the beginning of the reception. I shot about 150 pics but kept the camera on a lot, zooming in and out. To good things about this battery though; it charges pretty quickly and it's used across many canon cameras. I would buy at least one if not two spare batteries for long trips with no power availability like backpacking or 3rd world travel. I would also consider a battery charger to get both juiced at the same time.Anyway, this camera is really good enough for me to buy a second one as a gift to my brother. If you want a high end point and shoot that's still small enough to carry around in a jacket pocket, this is a great choice.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent zoom capability", "Author": "T. Sills", "ReviewID": "R2HHPOXBXF4ODK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As Julie mentioned in her review, there were a ton of reviews for this camera.  Not sure why they got dumped, especially considering the effort someone goes through to write them.  Here's mine from 10/22 regarding my experience with this camera.  At it's current price point, this is a great buy IMO.Review from 10/22/11:I waffled quite a bit on this and debated between the sx230 and s95. In the end, I think the two cameras are really entirely for different purposes and people. As someone who spent 15 years shooting with an all manual 35mm, I want the ability to manipulate the shutter/exposure on the fly. This initially drew me to the s95 with it's wheels and ring for quick manipulation. But when I stepped and asked what I really needed this point and click for...shooting kids' events, ease of use for wife, and compact size, I realized the desire to do full manual (or close to it) became less significant.Many of the same controls are available on the sx230, but they require some extra button pushes. You might ask why it's important to do the manual override, but sometimes achieving that great shot may only be an f-stop away. But for my wife and probably the majority of users, auto mode or shutter priority may be the next best thing.I picked this camera up a day before I went to the Porsche Rennsport Reunion at Laguna Seca. So I had to learn on the fly how to use it. With that said, here's my experience with it.Pros:- The telephoto range of this thing is 2nd to none. It closed the gap across very large distances and maintained excellent sharpness.- I thought the zoom was fast and reacted way quicker than my Panasonic DMC-zs3.- Light balance and metering handled very difficult lighting situations well. In some cases I was trying to shoot cars in garages what had brutally bright sunlight in the background, and the camera metered well off of the subject and didn't over react to the harsh lighting in the background.- One button push for video is very nice and makes it easy to cover photos and videos (as compared to other Canon models).- Video is very sharp (at 1080). And colors looked excellent (daylight video, didn't try evening/indoor though).- Small foot print when you consider the zoom range.Cons:- Battery, battery, battery- you have to manage the juice when shooting video or doing flash fills- very frustrating and something I've experienced with my other Canon point and clicks.- Focusing- digital photography is a numbers game to me in that it's easy to shoot a lot of shots knowing you'll get some winners. I found that the focusing was slow and sometimes hunted. I found myself needing to constantly pre-focus (slight press of the shutter button) to ensure it was ready.On the other hand, I only had a few throw aways, but these were still irritating.- pop-up flash- this is irritating to me in that it gets in the way when holding (or maybe it's just me), so when powering on if you have your finger over the flash area it won't pop up. So you have to manually flip it up when needed. I often do a fair amount of flash fill during daytime shots so I'm constantly going back and forth between forced flash and no flash. I guess you have to get used to just leaving it up.- no contoured body- I never felt like I had a good grip on the camera and wish it had a slight contour or bulge on the right side to make it easy to wrap you fingers around it. It has some weight to it, and I would've liked getting just a bit better grip of it. Even some sort of textured material/finish on the right side would have helped. Because of this, you'll see some extra camera shake getting through when at full zoom. So you need to really have a good posture and controlled breathing so as to not pass the vibrations through.Overall I think this is a fabulous camera that would meet most consumers' needs. The high quality video and long range zoom will probably satisfy most users' needs. Keep in mind that the penalty for that high zoom is the extra glass which will reduce the low light capabilities. I shot a few indoor pictures and they seemed to be ok, but I was having to quickly compensate by cranking up the ISO. If you find yourself shooting a lot of video, you'll need to for sure carry an extra battery. I hated this aspect as it limited my weekend's coverage knowing I had to manage it. Lastly, for kicks and grins I went and checked out the G12. While it give's a shutter bug the next best thing to a full on DSLR, the weak zoom and knowing the spouse would leave it in full auto mode made it a no go.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from Canon SD550, great camera!", "Author": "NexusOwner", "ReviewID": "RHTQ81VOBLWEN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon SX230 HS is a great camera!

I love that camera!  However, I do have a need for small point-and-shoot.  The 7D doesn't go everywhere with me.  Most of us know that the right camera is really the one you have with you when you need it!My goal in this latest camera purchase was to get a compact camera that takes great photos, even in low light.  I want to take quick snapshots of my pets and the occasional HD video when the mood strikes.  I also would like a camera to have a well-rounded set of \"fun\" options, like color swap and toy camera mode, and an exterior that can stand up to my dog's occasional game of \"eat the camera\".  Although I've only owned the SX230HS for one day, I can say with certainty that it holds up to a quick nibble from a hyperactive Shih-Tzu/Poodle mix who thinks he's a rock star.As for features, the SX230HS is chock full of them!  There is everything from \"Easy\" mode, where the camera sets all the settings for you and removes most of the information and icons from the screen, for a truly point-and-shoot setup, to full Manual mode, where you can set all standard shooting functions as you see fit.  There is also a nice array of preset modes, such as Landscape, Portrait and Night Scene, along with fun ones like Toy Camera, Tilt-Shift Effect and Color Swap.  Of course, this list isn't all-inclusive.  There are many great shooting modes to choose from and they are all easy to get to with Canon's usual simple (yet powerful) controls.But with all those neat shooting modes, they would be worthless if the picture quality wasn't any good.  Luckily, the SX230HS takes excellent photos all around!  I am totally confident in saying this.  The photos from this camera are excellent...FOR ITS' CLASS.  Of course they do not compare to photos from my 7D, or from any of the most recent G-series cameras, nor should they!  It is not reasonable to expect a $300 camera to perform at the standards of a $500 or $2000+ camera setup, even though a lot of people do make that comparison, and their reasoning boggles the mind.  If you want more from a camera, you are going to have to pay more.  With the SX230HS, you are getting a beautifully designed, great quality camera with lots of fun and useful features, (more than some people would probably ever use), that takes beautiful pictures, very good quality HD video (despite being only 30fps) and also tags your files with GPS information for you.Although I have only owned this camera for a day, I have done my best put it to the test.  I will say that battery life is shorter than most of the other point-and-shoots I've owned.  With the GPS on, screen on and using the flash in a little more than half my shots, the battery lasted about a day...through a little over 300 shots.  This is actually better than I expected after reading other reviews.  I will probably get a second battery, especially since I plan on using the GPS function, which really drains the battery.  When you register your camera, Canon will give you a coupon code for 15% off your next purchase.  You can use that towards an extra battery!A big selling point for me is the in-camera software.  The menus.  After all, you are going to be interacting with the camera's menus A LOT, especially if you like to play around with various settings in Manual mode, like me.  As usual, Canon has made the camera very easy to navigate with shallow menus that are organized logically, including descriptions of what most of the settings do right on the screen.  Oh, and it's a very nice screen, by the way.  Three inches of LCD beauty.  It's clear, sharp and displays colors very accurately.  I'm very happy with the LCD screen.  If you're not sure what a menu option does, or are having trouble figuring out how to do something, you can refer to either the included 34-page \"Getting Started\" guide or the PDF manual which is provided on CD.Now on to image quality!  This is the main idea of a camera, right?  To take good photos?  Well, the SX230HS does take very good photos!  I want to start out with the negatives. There are only a couple and for me, they are not that big a deal.  First is chromatic aberration.  With the lens wide open, it's noticeable.  The center of the lens is fine, but on the edges there is significant ca.  It's not terrible but it is noticeable.  Zooming in a little or stopping down seems to correct this significantly, and there are computer apps that can also reduce this for you if it's a problem.  I tend to zoom in a bit on my subject.  That is one reason I chose this camera.  Many compact zooms get very fuzzy the further you zoom in.  Not this one!  There is slight loss of quality, but nothing very significant.  To me, this more than makes up for the ca on the edges.The other issue for me is the quality of night shots.  Please note, the SX230HS takes excellent LOW-LIGHT photos...some of the best I've seen from a compact point-and-shoot.  But the night scene mode and its' performance in very dark shots isn't that great, in my opinion.  The photos came out more noisy than I expected and any warm, orangey tones were turned a greenish-yellow by the automatic white balance.  However, shots taken just after dusk, when there was still a degree of ambient light in the sky, turned out beautifully!  Using the manual settings at night was an easy work-around with good results.  There is also a fireworks mode and a clear shot mode, which produced much better night shot results than the actual night shot mode.  This makes me feel like the three settings are a bit redundant, but I would rather more presets than less.  The three modes are meant for three different things, but I think just two of them would suffice.  (Clear shot and Fireworks).  I don't think it would be fair to take away a star in my review for this, since the images are STILL better than most other point-and-shoots I have tried and manual settings demonstrate that the SX230HS is, indeed, capable of taking good photos at night, you just might have to work for it a little!  I think I am just used to doing nighttime photography with my 7D.  Not many cameras can compare to it's performance at night...and like I said before, the SX230HS shouldn't!  I am simply including this information in my review because I know I'm not the only one with a higher-end DSLR who's shopping for a compact point-and-shoot.  The results are good, but don't expect miracles!As for the real positives about image quality...automatic white balance (other than in night shot mode) was excellent.  Exposure was nearly perfect in most photos.  The fun presets like Toy Camera and Color Accent result in wonderful, interesting pictures of even the most mundane of subjects.  Portrait mode produces beautiful skin tones and smooth details.  Action shots come out clear and bright, with subject tracking working as accurately as it does on my 7D, which impressed me a great deal!  Also, macro shots are crisp with color that is properly saturated and no significant loss of detail.  Complex textures like pet fur look crisp and clean.  Overall, $300 isn't a big price to pay for what the SX230HS does.  Sure, it has a few drawbacks but they are nothing major if you're willing to at least dabble in the manual modes.  It handles the most difficult shooting conditions with relative ease and is small enough to take anywhere!I do highly recommend the SX230HS.  For most people, it is more than enough camera and certainly worth the money.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent, excellent.", "Author": "Elizabeth A.

For me, this is the combination of all things good: A fantastic camera that not only takes pictures, but makes sharing about the world easier. Where I'm from in the dirty South (New Orleans, LA), not a ton of people pick up one day and fly out to Syria. In fact, I'm the first in six generations to fly to another continent. When I got the camera, first thing I did was do a walk-through around the city. The geo-location tags were impeccable and the shots were... amazing. I tested out all the features - color specific, ISO increasing, multi-picture mode, you name it, Canon knows what they're doing. I tore down to my favorite wine shop last Sunday night, and for those of you who've seen \"Treme\", yes, Bacchanal does exist, just not in Treme, and through their backyard, lit only by a string of lights, I was able to take impeccable low-lit pictures without flash.

Do not expect image quality as you would find on a $1000+ DSLR package with a nice lens. If it did have that image quality, I'd feel really bad for paying so much on a DSLR. The image quality IS good though for a compact camera. The zoom is excellent and goes really far.I came from a Canon SD1200, and in some ways that camera takes sharper pictures in certain situations. But I grew tired of having no control. So I got this one and it has all the creative modes you'd find on a DSLR. If you don't know how to use these modes you are missing out on some cool aspects of photography. I quickly learned and am now enjoying using manual settings. At its widest setting the aperature opens from F/3.1 and goes up to around F/8.0...It's a nice camera for photography, but photography IS hard. Sometimes you need a tripod or your picture won't come out well.It has a lot of focus options like tracking options.Good low light options. Sometimes I can take a picture in a very dark room and it looks like it was in daylight.Of course it does have an auto mode and it takes good pictures.My favorite part other than the long zoom is that it has a lot of filters. For example color accent lets you keep one color and make other colors black and white.Actually my favorite mode/filter is the miniature effect that makes everything look like miniature toys. It also has a video mode for this too that takes only 1/5th or 1/10th or 1/20th frame so when you play it back it is super sped up.It also has a super slow motion mode which is neat for birds or insects.I love the color, blue...I am just a big fan of the customization on this camera for your pictures.The picture quality is nice. Zoomed in there is a lack of sharpness. But it's not too bad.

Made a lot of excellent shots.  Now, we're going to Germany, and I'll be damned if I'm going to haul all that equipment around.Purchased this camera after a lot of research.  Wanted the best camera I could get in a small form factor.  Higher-end cameras are out there, but they're larger in size than what I wanted: slim, light, small.  The SX230 fits the bill.Shot quality is good - better than I expected; not quite as good as my DSLR setup with a lens that by itself costs twice what this camera costs, but still very good.  Very little distortion even at the extreme ends.  No chromo weirdness.  No purple fringes at telephoto on fine details.Wide array of capabilities - beginners can shoot good pix, more learned users can make choices, advanced shooters can access lots of control.  The SX230 is a descendant of the good old Canon Powershot 95 by way of the SX 210, which is a pretty good lineage - the 95 was and is a workhorse backup to many a DSLR.  For that matter, the 95 is still an excellent choice and well worth looking into.PROS: Small, lightweight, excellent shot quality, HD movies, easy to access menus.  You don't need to study the camera to use it.  (I ruled out my second choice partially because it had a 'cheat-sheet' offered.) Auto, Program, and Manual modes are very good. It slips easily into a class 30 Lowepro case that fits on a belt.  (Somebody out there recommended a class 10; don't believe it.)CONS: Some reviews out there complain about battery life.  So what.  If you're a casual shooter, one battery is fine.  If you want to do more, get a spare.  If you want to shoot all day and do movies, get two spares. End of story.No RAW mode.  This camera is just below the price point that gets gets you RAW/TIFF format, but if that's a problem then you need to be looking further up the food chain anyway.The flash pops up automatically when the camera is turned on, which seems to really bother some people.  The flash is weak.  As stated, it pops up no matter what.  What's with this, Canon?  The camera does everything else well on its' own, but it just has to pop up the flash no matter what.  Maybe it matters.  Who knows?Allegedly, the back-lit CMOS sensor and firmware allow low-light shooting w/o flash in many cases.  I don't often do those shots so I wouldn't know.  The few shots I've done in low light were nothing to brag about.  Get a monopod or maybe a tripod if you want to shoot at the long end, either pix or moviesBOTTOM LINE:  I'm happy with it, more than I expected to be - the build quality is good but not heavy and the camera does what its' designed to do very well.  A larger grip on the right side would be welcome.  If you want more, pay more.  If you want less, then pay less.FEU", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon sx230 HS", "Author": "Cody Robinson", "ReviewID": "R1A2U5AC7FFJ0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon sx230 HS is a bit of a toss up camera.Pros:Great in low lightAbove average photo quality for a P & SGPS=Geo Tagging featureCons:Battery!

I've used Panasonic Lumix because of the advantage they had over other brands to provide high-quality shots in low light, which is one of the reasons to buy a particular point and shoot camera (or any camera for that matter).My other camera is a Canon DSLR, with expensive L lenses, so I am not a novice. However, this camera is used by both my wife, who is a novice and myself. This means I am familiar with photography in general, and Canon cameras on the high end. We wanted a point and shoot to take the camera places where the DSLR was just not practical (think Disneyland) and to be my wife's every day camera when the cell phone camera just doesn't cut it.Requirements: 1) full auto mode; 2) wide focal range; 3) fast shutter; 4) low noise in low light. The fact that a camera had GPS was a bonus, as we love this capability in iPhoto.The good:Full auto mode: the mode my wife shoots in. Excellent shots in both day light and low light. Simple enough that it makes all of the decisions for the photographer: variable focal point, auto ISO, the camera only fires the flash when it needs to. I actually prefer that, as I like photos to be in natural light as much as possible. The camera is also generally pretty responsive. The thing I hate the most about point and shoots is that \"wait\" for the camera to be ready to shoot. It's still there, just not as bad as I've seen before. Video is also generally of good quality at 720p.Manual modes: leave it to Canon to provide Aperture and Shutter priority modes! This is where I play on the DSLR, and I love the fact that it is there. Especially when I want to create that shallow depth of field look of an open aperture.The bad:The controls can be somewhat confusing, even for an \"expert.\" I discovered quite by chance that the selection wheel was more than arrow keys. It actually turned! Turning on GPS took me 3 days of shooting to figure out it was off! You need to manually enable the GPS locator. And then, when it is on, it only works when the camera is being used with a clear line of site to the satellites. It just doesn't work indoors. 1080p video is somewhat shaky and bad in low light. I'd stick to recording in 720p. You will need a large SD card to have plenty of room to record high quality video and stills (I ordered a 32GB card with the camera).All in all, probably the best point and shoot in the compact size and low price range today (summer 2011). A tad bit bigger than the Panasonics, but probably has the most complete feature set today.

Canon did a great job balancing noise reduction and fine detail. Lens distortions are not a concern, and chromatic aberrations are well controlled. An eensy bit of color fringing at certain apertures and focal lengths is apparent, but only when pixel peeping.The camera handles quite well, although it feels as though it could slip out of my grip a little too easily. The pop-up flash that annoys so many people is not an issue; the way I hold the camera to turn it on, my finger is already pressing on the flash. It didn't occur to me that I was keeping the flash from popping up until I accidentally powered the camera on while holding it one-handed. And went, \"Oh, yeah!\"If I could change anything about the SX230, it would be the LCD aspect ratio; I'd make the camera a wee bit taller and give it a 4:3 LCD. That's only because I have old eyes that don't see close up very well. Shooting in any aspect other than 16:9 results in a whittled down image on the display. Oh, and I'd make deleting pictures a lot easier. The way it is you have to go into the menu to erase pictures, and it's a four-step process.Bottom line: The folks at Canon have outdone themselves.

First, this is my 5th compact digital camera (my 3rd from Canon), I also have owned 2 Canon DSLR's: the EOS 30D and the Rebel T2i (my current DSLR).While I shoot better than 90% of my photos with my wonderful T2i, there are times that it is either impractical to carry the DSLR with me, or I just don't feel like lugging it around.  That's where the compact camera comes in to play.  Of the compact digital cameras I've owned, my favorite is still the old Olympus C-5050, it was a tank of a camera and a bit of a slow performer, but took some of the most beautiful photos I've ever seen.  It's taken 2 previous Canon compact digital cameras to get me to a point where I'm really impressed with one again.My first 2 Canon compacts were a mix of really bad and marginally OK.  The first model, a PowerShot A570IS, took OK photos, but performance and battery life were quite poor.  The second, an SD890IS Digital ELPH, I've used for the last 3 years and it's performed fairly well, but the performance in low light, the short zoom and the general quality of the shots left me often wishing I had my DSLR with me, or pining for my old Olympus.But Canon has made some strides in improving the quality of their compact digital cameras and this can be seen in the SX230HS.  At the price point, I'm very pleased with this camera.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it's got just a few issues that force me to leave one star off the rating.  Here are some notes I have on this unit, sorry it's a bit long-winded:Pros:1. Good low-light performance for a compact camera.  While the photos will be a bit grainy due to the smaller sensor size and high ISO needed for low-light, I am impressed at how well the camera performs indoors.  I've taken photos in places where previous cameras always fired the flash, this camera left the flash off, which led to a much better looking photo.  Again, it is a bit grainy, but I'd rather just get the shot.2. Decent flash performance.  Considering the size of the unit, the flash works well, actually better than previous compact cameras I've owned.  If you want a long-range flash, either purchase the Canon HF-DC1 accessory or buy a DSLR with a utility flash.3. Great video performance.  Having owned 2 Canon DSLR's, one with HD video, I can honestly say that I will likely be using this camera as my primary video camera instead of the DSLR.  Why?  First, the auto-focus is active during shooting, something that my DSLR can't do.  This is a huge issue because if I'm shooting a moving subject with my DSLR, I have to keep pressing the focus button, and the focus is pretty slow.  Since I'm not shooting feature length movies, the quality from the smaller sensor size in the SX230HS is more than adequate for what I need.  The sound performance during recording is quite good as well and they include a `wind screen' function/option to help quiet extraneous noise on a blustery day.  The biggest problem with this camera when recording video is the size, it's a bit small to act as a `stable' video platform.  This can be remedied by using a tripod or by learning to better brace the camera as you hold it.  Like all video, it's best to keep panning slow rather than darting around the scene.4. Focusing is relatively quick for a compact camera and the macro focusing works very well.  I really like that the camera display keeps you updated on how close you can focus based on the lens zoom length.  I've found this feature to be very helpful.5. Good overall photo quality.  Since this camera uses a smaller sensor, it's not capable of producing the quality of a DSLR, but I knew that before purchasing.  For a compact camera, the picture quality is quite good.  Colors seem to be accurate.  Exposure using the auto modes is surprisingly good.  Another bonus is that the automatic white balance seems to be very accurate as well.  I went from fluorescent to incandescent to daylight and everything looked very good.  As often as possible, try to keep the ISO under 400 for best results.6. Zoom lens.  This is the longest optical zoom I've ever owned in a compact camera.  For my money, it is a great investment.  While it does add weight and size to the camera, the trade-off is the ability to get shots I just couldn't get with a compact camera before.  The quality of the optics appears to be very good and the lens is fairly `fast' with a max aperture at the wide angle setting (5mm) of 3.1, not bad for a compact, and a big bonus for those lower light situations.  The zoom is quiet and moves in and out quick enough for me.  Just be sure to use a tripod or rest on a sturdy surface at the long end of the zoom to help ensure you get sharp photos.7. LCD display.  Bright, colorful and large.  No need to say more.8. Manual Modes.  I love this in a camera.  Full manual, Shutter Priority and Aperture Priority.  Depending on the shot I'm making, it's nice to have these controls available.9. Automatic Mode.  The automatic mode, which I'll use on the fly, seems to be very good at reading a scene and setting things up just right.  I've been continually impressed with the overall look and exposure of photos taken in Auto mode.10. Play Mode.  I came across this by accident, but you can hold down the `play' button to review photos without turning the full camera on and extending the lens.  This is a bonus to help preserve battery life.  I didn't realize my previous Canon compact had the same feature.11. Other modes readily available.  I like the decision to put the Portrait, Landscape and Kids/Pets modes right on the dial.  While I don't use them often, it's nice that you don't have to navigate a menu to get into these helpful modes.12. Build quality.  This camera is well made.  It feels sturdy and the lines and color (mine is black/silver) just look good.Cons:1. Size.  It's a bit larger and heavier than my previous compact digital cameras, but I knew that before I bought it.  The trade off for me was the longer optical zoom, which is worth the extra size and weight.  For comparison, it's a bit smaller in length and width than an iPhone, a little more than twice as thick and the two are close in weight, though I haven't put them on a scale to compare.2. Pop-up flash.  I'm not exactly certain why Canon chose to go this route, but I can speculate.  If you had placed the flash on the camera body in the usual location, the slightly protruding lens body would likely have caused shadowing of the flash.  It does take some getting used to - just remember to hold the camera a little differently, which doesn't take long to adjust to.  If you do forget and put your finger over the flash, it won't pop up when you turn the camera on; in this case you can manually raise the flash if needed by simply flipping the door open.  Canon provided a small tab on the door just for this purpose.  What I do now is rest the camera in the palm of my open left hand, then grasp the right side of the camera with my right hand.  My left hand, while not in the `normal' position for holding a camera, becomes a nice stable platform while not interfering with the flash.3. No hand grip.  The lens body already projects from the front of the camera, so why not put a small protruding grip on the front of the camera near the shutter release?  Sure this would mess with the nice Canon logo on the front of the camera, but it would make the camera much easier to hold, especially with one hand.  Considering that you don't want to cover the flash, your grip with this camera must be modified from what normally feels comfortable with a compact camera.  I think adding a small grip that protrudes no further than the retracted lens body would improve the design without affecting the overall size of the camera.  Combine the lack of a grip with the smooth (very nice looking) finish and if your hands are just a bit dry, it can slip right from your fingers.  Be sure to use the wrist strap!4. No RAW mode.  Since Canon appears to have aimed this camera at a market that includes DSLR users as well as casual users, it would be nice to have the ability to output RAW images for those of us that are inclined to use it.  I shoot RAW exclusively in my DSLR and would really appreciate having it available here too.  It really improves my post processing capabilities in Adobe Lightroom.  Unfortunately, this is one area that I see many camera manufacturers seem to miss out on.  There are a few select compact camera models that offer RAW out there, but they are usually expensive or lacking in some other area.  This camera would be over the top if Canon would add RAW capability.5. No optical viewfinder.  I've noticed many people complaining about this.  Having owned numerous compact digital cameras with optical viewfinders, I find them to be overrated.  Sure, it can be difficult to see the LCD display in bright sunlight (or if wearing polarizing sunglasses), but I simply have learned to shield the screen with my hand.  It's really no big deal.  On the cameras I've owned that do have them, since they're so tiny, I'd say I used them less than 1% of the time.As for battery performance, I can't say it's poor, especially compared to previous cameras I've owned.  Depending on how often you zoom that big lens and how often you fire the flash or even use the GPS function, your battery life will vary.  It could probably benefit from a slightly larger battery, though the NB-5L it comes with (the same battery my SD890IS uses) is more than adequate for the job.  I would suggest if you are out for a long day of shooting and want to be covered, do what I do and carry a second backup battery.Finally, if you can get past the minimal flaws in this camera, I think you'll be pleased with this camera.  Canon, in my opinion, is really getting the hang of the compact digital market.  With a few more improvements, this camera would be perfect.  Considering the current price, I would not hesitate to buy this again.Updated 12/6/11 - I removed one of my 'cons' as another reviewer pointed out the fact that this camera does have a quick way to access the video mode, rather than having to use the mode dial to get there.

My review will not be quite as thorough or in depth as others, but I still feel I should contribute my opinion! Most of the digital cameras I have owned over the years have been sub $150 Kodaks and whatever was cheapest at the time. With my main purpose for taking pictures being of friends and family events for Facebook, I didn't really need anything that great. Well, becoming a concert addict and just generally desiring a better quality picture than I'd been achieving previously, I turned to the hunt between Canons and Nikons, as well as some dabbling in the Panasonic, Olympus etc. Between the Canon Elph 300 hs, The Nikon S8100 and S9100, Panasonic something-or-others, I chose this camera. Mostly for the CMOS censor which helps in low light, and the super-zoom.Pros:Zoom is fantasticFull HD videoSmallGPS if you like that sort of thing (I don't really need this but the other version of this without the GPS costs MORE on Amazon...)Takes decent action picturesTakes decent low light picturesPop-up flash, doesn't create annoying shadowsThe screen is pretty niceIn-camera editingMany features and settings (low light, beach, foliage, kids&pets;)Other settings that can be tampered with on one's own (aperture, ISO)Cons:The battery life isn't THAT bad... but not great either. Buy a spare. Mine will usually get me through the day though if I'm not taking pictures every five seconds. Maybe 200-300 photos a day, depending? That's more than fine for the average person. If you plan to use this camera for festivities or concert events, bring an extra battery pack or two with you! You can get generic ones that work just as well for much cheaper than the name brand.Makes noises that sometimes concern me... I know that auto mode and autofocus can cause cameras to make clicking sounds.. but it's still something to be weary ofOn occasion it will not focus right... especially if it's a scene that has a LOT of light to it, i.e. fire, the sky... it can really wash out the colors, no matter what setting you're using. This is inconsistent, as it's not always a problem but it's a bummer when it happens. I don't really know how to explain this in camera-savvy terms, since I am as I said, nothing near a professional, which is why I bought a p&s; in the first place! :PGPS sucks out battery life super fast when you do use it.It could be a little bit faster.This is definitely a good choice for mid-ranged pocket camera, and I like my purchase overall. I would recommend to a friend.Update: I bought this camera in July of 2011. It's now February 2014. Within a year of owning the camera it started to have some issues. I get the 'busy' error message quite a bit, the lense doesn't open and shut all the way by itself, you have to manually press it open and closed after you turn it on or off, and the zoom toggle switch sticks which makes it hard to control. This was a great camera when it was brand new, but after a year it started to have a lot of difficulties. I barely use it now, to be honest. I do still like the camera more than its competitors despite the issues I've had. It continues to take high quality pictures and more than decent low-light video, so I would still recommend looking into it, especially now that it's cheaper than when I bought it. When I eventually bite the bullet and replace it (it's expensive for a point and shoot, but it does provide some pretty high quality pictures!) it will most likely be another Canon.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Like it so far...", "Author": "Jeep-PS", "ReviewID": "RTJ7J9Q73W0XK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Obviously not going to get SLR quality images out of a compact, but this one does well.

This is replacing a Panasonic FZ-28 for me, which was a lot bigger camera with 18x zoom. The lens is a bit smaller on the SX230, so the f-stop isn't quite as good, but it makes up for it with the MOS sensor, and gives pretty impressive shots in a wide range of lighting, though I haven't pushed it in low light or with the flash (I'm very happy with outdoor shots). There is a little bit more barrel distortion at the wide end than I am used to, I'll probably try shooting a little bit zoomed in to avoid that.The flash popping up every time you turn it on is a little bothersome, I typically forget and have my finger there so it can't pop out. So far the mechanism seems designed to tolerate fingers, and you are able to open and close it manually.

Planning to use whatever I bought as a backup camcorder, I watched a lot of videos created by these and numerous other cameras.  I also looked at many photos users had taken, and read a plethora of buyer and pro reviews.  Of those two topping my sub-$200 short list, it seemed the Canon ELPH maybe had a slight advantage on photos.  The Sony was looking a little better on videos, except I was concerned its audio might be more susceptible to clipping at concerts and wind noise outdoors.About the time I was ready to buy the ELPH, the Canon SX230HS dropped into my price range.  After studying it for awhile, the evidence suggested it should produce results at least as good as the ELPH, with the added benefit of a big zoom in a small case (and one not as noisy for videos as, say, a bulky Fuji super-zoom).  So, it really wasn't a difficult decision to go with the SX230HS at that point.  I was fully aware from the reviews that battery life wasn't going to be great, the flash was in an awkward spot, and that there would be a learning curve before getting the best results.After receiving the product, I first charged the battery and then tried to install it, which wasn't as intuitive as I'd hoped - it took a few minutes to figure out how to open the compartment and a few more to get the battery locked in, all the while hoping I didn't break something.  Probably, it was just me, and there were no further problems after the first time.  I did get the memory card inserted from the start without issues.On the initial battery charge, I snapped about 150 photos and recorded several short video clips.  At least one-third of the pictures were taken with flash, and the GPS may also have been on for about that many.  This all occurred in three separate sessions over a few days (with the camera turned on continuously once a session began), and total time was likely about an hour and a half before the battery died.  That's not great, but should be fine for my usage pattern.  I bought a couple of the cheap spares in case I ever need to extend my daily shooting time.The main difficulty I've had thus far is in knowing when and how to control the flash.  As someone mentioned, you can get yellowing under certain circumstances.  For example, I would get good colors on the main objects in the foreground, yet the off-white wall in the back would sometimes have a yellowish tint.  This seemed to happen primarily when shooting indoor objects that were within a few feet and fairly well lit already.  Auto mode was firing the flash anyway.  I switched to Program mode to stop it, and this gave better results.Having the flash active for well-lit objects at greater distances didn't seem to matter as much, and I also got true colors using the flash when there was very little light (usually had to hold the button down a second before it would fire, though).  I should note that Kids/Pets mode appeared to work reasonably well outside, but there was some trouble with the flash slowing it down inside.  Non-action outdoor shots were fine when using Auto mode, other than I may need to experiment on the settings for using wide-angle on drab, cloudy days (the pictures were pretty, but may have been automatically color-enhanced).  Extra zoom is nice to have, and the pictures seemed pretty sharp, even when going beyond the 14x optical to somewhat over 20x total.  You may want to steady the camera against something or use a tripod for the higher zoom levels.Overall, maybe 80 percent of my shots have been fine, and I have a good idea of what went wrong on most of the rest.  I'm still learning, but this camera seems to be pretty much what I expected, so I'm pleased.  While it's possibly not the best at any one given feature, it seems capable of doing many things very well, making it a well-rounded choice.  I do want to test the video aspect more before commenting on that, but if it's as good as in samples I've watched, without draining the battery excessively, that will be icing on the cake to have a camera that can compete with some low-end HD camcorders.  A little practice and experimentation seems to go a long way with this unit, so that's how I intend to continue approaching it.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent compromise - especially at this price point", "Author": "E", "ReviewID": "R2ARGKFDWEFPK4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wrote this review a few weeks ago. All reviews got moved for some reason, but now the camera is offered at $100 less than what I paid for it, making it a very good deal indeed.I got this camera after returning a Sony HX9V - and I am very happy with my choice. I still think that the Sony HX9V and Nikon 9100 run the Canon very close, but this is the best choice for me. One major criticism of the Canon is that the GPS doesn't work well - I don't use it, so no opinion. What I really wish is that Canon had offered the SX220 - the same camera without GPS - in the US! Here's what I like about the Canon:- Great value - now about $100 less than direct competitors.- Excellent image quality (with the exception of purple fringing)- full manual control, PASM modes (one of the main reasons I replaced the Sony)- Intuitive layout, responsive controls (especially if you've used Canons before)- Good focal range (though less than competitors)- some fun modes: I like toy camera, fish eye and color swap as toys. The high-speed video is very cool, but lo-res (VGA), which is fine with me since it's a gimmick I won't use often- good screen quality- decent low light performanceThere's things I don't like as well, though.- battery life. It's pretty weak, and the reason why I originally got the Sony. Luckily, batteries are cheap online.- the flash is very weak, and only illuminates the closest subjects. EDIT: not as weak as I thought. You can adjust flash power, but turning it up DECREASES flash power, turning it down increases it.- the flash always pops up when you turn on the camera, and it's in an inconvenient place.- the screen is 16:9 ratio - great for video, not for pictures- the video quality is ok, not great (24 frames/sec in full HD, no refocus while shooting)- deleting images takes too many button presses - a delete button would be helpfulUltimately, I think the Canon is great because of the image quality and the manual options. If you know something about photography, you will get more out of the Canon than out of the Sony or the Nikon. However, if you want a straighforward point and shoot, the Nikon is almost certainly better (though that has issues with long range autofocus and stabilization). If you want more, smarter options, the Sony is a better choice (but it suffers from slow operational speed and aggressive noise reduction - especially noticeable in portraits).In conclusion, I think the Canon is definitely a good camera, but whether it's the best for you really depends on your preferences. For me it works, though it would be much better still with better battery life, a 4:3 screen, and an extra (programmable) button (that could also be used to delete images in review mode)", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera but has trouble outdoors", "Author": "R. Rose \"Ricktig\"", "ReviewID": "R11QQOYXLUPKS9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera before a trip to Yosemite NP in June.  I took over 900 photos on the trip while learning it's features and trying out many different settings and options.  For the most part, the pictures are great!  However, this camera really struggles with sunny outdoor shots.  Every single daylight shot that I took is significantly overexposed!  Most of these were taken either on the 'auto' mode or 'outdoor' mode per the camera's manual.  The camera has a setting whereby you can dial down the f-stop which darkens the subsequent shots but unfortunately this setting is lost each time the camera is turned off.  Since I needed to turn it off quite frequently to conserve the battery, this solution was unworkable as it's not reasonable to continue to have to redial this f-stop change each time you stop for a few pictures.I contacted Canon support and basically they indicated that this is how the camera operates.  They suggested sending it to a service center for repair bit I don't believe that this problem is specific to my camera.  It takes great photos in dim lighting but I suspect that the trade off for that feature is poor handling of bright lighting situations.Unfortunately I will be returning this camera to the retailer while I search for another camera with GPS that takes better daylight photos.Other issues include the persistent pop up flash.  It pops EVERY time the camera is turned on.  That feature is highly annoying.  The camera also seems to have an issue with the panorama 'stitch' function whereby the preview images don't line up properly.  The preview seems to zoom in some causing the alignment to be off.  This can be compensated with the Canon software but requires post-processing of each panoramic image set.I also experienced issues with the geotagging function.  The camera could only find a GPS satellite lock about 25% of the time, despite most of the images being taken in open meadows, etc.  I'm assuming that the high valley walls of Yosemite could be to blame, but I took several hundred shots out of the valley and at the other national parks in the area with the same missing geotag result.  This is probably not the camera's fault but still something to be aware of.  It will most likely not geotag all of your photos.I really tried to like this camera but will continue to search for one that takes better daylight pictures.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Defective Batch???", "Author": "L.

For everyone complaining about the pop up flash if you actually read your manual it explains that there is a better way to hold the camera which will not mess with the pop up flash.  With your left hand point to the right with your pointer finger, your thumb pointing upwards, the camera bottom should rest/cradle on your pointer finger with your thumb on the left side also as a cradle.  You will find there is a \"nook\" on the camera made for your thumb for just this function, to cradle the camera.  Amazingly you will find that holding the camera this way keeps it more sturdy than the old fashion way of holding a point and shoot camera.  Try it, it works.I have nothing but good things to say about the camera.- The HS system capabilities make it so that you do not need a flash for 90% of pictures, its amazing.  The night shots ive taken are great.- The camera has DSLR settings and functions which make it possible to do astro-photography and other advanced things not possible with normal point n shoots- The GPS is great but if you dont need it you can easily turn it off under settings, and when you do battery life is what should be expected. 2nd battery still a good idea as with any camera.- HD video takes better video than my sony handycam.- The build quality is great, nice and sturdy feeling.- 14x zoom in a point n shoot?

I own a Canon T2i DSLR so I was already comfortable with Canon's quality. I also own a Panasonic DMC-FH25, which is also a good quality, compact, high zoom camera (8x).What prompted me to purchase this camera was the CMOS sensor coupled with Canon's DIGIC 4 image processor (the same processor used in the T2i DSLR).My opinion; This is one fantastic little camera. When I do not want to haul out my DSLR and it's bag of associated lenses, this is my absolute favorite. The Panasonic FH25 has more pixels but, to me, it also has noticeably more noise. On a 4x6 print, I doubt that anyone could tell the difference (for daylight shots).This Canon excels at low light shots. I took a few test shots this morning, before sunrise, using the 'auto' mode with no flash. I pointed this at a store front and took a hand held 'auto mode' picture. It came out as f/3.1, 1/30 second, ISO1600 and was excellent quality. I then zoomed all the way in on the store's glass door and got another shot at the same settings. The picture quality amazed me. This little thing, at low light, equals or betters my older T2i for low noise.If you are thinking of purchasing a compact, hi zoom, camera, please consider this one. My Panasonic FH25 was priced (at the time of purchase) only about $50.00 less than this Canon. The extra $50 for this camera bought some very good features and extra performance.For the old school people (like me):The F stop has a good range of manual settings. You can do 'Program', 'Manual' or 'Tv/Av' settings as in a much higher priced camera.I did not buy this for videos, but, it will make a good quality HDTV video. Some nice things in that department; You can zoom while recording and this thing has two microphones on the front for that '2-channel' sound. It also has a dedicated 'record video' button.I am just super happy with the performance (for cost) of this thing.Ken", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon what's going on? another soft focus camera?", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R2Y09XSJ1T60RX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to give this one a try after the terrible A3300. I have an old Canon sd950 that takes amazing photos but its a bit out dated and the focusing is slow as well as saving. I had hoped that the 230 would work out after trying the A3300, although, I liked its size, ergonomics and features, it took very soft unsharp photos. This 230 seems to suffer from the same problems. Out of 10 test photos, both flash and non flash of the same subject, half were soft and very grainy. I tested both outdoors and indoors with various subjects, lighting, objects etc and while some portrait photos looked great, everything else just didn't have that sharpness. I utilized the many settings on the camera which was the main reason I wanted to try this one out. It has a full auto mode that was just terrible with exposure and focus. The program mode was good but not up to par. The Shutter and aperture settings were the same.I have a panasonic FH25 and compared photos taken together with the Canon 230 and the panasonic was a clear and I mean clear winner. Although it doesn't have many of the cool features the canon does and the lcd screen wasn't as sharp, the bottom line is that the photos come out crystal clear for less than half the price of the canon. The flash on the panasonic tends to be a little too bright and all of the photos seem to have a slight green hue where as the Canon's exposure when using flash was better as well as the color tones. But, I can correct most of the Panasonic's minor problems in photoshop whereas you can't do much with sharpness with out it looking odd so for that alone the canon has to be returned for soft photos.

Canon did a great job balancing noise reduction and fine detail. Lens distortions are not a concern, and chromatic aberrations are well controlled. An eensy bit of color fringing at certain apertures and focal lengths is apparent, but only when pixel peeping.The camera handles quite well, although it feels as though it could slip out of my grip a little too easily. The pop-up flash that annoys so many people is not an issue; the way I hold the camera to turn it on, my finger is already pressing on the flash. It didn't occur to me that I was keeping the flash from popping up until I accidentally powered the camera on while holding it one-handed. And went, \"Oh, yeah!\"If I could change anything about the SX230, it would be the LCD aspect ratio; I'd make the camera a wee bit taller and give it a 4:3 LCD. That's only because I have old eyes that don't see close up very well. Shooting in any aspect other than 16:9 results in a whittled down image on the display. Oh, and I'd make deleting pictures a lot easier. The way it is you have to go into the menu to erase pictures, and it's a four-step process.Bottom line: The folks at Canon have outdone themselves.

Even after 2.5 months of using this camera extensively I'm not comfortable w/ the menu system.I've used kodak, sony, and a lot of nikon point and shoot cameras before this and I bought this camera over the Nikon 9100 because of the GPS and a review that said the menu system was better.  It is my first Canon camera.RE: GPSIt works okay but my phone's GPS app works better.  It doesn't log as often so if you use it to GPS log driving trips you'll have a lot of straight lines through curves.  If this were adjustable it'd be better.  The included map utility is basic but you'll need it to import the GPS log files from the camera directly or from the SD card.  I always export it to google earth and modify the path in there so it's more accurate.  Again, my phone's GPS app is better.RE: high sensitivity CMOS sensorI assume the Nikon 9100 has similar results.  Don't expect a huge difference in low light between a CCD and CMOS camera but it is noticeably better, about 20% less noise. Pictures using flash turn out well.RE: camera recording/shutter lagI'm using a 16GB class 10 transcend SD card.  It takes a while to process the photos but I'd imagine other point and shoot cameras would take just as long before you can take another shot.  Again, depends which mode you're in and switching to specific modes is a pain for me.RE: Panoramic stitch assist modeI thought I could take less pictures using a wide angle camera but the stitch assist mode requires 30% overlap in pictures. I'm used to my nikon's 20% overlap.  I didn't try the included canon stitching software but in Photoshop they turn out great.  I found the Sony sweep panoramic mode unusable because you have to go 180 degrees or more and the panoramics were small resolution. The newer ones claim 42MP panoramics but I'm wary about the 180 degree sweep when I only want a smaller panoramic view.RE: 14x zoomHaving a 14x zoom is really nice and worth the extra size.  Just check out the pictures of the moon I took without a tripod (I leaned my arm on something though).  Have to adjust the settings w/ manual mode of course. Also nice to have since I do a lot of hiking and can zoom in on the city below.RE: Macro modeIt doesn't keep it's macro mode setting but I learned that if I want a macro shot I just adjust it to auto mode and it'll do it.RE: VideoThe slow motion mode is okay but it's small resolution makes it nothing more than a gimmick. HD video is good unless you plan to use it in low light.  Low light performance is poor in video mode.  I've only used the 720p mode since it saves on file size.RE: Color Swap modeIt's more of a color replace mode.  You replace a color with an existing sample color.  I think of swapping as turning the blues to reds and the reds to blues.  It has it's limitations and it'd be cool if it could work on textures like wood grain.RE: Battery lifeWith any point and shoot you'll want to buy an extra battery.

I do a lot of international traveling and the size is perfect for putting into my pants pocket during day trips.  The macro is very, very good and when traveling or walking in my neighborhood, I always take lots close-ups of flowers.  This camera blows away the 200 and 210 in terms of focusing speed and color accuracy.  I may be wrong, but I think the lower number of mexapixels on the 230 and newer CMOS are reasons for the increase of both factors.The zoom is terrific for taking far away landscape photos, portaits of people and for macro close-ups.  Very accurate and easy to acquire the image quickly.  Some reviewers have mentioned the battery drains quickly but I am able to get approximately 250 pictures on a single charge.

I can throw anything at it - flashpots, direct stage lights, everything... and it doesn't blink.  Have AWESOME video of the 12.12.12 concert for Superstorm Sandy at MSG, and for Carrie Underwood - she pointed lights directly into the audience - NO bleed at all.  I get the best pics by running video, using Picassa, and doing a frame snapshot from the video.  Even did great at the Justin Bieber concert (took the 12 year old nieces) - sorted out the music from the LOUD shrieking very nicely.  What I could NOT understand at the concert, I COULD understand on playback on the computer because the sound sensing on the camera is so awesome.SO?  Final opinion?  RUN and get one.  And get more than one.... because everyone else will want one, too.  Set on HD, a 4.5 min song uses about 1G of space for video - so you need large memory cards (I use 16G & 32G), and I used 4 batteries for the 6 hour 12.12.12 concert (and 36G of memory), but with spare cards and spare batteries, this camera will do about anything a normal user could want - and is ESPECIALLY awesome in low-light, concert-type situations.  You can just leave the camera in \"movie mode\" and take both video and pics. All are great. Enjoy!", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very impressive for a point and shoot", "Author": "E. Sikorski", "ReviewID": "R1FOBU6MI1ITG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading hundreds of reviews for many cameras, I finally settled on this one. So far, I think I made a very good decision. I wanted this camera because of its size, zoom capabilities, and low light shooting quality. I am replacing a 5 year old Olympus mid-level point and shoot. With only a week of picture taking, this camera blows it away. The zoom is incredible - I took crystal clear pictures of hockey players on the ice like I was right behind the glass..except I was sitting a few hundred feet away. The low light performance is great with me being able to take almost every picture I have wanted without the flash. I love the manual mode which will let me learn how to take pictures for real and should work nicely as a tuturial when I get a DSLR one day.As many have mentioned, the short battery life and flash location leave something to be desired. However, the charge time on the battery is about 2 hours...so pick up a spare battery on Amazon (they were like 13 bucks when I looked last). And since I hardly use the flash, it is not a big deal. I just push it back down. I wish there was an ISO adjustment for auto though as it always picks ISO 1600 for indoor shots, which is too much. The picture is a little grainy.Still, the many great features far outweigh the few negatives. As I get to learn the camera better, I will be sure to update my review in the future.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great advanced-level camera, BUT -", "Author": "S. R.

I bought this camera based on three criteria:1. Picture quality that almost rivals a DSLR.2. Portability.  Small enough to carry in my pocket and take almost anywhere, hiking, skiing, and horseback riding.3. GPS.  I take a lot of pictures while traveling in the back country, and I want to be able to locate scenes when I get back home.I am very happy with my choice.  This is a great camera that COULD BE AWESOME if Canon would fix some annoying features and functions:1. Poor battery life.  Very disappointing.  Get at least two extra batteries, especially if you use the GPS a lot.2. Terrible flash position.  Need I say more?3. Frivolous features such as \"Color Swap\", \"Fish Eye Lens\", \"Miniature Effect\", and \"Toy Camera Effect\" are included, instead of serious features such as Exposure Bracketing.4. Some of the functions are almost impossible to perform.  For example, to lock the focus, one must \"keep the shutter button pressed halfway and press the < button\".  If you are holding the camera correctly, you will need a third hand to do this.5. The overall build quality is excellent.  However, the cover for the interface jacks seems rather fragile.  I would have preferred rubber instead of plastic.6. The included software programs are a bit cludgy, and this release of the ZoomBrowser has omitted a feature, Camera Remote Control, that I use with my Canon S3 IS when digitizing 35mm slides.7. The User Guide provided on the CD is poorly organized, and the function descriptions are incomplete. For example, \"When the camera is turned off, it will continue to receive a signal from GPS satellites for a certain interval of time...\". It would be nice to know what that certain interval is, and how often route information is updated.8. The current GPS location cannot be viewed unless one takes a picture and then reviews the picture information.  An active location display would be more appreciated than the real-time clock display that Canon has provided.9. One cannot change batteries if the camera is mounted on a tripod.  (This would not be a big deal if the battery life were longer!)Overall, the optical quality is excellent for a camera this size.  There is some barrel distortion at wide angle, but that is to be expected.I would not hesitate to recommend this camera, even with the above caveats.

We researched quite a bit and thought the SX230HS was the best option in this class, but ultimately we are not happy.  We are not pleased with the point-and-shoot image quality on this camera and it also has a few other annoyances.  We are fairly fluent with tech devices and have used multiple digital cameras over the years with good success (including training others how to these types of tech devices as part of job).  We were expecting an experience similar to what we have had with other intermediate digital cameras: point + shoot = good quality picture (a high majority of the time).  Unfortunately, we have found our SX230HS is not a camera we can set to \"auto\" and trust to take consistent quality photos.  After the first couple of months we have taken 900+ photos and multiple movies; here is what we have experienced:Size: Great size for coat pockets -- a huge plus over our larger Kodak.  Much easier to bring along for any trip.Movies: We use a Class10 SD card and have had no problems.  Movies devour storage space so don't think this is the device for extended movies unless you invest in storage.  For a point-and-shoot camera the movies are really great - even in low through medium light.  We have also been able to work on them in iMovie without issue (see transfer issue in battery section below).Battery: Weak, buy two.  On a Mac it takes FOREVER to transfer movie files via USB, and it is VERY frustrating when the battery dies mid-transfer and you have to start the transfer all over again.  Make sure battery is fully charged before transfer and hope for the best.Very Low Light Photos: It does better in very low light than the Kodak and Sony cameras we have (it can \"focus\" in situations the other cameras cannot).  ** Keep in mind there can be significant noise in these low light photos, but at least you have a picture.Earth-tone Paint warning:  If you have earth-tones in your house I suggest considering a different camera.  Our house has mostly earth-tones, but it is not what I would call \"dark\".  For example, during the day the many windows (12 on the first floor) provide enough light to read easily without needing electric lights.  The problem is that when taking pictures inside our house day or night this camera's flash is very unpredictable from picture to picture resulting in disappointing images.  Our SX230HS seems totally confused on what to do in a medium lighting situation, the only thing I can think of is the earth-tone paint.  Tip: Our work-around in medium light is to force the flash on and then cover half the flash with our finger when we take the shot (this works pretty good, but we should not have to do it).  Our Sony, Kodak and friends' various cameras don't require this type of work-around in our house -- it just seems medium light or earth-tones are really challenging to our SX230HS sensors.Point-and-Shoot:  This class of camera should be really as simple as point + shoot = good pictures (the vast majority of the time).  Unfortunately this has not been true for us regardless of the lighting (indoors or outdoors) or the photographer.  After the initial poor results (very noisy or out of focus even though we had focus lock before fully depressing the shutter, etc.) we actually read the manual and tried various settings with mixed but still too many disappointing images.  Our final outcome is that this camera just simply struggles for us on point-and-shoot.  Photos taken on our Kodak, Sony and friends' various cameras are usually clearly better than the ones on our SX230HS.Zoom: Optical zoom is what you should focus upon when considering point-and-shoot digital cameras (ignore and turn off the digital zoom - digital zoom is mostly marketing hype).  Also know that even though two cameras may have the same X zoom factor, they may not result in the same \"close-up\" photo ability.  There is ample info on web explaining how to best estimate a relative comparison between cameras (on point and shoots the focal length is a key component).  Interestingly, we found that although our calculations indicated the SX230HS should result in more \"close-up\" images than our point-and-shoot 8X Kodak, in our testing we found their optical zoom results are very similar --  the SX230HS has a nominal edge to the Canon, but not \"wow!\"Conclusion:While it has multiple neat features, regardless of the cause our SX230HS camera simply results in far too many unacceptable photos.  It is not a point-and-shoot I can recommend.

I just purchased another one to replace it.  I'll give the older one to someone who only wants to take photos.I purposely bought this camera and housing for SCUBA.  After spending $100 to $1,400 on cameras, I was stunned to see how great the pictures and videos came out.  I added this video to show what it is like by simply selecting SCUBA mode (a little fish icon) and doing nothing else.  You can get fancier with development of the `white balance', but I stuck to the basics.  The sea lion scenes were at 20 feet and the rest of the dives were at 40-70 feet.  The color was almost always balanced and the focus very crisp.The description of all the other functions of this camera are listed below, but I think the first reviewer here nailed the camera's qualities.  It is an easy point `n shoot camera with some extras.  The GPS is a gimmick, but it does work well in placing your photos if you want to display them on GOOGLE Earth.  However, the housing restricts that feature.  The 12.1 megapixels are great for even posters or flat screen televisions (I use mine through my Blu-ray disc player for YOUTUBE).  The function set, display, menu and the dial are all easy and intuitive.  The zoom is remarkably steady (I recommend a small tripod).  I've never cared for Optical Zoom, but the 14X works as well as any.I do not care for the location of the flash.  This surprised me, so you have to get used to keeping your left fingers from the top left of the camera.  The HDMI A/V out cover is very flimsy and fortunately you may not have to use this much, but I can see it as being very fragile.This is really a remarkable camera for the price.  I have yet to test the stereo microphones, but I can imagine that for the family filmmaker, this might be fun to watch and listen to on a television with stereo speakers.  The software that is included is also very simple but important.  The features are numerous and it's nice to have something that directly deals with the camera features other than just `Windows Movie Maker\".

I also took photos of the game: I was on the 45 yeard line and was able to get great close-ups of the action when they weree on the 10-yard line at the other end of the field.Need to do macro shots? If so, this is the camera for you. It does not have a Macro setting. Instead, it automatcially goes into Macro mode when you are taking a photo of a close-up object. I put a silver dollar on the table, put the camera into Auto mode, got within a few inches of the ooin and the camera automatically went into Macro mode. The photos I got were sharp and detailed.The camera shoots  amazing HiDef video in stereo. It is so sharp I will no longer take my camcorder with me when I travel. Also, you can use the zoom while shooting video without hearing the noise of the camera zooming in.The worst thing I can say about the camera is that the flash is in a place where I would normally place my left hand to hold the camera; this however is a very small issue that I can work with.

I got the camera only a day or so before leaving on vacation, so I didn't have time to study the manual.  I found it very intuitive and easy to use.I took over 600 pictures and videos combined.

I could easily carry it in my pants pocket.  It's also comfortable and easy to hold while taking still shots or videos.

I had concerns about the pop up flash but it has not been an issue . Actually I like it. If you want a flash you lift it up ..if not you push it down. No messing with the menu to turn flash on or off. It comes up automatically but easily closes back down. The features on the camera are just like my 35mm Rebel Digital Camera. So now I have a point and shoot in size with the features of a true 35mm SLR. Go AUTO if your lazy but also be super creative with the manual overrides.The auto features are amazing as it literally detects every type of scene on its own in AUTO mode. It knows if it is macro,sport,portrait,landscape etc...but just in case... you can always override.And the 14x zoom is as good as it gets.

When my Canon powershot broke, I thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to upgrade and purchase this camera. I purchased it from Amazon, but returned it because my old powershot started to work just fine. But I feel I would have returned this camera anyway for a few reasons. Though it is jampacked with features and settings and quality (more than the average camera user needs), there are some things that I find critical that this camera seemed to lack or bother me. But let's start with what I liked. I loved the quality, and the ease with which I could use this camera. Being that I don't know a lot about the full potential of the settings of this camera, I was worried that I would be lost in the settings, or too difficult to use and that I'd be stuck using AUTO a lot. But I found that I could find all the settings I wanted with ease and enjoyed that. I thought the flash was cool, but it pops up right where my left hand would be holding it, so I felt that was a bit poor on the design. I liked how sturdy it felt, yet lightweight. Now, for the things I didn't really like as much. This camera was bigger than I imagined. I suppose I really do gravitate more towards the smaller cameras to bring around in a pocket or something and this is definitely not the camera for that. Also, I did not like the short battery life. I'm the type of person that doesn't charge my phone everyday (and I have an iphone), so realizing that I'd have to charge this battery frequently was really disappointing. I think this is what got me to return it the most because I love having my camera on me wherever I go, so I don't think to charge it after every long period of use.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon PS SX230 Review", "Author": "N.

I have taken numerous photos of stationary wildlife while zoomed out, but very few of them turned out to be acceptable.  Most of them were blurry.

If you want to start playing with features and settings, it is quite the playground. I upgraded from a Kodak something-or-other mega zoom camera with similar features and settings, and have found the Cannon to be a bit harder to navigate, but much more rewarding. For example: Using the manual mode and upping the shutter speed makes for some good times. The Cannon never began acquiring hot-pixels, where the Kodak would have hot-pixel galore anytime the shutter was left open for more than 10 seconds. I have taken some beautiful sunset/twilight photos with the Cannon that came out quite well, and have even taken some photos of stars and planets (not zoomed in) where the brighter celestial objects show up quite well. For example, on a biking trip of the White Rim in Canyonlands, I was able to image the big dipper with the silhouette of the canyon walls. Very fun.I take pretty much only out doors photos, and have found that the Cannon 230 does a remarkable job capturing the color IF you know how to finagle it (see hate section below.) I have found great success within imaging desert, mountains, foliage, flowers, lakes etc. I have had people ask if I have edited my photos to make the colors \"pop\" more. Answer is no, unless I was trying to put multiple images on a calendar face with multiple images, where I wanted the same apparent brightness of everything on that page. Moral of the story, beautiful colors if you play your cards right.I hate this camera....The track focus mode makes me sad. Super sad. Using the automatic mode, it will automatically start using track focus if the camera sees fit. I don't know if this feature can be turned off (it can be turned on manually on the fly if wanted) for I have not found the setting and have probably eaten the manual already. It is nowhere to be found and I never think to look it up on the internet. Back to the point, imagine you find a really, really cool flower. I mean awesome. You bust out your Cannon SX230, get on the ground, put the camera up to the flower, and the camera elegantly and automatically switches to micro. Nice you are ready to shoot. But as you click the shutter button, it switches to tracking focus, and gets confused, and takes a fuzzy photo. It can take several attempts of clicking shutter button down several times before it stays on micro. And when it works, it works wonderfully.More on the track focus thing. Say you are taking a mountain photo and you want to get better colors by darkening the image, so you aim more at the sky, and click shutter half way, move the camera down and take your pic. If the track focus is on it keeps on tracking and will track back to the brighter version of your image. If it just focused and stayed in the first place, it would have been fine. Ultimately, I hate the track focus thing. ANNOYING!As with many digital cameras I am sure, you do need to be smart about tricking it to take better pics.The battery life is Meh. I have done some 4-5 day backpacking trips without too much of a problem. Just avoid a lot of videos and leaving camera on while not in use. But it can creep down pretty quick if you don't pay attention. not a deal breaker there. Flash is in a TERRIBLE place, but you learn to live with it and you forget about it.This camera is a bit hard to navigate without the manual.SUM IT UP:When this camera works well, it works beautifully. I learn how to better utilize it and find new fun features after every trip. If you have the patients to try and get the stupid track focus thing to not pop up, and have a moment to finagle to get a good pic, this is a GREAT camera. But if you are looking for a quick shooter where you wanna quickly take a pic and run, I can see where the image quality can suffer. I still don't mind taking my time to get some good photos. If it was wanted as a family camera, I would look elsewhere. But if you are wanting to play pretend outdoor photographer and take your time, you will be pleased.

I love the camera, picture quality, and ease of use, but the GPS isn't worth the extra money. GPS works only if you're in a relatively wide-open area, and it takes several minutes to sync. It does faithfully record the location and time data, but not always for all pictures. Wander down a narrow street, for example, and the GPS loses its reading. It does chew up the battery pretty quickly, but that's not a problem as long as you bring a spare. While running the GPS and shooting pictures, the battery will last 3-4 hours. You have to remember to turn off the GPS when you're done for the day. If you don't, it continues to eat up power even when the camera is off. (You're warned about that whenever you turn the GPS on.) I do like the little utility that comes with it that lets you write location data to any photo after the fact. I suspect the utility also comes with the 220 model, so I really didn't need to waste the extra money.Enough ranting about the GPS - I just will use it sparingly. Photos are stunning, and the HD video is awesome.  Be advised that you'll need a decent computer to be able to play the HD vids.  By \"decent\" I mean a high-speed processor, plenty of memory, and an independent high-speed video card.  One one of my laptops, the HD videos stutter when I try to play them.

Steiner", "ReviewID": "R3N2MP7DKCCOKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is going to be a review with a little difference.  I have read almost all of the over 280 customer reviews of the Canon SX230HS camera on the Amazon.com Web site.  AFTER THAT I ORDERED ONE.  The following observations explain why.Like so many people that buy things from Amazon.com I rely heavily on the customer reviews before ordering things.  I appreciate the time and effort reviewers take in trying to help customers make informed buying decisions, but the greater number of reviews the greater number of contradictions one must wade through.  Here is what the reviews of the Canon SX30HS camera told me:1.  Most negative comments were referring to the automatic popup flash feature.  The reviewers carried on about where the flash unit was located and the fact the thing opened when the camera was activated and the only way they could stop that was to keep their finger on the flash while turning on the camera.  Then they usually went on to say it didn't matter.2. Almost every review in the bunch said the battery drain in the Canon SX230HS was awful, but that is about what the manufacture implied it would be with the GPS and all.  Give me a break.3. Another big complaint was with how the camera was difficult to hold and one needed to be careful in order to keep from dropping it. Well, gee people--is being careful with an expensive camera an unusual thing to keep in mind when using it?4. More than one reviewer admitted that they dropped their cameras and then described the resulting damage. I am not sure they were suggesting that Canon was responsible for that, but even mentioning how clumsy they were and then blaming the camera was a bit over the top.5. Some reviewers were critical of one or all of the user settings offered on the camera.  Most of those reviews came from people who couldn't tell the difference between an ISO setting and a prune.  After whining about the complexity of making manual adjustments they usually said pictures shot using the AUTO setting were great. When one buys a point and shoot camera then complains when not using it that way probably should have kept the Kodak Baby Brownie.6. The GPS doesn't work indoors.  Yep, that is exactly what most reviews said.  I guess it is true, but maybe that all depends on the `doors' one is in.7. The camera is heavy say some.  How heavy could a thin four inch wide camera be?8. A wish that the camera made it easier to delete a bad photo might be a legitimate complaint and it appears in the reviews several times. At least it is possible to erase bad shots even if it takes a few clicks to do it.9. Not having a view finder on the camera was mentioned, but how many other little point and shoot pocket sized cameras have one of those?10. The reviewers all seemed to like the HDMI and HD features.  I guess both have something to do with television and there is a special cable involved that isn't included with the camera (sold separately).The camera \"experts\" provided detailed lists of Pros and Cons which seldom did much too understandably critique the Canon SX230HS for non-experts.  I guess other experts like to know that the white balance is good, the camera compares favorably to a NIKON S9100 or that the focal range is acceptable. Is this a point and shoot camera or what?  Anyhow, those lists were sort of interesting albeit mostly esoteric comparisons meaningful to very few readers.Most of the Canon SX230HS reviews were very positive and told of how happy the owners were with the camera.  The reviewers liked the high12 to 1 MP resolution, the anti-shake feature, the remarkable zoom and the excellent video capability.  They liked the looks of the camera and many said it was generally the best on the market.  Above all, most reviewers said the camera produced excellent photographs.  But then there were a few that had very little good to say about anything. Go figure.Some hated the GPS feature unless they really liked it.Over and over the reviews contained grumbling about the flash, the short battery life and how hard the camera was to hold# Some of this is probably warranted, but none of it is likely to be a deal breaker.Then there were reviews that were silly or just plain picky  Is it all that important to know the blue colored camera is actually a dark turquoise? Or, who wouldn't buy the Canon SX230HS because somebody thought the camera they received was poorly packed in the shipping box?  \"If you want more, pay more--If you want less, then pay less.\" I'll have to remember that one.  A comment about how puzzling it is to open the battery compartment was hard to believe.  Can that really be a problem?\"The camera doesn't let me think.\" That could be a blessing. How about this? \"I have big hands so the camera was hard to grip.\"  Was that a criticism of the camera or the reviewer's large hands?  Then there are the helpful gold stars.  I presume that a half star is better than no star?  But, by how much would that be?  Is there a margin of error?  One reviewer said this, \"I gave it four stars because I don't think anything is perfect.\"What I finally determined from reading all of the reviews was not a big surprise.  For references to the excellent qualities in the camera there was also a review or two that said the camera was terrible.  FOR ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE MANY COMPLIMENTS THERE WAS PROBABLY ONE COMPLAINT.I found many things in the reviews that were quite comical.  The reviewers meant well of course.  Here is a collection of direct quotes from the reviews of the Canon SX230HS that I found amusing:* \"The price was just right, but it could be lower.\"*  \"14x zoom: It is really amazing how they are able to put a 14x zoom in such a small body?\"*  \"The zoom on this camera is unlike any other small camera I have seen. It is better than binoculars.\"* \"I like the camera, but since I am a senior citizen I have a hard time learning new things.\"* \"I appreciate your concern regarding the Canon camera and it is deficient.\"* \"My wife has been the family Digital Camera Photographer since we began having kids.\"*  \"I loved this camera when it worked.\"* \"The camera came without strap# It should be a manufacturer's fault.\"* \"I like the crisp sharp details the flash produced# Not sure if other cameras in this class have the same issue.\"* \"This review may not be considered useful and provide info you care about.\"*  \"And, no, I did not read the manual.\"* \"We have kids in sports, and we go to concerts and travel to Lake Tahoe and do cruises and Disneyland every couple of years.* \"I almost never needed flash until the sun was completely gone.\"* \"I wanted a small camera for my trip to Italy because my superzoom is too large.\"* \"I have two small children and was sick of missing pictures.\"* \"Don't Care about GPS don't use it / turned it off.\"* \"It's a nice camera for photography.\"* \"For the money though, the images are quite horrible.\"* \"Not everything is for everyone.\"OK, I am finished with a review of reviews#  Because most of the comments were exceedingly positive, I went ahead and ordered a Canon SX230HS camera from Amazon.com.  When I get it I might even evaluate the thing as a reviewer, providing I find something new to bring to the long list of wonderful and helpful reviews already provided.=======================I received the Canon SX230HS three days ago and thought I would let you know that I am very pleased with it.  I have put it through a lot of shake down paces.  I have tinkered with a number of settings and taken lots of pictures with the camera set on AUTO or EASY which lets the camera do as it pleases. The resulting photos are outstanding. The camera takes great pictures in a variety of situations.I found the camera to be safe to hold and haven't dropped it yet.  The flash gripe is way overblown.  Holding the flash unit down while the camera boots up is simple, without effort and the camera doesn't suffer.I am old, but do not have trouble learning new things.  Even so, messing around with the menus and dedicated settings required a little effort.  The picture taking choices on this camera are many, but some are a bit inane. It remains to be seen how often I will venture into the world of self determined settings.  I like the AUTO and the EASY settings and they like me.The GPS feature is still a mystery since I have not been able to connect with a positioning satellite so far.  My Garmin GPS unit has a bit of trouble doing that too.  I will keep trying to connect, but I am not quite sure why.The optical zoom combined with the anti-shake feature is fantastic. I was blown away with the zooming capacity.  Previous reviewers were not wrong about this.I bought the black version of the camera and the color is actually black.  I thought it might be dark gray.  Just joking.I sound as if I like the Canon SX230HS?  Ya think?LATER:  After several months with the Canon SX230HS I continue to be impressed with it.  I have taken pictures all over the place and it does a great job.  I like everything about the camera.  It is the best in this price range and I think it is the best \"point and shoot\" small camera on the market. There is a newer model of this camera, but I really doubt that it is worth the higher price.I can recommend the Canon SX230HS camera without hesitation.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better IQ than Panasonic ZS3...", "Author": "kandoro", "ReviewID": "R1238IW0AORGQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After trying several other Panasonic, Nikon and Canon pocket type cameras I finally found one that exceeds my ZS3...By quite a bit actually...At least a stop better dynamic range and 2 stops better at ISO usage...It's just amazing the improvement these small sensors have made in DR and S/N over the last couple years...The full 1080p HD video is obviously far superior as well..The evaluative metering is awesome, so close to actual conditions it's scary...Even at tough low light situations...I also like the way Canon has used very little noise reduction up through ISO400 to retain much of the detail..Even above that the NR is minimal with no smearing that I can find...I just can't understand the outright negative reviews about bad image quality...They must have received defective units as I don't see how anyone wouldn't be happy with the IQ of this fine camera..I wish it was 24mm wide but I knew that going in so there is no way I would downgrade..At the on sale price of $188, I bought another one after testing this first one...Edit 1-1-12:After further testing I believe using center averaging metering is preferrable over evaluative...While they both are very accurate the center averaging avoids over exposing the highlight areas while retaining the shadows to an acceptible degree...There are always DR compromises in these small sensor cams, but the center does seem to offer the better DR coverge overall...kd", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this Canon SX230HS", "Author": "Infocraver", "ReviewID": "R27RMZESZCHR5B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, esp the ability to take low light photos.We were in the back of a darken auditorium watching our grandchild's Christmas program.

If is impossible to hold on to when you are taking pictures.  The rght hand slips off if trying to hold it while selecting features.  I did solve most of this problem with a stick-on handle from Flipbac.If you place your left hand on the camera to hold it while shooting, you either: cover the flash so it won't open, cover the speaker, or cover the GPS antenna.  There is no room for your fingers to hold it from the top and grabing it from the side is somewhat slippery with the stainless steel casing. 2. The menu system is extremely difficult and inconsistant.  I have had several Canon cameras and felt that eventhough others have coplained about this, I could master it easily.  Not so!!!  Each parameter has its own unique sequence to select it, change it and exit it.  Ok if all you use is \"Auto\" 3. Battery life. As others have mentioned, the batteries last about one fourth the time that other canon camera I had do.Having read the complaints on battery life, I bought an extra immediately.  Now I realize I will nee at least four batteries, mabye 5 or six, for any photoshoot.  And be sure you take your charger with you on any trip, and get an auto charger too.(BTW, turn the GPS off or the battery life is worse, if that's possible.)The good news is that it does take great pictures of high quality and is feature loaded.

However the image stabilization struggles a bit and you may have to hold the camera for a while while it locks on. Once it does the image will be sharp and crisp. The auto mode is a bit soft in both contrast and sharpness. Both issues can be addressed in the my colors mode. Low light ability is fine, just do not expect what you can get from a Canon S95, or S100. The one bad part about this camera is the highlight clipping and very bad color fringing on edges.In the pocket catagory I have used the Sony HX9v and found the smearing of fine detail not to my liking, ( I like to look at images full size). The Sony HX5V is similar but has fewer adjustments and is a bit softer. I liked the Panasonic FZ15 but the images were a bit grainier that the Canon. Also, I like the Canon color rendition better.If you want to go to a bigger zoom with a small sensor, the ones I have tried all will beat the pocket versions. The Sony Hx100V, the Panasonic FZ35 (excellent camera) or FZ150, and the Canon HX40 wll will all produce images with nicer tone, color, contrast, and dynamic range with less highlight clipping.Every camera is a compromise, this is a good overall camera that will always bring home a nice if not perfect image. I still use mine whenever I do not feel like carrying a bigger camera and need the zoom to go beyond 5 times.My big iron is a Panasonic GX1 with a 14 45 Panasonic zoom. For nights I use a Canon S100.

Another thing is when shooting video when using the zoom you will hear the zoom when you play back video, I suggest zooming to the zoom level you want before shooting videos.  This camera is the best camera in low light under $350 and in the top 3 to 5 camera in low light for any non DSLR.

The camera often chooses an ISO setting that is too high to prevent underexposure (in lieu of flash indoors), but ends up overexposing most photos because of it, and gives them a grainy quality.I took beach photos in auto mode on a clear, sunny day, and while the colors were good, the shutter speed was clearly too high, resulting in photos that were too light and too grainy. Additionally, this thing definitely leans pretty far towards the blue side of the spectrum in terms of color saturation (this can also be adjusted in program mode) in auto mode.The lens is great, and even at 8x zoom I was taking some great macro shots, something I like because you can often get better angles from a slight distance.

I've taken about a hundred pictures and mostly they are quite good.  Not as good as my T2i by any means but I didn't expect that.  I've discarded dozens of shots due to focus and/or camera shake issues but that's probably because I tend to not use automatic settings all the time.  Face detect works reasonably well.  Being able to use the optical zoom while recording HD video is a good thing.  My old Canon would only allow digital zoom once you started recording and that was a big disappointment.  There is very little noise in the videos from focusing and zooming.  Much less than than my other Canons even using USM lenses.Flash pictures are about what you would expect with the flash so close to the lens.  I'm going to devise a 'soften' style diffuser and see if it helps.The low-light capabilities of this camera are impressive but that seems to only apply to still pictures.  The low light video capabilities are about average.  As with all digital cameras using higher ASA speeds creates noise in the images.Battery life is not this camera's strong point - even after disabling GPS tagging.

We wanted to upgrade from a Canon Powershot A620, and tried (and were extremely disappointed with) both the Nikon L105 and the Canon ELPH 300 before giving this camera a shot. After being so disappointed by the ELPH 300 (which sounded like such a GREAT camera and has such a large volume of positive reviews, yet every picture we took was soft and grainy no matter how much we played with the settings), I was about ready to give up on getting a camera at this point because there didn't seem to be any great, affordable options. However, after seeing the photos taken with this camera that were uploaded by other buyers, I decided I had to give this camera a shot and see if the uploaded photos and reviews were accurate. Let me tell you, they are. Unlike the Nikon L105 and the Canon ELPH 300, this camera takes crystal clear photos that are not at all soft or grainy; and that's even with the zoom fully extended! Many of these photos have even been taken in low-light settings or settings with no natural light.I was hesitant to spend this much on a camera because I really wanted to stay closer to $100, but I decided that I would be willing to spend a bit more as long as I absolutely loved the camera. I absolutely love this camera. It feels like a huge upgrade from my Powershot A620 which is a decent point-and-shoot but about 6 years old (the Nikon L105 and Canon ELPH 300 definitely did not feel like a big enough upgrade to justify spending $100+); and even though I think $188 is pricey for a point-and-shoot (though $188 is a great deal for what amazon says is a $300 camera!), I definitely feel like it is worth the money. I am by no means an experienced photographer, but this camera is giving me exactly what I want: it takes great, clear photos off the bat, and I can already start to see how taking it off auto and manually changing the settings improves the quality even more. This seems like the perfect camera for both people who don't want to mess around with the settings at all but still get good photos, and people who want to start learning how to manually compose a photo without committing to an expensive DSLR.This camera is heavier than I expected, but not so heavy that I don't want to take it with me places. The pop-up flash is mildly irritating, but I tend not to use the flash, anyway, so when I do forget to hold the camera the \"right\" way and prevent the pop-up flash from popping up it really doesn't matter. I also don't think it's terribly awkward to hold the camera when the flash IS up, but maybe that's because reading all the reviews prepared me for that. We have the GPS feature turned off (so I can't speak for the quality of that feature), and the battery life has been great/reasonable in my opinion.

I briefly considered the S95/S100 but I decided that to me, zoom was more important than low light performance (however, the SX230 is no slouch in low light conditions). So the S95/100 was out. It was between the Sony HX9V and this one. I ultimately chose this one because the image quality is just SO MUCH BETTER. The Sony has very aggressive noise control and it gives photos a weird look - I would rather have photos be a bit grainy than have them look overly smooth. The Sony is also a little bulkier than the Canon, and more expensive (although it does have more features, assuming you want those).So far, I am VERY pleased with this little camera! It's not tiny (compared to say, a Canon ELPH 300) but its size is no problem for me. The camera feels solid and well-constructed. I love the 14x optical zoom. Photos are gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous! The camera seems to intuitively know what will make any scene look great. I am used to full manual control, but I basically leave this on Aperture Priority and have yet to be disappointed.

Low light performance is very good for a P&S.; It only goes down to f/3.1, but that seems to work for most conditions. HD video recording is very nice; both video and sound are clear.

This camera works well in low light.  Under bright conditions, every once in awhile theres tendency to overexpose by 1/3 of a stop. No biggie. Most consumers wont even know what Im talking about right now and just say the photo looks great cuz everything is well lit. 12mp is more than enough, I wish it was 10mp so the HS system works even better in low light.  All the features work on on the camera, refer to your manual tho as some features are a little hard to figure out at times.  I've owned 3 DSLRs, and 6 point and shoot cameras including the s95, and this has to be the hardest canon to figure out. So check your manual. The sx230hs is really the jack of all trades camera. It has every conceivable feature available on the market today for a point and shoot: GPS, CMOS HS system, massive zoom, truck loads of scene modes, manual modes, massive bright LCD etc, but you pay the penalty in battery life for all these features.To improve the battery life, turn off: continuous AF, servo AF, continuous IS. These aren't really needed unless you do sports.  And if you REALLY want to do sports photography, you need another camera.  You can also switch to center point AF to also improve battery life to stop the camera from attempting to focus.  Reduce the brightness of the LCD will help battery. If you plan to travel, get a 2nd or 3rd battery. Generics are cheap. Just be careful of boot leg canon batteries.  A $10 generic will work better than a $30 fake.For the design issue, im not sure i know why Canon flips out the flash each time you turn the camera on, seems like an unnecessary design issue. You can lower or open the flash manually yourself with your finger.  You can also hold down the flash while the camera starts up.  This is not super clear in the manual, but people who owned this series of cameras said its fine.  While there are manual modes, the camera still wants to work in auto, for example, when you change certain settings that Canon thinks that are only used occasionally such as macro mode or spot metering, it resets back to default focus and evaluative metering when turned off. while i agree that most ppl will not use these settings a lot, sometimes i want to have those settings set so i wont have to adjust my settings each time i start up.Final thought: Overall its a good compact travel zoom camera with amazing low light capability.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable zoom capability", "Author": "T. Sills", "ReviewID": "R333QFOMCT0ICE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waffled quite a bit on this and debated between the sx230 and s95.  In the end, I think the two cameras are really entirely for different purposes and people.  As someone who spent 15 years shooting with an all manual 35mm, I want the ability to manipulate the shutter/exposure on the fly.  This initially drew me to the s95 with it's wheels and ring for quick manipulation.  But when I stepped and asked what I really needed this point and click for...shooting kids' events, ease of use for wife, and compact size, I realized the desire to do full manual (or close to it) became less significant.Many of the same controls are available on the sx230, but they require some extra button pushes.  You might ask why it's important to do the manual override, but sometimes achieving that great shot may only be an f-stop away.  But for my wife and probably the majority of users, auto mode or shutter priority may be the next best thing.I picked this camera up a day before I went to the Porsche Rennsport Reunion at Laguna Seca.  So I had to learn on the fly how to use it.  With that said, here's my experience with it.Pros:- The telephoto range of this thing is 2nd to none.  It closed the gap across very large distances and maintained excellent sharpness.- I thought the zoom was fast and reacted way quicker than my Panasonic DMC-zs3.- Light balance and metering handled very difficult lighting situations well.  In some cases I was trying to shoot cars in garages what had brutally bright sunlight in the background, and the camera metered well off of the subject and didn't over react to the harsh lighting in the background.- One button push for video is very nice and makes it easy to cover photos and videos (as compared to other Canon models).- Video is very sharp (at 1080).  And colors looked excellent (daylight video, didn't try evening/indoor though).- Small foot print when you consider the zoom range.Cons:- Battery, battery, battery- you have to manage the juice when shooting video or doing flash fills- very frustrating and something I've experienced with my other Canon point and clicks.- Focusing- digital photography is a numbers game to me in that it's easy to shoot a lot of shots knowing you'll get some winners.  I found that the focusing was slow and sometimes hunted.  I found myself needing to constantly pre-focus (slight press of the shutter button) to ensure it was ready.On the other hand, I only had a few throw aways, but these were still irritating.- pop-up flash- this is irritating to me in that it gets in the way when holding (or maybe it's just me), so when powering on if you have your finger over the flash area it won't pop up.  So you have to manually flip it up when needed.  I often do a fair amount of flash fill during daytime shots so I'm constantly going back and forth between forced flash and no flash.  I guess you have to get used to just leaving it up.- no contoured body- I never felt like I had a good grip on the camera and wish it had a slight contour or bulge on the right side to make it easy to wrap you fingers around it.  It has some weight to it, and I would've liked getting just a bit better grip of it.  Even some sort of textured material/finish on the right side would have helped.  Because of this, you'll see some extra camera shake getting through when at full zoom.  So you need to really have a good posture and controlled breathing so as to not pass the vibrations through.Overall I think this is a fabulous camera that would meet most consumers' needs.  The high quality video and long range zoom will probably satisfy most users' needs.  Keep in mind that the penalty for that high zoom is the extra glass which will reduce the low light capabilities.  I shot a few indoor pictures and they seemed to be ok, but I was having to quickly compensate by cranking up the ISO.

Bottom line: I've owned all different kinds of makes and models of point and shoot cameras and this one by Canon is by far, THE BEST! I have always stuck with other brands and why it took me this long to finally purchase a Canon, is beyond me. I've been missing out, for sure. Anyway, I got my camera only a couple of weeks ago and have not had the pleasure of trying every feature just yet. However I have taken pictures in the most difficult setting I usually come across - concerts! The low lighting at concerts makes even the best cameras out there seem like a piece of junk sometimes. I took a chance bringing this, a new camera, with me to the concert. You only get one shot at taking pictures at concerts so you better make it worthwhile. I had confidence this camera would be able to do its job and do it well. After reading all of the positive reviews and knowing Canon's excellent reputation - why not try it?! Well, it did not disappoint. It took fantastic shots. I've never been able to get such clear shots at any concert, sitting even closer than the 14th row, off to the side, as I did this concert. I wish I would have had this camera at all of my previous concerts. Since it was the American Idol concert, I knew this would be a great opportunity to test out the camera with both fast paced and slow paced acts. It took absolutely phenomenal shots of the lighting of the stage. I took pix from all different zoom ranges and they all came out fantastic! The zoomed out range looks professional. When I zoomed in on a slower act, non-moving, it looks as though I was right on stage with them and they are so clear. The fast-moving acts were a little more difficult to get a picture of but this camera did a great job. I was able to get some really unique action shots where the top half of their body would be super clear but their legs, which they were moving, would be in a weird, cool looking, action motion. When there were alot of Idols on stage at once, the camera was able to get clear shots of every one of them without zooming out too far. For example, I was able to get crystal clear shots of about 5 of them at once, in one shot, depending on the distance between them. I took some video and that came out wonderful: both audio and video. I do not use GPS therefore I have not even tried it. I found the battery life to be great and I had the camera on throughout the concert as well as usage for other things before and after the concert. I am very happy with this camera and it's just confirmation that I should have bought a Canon years ago. I've missed alot of great concert shots. I can say that I will forever buy Canon when it comes to cameras ... lesson learned. 5 Stars", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video Camera Review", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R23VSIHZQZ64K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll let other reviews cover photo, I'm hitting the video. I like having ONE device with me to take pictures and video with.For us it's great, video is better than any dedicated video camera that doesn't cost significantly more than this still camera does. Videos are smooth due to the OIS, deals with oversaturated areas well. CMOS sensor allows great video even in low light conditions. Audio is great, microphones are on the FRONT of the camera. Microphones on the TOP of the camera don't work well for capturing sound outdoors. Wind filter is effective. It's hard to find one device that handles still pictures/video and audio well. Canon pulled it off.Cons: Battery life is short when shooting video, 45 minutes and it's done. File size is large, a 16GB card will only give an 1hr of 1080p video or 90min @ 720p. Cards aren't that expensive these days but loading the video to You tube takes awhile, even for a short clip. Sure I could take the stuff i know is going on Youtube at low resolution, but sometimes you don't know what you will end up loading.Other Thoughts: Great camera but pick up and extra battery if you will be using it for video.

Normally, I'm a \"buy and hold\" guy, driving cars 15 years, or until the oven pans covering up the rusted-out floor boards are more than my wife and kids can tolerate.  And the same always held true with respect to cameras--from my first Agfa Ambi Silette to my last Pentax Spotmatic (both lasting 15-20 years before I reluctantly retired each). But I still find that \"real\" cameras, as opposed to smartphones and the latest iPod Touch 5g, give me more control over \"what\" and \"how\" I shoot and produce better results.Which brings us to the Canon SX230.  I know--it's been superseded by the SX260.  But before I lose your attention, let me give you perhaps the foremost reason that you should look at the SX230 before considering any other point and shoot.  First of all, Amazon does not invarably offer the best price.  In the case of a few items, it pays to do the thing that's so obvious most shoppers overlook it: Go to the manufacturer's site.  In most instances, their \"fire sale\" price is no better than Amazon's regular price.  But I've uncovered a few manufacturers--eg. Tivoli Audio and Canon U.S.A.--who usually have at least one product that's accumulating in their warehouses faster than they can make room for their more recent models.  The result is a temporary sale of the item at a price no merchandiser, not even Amazon, can match.If you haven't gone to the Canon site as yet, and require some further justification for purchasing this camera--as opposed to relying on your iPhone or moving up to the SX260, here's what you might want to know:Canon and other camera manufacturers are well aware of the threat that \"smart phones\" represent to the entire industry.  Consequently, they're busy upgrading--above all, \"power,\" since iPhones don't come with a telphoto lens (I realize some consumers will attach professional recording mics and specially-built telephoto lenses to their iPod--but then what's the point of having a paper-thin, weightless iPod in the first place?).  I work with my photos in iPhoto, but the shots I get from my Canons are sharper, deeper, clearer, more colorful than those from my iPod.  I'm still a camera guy, and most likely you are too, or you wouldn't be scouting out \"dedicated\" cameras.So the next question: should you buy the SX230?  All things being equal (above all, price), I would opt for the SX260 like most other consumers.  But should you pay a whole lot more (150%) for the SX260?  Here's a comparison of the crucial differences (and similarities):1. Both have a GPS2. Both shoot movies at the desirable 24fps rather than 30.3. Both are compact, with identical dimensions (though the SX230 is 30 grams lighter).4. The lens of the SX230 \"stops down\" to f/3.5 (not so great for indoor, low-light shooting; the lens of the SX260 has only a slightly larger maximum aperture of f/3.1 (hardly a deal maker or breaker--my old Spotmatic had a lens that was f/1.9. Nowadays, I use my Elph SD4000, with an f/2.0 lens).5. The wide-angle field of the SX230 is 28mm; the SX260 has a 25mm lens, or 10% better wide angle range.  Again, a slight edge for the SX260, but not enough to make a big difference.6.  Here's the big one, the reason that so many people who have no right to be shooting bad pictures are shooting them anyway: the SX260 has a zoom that's 20X; the zoom lens of the SX230 is \"only\" 14X.If you think a zoom lens is such a big deal, notice the consumer cameras that are suddenly sporting 30X to 50X zoom power, all in an attempt to dazzle the inexperienced buyer. 1st, buyers were tricked into assuming the more megapixels the better; now much the same is occurring with zoom lens ratios.The fact of the matter is that excessive magnification and over-use of the zoom usually results in inferior photos (and movies)--grainy, out-of-focus, poorly composed, and distracting images.  My best results have always occurred when I used no zoom at all--or, to be more accurate, I used my body as a \"replacement\" for a zoom lens.  When I wanted a picture of a celebrity, I went to the front of the stage and shot from my knees!  Same with animals.  I got as close as I dared (within an arm's reach) of a Yellowstone bear (admittedly, not a Grizzly), offered it a cracker (on one occasion an egg boiled in a hot spring next to Old Faithful), then shot its picture.  You've got to work to get good photos!  My favorite, all-purpose Canon is also the tiniest Elf the company has released to date, the PowerShot SD780.  It has a zoom that's a measly 3X.  And that's all you really need--a lens that's ideal for portrait photography (since subjects tend to tense up when a camera is thrown in their face--or maybe it's the photographer's bad breath). Still, I'll grant that some people don't like to get close to wild bears (e.g. Colbert). And others may wish to have photographic evidence that a baseball pitcher is using an illegal spitball: if they can't get a seat closer to the action than the bleachers, then a 20X to 50X zoom is probably their best bet. (In my case, it's no longer a factor--I gave up on the Cubs 10 years ago).Another way of making the point is to ask camera bugs and neophytes alike to recite memorable \"zoom shots\" from the movies.  Sure, Hitchock uses the zoom when it's a \"subjective shot\" (i.e., the camera takes the place of the actor, showing  us what he sees). The best example would be the immobilized Jimmy Stewart looking at the \"action\" in the windows of an opposing apartment complex.  He's looking through binoculars. so Hitchcock allows the viewer to see the same magnified action as Stewart.  But in the final scene, as Raymond Burr is bearing down on Stewart ifor the purpose of silencing him for good, Hitchcock does what he almost always does: he uses a \"tracking shot,\"  which is to say that he moves the camera itself closer to the action.The zoom lens always is distracting because we become conscious of the camera and not the action.  Tracking shots, which simply require moving the camera closer to the action, are what professional cinematographers use at least 90% of the time.  So should you.In the old days (i.e. when we used \"film\") it was necessary to mount a heavy and huge zoom lens (mine was 135mm, tho I rarely used it) onto a 35mm camera simply to magnify the image by 3 times.  To be able to magnify it even by by 14 times is almost more power--and size--than I know what to do with.  As the world around you gets bigger, you suddenly begin to feel smaller. Thank goodness, zoom lenses aren't automatic (as yet): you still have to activate them manually (which I plan to do very sparingly with my SX230).[Tips (since learned): This is an excellent \"movie camera,\" with authentic stereo sound. Notice the tiny slits, esp. the one directly underneath the word \"Zoom\" on the camera's face (top left). Unless you're consciously aware of its location, your left index finger is apt to cover (and mute) the left microphone channel of your movie. Also, unlike other cameras the SX230 allows you to operate the zoom lens during the shot.  (Just be sure to carry an extra battery and to deactivate all of the unused features that shorten its life.}]", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not my favorite.", "Author": "B.

It has an extremely useful zoom range 28mm-392mm (equivalent) which really covers the zoom range most people absent unusual shooting circumstances will ever need 99% of the time.  A bit wider can sometimes be useful (ie 24mm) but the problem is that all cameras with built in lenses start up with the lens in its widest position and 24mm is usually too wide with too much distortion for normal use.  Also the brightest aperture is always at the widest end making that focal length very important.  Hence I believe 28mm (or perhaps 27mm) is the ideal 'starting point'.In any event, this camera takes (surprisingly) excellent photographs especially outdoors and at its brighter apertures (up to about 75mm equivalent) indoors.  The automatic white balance is superb for such an inexpensive camera.  The metering and exposure is also very good although outdoor photographs in high contrast situations tend to overexpose a bit; adjusting the exposure compensation to -3 is an easy fix.  The stabilization works very well enabling shooting at 1/30 shutter speeds and even slower.  The fact that aperture settings and shutter speeds are even adjustable on such an inexpensive camera is a wonder in itself.The maximum aperture range is very bright for this type of lens especially at this price point beginning at f/3.1.  Also the Megapixel count is not crazy at 12 (although 9 or 10 MP would make more sense for such a small sensor and such a long zoom range).  At wide angle, it is possible to shoot indoors without a flash under reasonable artificial lighting at ISO 400 (too much detail is lost beyond ISO 400) and get very nice and natural results.I was initially interested to see the successor to this model (SX260) but have since learned that although the zoom range has increased by 30%, the maximum aperture has substantially decreased to about f4 at 28mm equiv and to almost f7 at the end of the zoom range.  Given the substantial difference in price and presumably image quality, the SX230 may be the best pocket camera espicially for value.  I have also used pocket super zoom models form Panasonic (TZxx), Sony (HX9V), Samsung (HZ30W)& Kodak (Z950).  The Sony ranks 2nd in my opinion overall and the Samsung also does a very nice job under good lighting conditions, ie outdoors. The Samsung advertised zoom range does not appear accurate especially on the wide end. I was really not impressed with the panasonic except under blue/sunny skies. The Kodak (Z950) does a very nice job indoors and has far and away the strongest flash I have ever seen on a pocket camera and may be more useful when a strong flash is necessary.  The Kodak starts at 35mm equiv, not true wide angle.

Keep the GPS Logger in the OFF position and the GPS in the ON position.Right before you take your picture that you want the GPS location, go to the menu and THEN turn ON GPS Logger. It seems this approach provides a greater chance of gathering many satellites so that you can snag your position. I tried not turning on the logger function and just leaving the GPS on and it was frustrating that I was only getting 2 images with tags out of 50 pictures taken and my success rate increased after I modified my approach.I read a lot of complaining about the battery life consumption with leaving the GPS Logger on and it is true as this logs your position even when the camera is turned off. This logger is used if you want to view the route you have traveled on a map.I paid 198.88 from Amazon when I bought this in December 2011...I guess because Canon was/had introduced their 2012 model of this camera.

I narrowed it down to: decent zoom, good burst feature and pocket size. This does everything I wanted in a reasonable price (I paid $189) and also has HD video, aperture, shutter, manual and auto settings, and certain presets such as \"kids and pets\" which will give you as large a depth of field as the light allows as you photograph rapidly moving subjects. That's so that they and the background stay in focus while they move closer or farther away. I think for this price and size, you can't beat the combination of features. The 14x optical zoom is terrific, very responsive. The burst feature captures action shots. It's not as fast as some, but the Canon allows it to continually save to memory -- use a class 10 card, so you never have to wait, either. However, as it is saving, the view screen sometimes freezes, so you have to use your judgment to keep things in the frame. I have not found this to be a problem. The only camera I considered that had better features was the Canon sx 40, which costs $399, but is not a pocket camera at all. The size made the difference to me. This is not the smallest pocket Canon you can get, the Elphs are all quite a bit smaller, but they have very little zoom, and I went for the zoom because I do some wildlife photography and landscapes, too. If all you want to carry is one camera, and you want it to be reasonably small, there is no contest. This is the best. The photo quality is rated as excellent by many review sites and I concur. The look of the camera is a bit retro -- it would not look out of place next to a deco toaster, e.g., and the flash thingy pops up, but you can keep it pressed down if you want. You can put your finger on the corner on the edge of the camera if not. This is also not an issue for me. Maybe if you have big hands. But any small camera would give you issues if your hands are that big, no? The Elphs are tiny and more sleek, but the absence of much zoom capability was a deal breaker. If you don't mind using two cameras, then get an Elph for family photos and the sx 40 for nature photography. If you want, or can only afford, one, then this is the one, in my opinion.P.S. I did buy a second battery and charger, total about $7.50, which seemed like a small thing to me, because some reviews pointed out that battery life is short. I have not had to use the second battery yet, have only been shooting an hour at a time, and I haven't used the GPS, which stays on after the camera is off unless you specifically turn off the GPS. That will drain your battery. The battery and charger are both tiny. The chargers are about the size of a deck of cards with a turn-out plug. They go onto an outlet with the battery. The additional charger came with a car adapter, which is a great bonus on vacation. I also have a separate car adapter that can be used with the battery as well. I carry that for my laptop, tho I seldom use it. I never seem to spend as much time at the computer as I plan for, but the adapters are cheap, too.

I got it from a local warehouse for $199 with 4G card and a case and that's a very good deal.  The camera's price is now backed up to $230+ because of popular demands.  But I would even purchase at this price because this camera produces excellent IQ and still quite a bit cheaper than Sony Hx9v.  Compared to Sony Hx9v, this camera's ISO performance is one stop above that.  Even though it has smaller wider angle (28mm vs. Sony's 24mm) and shorter zoom (15x vs. 16x) but the IQ is the most important to me.  With the CHDK heck (just google CHDK), you can also shoot RAW as well.  Sony Hx9v handling is another problem for many users.  It is too slow and complicated.  Sony's strength is video performance, sweep panorama and slightly wider and longer zoom.  Canon's strength is IQ, creative effects and easy of handling.  I am bias towards Canon's strengths but for average P&S; user, Sony could be a good alternative as well.

I still think that the Sony HX9V and Nikon 9100 run the Canon very close, but this is the best choice for me. One major criticism of the Canon is that the GPS doesn't work well - I don't use it, so no opinion. What I really wish is that Canon had offered the SX220 - the same camera without GPS - in the US! Here's what I like about the Canon:- Excellent image quality (with the exception of purple fringing)- full manual control, PASM modes (one of the main reasons I replaced the Sony)- Intuitive layout, responsive controls (especially if you've used Canons before)- Good focal range (though less than competitors)- some fun modes: I like toy camera, fish eye and color swap as toys. The high-speed video is very cool, but lo-res (VGA), which is fine with me since it's a gimmick I won't use often- good screen quality- decent low light performanceThere's things I don't like as well, though.- battery life. It's pretty weak, and the reason why I originally got the Sony. Luckily, batteries are cheap online.- the flash is very weak, and only illuminates the closest subjects. EDIT: not as weak as I thought. You can adjust flash power, but turning it up DECREASES flash power, turning it down increases it.- the flash always pops up when you turn on the camera, and it's in an inconvenient place.- the screen is 16:9 ratio - great for video, not for pictures- the video quality is ok, not great (24 frames/sec in full HD, no refocus while shooting)- deleting images takes too many button presses -  a delete button would be helpfulUltimately, I think the Canon is great because of the image quality and the manual options. If you know something about photography, you will get more out of the Canon than out of the Sony or the Nikon. However, if you want a straighforward point and shoot, the Nikon is almost certainly better (though that has issues with long range autofocus and stabilization). If you want more, smarter options, the Sony is a better choice (but it suffers from slow operational speed and aggressive noise reduction - especially noticeable in portraits).In conclusion, I think the Canon is definitely a good camera, but whether it's the best for you really depends on your preferences.

You see, I have a 2 yr old and and a 3 month old, and I was beginning to miss photo opportunities by just owning a DSLR because a lot of times carrying such a camera around is a hassle, and I found that I wasn't taking it many places.  Enter the Canon SX230 HS.  All I can say is wow.  This is my most up to date point & shoot I've owned in years.  The last model I'd owned took not so great pictures, so I assumed that's pretty much all you could get in a P & S.  After getting more into photography and doing research, buying a DSLR and taking a photography class, I'd found out that all P & S's are not created equal--that there are \"high end\" p&s; cameras that could get you very good photos--even close to DSLR quality.

Every time which can be sort of annoying, but all you have to do is push it back down--or in my case because of the placement of the flash--I tend to accidentally have my finger on it when the camera turns on and so the flash can't open.  Doing that hasn't seemed to cause the flash any problems.Recovery time between pics seem a bit slow--but then again, that is probably not the camera and more a testament of my SDHC card.  I think it's only class 4, which we all know a class 6 or higher is gives faster writing speeds.I wish the lens could be a tad faster, i.e. f/2-f/2.8.

The photos under low light conditions were also great.I did not turn on the GPS so felt that the battery lasted well under these conditions.The pop-up flash is a little annoying since it opens every time you start the camera.  You can, however, hold it in a way that the flash just doesn't pop up if you don't need it.Again, the stabilized 14x zoom leads to some excellent pictures.  In order to accomplish this, the width of the camera lens has to go from 30mm to over 80 - Impressive!  I found the auto focus to be fast enough.  Still, the camera is VERY light and portable.  I would not carry a big SLR although I would love the pictures that come out of it.  This camera gets you a long way to SLR performance.The controls are fairly intuitive - I forgot to bring the manual but was able to easily navigate most features.  The review mode is very nice and the wheel allows you to move quickly between pictures.  I like to delete a bunch of bad photos before uploading to Photoshop Elements or Picasa and this camera made it easy to do.Above all, the pictures and videos are beautiful.

The Eastman Kodak \"Brownie\" was introduced back in 1900, with millions of Brownie 127 cameras sold between 1952 and 1967. The Brownie slogan was, \"You push the button, we do the rest.\" It was in 1948 when Edwin Land introduced the Land camera which became the Polaroid Land Camera. It was in response to daughter Jennifer's question, \"Why can't I see them now?\"At one time, it was all the rage, as when I was a kid film often had to mailed away for processing. Three or five weeks later, you finally knew who had their eyes closed or their tongues sticking out. My Dad still has his Polaroid Land Camera. Later, it became a niche market used by realtors and by my mentor, Ed Marlo, as you could approximate half-tones for publishing with a screened adapter.\"Point and Shoot\" cameras have always had great appeal. The Kodak Instamatic sold some 50 million between 1963 - 1970. In 1970, the battery-powered flash bulb gave way to the self-contained pyrotechnic wonder, the \"Magicube.\" The Kodak 110 format Pocket Instamatic came about in 1972, selling 25 million in less than three years. Times have changed, the last film camera I purchased was an Olympus 35mm Quickshooter Zoom, 35-70mm. By today's standards, it is monstrously large and heavy point and shoot, but back then it was living pretty large. We went through grocery bags of film shooting pre-illustrative photographs for several of my earlier books.Several AA-powered Canon PowerShots are still in the \"collection,\" with the PowerShot A610 featuring a humble 4x optical zoom and 20 scene modes to go with its 5.0 megapixels. As it turns out, \"megapixels\" are currently the pet rock of the digital camera world. We like more \"mega\" everything, but image quality come from lens quality and sensor size, not just cramming more un-needed pixels onto a tiny sensor. The Mega-Pixel Myth still rages rampant, even though 5 megapixels is more than most consumers could ever want or use, even going up to 16 x 24 posters as David Pogue was able to show in the New York Times in February, 2007.Every couple of years, digital cameras get slimmer, lighter, and more feature-laden. The bulbous old Canon PowerShot A610, long ago retired from the field, looks like odd plastic rock compared to the latest digital pocket cameras, that now actually fit in pockets.The travel zoom category was more or less pioneered by Panasonic, with the 2006 model Lumix DMC-TZ1. It was the first consumer compact to offer a 10x optical zoom. For the hunter, hiker, outdoors person, it is attractive to have a unit that is handy and pocketable, yet capable of grabbing both a dazzling sunset and having enough magnification to get to whatever wildlife is encountered. In preparation for this little article from an enthusiast's point of view, I spend some quality time with a Panasonic 8x (10x intelligent) zoom DMC-ZR3 made in Japan, a Sony 10x Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V made in China, a Nikon 18x Coolpix S9100 made in Indonesia, and a Canon 14x PowerShot SX230 HS made in Japan.One \"feature,\" worthless as far as I'm concerned, is a GPS included with your camera so you can bore people with clumsy maps telling them the coordinates you've been to, or just leave it on and wait for your camera battery to discharge prematurely. It is hard to find products without GPS's, meaning cell phones, binoculars, and even your GPS includes a GPS. It's really dumb, but it is called \"geotagging\" and it is nevertheless a feature. Of the cameras mentioned, the Sony and the Canon both have it. Sony takes the trouble to tell you what direction your camera was pointed in when you took the picture, not exactly wake the President material.The consumer based digital camera, as well as higher end cell-phones, have extremely small sensors. A 1/2.5 in. sensor is actually 5.3 x 4.0mm. Most of the latest cameras (including the Nikon and Canon) have a 1/2.3 in. sensor, or 6.1 x 4.6mm. None of these camera capture in RAW, minimally processed format that more interested photo-shoppers might prefer, saving the files in JPEG compressed format. All of these cameras capture 720 HD video as well, or better. The importance of that is up to the individual.Going down the line, it is easy to eliminate cameras in my terms, although obviously different folks (including the many fine dedicated photophile sites) don't always agree. The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V is close to a disaster, as it is turtle slow. I was able to get reasonably good output, but the camera is like a slow laptop with a lens, insisting on processing and saving at an irritatingly slow pace. It is even worse when attempting video, as it takes as much as 6 seconds before it so much as starts recording. Despite other gimmicks, like 3D shooting and a very good LCD display, this camera is just too slow to be a worthy hunting or outdoor companion.I purchased the \"Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD\" in June of 2011 for about $167. Since then, prices have crept to about $200, although there are newer models (Panasonic DMC-FH25K 16.1MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD) that can be had for $130 or so as of this writing. Slightly smaller and lighter than the rest, it is fast and takes excellent pictures in the \"dummy mode,\" my favorite mode. Though lacking the zoom range of the Canon and the Nikon, not having as large or as crisp of a screen, its long battery life (330 shots) and virtually fool-proof operation make it an excellent, reliable choice for the money.That leaves the two most feature-laden finalists, the Canon PowerShot SX230 HS and the Nikon Coolpix S9100. Both have upgraded, larger and crisper LCD screens. Technically, this is how they stack up, using essentially the same sensors.CANON SX230 HS 12.1 effective Megapixels (BSI-CMOS sensor)28-392mm equiv lens with optical stabilization1080p HD video and HDMI connection3.0 inch LCD with 461,000 dot resolutionISO sensitivity up to 320013 shooting modes, 11 Scene Modes, 11 Color ModesNIKON S9100 12.1 effective Megapixels (BSI-CMOS sensor)25-450mm equiv lens1080p HD video3.0 inch LCD with 921,000 dot resolution'Hybrid' VR image stabilization incorporating sensor shift and electronic stabilization (in video mode, sensor shift VR is disabled)ISO sensitivity up to 32005 shooting modes, 15 Scene Modes and 6 Effects modeThe great appeal of the Nikon is its 18x zoom compared to the 14x of the Canon. The Canon has a GPS, although a poor rendition of it. The Nikon is a bit faster, while the Canon does slightly better in high-ISO, low light applications. The Nikon shoots continuous drive at 9.5 fps compared to 3.2 fps for the Canon.Both have sharp LCD screens, the Canon a bit unusual in that it is a 16:9 aspect screen, more helpful for video than stills. Battery life is rated at 270 pictures for the Nikon vs. 210 for the Canon with the Canon's GPS turned off. Canon supplies you with a handy external charger, where the Nikon as supplied charges the battery in the camera (as did the sea-slug Sony). Extra batteries are invariably a good idea, but you'll need to buy a charger as well for the Nikon (and the Sony) if you want to continue to use your camera.For video, the Nikon shoots full-blown 1080p HD @ 30 fps, while the Canon stops at the inexplicable film frame rate of 24 fps. Both have fun and very usable slow-motion (240 fps) video modes as well, with the Canon's modes a bit easier to navigate to. Although the Nikon is better-handling in my view, it has build-quality issues. There is significant roughness, vibration, and noise when zooming, compared both to the smooth and silent Canon SX230 and the simpler Panasonic DMC-ZR3. Both the Nikon \"Night Landscape Hand-Held\" mode and the Canon SX230 HS (below) did a fine job with dusk / sunset photos, with an edge to the Canon in overall low-light performance.If you are on a budget and like the idea of long battery life, the Panasonic DMC-ZR3 (or similar Lumix models) fits the bill with an easy and effective intelligent auto mode. For a true 14x optical zoom range, more manual controls, the best low-light images of the group, along with a GPS of dubious value, the Canon SX230 HS wins this match-up on the basis of both features, performance, and build quality. Its battery life is a concern, particularly when shooting video or with the GPS engaged, so for most folks a second fully-charged battery at the ready will be mandatory. The SX230 is a thoroughly satisfying hunting and outdoors companion with little question.Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman.

It was brand new and had no reviews, so I bought it on Canon's reputation and the aforementioned features.  I did not have time to use it to check out photo quality before my trip but did take a bunch of pictures.  I liked the size, the zoom and the overall look, but found the buttons to be awkwardly placed, so much so that while taking pictures, I pushed various buttons unintentionally.  While in Italy, I thought the GPS function was cool and could see on review of the photos on camera that it gathered all available light for nighttime pictures.  If I turned the flash off, the pictures were not too dark and even though it was night my subjects were well lit.  The zoom was great too, but at the time could not tell how it would affect the quality.  Unlike many others, I found the battery life to be long-lasting.  I did have a back-up battery but even with taking pictures from morning until night never had to use it.  I don't know what others find acceptable in battery life, but I think that lasting all day is reasonable.  The GPS function just knows the coordinates, not the name of the place as I have seen in other cameras.  In the short term, this is okay because I remember each place, but in a few years will I still remember the location the picture was taken?  I doubt it, so it would be nice to have the name of the location in the meta data, but even that is not my complaint with the camera.When I returned home to view and print pictures, I found most of the pictures to be lacking detail and crispness.  They looked blurry, out of focus, and grainy.  My best pictures were nighttime photos, but even some of them were blurry.  I realize that I could play with the settings to try to correct this, and maybe that would help, but I bought a point and shoot so I would not have to do that. I had an almost ten year old Pentax Optio that I loved for the crisp, extraordinarily-detailed printed photos that I got but was a bit slow when taking TIFs.  I really don't know what the issue is.  I read on one of the reviews here about turning off the i something or another to fix overexposure and found mine to be turned off already.

Canon did a great job balancing noise reduction and fine detail. Lens distortions are not a concern, and chromatic aberrations are well controlled. An eensy bit of color fringing at certain apertures and focal lengths is apparent, but only when pixel peeping.The camera handles quite well, although it feels as though it could slip out of my grip a little too easily. The pop-up flash that annoys so many people is not an issue; the way I hold the camera to turn it on, my finger is already pressing on the flash. It didn't occur to me that I was keeping the flash from popping up until I accidentally powered the camera on while holding it one-handed. And went, \"Oh, yeah!\"If I could change anything about the SX230, it would be the LCD aspect ratio; I'd make the camera a wee bit taller and give it a 4:3 LCD. That's only because I have old eyes that don't see close up very well. Shooting in any aspect other than 16:9 results in a whittled down image on the display. Oh, and I'd make deleting pictures a lot easier. The way it is you have to go into the menu to erase pictures, and it's a four-step process.Bottom line: The folks at Canon have outdone themselves.

(again these are features and qualities that the sd1100 provides in spades) GPS worked fine and location finding was reasonable. BUT, in order to access the gps on/off or logging, you have to dig into the tools menu..the lower control wheel now has two menus, one is accessed by the slight touching of the wheel, the other by the full press. problem: right hand holding has your thumb meat resting above this, so the menu gets activated while trying to shoot. zoom is very slow, it can be sped up by fully pushing or pulling the zoom lever fully but takes effort and feels like your are pushing on it harder than it was designed to, i can forsee this wearing out or failing very very quickly. the camera is pretty heavy, but the overall construction is pretty solid feeling. the grip is terrible with the lens shifted to the left far enough to prevent the usual 2thumb pinch holding position of so many other P&S;'s. after awhile you get used to cradling the lens barrel but not good for those spontaneous photos on a tour as the bus passes something neat. again the sd1100 beats it here too. i think the worst part is the video..shoot at 1080p and you think cool!...then you try to open the file....quicktime movie format! ugh....can we say always has always will be the worst video codec out there? dropped frames at the camera level, no surprise considering the file format. various class speed cards did not resolve, 720p ok,but 1080p forget it...what bone head decided to change to .mov instead of the ubiquitous standard of avi?ending comments. if you want a good and reasonably priced camera get one of the canon SD or S lines and opt for the 5x zoom, keeping the beautiful focus speed, macro and lens quality. if you want a longer canon quality zoom with a full feature set, this doesn't have it....", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Defect with lens cover", "Author": "Flyer101", "ReviewID": "R1G6M043LWB5JE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was pleased with this camera's photo quality (particularly in low light), the zoom, and many of the features.

For instance I honestly do not get the necessity all of the sudden to geo tag each photograph you take.  Is that like a bread crumb thing so you can find your way back home? I don't get it. I started with a Kodak Brownie I got for Christmas almost 60 years ago. No geo tagging and wow it took really great pictures I really loved. Never felt like I was cheated by not having a geo tagging ability. Of course Sputnik had just been launched so that was a ways off.Why don't we forget all this new wave garbage and use a camera for what it was designed for, taking pictures. This is a wonderful camera. This camera is a full featured powerhouse camera masquerading as a point and shoot., it takes massive file size pictures with its' 14X OPTICAL zoom and they are razor sharp. And I know razor sharp having used almost every Canon camera since my first Canon the original F-1 in 1972 to the EOS 1NRS which I still use although I think film pretty much died when Kodak cancelled its Kodachrome film.As for battery life, you can buy extra batteries for next to nothing on Amazon or ebay which I did and I keep a couple in my pocket. Rarely have to change them. As for the flash, I normally put my hand there to hold the camera anyway so it never has a chance to pop up.And as for using the flash at night or in low light situations, I rarely if ever use it. This thing takes simply incredible pictures in low light and with its' image stabilization. Just make sure you hold it steady and gently press the shutter button....all things you would do with any camera. I prefer low light non flash pictures as there is a magic about them a flash destroys and the camera takes care of the white balance all by itself. I have been taking low light no flash pictures for 40 years and once you get the hang of it you will never go back to using a flash.This thing also takes incredible 1080 HD video and you can change from stills to video by pushing one button on the back of the camera, no jumping through hoops,. It is a truly amazing camera and I have had great fun with it for the over two years I have had it. If you are in the mood for a very capable camera that takes incredible pictures and really beautiful 1080HD video this one is a bargain at $250. And, unlike the SLRs with all the bells and whistles it will fit on your pants pocket. And yes I always enjoyed carrying around a  high end SLR with a motor drive and who knows what else attached to it, but it was an image thing, sort of who has the biggest camera, although they did take great pictures. After those 3 pound monsters this thing is a joy.Spend the $250 You won't be sorry. And while you can take this thing out of the box, set it on auto and never set anything else and it will take incredible pictures I suggest taking a small section of the instruction booklet at a time and reading it to see what you can really do with this camera....if you have the interest. You waste no film doing it so it is like free fun. Truth is I set it on auto and leave it there. You can't miss.Also I would buy a couple of San Disc Extreme Cards to go with it... 8 or 16 GB is enough. They have a high transfer rate which makes them ideal for video and I have never had a problem with either of the two I have been using constantly for almost three years.If you are looking for a camera that takes beautiful pictures and video and is easy to use this is it.Trust me (:o)", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Natalie \"NatalieSauter\"", "ReviewID": "R2FG5A2TACGG3D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me just say that I have gone through quite a few camera's and I am not easy on them either.

There is also what seems to be holes for a speaker, but (I'll explain later as to why) I am not sure what they are for. The flash is on the left side of the camera (when you are facing the screen) and it automatically pops up when you turn on the camera. Forcing it not to fire is as easy as pressing it shut. The circle button is the shutter button. Press halfway down to focus, and fully down to take the picture or start a video. The little nub at the front of the shutter button is the zoom control. To use it, put your fingertip overtop of the nub and pull it to the right to zoom in on something, and to the left to zoom out.On the side of the camera with the screen you have all of your important controls. The screen is not touchscreen, but is high quality. You'll find the on/off button clearly labeled on the top right corner of the screen next to the settings wheel. I will describe the various camera settings in the next section of this review. To make sure the setting you want is \"selected\", make sure it is aligned with the little white dash on the top right side of the screen. Underneath the settings wheel you have two circular buttons.

The one on the left has a red dot in the middle, and this is for starting and stopping video recording. The wheel below this is for playback mode mainly, to roll between various shots. The \"menu\" button is pretty self-explanatory, opens up a menu, and the \"dips\" button hides and shows the information on the screen when shooting.On the Canon PowerShot SX230 there are a variety of settings that each work beautifully in producing results you'll appreciate. You can let the camera do all the work for you, or tweak the settings around to create the results you want. The first setting is M which stands for Manual-in this mode you can tweak and change everything that the camera lets you, including ISO, Aperture, and the basics like flash and # of shots. The next mode is AV-Aperture Priority mode. This is personally my favorite mode because it really makes the subjects stand out and the backgrounds blur. You can change the F-stops. The next mode is TV-Shutter Speed Priority. This is ideal for pictures (for example, of fountains with water droplets) where you have things that are moving and you want to capture them in all their glory and with as least blur as possible. This is the setting where you can control your ISO speeds. If you want to capture faster things like fountains with droplets, you choose a bigger number. If you don't need that, go lower. Next setting which is P is one that I honestly cannot describe properly because I haven't used it. Next mode is AUTO. This is an ideal mode for beginners. Every setting is chosen to fit the environment of the picture you are taking. It is best especially if you are just trying to become one with your camera and want to learn how it functions before you take full control. The next mode is EASY mode. This mode makes the picture smaller, and has no settings available for you to change except auto-flash. Next is Movie Digest which is a cool feature-every time you take a photo in this mode it also records a short clip of before and after you took the photo to make a collection at the end of the day. It's (honestly) kind of useless, not to be harsh, but it is a cool feature, that is for sure. Next is Portrait, which I also prefer not to use in my work. If I am to photograph people, I just use AV mode to make them stand out. Landscape mode also doesn't change much. Kids and Pets tries to capture active subjects. Another cool feature (but very useful!) is the SCN mode. This mode automatically detects when you smile and snaps the shutter when you do. It's really cool, and actually works! We've used this with a timer on holidays so that we could all be in the shot at the right time. I love the next mode for creative shots of cityscapes and landscapes. It is called Fish Eye mode and gives you the effect of shooting a DSLR with a detachable fish eye lens all built in. It is really cool. It bubbles the center of the image for you and makes for funny shots of people. The last mode is Standard Movie shooting mode. Just know-you do not have to have Standard selected as your shooting mode to shoot video. Just press the red button and you're good. If you know your way around a Canon, just stick to M, AV, or TV modes to make the most out of your shots. If not, AUTO is just as good.I wonder why this is because the camera had been this way ever since I took it out of its box the first time but when I play back videos, there is no sound playing. I do not know if it is supposed to be that way or not, or if it is defective, but video would not play sound. This does not alter the quality, though. When you transfer the videos to your computer there IS sound playing. The video on this camera is AMAZING. I once recorded my young sister singing something on a road trip in the car. The windows were fully open, we were on a highway, and later on when I watched the video, I could BARELY hear any background noise. AMAZING! You can also zoom within videos and it makes it so easy to find subjects and shoot them.The battery is a Canon NB-5L 3.7 V pack. It takes approximately 2 hours to fully charge from zero and it will last you at least one full day of shooting. I have to admit the battery life is not as great as I would like it to be, it definitely is not nearly as long-lasting as the DSLR batteries (but take the same amount of time to charge) but it does the job.The card I used with this camera was a 16 GB Sandisk Class 4 SDHC Card. The videos and photos were saved in full high quality and maintained that quality on the computer. I recommend this card with this camera because it can store a ton of information.This camera is also very durable. I have dropped it once or twice, I admit, but it still works like a charm. The only thing that has broken since I first got this camera is the plastic bit on the string attached to it for you to hold it by. But seriously, that isn't important. It is durable, portable, and convenient. If you have your little daughter asking you, \"Mommy, can I take a picture?\" all they have to do is push a button and you won't have to worry about it breaking or losing functionality.The zoom on this camera is astounding. For such a small convenient camera, it really has perfect 20/20 eyesight and then some. It can see things through its lens that I cannot, even with my glasses on. It is amazing. The zoom is one of the selling factors of this camera. It is SO worth it. But that being said, the macro shots are still as stunning as any.If you want bokeh in the background or you want clear subjects with blurry backgrounds like a DSLR gives you, there are way to manipulate this camera into giving you what you want. Instead of standing right near your model, move WAY back (shooting on AV) and zoom in on them. They will be clear, the background will be blurred like a DSLR. Of course, this isn't the most ideal option because who wants to be 10 feet away from their model, telling them how to pose? For my beginner's work, this camera worked perfectly. And now that I've moved on to its older brother DSLR, I will definitely be bringing this camera along with me to shoot quick things or on trips that I wouldn't want to bring a heavy DSLR camera along with all its lenses. This camera is pretty much a few different detachable expensive lenses in one.I used this camera with iPhoto. No problems there.The startup is also really quick. Turn it on, and before you know it, you can shoot.This camera deserves 5 stars, hands down.I recently upgraded from a Canon PowerShot SX230 HS Camera to a Canon DSLR (the t3i) and even though the new camera will take the PowerShot's place as main camera, I am definitely still going to keep it. The entire Canon brand of cameras is magnificent and I will be sticking to them my whole life. This little camera is no disappointment at all.I recommend this camera to anyone. A beginning/ aspiring photographer who wants to grasp the basics; a mother wanting to snap high quality everyday pictures of her children; someone needing a small convenient camera; quite literally anyone. It's a simple camera that can go a long way as well as last a long time. It is definitely worth its price.Happy photographing!", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera.......someday I might use all the features", "Author": "J.

Milne", "ReviewID": "RVZHTKMEEZQG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off the question of the flash position many people complain about: It's a NON-ISSUE!  Just keep your finger on the flash and it won't pop-up!  It won't hurt the camera, read the manual.Now onto things that really matter.  You're looking at this camera because it's a compact zoom.  At 14x the images are really sharp, amazingly so for a small lens and camera.  But there's no free lunch, even with image stabilization you can't handhold at 14x unless it's a really bright day and you're shooting at 1/500 or faster.  And even then your hit rate for sharp shots will be low.  At extended zoom you have to use a tripod or brace the camera on a railing, against a wall, whatever.Pictures straight out of the camera at ISO 100 are really good, ISO 200 is fine, and ISO 400 and even 800 are OK in the brighter areas of the photo but you do see grain in the shadows and when \"pixel-peeping\".  However, this camera can produce very good photos up to at least ISO 1600 if you use CHDK which allows you to shoot RAW files, as well as providing exposure bracketing and other nifty things.  CHDK is freeware you put on your SDHC card that replaces the cameras firmware temporarily, just Google it.  It doesn't alter the camera permanently in anyway (it's loaded, if you want, when you turn the SX230 on and unloaded when you turn it off).  You can then develop the RAW files in Photoshop just like you would your pics from expensive DSLR cameras and get great results, particularly in low light, high ISO situations where the RAW developed jpg will be much sharper and less grainy/blotchy than the jpg straight out of the camera.  BTW, when set to shoot RAW the camera also takes its standard jpg, so if the picture looks good without RAW processing you don't need to bother with it.The camera is still very nice if used without CHDK, but having RAW capability (and bracketing etc) puts this camera way ahead of its point and shoot competitors.  CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit) is only available for Canons and there is no comparable software for Sony, Fuji, Panasonic, Nikon etc P&S; cameras that I'm aware of.I was deciding between the SX230 and either the Sony WX150 or HX20V, all of which I shot with for a while.  I got the Canon and after a recent trip realized that neither Sony, while nice cameras, could have come close to the picture quality of the Canon when shooting RAW.Highly recommended for your point and shoot travel zoom.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera!", "Author": "M.

It's just a question of going through the settings to find the old ones again.There's  even a few more options that I really like, like Super Vivid (perfect to take pictures of nature, but don't forget to change it when people are in the pic, because they end up really orange or red), or Toy Camera Effect.The position of the flash is no problem to me at all as it used to be the same with the IS210. It's just a question of habit. I do dislike the new way to erase pictures, though. It adds one more step to the process, which might not seem like much but is still a bit irritating.

During this trip it took many amazing pictures and did everything I wanted from it. It has a lot of really neat picture modes to choose from (though you will have to at least skim the manual to learn how to get to them all) and the GPS tagging feature is neat (though it will use up a heck of a lot of battery). The big seller though is the zoom (though if you use it constantly, it will run the battery down as well). When I was climbing Mont Blanc, I would take photos of wildlife and other scenery that we couldn't get too close to and my camera was always the envy of the group. This much zoom on something so compact is really invaluable when you're outdoors and traveling a lot. There was another man on this climb who brought a huge camera with a huge lens and he was constantly about an hour behind the rest of us and sometimes didn't make it at all.The only word of caution I have to leave you with is to make sure you keep the camera relatively safe from particles getting inside the lens cover. I think there must be a grain of sand or something in mine because the cover no longer opens and closes as smoothly as it did when I first bought it.So, if you want the best of both performance and size, I really recommend this camera. And for those of you who are not so extreme in your camera use, I've used it since then and it does really well in all kinds of lighting and with both fast and slow exposures. If you have really low light though, I do recommend getting at least a mini tripod or else your subject will be blinded by the flash and your photo will look really washed out. Take the time to look over the manual of this camera to learn how to use the different picture modes (and more if you want to really control every setting).

I held the camera over my head to shoot over crowds, yet I was still able to frame the shot using the LCD in bright sunlight.

The battery got charged within 2 hrs. I used my 8 GB card and I tested the camera after that. WOW, the camera zoom rocks. I captured the widest picture so clear without any pixel distortion. I like the product very much as it worked to my satisfaction. I'm confident now my August last two week vacation is going to be memorable. Thank you for everything.

This was an upgrade from a 5 year old Kodak camera, so it was obviously much better.  Wanted something that could take good pictures, HD video, and have at least a 10x zoom, but still be pocketable (all at around $200).  At the time  of purchase the camera was below $200 with memory card and case.  It went up shortly after that.  I was planning on eventually getting a separate HD video camera, but the quality from this Canon camera suits my needs.  It's nice to be able to go back and forth between video and camera with just the one device.As others have mentioned battery life can be an issue.  I have a couple of third party batteries as backup. Video will also drain it faster.  The battery life indicator is not very accurate - it only has three bars for a full charge and at times I have gone from 2 bars, down to zero without any warning. So always keep a battery with you.The GPS can also take a bit to get the location.  So even though I have that enabled, if I quickly turn the camera on and take a single shot, it doesn't always capture the location.  If I'm taking multiple shots, it will record the info on the subsequent pictures.I like the high speed burst, which is useful for pictures of my kids in their sports activities.  It does bring the resolution down to 3MP unlike the new sx260 model - which keeps it in full resolution.  But for my purposes - that resolution is ok.Overall, it's a good camera, and still haven't used all of it's features.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Feature Rich, Focus Poor", "Author": "S Good", "ReviewID": "R28G658HPGJDOY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been a Canon biggot due to a line of personal successes with the brand in cameras.  So I was excited last year to find one that had a lot of flexibility in features in an easy-to-carry form-factor.

After tinkering with many of the options and taking about 2,000 pictures I still haven't found a satisfactory picture taking experience with this camera compared to models of several years back.  The other issue I've found that even after a short time, the lense protector doesn't always retract fully, resulting in partially blocked images.

Yes it brings them in well, but it desaturates those areas poorly and their is an unattractive grey tone because of it..  The camera would be better off shooting raw and having the user adjust tones in easy free programs like Picasa and iphoto.Full HD: Actually this was pretty good.  Video and images are very clear and high quality when you are shooting in good to great conditions.  Maybe a bit saturated, but I can fix that in post if it really bothers me, and it hasn't yet.GPS:  Drains the battery and camera loses all power from a full charge within 2 hours, even if you take only a few pictures and are not using the GPS logger.  When you turn off the camera and turn it back on,  it will take 2 minutes to find the GPS signal at best.  It is not worth the time and battery suck.Zoom:  Worked well and is fast, but if you want a smaller increment of zoom, you will be going in and out to get it to where you want it.Screen: Nice size and vivid.Many other features of this camera are as worthless as the GPS because they drain the battery too fast.Because we bought this as a point and shoot and spent extra to have the GPS feature,  we feel a bit like it wis not worth it.  Do not buy this camera for the GPS feature.  And even if you don't use the GPS, still get a back up battery.

This camera has been a mixed bag of sorts for me, and it makes it difficult to write an evaluation.I desire to give it 5 stars for some of the impressive images I have taken with it, but problems with auto-white balance (and maybe exposure compensation, too) are causing me to downgrade this camera to three stars.Depending on the dial setting, I can take PASM shots on a tripod in controlled lighting and get different tint shades, and the photo brightness levels can vary quite a bit at times. Auto-mode works best, but I have seen times when an orange tint was present. Images shot in program mode usually come out looking too light, outdoors, and too dark indoors. I have resorted to taking a few shots - of the same subject - in several modes in order to find an acceptable image. I had no such troubles with the Canon SX 130.Image sharpness and detail is very good. This camera takes good movies, too, and I like the 16:9 screen for that purpose, but I wish the overall viewer height was a bit taller, as it makes it easier to see small wording - such as auto-ISO readings when shooting photos. Movie mode uses an auto-shake feature that works well. I recorded a few miles in stop and go city traffic while holding the camera with my right hand and driving with my left. I reviewed the 10-minute clip on TV without feeling motion induced eye fatigue. Be forewarned though, recording movie clips will drain the battery rather quickly, so I would encourage you buy a spare or two. http://www.amazon.com/1200mah-Battery-Replacement-PowerShot-Digital/dp/B000IWTHYA/ref=pd_sim_p_4There are too many bells & whistles to list them all, but one I like is the high burst mode. The SX 230 can take 8.1 images per second (non-flash mode) as long as you keep the shutter depressed. I shot a few seconds of my child in a rocking chair with said mode, and when I played the images back at high speed, it almost looked like a movie. Another good item is the auto-tracking feature in Auto mode. If selected (by a light press of the plastic rotating menu dial at the 12:00 O'clock position), a small white box will follow a moving object, and I sometimes use it to focus on a fixed background subject instead of letting the camera resort to using multiple green boxes to focus on foreground items.I think this is Canon's worst ergonomic camera. The flash location takes some getting used to as it wants to pop-up everytime the camera powers on, but light finger pressure will keep it retracted. If you find you need the flash, you can raise it manually with your fingernail, and lower it with the press of finger. The body finish has no anti-slip texture, and no raised finger placements, so be sure and wear the provided wrist lanyard in case the camera slips out of your hand (this happened to me once, and the lanyard kept the camera from hitting the floor).I have about two weeks left to review this model, and if I can't fix the white balance issue then I will probably send it back and buy the S95. A Canon rep talked like the white balance problem was a non-issue. What do you think? Is this the mark of a good camera? If it is, then why did I not have these issues with the SX 130? I don't mind changing things like exposure compensation for low-light shots, but I should not have to do this in normal lighting conditions in Program mode.

So I bought the SX230, due to my experience with another PowerShot.  As I expected, low-light shots are quick and clear.  The extra-wide angle end of the zoom is excellent for indoor group pictures.  Even so, it's telefoto ability is great for a camera that fits in my pocket.  If you're not using the flash, the camera is easy to hold with the left hand while you poke the buttons with your right.  If you're using the flash, it gets a little tricky!  The controls and menus are easy enough to use, but maybe I'm just familiar with them because I have an old PowerShot S3IS.  After dropping that camera three times on really hard surfaces, it complains every time I ask it to zoom, but it can still take great pictures.  I call that sturdy!

I can see what people are talking about with the flash - if you have your finger on top the flash when you turn the camera on, of course the flash does not pop up, so I have taken a few photos not knowing I didn't have the flash.  It is just a matter of holding the camera different when you turn it on.  That does make it easy to temporarily turn the flash off.  There are some additional features such as easier ways to preview pictures and take video without having to change the dial on the back of the camera.  I downloaded the manual prior to purchasing it so I could read a little more about the camera and it's features.  That was very helpful.  I wanted a camera with a rechargeable battery.

That said, my initial impression of this camera is that it is awkward to hold.  The biggest issue is the pop-up flash: it gets in the way of your left hand when you hold the camera normally and always pops-up when you power on the camera.  While you can push it down, there is a fairly strong detent that, if the manual hadn't specifically noted that you can manually push it down, I would have thought I was breaking it.  I guess I may be a bit harsh giving the camera only 3 stars for this, but All of my other Canon cameras (I have owned a total of 5 digital Canon cameras) have been ergonomically superior to this one.  I can't comment on the GPS feature and I just discovered last night there is a mode that captures a video snippet for each still picture so I'm intrigued by that (I just haven't played with it enough to make a judgement).Bottom Line: I'm on the fence for the first time with a Canon digital camera.P.S.

Possibly the dof changed but I'll have to push it a little harder with some more challenging dof requirements.  As others have mentioned the GPS does draw down the battery quite fast especially in log mode in a couple of short days for me. I did drop the camera once onto concrete from 2 ft or so.  It damaged the metal band near the flash but otherwise all works well.Pros:  Lightning fast start-up and shutter response.The GPS is handy.Very good low light performance. Not a bad price point.Cons: The GPS is handy but slow to acquire a location ( \u00b1 100ft) and draws down the battery fast.Weak flash.Colors get muddy in the fine details, yellows and green especially.

The flash is poorly located right were your left index finger would go if you held the camera with two hands. The flash pops out as soon as you turn on the camera...and you can't manually push it down either. The other area of bad ergonomics, and it is not limited to this camera alone, is the lack of a little bump in the front...the area where your right hand goes and wraps around the sides.  I personally find it very useful...makes it easy to handle it with one hand, and adds a great amount of stability. I have an old PowerShot SX110IS...and it has great design. I wanted to upgrade to a newer model which fits more easily into my pocket.  This one is pretty slick and slides easily into my jeans pocket, but the compromise in handling negates that benefit.

This was very disappointing, since I think the addition of GPS is something that would be really useful, or at least cool.In summary, if you're looking for a PS this size, you could do worse (though perhaps you really want an SX210)... if you're looking for a camera with good built-in GPS, look elsewhere.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Upgrade from Canon SD1100 is to SX230 HS", "Author": "Robert Lee", "ReviewID": "R32OMC4AEW4KNV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm just an amateur/casual photographer, but a fan of Canon camera.I just got the SX230 HS, and took it around for a quick spin today.

The SD1100 is small enough to carry around in my pocket, even when I am strapped into a rollercoaster; you have been warned.Yes, the flash pops up, when you turn on the camera. More so, once it is up, holding the camera is \"less than ideal\", verging on awkward. However, if you hold down the flash before turning on the camera, the flash will stay down. Unfortunately, you can't re-enable the flash once it is down, as far as I can tell so far.Of course, this is a far different camera from the SD series - captures 4:3 1:1 and even 16:9 aspect ratios, better low light capture. Oh yes, one can only take pictures via the screen; they took away the view finder. And yes, I do use the view finder on those occasions when the glare is extreme.This is Canon's n'th iteration of the PowerShot digital camera.

When you pan the camera horizontally or film fast moving objects like people walking quickly or close to the camera, or cars, there is a definite \"after-image\" choppy effect whereby one sees a \"trail\" of the moving object.However, on the good side, photos are very sharp, good colour and good exposure and so are the videos.  This camera has very very good overall image quality for both and if it was not for the disturbingly choppy videos at full HD (on a class 10 SDHC memory card at 20MB/s transfer rate), I would recommend it.

First of all the first one I got had a broken lens motor that couldn't focus but that was quickly returned.Let me start by saying the only reason I got this camera was for an alternative to lugging my DSLR around backpacking and so that I didn't have to manually geotag my photos after getting out of the back country.GPS functionality - well lets just say it sucks.  It took about 10 minutes to get a signal outside my home, but once it had it, it seemed to hold signal through turning it off and on and seemed, at the time to tag the photo pretty close to my house.  Once in the back country it was a whole different scenario.  I got GPS signal before I headed out on the trail, and it pretty much was fine the first 6-7 miles because I was taking pics quite frequently.  By the end of the day though, I must have moved a mile or something without taking a pic and it was a 6-7 minute wait to get signal, and it did it again at the other end of the lake I was on, and again the next day, all day....I don't have 6-7 minutes to wait between each picture, I fall pretty far behind the group, not to mention, my Garmin Oregon never lost location once when I turned it off an on at further intervals.  I'm talking a long wait for a signal above 10000 feet above tree line... It also defeats the purpose of a \"point and shoot\" camera...more like \"Wait a really long time, point and shoot\"  The worst part was about 80% of the pics that did get geotagged were almost spot on, the other 20% were off, sometimes up to half a mile or more off showing me on some mountain top that has no trail on it.  WORTHLESSSSSSSSS  I ended up manually geotagging the vast majority of the pics myself...exactly what I was trying to avoid.Battery:  Battery took a good 6 hours to charge which is borderline ridiculous compared to my 30D which takes about 30 minutes.  The battery doesn't last very long either.  Granted I had the GPS feature on, but I should be able to take more than 100 pics without the battery indicator ticking down.  The 2nd time I used it I got may 45 pics before it started ticking down.The Flash: Not only does the flash pop up every single time you turn it on, it is located right where you finger always is when holding it.  You can't disable this either.  What's worse is the flash is about as bright as a firefly.  Really really weak.  When it was dusk and used a flash at 5 feet, I couldn't even tell the flash went off in the pics.  Also, its hard to explain, but if you are in manual mode have your settings dialed in at really bright or really dark, and pop the flash up, the view screen illuminates to makes it look like it will take the perfect pic (the light is just right), but when you snap, its way to light or way to dark.  Putting the flash back down will re adjust the view screen to reflect the actual settings.ISO ratings: The ratings seem way off.  ISO 100 was never used because I could never get enough light on say, f5.6 or so, to get a fast enough shutter speed for things to not look blurry.  It was ISO 200 and above at all times, even in broad daylight.  Combine this with the flash and you are shooting on ISO 800+ in low light and will be lucky if the flash does anything.  Makes for terrible indoor pics.Picture Quality:  12 megapixels, whatever, the sensor must suck.  It might make a good 3x5 pic, but Im not going to blow anything up like I would with my 8 megapixel 30DAuto White Balance: Outdoor pictures at least, the AWB looked like garbage.

I am so glad I did.  My greatest frustration with the less-expensive point-and-shoot cameras in the past has been the lag time between when I depress the shutter and when the image is actually captured.  This camera does not have those problems.  When you fully depress that button, it takes the picture, it's that simple.  No more blurry pictures of my dog running out of the frame, or athletes' backs as they run away from me (use kids/pets mode).  I am no techie, but I was able to take a few decent shots just playing around before reading the manual on the disc that came with the camera.  Still, I would definitely recommend reading the manual just to see all of the neat stuff this camera can do.  I purchased this camera in the bundle with the replacement battery and the 16gb memory card.  Having that extra battery charged and ready to use should relieve the battery drain headaches some have experienced.  Another common complaint has been the flash placement.

It isn't bad, but turned out to be such a waste of money. Once I got a Canon SX100IS in 2008, I barely needed the camcorder; the compact Canon mega-zoom (10x optical) digital camera is superior even as far as movie capabilities go. I am neither an impassioned photographer nor an inveterate movie shooter, and the 8MP Canon SX100IS has been exceeding my expectations; great pictures in SuperFine mode (comparable, if the light is good, to what I'd seen taken with pro cameras) and crisp 640x480 resolution SD movies.Recently, I decided to move up to HD. Due to my previous experience, I did not even bother checking out HD camcorders once I found out there were compact digital cameras with HD movie mode out there. As my SX100IS still functions perfectly, the HD movie capability was the deciding factor to purchase a new camera. I was elated to find out about the SX230HS, with its 1080p24fps Full HD mode, and its 14x optical zoom (available while filming as well). Wasn't completely happy with the proprietary battery (the sx100 has two AA's), but went ahead with the purchase nonetheless (bought a spare battery, too).The reason I give the camera 3 stars only: even though I am happy with the movie quality (crisp, amazing Full HD for a camera this cheap), this camera doesn't have the SuperFine setting for pictures anymore (apparently, none of Canon's newer models does) and the Fine mode (other being Normal) doesn't cut it! Unless the light is optimal, the pictures in Fine quality are grainy and soft, even though the colours tend to be nice and realistic. So, I am somewhat disappointed. The main reason I gave up on buying camcorders was the possibility of getting a good camera with great movie capability (like the sx100is).

The ability to zoom in quite a lot is also very good. Because of all the options in shooting, you can be as manual or as automatic as you wish. Overall the pictures and movies it takes are very good for amateur photography.The Bad: As mentioned earlier, I chose this model specifically for the GPS function. That function is next to worthless. It's not a faulty part as I thought but actually the way it is built into the camera. Unless you are on a mountain top or in a open field, the probability is that it won't even see the three satellites it needs to provide the data. Worse yet, the data is only available in your computer and does not stamp your pictures like date and time. When it does function the information is so vague you may as well not have it unless you are a navigator by profession.The pop up flash is always in the way when you start the camera as this area is normally where your fingers go to hold it properly. Really poor planning on Canon's part.The button to start a short movie is in a really lousy spot to find unless you are looking directly at it and when you shut it off, you must \"bump\" the camera because of the obscure spot in which it was designed.Perhaps some of these features were improved in newer models but I am told the GPS is still just as lousy.I was also using a SONY GPS video camera on this same trip I just returned from. The Sony video camera took in the satellite information instantly whenever I was shooting outdoors and a local camera repair shop told me recently that the video cameras always do a better job at GPS then any still digital model. But the bottom line is that even in the video camera, the GPS information is only for the computer therefore worthless as part of making a slide show or movie and including a map as reference to your photography experience.Bottom Line: DON'T BUY GPS IN A CAMERA. If there is a similar model without GPS your saving money and a better value. Perhaps someday the camera makers will wake up and do something to make it worthwhile and powerful enough to do it quickly and stamp it to the shots you take. Until then, all GPS is, is a broken promise.So it was the lousy GPS that reduced the rating (mostly) on this purchase.Rare for me to write a lousy review on a Canon product as I have other Canons that are wonderful but in this case Canon deserves my ire.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Takes good pictures, but...", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "R2KOZNR4MMAQ27", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you're looking to use this for a lot of video you may be disappointed.

My friend took the same photo with his DSLR, but had to admit that my photo was equally good, and might even be better!Even the microphone quality is good.  I've used this camera to take videos of live a cappella concerts, and the sound quality is excellent, aside from auto-leveling effects (ie if the videographer makes a loud noise, the camera adjusts to pick up less sound from the singers who are further away).My only major complaint is the GPS.  It's a great feature when it works, but it will inexplicably stop working for weeks, then come back for a day.  So if you're looking specifically for a compact camera with GPS stamping, this might not be it.  Personally, I just see the GPS as a bonus feature, so if it happens to work, that's great!Overall, a fantastic camera -- it's like a DSLR, but without the bulkiness and the price!", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Mike Phillips", "ReviewID": "RN6HIUYCOS2IH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera works well.

This camera is small enough to stuff in a coat pocket and powerful enough to take those extreme telephoto shots with perfect clarity.  It even take videos of fantastic quality.  We were visiting an Alaskan island that we often visit during the summer to ride four-wheelers and to see grizzly bears and took some outstanding photos of a sow and her three cubs that were approximately 400 yards away - We've got beautiful, clear shots that look like the bears were within just feet!We're also into hotrods and drag races.

I've had the GPS feature turned-on but it has never synced and none of my pictures contain GPS info.  I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong or what, but it's simply never worked for me.Barring those two issues, overall, the camera is \"okay\".  Even with it set to pets/children, which is supposed to take quicker pictures and not take a long time to focus, sometimes it will not take a picture.  I'll press it half way (to focus) and then all the way down to take the picture, and nothing.  I'll try two more times and it'll take.

Even in 'SCN' mode, Taking a photo of the moon, at night, even using the requisite pre-set night mode, does not yield a decent photo.  My best shots were when I put the camera in Aperature Priority, fiddling with the aperature, and adjusted the ISO manually down to 100.  Then the camera was *significantly* *Faster*, like 1.5 or 2 seconds, as opposed to 10 seconds, per shot.  Equally impressive, was using the camera in Full Manual, of course.Fireworks on the 4th of July didn't prove to be as expected either.  After putting the camera in Fireworks mode, the shots I got were 10 seconds between exposures, and there was so much jitter that it didn't yield a decent picture of any of my shots.  Perhaps a tripod would've helped, but I did steady the camera against a support on my porch.  The exposure wait-time was interminable.What *really* surprised me was when a friend, who keeps her camera in Auto *all the time*, was taking crisper, sharper, and rich color shots - even of fireworks without being in Fireworks preset mode.  She takes all her shots in full auto using her inexpensive Canon SX130.  For point-and-shoot, with \"Canon Color\", (she takes incredible sunset shots, and landscape), the no-muss, no-fuss solution is the Canon SX130.I *love* my SX230, and all the options, advanced features and especially the flexibility it offers.  Unfortunately, I don't believe the firmware is setup very well for \"Auto\", or \"Easy Auto\", *or* the presets for the SX230.Has someone else had a different experience?  Perhaps my camera is bad?

I won't speak to the GPS as I really don't care and keep it off to conserve battery.  For a super zoom, this camera has what it takes.

I purchased this camera to fill a need for something small that can be put into tight spots (indoors, stage, etc.) I also have some work coming up with canoes on the lake and moving vehicle footage.  Tested the camera last night, great for photos. The menu is a little out of touch with the modes when going from video to still shots. I set the video format I wanted in the video mode, then swapped to the photo effects mode and hit the record button when testing different results. On the other modes, everything seems to go back to \"Auto\" when you hit the video record button. Not being able to dial in some of these things (ISO, AV, TV) will limit you, but you can always go into video mode and adjust the exposure bar for some help when shooting in HD.  My test for motion was simple, clamp mount and bean bag in my SUV. This is the same set up used for the goproHD, Xacti-VPC20, T3i, T2i, and larger camcorders I have tested in the past. The SX230 was set up the same way, with IS on, and at 1280x720 30p with a class 10 SDHC card.  Movement seemed to be a problem. On slow wide turns the camera could not keep the video clear. On the road, even on a smooth surface, 30MPH, and coasting (the money shot) the footage bounced up and down like I was on a gravel road.  This does not say anything bad about the camera, just that it has limitations and I will go with another that is much stronger for these conditions.  On a plus side, when the camera is stationary or handheld, I found it to work well within the range to produce quality video. The miniature feature (tilt-shift-toy car) was really amusing and produced great results as well as the straight HD video at 24p and 30p while stationary.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, Gave another as a gift", "Author": "happy camper", "ReviewID": "R2ERCI9YENOJO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, Gave one as a gift to a golf instructor who uses it for quick video's of clents so they can see every part of their swing.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "S.

Using the flash, for the same shots that were taken without the flash in auto mode:  The flash took great sharp pictures, great detail when you drill into the shot, compared to the non flash shots. I just needed to find a mode to turn on the flash.  I know there are benefits to not using a flash, but I like the crisp sharp details the flash produced.

In the case of this camera after a few shots I've noticed this tendency overall:- Camera tends to overexpose generally by about 1/3-1/2 stop.- There is noticable highlight clipping with this camera. It's average to a little worse than Panasonics in the same caliber.- Images tend to look very digital/video-ish rather than as genuine true-color, true-contrast images.- Macro mode is very fussy and has as many misses as hits in both focus and exposure.- The flash wants to pop-up just about every time you turn on the camera.  I now keep my finger over the latch when turning it on.- The cameras ability to register hues in the purple/pink part of the spectrum is very limited.  You end up getting tones which are much lighter and less saturated than they should be.  This would not be a good camera for photographing flowers in that part of the color spectrum.- Auto White balance indoors is pretty good.- Menu system is generally good except when deleting photos, too many clicks.  (It's hard for me to recommend Panasonic in particular over this camera because their menus look so ancient, largely unchanged in the past five or more years.)- Major functions of flash/exposure compensation/macro/self timer are NOT marked on the round dial in the back.  Canon, what were you thinking?This is an ok camera but not stellar.  I would not pay more than $225 new or $170 used for it.  If you shop around you can find better cameras at this price point.  And from what I can see the sx260 hs would be a definite pass due to quality control issues.  It's very common for Canon and other manufacturers to get a design just right (say on the A620) and then fumble in the next couple of versions.Canon is at a crossroads now.  They were extremely popular in P&S; up through the mid-2000's.  But they pulled the optical viewfinder from the A series (it has just returned in the A1200 which is closer in value to getting what you pay for then this camera), and frankly Canon has too many ELPH models just now.  The G series is too bulky now that M4/3 and others like DMC-LX5 are on the scene.  The superzoom sx40hs (whose body is just ugly compared to something like the Sony DSC-HX200V) exhibits a fatal attraction to zoom length (35x? you can't believe how much that hurts optical quality).  Only in the past couple of years have manufacturers learned that the number of megapixels alone is not the way to get quality people will buy.  And we'll see how long it takes for them to realize the same in zoom range. Somewhere from 10x-15x is probably the sweet spot for consumer super zooms. The S95/S100 is just a little too small to both hold and operate.If Canon were to reduce the current number of P&S; cameras from THIRTY to like FIFTEEN, and really focus on building in the quality, and getting the features just right, then they would be a much stronger company.  The CEO just resigned and this lack of focus (pun intended) on fewer but better models is symptomatic of what's going on in the company.  They have what it takes, very much so, but are not thinking things through.  Just cheap is not good.  Megazoom kills optical quality.  High megapixels (say over 7-9) in 1/2.3 \" sensors does not make sense either.Canon currently has NO really compelling P&S; cameras with a good mix of features and ergonomics IF you want some controls like Tv/Av/Manual and something more than 4x zoom.Now the T3i and T4i is another class of camera again, high recommended, but you have to want to carry around the extra bulk (and go with something like this Tamron AF 17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di-II LD SP Aspherical (IF) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras instead of the kit lens).But if you get everything else right in a camera and don't have any kind of viewfinder, something you can frame with even in strong sunlight, then you are selling customers short.  This camera does not have a viewfinder either which does not help it's overall value.At this price point (and of the current sx260 HS) I would have to say the Sony DSC-HX5V may be a stronger contender during 2012.  (I own a Panasonic FZ35 and FX37.  I recently sold my sx230 HS after having it for a few days and am looking at a older Canon A620 and A1200 instead.

The features that I most wanted were zoom, GPS, and compact.  Camera meets those needs.Agree with others that flash is in awkward place.  GPS even records altitude which was a pleasant surprise.histogram, grid, OIS, one button movie record were all features I expected and it has.I have had a Lumix ZS 3 (previously my \"travel\" camera, until black spot appeared on all the photos on my last trip), Canon S80 (great sturdy build, still clear pictures but zoom isn't as long) and Canon IS 780.part that I am most disappointed in was the lack of a \"voice memo\" feature.  it has been present on earlier Canon point and shoots (e.g. S-80 and ixus 780, it takes movies with audio, so is capable of recording audio, so why not keep that feature?  The voice memo feature is useful reviewing pictures at the end of the day, making notes on them, before you forget where you were.  The GPS was supposed to help with that but... see below.I would have rather have kept that feature instead of the in camera color \"tricks\" features that have been added.... those \"tricks\" are much easier to do with a computer anyway.other wise appears to be a very nice camera.addendum:  after using for 3-4 trips, over 5 months, the GPS is slow and unreliable.

Not a very good trade-off in my opinion, and even those low light shots are underwhelming to say the least. Most low light shots taken without the flash are still quite grainy, and most have an amber tint.Battery life on this model certainly IS all it's cracked up to be. In other words, it's dismal. The battery is quickly depleted and takes a little more than two hours to charge. You might also find this excerpt from the owner's manual section on charging the battery interesting: \"The battery may develop a bulge. This is a normal characteristic of the battery and does not indicate a problem. However if the battery bulges to the point where it will no longer fit into the camera, please contact a Canon Customer Support Help Desk.\" (p. 15, bottom paragraph). Couldn't a major player like Canon come up with a better power solution than a battery with a known design flaw? What if the battery develops a bulge while it's in your camera?What about the meat and potatoes of any camera review, namely photo quality?Most of several hundred images I shot were blurry, grainy, and either washed out or amber tinted, depending on which settings the camera automatically chose based on shooting conditions. There were, admittedly, a few exceptions. They were brilliant, and if those exceptions were instead the rule, I'd be raving about the camera instead of panning it. At least the potential for that kind of photography is there, so I'll give it this: it has potential. But we aren't paying for potential, we're paying for performance.This camera frequently chooses inappropriate focal points, focusing on extraneous items in the composition space and blurring the intended subject. Sure, lots of shots taken with this Canon look pretty okay until they're viewed at full size on a computer screen. Then they're grainy as heck, with way too much loss of detail. I'm not talking about enlarging images, just about full size viewing on a computer screen, which is how all my photos will be viewed (on a computer screen).The position of the flash on the camera causes it to be obstructed by the extended lens when shooting close up/macro, resulting in the lens' shadow being projected on to the subject. That's the worst of it, but there's another problem with it that most reviewers have already pointed out - it's an ergonomic disaster. Because of its placement, there's just no good way to hold the camera stable when shooting. If you're not careful when you're turning the camera on, you'll wind up preventing the darn thing from even opening with your finger. The flash isn't just in a bad place on top of the camera, it actually curves around the corner just enough so that even when held on the side, you can easily obstruct the flash, causing it not to open.As far as all the tweaks and features, I bought the camera in spite of those, not for them. I couldn't care less about GPS, I'd NEVER settle for editing my photos on a tiny 3\" screen, and I hate cheezy effects, which I find most on-board effects to be.On the positive side, Canon's photo import and edit software is really quite good compared to others, including my old Kodak's. Importing images to your hard drive is quick and as easy as pie. Basic editing tasks are too.No doubt some will tell me which settings I should have used and which ones I should have tweaked, but that's hardly the point of \"point and shoot\", is it? Granted, being able to tweak basic photographic settings comes in handy for shoots that are planned ahead of time, but shooting on the fly requires speed, and there's nothing speedy about navigating the complicated menu on this camera to get to those settings. I didn't buy this camera for studio work, I bought it for its supposed point and shoot capabilities, and they are woefully inadequate.My experience with Canon digital cameras has led me to conclude that they're overhyped, but there's no denying that they have a loyal following nonetheless.

This feature would deserve to take one star from the mark I gave in the first review, leaving it at two stars only.  But, I must confess that this feature gave me a really good laugh, so I keep the mark at three stars :-)Needless to say, I will never switch the GPS on again.

Big mistake - returning today.While the features of this camera *on paper* are great aside from the somewhat slow 3.1 lens, and I had testdriven the camera in a couple of local shops, you just can't get a feel for cameras until you take them out and put them through their paces for your own use cases (we're all looking for something somewhat different here).My current camera to beat is a Canon SD870is. I have tried many cameras, notably, Canon SD4500, Nikon 8100, Nikon 9100, Fuji EXR550, etc.. and have returned every one because they just cannot do the one thing I need a camera to do:Very quickly from cold take pictures of kids indoors and out. In a pocketable size.That's all I want. While I am a techie geek and can appreciate all the manual controls and \"fiddle with this and that\" stuff some of these micro-cameras have today - that is completely useless to me - I'm never going to use it, much less anyone else in my family. I just want a very small, very fast, very good picture quality, easy to use camera.The SX230HS leaves sooo much to be desired. First, it is a beast (for a pocket camera) . You're a hair away from a micro 4/3 camera at this point. Costwise it has an advantage though.Regarding my single use case \"fast in low light\" - it is a catastrophe. I could not get a shot of moving kids, dogs, practically anything. Half the time the camera did not take a picture even when the shutter was fully pressed, some of the time it took a picture a couple of seconds later after it was done \"thinking\" - prefocusing did not help. The pictures it did take were blurry and if not blurry, they were unbelievably noisy for a camera of such vaunted fame - not any better than the cheapo $70 Samsung camera I bought my daughter to play around with. All of the other cameras I have tested have at least taken a shot, even if a bad one, so you get maybe part of the funny performance your kids were doing, but this camera just doesn't take a shot at all. IT is very odd.SO, I figured maybe I'm asking too much and I took the camera to a soccer game with me. On a sunny day, the camera missed shot after shot, usually because it was \"thinking\" and trying to figure out which autofocus pattern it was going to use and who knows what. But the moment was gone. At superzoom, the camera was barely usable with poor stabilization - better then the Fuji 550 though. Any camera can take great shots outside in the sun, even a throwaway - I have never been so exasperated.Of all the cameras I've tested the Nikon 8100/9100 work the best - they just have poor User Interface, noisy zoom motors, and all the other quibbles noted in the reviews. The Fuji was just overhyped and a last gasp for a once great company. RIP Fuji.At the end of the day, nothing beats my SD870is. I just wish I hadn't sat on it while mountainclimbing with it in my back pocket. (LCD screen is half there now - camera is still fine). Oh, wish it had a little more zoom.I think if the camera companies would get back to the basics of just taking great shots we wouldn't need GPS, 40 different \"scenes\", infinite user fiddle control (get an SLR for pete's sake if you want to screw around with this). Just like they should stop stuffing megapixels into the chips at the expense of image quality.Battery life was ok for me. The flash is VERY annoying - I've tried a lot of cameras with popup flash and this one is bad. If your finger is on it when you turn it on, it will never pop up, you have to turn the camera off and then on again = missed shot.In short: too big and too slow, not a value even at $200...my cellphone camera is practically as usable.

I've owned a few cameras in my day... never once has this happened to any other and they have been far more used and abused than this one.Being under warranty I mailed in the camera for service of the lens issue, but also reported the image quality issues. 15 days after USPS confirmed delivery they finally opened the box and confirmed their receipt of it. Several calls during that window turned up little information, other than one combative & abusive 'support' rep who repeatedly said that USPS frequently 'lies' to customers about when packages are delivered.When the service was done I did not get an email. Only by randomly looking at the tracking website did I see that they had completed repairs and mailed it back.Upon receiving my 'repaired' camera back, I was infuriated to see that the image quality issues remain. Later when I received the typical survey emails about my support experience, I shared my extremely negative feedback and much to my surprise, no one there has yet to attempt any sort of follow-up to try to get to the bottom of what the issue is.If I wanted to tweak every setting under the sun to take a decent photo I would do so... I explicitly purchased a highly rated point and shoot so that I would not have to.I'm told that Canon makes good DSLRs... I cannot speak to that. All I know is that I regret ever buying this camera, let alone doing business with Canon as they demonstrated time and time again that they are not serious about making a quality point and shoot, let alone standing by their product.While I do use this camera from time to time as it's zoom is quite good... I've come to use my cell phone more often than not as it at least takes photos with a quality that is consistently better than my SX230HS.One last thing... the physical quality of the camera is also extremely lacking. The black plastic is just painted on top of a base silver layer, while the silver trim (around top & side) is just silver painted on top of black... this means that no matter where you get a small scratch or dent... the opposite color will show up, making any kind of dings far more obvious.In review:1.

I own an upper end Canon DSLR camera and was looking for a more compact camera to use as my \"take every where camera\". This camera did not fit the bill. It came with a ton of features that the photo inthusist, semi-pro photographer and pro photographer would appreciate in a compact camera. the downfall is the image quality. I have taken photos in all settings this camera has to offer under differant lighting situations and every single photo comes out with to much noise to bother using for anything other than common internet sharing. The price you pay for this camera is deffinantly for all the manual options and NOT for the image quality. If your looking for the everyday point and shoot with some nice manual options then this camera is nice in that respect compared to other pocket point and shoot cameras. If your a serious about your photos and would like to utilize a point and shoot for your \"take everywere camera\" then save up the extra $150 bucks and buy a canon G12. I got rid of the reviewed camera here and went with a G12. Although the size of a little bigger on the G12, the image quality is actually comparable to my 7D DSLR. Had I spent no more than $200 on this powershot xs230 then my review might have been differant. For the money though, the images are quite horrible. As stated before, save up an extra $150 and get the G12. It's not a compact pocket camera but it is in the catagory of compact non SLR cameras and the images are outstanding.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazon ripped me off on return", "Author": "RRR", "ReviewID": "R3TJBIUJ5HGKMX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this item.

Our main interest was a portable camera for International travel that has similar features to the pro equipment that I use at home.  The image quality is not as good as the pro cameras but certainly passable for snapshot applications.The problem is that there is no suitable Canon user guide provided.  They provide a CD with a pdf of the manual suitable for viewing on your computer.  You can also print it out or Canon will provide the manual in 8 1/2\" x 11\" format that is much larger than the pocket size manuals they previously provided.  If you carry a smart phone or pad computer you can reference the pdf file there.The solution is to take a camera case large enough to hold the manual if you want to look something up in the field (a certainty for a camera with these capabilities).  You can put the camera in your pocket.  Incidentally Canon will not take returns for any camera because of the manual.  They have shrunk the cameras and enlarged the manuals.
