My wife opened it(was for her anyway) and started charging the battery. That afternoon I came home, picked it up, popped the battery and sim in, then took a few pics..I have loved this camera since.It's super-light weight.Touch screen is very responsive. Maybe too much.. but can that really be a bad thing?and most importantly, it takes fabulous pics!I haven't used any res other than 10mp, but why would you?Anyway, I could ramble on about it for a while..for $45(refurb) what I paid, what an awesome deal.", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Fave!", "Author": "Cnortorious", "ReviewID": "RLKPT196VT4S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant about buying this camera but kind of wanted a touchscreen camera. the quality of this camera was great.
