The seams/thread on the inside is a mess. The bag holds my t3i, 18-55mm, canon 50mm, 2 filter kits, extra batteries. This bag will be limited to carrying about 2 lenses max. Outer appearance is good. It has many outside pockets.Tripod: Somewhat flimsy but I mainly use the tripod for inside use so it worked out for me. The top portion of the pod comes off with a lever, you can screw it onto your camera body and lever it back into the tripod. Comes with a carrying case which is a plus.Extra Battery: is NOT a Canon battery but it does what it supposed to do.All in all I'm glad I got this package.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera.", "Author": "Donald Edwards", "ReviewID": "R1FTDJJTA7J0MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has some of the best features, as well as being an incredible purchase.
