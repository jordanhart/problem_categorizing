It said, that this camera body would fit my 35 mm camera lens.  Well I only took the body out of the package and when I saw that my lens did not fit.  I packed it back up to return it. The package and all it's contents were in pristine condition.  So I take it to the post office and they have a new policy that if a package arrives damaged you should not open the package and that I should inform the receiver of that new rule.  If you open the package it void the insurance that I purchased for this package.  I contacted the seller and he sent me a email back that said(If there is anything at all broken or missing inside the box we will go to amazon not USPS. We hope that you have shipped back this package in its original condtion. if not we will file a claim with amazon against you.)Yes this was the email I received from ZeeMo . I was only trying to let them know what the Post office told me.Now I rated this only one star because of the way that ZeeMo treated me.  I can say that the camera and everything in the package was nice but ZeeMo is not a good company to deal with.  There are other companies on Amazon that offer the same set and you would be better off buying from one of the other companies.  By the way I have 20 witness's that saw I did not take anything out of the package only the camera body and they were there when I taped it back up to ship back.  So the fact that these jerks would accuse me of being a theif and of damaging this package was beyond belief. I think they were angry that I could I am returning this order.  I made a mistake believing a review that said, I could use my old camera lens on this body and that was for the body only.  I then saw this set with that same body and decided to order it as it had all the items I needed.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005703G40"}}
