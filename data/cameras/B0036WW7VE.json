give it a shot. I am very pleased that I did. I read that the colors were bad, but the color is great. I also read that the distance at night was only half of what the product claims, but the distance is at least 90 feet.I am very pleased with this purchase and if I need another camera in the future, this camera will be my first option.Here is a compiled video that I took using this camera from two different places. One is at night and the other during the day. The fence is about 70 feet from the camera during the night shot. As you can see, the cat on the fence is easily seen from that distance. The color during the day shot speaks for itself.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you want security - forget it", "Author": "Junior111", "ReviewID": "RTH61BBCYR4KG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to upgrade my Security DVR from 420DVL cameras to something better. I found this camera and good reviews and ordered one. The daytime color improvement was impressive when compared to the 420TVL.  I ordered 2 more of this model. One of those was basically dead on arrival. It didn't work at night. I had to return it. Amazon refunded fast.  Then the second camera started to blink in and out, especially in the transitions between dawn and dusk. It takes several minutes of in/out/no signal blinking before the picture stabilizes. If you need any footage in emergencies it would be worthless.The locking mechanism is also not well thought through. I have a location were some Blue Jays want to sit on top of the camera, and every time they do the cam position  needs to be re-adjusted. This is only good for you if you need the exercise to schlepp a 10-foot ladder around to adjust several cameras in hard-to-reach places.  All in all I hate to say this: I would give this camera a minus-1 if I could and I do this very seldom to any product. But when 2 out of 3 cameras are not working properly you are wasting valuable time and money. Finally I upgraded to a 600TVL camera for barely $10 more than this one and the 600TVL works flawlessly, much better resolution at day and night. For peace of mind I would recommend  cameras with a minimum of 600TVL and CCD system.

In daylight clear images to 100 feet with ease. Much further, resolution is again an issue. There is a mechanical relay that switches between B&W;/IR LED's or an IR filter for daylight. There is some twitchiness to the relay during transitional periods, not a problem in my opinion. Other IR devices such as security lights may be hampered by the camera's IR output, it is significant. Reduced sensitivity in affected devices usually compensates. This is the best performing, low cost IR camera I have found. I am quite satisfied.

Of the two I bought, one had fairly crisp(contrast) night vision but poor visibility overall due to poor 'lighting' from the LED's.The second camera had good day pictures but the night vision was non-existent. I'm guessing the problem with both cameras was due to faulty IR LED's.A little FYI. I have found the cameras with the better mounting bracket to have better quality cameras.

The inside light view was fuzzy looking, outside better picture, and night time was close to being washed out (very light) and hard to see much of anything. I made brightness adjustments to the camera from inside the DVR and the camera night viewing improved significantly. The outside distance with daylight was fair to about 90 feet viewing.
