The shutter sticks closed when you turn it on. The shutter sticks open when you turn it off.It does take good photos-when it works properly.I tried contacting Amazon, Pentax, and the seller of the product for either a refund, or guidance on how to get a replacement or repair. None of my efforts have been successful. I am stuck with this piece of crap and wishing I had just spent more on the Canon.Don't waste your money.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "my second digital camera", "Author": "wisho_o", "ReviewID": "R19LJR4WX7QWOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love it!! very small and turquoise color :)the colors come out great ~there's these mini built in frames option in the camera very cute~!loving this camera!", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "14-megapixel sensor; wide-angle 5x optical zoom lens (28-140mm)\nSensor-shift Pentax Shake Reduction (SR) system; Movie SR keeps motion video steady\nCapture widescreen 720p HD video\nElegant design with an ultra-compact footprint\nCapture images/video to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)\nElegant design with an ultra-compact footprint, featuring soft curves, rounded edges, and a highly polished, reflective surface in chrome, black, or green.\nHigh resolution 14 megapixel sensor ensures exceptional detail in large print sizes, and provides flexibility when cropping an image.\nWide angle 5X optical zoom lens (28-140mm) offers great framing flexibility for subjects near or far.\nSensor-shift PENTAX Shake Reduction (SR) system helps keep images tack sharp, even in dim lighting, while Movie SR keeps motion video steady.\nCapture widescreen 720p HD video when a still image just isn't enough to record the essence of the scene.", "Name": "Pentax Optio 15936 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom (Green)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sPaWHDIUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004OSCWJG"}}
