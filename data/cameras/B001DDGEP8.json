Pulled wires through conduit. Wires are very weak so don't try to pull them very hard. One would keep losing signal when i stuffed wires in conduit box, when i finally got it working the power wire shorted out and almost melted jacket around plug. I had to cut the jacket off and retape wires and it worked fine after that. I used 3/4 conduit but if I had to do it again I would use 1 inch conduit to ease the stress on pulling wires through.Also don't forget to lube the wires if pulling through conduit. The video feed is pretty clear.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Video cables", "Author": "jose araujo", "ReviewID": "R31W3JX13QEL6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love it because it gave me more length to get the job done.I am installing all this cameras to try to discourage the thief, and let them know we are watching them.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extra cable", "Author": "Charlotte Manuel", "ReviewID": "R37S7H9G7AM01P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "extra cable helped hook up cameras on the back of the house.

Go to one end of the field and with the bundle of cables in your hand separate the ends that have the connectors in a big V, one end to the right (camera) and the other end to the left (VCR). Now walk backwards toward the other end of the field unwinding the bundle in a rolling matter until you get to unwind the whole thing. Make sure that when you are walking backwards, you keep the lines separated. When you arrived at the end of the field, your whole 150 feet will be laid in front of you, now grab one end and get to work on your installation...ask your wife for a recompense ...lol ;)", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "tangled mess", "Author": "J.
