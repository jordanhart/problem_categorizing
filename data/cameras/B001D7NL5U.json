I read all of the reviews and everything seemed great accept for the wireless range.  After setting up the system (w/additions camera), all looked great.  Setup was easy and directions were clear.  The night viewing range was good and the reception range was better than I expected.  Initially I was very happy, but after a few days of use I noticed issues with the picture.  One camera showed a clear picture while the over was almost completely washed out and at night showed very blurry.  And a day after rain or snow, both camera were fogged for a few days.  No big deal I thought, I just have a defective camera(s).  Unfortunately after replacing the one bad camera, the second camera was now washed out and barely visible.  So I figure lets give it one last try and replace the second camera and LCD receiver.  Again, same issues.  Bad picture on one camera and perfect picture on the other.  I finally gave up and returned everything to amazon.  Now I'm back to square one.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good", "Author": "B.

The picture quality is good and it seems to be well built.I read the reviws for the other SVAT camera system that says you have to plug in the monitor behind the batteries and that it uses AAA Batteries. I thought I would try this camera because it has a rechargable batery and a base that you can set the monitor in while it charges.I am very happy with my purchase. My expectations were really high but this thing does work well.

It was great while we had it, but the camera seems to be sensitive to humidity and outside temperatures.We bought this for one specific purpose.  To see who is at the front door.  Our porch is situated such that you can not see who is at the door from any window.Our other Electronic Devices:  Wireless Internet and Cordless Phones.  No issues with the camera/monitor or our other devices.  Both the wireless and phones are 5.8Mhz which may be the reason we had no issue.Setup:  I had the camera on a nail above the door in 5 minutes.  Briefly skimmed the manual and we were off.  We tested for a couple of weeks both in daylight and night to get the placement right.  Note:  If you are buying strictly for night vision...don't.  It doesn't work more than a couple of feet. Our porch has a motion detection light in the ceiling so this works perfectly with the camera.  We have tried the monitor sitting in the cradle, walking around the house and connected to the tv.Results:  On our first test, my wife loved it.  She was able to clearly see who was knocking.  The range is pretty small and it does degrade rapidly with walls and doors between.  Our setup is basically 20 feet from the camera through the front door and outside wall.  Moving to a back room with 2 inside walls produced quite a bit of interference...we could see but the image would flake out every few seconds.  We also do not use the sound activation since the camera is outside it picks up any noise on the lowest settings...For the price and ease of use...it fits our needs perfectly.  It really depends on how you plan to use it, if it will work for you or not.  If you need long range or strict night vision...this is definately not the system for you.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life", "Author": "McLean, VA", "ReviewID": "R1IZVEDLDPDJRA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it stated you can use a 9 volt battery.  After installing it and being excited with good range and good quality picture, I was diappointed that the battery died in 4 hours.  I replaced the battery thinking I had an old 9 volt and it died again!  I emailed the company and they stated that it was functioning as designed and the battery life was only for a maximum of four hours.  Because I did not want to drill a hole through my brick exterior to have the AC adaptor plugged inside (I was using this as a front entrance camera), I had to return the camera.  If you have an easy means to plug in the AC adaptor, I would recommend the camera.

After charging the monitor for a few hours, I powered up the camera and it works fine.  Good wall penetration with this system - I have walked around 90 feet from the camera with the monitor and the picture is still viewable.  The audio is pretty sensitive as well.  The night vision is adequate for a short distance, probably 10 - 15 feet in total darkness maximum - fine if you have the camera mounted near the door and want to see who is there.  The night vision range could be further extended with the use of an additional infrared illuminator, however the resolution of the camera is not really adequate for a distance shot.  The camera is housed in a metal enclosure and seems high quality.  The handheld monitor unit is plastic and acceptable quality.  The built in lithium battery does not seem to be user-replaceable.  I have not opened the device to see if it is soldered into  place, but I suspect that it could be changed with a little tech savvy.  The unit will probably operate from the supplied ac adaptor even after the battery fails.

Bottom line is that if you keep it running 24/7 you will cause your unit to run hot and will shorten the life of your battery.

It really is wireless, I guess I'm spoiled having only ever dealt with the old standard wired security cameras and there is a world of quality difference between the two. The snow on this system is incredible, the unit's description clearly shows images of the cameras being mounted on brick exterior walls, well, good luck getting reception with that.Indoors the quality was almost bearable unfortunately that was of no use for me.The system is suppose to utilize 2 cameras and with the hand held base/monitor it alternates between the cameras, even with every possible configuration imaginable I can get either one camera to work but, never both. They're both broadcasting but, I get one image then snow, move the monitor around and maybe get the other camera's image then lose the first camera's image.It's like chasing your tail. I even stood in direct sight of both cameras outside and it still looks like a blizzard.I can see this system possibly working for a baby camera, indoors, things might work out for you. Make sure the base unit isn't far from the camera and, avoid being suckered into adding a second camera. This system is lucky to work with the one camera, the two camera feature should have been scratched.For the cost, you can easily purchase the old standard wired camera (network or coax), granted you have to run the wire and power but if your security is really your concern, you'll find it easily worth the effort. Wireless is cute and easy, if that's really all you want then you might be fine. For all others though, avoid this setup.I've returned this system for refund.

It gives a clear picture and depending on the lighting, influences the color quality, in a well lit room the color is good.  This is no HD by any means but no worse than a non HD camcorder.  I leave the camera plugged in so I can't attest to the 9V battery life and the monitor will run at least 4 hours on a full charge. The microphone is also very sensitive to noises so I mainly have mine turned down, it easily can pick up voices in another room.I'm very happy with this product so far, its only been a week but I have no complaints.

Although I think I will appreciate the portability of the hand held unit.As the sun was going down, the colors improved significantly but the 'snow' continued. After dark the streetlights added 'hot spots' to the image.

I was very worried about SIDS so we wanted to be able to see him without waking him up.  We really like the Defender because it has night vision and sound.  I like the holster to charge it in, we just leave it next to our bed.  We have had a lot of static issues with it however, and just two rooms away the alarm starts to go off.  I like the alarm when it sounds in the night because we are sure to wake up if he starts to fuss, but during the day when he is just fussing and doesn't want to go to sleep I wish there was a way to clear the alarm and just listen at leisure.  Unfortunately you can only turn the sensitivity down a little.  The only other thing I wish it had was a belt loop holster.  Other than those few minor things we LOVE it!!!

It lasts for an few hours at most. So connecting it outside is just about impossible unless you live in a really dry area where you could plug it in to an outside outlet. The AC adapter that comes with it is certainly not weather proof.If you are looking purely for an indoor camera to monitor a room (baby, kids, etc.), this would work OK. I suppose it would work OK to monitor your pool or something like that outside if you could plug it in someplace away from weather and water.I purchased two cameras wanting to monitor my front door and driveway. I have one aimed through a window near my front door. This works fine during the day, but at night the \"night vision\" reflects off the glass so I get no image. The other I was able to rig looking through a bedroom window towards my driveway, which is a well lit outside area. This one works pretty well even at night, but it doesn't cover my front door, which is what I really wanted. I had to move this second camera a good distance from the window so the night vision wouldn't reflect back.I do think the manufacturer is being very deceptive when they call this an \"Outdoor Surveillance Camera\". Sure, it will work outside with a 9 volt battery, but you would need to change the battery every few hours, which is not at all practice. If you are good with electronics you might be able to rig this some way to actually work outside.", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "just my luck to make the wurst possilble choice!", "Author": "Kid Icarus \"The Lad from Hades\"", "ReviewID": "R23QCWN6YYYEN9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "though the camera(when absoultely no interference or cell phone activity is present and it always is when you need it most!) is decent enough day or night, the unit itself cannot hook to anything, you cannot record your videos when odd occurences come up and I'm not there, I'd like it recorded the unit comes with an A/V out/ male to RCA female but it doesn't work in a TV the out jack, not the cord is at fault but it is totally useless except for monitoring current activity.
