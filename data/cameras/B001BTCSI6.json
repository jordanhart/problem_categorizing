{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A review of the Nikon D700 by a Nikon D300 owner", "Author": "LGO \"LG10\"", "ReviewID": "R2E7E6P2XVUSTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am making this review of the Nikon D700 from the perspective of someone who also owns a Nikon D300.Without qualification, the Nikon D300 is a superb camera.  So many superlatives have been used with the D300 that I will not repeat them here.  All the superlatives used with the D300 applies equally well to the D700.  I will add however that as good as the superlatives may have been with the D300, the D700 deserves a bit more.Let me explain.The Nikon D700 is equipped with a full frame FX sensor (36.00mm x 23.90mm).  This is the same sensor used by the Nikon D3. Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) The D300 on the other hand uses the APS-C sensor (23.60mm x 15.80mm).  Both the D700 and the D300 have about the same 12 megapixel rating (with the D300 actually slightly higher).The D700 having a bigger sensor than the D300 but with about the same megapixel rating means that the size/pixel density of the D700 is much lower than the D300.  The ratio is 1.4MP/cm2 vs 3.3MP/cm2 for the D700 and the D300 respectively.  A lower ratio means lower noise and this ratio favors the D700.  For the D700, this translates to lower noise in capturing the same image than when using using the D300.The D700 lower noise level in turn translates to the D700 being able to operate at a higher ISO level than the D300.  The D700 can operate as high as ISO 25,600 while the D300 can go up to ISO 6,400.  It is of course quite rare to shoot at such high ISO as it will always be better to shot at a lower ISO rating.  But if both the D700 and D300 were shooting at the same ISO, the D700 will have lower noise levels.  Simply put, the higher ISO capability of the D700 versus the D300 indicates the higher level of performance of the D700's sensor vs the D300.My actual use validates this theoretical advantage.  I noticed that while the noise level of the D300 is very good at ISO 1600 and even 3200, the D700 consistently showed lower noise level than the D300 shooting at the same ISO setting and light condition.  This is most noticeable when shooting at night with many bright lights in the periphery of the main subject.In terms of color rendition, I have not noticed any significant differences between the D300 and the D700 in the limited time that I have been using the D700.  It may be due to the fact that I have conducted my test at dusk and at night.When using the D700, the full frame sensor means that one will not need to convert the focal length of the lens by a factor of 1.5x.  So a 50mm lens will be a 50mm lens for the D700 rather than its 75mm equivalent when used with the D300.While this may appear to be a disadvantage on the telephoto side, its gain on the wide angle side is considerable and can only be described as an eye opener.  The D700 advantage in wide angle application does not just come from its wider perspective.  Rather, it is how the D700 maximizes and makes full use of such excellent lens as the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8 that makes buying the D700 such an eye opener.The resulting images taken with the Nikon D700 and the Nikon 14-24mm are clearer, sharper and crisper compared to the D300 even when the focal length in the D700 is zoomed out to its equivalent in the the D300 (21mm in D700 and 14mm in D300).  Vignetting is not noticeably worse even when the D700 is used with the 14-24mm glass fully open at its widest focal length (14mm, f/2.8).  This is surprising considering that the D700 is now using the full lens instead of just its sweet spot in the center (which would have been to the advantage of the D300 due to its APS-C sensor).It is not just the wide angle lens that benefited from the D700.  Even the slight vignetting I noticed with my 85mm f/1.4 shot with the D300 at f/2.8 is not considerably worse in the D700.  I am very surprised at this rather unexpected results as I had expected the opposite.  At any rate, vignetting is easily corrected in post-processing.Still, I should add that for corner to corner sharpness (such as in landscape photography), the D700 with its full-frame sensors will be more demanding on the lens than the D300 with its smaller APS-C sensor.As to the physical differences between the D700 and the D300, while these two models are roughly equal in size, the D700 is slightly heavier than the D300.  This is not an issue for me at all.What tilts the balance in favor of the D700 is its view finder which is significantly brighter and better than the D300.  This difference is very noticeable when switching from the D700 to the D300 and vice versa.This much improved viewfinder however is a mixed blessing.  One disadvantage that the D700 has over the D300 is that the D700 viewfinder captures only 95% of the image while the D300 viewfinder captures 100% of the image shot.  So the actual image captured is slightly bigger than what appears in the D700 viewfinder.  I understand that this resulted from fitting the bigger sensor from the D3 into the body size of a D300.  Given the better image quality of the D700 viewfinder and the better quality of its pictures, I am willing to work with this disadvantage and simply compensate for it during actual use.  But I hope that Nikon corrects this though in its next iteration of the D700.The D700 has an advantage over the D3 as it has an integrated flash which the D3 does not have.  The integrated flash is extremely useful when used with the other components of Nikon's Creative Lightning System.The Nikon MB-D10 Battery Pack Nikon MB-D10 Multi Power Battery Pack for Nikon D300 & D700 Digital SLR Cameras from the D300 fits the D700 perfectly well.  This is very convenient as I can opt for a smaller and lighter package when I do not need the MB-D10 for high-speed shooting.  This is one advantage that the D700 has over the D3 where the battery pack is integrated with the camera.  But a D700 with an MB-D10 is bigger and heavier than a D3.  And even when the D700 is equipped with an MB-D10, the D3 is still faster.  This makes the D3 a better unit for sports photography.Since I shoot mostly portrait, special events and landscape and seldom shoot sports, the D700 is perfect for my needs and I can do without the D3.  The D700 lower price tag means that I can get the D700 with at least one of Nikon's professional lens.Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom LensNikon 16-35mm f/4G ED VR II AF-S IF SWM Wide Angle Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom LensNikon AF-S NIKKOR 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II LensNikon 85mm f/1.4G AF-S Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLRNikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon 35mm f/1.4G AF-S FX SWM Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasNikon 24mm f/1.4G ED AF-S RF SWM Prime Wide-Angle Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasIdeally, the D700 should not be used with the DX lenses.  This said, it is possible to use the DX lenses with the D700.  The D700 makes the switch to DX lens automatically without need to fiddle with any control.  Because the DX lens covers only a section of the D700 sensor, the maximum resolution of using a DX lens on the D700 is only 5.1 megapixel.  This smaller coverage is automatically delineated by a box in the D700 viewfinder.  In addition to the lower resolution, the extreme two ends of a zoom lens is not usable.  Within these limitations, the D700 can use DX lens and produces very good pictures albeit on a smaller resolution / file size.The D700/FX (1.0x factor) and the D300/DX (1.5x factor) effectively doubles my lens option.  For those planning to own both the D300 and the D700, it would be wise to choose a glass that would be usable with both bodies.In closing, I consider the D700 a good complement to my D300.  Except for my Nikon 18-200mm DX lens (which I bought for my Nikon D200), all my glasses and accessories for the D300 can be used with the D700 at its full resolution.  I will use the D700 in those times when I need the best results shooting wide angle and/or at high ISO speed.  In those times when I need the extra reach, the D300's 1.5x crop factor makes the best use of my telephoto lenses.Edit: November 22, 2008I continue to use both the Nikon D300 and the Nikon D700 and often bring both together whenever I go out to shoot.  In those times when I just bring one camera body, I choose the D300 whenever range and higher pixel density is a major concern (bec. of the 1.5x crop factor effect on the field of view due to the smaller APS-C sensor but with resolution still at 12megapixel).  The D300 is an excellent camera and its 1.5x factor is very handy when I need to reach out with a 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom or with my 180mm f/2.8 prime without need of using a teleconverter.  For almost every other instance, including portrait, landscape and low light photography however, I find myself reaching out for the D700.After over 3 and a half months of use, I can safely say that the color depth of the D700 is significantly much better than the D300. The range of colors, the color details, the varying shade of colors, and the dynamic range  that the D700 is capable of capturing is considerably better and richer than what the D300 is capable of.  This advantage is best appreciated when taking portrait and landscape photos.  The difference in dynamic range is specially noticeable when shooting at higher ISO settings as noise imposes considerable limits on the dynamic range possible.  The D700 is clearly better than the D300 on dynamic range at high ISO settings.One other difference I should mention between the D300 and the D700 is the difference that the sensor size has on effective depth of field.  The bigger the sensor, the shallower the depth of field while the smaller the sensor, the greater the depth of field.  Point and shoot cameras with minuscule-sized sensor often have the greatest depth of field.The D700, having a bigger full-frame sensor, has a shallower depth of field than the D300 (which has the smaller APS-C sensor) at the same aperture setting given the same equivalent lens focal length.  The difference in the effective depth of field is about one stop.  At the same equivalent focal length, the equivalent depth of field of a D700 at f/2.0 would be a D300 at f/1.4.The shallower depth of field of the D700 would be an advantage to a user who would like to isolate a subject and blur the background.  The deeper depth of field of the D300 would be an advantage to a user who would like to keep several subjects at difference distances in focus.  I use the D700 where I need to isolate a subject, blur the background, and get the best bokeh.  This effect is most noticeable when shooting at wide open apertures from f/1.4 to f/2.8.  This, plus the color advantage of the D700, makes the D700 my preferred body for shooting portraits.Finally, one difference I notice between the D700 and the D300 is that the D700 has a better damped shutter release button.  I find that it is easier to release the shutter in the D700 than in the D300.  This makes a big difference when shooting at low shutter speeds.Update: 02-10-2012With the D800 finally available, I thought I'd share my analysis on the D700 vs the D800Factors that works 2 ways:  Higher resolution  = greater details  = but requires higher memory card capacity  = but requires higher storage capacity  = but requires more RAM and faster CPU and better graphics cardImprovements in the D800 over the D700 other than sensor resolution1.  100% Viewfinder2.  Better AF3.  Better metering4.  Better WB5.  HD Video6.  Improved dynamic range7.  Improved color8.  Superior live view functions9.  Bigger 3.2\" LCD screen9.  Improved ergonomics and now with more buttons10. Lighter in weight by 95 grams11. Higher capacity battery12. Extra SDHC slot and support13. USB 3.0Disadvantage of D800 vs D700 other than sensor resolution1. 5fps vs 8fps on FX using battery pack2. Higher resolution requires slightly higher shutter speed to shoot handheld to achieve the same corner/border acuity.3. Higher resolution requires the best lenses to get good results, specially at side & corners4. Higher resolution means lens diffraction occurs earlier at f/9 instead of f/13 with D700 (if more DOF needed)5. Optional MB-D12 battery pack for D800 is priced almost double the optional MB-D10 battery pack for D700The D800 is not a true D700-replacement in that it does not use the D4 sensor.  Except for a slower frame-rate however, the D800 outperforms the D700 in all respects.  I have placed an order for a D4 and also added an order for a D800E.  I will however still be keeping my D700.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Smaller D3", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R2EXPIMARZU40P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing camera.  I am not going to go over the specs because you can read about them on just about any camera web site.  What I am going to concentrate on is who should buy one and why.First off, I've read about many folks lamenting having bought the D300 and now feel like the need to \"upgrade\" to a D700.  These are two different cameras for two different purposes and as such don't compete against each other so much as complement each other.  The D300 doesn't have the low noise capability (The D700 can get clean images at ISO1600 vice ISO400 for the D300) nor does it have the wide angle capabilities of the D700.  The D700 doesn't have the 1.5x multiplier of the D300 so wide angle lenses are truly wide.  Additionally, while you can use DX lenses on the D700, you will only be using 5 mp of your sensor.Another comparison is between the D3 and D700.  They both have the same sensor so the image and ISO abilities are the same.  The D700 comes slower out of the box but with the Nikon EN-EL4a Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for MB-D10 Battery Pack and Nikon D2 and D3 Digital SLR Cameras,  Nikon MB-D10 Multi Power Battery Pack for Nikon D300 & D700 Digital SLR Cameras,  Nikon BL-3 Battery Chamber Cover for Nikon EN-EL4 and EN-EL4a for the MB-D10, and Nikon MH-21 Quick Charger for Nikon EN-EL4 and EN-EL4a Rechargeable Li-Ion Batteries (~$500) you will be rocking with 8 fps and great battery life; just barely slower than the D3.  Also, I have not found any technical data on the autofocus and processing chip but in my non-scientific side by side comparison the D700 seemed just as fast as the D3 while the D300 appeared noticeably slower.  (This was shot with the 85mm 1.4D.  This lens does not have Silent Wave Motor focus and therefore relies on the camera's focusing motor.)  As I said this is not scientific but I am also guessing that Nikon saved on engineering costs by just transferring the guts of the D3 to the D700 and slowing it down (this is probably the reason the D700 gets such poor battery life (200-300 shots vice 1000 shots) in comparison to the D300).So without further ado:Buy the Nikon D700 12.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) if:You need to shoot in no flash low light situations.  With a 1.4 lens at 1600 ISO you would be amazed at the quality of the photos!  If you are not doing close up work of people you can get great shots @ 6400 ISO.  If you can stand a grain in B+W(a very cool effect by the way), then you can get good shots @ 25,600!You want to shoot ultra wide.  With no multiplication factor, you can shoot truly wide angle photos.  The 14mm is 14mm not 21mm like on a DX camera.  Also, although you can get the Nikon 12-24mm f/4G ED IF Autofocus DX Nikkor Zoom Lens which will be the equivalent of 18-36mm, it will still have the distortion of a 12-24mm lens.  So compared to the FX D700 you would get 14 deg less width with more distortion.You are willing to spend $4500 more on the lenses.  The body is disposable, the lenses are what last.  You could get away with a 50mm 1.4 and that would be a fine place to start and a great way to learn how to frame a picture.  However, I would recommend the following 3 lenses and I would recommend getting them in the following order.  1)  The Nikon 85mm f/1.4D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras -  $1000 (Super fast, incredibly shallow depth of field, and amazing construction.  Get this lens and practice getting good with a fixed length lens!  Get this lens over the 85mm 1.8 for the construction and 9 blade design.  You will be blown away with how low the light can be and you can still get the shot!  (Rumors have it that Nikon is about to replace this lens with a new improved version.  I expect the new lens will be better but will likely cost 1.5 to 2x as much.)  2)  The Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras - $1700 This is the lens pros use to earn their living.  (It has been 5 years since Nikon updated this lens so it is due for a replacement soon but again I am sure it will be more expensive and this lens rocks right now)  3.  The Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens - ~$1600.  Stupid fast, stupid wide, and stupid great.  What more can you ask?Buy the Nikon D300 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens if:You want an amazing all around lens.  The Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens (27-300mm equivalent)  You really never need to take this lens off.  You can shoot wide (27mm) and telephoto (300mm)  Wow this lens does it all.You want to shoot long.  If you take a D300, the 70-200mm 2.8, and a 1.7x teleconverter you get a 178-510mm F4.8 for $3600!!  Or add the 300mm 2.8 and you get a 765mm F4.8 for $6500 ($3000 cheaper and 5 lbs lighter than a 600mm F4 lens).  Totally astounding.You shoot in relatively decent light.  Until I got the D700, I routinely shot great portrait shots at home, at night, and with poor lighting using the D300 and the 85mm 1.4 at 1/30s and ISO200-400.You want to buy and take advantage of DX lenses.  Really you only need 2 lenses with the D300.  You will want the 18-200mm and the 12-24mm.  That will cover everything you need for a grand total of $1500.  I would still recommend the Nikon 85mm f/1.4D AF Nikkor Lens.  A stupid fast 128mm 1.4 on the D300.Buy the Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) if everything about the D700 fits your shooting requirements and:You shoot more than 3000 photos per month.  The D700's shutter is rated to 150,000 cycles while the D3 is 300,000.  Nikon's generational replacement cycle for their flagship camera is 4 years.  That means if you shoot ~3000 photos per month you will shoot ~150,000 shots in 4 years and it will be time to replace the camera anyway.  If you shoot 10,000 shots per month you will have to replace the camera in 15 months.  However, with the D3 you would not have to replace the camera until 30 months.You earn your living shooting photographs.  Memory cards rarely fail but do you want to lose thousands of dollars and your reputation by risking it.  Get the D3 and set it to write the images to both cards.  Yes, there are other techniques to minimize your exposure to this failure but none are as easy and reliable.You don't want the option to remove the battery and vertical grip.  With the D700 you can add the MB-D10 to make it 98% of the D3.  However, if you don't want the weight or need the speed you can remove it and save the space and weight.  This is useful for long hiking trips (However, I would recommend a D300 for this unless you were hand shooting in low light).", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "The one I'd been waiting for", "Author": "Carl E. Feather \"cfeather\"", "ReviewID": "RXQGW7Q174OEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a semi-pro digital user for five years. I started wtih a Fuji S2, moved up to the Nikon D2H (horrible reliability, expensive), D2Hs, D200, D300 and finally the D700.With every camera prior to the D700 there were compromises and Nikon was always two years behind Canon. Finally, when the D3 came out, they were in the lead again, but the price was too much for my semi-pro use to justify. So I struggled along with a pair of D300s for another eight months. The D300 is an excellent camera, however, it has some serious flaws: It overexposes and is particularly hot on the red channel. It's higher ISO performance is mediocre and really kills detail. And it's DX.I bought a D700 for $2950 and, predictably, the price fell $200 a few days after that. But I needed it for an assignment that would involve shooting in a dimly light garage.The camera worked perfectly, although once again, I am seeing overexposure in some scenes. The auto WB is much improved over the D300. The dynamic range is much improved, as well. And the AF seems faster.This camera has me going back to prime lenses. The DOF is much shallower and the bokeh much nicer with my 85mm and 50mm lenses on the D700. Eventually, I want to be all primes on the long end. My 300 f/4 gives wonderful results on this body. The 70-200 is a mixed bag. I'm just not happy with the look of the images. They are not as sharp as they are on the D300 (I kept one). Weird. I'm still testing.I love everthing about the D700 except it's tendency to overexpose and the fact Canon's competitor has video and more MP. Video really should have been on this camera; after all, the D90 at 1/3 the price has it. Nikon dropped the ball by not including it on the D700. Two months after being introduced, the D700 is already a somewhat obsolete camera, thanks to Canon's offering of more mp and video.All that said, as a Nikon user I'm glad to finally have 5D image quality in a full-frame Nikon, even though it comes at a premium. I feel the current combo of the D300/D700 will last me for several years, and will eventually result in a transition to almost all prime lenses, if Nikon ever gets its act together and offers some worthy wide angle primes to match with this body. Meantime I find the 35 f/2, 50 f/1.4, 85 f/1.4, 105 micro, 180 f/2.8 and 300 f/4 to be excellent matches for this body. The Beast 28-70 f/2.8 is also a good performer on this body, as is the 14-24 f/2.8. The 70-200 f/2.8 is questionable.Be sure to get the grip for best balance and extended battery life. I find the D700 has better battery performance than the D300. Also if you do portraits, get a portrait Expo Disc and download the portrait custom setting for your camera. The results are very nice.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "A dream come true for long-time film users!", "Author": "J. Gwen Ingram", "ReviewID": "R3U8NB4MI7TQUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D700 is exactly the digital SLR that I envisioned when I first heard that such an animal existed.  After over a quarter-century of shooting film and gradually realizing the advantages digital holds for me through using a high-end point-and-shoot as an adjunct to my faithful old Nikon SLR film camera, I eagerly bought a D70s ... and was exceedingly frustrated and disappointed.  My familiar old lenses responded differently (the 1.5 \"multiplier effect\") ... when they responded at all (a \"non-CPU\" lens could be mounted, but all camera exposure and metering functions were disabled, making the result disadvantageous even compared to a pre-AF film body and lens).Not any more!  Even though the D700 was primarily intended to be used with auto-focusing (AF) lenses, it also functions superbly with my non-CPU (manual focus) lenses, only losing the \"shutter priority\" and \"program\" modes (because, of course, the camera can't alter the aperture ... that's my job on any non-CPU lens) ... the D700 can even give me focusing feedback after I enter a manual lens's information into the D700's menu.  I once more feel like I have good, quick control over the aspects of photography that create the character of my photographs.  No more fumbling with lots of fingers over several sets of buttons to tell the camera the simplest things ... it's back to rotating the focus and aperture rings (or not, if I choose the AF lenses).And the annoying \"multiplier effect\" is gone with the D700's full-frame (\"FX\") sensor.  My 50mm lens -- my mainstay -- is now a true 50mm lens again (if you have to ask why that matters, the D700 isn't for you).  I personally don't pursue wide-angle photography, but I definitely can see how those who do (and who haven't been able to afford a D3) will be doing cartwheels if they can get their hands on a D700.The D700's viewfinder is also light years above my D70s, making everything from focusing to composition that much easier and more precise.  The D700's whopping big LCD screen is also a big advantage.  When in review mode, the display is large ... or, at my choice, the increased data option shrinks the thumbnail to a still-valuable size and places the data around the photo instead of over it like the D70s does.I'm finding the grip very comfortable, and although the weight is hefty compared to any point-and-shoot, it is a well-balanced camera and that weight doesn't bother me.  Being able to shoot in RAW mode is resulting in not only better end-result photos for me, but also (once I get the RAW files on my computer) much more accurate feedback on what I can improve about my technical choices ... and one of digital photography's most significant advantages is that faster feedback.  Also of note for those who like working in RAW, unlike the D70, I now have the option to shoot ONLY in RAW mode, not just RAW + JPEG, and that saves valuable memory space.My only negative comment so far is that Nikon's proprietary software (included with the D700) is necessary to download photos to one's computer.  I'll adapt, but it just seems an unnecessary restriction.Even though it's priced well under the other full frame Nikon, the D3, the D700 certainly does not come cheap.  For me, it was the only affordable solution, and well worth every penny.  If you spent years shooting film and count a bundle of old Nikon lenses among your close friends, the D700 is going to make you wonder if you'll ever stop grinning!  ***Update, November 21, 2008:  I've had the D700 for three months now. Three months isn't a long time to evaluate durability, and I'm certainly not one of those people who shoots 1000 or more captures a week (I still have frugal film habits), but early use is one of the common timeframes for quality problems to surface. I'm certainly pleased that I've experienced no problems with the camera's function.The D700 continues to exceed my expectations as a camera and as a true successor to my film camera.  It has put the fun back into photography for me -- once set up to my preferences, the D700 stays out of my way and lets me photograph the way I have for decades, with the pleasing results I'm used to getting ... and with all the advantages of digital capture.  Despite my miserly film-born habits, I've happily made enough digital images to account for almost half the camera body's purchase price if those captures were translated to film and developing.Now that I've established a workflow (Nikon Transfer to Adobe Bridge CS3 to Photoshop CS3), having to use Nikon Transfer for downloading images is a non-issue at home.  On the road, though, I'll have to wait until returning to my own computer (with the Nikon Transfer software) to see my pics, so this is still a definite limitation.What has totally blown my mind is the D700's performance in low light.  I never expected high ISO captures to be so useable, let alone what I've gotten at ISO 6400.  I'm shooting in the house with ambient lighting and no flash and actually getting a high percentage of \"keepers\"!  No longer do I shrug and say \"too bad, not enough light\" nor does a flash disturb my subject and alter or destroy the mood.  I've also found I can capture good images at indoor events and competitions (such as llama and horse shows) without flash, making my presence a non-issue instead of a potential disruption.  As a result, the D700 has given me a brand new opportunity to capture a significant segment of my world in pixels.No, ISO 6400 image quality is not equivalent to ISO 200, nor is it often really suitable for 100% size printing or display (11.8\"x17.7\").  But for smaller prints and display (in the 25-50% range), it's remarkable, and certainly superior to anything I could possibly have captured with any other DSLR (besides the D3, which has the same sensor), let alone on film (because I primarily shoot nature outdoors, I never could justify loading any film higher than ISO 400 in my Nikon FE).  I have never in my life had anything printed larger than 8x12 with one exception, and usually I've not even printed that large, so the limitations on the D700's ISO 6400 are minimal for me (and what it can do is still not achievable otherwise).  To see some actual samples, you're welcome to go to my Flickr photostream ([...]) and search for photos tagged with Nikon D700 and ISO 6400, or just search for Nikon D700 and look at the EXIF data for the resulting photos if you prefer.  Unless the photo is also tagged with \"noise ninja\", it has NO noise reduction (I'm from film, remember -- minimal digital post-processing skills at this time!.  If you have and use noise-reduction software, you already know what further improvements can be made in the dark areas of the captures.I do have one new quibble with the D700 -- I wish Nikon had not limited the non-CPU lens menu to only ten lenses.  Because I'm coming from years of comfort with shooting manual focus lenses on film, that's what I do on the D700 ... and as a result, I've got all ten slots full!  If I want to use a teleconverter (or if I acquire any other manual focus lenses), I have to re-program one or more of the slots.  Hopefully Nikon will provide a firmware update to address this, although I'm not holding my breath either.  Certainly a huge percentage of people love their autofocus lenses; the demand and financial return to NIkon for such an update probably isn't significant from a marketing standpoint.I'm also finding that it would have been more logical for the Auto-ISO setting to be available through the dedicated ISO button instead of in the shooting menu.  Again, a possible firmware update could address this ... if Nikon feels it's warranted.  It's not impossible to work around, just less convenient than it could be.  I'm not sure if other currently available DSLRs share this arrangement or not.Initially I would have said that those people who started photography with DX format (or who converted to digital years ago) would not see any major benefit in the D700.  Now I'm not so sure.Certainly anyone who has only DX lenses would be financially impacted by also needing to purchase good full-frame lenses to actually benefit from the D700's full-frame capabilities; anyone whose preferences include telephoto and wildlife photography will also be disadvantaged by losing the \"reach\" that the 1.5x DX multiplier provides if they sell their current Nikon DSLR to finance a D700.  (You can use DX lenses on the D700, but they use a smaller portion of the sensor, resulting in a lower MP image ... hardly a reasonable use of a $2.5K+ camera.)However, for low ambient light photography, the D700 has no equal (other than the significantly more expensive D3).  Before experiencing what the D700 can do, I said, \"Well, I don't really use high ISO, so I don't need that capability.\"  Now that I have the capability, I'm really using it, and I wouldn't give it up for anything.Fortunately, even if the choice is not entirely clear-cut, the choices ARE there.

I'm a believer that the photographer is far more important than the camera, and I can pretty much get great results from any camera.  But this camera simply stands out from the pack.  It is nearly perfect.  And I say that as someone who usually gets professional cameras.If you want to know about the camera, read the review on [...].  No sense in me adding more.After living with this camera for 9 months, I have lost all desire for any other camera.  I'm a gear-head and love to get my hands on new equipment.  I love getting new cameras and always figure out what I would improve on it.  But this camera just does everything and I (this amazes me) just don't care what else they come out with.  The feel, the controls, the image quality and overall performance is simply amazing.  It is nearly  perfect - so what are the \"flaws\"?Well, I wish I could lock the shooting banks.  The camera lets you set it up and store your settings in a \"bank\".  This lets you rapidly change to a particlar bank to load your settings.  You might have one bank set for sports, another for night time shooting, another for multi-flash lighting, etc.  The flaw?  Any change you make changes the bank.  So your bank changes as you change the camera. That nearly wrecks shooting banks for me.  The workaround is to set your banks, then save them to a CF card (I use that old 1GB card I had laying around).  Before a shoot, I pop the card in and reload all the settings.  I just with I could lock the banks and not have to carry that card around.And you can't combine the mirror-up mode with the self timer.  You either have to use a remote release (another thing to carry) or let it time out (it fires after 30 seconds with the mirror up).That's pretty much it.  Well, it is not cheap, but considering you get the same performance as the Nikon D3 for half the price, this is an amazing deal.Is 12 megapixels enough?  Well, I have a 44\" printer and print 24\" x 36\" all the time from Photoshop CS4.  Yes, 12MP is fine for me.  If you print larger than that, then more pixels would be nice.  Of course, one of the advantages of this camera is with only 12MP, each pixel (sensel) is huge and captures a lot of light.  I shoot at night without a flash all the time.  This camera is simply capable of doing things that were never really possible before.Just remember - the camera is an accessory to the lens system.  I have a lot of Nikon pro lenses and this camera gets the most out of that glass.  If you are thinking about getting cheap glass for this camera, you may wish to reconsider.  I'd rather have a pro lens and a low-end camera than a pro camera with cheap glass.  Glass lasts for a long time and this camera can use nearly every Nikon lens made since the middle 1960's.  Invest in your lenses, because they tend to go up in price, while the cameras get cheaper and better.If you want a suggestion, consider this camera with the Nikkor 85mm f/1.4 AF-D.

Of course, as part of my transition and as a way to cope with the learning curve, I decided to look at this camera as if it were some type of cross between the Nikon F100 and the F5.  It does have the heft of the latter, and the ease of use of the former.  The complexity of the menus was intimidating at first, but a couple of evenings with the manual, camera in hand, took care of most of my questions.  Now, I simply take photographs with my film lenses and the behemoth I purchased to accompany this camera: the AF-S 24-70 f2.8.Even for a newbie in the digital world, this camera is fairly uncomplicated; since the layout resembles so much that of the F100, the photographic part of the workflow was a joy.  However, things get complicated in the digital end: 1.  Do I have to shoot RAW, JPEGs, both?  2. What to do with RAW files?  3. How to download them to the computer?  4. Which type of cards works well with the camera?  5. Do I need Nikon software absolutely?Answers found:1. Not necessarily; the best compromise is to shoot RAW and JPEGs at the same time, but it may create storage crisis.2. One can treat RAW files as digital negatives and that helps in case one screws up a JPEG.3  Either from the camera or with a card reader, the choice is personal.  I've done both, and found I like the card reader better because it won't use camera juice.4.  Best: Sandisk Extreme III or Lexar Pro, with a transfer speed of at least 80 MB/sec.5.  No, unless one wants to replicate some of the in-camera editing.And this brings me to something else: the D-Lighting magic wand!  I simply love this feature, but I don't use it while shooting, as it creates an unnecessary amount of noise.  However, together with the color rendition, I like D-Lighting a lot.  I dislike the fact that not all AF sensors were created equal (some in the periphery are not cross-sensitive), but then, it's relatively easy to work around this problem.  In short, for those going digital from an extensive film background, it's an excellent camera body, and it will remain unparallelled for a long time.  Who needs more megapixels when the camera is so well-crafted?Did I mention that it fell on the floor on my third day of ownership?  Granted, it fell of a chair because I pulled the strap with my foot.  Nothing happened.  Also, I took it on a walk in the frigid winter of IL, and the camera worked as well as any of my other weather-resistant Nikon bodies.One recommendation: do not use the Nikon strap.  It hurts!  From experience carrying heavy cameras, get a slightly elastic strap, as the camera can be very heavy, esp. when combined with the 24-70 or the 80-200.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Dilemma of Choosing D600, D700, or D800", "Author": "Plantasphilia", "ReviewID": "R1JS12KXK8G5AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching the internet and visiting camera stores for hands-on experience, I chose D700 without regret. There are many people out there trying to make the decision of the 3 wonderful cameras. I can only share my analysis based on my need and experience, as an avid amateur photographer.D600: the solid pro-sumer body feels the same as D7000, which I also own. Nikon transplanted the FX heart into a DX body. It is very natural for D7000 owners to upgrade to D600 for the ease of use on functions and layouts. However, I dislike the AF system concentrating mainly in the center, which can be challenging when trying to focus under certain situations. In addition, the problem of the occasional oil spell/dust on the sensor issue can be an indication of quality control problem of this model. I have tried to clean camera sensors before; it is far from easy to do so, wet or dry method. Therefore, most professionals dissuade the general public to do so and recommend leaving the job to the authorized dealers. Believe me, it is beyond annoying when you see spots on your pictures; and sometimes the spots appear in the place that can be very hard to correct.D800: nice pro heavy body with a huge 36mp sensor. Upgrading from a DX, I can not justify spending (jumping) thus much on such a powerful camera. Instead, as most professional photographers suggest, I will spend more on quality lenses, which usually out-last the cameras. If you own D800, you'd better have pro lenses. Otherwise, all the \"defects\" will show up in pictures with its huge and powerful sensor. In addition, D800 also has its own quality control issues, which is back focusing. Also, as an amateur, I tend to shoot more pictures than the pros, making sure I get the pictures I want. Therefore, I end up with a good number of pictures after an assignment and it takes time to process them. I am not ready to store (space-wise) and process (time-wise) big files from the D800 yet... maybe much later.D700: I picked this \"old\" camera over the two new models. It is a pro body, weather sealed, similar weight to D800. The layout is not too different from D7000 (thank goodness!) and easy to get used to. Since it is discontinued, the price dropped to the level that it is quite affordable, especially used ones, though be careful with the \"used\" condition, as it varies A LOT! This is the trial-and-true cameras, a work horse for many professionals. Despite having an older sensor, D700 still can produce exceptional images with wonderful sharpness and color rendition. Pairing it with the right lenses, you get \"gallery\" quality photos/prints. I don't worry too much of the \"small\" 12 mp sensor. As an amateur, most of us don't print over 2'x3' anyway. Its renowned focus system is outstanding, right on everything every time I shoot!I care about the image quality (what my eyes can see), body built (how my hands feel), and the focus system (the first and foremost ingredient in sharp image). I believe all these 3 cameras are capable of producing excellent pictures. Currently, the D700 fits my need, my budget, and the overall quality I am looking for. After all, all the equipments are \"tools\" at best. It is the photographer that takes good or bad pictures. A soft but well-composed picture is not as bad as a sharp yet meaningless one.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just awesome!", "Author": "Dude From MI \"New Dad\"", "ReviewID": "R1F7E4BQ88HX7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was trying to decide between purchasing the D700 and the Canon 5D MkII.  I liked the prospect of the significantly lower prices of the Canon lenses and slightly higher MP count of the 5D.  But those differences don't necessarily lead to better pics.  Well, I went with the Nikon and am simply amazed.  I purchased the Nikon 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6G ED IF Autofocus VR Nikkor Zoom Lens, the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens, the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G SIC SW Prime Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, the Nikon 105mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor Lens, the Nikon SB-900 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, and a pair of Lexar Professional Series UDMA 16 GB 300x CompactFlash Memory Card CF16GB-300-381 to go along with a couple of lenses I already had from a previous Nikon N8008.

This is not to mention the incredible daylight photos it produces.  The menus are very easy to navigate and setup your custom settings for different subject and lighting conditions.  I was very tired of the poor results from the point-and-shoot cameras so I decided to take the plunge into real photography again.  I've found a new hobby!  One item that never ceases to amaze me is the auto focus ability of the D700.  It just ALWAYS gets the subject in focus.  I can't explain it any different than that.

It inherits many great features from Nikon pro-DSLR camera Nikon D3 and add some other useful features such as dust reduction and wireless flash commander.What is special about Nikon D700?Like its big brother Nikon D3, D700 has incredible clean image at high ISO setting, 51 AF points with several tracking modes include 3D tracking. It shoots 5 fps but can be boost to 8 fps with battery grip attached. Unlike D3, it has compact size but it is not light. It is 995 g.Body and HandlingNikon D700's body is similar to Nikon D300 (a crop sensor DSLR camera or DX) in many ways. But of course it has a little bit different here and there. For example. D700 is taller and wider to accommodate larger viewfinder.D700 body feels very solid and made by magnesium alloy body. It has textured rubber in the grip area. As discussed above, the camera is quite heavy, but it helps to balance the camera especially if you mount it with heavy pro grade lenses.Although regarded as pro camera, D700 body is not as tough and reliable as top of the line pro camera and some advanced crop sensor camera. There are some irritations for example the rubber side door open up occasionally and the built-in flash also opens up because the flash button is quite sensitive to touch.Nevertheless, the control and handling are great, just like Nikon D300. Nikon has different philosophy than other cameras such as Canon. Instead pressing button, dial and pressing button again, Nikon requires you to press and hold the button and then dial. It is so to avoid accidental change of setting. There is no more mode dial, but there are so many dedicated buttons for all important camera settings such as ISO, WB, Mode, Metering, Auto focus mode, and many more.D700 also has top LCD screen like some advanced Nikon cameras (D90, D300), but it is a bit smaller to make room for the viewfinder and flash. So there is no AF points position in the top LCD. But most of the crucial information are there.The other great thing about the camera is you can program function button and depth of field preview button to other function that you like, it could be activating live view, or set the focus point to center, etc. There wide customization available to suit your shooting style and preferences.Although this camera has only 95% viewfinder coverage (Both D3 and D300 has 100% coverage), the size of the viewfinder are very big and it will amazed most of people that use crop sensor camera without fail.Image Quality and Auto ISOImage quality in high ISO is the best in the world (along with Nikon D3). Images are very clean up to ISO 4000. Image at ISO 6400 is very usable and great in print up to 8' X 11'.  The great image quality in high ISO is due to Nikon full frame sensor which has only 12 megapixel and software that control the chroma/color noise out of the image. The noise in Nikon looks more natural compared to camera of other brand.For pixel peepers (people who likes to zoom in 100% in digital images), you will be very satisfied. D700 is very sharp (depends on the lens too) up to pixel level.One of my favorite feature of D700 and also Nikon D90 is the Auto ISO limiter. You can effectively limit the ISO and minimum shutter speed. The Auto ISO works very well and accurate most of the time. My favorite way to use this is to set the camera to Auto ISO, and then use Aperture mode and let the camera adjust the rest for me.LCD ScreenIt is 3' LCD Screen with 920k res which is standard for mid range camera in the late 2008 and 2009 camera. It is very detailed and relatively good in bright light condition.MenuLike other Nikon cameras, I feel Nikon menu is pretty confusing because they throw all over items regardless if the item is popular item or not. Therefore, it might take you some time to find some of your favorite menu items. To be fair, Nikon has my menu tab, where you can choose and put the menu item in this tab. Overall, I feel menu could be improved. Canon cameras menu for example, is easier, more logical and simple to navigate.Auto Focus system & Continuous shooting speedNikon D700 has 51 AF points. It is the same as Nikon D3 or D300. It has several dynamic tracking modes include 3D tracking which is very fast and accurate. The AF speed varies depend on what kind of Nikon lens you use. Old Nikon lenses usually slower in AF, same as customer grade AF-S lens like 35mm AF-S f/1.8G lens.D700 has continuous shooting speed are good (5 fps), but when you attached the battery grip, it becomes 8 fps, which is great for sports or wildlife. It cost several hundred more for the grip, but it worth it, because not only you get more frames per second, but it is easier to shoot in portrait mode. The drawback is the entire package becomes bulky and heavy.Lens compatibilityInvesting in FX / full frame Nikon cameras means that you are ready to spend money, not only for the camera, but you need to spare some money to get the lenses as well. As a FX camera, D700 does not compatible with many consumer grade lenses which has \"DX\" letters attached in the lens name. You can still use DX lenses, but your image will be cropped and you will get only 5 megapixel image. Nikon has several primes that work very well with D700 such as Nikon 50mm f/1.4G, Nikon 35mm f/2D and Nikon 85mm f/1.4D. For zoom lenses, there are Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8, Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 and Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8 VR.Most of the lenses above are expensive, but there are some affordable solutions (third party lenses) that cost a lot less, but they are really good for Nikon D700.Creative Lighting SystemUnlike D3 which has no built-in flash, D700 has built in flash. It is due for a reason, to fit in wireless commander features or also called Creative Lighting System (CLS). This system is not perfect because it won't work in certain position and situation, for example in bright daylight, in a great distance, or if the line of sight to the flashes are blocked. However CLS is fun to use and save you money. Nikon D90 also has built-in AF motor so it is compatible with older Nikon AF-D lenses which we often found in fixed focal length lenses / primes.CompetitorsNikon D700 has three major competitors in compact full frame DSLR class and some competition from crop sensor DSLR class.In the full frame category, Nikon D700 competes with Canon 5D mark II and Sony A900. 5D mark II has video mode, and 21 MP, but the image is not as clean as D700 in low light, Also, 5D mark II has old auto focus system which is slower and it also have slower 3.9 fps continuous shooting.Sony A900 has double the resolution of D700, 100% coverage viewfinder and 5 fps continuous shooting. A900 does not have sophisticated AF system and live view.Photographers that consider to get D700 should also consider Nikon D300/D300s and Canon EOS 7D. They are not only cheaper but have most of the features D700 has. The other benefit of crops sensor camera is the crop factor of 1.5 (Nikon cameras) / 1.6 (Canon cameras) so you get more reach for sports or wildlife. The drawback of crop sensor camera is it won't be have great image quality in high ISO.ConclusionNikon D700 is an very versatile camera for any kind of assignments. It is great for portrait, wedding, sports, photo journalistic assignments. It is great in bright or extremely low light. I will say it is all-around camera. The image quality is fantastic. However, I will not recommend it for travel because it is an heavy camera, and I don't recommend it to use in extreme environment condition because the built quality and seal is not as good as Nikon D3 or Canon 1D series. For outdoor field sports such as football or soccer, you might miss crop sensor DSLR camera because it has extra reach. Overall this is great camera, with a great price of this class.Subjective Rating - Relative to competitors  * Image Quality: 5/5  * Features: 4/5  * Performance: 5/5  * Body and Handling: 4/5  * Value for money: 4/5Check out my website for sample images and more reviews", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "close to perfect", "Author": "Minyan Zhu \"Jinx\"", "ReviewID": "RY18K7UOIZGRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera's got soul, and so much personalization options that you could spend all day configuring all the buttons and dials to your exact liking.

Plus, it's eliminated every excuse that I have for not producing world class photos, so I can no longer use that as a crutch. I think I'll be keeping mine close to me at all times.

Maybe this expansive reaction does not describe exactly the differences in image quality nor does say much about handling and ergonomics, however it says that I was QUITE surprised coming after almost one year of using an already wonderful dSLR that I enjoyed a lot.What I will try to do is to put down some differences between these two cameras and pinpoint some considerations you might be interested in if you want to jump full-frame. Keep in mind that although astonished by differences in image quality, I haven't taken this step yet and the reasons will be explained a little bit later.The Image - noise, color, accuracy and some moreWhen talking about Nikon full-frame cameras (D3/x and D700 - for the moment...) what probably comes first to one's mind is high ISO low noise capability. The improvement in this area is so dramatic that this alone might be a reason to go FX. Endless debates about EV differences in noise levels may continue for ages and, probably, no definitive objective answer will be written down. The point is that shooting at ISO 6400 is a must if you want to truly understand what high ISO low noise really means. True, a relatively lower resolution, 12mp sensor helps achieving such results, but the key here is not only the noise is less obvious or less chroma or... whatever, is the fact that, combined with the dramatic dynamic rendition in image of this camera, D700 allows you to do things that were not possible with D300 (or other DX camera) without a drastic reduction in detail and smudging shadows with impossible noise. For example - and that is the best argument I can raise - I am a big fan of underexposure as creative tool in photography. With the D300 I had to pay attention of exposing correctly at high ISO - maybe to overexpose a bit - then to bring down exposure in Capture NX2 if I wanted to achieve a 1/ creatively underexposed image with 2/ inapparent noise in shadows and 3/ preserved details, all these at ISO higher than 1000. To my surprise, D700 is much more forgiving with drastic (>1EV) underexposure in what relates to noise levels and lack of suppression of details. The image is clearer and more detailed that a corresponding DX one, underexposed with the same amount. The direct consequence of this is less time in post-processing (which I am not a very big fan of) and more keepers for your portfolio. Oh, and by the way, talking about Capture NX2, don't believe all those that complain about it. At least on my 4GB 2.4 iMac works flawlessly and, up to this moment, is the best RAW convertor for NEFs in my opinion.Back to noise, you might be interested to find out that ISO 6400 is a new, virgin territory to be explored with the D700 and this opens you the world of almost noise-free still photography at candlelight (exposure at 1ft/ 30cm from a small candle is 1/60 sec at F/1.4 at ISO 6400). Of course, you can push the limits and go further if you have a less expensive lens (mark that I avoided the term \"non-pro lens\") using a good de-noising software in post-processing. Coming to that, I tried Noise Ninja, Imagenomics Noiseware and some other software but, whenever I need to artificially remove noise, I always get back to Nik Software Dfine 2.0 which is a superb plugin for Photoshop. In my opinion, it does the best compromise in noise removal vs. detail preservation. Get the trial version and make some tests, you will understand my point.One more thing about high ISO: usually performance at these levels come at a price: sacrifice in detail rendition and errors in color accuracy. If the first was covered some lines above, I just want to say some words about color at high ISO.Contrary to some beliefs, color accuracy depends not only on the gear but most important to the quality of light. One has to work with a balanced spectrum to achieve good color rendition and maybe this is the reason that difficult colors (e.g. skin color, colors in shaded areas etc) should have high quality light sources to be put in their real value in a photograph.Strangely enough, the best artificial light source that comes immediately after the natural sun (with a bit of energy \"taming\"), is the cheap incandescent lightbulb (see color spectra vs energy for incandescent bulbs, lowell lamps and xenon lamps compared to CFL and laboratory reference lamps). Thus, even at low light energy, D700 behaves wonderful and on PRE white balance setting color accuracy is excellent and quite identical over the entire range of ISOs up to 6400. This is even better under natural light, color gamut is well preserved with a slight reduction in shades of deep red and blues (sky gradients may become slightly masked at high ISO levels. Overall, colors are exquisite and beautiful and extremely natural as long as you shoot under balanced light or, at least, under balanced gradients of light. Keep in mind that the worst white balance scenario is, always, auto white balance and fluorescent which, due to the inherent limitations of color distribution within fluorescent spectra, photos tend to have unpleasant hues.What is different, too, from D300 is the noise absence at low ISO levels, maybe more important than the same behavior at high ISO.Optics and cost of transitionThe conclusions of the discussion above will provide you a huge latitude of creativity. You will not feel \"limited\" anymore even using lower quality optics. However, if you own a lineup of consumer-grade optics, some deteriorations in the outcome will be evident. The problem is that with a higher pixel pitch and full frame, all, but ABSOLUTELY all flaws of your lenses will show up in capitals. D700 comes with a kit lens that serves better as body cap than optics on such a camera. Get rid of that AF-S VR Zoom-Nikkor 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF QUICKLY, otherwise you might feel the urge to send your D700 to Nikon for a checkout. Not even the Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras will be spared, some vignetting will be obvious under certain shooting conditions (clear sky that covers half of image, large areas of light and uniform color etc). The latest additions from Nikon optics, the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens and the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens are both good match for this camera and also some of the older lenses, especially the Nikon 85mm f/1.4D AF , the 35mm f/2 AIS and the 105 AIS versions of the lenses (which render a creamy, \"de-focus\"-like of images). Unfortunately, the rest of the pro grade lenses from Nikon are out of reach of the majority of us, but one can try and feel impressed by the older 80-200 or a fixed 300 f/4 that are to some match of this superb but unforgiving camera.This may create a budget problem and it is the main reason I haven't upgraded to a D700 yet (although my fingers burn...). If you just make a quick cash flow analysis, the investment for getting a FF \"pro-grade\" image with a D700 will hang heavy on your income, and includes the body and, MANDATORY, a pro-grade lens. And I will strongly suggest to go for the 24-70 f/2.8 nano coating AF-S something, which is the best walkaround zoom you might get for this camera. I have sold my 17-55 (a superb lens, but DX) and got the 24-70 just to be prepared for the next year upgrade to the FX format and decrease the financial shock one might feel with such a heavy investment in both a body and a pro lens.Another optical issue is that going only FX with the D700 means that you have to say goodbye to any Sigma 10-20mm, or Nikon 12-24mm, or Tokina AT-XAF124DXN 12-24mm  or whatever cropped format wide (or extrawide) zoom unless you want to cripple resolution to 5 mp and work in the DX mode (selectable in the D700 settings menus). The only option for FF is the new 14-24 f/2.8 Nikkor. Folks, this lens is incredible. It performs so well that even Canonites are prospecting getting them with adaptors on their pro bodies. But- and I hate to say that - it has some MAJOR functionality flaws that are extremely non pragmatic: different from - for example - the 16-35 Canon L, the 14-24 cannot take filters on the front. Bye bye polarizing filters and protection of the bulky rounded glass that protrudes like a fisheye. And going wide and pro, now, will cost you almost another 2 grands (even more in Europe). Nikon thought it well, and it gives you no choice: wanna the best wide and worldwide performance on a 24x36 FF ? Empty your plastic. It is simple as that.The conclusion is that upgrading to D700, although fascinating from image quality point of view, latitude of photographic creativity and performance will cripple your financial health. Of course, this holds true if you don't opt for a tammy or another cheap glass for your D700, which case might prove that you are... strange.Body, controls, ergonomicsWho owns a D300 will immediately notice two annoying things: disappearance of the CF compartment lever and a smaller (=shorter) top LCD panel. The prism block is not so evident at first look, though obvious when putting both cameras side by side.The CF card compartment has a D80/D40/D60 way of access, by sliding it open. This compromises the weatherproofing of the entire camera and if you are curious if I'm right, just try using it under rain. I've used my D300, I don't have the guts to do the same with the D700. One might argue that the popup flash (present on both D700 and D300) is also a weak link and I agree, however, having a sliding lid for CF compartment is a downgrade in my opinion and the most ZZZZ thing (replace with the metaphor of your choice) somebody could do with with such a camera. A minus 10 stars for that alone.The dimensions of the top LCD might or not be an issue. However, more important is the cropping of the viewfinder to 95% coverage from the 100% of the D300/D3. Some say \"because of the popup flash\". Probably. Popup flashes have junk efficiency anyway, so why to cripple view in the viewfinder for this reason - it beats me. Moreover, try using the popup flash with a longer lens - nice effects you get !So, Nikon, no excuse for the CF compartment lid and the viewfinder coverage which IS very important for composition.The distance between the grip and the lens is slightly smaller than on D300. For me - it is a good thing since I have better reach for the function buttons on the right side of the lens, but I suppose this may be an issue for those with thicker fingers.The multifunction wheel is more protrusive and the center selection button is something very useful. This IS an improvement over D300 when pushing the center of the multifunction wheel may accidentally activate other switches of the wheel. This was quite annoying especially when writing comments or labels for functions and settings.Aside from these, the rest is identical with the D300. Ah, oh, I forgot: the unlocking lever for the CF compartments from D300 has been replaced with an \"info\" button which reminds me of the never-dying \"print\" button on the Canon bodies. Useless for such a camera. However, this may be debated. I leave it to you. I prefer to have better sealing.Versus D3It is arguable if spending almost double will bring you something of such a tremendous value that will worth the money. I don't think so, at least for the serious amateurs and maybe some of the pros also. However, D3 is quite different from fps point of view and some other \"minor\" differences (two CF cards, locking lever for CF compartment, no popup flash = better sealing etc) which might compel some of you to spend even more.ConclusionMan, but I wrote a lot ! The idea behind all this is that D700 IS THE ultimate a serious amateur may wish for now. Together with D3 has the best high ISO noise and color performance, excellent low ISO noise (= absence, different from D300 which is somewhat noisy on solid colors), FANTASTIC color accuracy for normal shooting conditions (ISO 100-800), incredible focus accuracy, cool feeling when handheld and, coupled with latest Nikkors - superb optics, sharpness, color balance and a very artistic (but realistic) look of the images. However, this comes at a price, you need expensive optics to match the body performance. The choice is yours. I made mine: I'll gonna wait for a while and make a smooth transition from the superb D300 DX to completely new (and certainly better) photographic horizons.I hope this review will help you.Happy holidays12/21/2008", "Date": "December 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "D700 - just wonderful!", "Author": "Uncle \"Trav\"", "ReviewID": "R3OC3RQDC7ZXL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been taking pictures for about 40 years as a hobby.  During that time, I have gone through numerous cameras as technology has progressed but have avoided the full D-SLR stuff until last year when I jumped into the Nikon D90 world.  This is a great serious amateur camera and certainly was one of the best cameras I have ever had.  However, when I decided to move up to the full frame D700 I was concerned that the upgrade would not be worth the cost.  After using the camera now for about 2 months, I am totally blown away by the results that I am able to get with this camera.  AND the cost is worth it if you are really into quality.  The 16bit color depth is just unbelievable.  (now - I will need to upgrade to full Photoshop CS from Elements because Elements will not convert the 16 bit color into jpeg.) I did like the 'Rule of Thirds' grid in the view finder better on the D90 than the circular/grid on the D700. The abilty to quickly focus with the 51 focus(& 3D Matrix) points over the 11 points on the D90. Now, I have not had the opportunity to use or test any of the other large mega pixel cameras from Canon or the $5k plus D3 so I can't compare the D700 to those cameras. But if I compare the 12mb 8bit raw image from the D90 to the 12mb 16bit raw image from the D700, it is VERY noticible how much better the D700 is.  All of the other features and functionality are just great.  It did not take too much to convert the D90 button/menu functionality to the D700.  I love the virtual horizon feature particularly when you assign it to the function button and can use it in the view finder versus the Liveview mode. Too much to say and not enough space here.  Just a great camera.

For me the coolest thing is being able to use my old (incredibly sharp) AI and AIs manual-focus lenses.  None of that conversion-factor nonsense.  The D700's full-frame capability is especially great if the thrill of your Vivitar 135mm is gone and you can now appreciate wide-angle lenses. My 20mm Nikkor AI lens is once again -- gosh -- a 20mm lens. It works just like it did on my F2 -- only the camera body that it's attached to is light-years beyond the F2.When you combine the D700's astonishing low-light/low-noise capability with those old f/1.4, f/2 and f/2.8 lenses, you're in low-light photo-hog heaven. Strobe? What strobe?Most used Nikon lens prices are pretty reasonable, AF or manual focus. Any lens made after 1977 should work on the D700.  AF lenses should work with no issues and manual lenses (AI and AIs) will work fine on aperture-priority and manual modes. And any Nikon lens made before 1977-78 can be \"AI'd\" (modified to AI specifications -- have a pro do it) for cheap.Yes, I do wish that the D700 offered the option of additional manual-focusing aids of the kind seen on the old F cameras.  Focusing with just the screen is a bit slow and imprecise, and it's distracting to keep looking at the little white focusing indicator at the bottom of the screen.  For fast moving subjects I use Nikkor AF zooms.So man up.  March into the bedroom and announce that you're going to buy a D700 and that's that. You're the man of the house and you've earned it, right? (Fallback argument -- it's the BMW of cameras, and so much cheaper.)

It replaced my 3-year old and retiring Nikon D200, which I have put well over 100,000 images through (and it's still going strong.)I'm an actual photographer, not a camera-aholic who buys camera equipment and lenses as \"collection\".  So a camera that \"feels right in my hand\" is very important to assist my creative productivity flow.The camera have a very solid construction, it is said to use a thicker magnesium body than the D300 and D200, and is very water-resistant (one reviewer used the camera for 4+ hours in the rain with absolutely no problem).For the first time, I have absolutely no worry about setting my ISO at 6400 and know for a fact the images will come out far superior than that would produce on my old D200 with iso of just 640, sharpness and resolution wise. The High ISO performance is astonishing on D700, thanks to Nikon's full frame 12mp sensor (the exact same sensor that's been used in Nikon's top of the line D3). The sensor's default setting produces neutral, film like results, with the ability to fully customize color/contrast/sharpness.The ability to produce 14bit raw files would put some of the most critical photographer on the ease, knowing that they will not compromise on the shadow and highlight details while shooting in 14bit raw. However, in my field test the difference is impossible to distinguish with human eye, it can only be detected with the aid of a histogram.I love the cameras ability to customize at least 3 different function keys for various tasks (the DOF button, Function button and AE/AF-Lock button). The ability to use the en-el4a battery with the MB-D10 grip is a huge plus (although the grip, adapter, the battery itself and the charger for battery costs well over $500 dollars), it enables the ability to shoot well over 2,000 images on a single battery charge, and amazing 8.1fps frame rate (16 raws continues shooting, or unlimited jpgs)The LCD screen is truely a joy to stare at, it offers 3x more pixels than the old 320x240pixel screen. With 178 degree viewing angle, and anti-glare coating all help ensure accurate color rendition. (mine comes with 1 stuck pixel however that's not noticeable unless screen is displaying complete black)If you've used Nikon's DSLR before, you'll be at home with D700's menu system, very intuitive with a help function which explains every setting on the fly. Some really useful features include: Self sensor cleaning, Mirror lockup, Multiple exposure, Intravelmeter, Visual horizon and much much more.Nikon's Speedlight flash system is the best in the industry, and Canon's offerings are all far behind. This camera's build-in flash can remotely control SB-900/800/600 flashes to be fired at distance. Nikon's i-TTL metering is spot on every time during most normal shooting situations.Some little detail that I really appreciate is the build in rubber caps for the accessory socket and the pc flash sync socket, now I would never have to worry about losing those little caps anymore.Rival Canon 5D Mark II have the pixel count advantage and the ability to record videos, which would attract a lot of photographers who's also doing motion film works, or landscape photographers who want the absolute highest resolution at lowest iso settings, downside of the 5d mk ii is the increased noise pass iso 1600, lower frame rate, cheaper build, and lower quality lens offerings. Oh wait, did I mention about the ultra tiny buttons that's impossible to press when wearing gloves during winter time?I would highly recommend Nikon D700 for it's serious high iso performance and incredible usability.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mixed Blessing", "Author": "J. Blaha, Jr", "ReviewID": "R1PAW9JWG8POOP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The main reason to upgrade to the D700 is for the low noise at 6400 ISO in dark scenes and possibly the ability to get wider angle shots with traditional Nikon lenses, assuming you don't already own a wide angle DX lens like the Nikon 10.5mm f/2.8 DX Fisheye or the Tokina 11-17 f/2.8.  If you are upgrading for any other reason to the D700, simply to have that BIG FX sensor, it may be a waste of money.  Some of the newer Nikon DSLRs have more resolution, better controls, and better high ISO noise mitigation in-camera than the D700.It makes logical sense that a larger sensor with larger pixels will give you lower noise at high ISOs, however that's only part of the equation.  The in-camera processing, as it converts the raw 14 bit sensor information into an 8-bit jpg file with only 255 levels of red, green, and blue, must perform in-camera processing (reduction) before writing the final image to your memory card.  Even though a sensor may be bigger and natively cleaner than another sensor, it does not mean that the bigger sensor always wins.  An example might be the new back-illuminated CMOS sensors that outperform older technology CMOS sensors that are larger.When I tested out the D700 at the highest 25600 ISO, I found it to have high-frequency noise and bluish banding that looked very distracting.  If I compare these shots with ones from a Nikon D7000 DX at 25600 ISO, the D7000 shots look much cleaner out of the camera.  There are ways to clean the noise out of the D700 shots, but do you really want to shoot in raw and then post-process every one of your super-high ISO shots in Photoshop, Capture, or DXO Optics Pro to get rid of the noise?  If not, the D7000 gives a much more useable photo at this insane 25600 ISO.  In addition to the bluish bands visible across the D700 test shots, there were quite a few hot pixels clearly visible.  It's possible that my D700 sensor might have been getting hot from too many previous photos and was showing excessive thermal noise or perhaps the camera simply left the factory with a bad sensor.  In the end, I had to return my D700, something I've never done with any other Nikon camera.At the more reasonable 6400 ISO, the D700 and D7000 look remarkably similar.  Given the larger pixel well sizes in the D700, the two models should NOT look so similar at 6400 ISO, but they do!  On the D700 at 6400 ISO, I attempted to recreate a sample wedding photo that Nikon USA posted for their professional body D3, which is supposed to be the same sensor as the D700, but the clarity out of camera with default settings did not look jaw-dropping,but was still very clean.  At 6400 ISO, my D700 showed multiple hot pixels, which seemed a little sad for such a nice FX camera, again maybe I simply bought a bad sample.  Every FX camera, including the D700 will have an issue with vignetting, where the corners of the image look noticeably darker due to the light falloff at the edge of the lens.  Even when tested with a nice quality Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 VR lens, the corners remained noticeably darker on the D700.  That same lens on the D7000 produces great shots, because only the center 'sweet-spot' area is used due to the cropping factor.  This vignette is technically lens specific and can be corrected in Photoshop, but why hassle, unless you like the look of it.As for some background, I shot pro photography in LA for a short time and have owned a number of Nikon digital and film cameras over the last 31 years, including the D70, D200, D300, D7000 and D700.  There are some great in-depth reviews by Ken Rockwell with high ISO sample photo comparisons.  If you already own a lot of Nikon lenses and want to keep the same 35mm FX feeling, the D700 may still be a great choice.  If you go with FX, don't forget to look at the just-released D800 first which boasts three times higher resolution and is two years newer in technology.  If you're getting the D700 for clean high ISO shots, I think you should take a very serious look at the D7000 as a solid contender with newer technology and newer noise algorithms at half the cost.  If you are on a budget and will be shooting telephoto with high ISO in dim light, then again the D7000 comes out ahead, because the 1.5 cropping factor will make a 200mm lens act like a 300mm lens on the D7000.  Considering that good zooms are expensive, the D7000 gets you closer to the action using the same lens.Amazon, like most Nikon-authorized dealers, offers a 15 or 30 day return or exchange policy on all cameras, so order what you want and make sure you really like it and test it out to your satisfaction, once it arrives.  Even though the reviews are limited for the newly-released D800, I will predict that if you reduce the 36.3MP FX sensor photos down to 12MP via in-camera processing, that the noise at high ISO will look the same, if not better, than the D700 due to pixel averaging.  (Astro-photographers have used this trick for years to get more sensitivity out of their astronomical CCDs and reduce noise by combining the pixels in a process called binning)I'm just nit-picking here and don't think you can go wrong with any of these Nikon DSLR cameras for serious DSLR power, but just remember that it's not all about the camera, but more about the photographer behind the camera.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "D700 - WOW!

Not wanting to buy into \"old\" technology, I resisted purchasing the D700.  Finally, the D800 came out and had about everything I could ask for however I was a little disapointed to see a 36mp sensor plus only 4 frames per second burst rate.  As time has gone on, popularity of the D800 has create a wait list of months, if I wanted one I'd shell out $3K and have to wait 2-3 months.  With the drop in price of the D700 down to $2200, I decided the to go ahead and take the plunge and scoop one of these up now.  If I didn't like it, I could probably sell it for 80-90% of what I paid; call it a rental.I can't say anything other than I am completely impressed and VERY happy with the decision; I will be keeping this camera.  At first glance, the camera didn't seem to be a whole lot more than what my D7000 was in terms of it's look, feel, usability, etc.  Yes, it's definately larger, but a few things felt as though they were a bit of a step back.  I put on my 50mm 1.8G lens, snapped a few pics in the dark and though it looked as though the images were maybe a little cleaner at higher ISO's, maybe not dramatically so.  I started to have that small incling of buyers remorse.  Did I really just drop $2200 to get a meager 1 stop improvement in ISO and lost video?Having now shot with this camera for a few days and spending some time going through menus and getting comfortable with it, the camera has really grown on me.  First of all, I wanted to really verify the low light improvement on this camera over my D7000 and I believe it to be much more than just that one stop.  I have run some side by side comparisons now and I am easily getting 1-2 stops better images in higher ISO's.  So what I could shoot at ISO 800 on my D7000, I feel like I can work in ISO 3200 and get the same image quality (actually better as I can tell dynamic range is holding up better).  Better yet, when applying noise reduction inside Lightroom the NEF files are responding much better on the D700 files over the D7000.  So I genuinely feel I'm getting at least 2 stops and maybe a bit more out of this camera; sweet!The good doesn't stop there, the metering and focus performance on this camera are a clear step above.  Working in all exposure modes I'm finding this meter to hit nearly perfect exposures almost all the time in almost any conditions.  I almost feel guilty letting it do it's magic and make all the decisions for me; but it's doing it right and definately better than the D7000 out of the box.  Slight adjustment of maybe a 1/3 stop up or down here and there and that's about it.Autofocus performance with my glass (Tokina 100mm Macro, Nikon 24-70mm 2.8, Nikon 70-300mm 5.6) is faster (noticably; though maybe not dramatically) but accuracy seems a cut above as well.  I've yet to shoot action, but I'm cofident we're going to have a great performer here as well.When it comes to taking great pictures, let's face it, what else matters other than the sensor resolution/iso performance, metering abilities, and autofocus performance?  In all three cases, this camera outshines the D7000 and that is what makes this camera truly a DREAM to work with.  I should mention here that the viewfinder is also nearly 50% larger than what is in my D7000.  Looking into that now makes it feel like a toy; yuck, how could I ever go back to an APC/Crop camera again?I now completely understand all the people out there who swear by this camera and feel this is really all they will ever need.  The fact I am dealing with 12mp 14-bit files (15-20MB/ea) as opposed to massive 70MB files (D800) helps, not to mention hand held sharpness is much easier to nail and diffraction on this camera really won't start to become a factor until about F16/F22 instead of F8/F11 on D800 have me perfectly convinved this was the right purchase for me.  The only feature I miss is the video, perhaps the forthcoming D600 will be the answer, but I'm convinced this camera at this price is a bargain for any serious amateur/enthusist or professional photographer.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon gets it right all around", "Author": "Micah", "ReviewID": "R2FYVXUQNDY8OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a former f100 owner, I have strange feelings of deja-vu holding this camera and looking through it.And then I realize how far things have come in the past 9 years.This camera is what many have been waiting for.

It's FX format digital sensor means you actually get the most use out of your wide angle lens.  Plus, because of the size of the senor, you get much much better noise management.  How much better?  Well, I took it out of the box, attached my 80-200mm f2.8 (non vibration reduction mind you) braced myself and took a shot at ISO 2500, in a dark room with only the tv on as lighting.  The picture was taken at 1/40th at f/2.8, and as I zoomed in to see how bad the noise was going to be I actually gasped!!!  There was some, yes, but nothing that any rudimentary noise reduction software couldn't fix.  We're talking minimal.  The reason for the excitement?  I had been shooting weddings in dark churches at ISO 1600 with my D300, wishing that I could eak out more light without all the noise.  With this camera I can!  The last wedding I shot was in a darkly lit church and I rarely dropped below ISO 800 (and actually shot at 1600 the majority of the time with no ill effect).  This camera is truly remarkable.  If you shoot a lot of low light, don't want to use flash, and want to be able to get really wide angle shots, then this is a camera you absolutely have to consider.  If you shoot outdoors all the time, use a lot of flash, or shoot a lot of wildlife (birding or big-game type stuff) this isn't the camera for you.  The FX sensor means your 200mm zoom really only goes to 200mm instead of the 300mm that DX users are used to.  That means that if you need serious length you have to buy longer and longer lenses and these can get really pricey.If you are looking for the perfect \"run after your kids\", professional, great for landscapes and fine art, and superb for photo-journalistic and event photography camera, then this is what you are looking for.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Upgrade from D7000 (If you are experienced)", "Author": "Randal A.", "ReviewID": "R20D1E6BMG4BUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the D7000 for about a year and decieded to go \"full frame\" because I needed the improved image quality within a larger camera sensor.

I have owned so many Nikon bodies: D5000, D3100, D90. I currently own the D7000 and just bought the D700. All I can say is this as good as the D7000 is the D700 is just that much better. Probably due to the fantastic sensor in the D700 (D3 sensor) the 51-focus points are amazing. I am not knocking the D7000 for the money its the best APS-C camera. Though I had finished buying all the trinity lenses (14-24, 24-70, 70-200) as sharp as the lenses were on the D7000 they are even sharper on the D700! Dpreview also shows that the trinity lenses are slightly sharper on FX bodies over the DX bodies.Anyway, back to the D700. Keep in mind this is a pro-level camera. There are no \"scene\" modes only: Aperture, Program, Shutter and Manual modes. FX has more dynamic range than the Nikon DX bodies. I am blown away at the quality of this camera body. I doubt I will ever shoot with DX again (my wife uses the D7000) it is just that good. I used to shoot in full manual but my first day out shooting a car show I setup the D700 in Aperture priority and even AUTO-ISO which I had never used before. Granted it was a bright sunny day so I knew the ISO wouldn't bounce around much since the light was consistent. I also used AUTO-AREA focus mode (I normally only use SINGLE POINT) for me it was a test to see how well this camera would perform on it's own. I have to say I was blown away. Even with the D7000 using Auto-Area Focus Mode I could barely get 3-5 focus points to light up at one time. On the D700 I easily got 8-13 focus points, I was able to shoot wide open with the 24-70 @ f2.8 and the entire vehicle was in focus (See my sample pics posted up top!). I took the shots home and out of 139 shots I took only 4 didn't not come out good, not due to focus just exposure issues and I didn't like the angle of the shots. That is a very high keeper rate!I didn't purchase the D700 at Amazon, I bought it at the Nikon Store (USA) and paid only $2159 for a factory refurbished camera! It came with a 90-day factory warranty and only 500 shutter count. I sold my D90 on Amazon for more than I originally paid for it and my cost of the D700 was under $1500! I highly recommend this camera it's just an incredible piece of equipment and I will always be a loyal Nikon Shooter for LIFE!Also note, not one bad review on this camera body! Mostly 5 stars!

It is frankly too much camera for most people but if you want less camera, you may need to forego the full frame capability, and also deal with a half or all plastic body camera. I assume you do not want to (and should not) compromise and get less than a full framed sensor. I also assume you do not care about having a camera which does video, and make nice espressos as well.At this price point (low two thousand) D700 is a great camera...not necessarily because it is worth it, but because all others at this price point are nowhere as good.case in point, the beloved and beautiful leica X1 goes for about $2,000. it takes good pictures but it is a toy. D700 costs you a bit more but is a real camera.use of D700 with any zoom lens feels a bit funny, and unmatched...there is no handgrip, and the camera body is a bit small for larger zoom lenses (e.g. 70 to 200mm nikon lens)...for that D3S is a better matched body. I have the D3S but do not think the price difference is worth it. It is a better camera but i do not see any difference between the quality of my pictures on D3S versus D700. having said, i do not regret having paid $3,000 more for my D3S!!! it feels better as a camera in particular with zoom lenses...capture 2 or whatever software comes with nikon: forget that. don't waste your time downloading it.D700 is a serious camera. even if you use zoom lenses and do not want to spend the extra amount on the D3S, you are fine. You still have a great camera and can laugh at those like me who bought the D3S.Now, for serious candid shots, street photography which is what i am mainly interested in, D700, in particular used with a zoom lens, still draws too much attention, and people may think you are a professional photographer, or have some money, so it is still too much attention grabber for my taste. On a recent trip abroad, i got stopped by the police asking me what I was taking pictures of.If you see my review of D3S and D700, i have rated both cameras at 4/5. maybe D3S deserves to be a half a star higher than D700, but in terms of value, D700 is at about one star higher than D3S.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Full Frame Beauty", "Author": "Richard Pissillo", "ReviewID": "R9HEOS0G0VY9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned it for over a month now and this seems to be the digital SLR I've wanted since I stopped using my old Nikon F. I have owned the D200 and D300, but as expected, this surpasses all. You really need to look through the viewfinder to appreciate the beauty of full frame. It is as if someone turned on the light. And with a fast lens, it is so much brighter than a cropped sensor camera. I added Nikon's magnifying eyepiece and rubber cup - as a result I use autofocus a lot less.The other aspect that sets this camera apart is its ability to render color. It is hard to articulate, but there is a certain \"rightness\" to the colors.There are too many features to discuss, but one that I really have come to appreciate is auto ISO. In low light situations, the full frame sensor is simply masterful at letting you shoot at ISO 3200 when needed.This camera cries out for good glass. Do not put a cheap lens on this camera! Not only will it expose any fault a lens has, but you will cheat yourself out of the superb results this camera will yield. I splurged for the 24-70 f2.8, and it is a marvelous lens, very sharp and contrasty, albeit large, somewhat ostentatious and heavy. I am getting some unwanted \"that's a big camera\" comments.

I'll give a bulleted list of the high points:The sensor is full frame, meaning old film lenses no longer have a crop factor built in.  Ultra wide angle on this camera is 19-20mm, not the 12mm of a DX lens.  My 19-35mm cost me $100 and is as good as a DX format lens 12-24mm costing four times that.The ISO range is huge, in good light ISO 6400 is usable, in dim light you can go up to ISO 5000.  There's a maximum of ISO 25,400 but it's pretty much useless.  The dynamic range (going from how dim the light is in an image to how bright) is fantastic, pictures taken with an ISO under 2500 have bright, clear colors and and good rendition.Up to ten older manual focus (non-CPU) lenses can be specified in the menu.  Why use old lenses?  How about a Russian 1100MM mirror lens, or a 300mm F4.5 lens?  As long as it has the right mount you can use it, that includes almost every Nikon lens back to 1977 (1959 to 1976 can be converted) and a host of lenses from other manufacturers.  The only ones that won't work are the IX-Nikkors and a few exotics.  Manual focus still has a place, especially for dim lighting or scenes that have a difficult composition.It's built like a tank, and has a big, clear LCD screen that can be seen from almost any angle.I've used this camera at numerous conferences, airshows, and other events.  The only demerits I have against it are minor, such as:It's big, heavy and expensive.  8 frames per second is possible (normal is 5), but you have to use the accessory battery grip AND the large EN-EL4A battery AND the correct battery door cover.  That's expensive and makes it larger than a D3.  However this high frame rate came in handy at an air show where I honestly shot 3,200 frames (one quarter of my entire use of the camera) on a single charge.  Is it worth it?  For catching an F-15 going Mach 0.95 yes it is.It has no movie mode, which is now the rage on DSLR cameras.  There's a Yin and a Yang to that.  The Yin is a DSLR gives you an interchangeable lens feature that previously only expensive movie cameras had.  This lets you get wide angles, zooms, low light, narrow depth of field, and so on.  The Yang is the movie mode is much more primitive than camcorders have, without the full manual controls that are needed.  I just bought a dedicated camcorder for when I need it.It uses Compact flash in a day when SDHC is all the rage, but Compact is faster.Sensor cleaning--all DLSR's will get dust on their sensor (or more properly the cut-off filter in front of the sensor).  The CCD has an electrical charge when the camera is turned on and therefore attracts dust.  It happens when you change lenses, and nothing short of being in a clean room will stop it. Cleaning the filter is not for the faint hearted and takes a lot of patience. The D700 has a \"sensor clean\" option in the menu that jiggles the sensor to shake the dust off, but it always seems my camera has more dust when it finishes as it's loosening up the dust at the side of the sensor.  Regardless, it's the one real chore in using a DSLR.Lastly is the simple truth, the camera takes only photos as good as you are.  I've become a much better photographer from my experience with the D700, and I hope it lives out it's projected life of 150,000 frames, but unless you have the drive or need for a camera like this you're better off with something else.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid, man.", "Author": "David Siegfried", "ReviewID": "R2KWQP6P5O564D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably the most reliable full frame digital camera Nikon has produced to date.

Combining that with the bright, clear, viewfinder I feel comfortable with the camera and can concentrate on composing the photograph.The only shortcoming that I have noticed is that occasionally photos seem overexposed by half a stop.

My primary camera was a Konica T-1 (a relatively simple 35mm SLR) and I used it for about 20 years.About 4 years ago I purchased my first digital camera. It was a Minolta. It produced fine pictures, but was very slow to start up and a real battery pig.About 2 years ago I purchased a Canon 350-D digital SLR. I have to say that I was never very happy with that camera. Although it started up almost instantly and would shoot 3 FPS, it produced what can only be called poorly focused images. I also did not like how long it would take to switch settings. For point and shoot it did pretty well except for my continued frustrations with the autofocus. Thankfully, that camera and its lenses were stolen from my car in Italy last Summer. I have been on the hunt for a new camera ever since. I read extensively and despite my love for Art Wolfe's work (he is a Canon user) had made the decision to give Nikon a chance.It has been a great decision. The D-700 (and also a D-90 that a friend has...tho DX format), give me tremendous control over all my shots. Changing white balance, ISO settings or anything for that matter is a snap. I have three lenses...an old school 28mm/f2.8 non-auto focus I picked up used for $135 (did I mention that unlike Canon...Nikons work with all the old lenses too), the excellent 50mm/f1.4 AF Nikon lens I bought here at Amazon and a 70-300 AF/VR Nikon lens I bought else where. All three lenses are Nikon. Funny...my favorite lens is the 28mm.The autofocus's operation is foolproof from my perspective. If it is focusing wrong, it is almost always because I told it to do what it ended up doing. A dramatic improvement from my experience with the Canon (admittedly...the Canon I had before was a much lower price class). I srongly prefer the Nikon methodology of controlling WB/ISO/Quality and the mods of A/S/P. Switching settings is much faster than with the Canon.I have especially enjoyed the flexibility of the control with white balance. It is so easy to warm things up or cool them down (worked out very well in my pictures in Glacier Bay...they SHOULD be blue).I have also been delighted with the AutoISO feature which lets you set minimums for shutter speed and maximums for ISO speed and lets the camera try to give you the lowest noise picture under any lighting condition.

I loved my Nikon D7000 but I had the urge into stepping up and upgrading to my first Full Frame camera.Since the day I got my D700, I don't regret it one bit. This camera is simply amazing. I think AMAZING isn't enough to describe it.I actually purchased the 5D Mark II before I got the D700. It was cheaper, more MP (which doesn't really matter unless you print real large), took video and you got more for the money. After 2 weeks of using it, I returned it back to Amazon and bought me a D700. I could care less about video, I only do photos and when I need to record something I just take my iPhone out.Coming from someone who used the 5D Mark II (which is a great camera), I can honestly say the D700 is without a doubt much better! (For strictly photos). The 5D Mark II had 9 focus points, compared to the 51 of my D700. Although the photo quality of the 5D Mark II was excellent, the ONE THING that REALLLYYY bugged me was that in low light situations, EVEN if you had fast prime lens on it, it would hunt for focus a LOT. It would take about 2-3 seconds to focus under low light, no matter what I was trying to focus on. I HONESTLY prefer the D7000 over the 5D Mark II just based on that standpoint. The comparison between the autofocus system between the 5d Mark II and the D700 is laughable. The D700 blows it out of the water.This Nikon D700, has blown me away.

I'm not going to explain all the marketing mumbo jumbo.  I'm not going to tell you how well the white balance works shooting a studio swatch.What I am going to do, is tell you how well this camera works in the hands of a professional daily photojournalist.Some History -- I am a news photographer and I have been shooting Nikon since college.  While, my first SLR venture was Canon, I began shooting Nikon in college because the department had all the lenses.  I did go back to shooting Canon a few years back when I was at a SoCal newspaper, but my current job outfits Nikon and it's fine with me.  My Nikon digital days go back to the D100.  Originally, I shot Neopan for my studies - a versatile Fuji black & white film.  Many of my 35mm projects were shot with the F100, F3 or the Fm2.  However, the bulk of my work came from a 6x6 Hasselblad 501c - that big negative just can't be beat.  However, times did change and I shot the last year of my schooling with a D2h, which eventually saw two rebuilds and nearly 300,000 frames before I finally had to let it go on eBay.  So here we are.What has been expensive about digital, is since the original D1, Nikon and Canon have seen fit to release new cameras, and thus new sensors - and even sensor formats - at a blisteringly frustrating pace.  This is not always bad news as the D1 and D1h suffered awful banding above 640 ISO.  The D100 and D70 clipped highlights too easily and the DX format just didn't give you all that your lenses may have been machined for.  But hopefully, those days are over.  After more than three years of daily use, I can say the D700 is effectively the F100 of digital - it isn't the pinnacle, but it is a solid workhorse for good money.  This is not only the first affordable Nikon 35mm sized sensor camera, it is also one that feels as if digital can finally hold it's head level - and in some ways - above color neg film.  Obviously the D3(s) is probably the best out there, the D700 does about 90% the same for nearly 50% the cost.  Not a bad deal.What I love-Typical, simple Nikon operation:  large buttons, simple menus (compared to the labyrinthine Canon software)-Excellent molded grip-Solid and straight forward operation-Consistent metering.  As I always shoot manual and though Matrix metering is good, a good photographer doesn't rely 100% on the green bars in their viewfinder.  Know what the meter is seeing and adjust as necessary.  Center weighted still gives really good results you knew from the F3 days. I never use Aperture or shutter priority so look up a techie review for that stuff.-Excellent exposure tolerance.  If you f-up and overexpose a stop, you haven't killed all your highlights.  ALMOST neg film territory (still not even close to B&W; territory)-Big old-style viewfinder-It works with just about any Nikkor made since the 1960s.-RELIABLE as hell-Frickin' amazing high ISO performance.  6400 is actually useable if you have some bit of light to expose for AND you hit the exposure. (This is where the D700 kills color neg film for good)What is good-Color is alright, but don't think you will get Fujichrome Velvia out of this without tinkering in Photoshop-Weather sealing is \"good\" not \"great\"-Autofocus is good, but please know AF speed and accuracy has just as much to do with particular lenses as it does with the camera body.-The price isn't cheap - but it is something you can live with.What needs work-Battery life with the  EN-EL4 is liveable, but could be better-Nikon has yet figured out a good way to keep the sensor free of dusty particles.  The auto clean function isn't useless, but not very useful.  If you shoot over f/11 - it can get ugly.  Keep plenty of air cans handy.-The vertical grip attachment adds more bulk than I'd like to the camera profile-Despite technological advances, not anywhere near as light, or durable, as my decades old F3/TWhat I hate about digital in general- Despite what people seem to love doing these days, gray scaling your images in photoshop is not the same in any way as actually shooting on black and white stock.  Digital is simply outclassed in nearly every way in that category.  Digital cameras either are about balanced exposure or slight underexposure.  Black and white is about expose for the shadows - develop for the highlights. In other words - over expose.  This is something you simply cannot do with silicon.For the past few years, I have found the D700 to be a true work companion.  It is reliable as can be and I don't need to rely anywhere near as much on photoshop as the old days digital.  If you are outfitted with Nikon glass and you make your living with a camera, you really can't go wrong here.  That is unless Nikon release something better next week - welcome to the digital age.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I finally like digital.", "Author": "But I'm feeling much better now...", "ReviewID": "R37KPZVFPMSA72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been trying to relive the feeling I got shooting Ektachrome and Kodachrome for years.  Especially printing on Ilford Pearl paper.  Somehow, my D200 and D300 (let alone my $1K 995) always fell short, and I tried to make up for that by shooting HDR exposures.  It was a real joke on the photo trips I've been on, firing off nine frames at a time.  The first couple of days after I bought this camera, I was shooting along the Chicago river with a group.  This was the final bridge raising for people to get their boats out of Lake Michigan to safety for the winter.  I didn't bother to read the manual except on how to map the function button to use the virtual horizon feature, which I thought was neat.  Here I am, standing in the shadows under a bridge and trying to figure out how to bracket exposure for HDR.  There is no bracket button on the camera, unlike the D200 or D300.  I give up, and just start shooting.  I'm underneath a raising bridge, shooting a sailboat, with a bright sky and the Tribune Building in the background.  I shot a couple hundred frames in a couple of hours, following the boats down the river, when I got home I expected nothing.  I later found out I had remapped the Fn button from bracket to virtual horizon.  Lo and behold, I was able to pull out shadows beneath the bridge, clouds, the \"Chicago Tribune\" lettering on the building, and even the John Hancock's building antennas in the distance.  This is all with a wide angle Nikkor 14-24 lens, so it's not like I was zooming anywhere, let alone a half mile away.  I just can't say enough good things about this camera's exposure latitude and detail retention.  I'll still bracket, but not be obsessive about it.On a more practical level, I did not want to buy this camera.  I kept thinking a new model is coming out, so I would wait.  But, I injured my right hand really bad, which will most likely take another 6 months to heal, and I figured the ISO boost along with some fast lenses, would at least let me to get out shooting again.  I'm happy, I set the ISO to go up to 3200 on auto, went out shooting, and those shots with a little bit of noise reduction are fine.  With my D200 the limit was about 400, with my D300 realistically 800.  The first shot I took with this camera was in my apartment, and I couldn't believe that a black light stand in front of a black subwoofer still showed definition.Keep in mind that low light shots at ISO's higher than 3200 are going to show noise.  A lot of noise in low light.Also on a practical level, I was also able to use all of my D300's accessories,  except for a right angle viewfinder and a diopter adapter.  Plus, this model has been going down in price.  I bought this and a Nikkor 14-24 as a combo from Amazon for about 3650, the equivalent locally was 1250 more, and I can only imagine the next model will be more money with no instant rebate.[...]I'd get this camera for what it does now, and not wait to pay a whole lot more for the next model.

So I sold all my belongings, along with a few small exotic animals and upgraded from a still amazing D90 to this amazing piece of machinery. Yeah, 2k is a lot of money to drop on a camera that will be obsolete in about 5 years, but if you do low light photography there is nothing in this price range that can compete... or even comes close to trying to compete. Add on any of Nikon's 1.4 prime lenses, or a 2.8 zoom (I use the 24-70 which is a jaw dropper) and see if you can ever go back to anything else. Coming from the D90, the biggest pluses are the low noise at high ISO, and the blazing-fast AF that is an absolute game changer (especially with the 24-70, the combination is just sick, with far fewer out-of-focus pictures or plain ol' missed shots).You know the specs by now. Sony and Canon make great stuff too, but Nikon has them all beat in fit, finish, and feel IMO... and high ISO/low noise and blistering Auto Focus. No, it doesn't have video, but neither does my toaster... but oddly enough, my video camera does. Hmmm...  That being said, I am loving the Interval option to make stop motion video. Fun stuff.I love having my D90 (which now feels amazingly compact in comparison) to take with me on riskier ventures, and the D700 to take on photo sessions and personal shoots. If the rumored D95 comes out soon, I can't imagine me (my business) needing much more than the 700 and either one (or both) of those guys, with a selection of FX-friendly lenses, and a few SB 600/900s.Bottom line: if you are out of debt (thanks Dave Ramsey), have the available funds (even if it's juuuuust barely enough), and need a disturbingly amazing low-light camera, get the D700.

Including the 300 I have owned the E510, E520, and E30.  I love the in-camera stabilization and the multiplier the 4/3 system gives me with lenses, but the poor low ISO capabilities frustrate me.  It seems most of my shooting is in a gym, theater, or church.  Anything above ISO 640 and I am disappointed with the amount of noise.I tried the D700 and was anxious to see if it lived up to its billing for low light prowess.  Unreal is all I can say.  ISO 6400 is not only usable, but better than I normally try to salvage at ISO 800 on the E30.  I went to the Omaha Zoo this last weekend with my grandchild and shot ISO 6400 constantly in some of the venues like the Aquarium and Madagascar. I am thrilled with the result.  I have two weddings to shoot in June and I am anxious to try it out in a church setting.  I found the white balance very good.  The colors were bright and natural.  I found I had very little post processing in CS3.  I am using cheap lenses until I can build up my war chest again, but the Nikon 50mm F1.8 is bright and a steal.I can work the Olympus menu in my sleep, but I found the Nikon menus intuitive and adjusted quickly.  I would like a faster way to set the ISO.  It may be that I have not read far enough to see a short cut.I can't part with the E30 yet.  I love the rich warm colors of the pictures and Olympus has great digital lenses. I can see that the Nikon will dominate indoors and allow me to shoot discreetly.

Fantastic!", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3910LD8PJQKF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The one and only reason why I keep upgrading DSLRs is because the one failing I've found with all of my cameras (Canon Rebel XTi, Nikon D80 then Nikon D300) is that they perform very poorly in low light situations. Cranking up the ISO produces ugly noise that absolutely rankled me since I used to be a B&W; film photographer.  I liked Tri-X grain and would even push it to exaggerate the grain but DSLR noise is an awful distracting mush.I could have bought a perfect condition used Nikon D3 for a very reasonable price for not much more than the D700 but in the end I bought the D700 for the following reasons:I wanted the sensor cleaning.I wanted to be able to able to remove the battery when I needed to be more portable. The D3 is a beast. I couldn't imagine walking around with it for hours.  It also draws undue attention.The D3 menu complexity and buttons looked like too much of a learning curve.Yes, true pro cameras don't have a built-in flash but sometimes in a pinch it's nice to have one on-board.  I don't always walk around with an external flash.Having had the D700 for only several hours, these are my initial impressions of the camera (in no particular order).1) The viewfinder is very bright and clearer than the D300.  I always found it difficult to manually focus with the D300 especially without a split prism.2) Having had the D300 for 2 years, the menus are very similar and I was able to make adjustments to the camera and start snapping away within a minute or two.3) I really, really dislike the 90% viewfinder.  I think this is the number one drawback to the camera. I have to guess what is really going to be in the photograph. I'll never be able to frame the picture exactly the way I want. I'll either come in too close and ruin the picture or take what I see in the viewfinder and throw away a megapixel or two. It sometimes makes me wonder if I should have picked up the D3 instead.  Isn't ambivalence fun?4) Why did they have to change the HDMI port?  Now I have to buy a new cable.  Why couldn't throw one in? Even at retail they don't cost more than a few dollars.  For Nikon it would have been a few cents (if that much).5) I like the way the diopter is locked.  You have to pull it out to make a change.  More than a few times I accidentally changed the diopter on the D300.6) The overall response time of the D700 is so much faster than the D300. It's scary fast.7) The shutter is really loud. So much for taking pictures discreetly.  A Leica viewfinder it is not.8) Wow, the camera strap is the worst, cheapest and most uncomfortable POS I've ever had.  I already ordered a replacement. Also the garish Nikon D700 FX logo is a definite 'steal me' sign.  Most Nikons DSLRs (aside from the D3) look alike to the average person but this one really advertises exactly what it is.  Why didn't they just put the MSRP on the strap while they were at it?9) The strap to the remote control cover is a nice touch.  No more losing the covers.10) The ability to close the viewfinder is another nice touch.11) I was able to take some quite decent test pictures at ISO H2.0.  From everything I've read, I expected the pictures to be pure mush.  I was pleasantly surprised.  With a 1.4 lens I can take pictures in very dim lighting environments.The grain at higher ISO speeds (1600-3200) is much more like film grain.  The grain has a nice tight uniform appearance.  For me, this is one of the nicest features of the camera.12) Wide angle lenses are now really wide-angle.  Of course, I lose the extra 50% increase in magnification for the 300mm telephoto.13) The virtual horizon is a such a trip. It's tiring fixing off-angle photos in Photoshop.14) Without the MB-D10 battery pack, the D700 is not that much heavier than the D300. If I wanted to travel very lightly, I can put a small prime lens on the D80.  I stuff the D80 in the car under the seat.  If the D80 was stolen, it wouldn't be a heart breaker.I am going to miss the 18-200mm VR zoom lens. It's lightweight and versatile. The FX zoom lens are extremely expensive and more importantly insanely heavy. I had expected to go FX for a long time so I only own 2 DX lenses.  I have a bunch of good prime lenses. [May 28 update:  I ordered the 70-200 2.8 lens today from Amazon. Yes, it's heavy, big and expensive but I don't want to buy a number of expensive prime lenses]Update May 28, 2010:I've had the camera for a week or two and I love it more and more.  I can now confidently use the Auto-ISO without worrying if the grain from the higher ISO will ruin the photograph.  Depending upon the length of the lens, I'll set the desired aperture and let the ISO go up to 6400.  I hate blurry photos. I wavered for a few weeks about getting the D2s which would have given me an additional 2 usable fstops but since I'm not a professional, I couldn't rationalize the 2x increase in price so I bought a good VR lens instead.The one major failing of Auto-ISO is that it doesn't take the lens length into consideration.  For a wide angle, I can shoot at much lower shutter speeds but with telephotos I need a much high shutter speed.  For a fixed prime lens, if I remember, I can just change the minimum shutter speed but on a zoom (e.g. 70-200) the minimum shutter speed varies.  I wish the camera was smart enough to take the length of the lens into consideration. I put this option into My Menu so that I can quickly find and change the settings.I was photographing flying bees with a 105 2.8 macro lens with a shutter speed of 1000.  Since the bees would dart into the shadows the ISO automatically increased which is something I could never do before (with satisfactory results).I'm still clueless on how to change the settings on the Info button (click button twice).  I've bought David Busch's Nikon D700 Guide to Digital SLR Photography which hasn't helped in the least.  I've read Ken Rockwell's explanation but I still don't get it.  I feel so stupid.I wouldn't recommend this as someone's first DSLR.

Time IS money!No one will ever sell me on the convenience of inferior video from a DSLR.When shooting a wedding and the dancing starts I take off my two camera harness and pick up my 24 mp camcorder and am liberated to shoot the flower toss at 64fps, the first dance at 24fps, recorded in 5.1 surround  and know I will have an awesome still for my clients.The D700 means no crowded sensor, no subtle noise issues, just awesome, mind blowing colorful, sharp and creamy background photographs.Glad I waited to buy 'last years' Rolls Royce' and skip on the new model and pocket the price difference.Nikon is coming out with a new range of lower priced full sensor bodies.I could not see myself spending three grand on the newest toy when cheaper and better performing full sensor bodies are on the horizon.I do not track through the Everglades so I do not need to use my camera bodies to drive nails into trees in the rain!By no means am I saying don't buy the d800. If you have the cash of course buy it. Rich hobbyists are gobbling them up. Bravo!What I am saying, is if you take pictures for a living, then the D700 is more than enough to impress your clients with mind blowing photographs.FYI-I will now be retiring my D7000 as i find it's image/ noise quality inferior to the D90 and will get another d700.I just don't buy into the Rockwell school of more pixels is everything!

I have been using Nikon cameras since the days of film, and have owned the D100, D70, D200 and D300.I jumped at the chance to get the D700 for two main reasons:1), the FX sensor took away the sometimes annoying multiplication factor for focal length2) the wide acclaim this camera has received for operating with very low noise at high ISOs.The FX sensor has breathed new life into my considerable investment in Nikon glass over the years, and the low noise at high ISOs is nothing short of astonishing. I really don't like to shoot with flash (and I have tried everything from built-in flashes to various SB-800s set up with the Nikon CLS system), but with this camera I have been able to shoot indoors at night with low ambient light up to 6400 ISO and produced results that put my previous Nikon DSLRs to shame, with the exception of the D300 which was reasonably good in low light, but had the DX sensor/multiplication issue. Now a 50mm 1.4 lens really IS a 50mm 1.4 lens! Of course, it's not just the sensor and the FX format, it's also about your investment in glass! Nikon Professional Lenses turn this thing into a truly professional, beautiful tool. I have managed some amazing shots with my 50mm 1.4. Even at ISOs higher than 6400, using custom profiles that I post-processed with Noise Ninja software, I have achieved clean, clear shots with very little chromatic noise in the shadows. It has to be seen to be believed.At one point I considered abandoning the Nikon platform in favor of the Canon 5D after having a chance to play around with one that a friend had, and I was especially intrigued by the 5D Mark II. Of course, that would have meant abandoning my investment in Nikon glass, but I was intrigued by the results my friend was getting, and also the higher pixel count. However, there are numerous discussions on the Web and elsewhere about the value of pixel count, and the 12mpx D700 generates super high quality images that withstand considerable enlargement, perhaps due to the favorable pixel density ratio.The controls are very similar to the D300, though it feels a little heavier and sturdier. It does have a somewhat disappointing CF flash flip-open door - the only 'cheap' detail on an otherwise premium body. The rear LCD is much brighter than the D300, and the new viewfinder is bright, clear and a joy to use. I love the virtual horizon feature which displays on the rear LCD. Just as a side note: I am a creative director, and I shoot semi-professionally for some of the projects I get involved in. I was responsible for the Adobe CS1 and CS2 creative suite and individual product packaging, and some of the flowers that appear in the Adobe Illustrator CS1 packaging were shot by me with my D100, what seems like an eternity ago... So I have had to shoot a lot of different subjects in widely variable conditions, and my new D700 will handle whatever I throw at it!Now that FX sensor sizes appear to be within the grasp of what I would call 'affordable' DSLRs, there is a distinct possibility that the DX format (and maybe DX lenses) may not have such a long life span. This is worth considering as camera bodies are certainly an investment, but your investment in lenses is where the real money is, and in the long run may favor non-DX formats.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "My soul mate.", "Author": "Rajesh Ramjit", "ReviewID": "R27ZW935ZWWY2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my new D700 yesterday.

I labored with my decision for months.  I had always wanted the D700 but had begun considering the D7000 due to the much lower price...and lens inventory.  The reviews swayed me left and right and was no closer to making my decision.I decided not to wait any longer and get the D7000, after all, some of the reviews claimed as good or even better at high ISOs.  I only used it for a couple hours and knew it was not the move I expected from the D90.  It made me realize that the D90 is an excellent camera up to ISO 800...I actually have greater respect for my D90 now.  I found the D7000, even though fairly good performance in ISO 1600, was soft.  It reminded me of Canons..whose high resolution are pretty good but soft in low light.  This may be due to excessive noise reduction, so please don't take this as a negative comment about Canons.

It would either be the D3 or the D700. I shant bore you with the details of my reasoning, but in the end I thought the D700 more fitting to my needs. And thus I purchased one.Although I had read just about every single review on the internet of this particular piece of kit, and therefore were quite aware of its abilities, I was still blown away by it, when I got to see it for myself. The ability to shoot handheld in low light at ISO 2000, or indeed 3200, with very little evident noise is a boon of no small measure. It suits my style of shooting very well, and means that you can walk around tripod-less all day in basically any old situation and get away with really nice pictures. In my opinion, this makes it nigh on ideal for travel and street photography, where you more often than not, are better off not burdened with six tons of tripod and extra equipment. At low ISO it produces stunning pictures, of course. The colours, the contrast, well, just about everything, is markedly improved when compared with my D200. Also in the ergonomics and ease-of-use departments, this camera blows me away. I always thought that Nikons cameras where quite user friendly, but although the in-camera menu is the same in the D700 as in previous models, the way in which you use it is not. There is a small info-button that shortcuts to all your necessary functions in the menu, which makes changing your settings a breeze, and more importantly, the things you use a lot, viewing, deleting, magnifying pictures and so on are easy as can be. Build quality is also excellent. Perhaps it doesn't feel like a tank (but then again, tanks are quite a bit bigger, aren't they?), but you know it is a solid piece of machinery you're holding in your hands.There are only two things, really, that I don't care for with the D700. Firstly the viewfinder, although very bright, covers only 95 percent of the frame. Why they didn't make it 100 percent I cannot fathom. They did it on the D3 and the D300, so why not with this particular model? It makes your very careful compositions look less carefully compositioned at times, which I do not care for at all. Secondly the neck strap is, to be honest, not very good. A new third party strap will not set you back an awful lot of money and will not only be more comfortable, but also get rid of that massive yellow printing saying NIKON D700 on the back of your neck.The D700 is definitely one of the most impressive cameras I've ever come across, and can only receive the highest possible recommendation from yours truly.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best", "Author": "W.

Of course, the move to FX comes with the ability to shoot with Nikon's pro lenses again, and the combo of the two gets you back to the kinds of images you remember from your film days. So ... the improvement is part camera, part lens upgrade ... but the results are just fantastic. Now I can use the same lenses for my D700 and my F4 body (backup) which makes packing my backpack a whole lot simpler.For those of you moving up from the D200, the control layout of the D700 is very similar, so there's little learning curve regarding handling. If you are a tripod shooter like me, you'll love the ability to display the camera's settings on the rear display. I haven't found much of a use for live view yet, but I'm still playing with it. You'll find an excellent D700 settings guide out on Ken Rockwell's site.If you are thinking about this camera, just buy it ...

Truth be told, this camera seemed to be ahead of its time as it still outperforms and keeps up with a lot of nikon bodies today. Why did I not buy the D600? For one the oil/dust sensor issue was a large red flag for me. I can't imagine paying over $2000 for something that has a defect. Secondly, it still did not have some of the professional features of the D700 (1/8000 sec shutter speed for instance). It also feels a lot more sturdier than the D600.I upgraded from a nikon D5000 so I was instantly blown away by the performance of this camera. The high ISO performance and fast AF speed was what I needed in a camera, and the D700 provided that plus more. It was really the best full frame option for me at the time and probably will be for the next 2 years or so. Maybe once Nikon acknowledges the D600 sensor problem then I'll look to getting one when the price starts to drop, other than that I'm completely happy with my 4 year old camera. I also got it for a steal compared to the price of the 600; I'll use that money towards some new glass :)Of course the only drawback with this camera is no video capabilities...but I didn't buy it for video so it doesn't matter. I also never really used the video on my D5000.If you're wanting to upgrade from the DX format at the moment, I think the D700 makes a solid choice with a ton of features!", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Ultrarider7", "ReviewID": "R3DNTN4OZH9LPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a 'serious' amateur photographer for almost 40 years.  Actually longer, when you consider the Instamatics, Polaroid Swinger and other childhood cameras.  However, starting in 1972 with a Minolta SRT-101, I've owned many cameras, 35mm and digital.  This is my sixth Nikon SLR, my third DSLR, starting with the D5000, the D300s and now finally the D700.First, let me assure you that I am a fan of digital.  I all but quit using my F-3HP when I purchased the D5000.  I thought the images were comparable to the film images, and the ease of sharing made this decision a no-brainer.  I was hooked on digital.Perhaps it was me, but I didn't fully understand the value of an FX sensor v. a DX.  So when I upgraded last year, I purchased the D300s.  A great camera for the money, and frankly one that I probably could have stayed with longer.I started reading about full-frame sensors, and in addition to a larger viewfinder, I was immediately impressed by the idea that lenses would make sense to me.  My almost 60 year old brain never did get used to the idea that a 18mm was the same as a 24mm.So, before my annual trek, I decided to make the plunge and buy the D700.  I couldn't have been happier.  I used a combination of both my DX lenses and a couple of FX ones I had purchased prior to leaving.  The nice thing about the D700 is that you do not have to do anything except switch the lens and be sure that you remember that the image saved on the sensor is that within the border that now shows in the viewfinder.It's a great camera.  Far beyond anything that I could hope to exceed.  I cannot imagine that I will need to upgrade before wearing the darn thing out, and I understand that it has a life of at least 150,000 shutter activations, so that will be a few years.Yes I could bore you with facts and figures, but let me just say that the camera will give you very satisfying results, both as an expensive point and shoot, and as a tool to create your own exposures.

Video? Yeah that's nice to have, but I was very unhappy with the AF performance, shutter black-out and comfort. Anyway, back to the D700.The big feature Nikon has implemented that brought me over to the \"Dark Side,\" were external AF-mode controls, extra configurable buttons, the ability to customize the camera's controls to MY liking, the ability to shoot 8fps with a battery-grip and 8 AAs (necesssary for me? Hardly, but very nice to have the option), general camera ergonomics. I was planning on keeping my Canon gear since I had mostly L prime lenses that Nikon just doesn't have. I thought I be able to stay in both camps. After using the the D700 for over a month, I decided that even if my Canon primes were far more advanced than the Nikkor counterparts, it was better to sell off the Canon gear that was just sitting and not getting any use. A hard decision, but it just made sense to me.The camera feels very solidly built (compared to the 5DMK2 - no creaking on the battery door). Feels much more comfortable in the hand. There is a nice little finger indentation that helps me hold on better. My hands don't feel cramped after a long day of shooting. AF performance is very accurate. The AF sensor with 51-points is HUGE. So glad that they didn't keep this AF system in the flagship bodies.I can't say anything bad about the D700. It's just a very well designed and built camera. Nikon is really doing it right with their camera bodies and flash system. Now they just need to focus on their prime lenses.If you're a Canon shooter and considering the jump, you'll have to assess the cost of the switch. Thankfully, I was able to recover 80-90% of the cost of my gear. If you have L primes, you'll have to consider that Nikon doesn't have equivalents. I find that the Nikkor primes I use are about as good as the Canon primes I gave up.

The camera is fantastic and works as advertised (and as reviewed by the other 5-star ratings).  Image quality is sharp and clean.  Auto focus is lighting sharp. Viewfinder is large and comfortable. The low light capabilities blows the pants off of my D90.The one noticeable difference is the sheer weight of this camera.  I was used to waving around my D90 with one hand for hours without an issue, but holding this camera with one hand for more than 5 minutes is a bit of a workout.

I came to buy this camera after trying out the 70-200mm VRII lens (fantastic) and I basically wanted my camera to balance out that lens a little better.  I also wanted better low light performance since I don't like to fumble around with a flash.So... from the perspective of someone who was using a D5000 before, here are some of the things I didn't like when I switched to my new D700:1) The shutter sound is much louder than the D5000 and very noticeable when you try to take a bunch of photos in a row.  I've managed to turn a few heads in my experience :)2) It's much heavier than the D5000 and you will notice it after carrying it around all day long (especially when you add a telephoto lens).3) No swivel screen.  Not really a big minus for me, I can only remember it being useful one or two times.  There's a reason that the D3 line doesn't have it: if the pros don't need it why should you?4) My previous SD Cards wouldn't work with this camera because it uses compact flash.  Not a big deal but it would be nice if Nikon stuck to a standard card across their lineup.5) No video.  Not something I use anyway but you might expect it since the Cannon 5D MkII has it.  The D5000 has 720p video (no video auto-focus like the D7000 though).6) Uh... it didn't come with a kit lens! =D  (yes I know you can get combos on Amazon)Pros over the D5000:1) Vastly better viewfinder.  Composing shots is A LOT more comfortable and the viewfinder is significantly brighter.  95% coverage can be irritating from time to time but it's not that noticeable.2) Better high ISO performance up to 6400.  I really like taking photos at night and that is what pushed me to get this camera.  The focusing at night also seems to work a lot more consistently and is ideal for taking indoor photos when it's dark.3) More buttons!  Making changes is much easier and you don't have to dig through menus if you want to change something.  After having an iPhone for a long time I was beginning to see the demise of buttons in consumer electronics but in photography the buttons still make the camera better if you have more of them.  They are intelligently positioned and make your shooting preparation faster.4) More Focus points.  This is especially useful when you are shooting at a big aperture like F1.4.5) Better LCD screen (other DX cameras like the d7000 or d90 have this too)6) Larger size of the camera makes it feel more comfortable in my hands.7) Depth of field preview button can be useful if you want to measure your focal plane.8) FX sensor makes better use of the pro lenses because there is no crop factor.  This also makes the D700 a real bargain when you compare it to the D3 line.Overall I think this camera is great for someone that really wants that FX sensor but doesn't want the bulk and attention you get from the D3 lineup.  If you don't like to take pictures at night you can save yourself a lot of money by sticking to the DX lineup (the new D7000 is almost as good at night and is HALF the price).  Lenses will cost you a lot less and you can get many of the advantages I mentioned in my pros section from the higher end DX bodies (D300s or D7000).Purchasing from Amazon was fine but make sure you ask them to deliver it to where you work (if possible) since they will require a signature.  Sitting around the UPS warehouse while they look for your package is no fun.Oh and forget about waiting for the D700s or the D800.  People were speculating that those should have come out a year ago and so far we haven't seen anything yet.If you want it and can afford it then get it.  The D700s/D800 isn't likely to be that much better based on what I have seen from the D7000.Google: \"Aleksander Ortynski\" to see some of my samples on Flickr.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "D700 Great Pro-Sumer Camera", "Author": "K.

Nikon is known as a pro-grade camera company and it truly shows in the usage of this camera. Whereas other camera's have you fumbling through menu's to get at settings. The Nikon D700 has most right on the top or back as a Hot key. You can change the ISO, Image Quality, Mode, White Balance, Aperture, Shutter, Bracketing, Flash, Speed of the Continuance Shooting, Mirror Lock, Live View, Image Review and timer to name a few items without looking at the menu feature (these are all hot keys). Because of this I feel this is a very easy camera to step up to. I am very happy I purchased this camera and I am sure if you try it you will also. I have posted some images for your review.

Jreissati", "ReviewID": "R2MFF2MZBGAP1V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur photographer; I had a D300 when I first shot with the D700. I was stunned by the quality of the photos in low-light and it wasn't long before I traded in my D300.I will not dwell on the technical specs that are available everywhere on the web, and I will not describe how it feels in my hand nor talk about any other subjective aspect of owning this camera.I am writing this review solely to testify about the superb quality of the photos in low-light conditions. People who read the reviews are potential buyers and I feel they MUST know how great this sensor is. It's not enough to say that \"it goes to 25,600 like the Canon 5d mark II\" without comparing the photos at the same ISO. Any manufacturer can go to 25,600 and produce photos that are just pure noise!I had heard about the D3's high ISO capabilities and thought the D700 was almost as good (being it's smaller brother and having the same sensor) and I was very happy to own it. However, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon an independent \"new website featuring the first database of objective digital camera image quality measurements entirely accessible via the internet\". I was surprised to see that the D700's sensor had beaten its bigger brother's on the Signal-To-Noise ratio scale, and by doing that, IT IS THE BEST SENSOR EVER PRODUCED when it comes to ISO performance according to the website: DxOmark . Some people say that it's due to the sensor size, full frame (35mm) with only 12MP which makes each pixel relatively huge, which allows it to capture more light.I really believe this is very important information for any shopper who is considering the D700 and especially the ones who are often confronted to low-light conditions.October 15, 2009 update:The D3s is out. According to Nikon, it can go to ISO 102,600!! Giving great low-noise results at ISO 12,800, which is a dream for sports photographers: they will be able to freeze the action using a high shutter speed while compensating. I haven't tried it but it obviously beats the D700.

Spot on matrix metering, fast AF, absolutely fantastic high iso low noise performance.I even dropped it hard once or two. And spilled countless water/wine/sugary drinks on top of the body, the last time it had developed a crack near the bottom of the camera, but it still kept going on.If not for the reason that now days every photographer needs to shoot some video, I wouldn't have switched/upgraded.But if you are a photographer looking for great low light performer, a dependable matrix metering system where you don't have a slight worry of under/over expose your shots because of some dumb metering mistakes your camera made for you (like all Canon DSLRs)  This is a MUST buy camera.  Considering how cheap the D700 is now days on the market, it's a no brainier.If you need video function, look for D600 at similar price bracket, with great low noise performance and many upgraded features.Few cons I've figured out after 4 years of use:1. Rubber grip does come lose eventually, replacement cost is around $802. PC Sync socket gets lose easily if you use it on a regular basis.3. Mysterious flash miss fire when a dedicated flash is mounted.  I have to send it back to Nikon for a $100 repair to replace hotshoe.4. Dust accumulates despite \"sensor clean\" mechanism.

Norris", "ReviewID": "R1NW1GU1LPH90F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already own the D300s and just received the D700 this past July. The D700 is a great complimentary camera body to the D300s as they share the same accessories, batteries, and controls, so once you own one, you are likely all set with your needs for the other as well.The D700 is worlds-apart in photo and High-ISO performance from my old D90, but until you hit ISO 3200, there is little difference between the picture quality of the D300s and the D700. However, I can comfortably shoot at ISO 3200 or sometimes even 6400 with the D700 and not feel that I need to explain about the noise levels in photos. (NOT the case with the D300s or D90!)I've shot with the Nikon D3, and find it to be no better than the D700 in terms of picture quality or high-ISO performance. (Though I hear that the D3s is slightly better than both the D3 and the D700...)So I offer the following opinions:If you shoot sports or wildlife photography, don't NEED the 9 frames per second of the D3, (Though if you add the Nikon MB-D10 with the right batteries, you can get close to the D3 with 8 frames per second!) and usually have decent amounts of light, you will likely LOVE the D300s for the added 1.5x of focal length and faster shutter speed of 7 frames per second over the D700 5 frames per second. (My lenses of choice: 18-55mm DX kit lens with VR, 70-300mm VR, 500mm VR f/4, 300mm f/2.8 with 2x TC-20Eiii  or 1.7x TC-17E)If you shoot sports at night or in poor lighting, (ie. gymanstics or basketball) then you will love the high-ISO performance of the D700 so you can keep your shutter speeds higher and \"freeze\" those action shots. (My lenses of choice: 300mm f/2.8, or 70-200 f/2.8)If you photograph events (weddings, parties, etc..) then the D700 is likely the Nikon DSLR camera for you. It's small (for a full-frame DSLR), easy to manuever, and can handle everything from freezing the motion of children at play to groups of people at their most animated moments when you use fast lenses. (My lenses of choice: 24mm f/1.4, 50mm f/1.4, 70-200mm f/2.8, 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 or the 90mm MACRO lens.)If you are photographing portraits then the D700 is still likely the Nikon camera for you unless you are a PAID professional shooting daily for extended periods in which case go for a D3/D3s/D3x. (My lenses of choice: 85mm f/1.4, or 300mm f/2.8)What's great about the D700 is the High-ISO performance, it is relatively (to the D3) small/light, Full-frame FOVWhat's not so great: While peerless in it's class when it was newly released, the D700 specs are no longer \"unmatched\" outside of the Nikon D3 offerings.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow.", "Author": "James S.

Since I enjoy wedding and event photography, I was immediately drawn to Nikon for their superior low-light, high-ISO performance. 5D II aside, there's no competition. Obviously, my first thought was a D90 kit. But after some initial research online I found that it would be in my best interest to make the jump to the Nikon D300. It just so happens that a co-worker of mine owned a D300 and after a few lunch-time outtings with it, I was in love.Having made my decision, I began saving and scouring Amazon on a daily basis and checking Nikon Rumors for price drops and deals. After some time it dawned on me that for the price of a D300 with a kit lens, I could have a D700 body. To me, it made perfect sense to save instead for the D700.

That was the achilles heel of the D300 in my eyes.My three issues with the D700 are (and I can live with all of them):1) It's RAW (NEF) files cannot be read by Lightroom 1.2, (you need version 2) Photoshop CS3 (you need CS4). This is my biggest beef. You would think that the most widely used software in photography would make an effort to honor the most popular new Nikon camera. I personally have no interest in paying for all the software upgrades quite yet. Adobe needs to get with the program!2) The viewfinder doesn't quite present 100%. I think it's 95% of your actual frame so you wind up doing a little more cropping than expected.3) Nikon should have designed this with a higher megapixel count.

In my view, the owner of a D300/D300s should already know which one is the sensible upgrade for him/her. Probably the owner of the D60/40/3000 may also find something useful.----------------------------------A word about video----------------------------------One additional comment: I don't care at all about video. Video is a completely useless feature for me. I only care about stills and this review completely disregards video capabilities and features. So please, keep that in mind for the bits where you will read things like \"better in every aspect\".----------------------------------Foundations of this review----------------------------------I'm a keen amateur photographer. I put a great deal of effort, love, and attention into this craft and I consider myself a photographer -an amateur photographer but a photographer nonetheless. I have extensively used the D700, D7000, D90, D5000, D40, D60 and to a much lesser extent other bodies (Sony, Canon). Thus, I'm basing this review on actual and extensive experience with those cameras and from patient comparisons of same-subject shots taken under same conditions.----------------------------------The reference----------------------------------I will assume that you have a D90. Everything applies for the D5000/D80 owner as well with the logical adjustments----------------------------------------------------------Claim #1: The D700 is better than the D90 in every aspect----------------------------------------------------------This is not a controversial statement for most people. The D700 is better than the D90 in every conceivable aspect, from image quality (IQ) to build quality. There is no question about that. By IQ I mean, better colours, better dynamic range, better post-processing latitude, much lower noise, and higher acuity. The last bit is important. Both the D90 and D700 are 12MP, however, the D700 resolves detail much, much better than the D90. So in effect, you are getting a boost in resolution as well.The biggest difference is -as expected- in the high ISO performance. Nowadays you have several cameras that claim high ISO abilities but one thing is nominal ISO and other quite different the actual high ISO performance. Example: the Sony A450 claims high ISO ability but it completely obliterates anything resembling detail (not just fine detail) as soon as you go above ISO 3200.No need for noise reduction with the D700: trust me, the ISO ability of the D700 is simply amazing. If you know how to use the histogram and if you understand how the information is distributed through the range of highlights and shadows, any noise reduction becomes largely unnecessary. I cannot emphasize this enough: with the correct technique, in a very wide range of shooting situations, there is NO NEED FOR NOISE REDUCTION up to ISO 6400. The only way to get better performance than that is to go with the D3S - period.------------------------------------------------------------Claim #2: The D7000 is NOT better than the D90 in every aspect------------------------------------------------------------Ok, this one is probably raising some eyebrows. This is not a review of the D7000. I will post a review for the D7000 later on but for now let me point to the elephant in the room: for ISO 200-1600 the D90 has less noise than the D7000 -heck, in some cases it has less noise at ISO 3200. No, that is not a typo. No, I'm not drunk. And yes, that contradicts a lot reviews in websites that are trying to push the D7000.Moreover, the D90 has better dynamic range from ISO 200-3200. Yes, it has better dynamic range between that range. And it also captures colours better than the D7000 for that range.The D7000 is better than the D90 when it comes to features and build quality. But as far as IQ goes, the D7000 is not systematically better than the D90.------------------------------------------------------------Claim #3: the D700 is NOT better than the D7000 in every aspect------------------------------------------------------------When it comes to IQ there is one aspect where the D7000 smokes the D700: dynamic range at base ISO. The difference is large, very large, and clearly observable. I put a lot of effort in my landscape photography, and the D7000's dynamic range allows me to capture beautiful scenes in a way the D700 cannot match. However, when you move to scenes with a much more compact dynamic range, the D700 can outperform the D7000. The thing is that I'm interested the scenes with a high dynamic range, and unfortunately, for those situations the D700 is -to put it in a word- crippled.Then there are handling differences in favour of the D7000, but then again, I will tackle those in the D7000 review.-----------------------------------------------------------------Claim #4: the D700 beats the D7000 hands down for low-light shooting-----------------------------------------------------------------The greatest trick Nikon's marketing department ever pulled was convincing the world that the D7000 can compete with the D700 for low light shooting.Lots of people actually believe that. Yet, after thousands of shots I can confidently say that the D700 beats the D7000 hands down when it comes to low-light shooting.Let me clarify this: I'm not talking about post-processed shots in which I have made heavy use of noise reduction software. I use a lot the histogram to guide my exposure and I try to collect as much data as possible from my shots so I can later get properly exposed pictures that also preserve fine detail. I absolutely hate those flickr-style pictures where noise reduction has been pushed so far that even a monkey using watercolours would deliver more detail.The good old D700 can deliver simply outstanding combination of detail and low-noise at high ISO (1600, 3200, 6400). The colours, acuity, detail, and lack of noise the D700 can attain are simply out of reach for the D7000.----------------------------------------------------------Claim #5: the D7000 is not that far behind from the D700(but it is behind it nonetheless)----------------------------------------------------------Having said that (see claim #4), I have to point out that the high ISO abilities of the D7000 are respectable. It is actually possible to get very decent performance at ISO 3200 and -under very favourable conditions- even at ISO 6400. Still, the D7000 is simply no match for the D700.----------------------------------------------------------Claim #6 (economics): the D700 may not be the best VfM(value for money)----------------------------------------------------------For low-light shooting the D700 has a clear advantage of at least 1EV over the D7000, but it costs about 130% more. It's up to you to decide how much you are willing to pay for the extra performance. In my mind things are easy: if you are a professional interested in low-light performance there is no question; if you are a keen amateur it comes down to how much you value that extra performance. What the D7000 has to offer may be good enough for you.----------------------------------------------------------Claim #7 (economics redux): the D700 may be the best VfM(value for money)----------------------------------------------------------Please, note: this does not contradicts claim #6. Why? Because it all depends on how you approach the problem.If you are approaching the problem from \"below\" (i.e., coming from D90, or something like that and you are not making money out of you photography) then claim #6 applies to you.On the other hand, if you are approaching the problem from \"above\" (i.e., you are a pro starting out, or a very enthusiast amateur) then the best performance is the D3s. But the D3s is roughly 100% more expensive delivering something like 1/3EV of extra performance for ISO 200-6400 (Note: I'm basing this appreciation on borrowed samples, not extensive personal tests)----------------------------------------------------------A few things I don't like about the D700.----------------------------------------------------------- the implementation of live view (ergonomics, speed, features) is now officially \"old\" (almost primitive)- the shutter is way too loud (a big, big problem for discrete shooting in religious places and the like)- Even with the Sandisk Extreme 60MB/s performance can be sluggish========================================================Conclusion and recommendation========================================================* The D700 is simply fantastic. If you are coming from the D90 or something like that you will be very happy.* For some -aspiring pros, true (amateur) photographers - the D700 is the best value for money* For the casual amateur, or people making less than 8,000 shots a year, the D700 is an overkill* As of now (September 2011) the D300s replacement shouldn't be far in the horizon. Having seen the D7000 performance, I'm hopeful that Nikon will come up with something very, very attractive at a very, very competitive price. If you are not keen on wide angles, then I see the D300s replacement as something like a dream come true regarding dynamic range and low-noise.* If you are keen on wide angles and low-light shooting, probably now the best thing is waiting: once the D700 and D300s replacements appear, it would be possible to get a second-hand D700 for very little money - that is, you will get incredible value for money.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera but beware of FX lenses", "Author": "D.

I've owned D300 for 2 years and I thought D300 was the most amazing and perfect camera in the world.  However, I kept wondering re: D700 and I know several people that swear by it.  I sold my D300, D80 and Canon 30D with a bunch of lenses, and purchased D700 and D40 (for backup.)I've had D700 for a month.  The learning curve from D300 is almost zero, if you know how to use D300 this is almost the same.The question is was it worth to upgrade from already-amazing D300.  It depends.My D300 was an amazing piece of machinery.  I've been very happy with high iso photos of D300.  I've taken very good photos in low light with it up to ISO5000 and above.  So in general I was satisfied with its high iso performance.  The lenses for DX are plenty and are easy to find.  I had an amazing Sigma 17-70 2.8-4.5 which is super sharp.  There is no equivalent in length and price FX lens.  Tamron 17-50 2.8 is another affordable DX lens.  In FX you have to go to Tamron 28-75 and  17-50 for DX is wider.  There are more affordable choices in DX land than there are in FX land.D700 has even better high iso, slightly larger viewfinder (I expected a larger difference between that viewfinder and that on D300).  And FX of course means that my 180mm 2.8 Nikkor is 180mm, not 270mm and I don't have to walk back 100 feet to take a portrait shot.Bottom line both D700 and D300 are great cameras, and you should be happy with either.  For the price of D700 body you can get a used copy of D300/D300s with Nikkor 17-55 F/2.8 which should be something to consider.  If you can afford FX lenses then do research on FX lenses first and see if there are lenses available in the range you will be shooting....P.S.  After using this camera for close to a year, I think it is amazing.

The Canon had some features I liked, but I was disappointed in the focusing performance.  After considering all options, I selected the D700 for two reasons: 1.  I suspected that the focusing performance would be good.  2.  I was intrigued by the high ISO performance.Results: 1.  Focusing is INCREDIBLE.  2.  Up to ISO 3200, you really cannot tell that the ISO is high.  Sure, there is some increase in noise, but it is very minor.  3.  The smoothness of images, specifically in the gradation of color is mind-boggling.  Down at the pixel-peeping level, the pictures have a quality that is just not matched by the Canon.OK, so why did I give this 4 stars instead of 5?1.  Highlights.  My experience with the Canon for all these years is that I can just point the camera, shoot the picture, and expect that I got usable exposure.  Not true with the Nikon.  The Matrix metering almost always gets it wrong.  There is usually a blown highlight in the picture somewhere.  Now, the pictures translate directly to JPG (I shoot in RAW) with less work than those on the Canon, but if I want to do something else (like HDR), the pictures are unusable.  The result is that now, I always have to check the highlights.  So: Blown Highlights.2.  Battery life.  OK, I was spoiled.  I have the habit of just leaving the Canon on.  Period.  I can set the camera down, come back a year later and the battery will still give me 200 or so shots.  I just never worried about battery life.  On the D700, if you don't turn it off when you are done, it will run down the battery.  On the other hand, I recently went on a surf shoot with the D700 in Hawaii, shot 2700 shots in about half an hour, and the battery didn't even blink.  I'm pretty sure the 20d couldn't do that.3.  Recently, I've shot some time-lapse movies using the Nikon and the Canon.  These movies spanned several days.  The Canon can meter and get reliable exposure at a lower light levels than the Nikon.  No contest.  I wonder what the point is of having good high-ISO performance when the meter can't reliably calculate the exposure times at low EV.Summary:  The focus performance is to die for.  That alone makes this camera a must buy.  Of course some of the other Nikons are probably also good.  I've heard that Canon has improved.

At the time, neither were available so I got on a waiting list (not with Amazon) for both cameras.  I also got on the waiting list for the new Nikon D800 and D800E.  I'd owned a Nikon D80 for 5 years and was happy with it but I wanted the potential to make better photographs.  Since the D700 was significantly more expensive than the D7000 and I knew that I'd have to buy new FX lenses, the D700 was going to be a major investment and I'm not a professional so I can't write off photo equipment as a business expense.I was notified by the other camera shop that the D7000 was available and was about to purchase it when the same store told me that they also had a D700 available.  I made the leap and bought the D700 with the Nikon 24-70mm f2.8 lens and a Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S Nikkor Zoom Lens For Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.The purchases were made just in time for a 5-week cross-country trip that included at least 10 National Parks and Monuments.  A few months later, I became a grandfather for the first time and I'm the baby's primary photographer.  I've taken almost 7,000 photos of the baby and almost 10,000 photos, total, with the D700 in less than one year.  The D700 and these lens never let me down and often amaze me with the quality of the photos that I can create.Someday, I'll buy another Nikon FX camera like the Nikon D600 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) or Nikon D800 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)/Nikon D800E 36.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), mainly to be able to have lenses on two cameras at the same time when I'm shooting outdoors.

I saved $500 on the original price and paid around $2200 brand new because they had $500 off. I was debating, should I spend the extra on a D800 and put up with huge image files? I researched and found many complaints about the D800 ranging from blurry photos to back-focusing issues to some folks claiming you needed to always use a tripod to get sharp photos. Who knows, but the 12 MP is plenty big enough for me and I was stepping up from my D90. Why buy 4 year old technology? Because this camera is a classic. Every site I checked it had a five star rating. The pictures are perfect. It is like the perfect balance between megapixel size and Image Quality.Nikon is supposed to (according to rumor) release a budget D600 full frame. I was thinking of waiting for this, but by the time it is available to the masses (and not out of stock everywhere) and Nikon has the bugs fixed, it will be a year or two. That's why I didn't wait. In two years I can upgrade again if I want. I have a feeling the D700, while not having more megapixels than a newly released D600, will outweigh some of the features such as control placement, all weather sealing, metal body, etc. Time will tell.My verdict? This camera is perfect in every way. I wouldn't change anything on it. It may be nice to add more megapixels to make it 16MB. But 12 is still good to me. I normally try not to crop much if any, and fill the frame with my subject or frame it correctly. My main reason for upgrading was because of the low-light performance, the ruggedness and weather sealing, the depth-of-field and great creamy backgrounds, and it just has that \"look\" to the photos. I love one reviewer's title \"God's Camera\" . Amen to that!D700 PROS:- Full Frame FX!! Non-cropped sensor!- Weather Sealed- Metal, rugged- Control placement- 12 Megapixel- 5 shots per second continuous burst, up to 8 with grip and correct battery.- Built-in motor (will the D600 have a motor?)D700 CONS:- 12 Megapixel- reports of hot shoe tabs becoming \"loose\" and bent from flash use. Flash becomes loose and loses contact. Haven't used it enough to experience that.- \"old technology\"- Compact Flash and 1 slot- HeavyI have prepared and bought some FX lenses that work with my D700. I use these lenses and highly recommend them:- Nikon 80-200mm f/2.8D ED AF Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras- Tamron SP 24-70mm Di VC USD Nikon Mount AFA007N-700- Nikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR FX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras- Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 SP Di VC USD XLD for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasThese lenses work if you can find them cheap, or purchase the alternative I list with them. I will probably will eventually upgrade:- Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 Pro DX Digital Zoom Lens - Nikon (although DX, 15-16mm works great without vignetting) I would get the FX Tokina AT-X 16-28mm f/2.8 Pro FX Lens for Nikon.- Tamron AF 90mm f/2.8 Di SP AF/MF 1:1 Macro Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras for macros and portraits. (If I did this again I would aim for the Nikon 85mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras).If you are on the fence, do your due diligence and then buy it! You can't go wrong. And with Nikon releasing more DSLR's, maybe the D700 will go down in price if it's still available. Maybe it will be hard to find. Maybe it will increase in price if the rumored D600 budget proves to be troublesome ;-). I know I am happy and won't give it up until they pry my cold dead fingers from it. Or Nikon releases something exactly comparable but better (D700X anyone?) for the same price or cheaper.If Dennis Hopper (as Frank Booth in Blue Velvet) was still alive and using this camera, he would think it was even better than drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon!I have included my Flickr url to a set of photos taken with the D700 for your viewing.

I came from a D5000 that I still own and use some.  I mainly bought the D700 to launch my wedding and portrait photography business and so glad that I did.  The camera truly amazes me in how much information is kept in the RAW files especially in the shadows and highlights.  Add a good post processing photo editor like LR3 or CS5 and you have so much forgiveness and leeway its almost laughable.I had a hard time deciding between the Canon 5D Mark II and the D700 as I've seen some jaw dropping results with the 5DMKII.  I think I'd probably been happy with either camera to tell you the truth but I have to say that ISO and picture quality was my top priority and the D700 delivers.  12mp seems has been more than fine for what I do but there's times I wish I had the 21mp of Canon's for cropping purposes.  I personally am not a heavy cropper but its nice to have that extra horsepower in case you need it.With that said, you do sacrifice some for that high pixel count.  Like fps shot burst (3.9fps vs 8fps with grip on D700), huge time consuming RAW files with canon due to the high pixel count, limited ISO performance, lesser build quality and sealing, ancient auto focus technology with 9 points vs fast accurate 59 point AF on D700.  One thing the 5DMKII does do well is picture quality and how it renders colors.  Canon is more saturated and eye candy and Nikon is more neutral and gray.  This is nothing that post processing can't take care of though.All in all I'm very pleased! If your on the fence if you should wait it out till the new cameras come out my advice to you is if the price is right (which at this time its not due to the Japan earthquake) I would get this D700 now......it will be a legendary and classic camera.  Also remember glass/lenses is your best investment bar none.  Buy the best glass you can afford.

The D3x is an excellent camera but it's also a beast to carry. I've compared the Nikon D700 to other brands. The ease of use, menu button locations and quick response are what sold me. This is my first full frame DSLR and I'm loving every minute that i get to shoot with it. I suggest you take a look at this site before you make this purchase.

Tucker", "ReviewID": "R2PRM669FW0620", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is directed to the serious or advanced amateur who may have sold an occasional shot or had work published in various media from time to time, but doesn't make a living from photography. I\"ve been a Nikon user, both lenses and camera bodies, since 1954.  Almost all of that time was spent with film as I waited for the digital results to come close to the kodachrome, etc quality I wanted. After learning a little about digital on a NIkon 8700, I purchased a D200, but as a film shooter found it's limitations somewhat unsatisfactory. Also, with a large collection of prime AIS lenses, the 1.5 crop factor was annoying.The ability to upgrade to the full frame format (FX) opens up a whole new range of capability to enhance results especially for an old film shooter . If one has an extensive array of prime lenses predating AF days, the camera provides a helpful assist to focusing if one follows a few simple steps in programming. Also, FX allows one to exploit the full range of that prime lens inventory  as well as many currant ones. While I continue to use a D200 for certain applications with a DX lens, the D700 is the customary carry.In film days for work involving heavy street or crowd activity accompanied with selected close ups as well as some architecture, I usually carried two film camera bodies with zooms mounted to cover the desired focal lengths. (By architecture, I'm referring to the ability to capture at 200mm intimate details of things like France's gothic cathedrals as well as one's overall views with the 35 to 50mm range (perhaps with a prime,) for example.) Today, for comparable coverage of these applications, I wonder if the new 28-300mm VR Nikon eliminates the need for a second D700  carrying the marvelous new 16-35mm for those special close details. I'm ignoring the overlap for purposes of conversation. Perhaps other shooters have some insight on this challenge.To keep a new D700 price in prospective, think what you would have paid for an F3HP in the early 80's in today's dollars. Even though rumors are swirling about introduction of an alleged D800 by late summer or early fall of 2011, the pleasure of FX results shouldn't be delayed if one's main interest is the rewards from still photography.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding", "Author": "J.

So just some picky observations based on a few weeks use:1. I compared photos from the D700 at ISO 1600 with the same shot from my DX D60 (jpegs only) - and looking at fine detail, the image is much smoother and the noise much less, just as one would hope. Compared to high-end pocket cameras with the same pixel count, much superior contrast and dynamic range.2. Nice understandable manual, which is not always true with Japanese cameras.3. I experimented with using a DX lens, specifically my Nikon 10-24mm zoom, even though theoretically this should vignette badly on this FX camera. To my delight, it does work, not over the whole zoom range, but reasonably well from about 18-24 mm. This means I do not have to go out and buy an expensive FX wide angle zoom if I only use it occasionally. I also tried to see if these results could be improved by using a new tool in the D700 called Vignette Control which compensates for lenses (typically wide angle lenses at full aperture) whose brightness falls off in the corners. Although the D700 manual says Vignette Control is not effective with DX lenses, this seems to mean when DX lenses are used in the default DX Crop mode, which uses only the central portion. If DX Crop is turned off so the DX lens is used over the full FX field, Vignette Control does indeed improve the results in some cases. It's subtle and inconsistent and dependent on the other settings, in particular Active D-Lighting, so be sure to try it first. But the bottom line is that you may already have your 20mm lens from your DX collection, a big cost saving.4. A minor complaint. The only remote wireless shutter release which works with this camera is an expensive radio setup which plugs into the electrical connector and then has a transmitter and receiver, way too complicated and overkill for occasional use. I wish they had enabled the D700 to support the $15 ML-L3 infrared remote which is used in their consumer DSLR's such as D60. A cheap and handy way to set off the shutter remotely is important for nature photo, portraits, even self-portaits.5. The multi-selector control on the back is annoyingly vague and does not give a sufficiently positive switching action. I often have to press twice. This is not just my individual sample - they are all like that. Nikon, please, a better quality switch!6. Finally, in spite of the 51-point exposure control sensor, I have had trouble capturing proper exposures in high contrast situations such as a flower backlit by bright sunlight against a dark background. The highlights tend to get blown out. Many pocket cameras such as Canons let you watch the LCD and adjust the exposure compensation in real time until it looks right. Although the D700 has a Live View mode where you can pop the mirror up and watch the image on the LCD, it does NOT show the compensation in real time. The compensation is only applied at the time of capture. Disappointing. Maybe they will fix this in a later firmware upgrade?Summary: Love this camera.

I wanted to review the Nikon D700 because I feel it's worth it.My experience with Nikon has been the D70 and D90, both of which are fine camera's. I still have the D90 and wanted to make the move to FX and a \"pro\" body as my primary camera. I was on the fence as to whether I really needed the FX sensor so my basic decision was between the D700 and the D300s. I've read many reviews on both the D700 and earlier model D300 and know both are great camera's to own and use. My concern was if the additional cost of the D700 and it's specific features were enough to make the choice between it and the D300s.To make a quick statement. If you're considering getting the D90, stop and take a look at the D300s. The build and control layout is almost identical between the D700 and D300s for me to now know that the D300s is well worth the extra over the D90. Just keep it in mind if you happen to be reading this review and are considering either the D90 or D300s.I'm impressed at how the D700 feels in your hand. Coming from a D70 to the D90 in a way, in the feel department was a step back. The D70 had a more solid feel than the D90. Now going from the D90 to the D700, WOW!! What a huge difference. The weight, solid feel, control feel, all are top notch on the D700 (and assuming the D300s as well). Take for instance the control wheels. On the D90 they are made of hard plastic. On the D700, they may still be hard plastic but they have a rubber coating/feel to them which feels more solid.Pair the D700 with the MB-D10 and you have a winning combo!. You can take a look at the \"after market\" battery grips but I'm telling you, the official Nikon MB-D10 is solid. I have the MB-D80 on the D90 and it's all plastic. The MB-D10 is a core of metal, and you can feel the difference. I know the MB-D10 is more expensive but this is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for...\".So in conclusion, if you want a solid camera body, consider either the D700 or the D300s. If you're on the fence between the D90 and the D300s, go for the D300s. It's worth the extra cash. If you can't decide between the D700 and the D300s, then consider the need for the FX sensor with it's low light capabilities.

Recently, I've done a car shoot and some night street photography during SXSW here in Austin with some amazing results.With the money I've saved (vs. getting a D800), I've been able to add other photography gear like a studio strobe, lighting modifiers, and the AWESOME Nikon 85mm f/1.8 AFS.I'd eventually like to add a D3S or D800E as a primary (and keep the D700 for a backup camera) in 8-12 months.For those considering the D600 and D700: if you're a hobbyist, the D600 will probably meet 99% of your needs.  It's got a great 24MP sensor, improved high ISO capability, smaller body, dual card slots, movie mode, etc.  Basically a mid-range DSLR camera with all the features one would expect in 2012/2013. I can't speak to the quality issues regarding oil spots on the sensor, but on paper, the D600 is a great full frame camera for the money.  Pro's may consider one as a backup body.Where the D700 trumps it is in ergonomics, weather sealing, and autofocus.  If any of those matter, then the D700 is still a very strong contender.Original review: I won't get into the specs, but give my take on how this camera holds up being a generation older than the current competition.At current used prices it matches up very closely to the new Nikon full frame kid on the block-- D600, although the ergonomics and features of the D700 are closer to the the D800.The D700's lineage is from the mighty D3 so you're getting essentially the same camera in a smaller body.  Slap on the optional hand grip and you can fire away at 8 FPS. The sensor and processor don't quite match up today's semipro DSLRs, but it is still VERY GOOD.  Unless you're always shooting in the dark with no flash, images are clean up to ISO 3200 and still usable at ISO 6400 with the proper exposure and post processing.  I rarely go up to 3200, so that was no big deal to me.The only major omission is the lack of a movie mode, though that really wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Other features you may miss:  No custom modes on the mode dial, single card slot (unlockable), and live view isn't that useful.It's hard not to get caught up with GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome), but you really have to consider that last gen cameras are still capable of producing the same high quality images as any new camera today. Besides, the money saved could be best used for lenses, lighting, and photography lessons.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this full frame body", "Author": "Tin WS \"Tin WS\"", "ReviewID": "RRWZXR3Q97CPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first full frame digital since the 35mm day.

I waited far too long with the fairy tales Amazon kept giving me, and being put on another waiting list somewhere else would have certainly given me more of a distaste, so I opted for the D700. The ONLY reason I purchased it through amazon with Cameta is because I was traveling when I placed the order, otherwise I would have went to Cameta's website. Their customer service was beyond great and I look forward to doing much more business with them in the future.Shame on you Amazon. If you don't have something, don't lie about when it will be in, I would have been willing to wait on the D800 from Amazon had I just been given the truth.

Heck, it can be a professional full-frame DSLR.I stepped down from a Nikon D3 after it was stolen in 2009, and needed a replacement DSLR fast. After comparing the feature set of the D700 with the D3, it was a no-brainer*. The main feature sets that most professionals will use and care about are the same. It contains the same processor, sensor and ISO range as its larger cousin.The differences are fairly minute, such as one CF slot versus two in the D3, which can be an issue if you shoot events or weddings. There is also no microphone, but in the years that I used the D3, I only made audio memos a handful of times. A pen and paper was easier and I could actually remember to look at that versus finding that obscure audio file on the hard drive. It also contains the EN-EL3e battery, which isn't as hefty or long-lasting as the EN-EL4a, but you could always buy additional EL3e batteries. Another issue is the shutter; it is of the cheaper variant on the D700 and the \"click\" is noticeably different and slower. Pack on the optional MB-D10 battery pack and you can boost the FPS to 8 -- nearly matching the base 9 FPS on the D3.I primarily shoot landscapes, architectural details and portraits. There is no noticeable difference in quality or handling of the D700 versus the D3. If you want action, step up to the D3S.

Several main reasons, 1) I love Nikon 14-24 and I stayed with Nikon in order to buy 14-24,  2) I do not really care about the video or high MP but low light performance and fast focus are important, since I do not like tripod even when I carry it, I want the pictures to look like how my eyes see them, so I always do handheld even under very dark conditions; and 3) I do not do post processing except size reduction, and with D700, pictures directly out of the body is perfect. With D700 even at 6400 picture quality is still great. I do not need the extra features with D3S or D3X and used the savings for the Holy Trinity. I also bought the 1.7x teleconverter to extend the range. These are sufficient for most of my need.I had some problem with first product since it had debris behind the mirrow.

Actually, even with the further telephoto reach I can get with the D300, I think I'm better off shooting with the D700 and cropping more.I shoot consistently at 3200, and what I get isn't just acceptable, it's just fine.

In my view, the owner of a D300/D300s should already know which one is the sensible upgrade for him/her. Probably the owner of the D60/40/3000 may also find something useful.----------------------------------A word about video----------------------------------One additional comment: I don't care at all about video. Video is a completely useless feature for me. I only care about stills and this review completely disregards video capabilities and features. So please, keep that in mind for the bits where you will read things like \"better in every aspect\".----------------------------------Foundations of this review----------------------------------I'm a keen amateur photographer. I put a great deal of effort, love, and attention into this craft and I consider myself a photographer -an amateur photographer but a photographer nonetheless. I have extensively used the D700, D7000, D90, D5000, D40, D60 and to a much lesser extent other bodies (Sony, Canon). Thus, I'm basing this review on actual and extensive experience with those cameras and from patient comparisons of same-subject shots taken under same conditions.----------------------------------The reference----------------------------------I will assume that you have a D90. Everything applies for the D5000/D80 owner as well with the logical adjustments----------------------------------------------------------Claim #1: The D700 is better than the D90 in every aspect----------------------------------------------------------This is not a controversial statement for most people. The D700 is better than the D90 in every conceivable aspect, from image quality (IQ) to build quality. There is no question about that. By IQ I mean, better colours, better dynamic range, better post-processing latitude, much lower noise, and higher acuity. The last bit is important. Both the D90 and D7H are 12MP, however, the D7H resolves detail much, much better than the D90. So in effect, you are getting a boost in resolution as well.The biggest difference is -as expected- in the high ISO performance. Nowadays you have several cameras that claim high ISO abilities but one thing is nominal ISO and other quite different the actual high ISO performance. Example: the Sony A450 claims high ISO ability but it completely obliterates anything resembling detail (not just fine detail) as soon as you go above ISO 3200.No need for noise reduction with the D700: trust me, the ISO ability of the D700 is simply amazing. If you know how to use the histogram and if you understand how the information is distributed through the range of highlights and shadows, any noise reduction becomes largely unnecessary. I cannot emphasize this enough: with the correct technique, in a very wide range of shooting situations, there is NO NEED FOR NOISE REDUCTION up to ISO 6400. The only way to get better performance than that is to go with the D3S - period.------------------------------------------------------------Claim #2: The D7K is NOT better than the D90 in every aspect------------------------------------------------------------Ok, this one is probably raising some eyebrows. This is not a review of the D7K. I will post a review for the D7K later on but for now let me point to the elephant in the room: for ISO 200-1600 the D90 has less noise than the D7K -heck, in some cases it has less noise at ISO 3200. No, that is not a typo. No, I'm not drunk. And yes, that contradicts a lot reviews in websites that are trying to push the D7K.Moreover, the D90 has better dynamic range from ISO 200-3200. Yes, it has better dynamic range between that range. And it also captures colours better than the D7K for that range.The D7K is better than the D90 when it comes to features and build quality. But as far as IQ goes, the D7K is not systematically better than the D90.------------------------------------------------------------Claim #3: the D7H is NOT better than the D7K in every aspect------------------------------------------------------------When it comes to IQ there is one aspect where the D7K smokes the D7H: dynamic range at base ISO. The difference is large, very large, and clearly observable. I put a lot of effort in my landscape photography, and the D7K's dynamic range allows me to capture beautiful scenes in a way the D7H cannot match. However, when you move to scenes with a much more compact dynamic range, the D7H can outperform the D7K. The thing is that I'm interested the scenes with a high dynamic range, and unfortunately, for those situations the D7H is -to put it in a word- crippled.Then there are handling differences in favour of the D7K, but then again, I will tackle those in the D7K review.-----------------------------------------------------------------Claim #4: the D7H beats the D7K hands down for low-light shooting-----------------------------------------------------------------The greatest trick Nikon's marketing department ever pulled was convincing the world that the D7K can compete with the D7H for low light shooting.Lots of people actually believe that. Yet, after thousands of shots I can confidently say that the D7H beats the D7K hands down when it comes to low-light shooting.Let me clarify this: I'm not talking about post-processed shots in which I have made heavy use of noise reduction software. I use a lot the histogram to guide my exposure and I try to collect as much data as possible from my shots so I can later get properly exposed pictures that also preserve fine detail. I absolutely hate those flickr-style pictures where noise reduction has been pushed so far that even a monkey using watercolours would deliver more detail.The good old D7H can deliver simply outstanding combination of detail and low-noise at high ISO (1600, 3200, 6400). The colours, acuity, detail, and lack of noise the D7H can attain are simply out of reach for the D7K.----------------------------------------------------------Claim #5: the D7K is not that far behind from the D7H(but it is behind it nonetheless)----------------------------------------------------------Having said that (see claim #4), I have to point out that the high ISO abilities of the D7K are respectable. It is actually possible to get very decent performance at ISO 3200 and -under very favourable conditions- even at ISO6400. Still, the D7K is simply no match for the D7H.----------------------------------------------------------Claim #6 (economics): the D7H may not be the best VfM(value for money)----------------------------------------------------------For low-light shooting the D7H has a clear advantage of at least 1EV over the D7K, but it costs about 130% more. It's up to you to decide how much you are willing to pay for the extra performance. In my mind things are easy: if you are a professional interested in low-light performance there is no question; if you are a keen amateur it comes down to how much you value that extra performance. What the D7K has to offer may be good enough for you.----------------------------------------------------------Claim #7 (economics redux): the D7H may be the best VfM(value for money)----------------------------------------------------------Please, note: this does not contradicts claim #6. Why? Because it all depends on how you approach the problem.If you are approaching the problem from \"below\" (i.e., coming from D90, or something like that and you are not making money out of you photography) then claim #6 applies to you.On the other hand, if you are approaching the problem from \"above\" (i.e., you are a pro starting out, or a very enthusiast amateur) then the best performance is the D3s. But the D3s is roughly 100% more expensive delivering something like 1/3EV of extra performance for ISO 200-6400 (Note: I'm basing this appreciation on borrowed samples, not extensive personal tests)----------------------------------------------------------A few things I don't like about the D7H.----------------------------------------------------------- the implementation of live view (ergonomics, speed, features) is now officially \"old\" (almost primitive)- the shutter is way too loud (a big, big problem for discrete shooting in religious places and the like)- Even with the Sandisk Extreme 60MB/s performance can be sluggish========================================================Conclusion and recommendation========================================================* The D7H is simply fantastic. If you are coming from the D90 or something like that you will be very happy.* For some -aspiring pros, true (amateur) photographers - the D7H is the best value for money* For the casual amateur, or people making less than 8,000 shots a year, the D7H is an overkill* As of now (September 2011) the D300s replacement shouldn't be far in the horizon. Having seen the D7K performance, I'm hopeful that Nikon will come up with something very, very attractive at a very, very competitive price. If you are not keen on wide angles, then I see the D300s replacement as something like a dream come true regarding dynamic range and low-noise.* If you are keen on wide angles and low-light shooting, probably now the best thing is waiting: once the D700 and D300s replacements appear, it would be possible to get a second-hand D7H for very little money - that is, you will get incredible value for money.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon D700", "Author": "Photoguy50", "ReviewID": "R3TXV66GBU35OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had the D700 a little over 3 months and I'm still playing with it and getting used to it.

In fact, this may a good reason to go for a used D700 rather than a new D600/D800 -- the files from the D700 are smaller and more convenient in terms of work flow in Lightroom or Photoshop.There are a significant number of cost-effective Nikon film-era lenses available used which will work on a D700.

Image quality is excellent, accessing features of consequence to a photographer is intuitive. I have used the camera for scenic, still life and portrait photography. Lighting has been daylight, mixed source, low level available light and studio flash. The camera provides lots of photographic latitude, offsets and adjustments are predictable. Digital control genuinely provides all of the looks typically determined by film type and speed. Battery service between charges is long.Auto focus is fast and accurate, auto exposure is the same and manual operation offers precise control over aperture and shutter speed while maintaining auto focus function with manual setting as an alternative. Metering, even with fancier names, offers scene averaging, center weighted and spot capability. Focus emphasis is approximately the same.Within a few days, as an experienced SLR user with a little computer lingo knowledge, I was taking pictures that were better than any I ever took with 35mm film.

Radio signal remote flash triggering systems work just fine in manual mode.Negatives -I don't care for the Nikon editing software or the editing functions that are built into the camera. They are not intuitive and they don't offer a lot of user control over images. There are far better stand alone editing programs.I think Nikon camera bodies and lenses have gotten a little cheesy for the price they command.

I already own an arsenal of Nikkor lenses and a couple older film camera bodies, so this Digital SLR was intended to catch me up on digital photography (light years beyond my Nikon Coolpix 995) and preserve my investment in FX Nikon lenses and accessories.  The camera would be used primarily for headshots (stills) and live action photos.I did a lot of research before I purchased this camera body.  One of my primary resources in Ken Rockwell of KenRockwell.com, who I believe is God's gift to the rest of us who weren't born with a camera in our hands.  By his definition and mine I'm not a pro photographer.  Ken's advice is honest and informed, and he openly shares why he believes something is good/bad or why something is more important than something else.  His reviews are highly educational.  Although Ken preferred another Nikon model over the D700, I understood his reasoning which allowed me to compare the two for myself.  The D700 is a mostly improved version of last year's $5,000 D3 camera, for just $2,500.  A compelling reason by itself.

The D700 tops the DxOmark results in IQ, behind only the D3 (80.5 vs 80.6, but I wonder if that's rounding error :)Probably the best DSLR for low-light shooting.It's a great camera as many have said, except for these minor nits:The directional pad is too \"plasticy\". It would feel more solid and it would be easier to navigate menus and such, if it were made of metal.The built-in-flash is almost useless for continuous shooting without the battery grip -- too slow to recharge. Even the Canon xxD series are able to shoot continuously with their built-in-flash, up to a point. I have a SB-900 but sometimes I'd like to be able to use the built-in flash for spur-of-the moment things.There is a small amount of image reflection in the bottom of the viewfinder (looking down directly at the eyepiece). You can learn to ignore it, and it can be reduced with lens hoods.The kit lens is not worth it, as people have said. I'd go with the 24-70 f/2.8 lens for starters, instead of the 24-120.The viewfinder is only 95% coverage. For composing at 100% coverage, such as in wide-angle shots, you must use live mode.If you don't mind the larger size and weight, you might want to save up for a D3, for faster continuous shooting and 100% viewfinder coverage.

I was so used to shooting with my F100 film camera and collection of Nikon lenses that I was somewhat disappointed when I first bought the D100: Performance, speed and of course the loss of lens range. However, I was pretty pleased with the image quality under most conditions. The full frame pro models were a bit too much of an investment for me then.I got a chance to use both the D200 and D300 and although quite impressed, I still held off buying either even after the price drops for 2 main reasons: Still wasn't full frame and not made in Japan. Yes, I'm one of those who have a thing about stuff made in Japan and for good reason: Far less issues, if any, with equipment manufactured in Japan than elsewhere. Like all my Nikon equipment, film and digital, still going strong with the exception of my 18-200DX lens which I had to exchange due to AF issues (and made in Thailand, I might add.) Don't get me wrong, I think Nikon holds the highest of standards regardless of where their factory is located, but the \"longevity / reliability\" factor increases at their factory in Japan for some reason. (This comes from years of personal experience) I got to the point I was ready to buy a used D2xs.Anyway, when I first got to test drive a D700 a huge sigh of relief came out! FINALLY, a new Nikon that met my needs and wants for under 3 grand. Almost everything about it was perfect for me: Full frame, made in Japan, performance, speed, size, lightweight yet beefy construction. I was ready to buy but due to personal circumstances I had to hold off. Boy was I lucky. The price dropped more than 600 bucks by the end of the year! Thanks Santa!I've had it a couple of weeks now and am very impressed with its performance. I'm most happy about the fact that I can fully use all my D type lenses and the camera's buffer keeps up with my trigger finger. I am also very impressed with the quality at high ISO settings. I have been given a huge amount of freedom not having to always rely on a flash in low light or long zoom ranges without always having to worry about the \"noise\".Just a few of minor gripes, which led me to give it 4 out of 5 stars:The color and contrast quality seems a bit \"soft\" compared to identical shots taken with my D100 using same lens and settings. (I prefer the \"richer\" contrast) I suspect this has to do with the fact that the D100 (and D200) used a CCD sensor chip and all other current cameras use a CMOS chip. Still, the image quality is fantastic and nothing that can't be tweaked in camera preferences or post processing.Another gripe is that my current flash (SB-80DX) won't work in DTTL mode with the D700. Although it works ok in regular Auto mode, the exposures are a touch off when shooting portraits compared to identical shots paired with the D100 and I have to make flash exposure compensations for perfect skin tones. I know my flash is a couple of generations behind, but I figured Nikon would make it recognize the flash and give the option to be compatible to the limit of that flash's generation. Oh well, gotta move forward. Bottom line is, I have to invest in another 3-400 bucks for an equivalent paired flash.Only other small gripe is the rubber flap for the connections is not tight and comes off too easily. The pull lip is along the back edge of the camera and catches on my hand easily. (I put a piece of black gaffers tape over it.) Though the rest of the camera is designed and built tight and solid.All in all, I am extremely happy with the D700! It is so worth the price.

I am a long time Nikon user and while their lenses have become less sturdy over the years, they are still very good glass (at least until after rough handling, then they become less sharp -- this is a departure from the lenses which made Nikon great historically which seemed to be able to withstand much more abuse).  So now that I own three or four good lenses, I'm somewhat married to their bodies.Anyway, this was a fairly big upgrade.  Not cheap, and it is replacing an 8 year old D100 (not a bad camera, but 8-years is pretty old in digital camera years).Why the D700?  In a word \"FX\" or full size sensor, so that the lenses behave as they would on a 35mm camera (vis-a-vis their focal length).  Of the options for Nikon body with FX sensor, this was the cheaper model.Am I happy?  Certainly! I love the camera and it takes wonderful photos.  It is a little heavier than the D100, but it is sturdy and takes superb photos.  Menus are fairly well laid out and powerful.  I've had difficulty dealing with the camera's RAW output (.nef files), but I think it is just a matter of modernizing my software.What's new in the past 8 years?  Wow, a lot more than I would have guessed.  Ask me again in six months (I've only had the body for a month now).  Low light shooting really stands out.

Ive got a great camera\", to the heavy solid build, ergonomics, and pro details you find all over the camera, (not to mention being a very compact, yet hefty full framer), ... coupled with the Nikon 24-70mm 2.8, the shots you take are incredible. It really is for now \"The total package\".I am waiting for the next Bigger thing past the D3X. A beautiful camera, and in a class of its own, but the D700 will hold me over for a very very long time. Its competitor, the Cannon 5D II is a bit sharper in resolving things, and thats because it has double the pixels. Thats about it. Hold an 11x14 side by side and I challenge anyone to pick out which is which.It is just a camera that FEELS like a lot of thought was put into it. The images are tack sharp, its LEAPS better at focusing, colors, and sharpness all around than the D200, a respectable workhorse in its own right, and a substantial improvement over the D300.If I wanted video, Id buy a dedicated HD cam, not use my DSLR. Nikon glass, build, and focusing, along with beautiful styling, ergonomics, and extremely low noise imaging is what drew me to this over the Cannon.Its just a fun fun camera to own, and the only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5, is that I will reserve that 5th one for the D3X.IF you get this camera, get the Nikon grip with it, and put a great piece of glass on it. Dont skimp here. You have a beautiful full frame camera, with insanely sharp images.This camera just makes me wonder if any more megapixels are really actually needed for general photography work.

Sharpness is amazing up to 400 ISO, still good at 800 and acceptable at 1600. I am not too happy at 3200 ISO but then sensor technology has made so much progress that we now expect the moon...Handling is great and I have not bought a battery pack as I don't shoot many vertical pictures, but the ORIGINAL Nikon battery lasts for several hundred shots, depending on zoom and autofocus use.Another small minus is that \"live view\" (enables shooting without looking into the viewfinder) is not so great, but few advanced photographers do that anyway.Buil-in flash is OK, but again any serious photographer would hardly use it at all. I find it useful in emergencies when nothing else is available.Something else I find very useful is the self cleaning sensor. A small mechanism makes the sensor vibrate and shake off any dust. I set it to self clean every time the camera is switched on and I NEVER EVER have to clean the sensor, even during trips to the desert and in windy areas where switching lenses poses a problem. maybe one picture will get some dust but after one or two self cleanings the sensor is perfect again. I have now shot over 50,000 pictures and have yet to clean it once.For underwater photographers: it works super well in an aquatica housing with a Nikkor 17-35mm, you get a great focal range; and with 60mm or 105mm micro.After some two years using this camera, I also bought a D300, which has a small sensor, and find that it is great to use the two together.

I also have the Nikon Macro flash setup R1C1 with an 3rd SB 200 wireless flash unit. This and my D3 doing macro shots make me feel that I can almost do no wrong. My preferred macro lens is the 105mm f2.8 VR micro, this is also well suited for portrait use if you walk the lens a bit.As a walk around camera, with the grip it is actually larger than the D3. I'm a big guy and use the BlackRapid RS DR-1 double strap. This can be used as a single strap as well. With 2 bodies I can have my 70-200 2.8 VR mounted on one and the 105 2.8 or 85mm 1.4D on another body, and just reach for what will work best.The D700 is a real close second to the D3, pics once setup are quite similar, it works well in low-light, and also I am happy to just take a walk with it in auto mode, burst 3 shots with a third step of exposure up or down, or just single shot it and then make corrections in Lightroom 4.1 or Nikon's own Capture NX2.

I really love my D300 and have a Lightroom catalog of almost 50,000 images from the camera, so I was really looking forward to the D700 with the larger, full-size sensor.  I purchased my D700 used and also purchased two FX lenses (16-35 zoom and 24-120 zoom).  Imagine my surprise when I conducted my standard, purely non-scientific test of shooting some HDR images from the rear deck of my house while taking pictures of the same vantage point with my Leica X1.  Due to the heft of the D700 with lens, I placed it on a tripod when shooting a sequence of five HDR images.  In contrast, I took the same HDR images with the X1 essentially handheld, using only a SteadePod.  When processed using PhotoMatix 4 with all default settings and viewed in high magnification on Lightroom (with no further processing), the results between the D700 and the X1 are literally indistinguishable.  Coloration is very similar.  I expected more from a camera that costs more, weighs three times as much and is far slower to use in practice.  Hence my relative disappointment.UPDATE:  Many of my D700 images appear \"washed out\" when viewed in Adobe Lightroom 4, a further disappointment.  After some research and trial and error, I have determined that most of the reason my Lightroom images appear washed out is attributable to the import settings in Lightroom. By default Lightroom uses \"Adobe Standard\" as the camera calibration profile for the D700. Changing that to \"Camera Standard\" (as per a suggestion on Adobe Lightroom Forums) provides a much better image, although IMO still not as good as the X1 Leica. RAW images from the D700 are saved in Nikon's proprietary NEF format and apparently are best processed using Nikon Capture NX software.  I have Capture NX but prefer the Adobe workflow so this is a bit of an issue for me.  I never had an issue importing my D300 files into Lightroom as very high quality images. The Leica X1 saves its RAW files in Adobe's open source DNG format, which I've found easier to work with, as importing them into Lightroom saves a step or two as compared to importing the D700 NEF files into Lightroom.SECOND UPDATE:  I sold the camera for a D800. I was disappointed in this camera for the weight and cost. I think I've just been spoiled by the equal or better quality I've experienced from my Leica digital cameras, which are so much lighter, and especially the M9.

If you need it and can afford it, this is the one to get!Update August 21, 2010Last month I took this camera with me to Venice, Italy.  I was again, amazed at the sharpness and color depth of this camera.  Since my last update, I have purchased the Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8 and the Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 VRII lenses, completing the range from 14 to 200mm.  All three lenses I use now give me truly outstanding results!  Would I want the Nikon D3x??  Yes, but for weddings I would still prefer the D700 because of it's low noise at high ISO settings!  I would reserve the D3X for outdoors during daylight conditions..But for 1/3rd the cost, the D700 is plenty adequate for my purposes!... especially since the largest prints I can make on my printer are 17\" wide.See some of the examples I've shot in the customer images above!", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Thinking Person's Nikon", "Author": "Craig Betteridge", "ReviewID": "R3HYXYQ634OZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a review of the D700 but some suggestions for those with just as much brains as money.  For this group the Nikon D700 has got to be a favorite.Full Frame is worth so very much.  If you've gotten this far in your considerations I do not have to go further.  No half breed or best fit this is a full fledged Nikon.Since you are looking at the 'Body Only' version, I have to also surmise that you to see no need to waste money with a special low end Nikon lens.Through Amazon I purchased the D700, a Nikon 85mm f1.4 lens and the MB-D10 power pack.  Also I should suggest that you consider the MB-D10 configuration that allows for easily recharged 'AA' batteries.  For the batteries, I went for the eight pack of Sanyo Eneloop batteries.  Eneloops are very nice.My configuration tells you know what kind of photography I'm interested in and I guess, what type of person I am.Everything arrived the same day and within a half hour I was out running the D700 through it's paces.  After a few minutes I was taking bracket shots that feed my interest in HDR processing via Photoshop.  So cool, enter the settings and in a little more than a second fire off 3 full frame bracketed exposures!I could have afforded the D3 but chose Nikon's entry for 'The Thinking Persons Nikon.", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bailout cash!", "Author": "Orlando Gonzalez \"Blackhawk Pilot n' shutterbug\"", "ReviewID": "R3KL68OO84UP5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dude, r u kiddin' me? look....go to congress....ask for some bailout money and get this thing.

The shutter for D700 is rated as 150,000 so it means that it's near the end of its lifecycle. The strange thing is that the body looks absolutely new with no signs of usage.UPDATE: Since it's not so relevant already (the camera has been finally discontinued) and Amazon was extremely fast in replacement of the camera with a mint new unit (it was in time for a critical project I had to shoot) and the camera itself is absolutely fantastic I've changed the rating to the one the camera really deserves: 5*. The only slightly annoying issue is the 95% viewfinder coverage you have to take into account when composing a frame. All the rest is just perfect: +2 stops in low light relative to D300, extended dynamic range, large and bright viewfinder, small body, weather sealing, 12 Mpixels are much convenient than 24 or 36 when you are short in time to process pictures and send them fast to a client, etc.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "D700 Place Of Birth", "Author": "M.

If you need speed and sports photography is what you want, then a D3 would be better. What the D700 does not have vs the D3 are these:1. Only one card slot vs 2 in the D3 which is handy when reliability is a must.2. Slower shutter speed, max of 8FPS with vertical grip that you have to buy and and you must realize that if you need to go for speed you may need to buy the EN EL4a batter and cover for the MB-D10 grip. AA's would work but may not last very long. D3 would go for 9-11FPS hence, a must for sports.Advantages includes:1. Lighter because it does not have a built in vertical grip hence maybe good for travel.2. Vibrating dust reducing mirrorThe D700 is pretty much a full frame D300..the rest of the specs are the same and the advantage only is the low noise on higher ISO's that goes with an Fx sensor.

To be fair, I absolutely loved certain aspects of this camera:The usability is fantastic.  You can assign custom functions to many of the buttons to tweak it exactly to your liking.  Nearly every setting is easy to change without taking your eye from the viewfinder.The full-frame sensor makes for excellent high ISO noise performance.  I shot ISO 3200 indoors and got quality of ISO 800 on my old consumer dSLR.Intelligent Auto-ISO let's you choose a minimum limit of shutter speed.  If shutter drops below that, it raises ISO to maintain the limit.  It works in manual mode and with TTL flashes.Unfortunately I believe I got a bad body.  Autofocus seemed to adjust 3-4 times before locking in moderate light on all my lenses.  It happened shooting landscapes with an ultra-wide lens, and portraits indoors.  It happened with third party lenses and Nikon lenses.  Reading various Internet forums I found a number of other people experiencing the problem even with very expensive Nikon lenses.I emailed Nikon support explaining the problem, and their response ignored the possibility of a problem with the body.  They said \"send in the lens and we'll check it out\".I went with the D700 because it was supposed to have superiour AF.  It may indeed, but it was awful in my experience, and I believe that there is a quality control issue with the D700 AF that Nikon is ignoring.I ended up selling the body and going with a Canon 5D Mark II which I am thoroughly enjoying.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good", "Author": "tyler", "ReviewID": "R1V296CLVK4PD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything is very good, the camera is looked brand new, there was only one thing is not very convenient that there is no introduce book and lack of some line.

The chance at a full-frame body with excellent low noise characteristics and top-shelf image quality was something I could hardly wait for.

When they unveiled this new marvel to the world, I was so glad that I did not completely have the $2700 Nikon wanted for the D700.  This 36 megapixel full-frame barn burner in a DSLR body blows my mind.  Throw in broadcast quality HD video for good measure and if Nikon gets the execution right; this will really rock the photographic paradigm in a huge way. The semi-masses now have another tool that can produce images of such resolution and quality that were once only in the realm of medium format rigs and prices that were nothing short of stratospheric.I know that the D800 will be analyzed and dissected by every techno-critic on the planet. However, if it lives up to the promise; the mere $300 price differential over the D700 with be a pittance and Nikon will have essentially given us the Holy Grail in a pretty gold box.The only downside is that I will now have to spend more money to upgrade my computer and editing software to 64bit so I can properly handle the file sizes that I will deal with in creating landscape panaramics from four or five NEF exposures.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "a d3 sensor in a d300 body", "Author": "point & shoot", "ReviewID": "R2L4894HTHDURD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "numerous reviews have been written already about this classic....if you can't afford a d3, get this one instead. if you can't afford d700 get the d300.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comments of newly purchased Nikon D700", "Author": "Robert L.

First of all, I must say that I am a long-time Nikon user. I currently own two film bodies(N90S and F100) and one DSLR (D200). I've used primarily the D200 for the past 3  years. Before that, I collected a lot of \"film\" Nikkors as well as my film bodies, so that was one reason I wanted to go FX. So I'm not a troll or have any axe to grind with Nikon. Generally their products have performed very well for me and when (rarely) I have needed their customer service, it has been good. I love the F100 and if I had time, I think I would still shoot film with it. But this review is about the D700 and unfortunately, the D700 is on its way back to Amazon for a refund. There was  a really bad spot on the sensor (many pixels were affected) that was visible on any image shot at ISO 400 or above. This \"red spot\" was even visible on jpegs on the normal size that opened with NX2 - no magnification. The main reason I am writing this review is to  let prospective buyers know you should thoroughly check out your new camera ASAP after receiving it. Thanks Amazon for you great return policy! This was a BIG investment for me. I have seen images from the D700 and they are really gorgeous but now I wonder how good Nikon's QA/QC is. I'm undecided if I'm going to try another sample as this has created work and anxiety that I don't need. I may stick with my D200 for awhile, as it still works great an produces nice images. I have no idea what the probability of getting a defective Nikon may be, but I sure would like to know the odds. I'm pretty sure that if I would not have been able to return the camera that Nikon would have made some sort of fix under warranty, but that would have been even more hassle and anxiety. Hence the title of this review. Good luck and I hope you get a good sample. I'm sure this would have been five stars if I had gotten a D700 with a good sensor.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poorly Served", "Author": "Michael Hepler Smith \"wtnwsdm\"", "ReviewID": "RIA771MC571VN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nikon d700 \"new\" (though I have my doubts) arrived with all its cutting edge technology, its bells and whistles, its superlative reviews.

So I read the \"Quick-Start\" over and over, searching for the hidden nuance, hoping it would suddenly jump out in front of me and I'd shout, \"Oh for Pete's sake, of course, you have to blow on the flash bulb and tighten the camera strap first before the monitor turns on. How dense can I be?\" But I came to no such epiphany, and so I called the Nikon 800 number and I was told, \"You have a bad camera, Joe,\" and though my name is not Joe, I thanked the man for the bad news.
