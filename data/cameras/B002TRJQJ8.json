{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This Polaroid camera is a beaut!", "Author": "Camera Maven", "ReviewID": "R28S0RTP41YZ3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a pocket-sized camera to replace a larger camera which, I was told, would cost $250 to repair due to a faulty battery pack. Came across this Polaroid i1036, compared it with other similar cameras, and decided that this was a great buy. When received, I put it through all the paces, testing it under all sorts of conditions which had given me problems with previous digital cameras; it passed all the tests. It starts up very speedily; it takes pictures without any delay; the functions are easy to understand; it's hard to believe that such a great camera could be manufactured at this price! I love that I'm able to toss it into my trousers pocket (or even in the pocket of my jacket) and take it with me wherever I go. The only problem I have is that, as a 6 footer, my hands are rather larger, which means that my big fingers have a tendency to miss the \"on\" button; but I can live with that mini-problem. Probably I'll eventually catch on concerning how to turn it on properly. Certainly 10 megapixels are more, more than I'll likely ever need.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poloroid I1036 Digital Camera--Bang For The Buck!", "Author": "Idol Hanz \"Idol Hanz\"", "ReviewID": "R3I5U7QJR7UXCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited too long to replace the old Fuji 1.5 mega pixel camera I bought in Japan in 1999 for $99. The Polaroid I-1036 is far cheaper but it was worth waiting for. It's amazing how far the technology has come in just 10 years and how small, powerful and reliable they can make these things. The Polaroid I1036 is very small but has a lot of power and capability packed into its tiny frame. Its functions are simple and even menu navigation is simple on it. It's controls and indicators are very logically arranged so the average person could operate it without even reading the manual. In auto mode it shines. It quickly adjusts settings and quickly processes the picture so you may take another. All the enhancements and features that have been developed over the last 15 years in digital cameras seem to be there. It will record video with audio and saves it to an SD high capacity card as a .Wmv file, so it `s video format can be uploaded to YouTube or LiveLeak.. I also bought a small Polaroid Zink PoGo printer that connects easily to any camera and prints very good small photos. This Polaroid camera is feature packed, high resolution, takes great videos and seems reliable and rugged. The kind of camera you keep in your car or take with you to record anything worth taking a picture or video of!", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't Forget a Memory Card!", "Author": "Yolanda \"Juice Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R3O64GI20N5QFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is very good, I ordered an additional memory card, had not installed it thinking there was 'some' internal memory...

This digital camera doesn't guzzle battery power and takes great pics. Some of the features are image stabilization, face tracking, smile detection to name a few. I haven't begun to master all the exposure options and other features available, but I'm very pleased with the pics I've taken so far of both people and objects. For example, I photographed quilts. It captured the colors well and did a wonderful job of showing the quilting on closeups. Photos of people have come out well.Users of this camera will need to purchase a memory card separately, but that is a minor expense.I highly recommend this camera for both point and shoot and those who want more features.
