So, you can connect the camera to your computer or charge it via outlet.- 32gb Sony SDHC memory card- additional battery (not Sony)- battery charger (not Sony; comes with European adaptor so it can also be used there, if needed)- card reader- mini tripod- lens/screen cleaning kit- case (mine was not as depicted but better: a black Kodak case that zips shut, hard-molded; with belt clip)The CAMERA:Now, I have only had it for a few hours and I realize that it will take a while longer to actually be familiar with all features and functions, so this is just my first impression.  I am not a photographer but a regular lay person and I certainly have no expertise in cameras whatsoever.  So, please, keep that in mind when reading my humble review. I will update this review later when I have worked with the camera for a while.The design is beautiful, which of course, is subjective.  I have read some reviews in which people expressed not liking the design.  However, I like it... it's very pretty.The BACK looks similar to the previous Cyber-shots. Large 3\" screen - you can adjust in the menu whether you want the display to be standard or HD.  HD uses up more battery life.BACKSIDE buttons top to bottom:- Movie (just push it to start/stop recording movies);- Play (displays pictures and movies - btw you have the option in the menu to choose ONLY images or ONLY movies to be displayed);- Control wheel - in \"play\" mode, you can scroll through your recordings using left and right, up lets you choose between display settings [see below for more info], down lets you adjust the volume, otherwise up enters the display menu, down Image brightness menu, right the flash menu, left the continuous shooting/self timer menu;- Menu (for the menu, you guessed it);- ?/delete button - this is very nice:  It is an in-camera tutorial.  If you push the button in shooting mode, it will open a menu for a shoot/playback guide, an icon guide, troubleshooting, and operation guide.  It also gives you a history of guides and tutorials that you already viewed and an option to enter a keyword to search for a specific help topic.The TOP has three controls:To prevent confusion, \"right\" and \"left\" are used in the sense that you are holding the camera ready to take pictures, so you're facing the back.  So, top buttons and dials from right to left (or outside to inside if you prefer):Control button (I admit I haven't played with it too much yet) gives you different photo settings to optimize your photo quality:- Scene: choose from * more beautiful skin; * soft background; * anti-motion blur (reduced blur in low light without flash); * landscape; * backlight correction (something about correcting shadows); * night portrait; * twilight; * high sensitivity; * food; * pet; * beach; * snow; * fireworks.- Background defocus- Intelligent auto (it automatically chooses the \"best\" settings)- Superior auto (extra sharp images)- Program auto (it says \"auto exposure with adjustable settings\")- Panorama (I admit this is pretty cool!)- Movie mode- 3D still image (well, sweet, I wish I had a TV that can display 3D images)Shutter button, embraced by zoom dial (move left or right to zoom out or in).On/Off button.The RIGHT SIDE of the camera features the USB terminal, which for some reason has a latch to cover it... and it's a pain to open it, it will likely break off in a few weeks, and it won't be a big loss because plugging in the cable is difficult with the cover attached (some dexterity is required).  This is a minor design flaw in my opinion.  Other reviews of the camera show that I am not alone with my grief.Below the USB terminal is the hook for the wrist strap and below that, the instruction manual claims is the WiFi receiver, which is built in and not visible unless you take the camera apart - which I suggest you do not attempt.There is nothing on the left.The BOTTOM has a HDMI port, the tripod receptacle, and the battery compartment.  Personally, I prefer the old design of opening this compartment, which had me just pushing the cover sideways.  Here you have to slide a tiny button into lock or open position.  With the cover open, you have access to the battery and the memory card.Now, I could go into the details of all the buttons and features but this would take forever and a lot of space.  Later, I will probably update this review and add information.  At this time, let me just say that the menu button opens different menus in different modes (it matters whether you are currently taking pictures or displaying pictures). To give some examples: In addition to the functions described above, the camera will let you choose whether you wish you have a date displayed on your photos, you can adjust image/movie brightness, size, quality.  There is face detection, movie or picture formatting. You can have gridlines on your display screen, you can turn digital zoom on or off (a function that I like); you have wind noise and red eye reduction options. You can take a series of very quick images, which comes in handy for sporting events or other action photos because it will give you a series of photos showing a motion.  You can adjust the settings, colors, etc, for your display screen.  You can thankfully turn the flash off, if you desire.Ok that was my broad camera review.The MEMORY CARD:- Well, according to the product description, the memory card allows you to take high resolution photos, HD videos, and to use the continuous shooting feature - all things you might want to do with your camera.  It holds up to 4,800 photos.  It also says it is temperature proof, x-ray proof  (but, oh, the camera is not), and water proof.  You can also download software with it, which lets you recover accidentally deleted files (photos).The EXTRA BATTERY and CHARGER:- It is and does what it says, works fine, comes with a European adaptor - so can be used in Europe (not all countries) and the US.The TRIPOD is tiny - but it works perfectly.  Good little accessory.  Very useful when you want to take auto portraits (one of the many camera functions).The CASE that came with my bundle did not look like the one in the product description.  However, it is a black hard-molded Kodak case with zipper (around three sides) and belt clip.  It is much nicer than I expected.  I had planned on buying a different one but I probably won't now.I haven't used the CARD READER or the CLEANING KIT yet.That's it for now.
