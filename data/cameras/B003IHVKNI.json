Allgeier", "ReviewID": "R2FSX69BBFFDVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Pentax K-x (with the two lenses) is a terrific buy, and the little guy is all I could hope for (I got the white version which is just too cool).  I have old K-mount lenses from my early SLR days, so the K-x value to me is multiplied several fold, a wonderful addition for what is my \"grab camera.\"  (that is, it gets to ride around in the car all the time, superheated summers AND winter).  My main camera is a Canon 5D MkII, but the K-x can actually show Canon a thing or three, and I wish Canon would pay attention.  Anyway, if you're thinking of buying the K-x, and agonizing over whether to spend the money for the next model up the line, forget it; just buy the K-x.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Clone Trooper camera...", "Author": "Rivadeneira Luis \"Luis Rivadeneira\"", "ReviewID": "R2LFR4MDV1Q4H6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter decided for the white version of the K-x and she was right, this camera is incredibly attractive and well made, the chromed line around the camera gives it a touch of class. The menu is full of interesting and useful options, many of them yet to test. We read a lot of professional reviews before purchasing this Pentax, so there are no surprises for me. Already ordered the wireless remote controller for this camera.However, the lens that come in the kit are the very basic models (optically identical to more expensive models). Note that the L in the lens model means Light, not for its weight but because it is intented for light use, therefor the bayonet is plastic instead of metal (like my Canon EF lenses). If you want better lenses (steel bayonet and weather resistant) and are willing to pay the price, look for the absense of the L (DA instead of DAL) and look for WR at the end of the lens model. But that is my only disappointment and I should have investigated a little deeper. Today, 12.4 MP sounds a little obsolete but I don't need more. Great digital SLR camera.UPDATE:Take in mind the size of the picture files (RAW or JPEG) or video files and get a SD card fast enough for your needs. If you want to shot burst mode or take HD video, get a Class 10 card (at least 10MB/sec), if not some of the pictures will not be saved.Battery wise, the lithium batteries that come with the camera last a lot, so I recommend you make a cost analisys to decide which option is better (lithium vs NIMH rechargeable), but consider at least 4 x 2500 mAh batteries, nothing less. Remember rechargeables work in a 1.2 - 1.25 volt range. Regular alkaline will dissapoint you.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice camera; excellent value", "Author": "George Tirebiter \"Shoes for Industry\"", "ReviewID": "R3QTEZ64XFJYFS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera after doing a lot of online research (and returning a Canon G11 P&S;). Build quality is good, the economies taken in production to meet the entry-level price point are generally well chosen, and if you are making the leap from a Pentax film camera to digital, you can use your old lenses (with varying functionality depending on the lens series.) The ability to use NiMH rechargeable AAs rather than expensive proprietary batteries is a nice plus. Only real quibble is that the readout in the viewfinder is a bit hard to see in bright light.Control functions are systematic and easy to learn, a weak point on many digital cameras. Both the kit lenses are a little soft wide open, especially the 18-55, but crisp up nicely with even a little stopping down. My next lenses will hopefully be the 17-70 and a fast 50mm.Recommended, and not just because of its low price.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome camera", "Author": "duckyping", "ReviewID": "RPG77C6LIIDGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great beginner level dslr cameragreat picture qualitytakes good video, tooget some rechargeable AA batteries, as those are the kind that this camera takes...the regular AA batteries will die very very quicklymy only issue with the camera is that it has trouble dealing with 32g SD cards, it has erased a bunch of my pictures b/c of compatibility issues...my fault, not the camera's, i insisted on continuing to try the 32g cards even after i figured out the problem...remember to \"format\" each SD card before you use it in the camera", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, great image quality", "Author": "Carlos Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "RXF1LI7EC156G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR (kind of the audience this camera was targeted to) and I love it. I read a lot of reviews for different cameras and it seems like this one hits a particularly sweet spot as far as quality, price and features go.I knew a very small amount about photography when I first got it and have since then learned a ton more. I found the manual (which is plenty detailed about most features) easy to reference when I had questions about things. The controls are also easy to use and allow you to be quick in changing settings for everything even when in full manual mode. As long as you have a basic understanding of what the settings on any camera mean, it should be easy to find your way around. You can let the camera automate absolutely everything for you or you can take manual control of it all, and just about every combination in between.Appearance wise, I love the white color. It has a very, very subtle metallic glitter to it that makes it not just look like a flat white. The external construction is plastic, but it feels sturdy and light. It's slightly more compact than a lot of DSLRs.In case any camera newbies wonder which lenses you can use - K mount lenses (which have been around for a long time) fit on the camera as is. Some other lenses will fit, sometimes adapters are needed. You can find good deals on older K mount lenses that will work (sometimes manual focus, and sometimes manual aperture control too).The included kit lenses can produce great shots but I just got Pentax's fairly new 35mm prime lens today Pentax 21987 DA 35mm f/2.4 AL Lens for Pentax Digital SLR cameras and wow, it instantly allows for even more crisp, beautiful shots. The camera is definitely more than capable of producing great photos.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Entry-level DSLR for your money.", "Author": "Seth H.", "ReviewID": "R1CXYAMUVBSKJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is probably the best entry-level DSLR you can buy today.  Let's start off with it's amazing price: The K-X is practically a steal for this price.  I say this because usually if you purchase a camera with the amount of features and software that this one has, you'd probably be looking in the higher hundreds.Now, just because this is technically an entry level DSLR doesn't mean that it is weak on taking excellent photos.  The 12.4 mp sensor in this camera still cranks out beautiful, high-quality pictures.  Like I stated before, it has many of the features of higher end cameras, but the body itself is very comfortable to hold and it is also very compact.  So whether you are a beginner photographer or an expert, the K-x is definitely a choice you should consider.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Will never buy another Pentax product in my life.", "Author": "A. Rodriguez \"designer\"", "ReviewID": "R2J7VG63QDD00M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I sent my camera in for repair after maybe 500 shots. Shortly after, I received and email saying that the repair wasn't going to be covered by the warranty. Pentax concluded that I improperly used the batteries (leaving them in the camera for about a month).I contested that something was wrong with the camera when I purchased it - where a fresh set of batteries would last maybe 3 or 4 hours at best and be burning hot when I would replace them.Anyways I talked to someone at Pentax and they said they would talk to the management to see if they would discount the repair. After 3 weeks, I called again - and got the same story, that that they would not even partially cover the repair.It's been a big disappointment... I can't really justify spending another $250 to repair a $500 camera. When it did work, it worked well - got a couple of nice photos out of it.

A tad bit heavy but most D-SLR cameras are. The Electronic Viewfinder is decent, not as good as compared to the Panasonic G10. The colors on pictures taken with this camera is very good. The colors come out very bright and crisp. I am a novice in taking pictures but I experience good pictures with people but excellent pictures taking scenery. This is an all around great camera. Takes great pictures at High ISO so there is no need for flash. If you do need flash, it's super bright. With basic usage, I was using the batteries since I got the camera in late November and they just died on me at the start of February. Very good all around camera.

I was impressed with the overall good reviews on this camera,& it's price (which has gone up since my purchase). My camera has the white body & 200zoom - perfect for sports photos!  I get tons of compliments on its look (which is accented by a black/white damask print camera strap)...of course this is not why I chose this particular camera, but it does get noticed!  As do my photos!  I have received many compliments on my photos, and having 5 kids we use it very often!  The batteries last for longer than I expected; I use rechargeble ones.

If you are already a fan of Pentax camera, you will be in love with K-x.It's even better. The first thing I worried before I bought K-x was whether the paint comes off easy. But, it's still pretty as I first bought. The paint is pretty strong.2) Weight : If it is your second purchase of DSLR, you would be sick of carrying a heavy camera. This is different. Even if you are walking around with K-k with only one hand for all day long, it will nor hurt your wrist. It is very light compared to other DSLR cameras.3) Lens : Every Pentax lens are compatible with even film cameras. I have a Pentax film camera(MX) and 3 manual lenses and I can use all of them for K-x. Once you get used to use manual focus, you will love this benefit because manual lenses are way cheaper than auto digital lenses. You do not have to spend on lenses that much.4) Digital filters : Have no knowledge of Photoshop but want to make your pictures prettier with various effects? You can use a lot of digital filters with this. My favorite is Cross Filter. Everything turns to be beautiful with the filter.5) Batteries : I use Sanyo Enelope 2700mah and I normally take 2~300 pictures without change of batteries. The battery efficiency of K-x is pretty good and you do NOT have to worry about batteries anymore.Most of DSLR cameras use flat batteries which is not easy to buy everywhere, but since K-x uses AA batteries you can buy and use your camera again anywhere. Even if you forget a charger on your trip or to charge batteries, you can buy batteries and take pictures again.6) Durability : I already mentioned how durable the painting of surface is so I will skip this part. But I want to talk about the body itself and LCD screen.I am not a careful girl. I drop things easy. Of course I dropped K-x more than 10 times within a year. Result? It is totally fine still and it does not even have any scratches. It's sturdy. And the LCD screen. I have not used any screen protector but it does not have a single scratch.You will never regret!I love my camera!!!!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!

My main reason was the price and because of what everyone has said about how amazing this camera is.  I don't know half of the features on it yet but from what i've done with it so far i'm very impressed.  It takes beautiful pictures.  I paid $580 for this camera and it came with the white 18-55mm and black 50-200mm lenses.  Most places you look will charge more than that price and you will only get the one lens. I am a total beginner and i don't really have any trouble trying to figure this camera out so it's very user friendly.  It's built great and far better than the equivalent canon and nikon models.

Lots of bang for the buck.  If you are looking for a professional quality camera, you may want to keep looking, but this is definitely the real deal.

Since I am still learning the art of photography, I keep my book with me at all times.  The camera's dashboard is well laid out and easy to use.  This package comes with two lens, the 18-35mm & 50-200mm.  These are great \"starter\" lens.  This really is an amazing deal.  You could pay a couple hundred dollars more and get the k-r, but this will do everything you want.  I have already taken well over a 1,000 photos and am still on my first set of batteries.
