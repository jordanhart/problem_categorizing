The monitor works perfect for this application. It has three inputs (bnc, rca and vga). I'm using the bnc and rca. One thing I don't like about this monitor is  that it does not come with a power supply. You have to supply your own 12V power. But overall it is perfect for my application. I gave this product 5 out of 5 stars because of its functionality.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "used in a custom set-up", "Author": "TTLGhost", "ReviewID": "R6ELVD8GLJ16V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this screen to use in a custom video/audio set-up in a car.  Screen is nice and clear and made for a nice center piece in the trunk area.  Remote isn't real sensitive but not a big deal for what I am using it for.  The cover panel doesnt secure well even with the double sided tape that was provided had to use other methods.

However, i took off 1 star because it does something that took me a while to figure out.If the screen doesnt have a line in (like if the vga cord isn't pluged in) and you turn the screen on, it turns blue.. then it turns off after 5 seconds if there's no picture.. and you'll think that the monitor is off so you go and press the power button (but once you press it once, that means you just turned it off, even though its already off), so you have to press it once again and realize that it'll turn back on.  Its very confusing..this only happens on the 15\" model.. Ive had about 4-5 of these so i know.  but it doesnt do that on the 10\" models which is werid and i have a few of those too.it does come with a wired and wireless remote which is cool.dont not forget to buy the adapter separately.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pyle 15\" in wall monitor", "Author": "james sanderson", "ReviewID": "RNFM1HCF0BUJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this monitor to use with my security cameras in my shop I have a Mac tool box with a hutch on top of it and I mounted the monitor in there right next to my computer screen very nice setup couldnt be more pleased", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "VGA Function Blanks Out", "Author": "Mike Lawler", "ReviewID": "R148WQE0LQT4QH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this unit and the samller sized Plye Unit for use in older DOS based systems (16bit). After trying multiple motherboards, VGA Boards, VGA cables and altering every conceivable BIOS/CMOS settings the unit will display then go blank/black about every two minutes for about 3 seconds then come back. Contacted Plye support who basically told me to return the unit and get another one. There is something not correct with the video chip in these units to be compatable in older systems. I have ordered over 6 of these units with same results. Sometimes I have found the proper combination of motherboard, VGA, cable and settings to get a couple of them to work, however the inconsistency of it working has left me to look for a different unit.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "JUST WHAT I NEEDED!!", "Author": "HECTOR", "ReviewID": "R1U2UDGJCLPW3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "RECEIVED EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, I GOT IT ON TIME!

I used this monitor for a security monitor in my home.One flaw I ran into were the screw holes.  I think they need to be a little more far away from the monitor.  The holes are close to the monitor sides, which does not allow you to screw securely into the wall.  There is not enough wall to screw to.  I had to put wood strips behind the drywall to get a secure tight mount.Second was that the 2 amp slow-blow fuse blew after a day.  I ran to Radio Shack to get a new 2 amp fuse, then found out I had purchased the wrong type of fuse.  After some research online, I found that I needed a \"Slow-Blow\" type of 2 amp fuse.  Pyle's website did not have any useful power information concerning power or fuse size and type.  Pyle should provide spare fuses with the monitor.As far as the way it looks and performs.  It looks great, works great, when the fuse is good.  After figuring out the two above issues, the monitor is good, and like the Flush Mounting.  The two issues above force me to give it a 3 star.  I had to do more work then needed for a brand new product, I shouldn't have to do that.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Frustrating", "Author": "michael potts", "ReviewID": "RQNXNKEPJKYO4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This unit needs a 12 Volt power supply that does not come with it.
