{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Low light issues", "Author": "Lissa Oros", "ReviewID": "R3CA9EBMXSLB6J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a rabid photographer of scenery, wildlife, friends, families and pets.  I take pictures with tripods, while walking, from horseback, from the car, during parties, indoors, outdoors...whenever it strikes me to take a photo.  I would estimate that I take at least 300 photos a month.  I currently have an olympus 740 so I bought the nikon looking to get a little smaller camera with the same zoom capabilities but with image stabilization.  I read the manual to this camera from cover to cover and it has lots of options to tinker with.  I took more than 1000 photos in every situation I could think of and eventually ended up returning the camera because of the medium indoor low light issues.The good:The camera has a NICE brushed metal feel to it.  Looks like it would hold up well and not show scratches easily and feels quite sturdy.It's really comfortable and easy to hold the camera and either telescope the lens or press the shutter without straining your hand.The LCD has great resolution and colors.  Some people don't like that it doesn't have a viewfinder but I hardly use a viewfinder.Rechargable battery (although the initial charging time is something like 8 or 10 hours, the later chargings are less).The lens cap just flips back with an easy touch, no pulling it off and having it dangle and bounce into action shots.The camera worked great for scenery shots during the day.I took some great moonlight shots without the use of a tripod with this camera using some of the many, many features.  My other camera could never take these shots.I liked that there wasn't an external telescoping lens and the lens did all its telescoping inside the cylinder.I was impressed with the shutter speed and zoom capabilities.Image stabilization was awesome in sunlight.What I didn't like:I found that ANY dust on the lens created an orb in the photo and I had to keep cleaning the lens because dust would easily get into the cool snap cover.Low indoor light made for blurry (or sometimes grainy images), even with image stabilization and I had to tinker with a lot of the settings to get half way decent photos and even then they weren't great.If I used a flash in low light, it often whited out people's faces.  My friends thought that the flash was too blinding but I can't speak for this because I didn't see it.  I used tons of settings (much to my friends' frustration) to try to find a good setting and I didn't find one.Direct sunlight caused lots of sunspots (I think because of the lens angle because the same exact shot with my olympus had no sunspot and it was seconds between shots)but you could use polarizing sunglasses over the lens for a super easy fix.The light from the flash doesn't always bounce as one would expect. I'm not sure if it's because of the angle of the turned lens cylinder or what but it the light didn't seem to spread naturally and would end up either too focused or weirdly casted shadows would appear.  Again I'd take the same photo with my olympus which has a different flash placement and the photos would turn out fine.I took some shots of my pets indoors and they didn't like the flashing red light the camera uses for measuring/focus in low light.I had a lot of color issues (mostly a yellowing of the images) under flourescent lights in a lot of low light photos but I could fix them Adobe photoshop.This could have been a bad camera but just in case you buy this and have the same issues, you'll know it's not just you :)", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great optical zoom for a compact; plastic feel to it (though metal in front)", "Author": "Mitchell Malpartida \"some guy\"", "ReviewID": "R22ED63H892D6H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the S10 mainly because it reminded of my much loved Coolpix 990.  The camera body is very light save for the lens which will tip the camera on its side when set facing forward.  The body feels kinda hollow and cheap though it is metal (feels  like plastic on the back).  The LCD is great with nice brightness, actually too bright for my normal viewing pleasure.  What annoys me at the moment is the menu system. It takes a few steps to choose between mode and custom scene settings, compared to my Canon Sd700IS which is very simple to switch modes and make selections.  With some practice Im sure the menus will become second nature.  I simply love the clarity and details I have been getting with this camera.When set to Auto White Balance, it takes maybe a minute or two to calibrate which is not good when you need to whip out the camera and take some quick snaps indoors.  Suggestion is to plan ahead; if you are going to be under any type of artificial lighting change the setting to fit the environment and youll be snapping great pics quickly.  Vibration reduction works without a hitch although I havent tried running and taking pictures at the same time yet.  The portrait modes are really cool and easy for a novice to use.  There is an interesting slideshow mode which will allow you to do some nice Ken Burns effects  (pan and zoom) to the music of your choice.The thing that disappointed me was the lack of a full manual mode which I was really hoping for like my old 990.  To compensate you need to study the various scene modes to get the desired results so experiment and read the manual.A screen protector is a must as your right thumb has a tendancy to touch the LCD.  Id go with a fellowes screen protector as you get more than one per pack unlike some of these other lame companies which only give you one per pack and charge the same price.All in all, despite the body issue (plastic), you get excellent photo quality and 10x  optical zoom in a small body.  (Man-purse necessary to carry as it doesnt fit in pocket)Update: Its soo light on the body side that to me it feels like the whole thing is plastic but its actually just the back where the lcd is and VR/Portrait buttons are.

I really missed the 950.  My wife bought me a Nikon S10 for Christmas and it is a wonderful little camera.  I read somewhere a complaint about no view finder, but when I read this it was about 2:00 pm and clear and sunny here, so I took it out in a Best Buy parking lot and was shocked at how well I could see the LCD screen - no problem whatsoever.  Plus teh LCD was set only on 3 of 5.  Don't let the no-view finder turn you off this camera.  Pictures are great.  It's a great little camera and the swivel is the reason I returned to it after having owned teh Nikon 950.  After having the flexibility of the swivel body, it's hard to go back.  Plus this camera takes better pictures than the Sony 6.0 megapixel Cybershot with Carl Zeiss lens.  A camera that is too small is very difficult to hold steady.

I have had NO issues with image quality in low light, NO issues with dust on the lens, and I hate using a flash anyway so no issues there either.  The VR makes using the flash generally unnecessary.  It fits easily in a jacket pocket, and in my glove compartment.  In summer I guess I'll need a pouch, but that can't be any worse than having it in a shirt pocket.Lugging around a camera bag full of slr and lenses, and a tripod... sure, I'll still do that.  But not every day, like I can with this little gem.  I don't think some of the extras are worth much, pictmotion and voice recording, after a couple of times playing with them, I'll probably never use again.  And the video quality, while okay, isn't going to win any awards.

But then, every gem has at least one flaw.The design -- the articulated body that lets you shoot from a variety of positions -- copies the old Coolpix 950 (which I still have). The theory is great, and you can take super pictures without your public realizing they are being photographed. You can put the camera on the floor, over your head, shoot backwards, sidewards -- and still see that nice, large bright screen. Great idea.And the 10x zoom gives you the equivalent of a 300mm telephoto. Nice and sharp, and the vibration control is nice at that level.The buttons are rather small, but still operable once you get used to them. The operating menu is quirky, but all digital systems seem quirky to me -- complicated, not logical, overwrought. But still manageable, if you study the instructions. Really study hard -- after a year with my D200, I still refer to the manual, regularly. The pocket-sized S10 isn't quite as elaborate as its big brothers, but it takes some study if you do more than point-and-shoot.The bug is that Nikon chose to go without a viewfinder. Which is okay if you're shooting in shade, or indoors. But if you're outdoors and in the sun, forget the digital viewer -- you just can't see it. It is a major fault, in my opinion, although I can still operate in sunlight by guestimating. That is not very practical, however.In essence, I love the S10. It is inobtrusive and I get fine portraits at the weekly company meetings. Candids in the subway, or shopping, or sitting in the shade in the park -- are great. As long as you don't have to get critical in the sunlight.I bet somebody comes up with some sort of shade device for the S10, sooner or later. He who does will likely be a Nikon afficionado.Don (owner of a Coolpix 950, 885, 5700, D70, D200 and a bunch of dusty film Nikons).", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "I like this camera", "Author": "Sally A.

Eblen", "ReviewID": "RNRAG14TG1GHF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the CoolPix 10 long enough now to offer an evaluation.  Taken as a whole, in the right circumstances it is a marvelous little camera.  It offers a technical zoom range superior to my film camera, a Canon EOS with 28-300 mm. lens.  However, the CooplPix has four rather serious deficiencies that I have so far identified:  (1) Outdoors (and indoors in especially bright setting such as a botanical garden atrium) it is difficult-to-impossible to see what you want to photograph in the display/monitor.  (2) The inadequacy of the display/monitor can render the camera all but useless because the camera does not also have a viewfinder.  (3) The camera has an advertised 10x optical zoom. Beyond that it is a digital zoom and the quality of the image deteriorates very rapidly as magnification increases.  At the same time it becomes much more difficult to focus on an object.  (4) There is something wrong with the optics.  If you photograph a beach and ocean scene, for example, and the horizon is in the upper third of the image, you will find that the horizon is markedly curved, rather than flat, even though you are taking in a very small part of the horizon.  In addition, I've found that close-up photography is very difficult because it is sometimes very difficult to attain a sharp focus on the object of photography.", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Debi \"kysmom\"", "ReviewID": "R2B9TER3BH7CNL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It takes a little getting used to but is very similar to any of the movie cameras out now (focusing and tilting).

I could never get close enough and would get a picture of the entire class on stage.  Very happy now!  Close ups of items are wonderful too.  My daughter needed close up pictures of flowers that showed detail for her science project and I was so impressed with what we got!

The camera design allows camera angles that are not possible otherwise, for example: shooting over the heads of a crowd. Image quality is excellent for this type of camera and the zoom functions very well.The defects are minor in nature and what I have found to date are:Navigation is a little clunky, especially for people with larger fingers or women with long finger nails.The lens cap does not have a click stop in an open position. It is very easy to have it appear in photos, when taking photos in a rush.Downloads are slow with USB cable, the best fix is to get a memory card that will plug directly into a computer USB drive so that downloads are not so time consuming.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Vibration Reduction works!", "Author": "Faye", "ReviewID": "R36UMU6DD50SNP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a replacement camera for one that was lost; it came with the new feature Vibration Reduction.

I'm someone who has a hobby of taking concert pictures.  Concerts, for those not familar, have pretty severe lighting.... dark audience and lots of stage lights can make it hard to capture good shots.  Not with this camera! I was beyond impressed with not only the zoom capabilities but with the quality of the pictures!  Anyone who has complained about not being able to capture good shots at concerts obviously has no idea how to work a camera.Not only are zoom shots amazing, but the macro on this is phenomenial!  Plus the clarity on the 2.5 LCD screen is crystal clear!The camera is fairly light weight considering its size.This isnt a fit into your skinny jeans type of camera.  But if you are looking for something more from your point and shoot but dont like the idea of the size of an digital SLR, then this is the way to go.So far the only downside might be the joystick which is taking some getting used to for me, and that this camera runs on an Li-Ion battery, not simply AA, which means having to invest in at least 2 batteries and making sure they are always charged (which seems to take a couple hours to do).

I have to have a camera with me at all times.  Consequently, I want a serious camera I can carry around in my pocket.  That's why I got the S10.  I don't think, at present, it's possible to find anything more capable than the S10 that you can carry around in your pocket.  (By 'pocket,' I mean the hip pocket on a pair of jeans or slacks, the side pocket or inside pocket on a jacket, or even a shirt pocket if it's a big pocket.)Three things make the S10 powerful:1. The swiveling LCD so you can shoot from all heights and angles.  In particular, being able to shoot from waist level is nice.2. The 10X zoom, from moderate wide angle to fairly long telephoto.  It lets you frame nearly anything while standing nearly anywhere.3. The image stabilization, which Nikon calls Vibration Reduction.  Without it, the 10X would be nearly useless at the long end.  I have accidentally turned the VR off once or twice, with horrific results.  Perhaps the other reviewer on this site who complained of blurry pictures had the VR turned off.I take pictures outside, like everyone, and inside in available light, particularly of theatrical performances.  Each type of shooting makes its own demands on a camera, and the S10 always comes through.  You can see some outside shots of Italy here:[...]and some theatrical shots here:[...]As others have noted here, the LCD viewfinder is useless in bright sunlight; you have to shoot and pray.

Please do NOT take this complaint lightly, the flash is brighter than you think (it actually HURTS, I'm talking physical pain here). I actually fear it might have some long term effects, this alone is a deal-breaker for me! It's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at Nikon.Sure, you can turn the flash off. But that only brings me to my other major complaint! The lighting must be almost PERFECT if you want to take a semi-decent picture without the flash.The lens do not respond well to artificial lighting, AT ALL, pictures either come out all grainy (if it's slightly dark) or with huge white patches all over if there's a lot of light in the background.Even when the lighting is almost perfect, you lose a LOT of quality (even when using the highest settings, 6MP).The scene modes didn't help much, I tried everything, all the different modes offer so little difference, very gimicky in my opinion.Even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash, there's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear, why? I have NO clue what so ever. I might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a SLIGHTLY different pose (but still stable), and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear!Must admit though, the swivel design is VERY practical and makes things so much easier.

One of the biggest selling points of this camera for me was the 10x optical zoom.  Most digital point and shoots carry 5x or so, paltry in comparison.  For this level of zoon, you'd probably have to start looking at the nicer digital SLRs.This camera is not the sexiest in terms of aesthetics, it's bulky and wide.  Not something you can easily slide into your pocket.  But its size is what houses the awesome lense, so I can overlook that.Pros: The vibration reduction is good, better than the previous version.  Longer battery life, and it's a rechargeable lithium which is nice.  Manual functions, you can mess around with the ISO all you like (well, within Nikon's options), video option - this is good for if you need/want to make a video in a pinch.  This is a point of contention, but the 170 swivel is great.  Some people really detest it, but I love it.  This feature allows you a mobility you wish you had on all other digitals.  It doesn't hurt that this comes in hand for when you want to take the obligatory friends photo with you in it, you can see how you look in the screen because the lense swings backwards.  And I'm totally going to mention again, the zoom...the level of micro detail you can get with this thing is just amazing.Cons: Design - the lense cover broke off after a few bored flicks too many.  With the video option comes sound, so if you wanted to shoot an American Beauty-like scene, be prepared to hear the traffic, cursing, and barking dogs in the background.  The automatic settings can be iffy, depending on what you're shooting the automatic feature tends to over/under correct.  The price now that it's out of production.

I didn't think it could be beat, but the Coolpix S10 did it!As always, the lens is distortion free and the photos are clear with great color, but this camera takes zoom to the limits in this price and megapixel range. I can zoom in on the ducklings in the pond across the street and, with the Vibration Reduction feature, get a perfectly clear photo that looks like a close up on my computer screen.Last month I was at Salisbury Cathedral in the UK and photographed the Christ medallion at the peak of the West(?) facade. When I put it on my travel Web site, it looked as if I had stood within four feet of it. It just blows my mind!I recommend this great camera to anyone. It's not mini to carry in a pocket, but the swivel lens makes it easy to take photos high, low or backwards. You can even take movies with sound!Only two negative criticisms: There is no viewfinder and so it's difficult to see your subject in bright sunlight and the lens cap is pretty chintzy, but costs $8.50 plus shipping to replace. Other than that, if you want a terrific camera in the $250 price range, this is the one for you.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "V.

However, after using it for 8 months, I am usually disappointed in my photos.  In low light the photos turn out dark. . . in bright light the photo color \"GRAYS\" out.  I can usually \"fix\" my photos using my computer program, but who wants to fix 610 vacation photos?  The Nikon S10 has lots of ways to adjust settings, but so far I haven't figured out what to do just to take a snapshot.My other complaint deals with the 10x zoom.  You can use the zoom to about 5x zoom and it works fine.  However, anything in excess of that turns out fuzzy, even with the vibration reduction mode in place.  And forget trying to zoom on anything moving!  Sports, activities, or just my boys messing around ALWAYS turn out fuzzy (unless I'm lucky).I was much more satisfied using my other son's Sony digital camera.  I just want to take photos (and I want them to be bright, colorful, and NOT fuzzy).  I don't need a gazillion photo modes or settings to adjust.  I do like the large monitor screen but I dislike not having a viewfinder.

As the camera is fairly small, I can simply put in my pocket wherever I go and will not miss good occasion.Only sad point is that now this model is discontinued and there are no such cameras having rotating viewfinder even by other manufacturers.

Both are similar in that they were, and still are, in April 2009, the smallest cameras with a 10x zoom and VGA video. In addition, they had an excellent swivel screen (I love swivel screens) and a very clear and decent sized 2.5 inch LCD screen.The good things about the S10 are:- great zoom.- vibration reduction works well to give clear and colourful photos.- pocketable, if clothes not tight.- video only limited by memory card size, not by some predetermined length- looks good.- reasonable flash.- fixed flip lens cap is neat, no risk of misplacing it.- easy to switch between camera mode and viewing photos taken.- excellent front and back swivel. Everyone always goes \"oh! what an unusual camera!\"- the zoom length, combined with small size (compared with current super zoom cameras) remains unbeatable, and is a reason I still havent bought a prosumer superzoom to replace it.The not so good things about it:- focusing is relatively slow.- no wide angle so group photos often difficult.- menu is a hassle to navigate.- the \"ok\" button, which also serves as a kind of quick link to flash/macro/preset scene functions, is difficult to use.- I still dont know how to use the panoramic photo feature- it's so hard to do, even after reading the manual.- limited functions. Cant set shutter speed or focal length. No fast multishot.- the actual shutter button, aka the \"press to take the photo\" button, is a non descrip rectangle which doesnt really look like the shutter button. The on/off button next to it looks more intuitively like the actual shutter button. The problem with this is that from time to time, when I ask strangers to take a photo for me, they accidentally press the on/off button instead of the shutter button, and turn the camera off.All in all, it's really a 3 star camera, but the 10x zoom is very useful and gives it an extra star, if you accept it's limitations.If Nikon added a faster focus and wider angle, like 28mm, it would enhance the useablility of this camera hugely. If they also included manual shutter speed and focus features, it would put the other prosumer cameras out of business.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Outdoorsman", "Author": "Bert Jones", "ReviewID": "R2T6A0TT63AIHY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I paid too much for this product.

What gives, Amazon?Best feature: the swivel. I would never buy a camera without that.Disappointments:Being a 30-year Nikon user, I had high expectations for this camera. But...First, there is no viewfinder, so that on a bright day it's often impossible to frame a shot because you can't see any image on the digital screen at all. This is a HUGE disadvantage for outdoor photos.Second, I don't pretend to be an expert on cameras, though I've used them on 6 continents. This camera, which I had for about a year, was often disappointing in terms of graininess and colors. I was predisposed to like it (love Nikon), but it just kept not living up to expectations. I don't expect a zoomed picture to be perfect, but it always seemed that no matter how high I set the quality, results typically required way too much fixing in Photoshop. Very time consuming.Too often a batch of shots leaned heavily to one main color or another. For example, I shot a \"roll\" on a boat cruise (lots of water reflection) and ALL the photos, boat deck, other ships on the water, even the cityscape, were almost entirely cyan. Desaturate the cyan, and you had a darn near black & white photo. Someone said I might have had it set for indoor. Doubt it, but in absolute fairness can't stake my life on it. I do know it was on Automatic.Before this camera, I used an early digital Nikon, a dinosaur by today's standards. But it's only problem was speed. And it was twice as big. Otherwise, it took far better pictures than this one, with much less fiddling around to adjust color and quality after the fact.Third: There were some things I thought were problems but I haven't used other digital cameras enough to compare. When the camera was set to shoot repeatedly while the shutter was pressed, only about one in ten shots in that mode wasn't blurry, making this feature of limited benefit. That seems odd, given the stabilization feature. Others have already mentioned spots in the pictures. The lens may look clean, and you may wipe it clean, but you'll sometimes get spots on the pictures in their darker areas--more Photoshop time.Fourth, I realize one cannot drop cameras on sidewalks with impunity... But it was a short fall, from the pocket of the coat I carried at my side. (I once dropped my iPhone from 4 times that distance, leaving a dent in the case, with no harm to the innards.) This relatively minor jarring caused the camera to present an error message when turned on, and it will cost more than $200 to repair it--nearly the cost of the camera (elsewhere on the internet). Given my disappointments over this camera, I will not okay the repair, but purchase a different brand instead... one with a viewfinder, a swivel, and hopefully better photo results.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "better than i expected", "Author": "A.

I felt like they have tried to fit as many features into a (little big) pocket size camera as they could have. And they have succeeded at most of the places.  I did a lot of research on Digi Cams before buying this piece, and finally came up with this model. Earlier I was in a mood to purchase Sony CyberShot sleek ones (T30 or something like that) but then I looked into Nikon and finally choose this one.  10x zoom is really really good in this Cam and the image quality is nice even at the fullest zoom (which is not fine in few Sony models). Normal image quality is also very good. 270 degree lens rotation gives you the freedom of adjusting your shot in a better way and make it perfect. You don need to twist the whole cam, only rotate the lens and you are done. VR (Vibe Reduction) works fine. Battery life is good and, the piece comes with free 512 MB memory which makes you feel not hurry about buying a new card. Shipping is good, I got the product before the expected date which is really appriciable.  The only demerit I've found till the date is its a bit bulky. Its not so handy (thats doesnt mean that you cant carry it). The point is you might feel lazy to carry it at few times.  Why I gave 4* to this product?
