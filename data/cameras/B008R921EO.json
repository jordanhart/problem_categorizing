Trower", "ReviewID": "R19JIPT4RO2KB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best when needing to take fast pictures and easy to use. Having two small children, I cannot get them to wait 3 seconds before the picture focuses and takes a shot. This took the picture the minute I hit the button. It even takes the red out which I always experienced with on the Kodak. If I wanted to remove the red eye on the Kodak, I would have to wait 5 seconds for all the lights to flash before the shot. Then I used Nikon Coolpix thinking it would be better. The Nikon was not great at taking night pictures and the lens always seemed to get jammed. This camera is lighter than the other ones I have had. Great size and easily explains when to use all the different modes. I am not at all into technology and I can easily figure out how to use this camera. My problem if I have to read the manual, it is too complicated. This camera, I haven't picked up the manual yet. PICTURES ARE GREAT!", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "great digital camera", "Author": "phonegirl", "ReviewID": "RXF42SH293RQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased for my 6 year old grand-daughter.  When she was born, she had a stroke which affected her right side.  She loves to take pictures but the buttons are always on the right side and it needs her right index finger to work it.  When we turn the camera upside down, she can work it with her left thumb at the bottom left side.  This camera is very light and easy to work this way.  She loves the camera and has taken so many comical pictures of all of us.  It takes great pictures too.  I also love the type of battery and the charger that comes with the camera.  If she leaves it on,  it is easily charged up.  The priced was so reasonable.  Thanks for the opportunity to purchase this.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lumix DMC-FH4 is a good buy.", "Author": "coachwhy", "ReviewID": "R3KKO1H1L5D1F0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is very simple to operate and  capable of very nice photos.
