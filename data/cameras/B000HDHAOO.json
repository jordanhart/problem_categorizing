The W20 has more features than the W10 I had previously, and this takes even better pictures.  I can pick a mode and take great pictures and video, either on land or under water.  My only recommendation is to get the silicone cover that is available if you are going to use it underwater.  It will keep your fingers from manipulating the lock mechanism that opens the waterproof door to the battery and memory card.  The camera is a great size for those of us with larger hands that have a hard time holding the new smaller cameras, and it is an added benefit that the lens never protrudes from the camera body.  All of the zoom and focus is internal in the camera.  Makes it really easy to slip into a pocket.  I liked this style of camera so much I went and bought another one.

I have three 7 MP cameras and was tired of using disposable underwater cameras. I used this camera for the first time while on a cruise a week ago. I also took my Sony Cyber-shot 7.2 MP as a back up.Land Photos: I was very impressed with the quality and the great zoom feature. Easy to use menu and buttons. Pictures were actually better then my Sony ones due to the better zoom.Underwater: I used it three times during the week under water. I only kept it under for the 30 minutes as stated in the manual for fear of damage. At first it was very hard to see the screen with a mask on, but I finally found the trick is to keep the shutter button pushed 1/2 way so the screen stays on all the time. Buttons very easy to use underwater. Just set it to underwater mode before you go in.My first set of photos were of nothing, but after a few minutes of practice (on my fin) I got great shots of many fish at different depths. Works best in high light, shallow waters, but in the darker Atlantic at about 20 feet, I also got some nice shots.Hint: Try and stay above the rocks/coral and in the best available light to get the best photos.I love this camera and would highly recommend it and did to all who asked.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Jeff Stubbs", "ReviewID": "R251PNVMS09Y6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera over a year ago before deploying to Iraq.

For snapshot stuff like vacations or parties where you don't want to hassle with a big camera, and are willing to sacrifice some quality, a tiny camera like this is great.  Add in the waterproof feature and the great quality videos it shoots, and this thing rocks!  I use it for sailing and skiing and all kinds of outdoor activities, and not having to worry about sand and dust and water is the greatest.  It's not a 'dumbed-down' camera however.  There are lots of sophisticated features that I'd love to see on my expensive cameras, like a detailed histogram that shows blown out and zero-level areas in real time.  You can also just put it in \"green mode\" and point and shoot with reliably good results.  The flash chooses pleasing filled exposures, too.The white balance could use some fine tuning, the dynamic range is not as good as I would like for some outdoor situations, and the microphone gives fairly bad sound quality, but I highly recommend the overall package.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awful Pentax Customer Service not worth even the highest quality camera", "Author": "Rachel Gottlieb \"Rachel\"", "ReviewID": "R2SW1TA4MXCGN1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Pentax Optio W10 this past July because of its waterproof capabilities. I was happy with the camera's performance until, less than a month after purchase, the flash function stopped working. It was over a month until I finally received my camera back from Pentax. The camera was never the same once I got it back. After having the flash repaired, my images always seemed washed out or overexposed. I was hesitant to send the camera in again because I didn't want to be without it for so long. I was forced to send it back when a crack appeared on the LCD screen. The camera had a screen protector on it and was sitting untouched in a protective case when the crack appeared. I can only assume the crack was a result of built-up pressure from the previous repair. I have now been without my camera for 2/3 of the time I have owned it.After another four weeks of waiting, I called about the status of my camera. I was disappointed to learn that the repair would cost me 80% of what I had originally paid for the camera. When I tried talking to the customer service representative about my other options, she responded with utter rudeness. She made no attempt to make me feel that your company supports customer needs. Her supervisor was no better. He treated me not as though I was a customer, but rather like I was a nuisance to him. He was completely disrespectful and condescending. I was absolutely disgusted.I originally bought a Pentax because of its waterproof capabilities. I decided to look past the warnings I recieved from a number of camera experts about Pentax's awful customer service. I was willing to overlook the poor service for a waterproof camera. I was hugely mistaken. I don't care if Pentax offers a waterproof camera that can swim on its own. Good customer service is more important than product features, and I will be purchasing my next camera from a brand with more reputable customer service.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great camera", "Author": "Keith Dunlap", "ReviewID": "R2VH5ZN1W8R18T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax Optio W20 7MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom is a great camera with many features that are only available on a much more expensive camera such as a really close macro mode and image stabilization to name a couple.

The W20 offers the bigger screen, some additional photo options, and better video quality. I love EVERYTHING about this camera and I recommend it to all my friends, family, and acquaintances... BUT - the only downside I have had with the W20 is the noisy video audio. When you zoom in or out, you hear the motor noise being picked up while video recording. I also get this annoying popping noise. The other thing I wish Pentax would have kept was the panorama setting, that was in the W10, but was dropped in the W20. I will be buying the W30 when it comes out later this month. So if you can live with the noisy audio when video recording (which I do by editing all video to music), then you can't go wrong with this camera.

Do note however that zooming or snapping a still while the video is recording does result in noise in the audio or a glitch in the video when the still is snapped.  Not a big deal, but a good thing to know.I took pics in poor flourescent lighting and they came out sharp and clear.  Lots of movies while moving around and the anti-jitter worked well.  The included software lets you easily create movies that intermix sound, video and stills to make a multimedia presentation out of what you got.

It is very small, yet easy to handle with a large screen, waterproofing, high resolution video, etc.  You can read the specs and see what it is capable of doing so I will tell you about my issues with it.  The biggest problem with the camera in my opinion is the lack of clarity on photographs taken over 20 feet or so.  For closeups the camera is *very* crisp but for those faraway landscape photos, the quality is not the same.  I bought the camera for outdoor adventure usage which naturally includes quite a few landscape photos so this aspect has been a dissappointment.  That aside, the only other issue is very poor sound quality on the video (perhaps just an inherent problem with recording sound through waterproofing).Otherwise, the camera performs just as I would like it to do.  It starts up very quickly and is intuitive to use for altering settings like flash, timer, macro, etc.  It's very lightweight and simple to hook up to a computer.  The optical zoom covers a decent range and the auto-exposure metering is fairly good though outside the camera has a tendency to overexpose (easily adjusted though, you can set the camera to \"underexpose\" by 1/3 f-stops and tweak it to your likeness!)Despite its weaknessess, I still would strongly recommend the camera to those who need a waterproof digital", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent every day use camera", "Author": "S.

That being said, this is a great second camera for the beach, swimming pool, indoor water parks, and snow.The Good: I have gotten some amazing and really cool photos of my kids under the water at swimming pools and water parks.  The underwater video feature is also awesome.  I've captured their first attempts at swimming on video from UNDER the water!  I have videos of them swimming toward me and also waving, so I e-mail them to the grandparents and deployed Dad.  I was even able to get shots of a friend who threw his son into the air at a water park (the son is in mid-air).  I've taken pictures and video underwater of my kids swimming in a jacuzzi (the hot temperature doesn't affect it).  I can take the camera to the beach and not worry about the sand getting into it.  I take pictures of sand castles and then wash it off in the ocean water.  No sweat.  Because of its \"toughness,\" I feel comfortable taking it out in the snow.  I don't like to expose my other cameras to cold temperatures.Modes available (I haven't tried most of these):  Auto Picture; Program; Night Scene; Movie; Voice Recording; Landscape; Flower; Portrait; Underwater; Underwater Movie; Blur Reduction; Surf & Snow; Sport; Pet; Frame Composite; Syncrho Sound Record; Kids; Soft; Self-Portrait; Fireworks; Food; Text; Museum; Natural Skin Tone; ReportThe Bad:  Because the camera housing is waterproof, all of the menu selections are on the screen (no dial).  So, to switch from Auto Photo to underwater photo to underwater video, you have to go through the menu program on screen.  Not a big deal--just have to adjust.  The main thing is the lag time of the flash.  Unless you're at an outdoor pool, most photos (in and out of the water) need a flash.  The flash is SLOW, especially the underwater flash. I sometimes have to try 3 or 4 times to get a nice shot--but worth it!  Also, if there are lots of bubbles in the water (wave pool), the focus can get thrown off.The Bottom Line:  This won't likely fit the bill to capture amazing shots and certainly not indoor photos where the target is moving (takes patience and several tries).

Little did I know that it would be in a rainstorm where it would get it's true test. My family's camera's all had issues while it rained, but I clicked pictures away the whole day. I did, however, use the camera underwater a few days later. It can be difficult to take the picture at first, but give yourself a good 10 minutes of play time with it. It can be hard to focus on fish that are really close to the lense, but once you get started, it'll blow you away.There are a couple of things to watch out for. In low light situations, the images turn out blurry. I tried taking pictures at a night time luau that didn't have the brightest stage lights, and the pictures all ended up a blur of motion. Another thing is to remember to switch back and forth when you play around with the modes. If you set it to photo landscapes and forget to switch to portrait to take family shots, it can blur the closer objects (your family, ect). However, it's just as easy to leave it on the auto mode and let the camera pick the best settings for you. But the nice part is, you have options available that I didn't expect for a camera of this price.Otherwise, I LOVE this camera. It's light-weight and fit right in my purse. It's got wonderful clarity, even at distance zoom. I had the images set to maximum quality, and I had about 275 photos on a single gig card. They are big pix at this level, so prepare for them to take up a lot of room on your hard drive. I had friends ask me to email pictures to them, and they were shocked by how clear they were. It also does digital video and records sounds, so I have some great video as well.If you're looking for a great, easy to use camera that can give you near professional results and can stand a little wear & tear, this is the one for you.A little tip: tie a knot in the strap so that you can barely slip your hand thru.

You may get stuck holding the camera for a few seconds in low light situations or your hands may get tired holding the camera, think about getting a monopod.  Amazon has a nice selection.  A monopod will help to stabilize the camera and not drop it as much.  Try not to buy more monopod than you will use, as you will have to carry the thing for miles.  Pro monopods are heavy duty.  Bogen makes a 4 section, light weight monopod for $29.when importing photo files to your computer, be aware that not all monitors will show the file the same as it will print.  My work computer makes the files look fuzzy but my Mac with Lacie monitor displays the files very nice. Search mega pixel on wikipedia for more information.  There are few commercially available monitors that will display 7.7 mega pixels.  To display a 7.7 mega pixel photo file you need a QUXGA (Quad Ultra Extended Graphics Array), such as the Apple 30-inch Cinema HD Display.  Dell 30 inch UltraSharp Widescreen Digital Flat Panel displays up to 4.1 mega pixel.  You should realize that your computer monitor is not going to show the quality of a print.  Take some photos, have the photo files printed, this will give you a much better idea of the quality of photo you have taken.For a point and shoot camera the optio w20 takes great photos.  With a 2 gig sd flash memory card you can take 570 photos (change the camera quality setting to 3 stars, factory set to 2 stars). The Battery will run down after 100 to 200 photos depending on how often the flash is used.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Pentax W20 digital camera", "Author": "Mark D.

I did a side by side comparison, between my 5 year old 4 megapixel Canon and this new 7 mp Pentax.  Indoors with flash. Outdoors. In shade. In auto everything mode. Set to my preferences. No contest. The Pentax lost every time. The colors were muddy. The sharpness was far less than my 4 mp Canon. The flash kept overexposing everything, and washing out colors.It also has no controls for aperture or shutter speed. I'm an old fashioned photographer, having learned on a completely mechanical Pentax from the early '70s.  Idiot-proof programs (sports = faster shutter speed, and 'landscape' = smaller aperture for depth of field, etc.) doesn't impress me.  I tried a couple of them, and they didnt' work that well either.Bottom line: either Pentax really screwed up on the design of this camera. Or, it's defective. Either way, I'm not keeping it.  Poor design, poor quality control. Not much of a choice. Not much to recommend it.  I've read the reviews for the Olympus SW, and it doesn't sound rousing either.
