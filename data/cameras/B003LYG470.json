The color is very true, the night vision range seems to be pretty good and the lighting is even with no flashlight effect.  The resolution is not great at 420 lines but the image is very acceptable.  This camera has the Sharp lens.  I also bought the same camera with a more expensive Sony lens.  I was surprised to find that the camera with the Sharp lens was clearly the better image.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Typical low end CCTV camera.", "Author": "Proaudio55 \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R1XB9N80X9YGD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is your typical low end security camera: Nothing more and nothing less. Let's be realistic, at this price point, you really can't have very high expectations. It works well and the image is as sharp as you can expect for 420 line resolution. The color seems natural & accurate. The sun visor works well to keep the rain / sun mostly out of the lens and the mount is sturdy enough to keep the camera steady.You should be aware that it's a 6mm lens. That's a moderate zoom and wasn't quite what I wanted. Instead of getting a wide shot of my entire front yard, I have a view of the curb side mail box. That was my fault and I should have done some calculating to realize I need a 4mm lens . . . whoops.The reason this is a 4 star instead of 5 is because they didn't include a 12v pigtail. Most camera units include a small adapter to connect the low-voltage cable to the camera's DC 12v plug; the other option is to just throw in a \"wall wart\" power supply. This unit has neither and I was annoyed.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "camera is ok", "Author": "jason", "ReviewID": "R2W4BL84QZ0ODP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "These cameras are very nice and work great but the only problem is that the housing that you mount the camera to the wall rusts out very very quickly.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT ready to use!", "Author": "TerraByte", "ReviewID": "RMXSJOB0J5FEC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a dozen security cameras from four different manufacturers and this is the first camera that didn't come with an extension cable and a power supply. The lack of an extension cable is disappointing. I have extra cable but now I'll have to go out and get BNC connectors to make the extension. If you haven't done this before, be advised that you have to have a special crimping tool to attach the connector to the cable. The leads from the camera are only about 20-inches long, so you'll almost certainly need an extension cable. The lack of a power transformer is infuriating. I can't even test the camera until I spend another $10-$20 for the required 12 V DC transformer, and nowhere is the amperage rating specified. The manual for the camera isn't included. You have to download it from their website. Unfortunately, it won't tell you what kind of power transformer you'll need.
