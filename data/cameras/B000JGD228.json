I then bought this cam along with a 9 CCTV DVR system. Instead of using the default cam, I decided to use this to cover the back door of the house and I was surprised, it's one of the well covered area especially in the evening. It worked well with my 9 CCTV DVR system and there's no uassle in installing it. the prices of the cam is not that cheap but its worth it. I highly recommend this cam.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "would not purchase again", "Author": "Chrome", "ReviewID": "R1630E6H4M6O5P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When mounted on the wall the sensor would not pick up motion to activate the flashing light.
