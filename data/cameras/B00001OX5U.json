{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera for the price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2PCJ9ERSE32RW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The day after I bought the DX-10 I called Fuji and found it was discontinued. How's that for instant obsolescence? I bought the DX-10, my  first digital camera, as a learning tool and it is excellent for that. I  was surprised at the quality of the images yet the chintzy construction of  the camera body, an ugly. 7oz. plastic box. The DX-10 feels like an empty  matchbox compared to a loaded F4, F3 or any lighter Nikon. After I bought  the camera I found it eats batteries, so I bought an Olympus charger and  four nickel-metal hydride batteries. More money. Also, I bought a special  AC adapter, both items a must unless you own a battery factory.  Photographers say \"There are no photographers at Nikon,\" because  even with a new Nikon, you seem to start out with your own modifications.  This DX-10 was like that. I took it out of the box and rigged a neckstrap  to replace the silly wrist cord that holds the DX-10 literally by a thread.  The owner's manual warns not to scratch the lens or rear LCD screen, yet  neither has any kind of protective cap. And a protective carrying case,  like the charger and AC adapter is another extra expense. Speaking of  extras, buy an extra Smart Media card to boost the 2MB card that comes with  the camera. That will only record six images of the highest resolution. I  bought a 16MB card, which bumps that number up to 54. Oh yes, the floppy  disk adapter that let's you download the images from camera to computer?  That's another expense. The DX-10 comes with a cable but it didn't fit my  aging computer. To be fair, all these extra costs are no different from my  experience with 35mm photography. The price of the camera is just the  beginning, just the tip of the beginning. If you've never owned a digital  camera, the DX-10 is a good learning tool. I've learned a lot -- much of it  what to look for next time I buy digital camera.", "Date": "October 26, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent First Digital Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RKMPH2H9YSQTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my DX-10 in May 99.  While it was inexpensive, there have been the usual extra costs: case, extra SmartMedia card etc.  For an intro into digital photography, it has been an excellent purchase.  The camera is more  than just a point and shoot, allowing reasonable control over  picture-taking in the manual mode - probably just enough for a beginner  photographer to begin to master without being overwhelming.", "Date": "November 24, 1999"}, {"Title": "A Fine Little Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9VSQJLZQZ49P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fine little camera, at a surprisingly good price.  My interest is in photographing things for online auctions and taking pictures of our new kittens, and the camera does a great job at that.  It will focus as close as 3.9 inches and give you clear, sharp photos of jewelry,  etc.", "Date": "December 21, 1999"}, {"Title": "Beginner's Delight", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1D0WRGJEOG54R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a fair (~$200) introduction to digital photography and the Fuji DX-10 was it.  Great pictures and a reasonable amount of control for a beginner.  Just enough to make me literate.  I'll be able to use this  camera for several years before I move upscale.  At the time of my purchase  there wasn't a USB option for connecting to my computer.  This was a minor  annoyance as was the scarcity of AC adaptors (available at ritzy camera  stores but typically out-of-stock in my area).  All-in-all, with reasonable  expectations, I found the camera to be excellent.", "Date": "January 8, 2000"}, {"Title": "Camera no longer being sold", "Author": "Betty B. Fulghum \"dressage queen\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZG6ZDRKP1LBK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera and found it to be very easy to use.  It also takes great pictures.  However, I have since found out that this model has been discontinued.  How did I find that out?  My dog chewed the camera to PC cord in half.  Now I can't download my pictures to my computer to save or send them. I can't find the cord anywhere including on the internet.  So now it is a very nice but useless digital camera.  Thanks, Fuji, for thinking of the consumer.  I won't buy another Fuji product.", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "BowerR64 \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R1QCO1J5QKSSTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Man what can i say about this camera? its been one heck of a camera and its been like an energizer bunny for me. Its been threw hell and back and still going string. Despite the rather small amount of mega pixels this camera will hold its own and will still take great pictures for e-bay.I got this camera back in the late 90s, i got it to sell things online and boy did it ever do that. Its been so much fun to own, its made me money that i could of never expected.For years i used this thing in auto mode never really did much with it other then macro and normal auto mode. Recently i decided it was time to bump up in mega pixels i then descovered this camera has some neat manual features i could of been using years ago to get better pictures.When i first got it i thought it was a battery hog but after owning a camera with a motorized lense and autofocus the DX10 is great with batteries. If i had only used rechargables i would of saved a ton of money.This camera is built like a tank, there really isnt one thing on it that can break. Ie dropped it more times then i can cout and its still taking pictures. I finaly gave it to my nephew who is using it as i speak.If you need a cheap camera that takes great pictures for e-bay get this one you wont be disapointed.", "Date": "February 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "I wish they still made them like this.", "Author": "\"sunmech\"", "ReviewID": "R100FVVX2UHUIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife two years ago (1999) and I think she took maybe a dozen pictures with it. The rest of the time I must have put it through about 2,000 pictures, and built several personal websites with it. Originally it was the price that did it ... from Amazon, and back then, it was the only ... digital camera with an LCD screen. It's also small enough to fit in your pocket easily. You can never go wrong with AA batteries, they're always available in a pinch. ALL digicams suck up batteries, my advice is invest in some rechargeables. The LCD updates extremely fast, although the photo itself is on about a 2-second lag from the moment you actually press the shutter button. But at least the photo stays on the LCD until you decide whether to save it or erase it. (which the Toshiba I own doesn't.)The menu is completely intuitive, the controls are simple and iconic, the only thing you can really do wrong is leave the Macro switch on by mistake, and you only discover that when you view them fullsize and discover they're out of focus. Recycle time between pictures is comparatively slow (several long painful seconds) to what's currently out there as well. (end of 2001) Don't get this camera for action shots, because you'll miss them.a 16M SmartMedia card will get you about 50 images in the highest resolution.For webpages, once you shrink the images to fit on a webpage, they're all the same. The difference is negligible.But if you're going to blow them up to print them, it might be a problem in anything bigger than 8x10. 1.6x digital zoom, no focus, but at least those are two things less to worry about. The photos are always in focus anyway.Color-correction modes are a little off color-wise, but that's always been fixable with basic imaging software. (even that's always dependable on your platform, for instance, dark greens seem to register as black on PCs, and vivid green on MACs.)After awhile, dust started to accumulate under the protective plastic lens cover, and the photos became blurry. There was no way to reach it by disassembling the camera to clean it, so I broke the cover off completely. Problem solved. Even though the resolution is under 1M-pixel, photos consistently come out sharp and high quality.This model comes with a video-out jack. Subsequent models such as the MX-1200 don't have it. If you like watching the photos back on your TV or other video source, then get this model.The serial cord to upload them to your computer is horribly slow. (I'm talking about 20+ minutes to load. Seriously.)Get either a USB card reader, ...or a floppy adapter instead and save yourself about 19 minutes of finger-tapping.I just upgraded to a Toshiba PDR-M70, because I need more flexibility, things such as a flash-sync port for my studio flash equipment, and the ability to attach filters. But I wish it had the simplicity menu-wise of the DX-10.", "Date": "November 18, 2001"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1,024 x 768 maximum resolution\n3x digital zoom\nSpecial digital effects\n1/3-inch, 850,000-square-pixel CCD\nMac and Windows compatible", "Name": "Fujifilm DX-10 0.8MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JPRQ1DRJL.gif", "ProductID": "B00001OX5U"}}
