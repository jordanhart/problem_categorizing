The friends I'm traveling with are so impressed with the pictures I've taken and profess me to be a very talented photographer; however, the reality is this camera is so good, it provides everyone with professional results.  The 42X zoom is an amazing feature and so easy to focus, I look forward to using it on my upcoming safari.  The bundle is a great value and includes everything you need to get started although I bought additional batteries (I recommend you always carry a spare one) and a larger memory card.

Setters", "ReviewID": "R2PLSTXX9Z2C7P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think the camera is great but the bundle - not so much. The camera pouch is too small to hold anything more than the camera and the \"large\" tripod is a joke. A max height of fifty (50) inches is not very helpful. Yes it is lightweight which helps when walking around with the camera all day but when playing tourist-o, one tends to want to take photos from vantage points that were built to be vantage points. That usually means that rails were erected to prevent one from falling and guess how tall those rails usually are? Yeah. The charger and cables and memory flash cards are all nice but you really should either drop the tripod or provide one that does not require one to partly squat to use.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap tripod advertised as professional", "Author": "Gabriel", "ReviewID": "R2XOHVGNOK9NU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am happy with everything in the package except the tripodIt was advertised as professional but is very very cheap and flimsyThe rest of the package was very good", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Carl Hansen", "ReviewID": "R18YVGJRTTKWIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome!!

Upon opening the camera box and pulling out the camera, I noticed that when I gently shook the camera there was a rattling noise and a movement.  It felt like the lens was loose in the casing.  Also, I have not ordered a point and shoot camera in awhile, but the last one I ordered was metal, this one is all plastic which gave it a cheap feel.  I contacted Focus Camera where it came from and in order to exchange(which I felt I had to do or send back the whole, huge box and everything that came with it) I had to pay for insurance and postage to ship it back.  They did not offer to help with charges.

It's simple to shoot videos and I love the fact that you can't \"accidentally\" do that (a real problem with a former camera).
