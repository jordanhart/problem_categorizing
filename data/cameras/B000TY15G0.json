{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Inconsistent - does not have LCD screen", "Author": "King Lou", "ReviewID": "RZEO4ECBC6MW3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, the item description is incorrect.  This unit does not have an LCD screen, nor is the screen flat.  It uses a mini projection CRT that projects up at the curved screen surface.  Consequently, there is distortion of the image (stretched on the edges), and definitely not high-res.  Also, the manual claims a larger field of view angle than it actually has.  I'm an engineer and I measured it to be about 40 degrees across the center of the screen.  Consequently, you won't see that much of your visitor and there may be a problem viewing both short and tall visitors.  Well, the item is pretty inexpensive at just $92, so all this might be excusable, but there were also a serious functional problem.  The doorbell button on the camera would not work correctly up to 50% of the time.  I had to return the unit as defective.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Doorbell view", "Author": "joeyp", "ReviewID": "RXTZZC93BMKXW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The picture is good.Installation easy.My complaint is: Someone at your door must push the button for you to see them.I would like to be able to turn the camera on from inside my house.I would like to be able to start the conversation from in the house if they don't push the talk button.

The video will also sometimes turn of when you push the talk button, Push to talk button often won't work, etc.  Very unreliable, don't waste your time like I did!

Works great. easy to install. I wish the camera tilt upward had one more step (I had to use the existing audio-only location for the outdoor module, it's a little too low) but this is my problem, not the device.Not worth the extra $100 to get a color version, this is more than sufficient and half cheaper", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works as expected.", "Author": "G.
