{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Compact, Sturdy, and Takes Beautiful Pictures", "Author": "TOL", "ReviewID": "R3KPDJM4RQFJJ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(...) After looking at the Digital Elphs and the A-series cameras, I stumbled upon the S40. This camera has it all. Four mega-pixels, a sturdy metal body, complete control over almost every aspect of your shot, and all in a compact size to boot. The feature-set is based on the popular Canon G2, which is a professional grade digital camera, so you know it uses a fully field-tested, high-quality internal design.I mostly use this camera in auto mode, in which it takes absolutely beautiful pictures. They are clear, beautifully saturated, and capture motion extremely well. Indoor and outdoor pictures are equally impressive, and I found the metering to be very intelligent. That is, highlights, shadows, and exposure levels are all handled very well.The camera offers an amazing amount of control with 12 user-selectable modes in addition to the auto mode. (...) But, suffice it to say that anyone seeking a high-level of control over their settings will not be dissapointed by the S40.A Little Advice:1. If you are looking to spend a little less money and do not need a 4 mega-pixel camera, a 3 mega-pixel version is available in the S30.2. If you are looking for a point-and-shoot camera only, you do not need to spend this kind of money. Look toward the Canon A-Series cameras instead. These are plastic and lack the high-level of user control, but they are also much easier on the wallet.3. Although this is a very compact camera, it is not the smallest that Canon makes. If you want the ultimate in portability, look at their Digital Elph line.4. The proprietary battery that comes with the S40 is extremely powerful and has an impressive life. The charger is also very compact and very fast. However, I highly recommend buying a spare battery from Canon's website (for about $70).5. Do not waste your money on the leather case for the S40 that Canon sells on their website. It is far too small for the camera and the lens cover slides open whenever you try to put the camera in it. I am not a big fan of sliding lens covers in the first place, and the leather case does nothing to win me over. Go buy yourself a generic camera case that fits the camera properly.6. The included 16 MB CompactFlash card is embarrassing. Go buy a 128 MB card (at minimum). And while you're at it, pick up a USB card reader. They are under $(...) and are far more convenient than using the direct camera hook-up (although the S40 software and connection is quite convenient compared to many other digital cameras).7. Be careful when removing the label from the lens cover. You can actually pull the cover right off if you're not careful. PEEL SLOWLY!Conclusion:Overall, this is a beautifully designed, well-built camera from an excellent company. As you can see by my review, Canon has won me over. In summary, the S40 matches the excellent picture quality of the finest Nikon and Kodak cameras available. The difference is, Canon does not skimp on the build of the camera by using cheap plastic parts. This, in my opinion, puts the S40 above the rest in this category.Well Done Canon!", "Date": "March 1, 2002"}, {"Title": "Quick test - nearly flawless", "Author": "Heike Bruegmann", "ReviewID": "R3HUOGCQO93GZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the camera for only a week now, but already taken it on a trip to California's lost coast.

It's a very sleek little package.  Four megapixels, 3x zoom, auto and manual modes, a fairly long lasting rechargable battery, all in a tiny metal body.  I prefer this over the newer Nikon consumer digicams (the 775 and the 885) because the body is built better, the resolution is higher, and the Canon has manual modes.  I only gave this camera four stars because of a couple reasons:a.  It's visibly less sharp than other cameras in this resolution range.  Not a lot less, but enough to notice.  The color is great, but the pictures aren't quite as sharp as the ones the S40's big brother (the G2) produces.  b.  The macro mode (or should I say lack thereof) isn't very good.  I find it odd that Canon hasn't worked on improving this in their newer model cameras; pretty much all of the Nikons have *excellent* macro modes.  Other than that, it's a sweet little package.  I like the fact that the play-mode button is no longer part of the control dial.  You no longer have to move the camera out of whatever record mode you're currently in to get into the play mode.  The play-mode is controlled by a little standalone switch on the back of the camera.  Slide it across once, you go into play mode, slide it across again, you go into record mode.  Another  positive is the long lasting lithium-ion battery (which has a quick charge time and does not require draining before recharging).  Highly recommended for most users.  If you think you'll be making a lot of large sized prints with the camera (i.e. bigger than 8x10), you might check out the G2 instead.", "Date": "November 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R6PAPM888JRFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera.  I also own the Canon digital Elph camera I love it but I needed something a little more robust for some higher quality digital photography.  The digital Elph is fine for 4x6 photos but I wanted the capability of enlargements and the small Canon was very limiting for me.  The 4 Megapixel resolution is quite remarkable and the photos prints scale very nicely.  I have produced some high quality 8x10 that gave nothing away to my high quality SLR in terms of print quality.  The Canon S40 is packed with feature and I am still exploring them but I can report that the camera is well designed and it gives you very good control to get the shots that you need.  The flash and battery life which were both problems I had to deal with in the digital Elph are not problems here.  I strongly endorse this camera for the people who need enlargements at 8x10 or larger.  I thought just maybe that I could put away my SLR but not yet. On my last trip I took my digital Elph, my Canon S40 and my Minolta SLR.  The Canon S40 was the star of the trip producing some great shots.  My Minolta SLR was the only one I felt comfortable using for some action shots in difficult lighting.  The digital elph was unused until the battery on my S40 ran out and I needed a couple more run of the mill snapshots.  For most photography work you could do just fine replacing your SLR with the S40.  If you purchase this camera you will need to buy a 128MB or higher CF card and an extra battery.

The G2 was for me and the S40 was for my girlfriend.  The reasoning was I thought that the \"Bulky sized\" G2 would be good for the \"serious\" shots and the \"Light\" S40 would be for the \"fun party\" casual pictures.  I was wrong.  First of all the Canon G2 is a fine camera and for the most part takes nice pictures.  Here are the good points of the S40.Size of CameraFirst it is lightweight, easy to hold and easy to put a shirt pocket (but for a short while, if you needed both hands for something else).Picture QualityThe still picture quality is very good to excellent but I still feel that a good 35mm still has a slight edge in quality.  Every once in a while about 1 in 10 one comes out blurry, but if you can with a digital camera you can take it again.  Motion pictures (object is moving) are ok but I have not had a lot of luck with the quality again the good 35mm would win. The video quality is fair to good and at a 30 second time limit we only use it for fun or when our sheep dog a does something silly it just quicker to video tape it on the Camera are email it too friends! That is really nice.Cameras ease of useThis is where the Canon S40 really shines.  This camera is very easy to use it's an almost pick up and use right away.  If your not sure about a button Canon User manuals very user friendly.  To view the picture, just slide the Power/Replay Lever to the right and there you go.  This is a very simple Camera to use it is fro the first time user or the experienced photographer.  The battery life is good, it last for almost a complete dinner party sometimes I wish I had two of them.  I do like that the battery comes out and goes into the mini charger with is easy to take along rather than the bulky one the G2 came with.Print qualityI may write about this later as me printer is old put I have printed an 8 by 10 at a friends house and wow it looks great!RecommendationsGet the largest Compact flash card available i.e. 128 or 256 they are really getting inexpensive. You will be happy you did. Second get a Palm pilot screen protector (cut to size) for the LCD monitor you will be happy when you do. And third get a card reader for picture transer to you PC, they are work the same price is not a factor and if you have Windows XP it will recognize the card reader and install its own software.This is a great Camera all in all I am glad I bought the 4-mega pixel instead of the 3-mega-pixel version.

Olympus D40 Compared", "Author": "Michele \"Golfher\"", "ReviewID": "RJ21V3GPAFILF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own an Olympus E10 for my \"professional\" stuff.  But I  missed my Olympus pocket type camera when I gave it to my daughter.  I immediately keyed on the Olympus D40 but kept my options open.  I am concerned about color and so forth, but the important things in THIS camera were shutter lag time, ease of use for others, 4 meg results, speed and battery life.I had the chance to side by side compare.  Sorry Olympus, but you need to work on some things in pocket cameras.1.  Shutter Lag Time:  This is the time from pressing the \"button\" to getting a picture.  Though neither is extremely fast like the E10, the Canon is much faster than the Olympus.  You still need to pre-focus if shooting a moving target but with the Olympus, you still won't catch them in movement.  2.  Write Time:  The write time of the Canon is superior, especially using a microdrive--which it does.  Either I or II (microdrive).  I really prefer compact flash to SmartMedia, which is the like Beta to VHS in future I think.  It has it's place, but not in 4 meg cameras.3.  Ease of Use--Both cameras utilize one of the most user friendly systems around.  Equally impressed with both.  4.  Batteries:  I did like the idea of AA batteries in the Olympus--but my very good rechargables were drying up like crazy while I played with it.  The Canon's lithium rechargable isn't cheap and you need two, but I am greatly impressed so far.  The charger is light and plugs right into the outlet--no cord.  Canon wins, even with the propriatary battery...P>5.  Zoom:  Neither is going to bring the world in like a true telephoto, but the Canon is much better here also.6.  Startup Time:  When you pull open the lid, how long does it take to get a shot off?  That's why I have the pocket camera--spontaneity.  Canon again comes in first on time to ready.  Not alot, but faster.Bottomline is Canon easily won this Olympus photographer hands down.  I'd rate the Olympus D40Zoom a 4 plus, but the Canon Powershot ... a clear 5 for its class of camera.", "Date": "August 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "A good alternative to 35 mm", "Author": "Jason Crawford", "ReviewID": "RJ9PALGRFMGKF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a serious amateur photographer with several years of experience with multiple Canon products. I primarily take travel and outdoor photos and bought this camera to have a small digital camera to take when I did not want to lug my full 35 mm system around as it weighs almost 3 lbs. I found that I would not take the camera and several times missed great shots because of this.After waiting a couple of years for the megapixels to increase in smaller cameras, I purchased this before a trip to Hawaii last December. I took this camera and left the 35 mm at home. Overall, the camera functions remarkably well for its size. it has most modes of the Canon EOS system and the operation is very intuitive. It is a little slippery and I recommend extreme caution when handling this as it does tend to slip away from you. The pictures of my Hawaii trip turned out very well. The metering was accurate on all but the most difficult shots. For those difficult shots, I was able to adjust the exposure compensation to get the exposure dead on. The lens seemed to work well at all focal lengths; however, at telephoto, the aperature is very high and shots seemed to beg for a tripod. The flash works well up to a range of 15 feet.When I returned home, I printed all of my shots with an HP deskjet 960 on quality paper. I found that the resolution was adequate at the 5x7 size; but bad at 8x10. This is a limitation of the format and not the camera.  I think that I will take this camera along with the 35 mm systems on my future vacations. This is a wonderul tag along camera but no substitute for the resolution of a good 35 mm system for those \"money\" shots.All in all, this is the perfect camera for someone who would like to have a small quality camera that they can fit in their pocket or bag with no worry.

Harrell", "ReviewID": "R3TWGF5LSUYKH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon S40 is a superb digital camera.  First, the exterior: The S40 is compact and can fit easily in a jacket pocket (though not in a pants-pocket - for that you should check out Canon's digital Elph line); it has a convenient clamshell design; and unlike many of the other digital cameras I examined it is made of polished metal-not cheap plastic.  This is sturdier, feels better in the hands, and looks a whole lot sleeker.  Second, the interior: The S40 takes 4.0 megapixel pictures, which look great on any computer screen and will print out very nicely up to 5x7 and even 8x10.  Its ability to capture color is far superior to most other digital cameras.  Most of the control menus are reasonably easy to use.  It is packed with pre-set photographic options (for action shots, portraits, etc), but has full manual override for those of us who grew up on old-fashioned SLRs.  It also focuses much faster than many of the digital cameras I've seen - helpful for capturing wildlife or childrens' sports events.  Finally, the included battery is surprisingly long-lasting and recharges (with a very compact included recharger) quickly.Third, the software:  The S40 comes with Canon ZoomBrowser (for viewing) and ArcSoft's PhotoSuite (for photo-editing).  I find ZoomBrowser intuitive and can easily organize my photos, however it sometimes has problems printing on my inkjet printer.  The ArcSoft program is much less capable than Adobe's PhotoShop, but can delete red-eye (or unwanted individuals at the edge of a picture) without too much trouble.  On the whole, both should be adequate for the casual user.Are there drawbacks?  Well, yes, there are several.  Like most digital cameras, the S40 sometimes has problems focusing on the correct subject and, in automatic mode, often opens the aperature too wide (resulting in a narrow range of focus).  There is a way to manually focus the camera, but it is not terribly effective.  It is also impossible to attach separate lenses - but that drawback is common to any digital camera of this size.Bottom Line:  Despite the drawbacks, this is one of the best digital camera's I've seen.  It is conveneint, well-built, and easy to use out of the box.  I've already dragged it to Vermont, Atlanta, central Africa and Australia without a hitch-not to mention that I can take it on my frequent bicycle rides closer to home.  I'd be happy to send a sample photo demonstrating its resolution and color-capturing abilities (about 1.2 MB) if you ask.  On a final note, I would suggest buying a 256MB (or larger) compact flash card.

It was a very low resolution and was very battery hungry. Today's digital cameras has gone a long way. In fact, they can actually compete with film cameras in quality! Developing film is now in the past for me. This S40 will be my forth digital camera. I chose the S40 for it's size, all metal construction and Canon's name tag for their photography expertise. I knew if Canon put something out, it must sure be decent. The S40 retails for $..., I paid a hundred less by shopping around. I did however buy it from a Canon authorized dealer which cost a lot more than the \"gray market\" cameras online. I don't trust those discount places, I never read anything good about them. At first, I was disappointed with the S40 as I was playing with Canon's G2 right before I bought it. The S40 isn't as point and shoot as the G2 due to it's smaller size. It is much more sensitive to lighting conditions. Also due to it's small size, it is more difficult to hold steady. However, after a few days of playing with it and tweeking out the adjustments I was able to produce some very high quality pictures. The auto mode on the S40 is terrible and almost can not be used. It always seems to focus on the wrong part of the subject. For some reason, it tends to focus on the background more than the object you intended to shoot. This is due to their 3 box focusing system. Very similar to their Automatic SLR's. But I didn't have this problem with my Elan EOS. However there is a counter to this problem. I simply use their Tv or Av mode. This allows for focusing only in one box rather than three and it allows you to adjust the aperature or speed at touch of a button. This is truly a real camera and not only a point and shoot. It can be switched to full manual mode in just one click. I like the way it tells you exactly what f stop your are at and at what speed you are going to shoot. And with a simply push of a button you can change the f stop and speed very easily right before a shot. It's like a fully digital manual camera! The flash is slightly inadequate but not as bad as some other brands that I have tried. Also the battery is very short lived. It uses a proprietary lithium ion battery and is rated at giving you 180 pics with the screen on and 420 pics with the screen off. Not bad considering my last camera gave me about 30 pics with a set of batteries.It will however give you about 1 day of heavy usage, that's about it. You will almost definitely need a extra just to be safe. One of it's best feature is the design. I like the fact that I don't have to fumble with a dangling lens cover. The S40 incorporates it's lens cover with a clam shell design. Just slide the cover over and it turns on automatically, snap it closed and it shuts off. I also like the all metal construction. I hate plastic cameras! It also doubles as a camcorder. You can record short avi/mpeg movies. 30 secs in high resolution and 120 sec in low resolution. However this eats up memory in a hurry so if you like this feature, get ready to put out for some higher memory. The camera uses Compact Flash, which is slowly starting to turn into the industry standard in storage. It also allows you to use micro-drives if you are really into storing large batches of pics. This is a good camera for those who like things small. It's a beutifully designed piece of equiptment considering it's size. Does it compare to it's bigger brother, the G2? NO. But it's not designed to. This is a good compromise for those who want 4.0 megapixel in a small package. For those who need and want the best pictures possible from a digital camera I would recommend the G2 but for those who don't need the very best from a picture, this is a very good and well made camera.", "Date": "November 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "A small wonder", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R23R77C0QMFJO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the S20 before this, and I can't believe the improvement.  Like so many others, my S20 had the bluewash problem that was annoying even though correctable with image processing.  The S40 has no such problem.  I was also skeptical that I would see a difference upgrading from 3.2 to 4.0 megapixels, but the images do appear much sharper.  The zoom (3x as opposed to 2x on the S20) is easier to use and more responsive and the LCD display is also brighter and sharper.  The S40 has tons of manual options, some of which I have not yet explored (such as sound recording capabilities).  Additionally, Canon has now added the rechargable battery and charger to the package, which is a big plus.  The battery is also more compact and lighter.  The only annoyance there is that the AC adapter is a separate option, which is an inconvenience and a neccessity if you want to transfer the images from the camera to your computer without use of an external card reader (which is also an extra if you decide to go that route.)  All in all, the S40 is a sleek little camera with amazing photographic quality.

I did a lot of research before buying and am glad that I ended up with the PowerShot S40.  I generally agree with all the positive feedback of the other reviewers, but I thought I'd share the few gripes I have about  the camera in case they'll help others make their decision.1) The expensive and virtually useless \"AC power adapter\" accessory (sold separately) is NOT what you think it would be -- it does not let you plug the camera into an outlet and charge the battery.  Instead, its AC adapter end actually replaces the battery in the battery bay area.  So you have to remove the battery if you want to run the camera off the wall current.  Consequently, you must also use the separate battery charging unit to recharge the battery.  (If only this camera came with a USB/Charging \"cradle\" like some of its competitors!  That's my biggest regret with this camera.)2) The camera has a habit of falling asleep during the middle of long uploads, interrupting the upload.  (This is a big bug -- obviously, when the computer and the camera are actively transferring, the sleep mechanism of the camera should not kick in, but it does.)3) The flash setting (I always prefer No Flash) is NEVER saved when the camera shuts down -- even when it sleeps.  Consequently, in the course of a casual day or evening of occasional use, you a) either remember to keep turning off the flash every time you want to take a picture, or b) end up taking the picture with the flash and then having to re-take it without.  The default flash setting should be one of the many preferences in the camera's system menu.4) When you rotate an image in the camera, the image is not actually rotated when you import it into the computer -- you have to go and rotate them all over again after importing (this is using Mac OS X (Image Import and iPhoto applications).  Maybe it's different with other applications, but I doubt it.Otherwise, this is a great camera with a great user interface -- it makes simple, point-and-click use easy, and hard, all-manual things possible.  There are even some great semi-manual modes.

I've been through an entry level HP Photosmart, 1.3MP Canon A50, 2.1MP Canon S10, 3.34MP Nikon 995, and now the Canon S40. First of all I believe the Canon interface is far superior to Nikon's. It's cleaner and more simple. What I like:1) It's compact but not too small. You can't take a picture if your camera is too big to lug around.2) Its metal construction is quality to the nth degree. At a time when consumer electronics feels flimsy as far as I'm concerned (too much plastic), it's nice to own something that's built so well with good material.3) The picture quality is excellent. Like I said, this is my 5th digicam and the image quality is the best, by far. The colors are rich and the detail amazing. Everyone who has seen my photos are amazed.4) The video feature is nice. You might not think it's necessary but I find the ability to capture up to 30 seconds of video (albiet not of the best quality) very useful.5) Battery life is much improved vs. the older Canons and the Nikon. Without LCD on, you can take well over 100 shots.What I don't like:1) The macro performance is poor. The Nikon 995 did an amazing job in the area.2) Low light situations results in poor shots.What you'll need:1) A larger memory card, at least 128MB. I went with a 256MB Viking which works really well. It's fast and holds up to 120 shots on the highest resolution setting.2) A bag to protect your investment, I recommend the Lowepro 10AW. It's VERY well padded, has slots for an extra battery and memory card, and is lightweight. Some may opt for a smaller bag. It's a matter of preference.3) I got an extra rechargeable battery. It's a safety net actually since battery performance is pretty good and you can always bring your charger along.4) A LCD protector because the screen is prone to scratches.

I had some basic criteria's for what my camera should do.(1) - It should be small and portable. The Powershot S40 is a small and compact camera, although it is a bit heavier than other cameras with the same size. However, since it is made of metal, it gives you a sturdy feeling.

The Powershot S40 takes pictures with good quality (based on my weeks of experience) and with its 4 million pixels, you can easily select a part of a picture and still have nice resolution. By having 4 million pixels it is easy to select a part of an image (cropping) and print/use that one, for example the upper right corner of the picture is all I want or maybe just the face of your girlfriend to put in your wallet. If the number of pixels are to few you might not be able to use this technique. Also, since of the high resolution, you can easily print sharp nice pictures.(3) - It should be simple but at the same time have the possibility to let me \"grow into the camera\". The Powershot S40 provides a fully automatic mode that allows you to take those simple \"point and shoot\" pictures. The camera has several pre-defined modes for different occasions (night scene, landscape, portrait and so on) that make the camera easy to use. Furthermore, the camera allows you to adjust many parameters (if you want to) such as shutter speed, aperture priority and ISO film-speed. After a couple of weeks of use I have been able to take pictures that I have never been able to take before using an automatic camera, for example in dark conditions, night shots and so on. These photos can now be made good. However, nothing is perfect. There are 3 things one must have in mind when deciding to buy this camera listed in importance order:(1) - You need more memory. The provided memory card is way too small. You need at least 128MB in order to not have to transfer pictures to your computer so often. On one 128MB card I usually store around 100 pictures. 128MB cards are quite affordable today.(2) - You need an extra battery. Using only one battery is ok for most situations, but these days when you are taking more photos, for example at a party when you are showing the pictures to your friends using the LCD screen of you camera, the battery will not last. Having a spare battery solves this problem. I guess it is possible, but you will have to work hard in order to use up 2 batteries in one day. Recharging a battery is very fast, usually between one and 2 hours.(3) - The camera is a bit heavier than other cameras with the same size. This is not a problem to me though. With its small size I could (before I bought a camera bag) carry the camera in the pocket of my jeans.Enough said. I strongly recommend this camera that is suitable for most users. It produces great pictures and it provides a lot of possibilities for manual adjustments together with a nice set of predefined automatic operation modes.

Once I decided that nothing is going to replace my SLR system for speed, flexibility, or quality of image for all situations (at any price range?), then it became clear I had to accept some compromises.I simply wanted a compact digital camera that produced high quality photographs - not snapshots.  Why take pictures if the potential quality is not going to excellent?  It is a false economy to invest in a camera that does not even have the capability to produce high quality photographs.  I think this camera has overcome that burden and has the potential.  It is not perfect on an absolute scale (so it really shouldn't get 5 stars), but for what it delivers, it is a buy.Some compromises:Since it IS compact, the controls are small and the on-screen icons are small and a little hard to read.All the functionality is there if you want full control, but you need to master the manual pretty well to get full use of it AND be fast on the draw to navigate the controls to get the results you want in fast changing photo situations.The auto-focus and exposure lag is still not what it should be and is not fast enough to replace a manual SLR.The lens is slow (f2.8 wide angle and f4.9 telephoto) limiting use in low light situations without a flash.  But, it is sharp.Like other people have said, get a 128 MEG flash card, an extra battery, and a USB flash card reader for your computer to make this a fully functional package.I consider this camera as my quick \"take-along\" camera that can produce high quality images when I don't want to lug around my SLR gear.  I tried it for sports photography but it is too slow and without enough zoom (3x, to about 100mm 35mm standard).

It has point-and-shoot capabilities with all the manual controls of the bigger G2. The ISO 50 with raw mode capability and the razor sharp Canon lens allow me to have great looking 11x14\" printouts with even a 16x20 is possible. The raw mode gives you lossless information from the CCD at one-third the storage space requirement in the camera. Once in the computer it can be expanded (losslessly) to the Tiff image. This is a big savings on space in the camera allowing you to take 2 to 3 times the high resolution pictures when compared to other cameras! It has many modes for specialized situations but I prefer the P mode which allows me to use the ISO 50 (automatic mode sets the camera to ISO 100) and let the camera do most of the work. With such a high resolution camera you will need an additional compact-flash card (128 meg or above)and possibly an extra battery.

I am a very, very loyal Sony customer and was all set to buy their new 4 megapixel camera until I started looking into Canon.  Granted, it's not quite as small as the Sony, and it just doesn't have the same design elan, but when you get down to what counts - the ability to take fantastic pictures - I don't think any other 4MP out there can beat it.  The reviewers at the online digital photography review sites seem to agree.I found it for a reasonably good price and decided to take the leap.  As promised, it took fantastic point-and-shoot pics and even better manually adjusted shots.  There did seem to be a little trouble with some of the automatic settings wherein the picture came out a bit blurry, but futzing with the setting seemed to help a lot. All in all, though, I have nothing but praise for this small little wonder.  (In case you're worried, the body of this thing is extremely solid.  It's primarily made of metal - not plastic like most others out there.)The great thing is that the S40 does it all.  I took great close-ups of flowers, action shots of a dog running, landscape shots, portraits of friends.  All of these shots have an almost professional quality and cause every one who sees them to comment on how well they turn out.In almost every case, the colors are true - never too dull, never over saturated.  The focus is very sharp, as well.  And since it's a 4MP, you can make nice sized prints - at least 8x10 - without making them appear pixelated.Overall, the camera is easy to learn.  The controls can be a bit complex, but the manual is clear.  For those who prefer the trial and error method, the S40 won't pose too much trouble.  Everything is fairly intuitive, however, and even confirmed technophobes get the hang of it after a while.  One hint:  Be sure to adjust your screen for maximum resolution before viewing the pictures.  The CCD on the S40 is far crisper than most monitors, and so shots might not appear in their full splendor unless you make the screen resolution very, very high.  A few caveats:  the accompanying software - ZoomX Browser, or some such - is pretty basic.  You can't do much with it, even compared to the stripped down (and much better) Adobe programs out there.  Also, I'm using the camera on both an XP machine and on a Windows ME machine.  With XP, the computer reads it just like another hard-drive, making it exceptionally easy to grap and import photos.  With ME, it's a bit buggier.  I needed to call Canon's tech support (helpful and quick to answer the phone, by the way) in order to resolve conflicts between the camera and my printer.  Anyway, this camera is well worth the investment.  It won't make you a pro, but it will at least make your shots look that way.", "Date": "July 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great, technical wonder; very few faults; not for beginners", "Author": "H.

It takes beautiful pictures, offers a greater number of options than many other renowned cameras and can be used both for simple tasks and also for tasks that requires advanced settings.Advantages:The S40 has many advantages, in general too many to complete in a list. But here are few of the most important issues: - Impressingly clear pictures. - A lots of options; most of them are simple to use - Can be used by mid-pros, semi-pros and even pros. - Microdrives can be used, offering up to 1 Gb of  memory (5500 pics at min. res.). - The camera can record video and sound. - A surprising performance in low-ligh situations.Drawbacks:The biggest drawback is the multicontroler. It is the second most used button on the camera (only the sutter button is more often used).  It offers the user to select up, down, left, right and enter (pushing the multicontroller button IN).  It is easy to push in the four directions but requies almost a luck to success in pressing the button in.  I would have preferred another button for the 'in' selection.The second drawback is how difficult it is for beginners to master the usage of the autofocus system. As a user, you'll have to select which spot of the proposed picture frame is going to be used as the auto-focus spot.  Changing spots can be a little complicated so I believe that many users will just take 'another picture' to get the focus right instead of mastering the manual and the methodology behind the autofocus system.Other drawbacks are completely minor.  Often, the camera's setting & options can be complicated.  But that cannot be regarded as a drawback because it isn't possible to have a camera with all this great options if it is ought to be simple in all occurrences.", "Date": "April 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Power shot S40 doesn\ufffdt disappoint", "Author": "Greg Smith \"gjbelly\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y2ER8F1ZF36R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera now for about 4 months and it is one of the best purchases I have made in the last few years. The pictures produced by the S40 are great, and color reproduction is on right on target. Why I bought the S40 over the G2?The main reason I bought the S40 instead of the G2, another great camera, is portability and size. I find the S40's smaller size more convenient and I am more likely to bring it when I go out, and thus more likely to use it. I also liked the S40's feel and look. It is a sturdy camera and well built, which is important if you tend to be rough on things as I am. What's good, what's not?It is hard to complain about the S40. Pictures come out colorful and sharp. The S40 also has so many options for a point in shoot, including manual settings and aperture and shutter control.  It also has a movie mode and while it is not a replacement for a video camera, I found that taking a couple 30 second movies at events in addition to pictures really improves your memory of the event/party/whatever. The S40 also has amazing resolution for a point and shoot... You can pretty much make prints as large as you want. At 8 x 10, this camera produces pictures indistinguishable from film, and can probably produce much larger prints with the same quality, although I haven't tried myself. Also the battery, though proprietary, has good stamina, however you should get at least one additional backup battery. Last this camera has an unbelievable flash. My wife is actually scared sometimes to have pictures taken of her at night because the flash is so strong. Flash is very important to digital cameras in general where low light tends to be an Achilles heel. Like most digital cameras, there are a few places where there is room for improvement. The two biggest problems with the S40 that I have found, neither of which should steer you from this camera, are the controller and the AF. The controller is a little awkward to use in selecting. The button is hard to push in while not accidentally pushing up down left or right. The other area for improvement is the Auto Focus. At times the camera has trouble focusing on the subject. This only happens occasionally, but can be frustrating when you got a good picture that comes out blurry (You can't tell it's blurry on the LCD). This seems to be something that occurs throughout the canon line of cameras, even the high end digital SLR's, and many digital cameras have some focus problems, especially in low light, but canons focus light usually takes care of the problem.  Picture qualityI have read some reviews on here that say the resolution is the same as there 2 MP camera, don't believe it. Anyone who says the resolution on this camera is poor probably doesn't know anything about digital photography. For example, most digital cameras base there photo quality on resolution, which is the size of the digital photo. If you zoom two pictures, one a 4 MP and one a 2 MP to 200% they both may look equally pixilated. This is because when you zoom in on a picture you are comparing pixels per inch more then resolution, and in many cases the pixels per inch can be the same on a 4MP as in a 2MP. (Most lower end cameras capture at 72 pixels per inch (but can be higher), the S40 captures at 180 pixels per inch on the highest setting). So, total quality of the picture is the pixels per inch and the number of inches you have. Also, it doesn't help that the software Canon provides with the camera reduces the resolution for viewing in the program (At least that's my impression). Some graphics software does this to make layout with pictures easier, requiring less computer power, because you are not moving the full resolution version of the picture around (Quark, a popular layout program for designers does the same thing, however there should be no loss the picture quality when you actually go to print). To really appreciate the picture quality you should use a program like Adobe Photoshop. Also, when you print a picture out, especially an 8x10 or larger, you should first change the pixels per inch to a higher level. I usually up the pixels per inch in Photoshop to 1000 and then adjust the document size to the desired size. You don't add any information this way, but I found it helps the printer create sharper better quality prints. Also make sure you properly setup you printer to print best quality on photo paper, highest res and slow to maximize quality. ConclusionThis camera is a great buy and promises to make a great replacement for your point in shoot film camera. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone and have yet to find another camera that I believe is better for a mid range consumer camera, except maybe the G2, which is slightly better but bulkier 12/12/02. Also, with 4MP, this camera is unlikely to become obsolete anytime soon, as you would need to get a 16MP camera to double the resolution of this camera. (You need 4 times the MP to double resolution. I.e. a 4MP is double the res of a 1 MP and 50% better then a 2MP)", "Date": "December 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "David J.

Not quite small enough to fit in a normal pocket, but it's still quite portable. Great pictures -- prints are clear and color rendition is quite good. Not up to a good SLR for those really critical shots, but great for most situations. Has a relatively fast shutter delay for a digital. Flash is barely adequate and there's no provision for adding another. This is a common problem for small digital cameras. The optical viewfinder is small and captures only about 80% of the picture frame. I find it worthless, but one adjusts to using the LCD screen. In time I doubt that I'll even miss the viewfinder.Easy to use and everything is organized so that the more complex features don't get in the way of the ones you use 95% of the time.

White balance is better, there is less noise, there seems to be higher dynamic range, and I get fewer washed out pictures outdoors. Shutter lag is much less (although autofocus seems slower), and it has a 3x versus 2x zoom. Flash also seems stronger. I also like the image dial, not sure why they didn't do this from the start (or just copy all the controls from their 35mm SLRs).The best new features are the video clips and RAW mode images that are not much bigger than superfine JPEG. I can now get lossless images off the camera and play with them without paying a TIFF-sized penalty. I've been using Breezebrowser to do batch conversions and it works well. The video clip capability is also cool - I always thought it was stupid when this started showing up on digicams, but it is great for filming kids. The 30-second limitation isn't as much of an issue as I thought, though the quality is lacking. Can't wait until these little digicams get 640x480 at 30fps - would still not be as good as the miniDV camcorder I have, but I hardly ever use the camcorder, whereas I almost always have the digicam.The only negative I've seen so far is that the autofocus seems to be worse than on the S20 - slower, noisier, and has problems in low light conditions. Part of this may be the AF focus assist light on this seems dimmer than the S20. Overall though, the focusing system is more flexible - settable focus points plus manual focus if you really want. And you can set metering too. And finally, hitting the AE lock button while holding shutter button halfway will fire the preflash, letting you use this camera with standard slave strobes - kind of kludgy, but cheaper than springing for one of the new \"digital\" ones that support cameras with preflash. In addition to the camera itself, there is a nice underwater case for it that is under $. For most other digicams you have to shell out major $$$, often more than the cost of the camera, for third party underwater housings. This alone would have been a major factor in choosing the camera; in addition to using it when diving, which I do infrequently, it's also great for taking beach or pool pictures without worrying about getting the camera wet, and even with the case the size is pretty small.All in all, a pleasant upgrade - twice the camera at half the price I paid for my S20 two years ago. Of course in another two years the S60 will be twice as good and half the price of the S40.

With all the great reviews everywhere, my expectations were high when I started exploring the thing. And the S40 surely is a nice camera: beautiful finish, good controls (apart from the multi-controller which is too small and unstable), impressive sharpness and colours and a lot of manual-control possibilities. And once you get familiar with the menus it is easy - but not very fast - to operate the camera.But I returned the S40 because:1) The lens suffers from huge barrel distortion. The camera is simply uncapable of reproducing a straight line outside the centre of the picture. Most zoom lenses - even on SLR's - suffer to some extent from this disease, but this is about the worst I've ever encountered. The problem is present at all focal lenghts within the S40's range, but worst in wideangle mode. Buildings and plane surfaces bulge out in an almost psychedelic way which is very unnatural and unpleasing - to my eye, at least. It is a mystery to me why this phenomena is so seldomly mentioned in reviews. Once you are aware of it, you will notice immidiately. Maybe the lens on the Canon G2 performs better in this respect (I haven't tried it yet). But then you might as well bring your old SLR, since the G2 is too bulky for your pocket anyway.2) The coverage of the optical viewfinder is ridiculously small. You get at least 25% more in the final picture than you see in the viewfinder. Since the LCD-screen is useless in bright light (and will drain your battery faster than necessary) this means that a lot of cropping will be needed. In reality you will often waste a megapixel or more before you hold the final result in your hands. If you are into careful edge-to-edge picture composing you should consider other alternatives than the S40. But, sadly, most viewfinders I have seen on digital cameras are even worse than this.Why don't any manufacturers produce a compact digital camera like the S40, but with a decent viewfinder, an option for external flash and a fast high-quality lens with a fixed focal length equal to the classic 35 mm (in other words: a mini Leica)? I would buy it on the spot. 25 years ago the market was flooded with small, inexpensive compact 35 mm cameras like this. I own one of the kind (the classic Ricoh 500G), and it still takes extremely beautiful pix. With the possibily of auto-exposure, fully manual controls and without trigger delay, fisheye-infected perspective or ridiculous vignetting. I want a digital version. Someone give it to me, please!In my opinion the S40 is a great (but slightly expensive) pocket companion for snapshots and everyday non-critical use. But if you are looking for a serious alternative to a good SLR or viewfinder camera, this is not it. I, at least, will save my money for tomorrow, when a digital SLR-body comes within my financial reach.

I did find that the camera has the ability to control the shutter speed for longer exposure but it's not as convenient during a trip.  At the same time, I also compared pictures taken from the S40 to my friend's Elfp S200 and you can definitely see a quality difference.  I shots from the S40 have much more color depth.A improvement I would like to see is a better zoom.  It seems that 3x zoom is acceptable given the size but more would be better.  Obviously there is a digital zoom but I tried it and without a tripod for stability, it can be quite useless.On of the nice features I've found in this camera that didn't exist in older digital models was when you take a picture, this camera actually sounds a clicking noise.  I realize this is a really small thing but when you give your camera to a stranger to help you take a picture, you'd be surprised what a different this makes.To sum it up, you can't go wrong with this camera if you're looking for a compact digital camera with some flexible features.", "Date": "November 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Wonderful.", "Author": "Rheumor", "ReviewID": "RLQRJBOVO6BYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a little tank of a camera, with great optics and a decent optical & digital zoom combination, as well as awesome resolution.

However, when it comes to buying a new product, particularly electronics, I go through most of what is for sale at that moment. I decided in mid. April that it was time for me to buy a digital camera. Reading lots of reviews of various cameras for a couple of days on the internet gave me a picture of the cameras which were among the best on the market at that time and I ended up with the Canon Powershot S40. Throughout the review all comments applies also to the S30 version. The differences between the two models are the number of pixels used and S30 also provides you with the option of take pictures using film speed ISO 800. S30 is also a bit cheaper.I had some basic criteria's for what my camera should do.(1) - It should be small and portable. Since carrying your camera with you or not is what is going to decide weather or not you will be able to capture those moments that occur every now and then.(2) - It should take great pictures. Having captured that special moment, verifying that it looks nice on the small LCD-screen on the camera, and going home to find out (when you look at the picture on your computer) that it is blurry or got some other flaws, is not the situation we want. Another important property is the number of pixels the camera use. Having more pixels allows you to select a part of an image (cropping) and print/use that one, for example the upper right corner of the picture is all I want or maybe just the face of your girlfriend to put in your wallet. If the number of pixels are to few you might not be able to use this technique. (3) - It should have the possibility to let me \"grow into the camera\". Being not professional, I wanted to have a simple to use camera that allows me to just take photos with one click. On the other hand, since of the great feature of digital cameras which allows you to see the actual picture directly after you take it and if you want, delete it, I suspected that I would start to do more experiments with photography, i.e., adjusting shutter speed and changing parameters (actually I have after a couple of weeks use which allows me to take pictures that I have never been able to take before using an automatic camera, for example in dark conditions, night shots and so on. These photos can now be made good). What the Canon provides is a fully automatic mode that allows you to take those simple \"point and shoot\" pictures as well as other modes that gives you the possibility to adjust more parameters. The camera has several pre-defined modes for different occasions (night scene, landscape, portrait and so on) that make the camera easy to use.The Canon Powershot S40 fulfils all these criteria's and it is giving me a lot of great pictures. However, nothing is perfect. There are 3 things one must have in mind when deciding to buy this camera listed in importance order:(1) - You need more memory. The provided memory card is way too small. You need at least 128MB in order to not have to transfer pictures to your computer so often. On one 128MB card I usually store around 100 pictures. 128MB cards are quite affordable today.(2) - You need an extra battery. Using only one battery is ok for most situations, but these days when you are taking more photos, for example at a party when you are showing the pictures to your friends using the LCD screen of you camera, the battery will not last. Having a spare battery solves this problem. I guess it is possible, but you will have to work hard in order to use up 2 batteries in one day. Recharging a battery is very fast, usually between one and 2 hours.(3) - The camera is a bit heavier than other cameras with the same size. This is not a problem to me though. With its small size I could (before I bought a camera bag) carry the camera in the pocket of my jeans.Enough said. I strongly recommend this camera that is suitable for most users. It produces great pictures and it provides a lot of possibilities for manual adjustments together with a nice set of predefined automatic operation modes.

There is a noticable difference between RAW and the highest JPEG setting, especially when you start cropping and blowing up.

My brother's Elph works beautifully at 2 MP.I chose the Canon S40 for the price to functionality and after three months I still think it was a good choice. Since my price range for all the accessories was $...I couldn't go for the Canon G2.I had to choose between the G2's fantastic functionality that still wouldn't match my Pentax 35mm with beautiful lenses...and a smaller camera that I would actually use. I was tired of dragging my Pentax with its many lenses and flash around - I needed a smaller camera. The Canon Elph would have been my choice, except the smaller the camera the more it costs to get the same functionality.Now to the end result - Apart from the not-so wonderful flash distance, the Canon S40 takes beautiful pictures. Took daylight shots of the Grand Canyon, night shots of Las Vegas and some family pictures inside. Daylight shots were dreamy, family pictures with flash at close range were good. Distant shots in a badly lit room - not good at all. Distant shots at night required a steady hand and a change to the night setting. I had no issues with the camera - I have a steady hand!

Serious photographers seekng a digital would turn to Canon's EOS Digital Rebel. The S30 and S40 are good cameras if you want lots of features in a small package without paying a lot of money.Features begin with the generous maximum 4 megapixel image size (you can make them smaller to conserve space on the CompactFlash card). Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc. You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both. There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound. These video clips are 320 x 200 pixels.  This small camera fits in a purse or shirt pocket easily and won't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included, just buy a generic).  But you pay a price for the small size: the optical zoom is limited to 3x.  And unfortuately, the S40, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out with a focal length of 11mm, which is a very wide-angle view. Even at 3X optical zoom you will max out at 55mm, often not as close as you'd need.  There is a digital zoom, but so what?  Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature.  I found 55mm insufficient for shooting across a large room.  If you work closer in this won't be a problem, but it is not a good focal length for shooting children, who stop whatever adorable thing they're doing when they notice you framing that shot.  (And see comment on slow shutter response, below.)The sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy and can cause problems. My 3YO niece got ahold of my S40 and ripped the door off. I was able to reattach it but now it's a loose tooth, ready to fall off again. Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it. I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all. I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.One of the S40's most frustrating limitations is a slow shutter response.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score. The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks.  If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue.  Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap. I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free.  I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit.  At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.One difference between the S30 and S40 is the latter only allows an ISO of 400 which restricts low-light photography.  This is a limitation of the larger CCD in the S40.  ISO 800 shots on the S30 are quity noisy so it isn't clear you are missing this feature in the S40, and you gain an extra megapixel.I still give this camera 4 stars for putting so many features in such a small package. The pictures are reasonably good, and at this size you can crop plenty out and still print good 4x6 inch images. The PowerShot S40 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package, such as Photoshop Elements. The one provided is fairly limited. Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots. The included 32 MB CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card.

But, in auto mode, the camera is less than spectacular - probably not as good as the A20. Flash shots at night almost always seem over exposed. I have had to use the M mode and dial down the flash brilliance. The camera has a tough time of focusing in average light conditions. If you have the camera set up through the center meter for focus (again, manually set), it works pretty well. But if you, again, use the auto mode, the algorithm between the difference points of reference it uses to focus, can cause the image to look very \"soft\". In all I really like the camera (albeit that it doesn't sound like I do), but my wife truely hates it due to the fact that in order to get decent photos she has to have the camera in specific modes. Therefore the WAF (wife acceptance factor) is a big 2 out of 5.Another annoyance with the camera, is the multi-something on the right rear of the camera. You use this for erasing shots, and moving around. It is very hard to properly press, particularly if you just want to press straight in.

The S40 has tons of manual options, some of which I have not yet explored (such as sound recording capabilities).  Additionally, Canon has now added the rechargable battery and charger to the package, which is a big plus.  The battery is also more compact and lighter.  The only annoyance there is that the AC adapter is a separate option, which is an inconvenience and a neccessity if you want to transfer the images from the camera to your computer without use of an external card reader (which is also an extra if you decide to go that route.)  All in all, the S40 is a sleek little camera with amazing photographic quality.  It is perfect for people wanting a point-and-shoot digital camera of the highest quality and portability that is self explanatory right out of the box.  (I would recommend reading the manual for the more advanced and manual opperation features.)", "Date": "January 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "A nearly professional-grade camera at an affordable price!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R153C455Y0T9XW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All that I can say is \"WOW.\" The Canon S40 has met, and exceeded my expectations. This is not my first digital camera, I also own a Sony Digital Mavica FD-72. A few months ago I realized that the Sony was not performing well in any situation where the lighting was less than ideal (Bright sunny days or bright indoor lighting).My first question was \"What am I doing wrong?\" So I purchased the book Digital Photography For Dummies\u00ae by Julie Adair King from Amazon. After reading through the first 5 chapters, and surfing several Mavica websites, I began to realize that it wasn't me but the camera I was using. So I began my quest for a better camera. I based my requirements on recommendations from the aforementioned book and website reviews.What I desired was a camera that was simple enough for a novice to use but also had enough, more advanced, settings for difficult lighting situations. An additional requirement was the size. My Sony Mavica is almost as big as a digital video camera, I wanted something smaller. The next major requirement was the photo size. The largest picture that my Mavica will take is 640 x 480. Other requirements included a view-finder in addition to a LCD screen, long battery life, and lots of storage capacity. The Mavica had a LCD screen only, it was difficult to see in bright sunlight. In addition, the Mavica drained the battery quickly and a floppy disk only holds about 1.5 megs.The Canon S40 met all my requirements at a reasonable price. So far I've only used the Auto, or novice, mode and have yet to get a bad picture. I've tested my two cameras side by side and the Canon always excels.I highly reccommend this product.BTW, I first considered the Canon Digital Elph, model S300 because of the price. However, the Elph lacked the more advanced feartures like manual shutter control and apateur. I'm now glad that I paid a little more and the S40 is not that much bigger.", "Date": "December 20, 2001"}, {"Title": "It doesn't get any better than this!!!", "Author": "\"thephool\"", "ReviewID": "RNEEMMQ41W5VO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nuf Said!After 6 months of research finally the perfect camera was born- A top quality pocket size camera with every conceivable feature (Audio & Video to all manual controls).Thank You Cannon!

We purchased this camera because our Cannon Power Shot S40 (which was the same type camera we purchased from the buyer) was dropped by accident.  Our previous camera took excellent pictures, with little elasped time, and required no adjusting when on auto.  The Cannon Power Shot that we purchased, and that I am reviewing, took very unfocused and fuzzy pictures.  Even when on auto mode, it was time comsuming to try to get the picture focused and clear.  I used the camera for a school function, and the pictures were basically terrible.  One of our presenters, who was a meterologist for a local news station, requested copies of the pictures I took.  I sent him the requested pictures with along with an apology for the poor picture quality. I sent examples to the buyer of the pictures I took with the camera to show her the type of pictures the camera was taking.Unfortunately, the buyer stated that she questioned the validity of our reason for returning the camera.  In questioning the validity of the return, I feel that she is also questioning our integrity.  The reason we sent a new battery and extra flash card was because we could no longer use them due to no longer owning that type of camera and felt that instead of throwing them away, we would send it back with the camera. We did not consider that sending back these items would give such a negative impression.I am very frustrated that because we were not satisfied with our purchased and chose to return the item, our legitimate complaint is questioned.

Especially if you use a Mac because it works great with iPhoto.  If youre a beginner like me, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of features the S40 offers, but dont worry.  Just put it on automatic and you will be able to take great pictures.  It just takes a little practice to get used to the delayed response shutter button.Some of the things I like about it:1.  It takes very nice pictures.  Your pictures will look as good as anyones.2.  It has a movie mode that I didnt know existed until recently.  Saves the movie (with sound) in AVI format (QuickTime player will play it)3.  Attractive small body (and who doesnt like attractive small bodies?)4.  The LCD display is great for reviewing your pictures5.  It takes gigantic pictures.  At 100% they are about 20\" tall by 30\" wide.  You probably wont ever print out anything this large, but this just means you have a lot of detail and resolution wont be a problem.What I dont like as much:1.  Too many manual settings keeps me from experimenting too much.  You would have to read the manual if you want to do any shooting besides automatic.  And who wants to read a manual?2.  You have to get pretty close to your subject.  Taking group pictures from much further than 10'-15' will not turn out very good.  If you can get up close you will have great pictures.  Dont try to use this camera at a football game from the stands.  I just dont think it has enough zoom power.Ive enjoyed using mine for the last year and a half.  Like the reviewers before me, I recommend doing the following:1.  Get an extra battery cause you never know when the battery will run out of juice.  It will cost $25-$50 depending on what brand you get.2.  Im not sure what size compact flash card comes with the camera, but its probably in the 16MB range which is pretty much useless.  Being a 4.0 Megapixel camera, and shooting such a large picture, it eats up memory.  Get a couple of 128MB's or even larger if you can and you will have room to take 100 or so pictures.3.  I dont think it comes with Photoshop Elements, but if you can afford it, get it.  If you do cropping and getting photos web-ready you will want to have this or the full Photoshop package (you better be very good if you want Santa to bring this)You will like this camera and all your friends will tell  you that you take great pictures.", "Date": "December 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "Things you want to know before you decide to buy Canon S40", "Author": "AmazonShopper", "ReviewID": "R2G16UNNLCKEMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "(1).

After you start shooting movie, you can't zoom.  This is unbelievable inconvenient.(3). Only AVI format for movie clip is available.  I think mpeg format is better.  File size will be smaller.(4). Amoung about 100 pics I took, I bearly remember any one that does not have red eye, even though I used red-eye reduction flash.(5). Distortion on the photo edge, as you see in all other small cameras.(6). My friend has a Sony digital camera, when it is connected to PC, you see the camera like a hard drive or CD.
