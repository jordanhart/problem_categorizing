{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Flash bulb was defective, but otherwise great", "Author": "Corey Scott", "ReviewID": "RSEZJQV4LBNK9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My rating doesn't reflect the fact that the flash bulb in mine was doa, because that could just as easily happen to any camera... It's just a little annoying that their QC department didn't catch it.  Anyways, Amazon is sending me a new one, and letting me use this one until the new one gets here.The quality is great overall.  Using ISO100 mode with a quick shutter speed produces an awesome quality outdoor scenery shot.  For indoors, I found that using the automatic shutter settings worked best, and indeed worked well.  I took a photo of a $5 bill (fitting the whole bill in the frame), and was able to clearly read the little \"united states of america\" written in the border around Lincoln's portrait.  In fact, I could even see the ink bleed on each of the little letters.  For outdoor shots, the 4x zoom doesn't seem to cost the photos any quality, and could even show some details better than i could see them with my own eyes, and I have perfect vision.With that said, there are a couple points which i don't like about the camera.  First, the quality of photos drops dramatically when you use an ISO setting much higher than 100.  Don't even bother with the ISO3200, it looks substantially worse than a cell phone camera.  I also don't like that it's one of sony's only cameras that doesn't have a Carl-Zeiss lens.  I was so used to Sony cameras using one, that I was surprised to find out that mine doesn't.  The Sony lens that it uses seems to work very well though, it may not even be noticeably different.  I also don't like that you have to remove the battery to charge it.  You can buy an additional charger that plugs directly into the camera, but why wouldn't they just give you one in the first place?  If i wanted to pay another $20 for that, then i would've just paid an extra $20 towards a more expensive camera to begin with.Overall I really like this camera, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a very cheap, but decent quality camera.  I am using mine with an 8GB Sandisk Memory Stock Pro Duo, which holds 1900 photos at full resolution, or 5.5 hours of video.--------------Update: Amazon was out of this camera, so they refunded my money, and I got a Sony DSC-W290 instead, which I am much happier with overall.  It's double the price though, so I guess you get what you pay for.  I don't think the S950 is the level of quality where you could expect to be happy with the camera for years to come; it's more of an introductory camera that you'd probably plan on replacing a year later.  I would change my rating to 3 stars if amazon let me.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointing First Sony Cybershot", "Author": "High Standards", "ReviewID": "RQD8BGPJ2E8K8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I unfortunately agree with the other reviews.

This is a big problem for me.  Don't be deceived by the online images, this is NOT a standard cable.  I would not have purchased this camera if I would have known this upfront.2) Bulky:  I assumed that this camera would be slimmer so it could fit in my pocket easier.  Yes, it WILL fit in my pocket, but it's wide enough that they could have used AA batteries.3) The face recognition has never properly identified more than one person in the same shot.4) Flash is weak.5) Cannot zoom in video mode.The pictures are adequate, but better than my older digital cameras.Ok... what are the positives:1) Screen is a nice size.  The lack of a view finder provides an even bigger screen.2) Zoom is sufficient.  About as good as I would expect of a camera this size.3) Handles red-eye well.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony Means \"No Baloney\"", "Author": "RCAV8TOR", "ReviewID": "R2LZE1TUFC6QK1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my girlfriend to replace her Nikon Coolpix because sand & digital cameras don't mix. She took the Nikon to the beach & got sand in the lens mechanism & it never recovered from that indecent exposure...Back to the Sony. It's a good point & shoot camera. Not too fancy & very easy to use. I have the DSC-S650 (older model) & like it a lot. The S950 is very much the same with a higher mega pixel rating. Shots are crisp & clear with auto adjustment, which I use almost exclusively, so this setting \"should\" consistently produce good results. Can't always say that about the subject matter though...The video mode is always a nice feature but it does have its limitations. You can't zoom in or out while you are in this setting. You can, however, zoom in while in the still photo mode & then switch to video afterwords using that last zoom setting. Most people don't know this little trick.Probably the only downside is the battery. The S950 uses Sony's proprietary (expensive) battery. You'll need to purchase an extra Sony battery for the S950 if you use it a lot & don't have the charger, or don't have time to charge the one battery. Remember to check the charge status so you don't end up with a dead battery when you need your camera the most for that graduation, wedding or bachelorette party, right girls?Last comment is you should get at least a 2G memory stick at time of purchase.

Well, with the Cyber-Shot DSC-S950 you do not get what you paid for. For starters, you need a Sony only memory card, battery, and USB cables. They have adjusted the size of these items to only fit into thier cameras. So... any previous memory cards, batteries or cables are now obsolete and you have to buy the Sony Brand. The picture quality is very dark and at times very out of focus. Unless you have the perfect lighting you will end up with subpar pics. It also does not let you zoom during video mode and the audio is barely there. When you want to look back at pics it takes a second to focus every time for each pic which makes it very annoying when you want to scan through your photos. My previous camera was about $50 less exspensive and was a much better product.

I've been feeling camera-handicapped these past few weeks so when there was a sale at staples offering this camera at $97 i decided, why not? I had been meaning to get one because i broke my other camera, which was a samsung s600. ALso, take note that i am not really a professional photographer. More like a point and shoot sort of gal. Although i will in the future invest in an slr of some sort.ANYWAYS, I will be updating this post over the time i have it and if after two days i find it adequate, i'll keep it. Otherwise it goes back to the store.NOTE: i also have yet to try this out in natural lighting.PROS:*Clarity; this camera, with its 10.1mp is quite nice in comparison to my previous camera, a samsung s600 (@6.1mp). I immediately noticed how much more brighter and clear and defined my pictures came out to be. With flash anyways.*i'm finding the macro option helpful, as well as the steady focus feature.CONS:*Without flash and in lowlight situations, it takes, realllly terrible pictures, with lots of noise, and plenty of blur.*When viewing pictures on it, they take a lot longer to load then they did on my samsung.*I tried out the video recording feature, and unlike my samsung, the mic is absollutely dreadful at picking up sounds. Even if you put it up to a speaker, it's just a faint hint of noise in the background when you play it back.That's it so far...i will update more soon.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cheaper at Walmart", "Author": "A.

It does have its ups and downs, but it is worth it. I admit I did not buy this on amazon, it was a Christmas present from Walmart. But for those of you who are buying online, this is my review: It has easy to use settings: up close for things like flowers (one of my uses, nature), scenery (mountains), and then of course your average photos. A button to turn flash off, and on with no issues. Zoom in and out works great. It even has an \"easy\" setting which simply shows you the battery left, and the number of photos left that you can take, kind of like your easy to use dispossable camera. The battery lasts... well not that long. If your on a long trip make sure your able to charge it every night, that is kind of a problem I know. Also, WARNING, the USB chord for this camera is a unique model, for some reason the company decided to make a chord that stores like walmart and target don't sell because it is so rare, and so few cameras use it. So buyer be aware, take care of your chord unless you want to go spend another $20 on a chord which is what I had to do, in fact i didnt even buy a new chord, i bought a memory chip reader so i could use it with my other electronics.
