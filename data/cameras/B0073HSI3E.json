{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera that does really take better than average pictures!", "Author": "K. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R18EAHT43G84OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am and always have been skeptical of buying digital cameras. This is the cheapest entry and also one of the newest from Nikon that has a CMOS sensor rather than a CCD sensor. Let the argument go on who is better. When the lighting is sun light, the Nikon shines and creates wonderful photos. Low light, of course, is a typical offender of ruining a good picture. If the flash is used, most of the time it does a good job to make everything look natural and not \"over-toned\" in anyway or display odd contrast properties.I think this is a great product and really sells itself when you view the information offered on Nikons web site.5/14/2012 UPDATE : The flash stopped firing. I went through the reference manual and played out all scenarios in which the Flash should fire and it is not. The flash has been deemed defective my Nikon and I have been granted a return authorization. This is upsetting but I hope Nikon can give a quick turn around with my camera or just give me a new unit all together. I really do enjoy the camera when it works!5/24/2012 - 6/12/2012 UPDATE : I finally got the camera back from Nikon, parts hold made it longer than normal. I was quoted in 7-10 business days I would have the camera back and that was not true. 13 business days and a whole lot of horrible communication. I would never buy a Nikon product after the customer \"service\" I received.When my Canon scanner broke, without hesitation, they sent me a new scanner and said stick the old on in the new box and attach the pre-paid shipping label. Said it would take 5-7 days and it arrived in 2 days. Canon > Nikon in customer service department.2/1/2013 UPDATE : Camera still works, takes great pictures, has great battery life. I cannot say a terrible thing about the camera when it works. Yes it was annoying after it broke shortly. Yes, Nikon was over the \"scheduled\" time period of replacement, but it works now and still takes great pictures. They made this one cheaper, recently, so it is even a better buy unless technology did a 180* in some other direction I am not aware of.7/27/2013 UPDATE : Camera still taking great pictures, great battery life, great quality shots when the lighting is there. The only thing that I dislike is what I believe to be the most common fault of all point and shoot cameras which is the low light level pictures tend to lose a bit of quality. Sometimes the automatic color picks the incorrect filter but can you really blame the device when light bulbs come in so many different temperatures now a days? I have three different temperature light bulbs in my house, some share the same room and it can throw off the auto colors, a few quick and painless button selections and you can choose your own color filter to make the picture match the natural colors you are trying to capture. During close up shots, the flash can be a bit over bearing but rarely does this happen.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture quality is good but Battery performance is disappointing and Camera gets hanged sometimes.", "Author": "Raghu", "ReviewID": "R2VCYL4Z4RJSOD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with great expectations on photo quality and image capture options.

Photos can be zoomed in and edited with great clarity.2.Camera Menu Options: It provides wide range of image capture options with plenty of scene selector modes.Cons :1.Battery performance : It is disappointing to see that a fully charged battery can capture only 120 photos. I thought the performance will improve after first few days charging but later realized that it is not very great.2.Cannot access camera when it is charging. It is very frustrating.3. Most important one : My Camera is getting hanged every now and then , I need to remove the battery to make it work again.

My final verdict is I love it and here is why.1. It is user friendly.  I was able to figure out how to use it without using a guide.  Will except for the formatting of my SD card, I had to make a service call for that one. (Service rep was friendly and helpful)  The camera took two good pictures when I first got it, then froze up, and would not take any more pictures. I came to find out it used all of its internal memory and since my SD card was not formatted the camera had no were else to go.  Once I formatted my SD card it worked great.2.  The options.  I like the fact that I can choose to take 16 mb picture down to VGA quality picture. It does the same with the video. It has about 6 different video/ picture gradients to choose from.  The fun features it comes with is well just \"wow\". I love the sepia and all the different scene shots.  I Love the continuous shooting options.  I do have more trouble getting crisp pictures from this, though.3. The video is so amazing. I can hardly believe, that I own a point and shoot camera that takes video at such an amazing quality.  It still blows my mind.  I almost think the price of the camera is worth this feature alone.  And recording is so easy just hit the record button.  Love it, absolutely love it.4. The auto focus mode. It takes really good idiot proof pictures.  Not the auto scene mode just the plain full auto mode.  They are Crisp, vibrant and everything I want in a picture5. 10x optical zoom main reason I bought the camera.  It works great.I researched this camera heavily before I purchased it.  The battery system is not a problem for me because,  [...]  I made this purchase on amazon at the same time.  I now have three batteries and really good recharger.Yes this camera can take terrible pictures. I have taken some, but I would like to know of a camera that doesn't.  All of my bad pictures, I blame on me the photographer and not the camera.  But one of the short comings of this camera, that I have noticed, is that I have gotten a lot red eye shots with the flash.  I did not expect this and have not made the verdict if it is me or the camera, because in my research others have gotten great flash shots without the red eye.Bottom line this camera has met or surpassed all of my expectations and was worth every penny I put into it, and I gladly recommend it to anybody looking for a good point and shoot camera.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pat", "Author": "Pat Nadeau", "ReviewID": "R1OHNZBY2XBAES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is wonderful.

I had looked at numerous cameras before I chose this one.  I wanted with 10x zoom on it.  I like this camera a lot, and it was very easy to use, considering I was not able to test it out before I left on my trip.  I broght the manual with me, just in case I needed to know how do do something, and I never opened it once.  The only con I would give the camera (and I am still not sure if its a con) because I need to use it more, is the battery life.  My battery died during my brother's wedding ceremony, when I needed it the most, and I had to run back to my room to charge the battery.  That might be also because it was the first time I has used the camera on that battery charge.  But that was my only downfall on this camera.

The camera was great for the first 5 days. Picture quality is excellent and the variety of different modes is outstanding. On the 5th day, the lenses protector jammed half opened. Most upsetting. Stopped and ordered a new camera to be delivered to our next stop. Love Amazon. Later in that day, I turned on the camera again and the lenses shutter remained half opened. I poked my finger nail in between the lenses and cover and poof, the lenses shutter opened and has worked perfectly since then, about 30 days so far. So, order the camera, use it, enjoy the 10x zoom, the panorama, various settings and brilliant picture.

Once the camera decides to power up, you do what it's designed to do: \"point and shoot\"...nothing happens...press the shutter once, twice, and maybe a third time before it's warmed up in time to take the shot that now, you've obviously missed. Next, try an action shot with the zoom, the auto focus simply does not work...AT ALL. It continuously hunts and blurs in and out of focus.

This review will be on my old S6300 since its the same camera. I had my old S6300 for almost a year. In that time I took it on almost all family vacations and events. It delivered great results as long as you don't ask too much of it. Which allot of people fail to realize that it is a point and shoot camera not a DSLR....As for photo quality I'd say this camera takes better then average photo's. Noise isn't noticeable at ISO's lower then 1000 which is very good for a point and shoot.Noise at ISO 1600 isn't to bad either, its there but not in any way a distraction. You have ample room the crop photo's and the image sensor seems to have a dynamic range that is about on par with my Nikon D5100. But image quality isn't anywhere near as good. The reason being the image sensor on my D5100 is about three times the size.The S6300 gives good battery life of about 250 shots if you leave the camera in 16mp mode, if you set the camera at 16*mp (best quality) you will average about 200+ shots. Mind you this is not using the flash or reviewing pictures allot. Video mode does eat up battery life. You'll get about 30minutes of battery life in video mode. You'll also fill up an 8gb SDHC card quick if you shoot allot of 1080p videos. Video quality is very good in decent to good light. But in darker conditions it will produce grainy videos which again is to be expected from a point and shoot camera. The stereo microphones produce very clear sound and seem to have good range. However in quiet situations you do hear a bit of background hiss. This camera does have full optical zoom while recording video and the zoom speed is actually decent. Allot of cameras like this resort to digital zoom or they just slow down the zoom speed to try and quiet the sound of the lenses motor. Personally I'd pick a fast zoom speed to ensure I get the subject on video.As for the built in flash it does a great job of lighting dark rooms or areas. It doesn't overexpose or wash out colors too bad. Nikon seems to have this aspect of the S6300 almost dead on.The S6300's focus system is good but not perfect. In lower light it will struggle to find focus unless there is contrast or a clear color difference with the background and subject. Again its a point and shoot.The camera has a good amount of manual features but not too many. It also has a good bit of in camera effects and tools to fix up or change the way your pics look before you upload them to you computer.As for speed its about average. It powers on and is ready to shoot in about 3 seconds. From standby it takes about 4 seconds.Over all I liked the S6300 so much that I bought another one. Its the perfect size weight and has a great 10x zoom lens so you get almost everything you want. I could have gotten the new S6500 but I really don't think its worth it to spend $250+ on a small camera like this. So for the price the S6300 is selling for now I'd snatch one up before they run out of stock.

I got it cause it was a good price, nice design, light, and long optical zoom lens.  I saw some sour reviews on it, but also some really nice ones.  So I decided to go with the nice ones.  But one thing that should have been apparent to me right away was that the screen to too low-res so you have no idea what quality the videos and pictures are that you are shooting until you pull them up on your computer.  One nice thing about videos is that you can pause recording and resume rather than having to stop and start again if you are going to do another video a minute later or moments later and don't want excess footage.  However there are several bad things I experienced with the video function. If you record video constantly for more that a few minutes the picture totally looses focus and blurs out completely and you have no choice but to start another video.  If you try to use digital zoom on video it gets very blurred zoomed all the way. On all my videos there was at least one or more random little dots of light.  That's just unacceptable, it ruined videos at an event I recorded for family.  Also if you are indoors the video is way too fuzzy.  I understand that's normal, it reacts to artificial light, but it shouldn't be this much.Finally, the pictures aren't always that great, the light fill, and compensation aren't too great all the time.As far as how long it takes between taking pictures..This is a 16mp camera so you really do need a class 6 or 10 sd card.Overall this camera was just too good to be true.  I could not ignore all the defects and flaws.

Between my wife and daughter each camera was damaged and became unusable. For the price it was purchased it was much cheaper to buy the next version for the same price of the previous.  I chose the s6300 a second time without flinching.  Compared to Canon, Panasonic, Fuji, Sony, and others this model has the best optical zoom.  I do not count digital zoom as an option due to decreased picture quality on every camera.To sum the above up.: the Nikon s6300 out performed any previous Nikon model.

Trying to understand the content of the manual for any tech product is comparable to having a root canal for me.  To avoid as much frustration as possible, I referred only to the Quick Start Guide. I started out by charging the battery.  In the Guide it distinctly says to charge it until the blinking light goes off, which will take approximately 3 hours and 50 minutes.  Sure enough, the blinking light turned off after approximately that time.  So I assumed that the battery was fully charged, and proceeded to take a couple of pictures.  At least I knew that I could not take more than that without first buying a memory card, but I wanted to try it out anyhow. Then I tried to delete the pictures, but was unable to do so no matter how many times I followed the exact instructions in the Guide. Out of frustration, I called Nikon tech support and explained the problem.  The tech lady said that she would send me a link to download the manual, even though I repeatedly told her I was following what it said in the Guide.  Very helpful advise, yes?  No!  I then tried to download the View NX2 Installer program which consists of three modules.  As soon as I stated the installation, I got a message indicating that I had to use a newer version of the program by going to the Nikon site.  I did that, but I still don't have any idea if all three modules were downloaded properly.  I still hadn't solved the problem of deleting the pictures I took, so I Googled the problem (yes folks, I do use the internet out of necessity) and read someplace in the mass of information that the battery needs to be charged overnight.  I did that, and was then able to delete the pictures.  I will now use the camera but only in fully Auto mode, because I would never be able to figure out all of the other modes, menus, and sub-menus.  I will also not call the Nikon tech people because I would probably be sent another link to download the manual.

I, an avid photographer, navigated through a lot of reviews of options within his price range, and settled on this (Nikons are also my personal fave, which also nudged us towards this one). Out of the box, I loved that it was easy for him to understand and learn his way around. He can turn it on, zoom, autofocus and take pics, and navigate through the basic settings on his own, keep an eye on the battery, and get it charged on his own when need be. The small size made it easy for his small hands to hold securely and steadily, an the metal body made it a sturdy option for a child. Some of his pics come out blurry, but I chalk that up to him not yet having a grasp on how to shoot for nice, crisp stuff. I can get decent shots with it--mind you nothing like my Nikon D7000, my own camera--but of satisfactory quality for someone who just wants accurate, depandable shots with a handful of bells and whistles on an easily totable and user-friendly camera at a price that doesn't break the bank. Granted, if you want a serious camera for artst high-hobby stuff, you might want to look at something more designed for that, like a good SLR, but for basic point-and-shoot, non-serious stuff, this is a sturdy, easygoing choice that was a good buy. I eally love the simplicity and dependability of it; my kid never had to track me down and ask for help, and can carry and care for it on his own without me having to drop what I'm doing to fuss with it for him. If it's sturdy, light, and easy-to-use in the hands of a six-year-old, I assume prettymuch anyone will find it simple, sturdy, and easy to drag anywhere.

We wanted better than a (NON-smart phone) cell phone quality pictures, so we bought this camera.We had several problems and within 6 months had to go back to another Sony.  We found that while it took great still shots, it had the following issues.1.  The battery included with the camera would not hold a charge for more than about 30 pictures without flash (10 with flash) or a 1 min video.2.  Any movement would blur the image (not great shutter speed).3.  The response time when taking pictures was about a half second to a full second (most of the time longer than shorter)  from when pushing the button to when the picture was taken.  This caused a LOT of missed pictures.4.  The multi picture per second was not a reality.

I chose this Nikon because of the full HD settings, and true to Nikon form, the colors are incredible!  I gave it a four out of five because I don't believe it has a stabilizing feature, which when shooting hand held footage, this is difficult.  Also, the autofocus while in video mode is pretty picky.I'm not a fan of the photos.  It always looks a bit off.  The colors and exposure are always unnatural, and even when I try to correct in photoshop, I can never get the look I want.  Let's be honest, I would much rather use my DSLR for photos.

So far it seems that the pictures have nice resolution and I have been pleased with the results in a variety of situations.  I can't tell if it's a function of the on-camera screen or the way the pictures are being taken, but in some of the pictures the color balance seems a bit off.  When taking pictures in a museum, I found it necessary to turn the \"exposure\" way way down so that the pictures wouldn't look super washed out (I was not using flash to avoid reflection on the exhibit cases).  Sometimes the antishake doesn't seem to work as well as my old camera (a Panasonic Lumix from 2009).  So overall, I'm not overawed by it but it seems to be performing reasonably well.

CAMERA DOES NOT FOCUS IN THE MACRO MODE. WILL NOT EVEN ALLOW THE SHUTTER TO BE PRESSED because the camera will not focus. Simply put...the camera is defective. I received the camera back on May 2nd 2013 and phoned right away to let them know it was not working. They promised to send shipping labels ASAP. 5 CALLS LATER I STILL DON'T HAVE THE SHIPPING LABLES. Phoned again today and am to have the labels by 8pm tonight. Amazing, they can send me emails with promotions of stuff to purchase all day long yet can't get a return label out to me.Shipping this camera back today April 17th 2013.

Last person gave it a go for a good amount of time, finally said it is a bit of junk take it back. Followed the instruction book lined up everything and had the green lights flashing as noted in the instruction book yet it still would not focus. I don't know if it is just this one camera but wanted to ad my 2 cents worth incase there is others out there experiencing the same problems. I have been carrying around two cameras to the job, my old one for close-ups and the 6300 for all other pictures.

The second battery is holding up OK, and I am used to the camera. But, if I had known there was a wifi version to be released  so soon, I would have waited a couple months and purchased that one instead.I'm adding to my original review below. While I am not thrilled with this camera I'm relatively sure the problem was the battery that the camera shipped with.  I am still having a problem with the camera deleting images that I intended to keep, and don't find the controls intuitive; perhaps if I used the camera daily I would begin to remember how to navigate, but I am finding the menu frustrating. Wish I had not purchased it online.Original review: The coolpix worked fine the first 2 times I used it. A couple months went by (with the camera safely stored in my home) and I tried to use the camera yesterday - I got the message that the battery was exhausted.  I charged the battery per the instructions in the manual and now the camera will not even turn on! I reviewed the charge procedure and I had not made any errors.  I then tried to set up a return since it is totally USELESS if the brand new battery will not charge. Amazon's return window expired a month after I got the camera.  What's with that? So I guess I am stuck. I researched cameras in this price range carefully before I made a decision.  I obviously made the WRONG decision and bought it from the WRONG supplier.

The camera is very small and very cheaply made with a plastic feel to it. The absolute worst is that it is not compatible with MacIntosh computers or iPhoto. You have to waste a half an hour downloading a special Nikon software, and even then it will not recognize a connection with a USB cable!! In fact, it's even stated in the user's manual: \"Connecting The USB Cable: The connection may not be recognized if the camera is connected to the computer via a USB hub.\" WHAT?! Isn't that the primary purpose of a digital camera - to be able to connect it to a computer and simply upload the photos?Please be warned: THIS CAMERA IS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. Run don't walk away from Coolpix. If you look online, people have written about all sorts of models numbers under this brand and they all have trouble simply uploading photos. Ridiculous.Another negative is that the Nikon \"help line\" has a constant busy signal. A help line with a busy signal? Really?

I do not like the buttons or the screen it seems like a basic junk camera, i dont like that its not a touchscreen. The  pictures were clear at first then the color just don't look right, whenever i take a pic it looks foggy and dim not at all what i expected for a 2012 model maybe for  2002 it looks modern but the functions are old seems like a junky camera.UPDATE: This camera took horrible pictures outside, they were super dark. i could not get the lighting good on the pictures, but you just have to keep playing with the settings to get it right, also the delete all option is so easy to hit by mistake it deleted all my pictures that i could not get back i dont like that at all. but after i played with the settings i found it does take some pretty good pictures with alot of detail.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor\n10x Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens\n2.7-inch bright LCD\nFull HD (1080p) Movies with Stereo Sound", "Name": "Nikon COOLPIX S6300 16 MP Digital Camera with 10x Zoom NIKKOR Glass Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41x0GqDUiTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0073HSI3E"}}
