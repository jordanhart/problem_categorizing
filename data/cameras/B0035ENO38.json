{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent little camera for the $!  Awesome if your Cell takes MicroSD", "Author": "Alicia Jaromin \"lunaemica\"", "ReviewID": "R1RADQMYJOS1M9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had it for about a week and love it so far.  Takes great pics and has several nice features.My Favorite feature: if your cell phone takes MicroSD cards then you can pop the card from the camera into your cell phone and upload pics to Facebook, text or email them right away.  This is great if you have family/friends that aren't nearby and you want them to feel like they are.Other great features:The sketch mode is so cool, Very fun to play with.  I played with the miniature mode as well but didn't have the right kind of shots to make it fun.The LCD on the front is a Godsend for any Mom who has a thousand pics of her kids but none with her in them.The camera is so small it's sure to be brought with you when you go out and not left at home...it is literally the size of my Smartphone.Lots of options...2 basic settings for novices while the P mode there are options to play with if you're a little more daring.Multi-shot option (in the P mode) is great for outdoors photos when you're hoping to catch 'that pitch' or a particular moment....love that it will take unlimited photos until you run out of card space!Haven't played much with the video mode yet...kind of bummed that the highest fps is in the smallest resolution but happy that it saves in a usable format!A few minor complaints/issues:The rear screen is a bit hard to see in bright light (even with the auto brightness) but it's not a major issue for me...I'm used to a tilt screen in the back to combat this issue.It doesn't come with a separate charger so you have to charge the batteries in the camera..I just bought an extra external charger.The ports for the USB are proprietary so you can't just use any cord...kind of a bummer since they easily could have used the microUSB cables.It doesn't come with cables to connect to the TV or HDMI so you'd have to purchase these (proprietary ends) if you wanted to use that feature.The camera battery that it comes with is horribly underpowered and doesn't last hardly at all (not an issue if you get 2 batteries or a higher power battery).The children mode has the flash disabled automatically...super bummer as most of my shots are indoors.  You have to re-enable the flash each time you switch into this mode.  It should auto-remember the flash setting or allow you to set it IMHO.I wish that you could upload a different video for the children mode...there are some online videos you can change it with but if you could put your own video in there (like Elmo or whatever the child's favorite character is) that would be amazing.Extras to purchase with the device:There's an aftermarket battery (Zeikos) that is 1600 MAh that works great...the batteries for the TL225 (SLB-07A) do work in this camera so I'd suggest getting another battery.I'd also suggest getting a class 6 MicroSD card for it as the access time is great and if you have kids you want to save the pic to the camera as quick as possible so you can catch the next photo.Anyway, WONDERFUL product FOR THE MONEY and with a few minor tweaks it could be the best camera ever....that being said I'm glad I bought it and plan to update this review as I go.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Lindsay", "ReviewID": "R3W59DETG6HB6K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very late review, but I guess that makes it a better one lol.
