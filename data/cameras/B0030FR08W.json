{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great deal, but you've gotta work for it", "Author": "Pat Denoli", "ReviewID": "R3438DQAMXHH0W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm usually pretty good with bad English translations in my instruction manuals, but this product is pretty rough.  You often can't tell if the manual is telling you that something needs to be done in order to make something happen, that it shouldn't be done if you want it to happen... or if you need to make the second thing happen (some other way) in order for the first thing to be taken care of.  Use of negatives and double-negatives is a challenge, too.  If you are familiar with the configuration of network gear, try to forget what you know.  It doesn't work *exactly* the same with this camera.  You're better off as a novice, I think.Since it burned 15 hours of my time, here's a possible help for some people about to return their camera because \"wireless isn't working\".  This is for people who manually assign IPs, or who don't understand why the camera isn't finding any wireless networks.  Understand that the camera has to be set it up in very specific stages.  You can't make all your changes at once.  Also, you must use the proprietary software to connect to the camera over Ethernet the first time. Don't use other software. Make sure you set your router for dynamic IP allocation.  Next, you reboot through software.  Next you power cycle.  Log into the camera using IE.  It says you can use other browsers, but don't.  NOW set up the wireless properties.  Save them, remove the ethernet cable.  Reboot through software and then power cycle (yes, that's two boots).  Log in again.  NOW change the IP assignment from dynamic to manual.  Save and reboot through software and then power cycle.  You won't find these instructions in the manual.  I had to stumble upon it and I've repeated the process with minor variations to be sure - nothing else works.  Good grief!!!!!!!  I was about to pack these things up and ship them back.  Looks like they work fine if you know the right dance.  I'm using 128 bit WEP.  If you're using something else - good luck to you.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "My Opinion", "ReviewID": "R2TH9ATJW8RFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little concerned after reading all of the posts complainingabout how hard their experiences were in setting up this camera.Aside from that, the ratings were good, the price was right, and sinceI have 20 years IT experience and am a glutton for punishment,  Iordered one.  Actually I need at least three, but I wanted to buy oneas a test, and if it passed, I'd buy the additional two cameras.I ordered this camera and several days later it was already in mymailbox.  I unpacked it, and was going to put off configuring it untilChristmas day, when I would have had much of the day to play with it.Being the workaholic that I am, I decided to go ahead and try andconfigure it within minutes of deciding I wasn't going to do it.  Igot out the instruction book and started going through the steps, oneby one.  The grammar kind of bothered me, you can tell Englishwasn't a native language for the technical document writer.  I'm notgoing to lie, you're going to need a bit of technical experience toget this camera connected, but it's not the camera's fault.  With allthe security that's around nowadays, along with all the possible setupscenarios, it's likely never going to be a plug and play scenario toget an IP camera working. I'll bottom line you though  - it was worthit.  I love this thing!My first bit of advice is to take the instruction book that's insidethe box, and put it directly into your trash can. Seriously.  Thatbook is flawed and you're going to need the Hubble Telescope to readthe small print to begin with. Follow the manual on the CD that's inthe box.  There are guides on the CD. One is a User Manual PDF and theother is a quick guide.  Follow the User Manual for it's a bit moredetailed.  Now let me describe my equipment and the steps I took toget this camera configured.  My equipment: Linksys Wireless Router, PCrunning Windows XP Pro SP3, Cable Mode for Internet connection.If you want this thing to email you photos when the motion sensor istripped (or to connect to it via the Internet, which is why you'relooking at an IP camera to begin with), then you're going to need anInternet connection.  You'll need at least a Cable modem.  I can'timagine how slow it will be if you have DSL and you're trying toconnect to this camera over the Internet.  So, I've got a Cable modem,Linksys wireless router, and a NON SSL POP email account.  YOU CANNOTUSE GMAIL WITH THE CURRENT FIRMWARE WITH THIS CAMERA.  Gmail requiresSSL and the SMTP client on this camera as of today is not written forSSL, so save yourself some time in trying to do it anyway.  Unless youuse STunnel from [...], it's just not going to happen.  Since Ihave several email accounts, I simply chose one that I knew didn'trequire SSL (it's a hosted account I have with Rochen, with gives youthe option to use their non SSL SMTP port 1025 which will work with this camera, or to use the more common Secure SMTP like that of Gmail which won't work with this camera.)Quick steps of what I did:Step 1: Screw the antenna into the camera. Plug the network cable intothe camera and then into an available port on your wireless router.Plug the power cable into the wall and then into the camera.Step 2: Now on your computer, which is also running through yourrouter, run the IP Camera tool from the CD, but first make sure youexit any web browsers you may have open.  You may have to reboot yourcomputer after the IP Camera Tool installation.Step 3:  You should be reading through the User Manual at this point,as there are many possibilities for your current setup.  You shouldhave also already thrown the printed manual into your trash can whereit rightfully belongs. Run the IP Cameral Tool icon from the desktopif you had to reboot your computer.  Your camera should show up inthat list as anonymous, followed by[...]  Personally, I'm running DHCP soan IP was already assigned to the camera when it booted.  If youdouble click on the IP address of the camera in the IP Camera Toolwindow, it will bring up a web browser window for you to login to thecamera.  The default username is admin with a blank password (thispart is not in that stupid printed manual that came in the box withthe camera..but luckily you threw it in the trash.)Step 4: This is important: save yourself some grief and use InternetExplorer to get this thing setup. You can play around with Firefox andother browsers all you want later, but for sake of simplicity, justuse IE for now.  Since you're using IE you'd use the first set oflogin parameters on the login page.Step 5: Now that you are logged in, you should see an Active X requestso go ahead and right click and install it.  Then you may need to runan additional app that pops up before you can see the video stream.Step 6: Hey wow!  There you are in the video if  you've got it pointedat yourself.  So far so good. I played around a bit at this point,panning the camera left, right, up, down..pretty nice! Cut out thelights...yep..can still see me in the dark...except now I've got bigdevilish pupils.  Now you need to configure all of the settings underadministrator (on the bottom left of the screen).You need to decide how you will get to the camera over the Internet.I've got a DynDNS account, but it's a whole lot more easy to just useport forwarding on my router.  So I picked an available port, gave itsome random name, and pointed that port to the fixed IP of the camera. You'll also need to be sure you get all of your settings deadaccurate correct, otherwise your wireless won't work.  Make sure yourSSID is correct, your Auth Key is correct, Encryption type, etc. etc.If just one thing is wrong, you won't be able to go wireless.  Forcertain settings in your camera, it may need to reboot thecamera..kind of annoying but it is what it is.  Once you get all ofyour wireless settings correct, you can remove the network cable fromthe back of the camera.  Your camera should still show up in the IPCamera Tool window.  If not, you did something wrong.  If so,  you'renow ready to go wireless.  To test, I used:[...] :AssignedPortIUsed  Works great!Regarding the email: because of the poor use of English, when you areputting in SMTP server account settings (if you chose to have it emailyou pictures when motion trips the alarm) then BE SURE YOU CLICKSUBMIT AFTER YOU ENTER ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND BEFORE BEFORE BEFORE**BEFORE** YOU CLICK ON \"TEST\".  The camera will not take the settingsuntil you click on SUBMIT.  So make sure you SUBMIT before you TEST.I got hung up on this for about 30 minutes of KNOWING my settings werecorrect, but couldn't figure out why the camera said it couldn'tconnect to my account. I even did the whole Telnet routine to connectmanually to the SMTP port because I knew my settings were correct.CLICK SUBMIT BEFORE YOU TEST.Regarding the motion alarm: I used the scheduling for the motion alarmto trip when I'm at work...so I put in my work schedule. No one shouldbe walking around inside my home while I'm not there. If they do, I'vegot them on video straight to my cell phone, in which case I'dpromptly call the police.Well, that's about it for me.  It works great.  Also, as one of thereceiving email accounts, I wanted to mention that you can use youremail to text with your cell phone company (I have tmobile, so it's[...] ) so now when the motion is trippedon your camera, it will send the pictures via SMS text to your cellphone.  I can't say enough good things about this camera. I just hopeit stands the test of time..and maybe I'll come back and do a followup review in a few months.Have fun!

You can read on the differences between the -08(old) and the -18 versions on the Foscam site, but they relate to effectiveness of the IR beams, quality of motion detection, and location of some of the lights, LEDs and lack of PIN settings.Now, assuming you purchased from Foscam directly, if you go to the Foscam forums you will learn that their newer model, the -18W model, has a problem with the audio so bad that you have to open the unit and remove and re-solder on a new resistor to fix it.

Then you enter in the wireless settings and it reboots and comes back up (after removing the hard wire during the boot up process) trying to connect on the wireless settings.  Well I had my port forwarding set up to the assigned IP address of the camera for the hard wired connection.  When it comes up using the wireless connection, it is assigned a different IP.

I have to say, for the price it is fantastic. the machine is completely silent when it pans and tilts. the mic and speaker are sub par, but video recording is the only reason im getting it. you can listen and talk through it, but expect to only have a conversation with someone really close to the camera, and the mic/speaker array causes a bit of feedback and noise when talking through it. the wall mount is great, the material \"rubberized plastic\" feels great and its a bit heavier than i anticipated. with WIFI and LAN NICs the device can be places almost anywhere. I wish it has some onboard storage or it could record mp4s to a shared drive on a server. FTP support is not all that great, it seems to just save frames. if you run it in IE with active x the stream can be record WITH SOUND to the local machine in a designated folder in a mp4 format. I really like that feature but i dont want to have another desktop machine running all the time. server integration would be the best. but, its only a $75 ip camera. something slightly frustrating is the onboard motion detection. It it a bit tricky to tune right, and you cant set an area to monitor. and it seems like motion detect doesn't work while panning. (that would be cool but understandably not supported). motion detect trips an alarm event, that can be scheduled. scheduler seems buggy but works. after motion even camera records for 1 minute, not just until object leaves frame. Noes not record previous or buffered frames before alarm. but all of these issues are remedied with Zoneminder. all in all, awesome hard ware for $75. i dont think anyone looking for a decent IP camera would be disappointed with this one. glad i got one, looking at getting some more FOSCAM stuff.I will post some more videos and setup details about it in the near future at T3CHKOMMIE.com", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value for the Money", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "R2OTB7P5OR895G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a lot of gripes about this camera, but I do believe it is worth every penny.  1.

There are several iphone apps which let me control it while I'm out and about.  The night vision works fairly well too.

Once you solve the basic networking issues, the rest of the features are easy to configure. A few tips I learned.- Camera can automatically e-mail you when its IP address changes (most likely due to a new dynamic IP address being assigned from your ISP).- Camera is specifically enabled to work with Hotmail. If you give the camera an account and you have an account, you can \"chat\" with it via Messenger (Messenger,which is associated with Hotmail, must be installed on your PC). If you send the chat message, \"url?\" the camera responds with its current full IP address. So, if you want to see the camera from a remote location, chat with it and then use the IP address it gives you to access the camera.- For some reason, I was able to see the live video feed from my iPad without giving a password. I don't get this. Perhaps safari in the iPad stored the password. The same does not occur with my regular MAC and safari.- When you do enter the password, my browser indicates is is being sent \"unencrypted.\" Potential issue?- A temperature sensor built into the camera would be a good addition.I need several cameras and will buy a CISCO camera and try it. My primary reasons for trying another brand: 1) poor documentation; and 2) potential security issues--I want to stress that I do not know whether there is an issue.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its ok as long as its 12 inches from the router", "Author": "Catheryne", "ReviewID": "R2G46YB6I94NKC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First the camera can't be very far from the router.

Some users had a hard time figuring it out. Others said the instructions were unclear. Some didn't like the image quality. All I can say is that it only took me about an hour to set it up. That is mainly because it just takes that long to get set up and do anything. When the controller software asked for User and Password I didn't read the instructions. You are supposed to type \"admin\" for the user and leave the password blank. For wireless operation you will need to know your router ID and password. Not too bad. You need to know that when you install any wireless device with a router. The rest is a breeze. It works perfectly. The quality is beyond what I expected, especially for the price. The motors are quiet and the operation is smooth. The resolution is 640x480 (low but good). That's how it's designed, so why all of the user complaints? If you go to another computer and type the IP address of the camera into the browser you are prompted to run an activeX controller that gives you control of the camera remotely. Nice! I like this camera and wish I had bought a couple more. It was easy to install and it's easy to use.Additional Comments:When I went out of range of my router I found that a whole new set of problems occur. The software stops working. You need to do port forwarding or have the IP address managed by a host site since the IP address of the router isn't static. I got it setup through a host and it lasted about 2 weeks. The camera went off line or maybe it went rogue, but I can't find it. I don't want to set it up every 2 weeks, so mine will become part of the landfill.

The Foscam website was of little help, but said be wary of counterfeit units on Amazon.  I contacted the distributer who shipped the unit, and it was exchanged very rapidly.

Well I was wrong...  The instructions are very difficult to follow, are not clear in what order to do things, and it feels as though it was originally written in a different language and was poorly translated.  With that said (and downloading the user manual of the foscam website) I was finally able to setup this camera.  The image quality seems decent and the 360 panning control is pretty cool.  The web user interface leaves a lot to be desired, but it's manageable.  I primarily bought this to view the camera from my iPhone as indicated in the description, but all that means is you are able to pull up the exact same web interface in safari.  So if you want to see a 2x2 image, then they are correct that it supports viewing on the iPhone.  In terms of the two way audio, it requires you to plug the camera into a microphone and speaker system which seems somewhat deceptive.  Other than that I think the unit itself is well made hardware.

In this case the manual is not only very poorly written with respect to English, but also lacks a lot of information that the user needs to get the system working.  If I were to give an award for the worst instruction manual I've ever had, this would be be the grand prize winner.

Do yourself a favor and use Internet Explorer.Pros:-Great value for the price-Picture Quality is Better than Expected-Easy to Set-up-Great rotation and controlsI would definitely buy several of these cameras.  The price is right and the quality is very good.  Again, if you are concerned with good audio both income and outgoing this is not the right camera for you.  If you are worried picture quality, ease of use, and set-up it is a very good product.

The hardware seems fine, but I soon found out that the software is severely lacking. There are two web interfaces available. The primary one is ActiveX, so it only works on Windows (and it crashed the browser on Windows 7 64-bit, so not even all Windows versions work). The other interface is just annoying to use. The whole interface seems very outdated and clunky and not very reliable.The worst part is that no matter what I did I could not get it to connect to my wireless network. I have an Apple Airport Extreme Base Station which I have had no problems with using any other device, but this one just would not join the network. I worked with the manufacturer's tech support for over a week trying all kinds of things (turning on SSID broadcast, tweaking security settings, upgrading firmware, etc.), but nothing worked. It just refuses to recognize my network. After over a week I was just tired of messing with it, so I'm going to return it.I strongly suggest that you avoid this camera unless you are willing to risk not having wireless support or possibly spending a lot of time fussing with it to get it to work.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Carolina F.", "ReviewID": "R1VQ0T0B7V8SC7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I dont installed it yet , when i isntall it i tell you if i like it or not ..", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "defective", "Author": "benji", "ReviewID": "R1271ASJVAJCGF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is fine but came defective as the motion sensor did not function.
