{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice camera, but far from perfect", "Author": "Tom the Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1SLLW6J2GKEP8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let's be honest - I bought this camera specifically for the waterproof/dustproof/crushproof/freezeproof features. I anticipated that image quality and ease of operation might be sacrificed - and this is exactly what Olympus delivered. Additional questionable bonus is the \"tap\" feature, which allows to activate some of the functions by tapping the camera from the sides. This is a nice concept, but would be much more useful if it was reconfigurable and allowed the user to assign which functions are activated by tapping. The most important (at least for me) feature of this camera is that it's waterproof, and I can honestly admit that it works. I used this camera for a couple of hours while playing around in the swimming pool, and it worked beautifully. No leaks, no bubbles, and color correction for underwater photography is quite decent. The crushproof feature was also tested, since I dropped the camera couple of times, and it kept working. This camera is tough :)  Unfortunately the image quality is far from perfect, in fact is merely average for a point-and-shooter.The good:- waterproof and crushproof (tested!)- good color representation- good automatic white balance (AWB)- built-in panorama mode (only 3 frames)The bad:- images lack sharpness, appear very \"soft\"- poor low light operation (focusing)- occasional focusing issues (focuses in center even in \"face detect\" mode)- some operation modes (\"scenes\") are inconsistent, e.g. \"portrait\" mode switches focusing to \"point\" instead of \"face detect\"- flash is too strong and there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust it- the image stabilization doesn't seem to help - consider it non-existent- heavy (but this is kind of expected)- tap control not reconfigurableThe ugly:- weird \"ghosting\" and flaring effects appearing in photos on some occasions when the flash was used (poor or no antireflective coatings on lenses)- very poor sound quality in moviesBottom line - if not for the \"tough\" part, this would have been a pretty average, all-around, point-and-shooter. If you need a true waterproof (not just \"splash proof\") camera or something that you can carry in your pocket or a backpack in all weather conditions or any situation that could otherwise damage your camera - this is the one to get. If you don't need the \"tough\" part - get another camera with better image quality.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Sanguinius", "ReviewID": "R8HR8WD3Z6EIA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*update* here are the pictures from the vacation! [...]all taken using the olympus tough 8000.During this vacation I would say it got dropped and knocked around from about 5 feet to the ground on many handoffs and had a few rough spots but still worked wonderfully.  As you can see some of the panoroma shots came out amazing!  check the ones on top of the mountain from around pictures 100+.  I did realize though that using the automated panorama mode did not work too well so alot of the time it had to be done manually using the second panorama option which lets you setup where the pictures end and start.  Also I would HIGHLY recomend taking the time to learn how to use the little +/- button when you are in camera mode.  Auto works alot but sometimes not how you would like it so that mode lets you decide what you want.  Further while I did not use it underwater persay I did jump into a steam vent and the camera still shot amazing afterwards.  Had to be around 110+ and the water just condensed on the screen but nothing inside thankfully.  Also in terential downpours it took some nice shots, you can see the rain drops!*end update*I read the first review which seemed a bit off as I saw it on other sites (maybe they're registed on a few) so I wanted to post my own.Well I am going on a vacation of a lifetime to hawaii and I figured why not pull out all the stops and buy a top of the line waterproof camera.  Basically also a camera that I could put through the ringer without worrying about dropping it in sand, taking into a waterfall and one that could take some nice pictures.First off I am using the M+ cards that olympus makes you buy.  I read somewhere that to take videos that have a duration longer then 10 seconds or for panorama pictures you need one (can anyone prove me wrong?).  Little dissapointed at that so no 5 stars.Secondly the panorama mode is probally one of the nicest features I have ever had the pleasure of messing around with.  I can literally take a picture of my whole backyard and look at it in one picture (three pictures stitched together).  Does it all in  camera and it is very nice.I have not tested it in the ocean yet so I will get back to everyone on that.  The camera has a beauty mode which I can actually say works very nice.  It shows you what the picture looks like before it touches it up and then after the touchup which is quite a difference (and nice).One problem that I have noticed are night shots which looks slightly grainy.  Im taking the picture in 12m mode with fine resolution, so each shots is around 3900x2900 (off the top of my head I know thats not exact) checking in at about 4mb a shot.  So it might be that on my 1600x1200 monitor it is zoomed in a bit too much, but still slightly dissapointing.  So again no 5 stars.The LCD screen really is quite nice.  I was fiddling around with it outside in direct sunlight and I could see the screen very clearly.  No fidgeting to cover it with my hand at all, it all showed up nicely.  The auto mode works nice just like any other camera and the P mode works if you want to fiddle with some of the other options.  I'll try tap control out sometime and let you know how that works.  Also I do not know of any hosting sites so someone point me to one and I will setup some of the pictures I have taken for your own insights.Overall I like the camera tremendously so far.  Takes amazing panorama pictures, daytime pictures are fantastic.  Night shots look a bit grainy but that might be from my ineptitude.  Camera is also very nice to hold and just feels sturdy.  4 outta 5 without a doubt.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pictures Grainy, Olympus Proprietary Stuff, etc. makes this a drag...", "Author": "RL \"RustyTheGeek\"", "ReviewID": "R1U40PRIPUFV3A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned many digital cameras since '97 when they were first emerging.  Other than a Kodak DC-25 (I think), the first several cameras I owned (and loved) were Olympus.  They were well designed, versatile and they took great pictures.  Unfortunately, Olympus went from one dedicated lackluster memory format (Smartmedia) to an even worse dedicated memory format (xD).  This chased me away from Olympus and into Canon which has been a great camera ever since and I have owned several Canons, SLR and small PAS models.  More on that in a minute...When I tried this Olympus Tough 8000, I was excited to get back into Olympus.  Unfortunately, they are even more proprietary than before.  The USB cable is Olympus Proprietary and it also must be used to charge the camera since there is no seperate charger included.  (So much for charging the extra proprietary battery pack while using the camera!)  There is no media included with the camera but there is an adapter that will allow the user to use MicroSD cards.  (This is what tempted me to try Olympus again.)  Unfortunately they punish you for not using xD media by not allowing the Panoramic feature to work and the higher res videos are limited to 10 sec unless you use xD media.  So you end up buying xD media anyway.The pictures, I am sad to report, are not great taken indoors.  They have a lot of noise even after tinkering with the settings and using the flash.  While I am a technical guy, I don't want to spend lots of time fiddling with the camera when I am goofing off just to get an acceptable shot.  I just want to shoot the thing and get something usable.  If I wanted to fiddle, I'd use a Canon AE Program SLR and carry a light meter.  I don't mind engaging fill flash or using manual settings but in general, I want the thing to be suitable for \"mom-use\" or \"grandpa-use\".  The video clips from this camera are terrible.  They are jerky and hard to hear the audio.  Don't even bother.  The Olympus menus were OK but not as easy as the Canon even though I am a bit BIASed here.So, for $400 or so, Olympus gives you no xD media and no battery charger, just a camera charger.  The thin strap that comes with the camera is the same one they use on other cameras.  The pictures are so-so and the videos are jerky and hard to hear.If you compare this Olympus Tough 8000 to a Canon D-10, you will find the reviews are much more consistently good and the few negatives are less significant.  I got a D-10 and the pictures are better along with the strap being much more beefy.  I got a typical seperate Canon battery charger and the USB cable is a standard USB mini plug.  The Canon D-10 uses SD Media so that is a big plus for me.FYI: All Canon menus are easy to use and intuitive (and consistent over time) and the Canon cameras all use standard memory, either CF (SLR) or SD (PAS).  The USB cables on Canons are standard USB, not proprietary.  The seperate chargers that come in the box with all Canons are all similar in nature (compact with folding plugs) even they are made for whatever battery is used by that particular camera.While the Canon D-10 is a bit oddly shaped, they have enclosed the 3x optical zoom completely in the housing so there are no exposed moving parts.  The pictures are much better indoors and out and it's easier (for me anyway) to make adjustments on the fly.  The videos created by this camera are MUCH better than the Olympus and about the same as other Canon PAS cameras with maybe just a little more background sound from the user.  The videos play smooth and the sound is still good enough.  The telephoto buttons are a little hard to get used to since I am accustomed to using the little zoom ring found on other Canon PAS models.Verdict... Get the Canon D-10 for about $75 less money and have a better camera, plus buy less expensive memory and avoid buying a seperate charger when you get an extra battery.  The one thing I did buy from Olympus after returning the Tough 8000 was the Olympus Floating Strap.  I'll put it on the Canon to keep it afloat.

I was backpacking for a year in Asia and needed something more durable for all the abuse it was going to take.  This one did the trick.

I could throw it in my day pack and never have to think about it getting wet, crushed, sat on, scratched, etc.  I even dropped it off the top of a waterfall in India (by accident) it smashed off a rock and into the pool below, my friend climbed down and got it and after a little shake to get off the water I took a picture of him - worked like a charm!Two little criticisms you should know:1. There is no viewfinder only the LCD screen.  So if you are trying to take a shot on a really sunny day you might just see your own reflection in the LCD and have to guess that you got what you were pointing at.  (The good thing is with the SHQ setting on, if you need to zoom and crop later you've got the pixels to do it.)2. I did have a problem with water leakage once when I jumped into the ocean from a boat.  I think it was two things I did wrong, the force of hitting the water might have been too much for the seals, and two I didn't soak/rinse it in freshwater before opening it to change the memory cards.  In the future I'll have someone hand me the camera after I jump in so no high pressure water exposure, and I'll rinse off the salt before opening it up.

The one drawback is the camera is so small that sometimes with the underwater shots, it's hard to stablize the camera and a finger shows up in the corner of the picture.

I wanted an underwater camera really bad, so I bought it anyways.The images are very sharp and the color is great. Because I use this as a quick point and shoot, I leave the camera in iAUTO mode and am very happy with the results. I have had the camera for six weeks now and have used it in swimming pools and in the ocean every day for two weeks. The underwater pictures are great and really fun. The video mode on this camera is decent for a point and shoot.  It is not as good as a video camera, but then I am not carrying around another waterproof video camera. The only draw back is the finish of the camera. It is really nice looking, and it also scratches really easily. For a \"Tough\" camera, I wish the finish was as tough. The one thing I have to remember when being around the water is to keep water drops off the lens (causes blurry images) and mini air bubbles away from the lens while underwater (flip camera upside down to rid the bubbles).

It worked pretty much as advertised.The camera is waterproof to 33 ft. A \"CAUTION DEPTH\" warning appeared on the screen at about 25 ft. as I was free diving on the wreck of the Rhone. You can turn on the manometer and record the depth at which each photo is taken.I swam and snorkeled with it every day for over a week and never had any issues with the water. It takes great snapshot quality photos. I can't scuba with it, but it goes about as deep as I want to free dive. I highly recommend adding the floating strap to keep it from sinking to the bottom in deep water. The strap keeps the 8000 afloat in both salt and fresh water.I was a little disappointed with the panorama mode. The Olympus software is limited in the number of shots it can stitch together on the camera and it often joined them in the wrong places. Not a major issue for me since I can create the panoramas on my computer if I want to. But I wouldn't give the camera 5 stars here.The camera seems to be sturdily built and has survived being dropped on concrete multiple times from heights of 4 to 5 feet.I wasn't looking for a professional quality camera. Just a pocket sized one that could take good vacation pix and videos on the surface and underwater. The shots are decent. And the 12MP resolution gives me enough detail to crop and adjust as needed.Cropping may be needed since it is easy to get part of your finger in front of the lens due to its position in the upper corner. Once you learn how to hold the camera this isn't an issue. But you will probably take a few shots (or your friends will) that need finger surgery.Overall a good, rugged, general purpose camera.

I have \"no\" \"regrets\". It is definitely a step up. The LCD is \"brighter\" and the \"color logic\" is better than ever. It makes \"panoramas\" right in the camera, and does a pretty good job if you do what you're supposed to do as you \"pan\". No, not just a \"pretty good\" job, an \"excellent\" job.One of the new features of this model is something called \"Tap Control\". When I read the specs on that before I got the camera, I said, \"I Don't Need No Stinkin'\"Tap\" Control\"! Why would I want to \"hit\" my camera in order to make it do things? Boy, was I \"Wrong\". I love the \"Tap Control\". It's great. It's just that, a \"tap\". But, a \"definite\" tap. It doesn't just start changing settings for no reason, you have to \"tap\" it. The things that you used to have to \"toggle\" back and forth to access, you now just \"tap\" the camera sides or top or back. You know, the things you change on a regular basis like \"flash\" settings, \"macro\" settings, \"picture review\", all those can be controlled with \"taps\". If you don't want to \"tap\", you can turn that option off. However, I'll bet, once you start using \"tap control\" you will never go back to the \"toggle\". The \"tap\" is too easy, and too accurate. No more \"fumbling\" with the toggle. The overall feel of the Camera is just fine, and, as I'm sure you already know, it's \"bullet proof\". I have dropped my 770 on \"concrete\" from \"eye height\" and I had to \"hunt\" to find the \"micro scratch\" on it's corner.

I have taken it underwater, I teach swim lessons, and have had my camera in the water several times with no problems whatsoever, and all the kids think it's super cool. Definitely test your camera underwater before taking it out in the world, I'm sure that sometimes there are just errors in the production.I bought this camera after using a Nikon with an underwater housing for three years, but the underwater housing was so bulky it made my nice little Nikon a pain to carry, so I decided to upgrade. The biggest problem I had with my old Nikon point-and-shoot was getting the pictures to look the way I actually saw things, I had a lot of trouble with pictures that were too bright or too dark. I took my Olympus out on the first day and took picture after picture, playing with all of the different settings and functions and while I did have to find a good combination of settings, eventually, I got pictures back that looked exactly like what I was seeing with my own eyes.This is my first Olympus, but I am very impressed with the camera so far. The 3x zoom initially worried me, but the camera has plenty of zoom for what I've needed. One big difference I also noticed is that with my old camera, when I looked through the view finder or the screen, the image was further away than it actually was- like that passenger's side rear view mirror thing. But that doesn't happen with the Olympus, which is perhaps why the little zoom number isn't a problem. This is the first camera I've had with a re-chargeable battery, and the only thing that kind of surprised me was that the only way to charge the battery was while it was in the camera. I bought a package deal on Amazon with an extra battery, memory card, etc. so I was hoping that one battery could charge while I was using the other in the camera, but this is not so. I'll just have to be careful planning to have both batteries charged when I need to have them for big adventures.So overall, I'm really quite happy with this camera, I think it's fantastic and can't wait to travel again and take lots and lots of pictures.UPDATE- The following link is to some of the pictures I've taken with the Olympus Stylus Tough-8000.

I got the Sandisk 16GB Microsd Card and it works like a champ and kicks that maximum number of pictures into the thousands!We have used this camera now for two family outings and have found that the image stabilization works very well.  Low light performance is average, with the flash you get the usual \"over lit foreground, pitch black background\" effect, but that is just about standard in an all in one camera like this. You would really have to step up to a full DSLR Nikon or Canon to expect more.It is a bit heavier than you might expect, judging by its looks and dimensions.  However, the ability of this camera to really take abuse and keep working makes it well worth that extra heft. As advertised, it will indeed take pictures under water. Well, okay, so maybe it was just me sticking it under the water in the bathtub - but I was bound and determined to test that underwater claim out and it was pretty much the first thing I did after opening the box.The extra heft I mention has not put off my wife from the camera. She is a marathon/trail runner and takes it with her on her runs. No complaints so far.The one complaint I do have is that since the lense is in a slightly non-standard position (upper right hand corner) folks who use it will often put their finger in front of the lense. The usual user has gotten used to the lense being position more in the center of the body of the camera.Other than that, this camera has far more good to offer than bad and has so far proven to be the tough kid on the block when it comes to pocket cameras.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very tough, until it gets under water!", "Author": "Travelbug81 \"TB\"", "ReviewID": "R3P1CJKBDOILJT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm a Canon person, but I decided to stray from my successful formula and try this little Olympus.

It worked okay the first time I took it snorkeling, but the second time it began to act up.  Finally, it died and I found water in the battery/memory card compartment.  It ruined my trip and I immediately sent it into Olympus upon my return.  It came back all clean and seemed perfect...UNTIL I took it snorkeling again (on the next trip) and it immediately died.  In fact, I found water in both the battery and the usb compartments the second time.  I sent it back to Olympus and now it's supposed to be fixed, but I have yet to try it in the water.  I'm going to try it in the bathtub before I get on a plane again and I'm hoping it'll work this time.  Still, it's been a real roller coaster ride and I will never count on this camera to perform properly.  I was also VERY disappointed that Olympus failed to fix it properly.

The only problem I have seen that I really dislike in this area is that when you come out of the water and take pictures the lens tends to fog up most of the time and wiping it clean doesn't always solve that it just takes a little time.One downside to this camera is the Panaramic feature. It only allows 3 frames to be combined in the camera, to combine it in the computer is fine but I have seen cell phones that can take panaramics and combine more then 3.I haven't really put the crush, fall or freeze capabilities to the test yet and except for the latter don't plan to. During the winter I may add on to my review.I just want to make note. Don't expect this camera to take pictures like an SLR. It isn't cheap because of its resistance capabilities but it is still just a point and shoot camera.

I had read reviews saying the Canon had better image quality. I went to a local shop to hold them in my hand. the deciding factors were that A) I couldn't find an apreciable difference in quality taking a variety of shots inside and outside the store, B) The Olympus records sound, the Canon doesn't, and C) the Olympus has a lens cover, the Canon doesn't, and no matter how scratch proof they say it is I'm not taking a camera on a sand-filled Hawaiian vacation unless it can cvover the lens when int he pocket and laying around a towel.This camera was AWESOME in every situation. It outperformed every camera my relatives brought in every situation. It focuses quick, does fine in low light, and the iAuto feature is fantastic when you need something quick and aren't sure what settings to try. The shadow assist mode is SUPERB. The underwater shots are clear and while it has no capacity to add a red filter and therfore comes out tinted teal, it's a one click fix in Picasa to adjust 99% of them to darn near perfect. The camera performed great for panoramas, portraits, indoors, outdoors, low light, too much light, and underwater in sometimes murky conditionsI like the \"Fine\" Zoom which is kind of a semi-digital zoom without the typical crappiness of digital zoom. My only complaint is that it seems you have to turn fine zoom back on for most shooting modes every time you reboot the camera. This would be one of my two complaints and it's minor. I've had many cameras with scene featurs and I've never really used them always finding I got better pictures if I adjusted everytiong myself. In most cases with this camera, the Scene features do a really outstanding job, and the iAuto's abiity to pick the right scene and adjustment combos is really impressive.Battery life was great with both the original Olympus and a Maximal battery I got for $4 from Amazon. I did find the battery seemed to last longer when charged in a 3rd party charger than it did when charged in the camera off a USB cable. I'm not sure if this is user-error in the way I'm charging it or not.My only other complaint would be the choice to use XD and a MicroSDHC adapter rather than just using SDHC cards.

There are several items to note.  1) If you have large fingers or are wearing gloves, the buttons are pretty small so I found that I was hitting several buttons at the same time and the menus were popping up constantly - this was occuring while rafting & paragliding.  2)Once the lens got drops of water on it, these drops clearly showed in the picture and there were also instances of blurriness until the lens dried completely.With that said, I would recommend the purchase of the camera.  It takes really nice, high-quality pictures for a point & shoot camera.  It also provides lots of options for different types of shooting.

Over the three weeks of use this camera saw (ranging from backpacking trips to picnics) I took some really awesome shots.  However, in the end I just couldn't justify keeping it when it seemed to get all the basics wrong.  I am not a photography expert.  I don't know what aperture means and if you start talking about spot metering you're likely to lose my attention to something shiny.  Of course, those things are the reason that I purchased a point-and-shoot camera in the first place.  I read some of the early reviews (this camera premiered in April 09) and thought I had found a camera to fit my very active outdoor lifestyle.  A friend has the 790 SW and I really liked it, but it seems they made some mistakes when upgrading.When I first started taking pictures with it I thought maybe it was my own doing.  I, admittedly, don't know what I'm doing so I thought maybe I'd set some funky settings.  However, simply putting it on \"iAuto\" and focusing/shooting resulted in photos that only seemed good if the person(s) in them was standing completely still.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt though and tried it a few more times.  Unfortunately the result was consistent. I was throwing out 3/4s of the pictures I was taking.  Those numbers are unacceptable when some of the places you go take days of hiking to get to.  For an example of what I'm talking about please see the photo here.  I asked a friend to simply walk across the room while I took a picture with the Intelligent Auto feature on.  This is not a cool shot, AT ALL.  I repeated the process only using some of the scene settings (action specifically) and the result was a washed out noisy photo that I wouldn't think of posting.[...]I decided to give the camera two stars because it does do some things really well.  For instance, it survived a couple of drops, my chalky hands while rock climbing, and a river swim in the Smoky Mountains (with complete submersion).  However at the end of the day it's supposed to do those things AND take good pictures.  I have returned my camera to Amazon (awesome return policy) and will purchase another rugged style point-and-shoot soon.

For some reason, after using my camera to take photos and video in a swimming pool, the camera has become stuck on underwater mode whenever I try to use it for video -- and underwater video mode means no audio is recorded. I tried drying the camera, and washing and drying it again, but that didn't help. The manometer still seems to be working fine when the camera is in photo mode; when I submerge the camera it correctly enters underwater mode, and when I take it out of the water it returns to normal mode; just the video mode is stuck underwater for some reason.Another annoyance: there is no orientation sensor, so you have to rotate photos manually (and remember to do so before uploading them to your computer, if you want the exif orientation data to be correct.) No orientation sensor!?

The Audio portion of a Video recording is completely inaudible - reduced to a garbled and muffled set of barely recognizable sounds.  And, the Video itself consistently drops a frame every second or so when operating at the highest resolution even with the fastest SD cards.

For vacations & travelers, it means carrying around lots of extra equipment as Olympus chose to make everything proprietary.  For example, the standard USB cable that works with your other electronics will not work with Olympus, you need a separate cable for charging and for transferring pictures and video.  This rather defeats one of the primary benefits of USB.  Also they make you use microSD in a proprietary adapter, which raises the cost of memory about 3-4x over normal SD cards.The battery indicator is also misleading.  Even on a significantly full charge, if the temps are below 35 degrees, it will flash the low-battery warning incessantly and sometimes wont even charge the flash.  But it will last for hours of use after that.  Removing the battery, putting it into a warm pocket, and reinserting seems to address this problem.The flash and customization settings are perhaps the worst.  Many times when you want to change a setting on the camera (light, exposure length, etc.) , it will not permit and state \"this is not allowed with the current settings\".  So if you are in a room where you dont want to disturb other people (e.g. a performance), you cannot disable the flash under certain settings.The Tap help screen becomes really obnoxious after about an hour of use, as you have to wait for the message to clear before the display is usable.

I thought I had stumbled upon a truly rugged camera but it didn't last. I think the problem came from a drop it took from around 3 feet and that was enough to create a gap in the seal.

At first it wasn't as noticable, but as I took more pictures that spot gre and grew and became an utter nuisance.

After using it several times during those years, I enjoyed both the good and the bad.  It is light and nice on backpacking trips and has a good amount of megapixels.  The camera does however shoot VERY poorly in low light.  The camera has no idea how to manage these situations.  I still enjoyed this camera despite this fact on my adventures.  The reason I am giving this camera 1 star is its waterproofing.  I used the camera twice in water.  The first time was some fun photos in a swimming hole in New Hampshire.  I recently took the camera to snorkeling (the second time it was in water).  Everything was secure (battery/charger flaps) and I took preliminary shots in the shallows to make sure everything was functioning.  Once I got out 100 yards from shore in water that was 10 feet deep, the camera screen was black despite the blue light being on signifying the camera was on.  I quickly turned the camera off and returned to shore but the time I got there, the camera was finished.  There was water in the battery and charger area and the screen/entire camera was dead.  I feel like I wasted 300 (i bought it when it had just come out) on a camera that didn't deliver what it said it would.  I feel cheated.  I will never but olympus again especially since the olympus warrant doesn't cover water damage despite them claiming the camera is waterproof.

I have not used this camera fully nor as often as my previous Olympus Stylus SW1030 which I enjoyed immensely, but the Olympus Stylus Tough-8000 12 MP Digital's features are almost identical. This one has 12 MP in lieu of the 10MP of the previous model, and I think this new one is more rugged. Like my previous Stylus, it was easy to use however, this Olympus Stylus Tough-8000 12 mp has a card \"carrier\" where the card is located in the camera. The \"itty bitty\" card must first be removed from the carrier before inserting into the card reader to download pictures into the computer. I discovered, to my delight, that the card reader I own accepts this tiny one (in a slot on its side) as well as other sizes of camera picture cards.I like the compactness and ease of this little camera. My earlier point-and-shoot made it fun making splash photos in the pool - even without the u/w housing. At deeper depths, I used a camera housing (which I purchased at the same time with my earlier camera). Macro images always came out blurry for me, but it made pretty decent wide angle images- underwater pictures at depths beyond 30'. I hope my previous underwater camera housing (that I purchased with my SW1030) will equally accept this camera. Since the backside looks identical, I suspect it will. At the time of purchase (of my previous camera), at the photography shop, I was told I did not need to use an u/w housing at depths above 30' using the SW1030. In fact, that was true. I took many photos underwater at shallow depths but, in my own experience, I am now going to use the u/w housing to extend the life of the camera, no matter what the depth.The Olympus Stylus SW1030 was an easy-to-operate camera and I know this one will be too, however don't expect picture quality to be as high resolution as the underwater (film camera) Nikonos V or the more sophisticated digital underwater SLRs with u/w housing. My husband used it recently for topside photos and was pleased with the results. The photos were very clear!

It's still ticking.My wife and I are avid SCUBA divers and purchased an Ikelite underwater housing to take video and pictures on dive trips. I've had no problems other than fogging (keep the camera dry before hand, use desiccant packets and this isn't a problem) on our trips to Hawaii, the Bahamas and most recently the Great Barrier Reef.We purchased a second Oly Tough 8000 mostly because we love some of the features and we'll get more longevity out of our underwater housing.I bought both through amazon as well as additional batteries, charger and \"floaty wrist strap.\"Pro:Great to have at the lake with the floaty strap. Tuck it in a pocket, jump in the water and start snapping. I take it out on wakeboard passes and take closeups of others or pictures back towards the boat. Also good for tossing to someone in the water already (again, as long as it has the floaty attached).Really love the high speed shutter for action shots. Pictures aren't DSLR quality, but 3-4 pics per second and 10-15 total is pretty good. You can usually capture a good frame or two.Tap feature isn't bad in the snow, when you don't want to take your gloves offDrop it, smack it on a door frame in your pocket or sit on it... no worries.Con:The older camera, after about two years of abuse, has started to think batteries are dying/dead when switching back and forth between auto mode and any of the special settings. Not quite sure why but it doesn't seem to be the batteries as we'll use them in the newer camera and they're fine.Zoom. 3.6 just isn't that great for what I'm sometimes trying to do, but it's workable.The high-speed shutter takes smaller MP photos, usually less than one MP per picture or even just 300-500 Kb, but they're still not bad (read: not too grainy).I'd buy one again, but would look into the Sony's as they seem to have stepped up quite a bit in the waterproof/tough dept...Hope it helps.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "olympus stinks!", "Author": "annoyed photographer", "ReviewID": "R3J3QEA383933T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the Olympus Stylus Tough 8000 12 mp camera in Aug. of 2009.

This model was completely Sealed, did not and has not, noticed any problems, whatsoever, since early July 2009.TWO - I ordered the Olympus PT 045 Marine Polycarbonate case (not available anymore thru Amazon), at the same time. This Case IS A MUST GET ITEM for this camera, especially when Diving close to or beyond 1 ATM (33ft), and I cannot Say This More Clearly, it's a No-Brainer! My GF has Dived many times to 124 ft with this Olympus, and the Case is Completely Water-Proof.Whether, you are a Sports or Commercial Diver, you SHOULD have purchased this item already; it has completely prevented any Water or Shock problems!* EZ to operate, is Intuitive, with a rich Feature & Setting Controls, on-the-fly.* SHOCK-PROOF (6.6ft.) - Rugged metal body & shock-absorbing construction designed to withstand a 6.6-foot drop. Slipped out of her BC and dropped once on Pavement, with NO Damages!* WATER-PROOF (33ft.) - System of waterproof seals & gaskets keeps out water,  as deep as 33 feet (1atm) underwater. Extended to at least 150 ft with Case!* FREEZE-PROOF (14\u00b0F/-10\u00b0C) - winterized to perform at below-freezing temperatures. Not applicable to Hawaii!* CRUSH-PROOF (220lbf.) - a rugged body + reinforced LCD, withstands up to 220 pounds of pressure. Not planning on running my SUV over it, anytime soon, just so I can Whine later!* DUAL IMAGE STABILIZATION -  Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization compensates for camera shake to keep your shots steady while Digital Image Stabilization captures crisp, clear images. She just loves this feature!** Overall - Seems like every week passes that I get nothing but Kudo's and not just from my GF, but her girlfriends & Family as well. Everyone has been completely Impressed by this Olympus, and some have already purchased their own, in different colors, and including the TOUGH 6000 models, as well.Myself, I'm a Nikon Czar for many years, but I have to say that Olympus has produced a definite competitor model here, and has made Open-water Diving in Hawaii, a Great and rewarding experience, time after time. Again, I would Strongly Urge that anyone contemplating a Diving Trip, to purchase the Marine case, for so many good reasons.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "waterproof tough camera", "Author": "Mary E.

Night portraits are somewhat washed out, but I've always had this problem.  The included Beauty mode can even out those colors a little at the expense of resolution.My wife and I recently took the camera on our yearly snowshoeing trip, and there is no comparison the the photos taken previously.  The tap function was especially convenient, as it allowed me to adjust the Macro setting and show others our on-screen photos without taking off my gloves to get to the controls.  It's far slimmer than our previous camera and can be slipped into the pocket of a pair of jeans.I found the menus to be well laid-out and intuitive.  I would recommend playing with the tap mode at home to develop a little muscle memory.  It was the only thing about the camera that I thought had a learning curve.

This is my third Olympus Stylus Tough camera -- my first was an older model, and my second is at the bottom of the Connecticut River (darn!). I use it while kayaking, skiing and snorkeling. Some people have commented that this camera does not take the BEST quality photos, but they are missing the point. It takes very good photos where you'd never bring another camera. When I snorkle I dive down as far as I can manage -- 12, maybe 15 feet -- when I kayak the camera gets banged around, and when I ski I don't worry about the camera. When I get home, I can adjust the picture quality on my computer if needed. I have tons of wonderful photos I'd otherwise miss out on.On a recent trip to the Caribbean I had the camera in the water every day. At night I'd rinse off the salt as per Oly's instructions. The last day the camera died -- when I opened the battery compartment there was a bit of seawater inside. The memory card was fine, though. When I got home I sent the camera, still under warranty, to Olympus. 2 days later, UPS delivered a brand new camera from Olympus -- no questions, no argument. Every now and then a defective product gets past quality control, so it's nice to know Olympus completely stands behind their product.I am very happy with this camera and would recommend it without hesitation.

I've had it for 2 years and have used it in pools and the ocean.I did have a moisture leak at the beach during the middle of vacation. I think it was caused by sand that prevented the seals from sealing. I found water inside the battery compartment AND inside the data port area. The camera continued to take photos, but the video screen blacked out, so I couldn't tell if it was working or not.I used a tip from a friend to fix it. Besides the obvious drying off the components gingerly, I bought a couple of pounds of uncooked rice and a big tupperware-type container. I opened the camera doors and put it in the rice and sealed it all up. In theory, the rice sucks the moisture out. I had been told to give it 3 days, but I only waited 1 day to test -- and it worked good as new afterward. I took more care to remove all of the little bits of sand from the seals and use the camera in the ocean 2 more days without any problems.The weakest aspect of this camera is the video recording. The videos come out a bit dark, grainy and jumpy, and the audio is terrible. But considering everything else this camera does so well, I can't take off any stars for that.I bought the black camera, but after 2 years of rugged use, the black decal has completely disappeared.

That camera was a tank as I treated it very rough and it keeped on trucking, had 7.1 mega pix. and took amazing underwater photos. A friend had the second gen. 1030sw and the only real inprovement was the 10.1 mega pix. and some minor changes. When this 3rd gen. Tough-8000 came out I had the chance to check it out at best buy but didn't want to pay there high price so I purchased it through amazon. Here are some major improvements that are worth getting this bulldozer.Pros:1. Was a big pet peeve of mine when I viewed photos on the 770sw LSD and all the display info would cover up most of the photo for like 3 seconds till it fully displayed the photo. On the 8000 that is not a problem anymore as all you do is hit the display button as you view a photo and there are now 4 different info displays to view a photo, my favorite being no info and just the plain photo.2.Glare from the sun while I took underwater photos was a big problem with the 770 and 90% of the time I could not view what I was taking a picture of and just guess shooting. I don't know what they did but now I can see the LCD under water as if I was on land, big plus...3. Tap control is a new and fun feature that makes this camera that much user friendly. Really like how you tap it anywhere on the right side to view photos and left to go back, I have tapped it pretty fast and it keeps up.4. Size does matter and they made the 8000 a little bit bigger than the other models as it feels more comfortable.Cons:Only real con I have is when I pick one of the 19 scenes it offers and want to use digital or fine zoom I have to go into the menu and set it, once I turn the camera off or go to the play menu to view my photo I have to repeat this process all over again.

We also wanted a tough camera because, well, we have a toddler.  This camera by far exceeded my expectations for a hand held.  You can adjust the ISO, white balance, and even do pixel mapping...granted it doesn't give as much user manipulation as the SLR but it's more than I expected.It has 19 automatic settings ie: Portrait, landscape, sport etc. (including 4 underwater settings), it has a better than average close up (even good with documentation photos), it allows you to set the depth (underwater) at which you are taking photos, it has a shadow reducer, image stabilizer, and even a beautifying option that softens the portrait after you take it.  I've taken many pictures in the pool and they are very good (better than disposable underwater cameras) but have yet to try it out in natural water (it's also ok to use in sea water).The down points in my opinion...  It has a tap function (where you can tap parts of the camera to take photos/manipulate the camera).  It is very difficult to learn and doesn't work all that well in my experience.  The problem is, it turns itself on very easily and you have to go to the menu to turn it off.  The dial that moves the settings from automatic, to video camera, to playback, etc moves very easily and can be moved accidently.  This happened to me quite a few times.  The camera is bump proof but definitely not scratch proof.  My toddler has dropped and tossed it a couple of times and it's survived wonderfully...but it's scratched like crazy.  The zoom isn't great...but to be able to survive the water it has to be encased...the camera is a 12 mp so it's not that big of a deal...just mentioning it.  Also the video camera just isn't all that great.  It doesn't allow you to zoom at all, it's a bit grainy in low light, and you only have the choice to set it as underwater or dry.In my opinion these aren't deal breakers...just annoyances.  If you are looking for a great point and shoot, that can survive bumps and bruises and also works underwater (up to 33 ft) I definitely recommend this one.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a guy like me", "Author": "Justin Clift", "ReviewID": "R2J57QA3TJQ8E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is me-proof, I have go through 4 digital camera before I realized it was time to fork over the extra cash to get one that is destruction-proof.

I knew I was going to be doing a great deal of water activities and wanted to make sure I could capture all the fun and memories.The camera itself took quite nice photos, until it died after getting wet once.  I took the camera snorkeling at Molokini crater in Maui.  Since I was snorkeling the camera was only a few feet underwater, nowhere close to the 10m (33f) depth the camera is supposed to be able to be waterproof too.After one use, the camera lens got drops of water \"trapped\" behind it.  Which could clearly be seen in both the LCD and photos taken.  The back LCD also appears to have allowed water to seep in and to add final insult to injury, the unit stopped powering on shortly afterwards.I made sure to follow all instructions.  I even brought them with me on holiday, to ensure proper use of the camera.  Since this was a once in a lifetime vacation for me, I wanted to guarantee I'd have wonderful photos for years to come.Instead I had a $400 paperweight.  What's most upsetting are all the lost photos (memories).  I was unable to get photos of my kayaking, waterfall and snuba adventures (to name a few) later in the trip.  I am not sure if the unit I had was just defective or if their is a larger problem with these cameras in general.But really when it comes to your vacation or other special event do you really want to chance having a defective camera?  Please I urge you do not trust your treasured moments and photos to this camera, or Olympus.This camera was bought for the sole purpose of capturing all the fun memories of my holiday.  Instead it's now a constant reminder of all the lost photos (memories).I returned the camera to Olympus to be repaired (at a cost of $20).  I was sent an email shortly after sending the unit in for repair.  With an \"offer\" to swap the defective unit for a new (or refurb) model for an additional cost!?!  The unit died the first time it was used, and they want me to pay for another one?The camera was returned back to me, no paperwork was provided as to what caused the problem, and what (if anything) was done to fix the unit.

By the end of the vacation the camera had been dropped on cement or dirt at least 4-5 times and it works great.We also tested this camera in the St. Lawerence River. We were very sceptical since well it is not in our nature to put electronics in the water. We made sure to read the manual which we forgot to bring and downloaded one online instead. After we made sure the ports for the camera cord, battery compartment/memory card were definately closed into the river it went. We took many underwater pictures. The camera went down to about 5-8 feet and was just fine. Photos came out great and we couldn't be happier. We did not test the temperature aspect of this camera but did use the \"tap\" feature (by mistake). I will take this sking with me this winter and see how it fares.One tip I have is that if you are planning to take this underwater, get a flotation device.
