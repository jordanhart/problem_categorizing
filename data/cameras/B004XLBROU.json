I did not use the full functionality of this remote starter. Used only the remote start part and not the lock/unlock features. 2 way communication is working well. Having two remotes helps. 2 way remote has good range. I park my car atleast 250 feet away from the office building and able to start the car without getting out my chair.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.99", "Features": "2 Car Operation With 1-Way Remotes\nPlug-In User Programmable Coded Override Switch & Led On Antenna\nBuilt-In Programmable Parking Light Relay (\u00b1)\nTrue Rpm Sensing For Real Time Cranking\nRemote Start Tachless Mode Using Adaptive Digital Processing", "Name": "Remote Start With Keyless Entry ASTRA 1000RS-2W-1-DBP", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Bwjv1QvCL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004XLBROU"}}
