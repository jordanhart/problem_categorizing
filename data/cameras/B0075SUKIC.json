{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Consider this waterproof camera first", "Author": "Micah Wakabayashi", "ReviewID": "R3KSKF6J0C83LK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I preordered this camera when it was first announced. I was a little disappointed when Amazon dropped the price before it even reached my house. I anticipated this camera not only for the waterproof capabilities, but also because it is shock proof...and probably because it was a Canon. I live in Hawaii and intend to take this to the beach to take photos and videos in and out of the water. I'm a special education teacher and wanted to have my students to create their own learning stories with photos that they took themselves. I am very reluctant to have them use a DSLR or even a regular point & shoot camera with the fear of them dropping $1000+ worth of equipment.When I got the camera, I quickly looked over the manual for any waterproof information that I might need to know. Everything was straight-forward with no hard-to-find switches to lock any waterproof seals. In other words, feel free to take this out of the box, put in the card and battery, and take underwater photos. I didn't even charge the battery and was able to take about 100 photos and 15 minutes of video right out of the box. I used this opportunity and the next 2 days to extensively test my camera in order to create this review.DESIGN: 6/10It's feels very sturdy like it should. The blue metal panel on the front is very nice to look at. Unfortunately, I think the shape is a little too \"showy\". If you want to show off the fact that you have a waterproof camera then this is the one for you. (I sort of liken it to a Prius, which everyone knows is a hybrid. At first glance, many people will know there is something special about this camera.) I'm a little confused about the left-hand side of the camera which is a little curved. You can put a strap there, but I don't really see the functionality of it being that shape.My biggest gripe is that the included handstrap can be \"twisted\" on and clicks into a metal plug. It can be EASILY removed with a very light press on the button and twisting it off. It gives me the fear that it could be accidentally bumped and twisted and the camera will detach from your wrist (though you'd probably have to be mighty clumsy to do so). I would have wished that the strap attached directly to the camera instead of this metal knob. The strap clip also protrudes diagonally out of the bottom corner and you need to remove this if you want to lay in on a flat surface to take photos or video.IMAGE QUALITY: 9/10I am a camera enthusiast and mainly use Canon DSLRs (5D, 7D, 1D series, etc...) with L lenses. I also have an Olympus micro 4/3s camera and even have a Nikon D2x, so I'd like to think I know my stuff. Prior to this point & shoot, I used a Canon SD1100 before it got stolen. With this SD1100, I took over 10,000 photos and took hundreds of hours of video (which I made into DVDs to view on TV, or straight from iTunes to a TV...it's only 480p) edited with iMovie. I've always gotten compliments on the video quality of this older model P&S;, and was quite impressed with it myself.As far as photo quality of this camera, I've got to say that it's good, but nothing more than what you'd expect from a P&S; camera from 2012. Color is nice and even zoomed in at 100%, the image quality is as great as one might expect. As with any camera, keeping the ISO as low as possible will keep any noise or grain to a minimum. Remember, you're paying a premium because this camera can go underwater or in the snow. It would be unfair to expect DSLR quality from this camera because that's not what it's meant for.The same goes for video quality: the reason you bought this camera and paid more for it than another P&S; is because it is waterproof. If you want that IMAX look, you've got to spend thousands of dollars. If you can't afford that, this is the next best thing. The quality of the out-of-water and underwater videos was superb. I took it to our pool and took videos of various colorful toys underwater. It was a sunny day and the quality was great, vibrant, and clear. I wasn't able to test it in low light situations. I also have a Panasonic TS-10 (underwater camera from 2010) and the Canon D20's video and image quality is surprisingly better.For on-land videos, the microphone is not as good as normal P&Ss.; I'm assuming that it has another waterproof protective layer over it. I don't think this should be surprising to anyone.One last note on video. This camera has a 5x zoom. When shooting video, it can optically zoom in and out. It will also focus all the way from macro to infinity while still recording, which is different from other cameras that I used in the past, where if you started your video, it couldn't refocus or optically zoom. It even adjusts exposure, meaning that if you're recording in a bright area and come into a dim area, it will adjust automatically while still recording video. Thank you Canon!ERGONOMICS: 8/10Buttons are nicely spaced. There is a large thumb rest button that I just can't figure out why it's there except for cosmetic purposes. I thought the playback button on the top was a little strange, but the shutter button is much larger and protrudes so you shouldn't get them confused. It's somewhat on the larger side for a point and shoot, but it probably has something to do with the waterproofing, shockproofing, and freezproofing. It can still fit in pants pockets. I thought the black parts of the camera would have a little more grip, but they are plastic and not rubber. I have no complaints about the design or shape and it felt comfortable to hold. I was able to press buttons underwater very easily.The screen is very bright at the default middle setting. It is bright enough that it was not necessary to brighten it while underwater. It is very clear and easy to look at. I hope sand or other earth elements don't scratch the screen since I don't know if I'll be able to apply one of those protective sheets over the LCD as it might fall off while underwater.Snowboarders or divers with gloves might have different experiences than a casual user like myself as far as the button spacing is concerned.The lens doesn't have a cover. It is in the upper corner, similar to other waterproof cameras. Not much out of the ordinary to comment on this. I got some sunscreen on it and wiped it off harshly with a t-shirt. No scratches at all. I'm hoping it's made of durable glass like other waterproof cameras.The flash is moved to the middle. I find this makes it easier to avoid covering it with my fingers as I do with other cameras where the flash is in the upper corner. Definitely a plus.BATTERY LIFE: 9/10With a full charge I took 150 photos and about 30 mins of videos and still had 1 of 3 power bars leftover (approximately 33%? remaining life). If this is a vacation camera, it should easily be able to last a full day before you need to charge it at the hotel. If you're taking this camping or somewhere with no power, practice using it to gauge how long it will last. When the battery starts flashing, you still have about 10 minutes of video left before it completely dies.In comparison, the Panasonic TS10 seems to die out before taking even 200 shots with no video. I am not pleased at all with the Panasonic's battery life.WATERPROOFING: 10/10I've used this only a few times so far (though intentionally submerged it in water overnight for this review) and have experienced no leaks. I have never experienced leaks with my Panasonic waterproof camera either. If it did leak it would get a zero, but for now, I can't say. It seems to be waterproof. I was a little skeptical about the latches on this camera and felt that there might be a chance that they could get accidentally opened since they only require one flip rather than use a 2-step safety switch, but I tried rubbing it and dragging it over areas that could possibly open the battery and input/output latches but they seem to stay closed as expected.As with other waterproof cameras, be careful when taking this out on a boat or to the dock where you aren't in the water yourself. In my pool it took only 4 seconds for it to fall 8 feet. They don't float! Imagine if you're over the edge of a pier in 30 feet of murky dark water. It will hit the bottom before you can take your sunglasses off. The detachable strap (as mentioned above) is so easy to intentionally remove that I feel that it could also be easily removed accidentally. I am highly considering a floating strap.SHOCKPROOFING: ?/10Uh, I'll trust Canon and not attempt to drop this camera just for the sake of this review. The box says it can withstand a 5 foot drop and I'll take their word for it.BELLS AND WHISTLES: 7/10GPS: Works I guess. It has a little trouble getting a signal inside, and this is my first camera with GPS, so I'm not sure how accurate it should be. But it was able to record the coordinates of my outdoor shots (though not all of my indoor shots).Camera features: It has SMILE DETECTION that seems to wait for the whites of the subject's teeth to snap the photo (a big grin doesn't seem to work). This will work great with my special needs students, who can just hold the camera and ask for the subject to smile. SUPER SLOW MOTION is pretty cool. It needs a lot of light and can only take it at low resolution. It also includes other more commonly included effects such as FISHEYE and MINIATURE. I don't think I'll find myself using these effects quite often. You can go to Canon's website or other review sites to find out more.Playback features: Includes commonly found features such as slideshow functions and a photobook set-up. What confused me was the ACTIVE DISPLAY which lets you scroll through photos by tapping the corners of the camera with your index fingers during playback. A cool gimmick perhaps meant for snowboarders with thick gloves. I found it easier to scroll with my thumb on the directional keys.Macro: (added this part in later) Forgot to mention the macro capabilities of this camera. It is unbelievably versatile. It can clearly and easily focus on items even 1cm away from the camera. And it's smart so you don't have to change settings from normal to macro modes (although it does have that capability if it can't detect it automatically). I haven't used any of Canon's newest P&S;'s, so don't know if this is normal to be this good. Feel free to take macro pictures of bugs, wet plants, or rocks, without worrying about the camera getting wet, dirty, or knocked around.OVERALL IMPRESSIONSThis is a very solidly built camera that is very eye catching. Image quality is EXCELLENT for a point and shoot camera. After using a waterproof Olympus, as well as a Panasonic one, I would definitely recommend this Canon D20 for the superior image quality. I was originally going to give this a 4-star rating, but that would mainly be because I thought the strap placement and it's funky non-rectangular design were huge issues. However, after reviewing my photos and videos, this is definitely the waterproof camera to buy! The image quality is very exceptional for a point & shoot. If you're trying to capture those underwater photos during a trip-of-a-lifetime, spend a little more and get this camera.Update: 5/31/2012I'd like to add just a few more things since using this camera for about a month now.Image Quality: No RAW. There are a number of mid to high-range P&S;'s with RAW. This does not have RAW. I don't want to get into a debate about the necessities of RAW on a P&S.; This is what you get with this camera.I took this to the beach and had it around my wrist for about 3 hours in salt water. The water was shallow, but I did not feel like I might accidentally undo the strap like I had originally thought. I also took it into the pool as well as in a jacuzzi (for about 30 minutes). No leaks, no indications of leaks, no water issues. I've had smaller P&S; cameras before, and when looking at the size of this thing, it's quite large for 2012. However, I had it in my pants pocket and swim trunk pocket, and I didn't notice or mind the weight. I was able to take a number of low-light video...of course there's noise, but it was very acceptable and looks great in HD. Over 3 days I took about 12GBs of videos and photos. As I had guessed earlier, the battery should last the whole day until you're able to charge it overnight. I feel that the GPS sucks a lot of battery power, as I did get the flashing red battery towards the end of each day. And I couldn't get any videos of fish. They kept swimming away from me and I didn't have a snorkel. I will try to go to Hanauma Bay one day with this camera.Students in my class have been able to use it, and it just feels so much less stressful letting them use a shockproof camera versus even a $90 regular P&S.; It really allows them to experiment in their own way without restrictions or having an adult pay more attention to the camera than anything else. It's a pricey investment for children (so don't get one just because you'd like your 3 year old to become a photographer), but we used our other P&S; for 3 years+ very diligently (until it got stolen) and know that we will use this one just as much as the other one.Update: 4/30/2014Discovered this a long time ago. The GPS uses a LOT of battery power. Personally I'm not at the point where I need to know the exact coordinates of my shots, so I leave it off. If you're going hiking or traveling, you might want to keep it on just for that novelty. Just be sure to bring your charger with you.The camera is still great. Although it doesn't go into the water on a regular basis, during the occasional dips into water, I feel confident that the seals will hold up (which they have up until now with absolutely no signs of breaking...knock on wood). The LCD screen has minor light scratches on it.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be Sure To Understand The Trade-Offs", "Author": "Thomas Regner", "ReviewID": "RYH31J5Z16CB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's easy to be mislead by the marketing hype and glowing reviews, as I was, that this is a high-end general purpose pocket-sized 12 megapixel camera that takes stunning photographs and just happens to also be waterproof. But after evaluating the camera - and very nearly returning it in disappointment - I just want to caution others that this isn't the case.This is a specialty camera for taking passable snapshots underwater and under inclement conditions. Significant concessions in image quality were made to \"ruggedize\" the camera, and these are apparent even under ideal conditions. This is true of all cameras of this type to date, and this camera is no exception. Shadow and background areas are suffused with noise pixels. Focus is soft, especially in low light. Chromatic aberration (colored fringes) is/are easily visible in areas of high contrast, even when images are reduced in size. Unless your standards are fairly low, I doubt you can get prints larger than 8x10 from the images the camera takes, under ideal outdoor daylight conditions. For pictures taken indoors, there's so much noise, even using the flash, that 5x7 is probably the limit.If you're content to use the camera for what it's made for, it's a lot of fun. It works in the rain. It works under the lawn sprinkler. It works in the pool. It works at the beach. You can prop it up or set it down on wet or snowy or muddy surfaces to stabilize a shot, and just rinse it off later. It can sit in the puddle at the bottom of your kayak between shots. It's certainly adequate for uploading proof of your adventurous nature to Facebook. It has a very nice feature set, although it can be hard to figure out what some things are for, and hard to remember where some settings are located. It takes surprisingly nice video for a pocket-size camera, with zoom available while recording (the sound is mono though.) I actually like that the camera is fairly large - pants pocket size, not shirt pocket size - well suited to large hands, or gloves. It feels very solid. (The strange grip on the left is weird though. I couldn't possibly hold the camera the way the manual shows, but I make do.)If you also want to take tack-sharp pictures, especially indoors, or make big enlargements, or be able to crop the pictures down a lot later, you're going to need a second camera for that. If you don't want two cameras, you need to decide what you want more, and how often you'll benefit from a waterproof camera. If rainproof is all you really need, you might be better off making strategic use of a ziplock bag. (Cut a hole in one side for your hands, and point the camera toward the zipper opening, like a poncho.)If you truly need a rugged waterproof camera, this is a very nice option. If waterproof is just a \"sounds-nice-to-have\" for you, the image quality may be a big disappointment.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it for what it is. Don't judge it for what it ain't.", "Author": "LuckiestGirlEvr", "ReviewID": "R1UBKXQC16LMGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're anything like me, you've read all the reviews on all the waterproof cameras available today, you've combed over comparisons by the pros, and you've narrowed it down to this, the Olympus Tough, and the Panasonic Lumix.At this point you need to know if the D20 is worth the money, and if you need an extremely durable waterproof camera that takes great photos, I am here to tell you that it absolutely is.I took it on a cruise with two other couples who had a Panasonic (new, but not waterproof), the Fujifilm Finepix (an older version) and an Olympus Tough (brand spankin' new). My photos were the best of the groups, hands down. In fact, amongst a group where we took the same photo with everyone's camera so each couple had that awesome group shot, everyone ended up preferring my version.The awesome parts:- The D20 has the absolute *best* color saturation of any of the camera's we had on our trip. No other camera even held a candle to it. My photos were SO vibrant. Indoor, especially outdoor, sunset's, sunrise, all of them awesome.- It has the best 'features' or 'scenes.' The 'miniature building' one was used frequently, and the 'underwater' scene was absolutely amazing.- Again, color balance of our underwater photos was insanely awesome. Even in shallow water where lots of sand was kicked up (Stingray Sandbar in Grand Cayman).- Video kicked ass. Zooming in and out whilst filming was invaluable, and the quality of video is insanely good. I read lots of complaints about the sound quality but I filmed a friend singing Karaoke with a live band and it sounds crisp, clear, and perfect. I just don't get the sound complaints.- Battery life was super long. I even had the GPS on most of the time and it wasn't anything I couldn't handle by charging it up every other night. And I took somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 photos and 10 videos on that trip.- The menus make sense and are quick. Sure it takes a good 'playing around' session to get used to them, but I was flipping scenes faster than anyone else taking photos on other cameras.- It's DURABLE. I came out of a slide in Montego Bay at Margaritaville going probably 20mph and I SLAMMED into the water. The D20 was looped around my bikini top's strap, and it hit the water so hard the first thing I did when I came up was grab it to make sure it was okay. Totally. flippin'. fine. It took that slam like a champ.The not so awesome parts:- The photos are noisy in low-light settings, and when you zoom in super close. I think the only waterproof camera with less noise in the photos is the Panasonic Lumix. I wanted to get the Lumix but it had a smaller screen, isn't nearly as rugged, and has a LOT of reviews claiming leakage. I couldn't risk that on this trip.- The stupid wrist strap... for the love of all that is holy, why in Gods name did they put the wrist strap in the corner like that? It's ridiculous and begs for the camera to get scratches because I'm constantly laying it on it's face or back.- It's big. I couldn't find a case for it off the shelf. I ended up squeezing it into a Built neoprene case from Target, but our first cruise-stop was Key West and low and behold, the D20 fits PERFECTLY into a Coach wristlet. (For those of you who needed an excuse to hit the Coach outlet,... I'm just sayin'.)- There's no 'trash' button on the screen. This is super weird because almost every other camera let's you delete a photo with one button and a confirmation (even my other Canon), but not so with the D20. I found that annoying.So at the end of the day, I say you should LOVE this camera for what it is: Extremely durable, waterproof, all-purpose camera that takes great photos full of vibrant color. And don't attempt to judge it for what it ain't: A DSLR or professional-level camera that gets photos you can print to the size of your wall.Am I happy I got it? Totally.Am I okay with having spent $280 on it? I was iffy at first, but after our vacation there are no doubts. In fact, my friends who didn't want to spend the money on it ended up using and loving it so much while we were on the trip that they're planning on getting it now. It's just all-around awesome.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great performance underwater with this camera!", "Author": "Consumer", "ReviewID": "R1XGA3A2Q0UQ92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for a trip to Hawaii for taking pictures while snorkeling. We were a little concerned because we had purchased a Kodak waterproof camera last fall when we last went to Hawaii that flooded after the first time using it in the water. We didn't know if it was because the Kodak camera was cheap/poorly made or if waterproof cameras always ended up leaking, as all the waterproof cameras seems to have a bunch of \"it leaked\" reviews. We had read good reviews about this camera's previous version, the D10, so we decided to take the gamble with this one.This camera worked great, no leaks at all. We used it in the water almost everyday of our 10 day trip, for hours at a time. We got some really great shots, including out of the water. It also has an underwater macro that we think works really well. Taking pictures underwater takes some practice to get good looking shots, but we got some really great close ups of turtles, fish and eels. We also like the wrist strap attachement on the camera, which some people have complained about. We like it because you can remove the wrist strap from the camera fairly easily when putting it in a case, which was convenient for us, because we use a floating wrist strap that is kind of bulky.The one thing I would stress is to make sure you rinse off the camera after each use in the ocean. We would just fill a ziplock bag with fresh water, drop the camera in for a couple of minutes (make sure to press the buttons too when they are submerged in the water) and then dry it off completely. We have read that this is the key to keeping the waterproof gaskets on the camera from getting salt and sand build up that can cause leaks (says this in the manual too, but not sure how many people actually read the manual).We couldn't recommend this camera more, we know it is not the cheapest, but it works great.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Images -- Sound Quality/Waterpoofing Issue", "Author": "Lucas Smith", "ReviewID": "R3D3H57T97DAIF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "***Updated - I am on my second amazon return.  The second camera had much better sound quality until i took it in the water.  Now i am having the exact same issue where the sound is almost non-existant on all videos.  I really wanted to like this camera as the images and features were really cool.  Not sure if i just got unlucky or what, but if you get this make sure to test yours out!!!!***I am currently returning my camera for replacement by Amazon, so i will update this if the new unit fixes my issues.Deal Breaker - Sound quality, in particular volume is absolutly terrible.  I have to yell into it for it to pick up anything, and it can't consistantly pick up my kids talking even from a couple feet away.  Sometimes it works though, which is really frustrating.  It could be just a defective unit so If a new one fixes my issues I will update this.Pros:- Image quality is very good- Low light performance, even under water is very good (not quite as good as the non rugged point and shoots, but still very good)- I have tested it down to ~20ft underwater and it held tight.  Got some great fish pictures!- Video options are good.  I like the 120fps mode in particular - got some unique cool shots.- Lens (wide angle to zoom) is pretty nice.Cons:- A little bulky- Strap attachement is in a bad spot.  You have to remove the strap to be able to set the camera flat on a table, and a little werid while holding- Flash seems a little underpowered, but not too much of an issue yet.- Battery life isn't great, especially while using GPS- ** Sound issues on video recording.

Of course they lowered the price $20 two days later, but it is still a very good value for what you get. This camera is replacing a Sony Cybershot that also was a 12MB camera. The reason we decided to go with this camera is because we found that having a good camera and a separate camcorder was becoming cumbersome. This camera gives you an all-in-one advantage as it is a good quality point and shoot camera as well as an HD video camera and it is rugged and waterproof. I also recommend getting a Sandisk Extreme Card for this camera because those cards have the speed to handle Full HD video. We went with the 32GB version just to make sure we had plenty of space. Also buy extra batteries!! You can also find an inexpensive (under $4) HDMI Mini to HDMI cable to hook this camera up directly to your TV to showcase your HD footage.If you are looking for a very high quality camera, you will never get that in a point and shoot which this is. If you are looking for good quality pictures, this camera will meet those needs. If you are looking to shoot an academy award winning movie, once again this is not the right choice for you. This camera is for the everyday user that wants to have good pictures and HD video in one place. This is perfect for families and it can go in the pool, to the beach, and can still be handled by a toddler as it can handle some abuse. You can get a much better camera (with 20x+ optical zoom versus 5x) for the same price without the waterproof feature so make sure that is what you are looking for. Being able to take it anywhere was our number one feature.Features we loved:--Waterproof and Rugged--Full HD Video (also allows you to zoom while recording which most cameras do not allow)--Has a good look to it (some of the competitors have a very boxy look)Features that could have been done better (why it is 4 stars instead of 5):--The camera has a place for the strap on the left side. They intended that to be for the shoulder strap, but the screw in handle strap attachment made for the lower right side is very awkward. In other words, I have always had my camera strapped to my right hand and now I need to get used to strapping it to my left hand. They should have had a built it strap loop on each side.--They put the on/off button, picture taking button, and playback button lined up all on the top side of the camera. Be prepared to line up that perfect shot, but miss it because you hit the playback button instead of the picture taking button. The playback button should have been on the back side of the camera.--The camera is quite big for a point and shoot.

However last year when I was stuck between the Canon D10 or Panasonic Lumix, I chose the Lumix based on it's superior specs at the time. The image quality was overly sharp, and the colors were dull. It definitely did not hold up to my expectations. When the weather was warm it would frequently fog the lens and LCD, leaving me unable to take clear photos. I took very good care of it, yet it still glitched a few times and shut itself off after being in a pool for 15-20 minutes.Anyway, the camera was stolen from me last fall and I was elated to see Canon was finally upgrading their underwater camera. I pre-ordered it, and had my first chance to use it two weeks ago for a rafting trip. The pictures came out crisp, sharp (but not too much so), vibrant - everything I love about my other powershots, rebels and 5Ds! This is the greatest picture quality I have seen in a camera that does not have a retractable lens. In fact, my friend loved the photos from the trip so much that he is planning on upgrading his underwater-case (another fog-loving solution) for this model as well!I can't speak much for it's durability as it's only made two underwater trips so far - but those have been great!

However, I've played around with it enough to provide some helpful impressions.LIKES* Overall image quality is good.  Considering the conditions in which you can shoot with this (wet, cold, hot, dusty, etc.), I'd rate image quality as very good.* Low-light performance.  Most of the underwater pictures I've shot were in the pool in the evening with no direct sunlight.  Given the lighting conditions, the images far exceed a typical point-and-shoot.  Considering they were shot underwater (taking away quite a bit more light), the increased challenges of automatic focusing, etc. and I'd rate the image quality fantastic.* Form factor.  A little awkward, but fun and easy to hold & use once you get the hang of it.  The included strap is well done, rugged, and can easily cinch tight on your wrist for times when you are in the water or in other settings that might make keeping hold of it a challenge.* Video quality.  Excellent!  I've been shooting videos in full HD and watching them on my 42\" HDTV.  The quality far exceeds what I expected.* LCD.  It is 3\", bright, and easy to use underwater.* Battery life.  Very good considering it has no optical viewfinder, meaning the LCD is constantly on.* Zoom.  Haven't played with this too much, but the wide range on this camera makes this quite versatile.* Exposure.  One pleasant surprise is how quickly and how well the exposure adjusts to/from underwater and out of the water lighting.  It does have a dedicated underwater setting, which might further improve my underwater shots, but Auto works great if you are moving back & forth often.DISLIKES* Very limited manual controls.  On the plus side, the Auto mode works well, and how much do you really want to fumble with manual settings while underwater or in other challenging settings?* Price.  Yes, it is a bit too expensive for everyone to grab one.  But $ for $, this is a fantastic bargain for a high-quality rugged, waterproof camera.* Limited flash control.  Most point-and-shoots nowadays allow you to force the flash to fire, which can be really helpful at eliminating shadows, among other things.  In Auto mode, you can't do this (though it might be possible when you use other modes).  On the plus side, it does so well in low light that this is less of an issue.* It is not the best all-around point-and-shoot camera.  If I were to have just 1 camera in this price range, it would be the Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) or something similar.  My S95 produces FAR superior images and offers full manual control.  BUT... what you are paying for with the D20 is something that you can knock around, drop, take in the water, use in the rain or snow, etc. and not worry about.If you are an outdoor enthusiast and find yourself missing a lot of shooting opportunities because the conditions aren't safe for a regular point-and-shoot, I don't think you can much better than this.  I thought of just using my S95 and getting an underwater housing for it, but those are costly.  The D20 is capable of great shots, especially in tough conditions (see some of my samples from time in a pool), and is easy to grab at a moment's notice.  And that fact that it is rugged makes me a lot more willing to allow my kids to shoot with it.

My mother who is in town visiting has the Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 and I decided to do a side by side comparison. I will upload some comparison shots, but the bottom line is that they perform nearly exactly the same in every way. Video quality, image quality, macro performance, resolution, zoom range, all close enough to make it impossible to tell if a picture was taken with one or the other when viewing them on the computer later.I now think of this camera is as an ELPH 300 with a rugged case. The internalized zoom mechanism may cause some slight image quality degradation, but I could not tell from my side by side testing.If you want a super small point and shoot, get the ELPH 300, if you want a slightly larger point and shoot that can handle a few knocks and is waterproof, get the D20.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for a rugged camera", "Author": "S.

However, it is sturdy and well built and feels like it could take some knocks (obviously since it's a rugged camera).The camera works just any other of Canon's point and shoots. Perhaps one let down the feature set is relatively basic. You don't get a lot of shooting options with the camera or manual control. But otherwise it's very simple to navigate through the settings and find what you need. The LCD is fairly bright on back and the battery life is pretty good.The zoom buttons work fine on the camera. The lens zooms in and out relatively fast. In fact, this camera surprised me with its performance. I had lowered expectations regarding its autofocus speed and shot to shot times, but they almost match my Canon Powershot S100 in that regard. Which isn't to say that it's a really fast camera but most people will find it reasonably fast in most lighting conditions.Image quality is pretty good. And not just for a rugged camera. The lens is sharp and detail capture is decent for a point and shoot. In bright light, the results are very decent. Low-light pictures are not as great, but still okay. But this is pretty normal for this class of camera. Still, if you're mostly uploading to the web or Facebook, you should be pretty happy with the results.I dunked the camera in a stream while hiking for an underwater shot and I had no issues whatsoever afterwards. The camera has a special \"underwater mode\" you can use to maximize image quality for underwater shots.A great rugged camera, all-in-all.

I had two issues with it though, the body was too fat and the video was only 640 x 480. When the new Canon D20 came out  it looked like just what I was looking for, slim design and HD video. I bought it from Amazon  and couldn't  wait to try it out. At first I wasn't sure if I liked the new curvy design, but it has grown on me and is functional for holding the camera. The first thing you notice about this camera is the build quality, it is very solid and doesn't feel cheap. The controls are large and well placed, making it easier to use if you have gloves on. The picture quality is good outside in bright sunlight. However, indoors or in low light the picture quality suffers from high ISO noise.  In auto mode the camera doesn't let you force flash to lower the ISO. Even in Program mode with force flash the camera still picked ISO 800 indoors. The picture quality indoors has really bothered me and forced me to only use the D20 outdoors. I have used the camera in the pool without any problems of leaking or water damage. The video from this camera is clear and looks good. It is 1080 at 24fps instead of 30fps, but that doesn't bother me. The audio is another story. When playing back a video you can hear clicks and pops in it. This happens both underwater and out of the water. It ruins the video and makes them useless. I don't know if Canon didn't test this camera before they shipped it, but they should have caught this problem.In summary the camera isn't bad for a waterproof camera.

Utterly disappointed in Canon's response... a manager named Danny offered a very robotic, \"We are just as upset about this as you are, but unfortunately our hands are tied until you return the the USA.\"I did purchase an extended warranty through Mack, however, registering online was not sufficient for service in Mexico without the actual warranty certificate with me.In the future, I will fill out and scan the warranty paperwork, register online, and scan receipt copies into my email and create a folder \"Camera Warranty.\"  That way, if I am ever on a trip and need service, I will have all of the documents needed anywhere in the world.  Btw, I don't know the details, but was advised by Mack (extended warranty) that if I could provide a copy of my certificate, they could offer \"some\" service while I was in Mexico.  They were much easier to work with than Canon... and much more empathetic!Regarding the camera features, I found the button placement to be poor - the shutter button is in an inconvenient spot.  Instead of taking a picture, I would end up reviewing the last picture taken.  The zoom buttons are also inconveniently located. GPS locator is very useful, but turn it off for multiple pics in the same area after you take the first one because it drains the batteries super fast.I have been an SLR and DSLR user for years.  I bought this camera solely for the waterproof (in)capabilities for the whale shark dive, but opted not to take another camera as the reviews on this raved about picture quality.  After a DSLR, I found this camera to be so slow, that I missed the opportunity to take pictures quickly.  If you are used to a point and shoot, this camera may work quite well for you, but for me I have a serious case of post-purchase regret.The package I got included a second backup battery.  Neither the Canon nor the backup battery held a charge very long even with the GPS signal turned off.  I left home with two fully charged batteries and without any use, I had to recharge the second one within 24 hours.Overall, this camera is an incredible disappointment.  I was left without a camera for 8 days of a 9 day dream trip with my sister.

In the past I have tried several Fujis & several Sony waterproof camera, but they all somewhat lacking. The Fujis I don't recommend - the optics & sensors are just too poor. They will do only if you are on a budget. I recently tried the brand new Sony DSC-TX200V & it's a great little camera but the touch screen interface is terrible for using in the water. Mainly as the touch screen doesn't respond well to wet or cold fingers but also the display (even turned up full) is hard to see in the bright sun. So changing shooting options is a real pita. Also, the video record button is only on the touch screen on the Sony, so it can be hard to see or even \"touch\" to activate in the water. Picture & video quality is very good, but usability makes it a frustrating experience.But this review is about the Canon D20. Let me be brief & say it's great - hands down the best water proof point & shoot I have used. This is my new favorite waterproof / summertime digital camera.Canon D20 Pros:Good solid form factor. Some folks say it's too big but I like it. It's still easily pocket sized, but the size of the camera makes it easy to hold & access buttons. After a few minutes you feel very comfortable using this camera.Butons! - So nice to have large, well placed easy to use buttons when under water or in the pool. You can tell Canon really thought about the button placement given the use. The software interface is also very friends for using in the pool and such. Large icons, large text, etc. No squinting to find the right menu.Still quality - very nice. A few blurry shots when I zoomed in but nothing to be alarmed about. Pic were well saturated and crisp. Very little correction if any required. Video quality - Also very sharp & crisp videos. The Video button is well placed & easily marked. Good selection of video sizes also.Canon D20 Cons:Alas there are a few small problems. The first is that the Canon's audio quality is very so so. The Sony produced much higher quality audio on the videos. The Canon seems very muted and underwater you can here strange pops and clicks. Odd. Still, not the end of the world.The Canon can't seem to take digital stills while recording videos. All the Sony's have (for the last few years) been able to take very good still while you are recording video. This is actually really nice to have.There is a \"under water\" setting on the Canon for taking still / videos under water. It seems to basically just shift the colors to account for the extra blue / cyan you get in a pool. Great, expect it fails utterly. I took several vids & pics using the \"underwater\" setting and many without. All the \"underwater\" shots were very red / orange - i think the canon overcompensates. So, nice idea but doesn't work at all. Maybe in a fresh water lake or ocean where there is less \"blue\"?No lens cover feature. When you turn the Sony on/off it slides a little shutter over the lens so you can't touch it & get fingerprints on it. The canon has no such lens covering feature so I was often times cleaning off fingerprints.Summation: The Canon d20 wins.

The Panasonic had better photo quality; slightly better than the Canon D20 despite being an older model.

By looking on pictures I thought it is rubber and metal, but this is not true. The camera survives under the water, and takes pictures under water just fine, and again, this should be the primary purpose of the camera. On the bad side, the LCD glass scratches easily, be careful with it. Also, both LCD and lens glass gets foggy, you should consider buying anti fog spray and use it before submerging. Under the water you should switch to underwater or \"fish\" mode, since the default auto mode will not capture colors correctly. Above the water use auto mode. Finally, LCD is hard to read under water, therefore I had to point the camera to the desired direction and took as many pictures as possible hoping that at least some will be fine, and this approach worked for me.To conclude, this camera is \"junk\", but can survive submerging and can take underwater pictures.

The D10 was purchased for snorkeling but after a torrential downpour ruined my DSLR, it became my only camera for the remainder of that expedition. I never replaced the DSLR - and lest you think I am a casual user, I travel and work on six continents - so capability and dependability are essential for all my devices. The D10 was an impressive general-purpose camera and the D20 is even better. This is NOT just for underwater use. The waterproof nature makes it perfect for any situation where rain and splash are issues, and is also relatively resistant to condensation in humid environments. While on a restaurant table, it demonstrated that it was wine-proof also. The impressive low-light sensitivity makes it perfect for indoor, performance, museums, churches, and other dim environments where flash cannot be used. Unlike the D10, the D20 is flatter so it easily fits in the pocket (D10 was too thick). The D20 has 5x optical zoom which is sufficient for most situations.What would my wish list be for subsequent models? Bring back the ability to fasten the wrist strap on any of the corners so we lefties can change the holding/shooting hand. Smooth our the S-shape of the side so that it more easily slips into the pocket - the current shape often gets caught on fabric especially when tight (e.g. wetsuit). Make it more than 12 mega-pixel. Have more than 5x zoom. But these are not digs at the device, I am totally satisfied with the camera.Bottom line? Excellent general-purpose camera.

After the first day I tried the Canon with no problems.  We did take a MacBook Air and downloaded all pictures/videos after each day just to be sure we didn't lose anything but never had a problem.  The video of the D20 is great for snorkeling among the reefs.  No trying to center on a fish and only get the tail with a single snapshot.  Took many Gig's of video.  Phenomenal color and clarity...even underwater sounds.  D20 far easier to use on video than the D10 which requires fiddling with setting before shooting.  the D20 allows you the go quickly between single shots and video since there is the one button video.  The zoom feature with video is easy to use. Battery life quite adequate.  I did buy the 32G card but never got close to filling it since we downloaded each night. The larger screen is good for my failing sight....I can actually see what I'm shooting.  One drawback: the on/off switch is too close to the shutter button.  Oftentimes I would inadvertently turnoff the camera rather than snap a shot losing the opportunity, especially underwater when you have lots to contend with.

Our adventures included a fair amount of snorkeling, and we wanted to take underwater photos. In the past we used a Canon Elph 400 for this purpose, mounted in a Canon underwater housing. It was a decent rig until it leaked last trip, so we were in the market for a new underwater camera setup. I found this one on Amazon and read a ton of reviews, as well as checking out the latest Olympus, Pentax, Nikon, Panasonic, etc. offerings. I chose this one and am glad I did.1. Menu familiarity. A big part of photo success nowadays is being able to quickly navigate the camera's menu screens and other controls. All of my other photo equipment (DSLR, compacts, camcorders, etc.) are all Canon. The menu system on this camera was immediately familiar.2. Rugged build and a shape that fits my hands. Some others have complained about the shape, but I like it. I also like the rubberized portions which help my grip.3. Photo quality. I took a great number of photos, and I have to say that I just don't get what those who complained of poor photo quality had issue with. A few of them obviously never figured out how to get the camera out of full automatic mode, so they were unable to control the ISO (film speed effective) adjustment. Once again, being familiar with the Canon menu system (or perhaps reading the manual :-) should clear those issues up. This camera is clearly NOT my big Canon SLR with L series glass, but it does compare nicely with my Canon S90 compact. The S90 wins in low light situations, but that is to be expected since it has a lot more lens. This D20 makes up part of the gap by having a sophisticated sensor. It has vivid colors, high resolution, and good contrast. When the light goes down, things get a bit noisy, but I found it all very controllable, either by working the controls, or by Photoshopping later on. In any case, I've shot a lot of small cameras and this one is competitive with the best.4. Video mode. It provided some decent video of a sea turtle in the water and a talking cockatoo at the Hyatt Kaanapali where we were staying. The sound was even OK, so I don't really get some of the negatives from others. It does not have comparable sound to my Vixia with DM30 mic, but that is not really the point of an amphibious camera, IMHO. This is good enough for what it is.5. View screen. Bright, clear, scratch resistant. I was able to take better pictures than in the past simply because this screen is big and bright enough to use while snorkeling in a sunny place.NOTES: I replaced the standard strap/leash with a \"Chums\" floatable leash. This is enough to float this camera and give you a bit of peach of mind. I attached it to the opposite side of where the normal strap/leash attachment is so I would not have anything protruding from the bottom of the camera. There is a place there where a shoulder strap or some such thing is supposed to attach.I used this camera underwater in the ocean, in the pool, under the fake Hyatt water fall, and on dry land.

This is no longer included in the D-20 and you have to manually change the ISO.  It's also now several steps to even get to the place that you can change the ISO!  By the time you change it the action is over and you've missed the shot.  I've also found that the \"auto\" feature is slower than it was on the D-10 which rarely, if ever, gave me blurry shots, this one tends to do it more often than not.  I was really bummed by the changes.  They added features (like more filters), but overall, my D-10 was better.  Also, my D-10 was so great that after seven years it was still working perfect and GOT STOLEN!  :(  I felt like a loss a friend.  The one advantage to this D-20 is that it's slimmer.  Another change that irritated me was that you used to be able to attach the strap to any corner...for a lefty this is perfect.  Now, you can only attach to the right.

This means that where you would typically hold the edge of a camera you now cover the lens just a bit with the tip of your finger--I've had several shots ruined by the tip of my finger.

Coleman", "ReviewID": "R281F0YQK3XVXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While I have yet to receive my Canon PowerShot D20, I have received the \"Extended Warranty Policy\" (SquareTrade.com) documents which I purchased with the camera. Since many underwater cameras often have a high rate of failure due to water leakage I opted for the extended warranty, just in case I had a problem within the first two years. Unfortunately, the policy expressly does NOT cover \"water immersion\"? What? This is an UNDERWATER CAMERA! Immersion is the whole point of buying one!Not only is immersion not covered but any \"act of nature or any other peril originating from outside the product.\" is also expressly not covered. Is that sidewalk you just dropped it on outside the camera? Ok, the policy does say that dropping IS covered, so you can likely drop it and not worry, but since the camera is also shock resistant you may or may not think you need that insurance in the first place.If however you put in a claim for water leakage they don't have to do anything for you. When I called to cancel the policy they of course tried to talk me into keeping the policy, but given the undeniable terms of the \"agreement\" I could already envision the conversation I would be having if I had to file a claim for the same reason I bought the policy. You can of course trust them to honour their side of the agreement, but I don't personally put much faith in it since its all in black-and-white that they don't have to. Your mileage of course may vary.btw - My rating on this camera is only a four star simply because I do not yet have an opinion on the camera itself. I love Canon's products, as I already have three great SLR's. I have surveyed the market and this D20 looks like the best camera for the price given the tradeoffs needed for it to be water proof.

Great water protection. Used it for reef pictures and videos around 2-3 meters deep and  the seal stayed perfect.Cons---------1. Flash is super slow to recharge. If you bought this camera, you will be using this on a beach or a sunny area for sure. In bright light situations such as beaches, you must turn on the flash for most photos or else you will get overexposed shots due to sunlight. Unfortunately this Canon camera takes like 3-4 seconds to recharge the flash after each photo! Reminds me of the 1990s and Nintendo NES nostalgia.  Seriously Canon, are we still in the 21st century or not? I don't know what the designers were thinking here.2. The colored metallic area is all show and very prone to scratches. They should have stayed with 100% rubber all around the cause and not use cheap alloy metal plate for marketing purposes.3. The alloy/metallic screws that hold the camera together are not salt water rust proof. Yes you heard that right, a camera that's designed for under water photos has screws that aren't 100% rust proof when it comes to salt ocean water. What I mean is that if you used the camera in the ocean, make sure you  rinse it under fresh water afterwards or you will get yellowing/rusting of the screws a few days later.4. Heavy. The size is not bulky and actually quite nice but it sure feels like holding on to a rock.Summary---------Look, this is an very average camera at best with great water protection. When it comes to waterproof cameras, consumers don't have many choices and Canon D20 is already one of the best in the field but unfortunately when compared to regular non-waterproof cameras, image quality and photo shooting features are mediocre at best and highway rubbery at worst considering the cost premium over much better non-waterproof cameras.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "fantastic camera", "Author": "nnevison", "ReviewID": "R1FQ34OEVZE1ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "of my gosh.

So keep that in mind.I bought this camera after doing very little research because I had a kayaking trip come up unexpectedly. I really wanted to be sure to get pictures on my trip, but I wasn't willing to take my Canon Rebel. Since I had never kayaked before, I was not sure if I would turn my kayak over during my initiation to kayaking. So I knew I had to get a waterproof camera.I am a Canon fan, so naturally that is where I began my search. From the very short time I spent on the internet reading reviews and reading information about this camera, it seemed like this was the camera I would buy. I did look at other waterproof cameras, but decided to stick to what I knew. I knew that thus far, Canon has not disappointed me.The problem I ran into was I had to buy the camera THAT DAY because I was leaving early the next morning for my trip. And it seemed like every place I called did not have this camera in stock. I did finally find it and was happy with my purchase.So, my unprofessional opinion is this:Pros:I took the camera out of the box, charged the battery, put the battery in and left for my trip. I didn't change any of the settings. All I did was pull the camera out when I got in my kayak and started shooting. I posted some of my pics here and I am pleased with what I got. And that was my goal - to get what I consider \"good pictures\".I like that it is approved for a depth up to 33ft. Some of the other waterproof cameras I came across were only approved for up to 16ft.I don't think it requires you to read all the instructions to be able to use the camera right out of the box. In my opinion, it is very user-friendly.I did not actually take an underwater picture. So I can not speak for how the camera performed under water. But I had to have an underwater camera specifically because obviously it could have ended up in the water. So I wanted it so I would not have to worry about the camera getting ruined by splashes or by an unexpected swim in the ocean. And obviously I wanted it to be good enough to take better than average photos. So for my needs, it exceeded my expectations.Cons:In comparison to other waterproof cameras, in general this Canon D20 was slightly larger/bulkier. And the shape of the camera is still puzzling to me. I held my hand all kinds of ways and could not figure out why the curved shape on the side of the camera you hold with your left hand. At first, it almost encouraged my left index finger to place itself in front of the lens.The price was a bit high. However, I did find it n sale for the same price as Amazon, but had to \"fight\" for a price match at the place I found it. I like buying from Amazon, but that was not a possibility since I needed it the next day.I do not like how the button you press to snap pics is in between two other buttons - one being the power button. Granted, it is a bigger button that than the other two buttons, I still hit one of the other buttons several times when I meant to snap a picture.I do not know if this is the norm, but it was a bit concerning to me that there is no lens cover. Well, I guess since it is waterproof, there probably is a glass or plastic cover over the lens, but I would like there to be some sort of shield that would cover the lens so it would not get scratched. Only time will tell if this will be an issue.The pictures seem to come out well-lit, even in bad lighting. However, when I was pointing the camera toward a brighter background (i.e.. the ocean), it messed up the exposure of the pictures and they came out a bit washed-out.Yes, I did point out more cons than pros. But I feel like my \"cons\" are more \"user-preferences/nonpreferences\". As far as camera performance, I am very happy with my purchase.I will add more to my review as I use the camera over time.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the outdoors &

I was a little hesitant as there weren't many reviews of this camera, specifically video or pictures using the camera in the environments I would (ie, pool, underwater, water park rides, etc). However, based on the very good written reviews provided here by some of the earlier adopters of this camera and a few videos on YouTube I decided to buy it and I'm so glad I did!! I wanted the camera before Memorial day so I purchased the expedited shipping and it arrived May 25th(purchased May 24th). I was super excited to get this camera in the water and I did just that on Saturday at the pool with my daughter and friends we also took it with us to Sea Worlds Aquatica Water Park on Monday and captured some awesome pictures and video.Con: Has background clicking noises while filming under water and don't know what causes it. Also the sound under water isn't to great. Another issue that I didn't like is that although I do not have to stop recording to take a picture, once the picture is taken it doesn't resume recording.Pros: I like that the camera automatically adjusts to your surroundings with lighting, darkness and capture awesome video and pictures without you having to constantly change the cameras settings. I also like having dedicated buttons for recording, on/off, video/picture playback and a button to take pictures. I also like the fact that the camera was ready to take pictures right out of the box (after charging the battery which doesn't take long).Overall this is an AWESOME camera and I love using it. I'm sure I'll update my review as I get more use out of the camera. I love the image and video quality both in and out of the water.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera buttons stopped responding after an hour", "Author": "Craig Iskowitz \"ezragroup.net\"", "ReviewID": "RM24DQ8OQ0FTE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because we were planning a trip to the beach.

M \"M M\"", "ReviewID": "R26FVVPCZA1KGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this last week. I wanted a smart point-n-shoot to replace my larger Olympus 4.0 megapixel C-765. It must have been one of the first digital cameras. It also still works. But it's big, dated, and doesn't do video, obviously. In Maui I need small, durable  with video and waterproof. I also need a camera smarter then it's operator.  This new one takes a 16G SD card. It still has about 2/3rds the room after 1,058 pictures and a good half-dozen videos. I DO recommend a spare battery upfront. I've yet to regret this decision. It's also about half-charged when you get it. I'd also say delete as you go along. Sorting through 1,058 pix at once is a PITA if you can avoid it.  I bought this at Calumet Camera on Chicago's 1111 Cherry Street, where Division comes into Halsted. We also have to support the little guy every once in awhile, lest all the small stores go away. I was getting confused with too much info and just wanted a nice, durable camera. That's what I got. I wanted professional advice, got that, too.  Also, I wanted to help Americans keep their jobs, as well as not support any anti-American activities. Know the company you are dealing with. Watch \"The Corporation.\" Lots of popular companies use American business and American money to support terrorism. Brick stores cost more money than a site. But you get what you pay for. A Pinto is a car, too, but you can't compare it to a Maserati. And while I never drove a Pinto, thank God, I have driven a Maserati. Trust me, I'm sure it's better than driving a Pinto. But again, if you don't care or can't differentiate, then don't bother with the extra expense.  Camera does NOT come with an SD card. At all. Buy the spare battery now.  As I said, so far, I like it very much. I kind of hate having to sort through 9,000 reviews by people who could just be well, idiots. I always read the 1-star first, and see if it has any merit at all.  Ok, this does a very nice point-n-shoot. I use the wrist strap so I won't have to find out how durable it really is. It also does nice FX like miniature and so on. I never use a flash, except as an effect, NOT as an excuse for not going and finding a light. I'm with Stanley Kubrick on a flash being the work of satan, basically.  Charging, be aware a dead-to-full charge is about 2 hours. If you're really going somewhere photogenic, make sure you don't forget that. In 1,058 pix, I charged three times. First was for the 1/2 charge battery that was as I got it. I don't leave it on standby too long.  I must have about half a dozen short vids, also.  Try to compare it to your normal camera at the store. With your iphone or your old camera. If you're not impressed at the store, then don't do it. I compared this to the new, NEW, Boost Mobile HTC One sv. The Canon wins by a long shot. The Canon is cleaner and brighter, with better color. A pro photographer told me he really loves the iphone camera. There's a ringing endorsement. And perhaps a worthy comparison?  Bu going further, what do you want it to do? Take a pic? Be durable? Waterproof? Do vids? Be sharp and clean? If you just need a phone to ring, you don't have to bother with a very expensive iphone. If you're fussy, then you'll be happier with this than junk.  Take two pics of the same thing with both cameras under identical conditions, and see what you like.  Oh, there are NO instructions. Printing them yourself took me a LOOOOONNNG time. There are, no kidding, 220 double-sided pages, literally. So you can either print or memorize. There's a lot for a camera with 8 buttons. It DOES come with a data cable, which is real nice. I was told to use a card reader if you have a slot or a USB adaptor to put the SD card in.  Battery pops out when you gently pop the red tab inside the door on the bottom, then the SD card is easier to access, as it's next to the battery. Push it down a bit, and it will pop up.  I was accidentally shutting it off, as it's next to the shoot button. A lot of it is self-explanatory. But after 220 pages, I see that it does much more than I know about now. This is precisely what I wanted, and I'm very happy with it. I will try to put up some nice pix.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot D20 - Well Worth the $$$", "Author": "Toys_n_Games", "ReviewID": "RHCL80LS1SQWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow  I am totally shocked at how well this camera preforms.  Is it the perfect camera for every situation?  No.  Is it a good alternative to SLR, No.  But for what it is designed for, size and price, this camera over performs.  Well done Canon!For everyday normal use this camera does rather well.  You have to be diligent about wiping\\cleaning the attached clear lens cover as it easily steams, fogs or smears.  No, it does not come off, not intentionally.  Water droplets tend to stick or leave a wavy trails.  Keep a microfiber cloth always at hand and you'll be just fine.  Menu system took a little while to get use to but that goes with just about any new camera.Oddities...  The shutter button is centered between the ON\\Off and Play buttons on top of the camera.  I hit Play on numerous occasions when I didn't want to.  You have to reach a little further than what you would expect to pop off a snap.  Again, just something you have to get use to.Separate Wide and Zoom buttons not particularly fluid.  I prefer a rocker button.  Train your fingers and you'll be OK.The good...  Indoor, outdoor and low light images are great bordering on fantastic.  Does pretty well on the Fireworks setting too.  Gives other PowerShot models a run for the money.The awesome...  Underwater.  Excellent pics even when not using the underwater setting.  Of course distance from your subject is dependent on the clarity of the water but in normal, clear pool water 4 to 8 feet seems about right.  The one drawback is that it is nearly impossible to watch the LCD screen to center your subject.  Point and shoot doesn't really describe the necessary action.  Guess and shoot would be better.  Wearing goggles or a mask would help but I haven't had the luxury yet.Take LOTS of underwater shots.  You'll get lots of butts, legs and empty water shots but with a little practice you'll get your subject.  Maybe not perfectly centered but that is what resizing and cropping is for.1000 + pictures and video taken so far and haven't touched the Program\\Manual setting - haven't had the need.5 Stars because I bought this for water park pictures and it is that and much, much more.

The new model doesn\u2019t offer a new lens, sensor, or processor, so photo quality and performance should be similar.The one thing about the D20 that stands out is that it is built like a tank.  Everything feels well put together and the buttons and doors all feel high quality.  The doors have silicone seals to keep out water, click shut tightly, and have spring-loaded releases to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally open them underwater.  The D20 is a bit larger than you might expect and has decent heft to it, but it\u2019s never a problem to carry around all day or stash in a bathing suit pocket.  The Canon feels good in the hand and all the buttons are large and easy to use.  The shutter button is a little spongy, however, and watch where you place your fingers as they are easy to get into the photo.Included with the Canon is a heavy-duty wrist strap that can be attached on the right hand side or the bottom left corner with the included snap on holder.  The problem with attaching it on the bottom left corner is that the Canon will not stand upright when the strap is attached this way.The D20 is very simple to use.  For those who want the camera to do all of the work for them there is the smart automatic mode.  It tries to figure out what you\u2019re taking a photo of to create the most pleasing result.  There are also a handful of scene modes and creative filters.  For those who want a little more control there is a program mode, a long shutter mode with options from 1\u201d to 15\u201d, and custom white balance available.Performance wise the Canon is average.  It takes 1\u201d to focus in good light and about 2\u201d to focus in low light.  It turns on quickly, however, and is ready to shoot in 3\u201d.  Continuous shooting speeds are about 1 photo every second and I took 40 photos before I stopped, but the Canon could keep going.  Moreover it only took a couple of seconds to write those photos to the memory card and be ready to shoot again.  The screen gets a little jerky when continuous shooting but it\u2019s not hard to follow your subject.  The D20\u2019s GPS works well and takes only a couple of minutes to acquire a signal.Picture quality is very good for a waterproof camera, but the Canon is let down by its 5x lens.  The lens is very slow (f/3.9 - f4.8), which means that it can\u2019t collect a lot of light, resulting in higher ISO speeds and lower photo quality.  Some cameras in this class offer an f/2.0 lens (the lower the f/ number the more light the lens can collect).  Additionally, the lens is blurry in the extreme corners and shows a bit of purple fringing and vingetting.  The lens does have an image stabilizer, however, so you can keep ISO speeds down when taking photos of static subjects, and I was able to get sharp shots at 1/4\" at wide angle.  Outside of the lens\u2019 negatives, the Canon takes nice photos.  Color, exposure, and contrast are all good.  The photos are bit soft on close inspection, but detail remains high even as ISO speeds rise.  I would recommend shooting from ISO 100-400 ideally, 800 when necessary, and 1600-3200 in emergencies.  Lastly the maximum shutter speed is only 1/1600\u201d.Videos are recorded in full HD at 24fps with monaural sound.  I found the video quality to be high and you\u2019re able to use the optical zoom, although you will hear the motor in quiet environments.Battery life is good.  I took over 100 photos, a few videos, zoomed a lot and played with the menu and the battery only half depleted (all while the GPS was on).I used the Canon in water and didn\u2019t have any issues with leaks.  Make sure you check the seals for any debris before going underwater, and rinse the camera in mild tap water after each use underwater.  By following these simple rules you can make sure the Canon will last a long time.All in all\u2026 a nicely designed waterproof camera that deserves a better lens.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fun camera, amazing image quality", "Author": "FrankeO-57", "ReviewID": "R37MO8PDJSWTFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is possibly one of the best water proof cameras out there.

Good image quality (IQ) for a waterproof camera (Sorry, IQ really is relative as non-waterproof point-and-shoot (PNS) cameras at this price point have far better IQ). My D20 handles continuous bouncing in my front pocket while trail running with no problems yet after about 6 months of solid use. 50 to 100+ miles of bouncing in my front pocket or backpack so far. I love the Color Swap effect mode as well. I have not submerged it yet but it has been rained on many times without incident.So this brings me to the D30. I cannot find anything different with it other than the case (and modest button layout change) and depth rating from the D20.

And I have to admit, I can't stand the D20's case as it's got a very awkward shape and it is very slippery. I literally smeared Shoe Goo all over the front and sides of it for grip. My girlfriend HATES the way it looks now but has to admit it solved the slip problem. The D30 addresses the slipperiness of the D20 with an actual finger grip on the front. Plus the D30 has a totally different depth rating of 82 feet, which is 49 feet deeper than the D20's 33 feet. This is something that really interests me as I had a Lumix TS3 fatally leak at literally under 8 INCHES submersion shooting video in a koi pond while being rated for 40 feet. Depth ratings are lies and all I need is a genuine, no-excuses-never-ever-fail-for-any-reason depth rating of 10 feet.

Walker", "ReviewID": "R3AIVPXXDDDZMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a home inspector, so I got this camera because it wouldn't care about crawlspaces, rain (like today), etc.  I use the camera in VERY extreme environments and it has to perform.  In general, I have not been disappointed.  I had the D10 before this one.  The D10 was flaky.  I had well over 60,000 pic's on it (yep.. at least).  It took forever to focus and shoot and would randomly shoot out of focus.  The D20 is much faster in this regard.  So far very few out of focus shots.  The D10 also had a hard time focusing in dusty areas (like a dry crawlspace).  The D20 suffers the same issue.  It seems a little more forgiving in that regard though.  I think this has something to do with the underwater focusing mode, but am not sure.Where I see a future issue coming with the D20 is the battery/memory card door.  The latch and door is a plastic material.  The door latch is very difficult to operate.  The D10 had a metal door and was much simpler to open.  I can see this breaking at some point in time.  But only time will tell.All in all, it seems like a decent camera.  The normal lens has wider coverage than the D10.  The zoom is much faster to respond.  The D10 was very thick/bulky.  The lens really stuck out on it.  The D20 is much smaller - relatively speaking that is.  It is still much larger than a non-weatherproof camera.  I am sorry I didn't purchase an extended warranty when I bought it.  The door seems likely to break and I'd rather fix than replace.

I paid a little more, even duty-free, than it costs here, but I'm still happy. We took pictures of our whole week-long vacation with this camera, and most of the pics came out pretty great. We even took it on our snorkeling adventure, and used it to get pics and video of the fish, coral, turtles, and each other, while in the ocean. It is definitely rugged, it pinpoints where you take the pics (you can turn that features off pretty easily), and upload is a breeze (SD card, NO USB). No, it isn't a super-high-quality fancy-shmancy deal, but it certainly gets the job done, and is easy to operate. Neither my husband nor I are any kind of photographer, but we were able to get pretty decent pics in all kinds of conditions- from the night club to our tiny inside cabin, to the beach. And what's more, I feel OK letting my kids grab this camera and take some pics, because I'm not worried they'll break it or mess anything up. It is really rugged. I take it to Water Country USA all the time, the park, the local pool, and out in the snow or rain or whatever, without worrying.Finally, my favorite bonus features is that it has a rechargeable battery. I really hate having to replace camera batteries, or running low just when you leave the house. It's been more than a year since I bought this camera now, and it still holds a good charge. I seldom charge it, but it seems to last a good long time with normal use. Video is a simple button-push, zoom is easy enough for my toddler to figure out, and although I rarely mess with any settings, they're pretty straight-forward when you want to change something.I highly recommend this camera for folks with young kids, anyone going on a cruise or beach vacation, or anybody who just wants a good, reliable camera that can be taken anywhere.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this Water Proof Camera", "Author": "Manfredo", "ReviewID": "RJWXZRCSKY4QE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good resolution it is all that you need if you need take pictures under water with very good quality. 5x optical zoom its enough if you want to take a pictures making snorkel.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that there are many cameras and makers that deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and find out what else is available for your specific need.The Canon D20 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and a x5 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CMOS-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 3200. That rating is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need that only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 1.9 frames per second- for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 228 grams.Canon D20 comes with GPS, it is waterproof to 33 feet of depth, freezeproof, and shockproof.Overall, a fun camera for the outdoors.

Those two retailers have such permanent mind-share that whenever I have a purchase need, I think of Costco first and Amazon mostly second.  No brainer.This past Sunday, December 22nd I completed a little side job and deposited some cash into my personal checking account so that I could eventually order a replacement camera on Monday.  I was scheduled to take a friend to the airport at 5am and when I returned at 6am I placed my order.So, after many years of being a professional commercial and stock photographer, the economy and economics of maintaining my six-figure camera quiver had been whittled down to my smart phone and a PNS (point and shoot).  I originally purchased a cool little Canon D10 that was waterproof and adventure tolerant.  The shape of the camera was a little bulky so I upgraded to the new Canon D20.  The sensor was much better and the the shape was more pocket friendly.I lost this camera by leaving it on the roof of my car in a remote area and as I recalled my error, I was 30 miles down the road.  Upon return to the scene of my idiocy, the camera was long gone.So, after this last little job and with my previous research, I was 100% planning to purchase the Olympus TG-2.  It looked sexy and just pretty much awesome for $329.  On Amazon, the designated vendor was Samy's Camera in NYC.  Not a fan and for no particular reason.  But, since I was not really going through Amazon I visited the Adorama website.  If I purchase camera gear outside of Amazon, I prefer B&H; or Adorama.  BTW, I had received a $50 gift certificate to Amazon which was influencing my final decision process.  Adorama was offering overnight free shipping for the same price as the Amazon price via Samy's.  I was JUST ABOUT to pull the trigger and then I went back and compared the specs of the Canon D20 and the Olympus TG-2.  With the exception of the Olympus being much sexier and probably having a better bomb-proof rating, the actually camera specs were about the same as the Canon D20 for $100 less money.  Mind you, all this comparative analysis is going on at 6am in the morning with 3 hours of sleep.I go back to the Amazon site and confirm the lesser price of the D20.  I really did want to try a new camera but for an extra hundy?  THEN, on the Amazon site it tells me if the order is placed by 9am, I am guaranteed same day delivery...that means like that same day!As far as a camera review, this is a great little camera...I always post-process my images in Adobe Bridge (I have a quick post-processing workflow) and with very little effort I get great shots.  Low light and action shots are not it's strong point.  Video and underwater shots are great.  The newer shape (versus the D10) are easy to throw in a pocket or the back of my cycling jersey.

I bought this to replace a Canon D10 that was about 3 years old and leaking.  I was VERY pleased at the new features of the D20 over the D10.  This has pretty much the same features that the S95 has but not all the manual controls.  It's sturdy and waterproof to 30' but you have to make sure you keep the seals clean to ensure you don't leak.  Don't use anything with lint to clean the battery or digital compartment doors as the lint will make a leak if caught in the seals.  I've dropped it a bunch of times and had no issues.If you take in the pool or saltwater just soak in in fresh water for about 15 mins and then dry it before opening the battery or data port.Feature and quality wise this is the top of the line waterproof camera on the market. Again, it's only rated to 30'  and if I'm deeper than that I use the Canon S110 in a dive housing.The buttons and functions are all easy to use with gloves on and the logic of all the function menus are much easier than other similar cameras.The picture quality is exceptional and the battery life is about 500 pictures. The video is good but the video sound is not as it's in a waterproof case.  All waterproof cameras have this problem.There is a good underwater color correction mode that works fine and it actually is a great all around camera even is you arent' around water.It's definitely a little bigger than other point and shoots but it's very sturdy.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Low Light and Night Pictures.", "Author": "EB", "ReviewID": "R2INEG41Z7WYLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so Great with this Camera.

The photos were good but colors were a little muted relative to colors I was observing. Make sure you rinse sand/salt off with fresh water after swim.Land photos were good for the most part. One complaint is that in Auto exposure, you cannot force a flash it only has auto flash and no flash. There are times, especially when out in the sun where you need a flash fill.

I adore that camera, and it takes better images than most new cameras, but it was time to retire it and the massive case.I looked at all the options on the market, and I seriously considered the Panasonic.  The image quality reviews are a bit better than the canons.  Ultimately, though, I went with this one due to a noticeably higher number of water seal failures noted in the Panasonic reviews.  I've also stuck with Canons exclusively through many camera purchases, and the familiarity of the controls and menus was a small factorPros:- Size isn't tiny, but it's less than 1/3rd of the volume of my old S30 + case.  Still small enough to put in a pocket.- All controls easily accessible.  With the case products, some controls aren't easy to hit.Cons:- The two  options for attaching the wrist strap are kind of bizarre.  Either on the right side on an annoyingly placed removable attachment - this makes it impossible to set on its bottom for self-shots or other needs.  Option two is on the left side, which might be a little unwieldy for a right hander.- Screen is pretty much invisible underwater, even on full brightness.  Not sure how other cameras fare, but probably similarly.- The shutter button and power button are right next to each other on the top.  Both are round.  You will inevitably turn your camera off instead of taking the shot you want.  Repeatedly.  It's a little frustrating, but at least the camera turns back on fast.I've taken this on two snorkeling trips with maybe 6-7 salt water immersion / drying cycles.

Yes, its a little funky to look at and they do have better looking waterproof cameras but this one feels sturdy. I used it on a jet ski. The wrist strap proved invaluable when I flipped off into the ocean and the camera was still strapped on. Note: The camera does NOT float. Back to sturdy- chances are when you are in a water environment the camera is going to bang around and possibly be dropped- no worries here. The metal body and rubber grips are great. Buttons are large enough. The funky curve on the side does fit your finger nicely.The picture quality was great- some complain- cant figure out why. I have always shot Canon and especially love their Digital Elphs dating back from years ago. The Power Shot line is excellent. The thing I noticed was that they pictures were always crisp and never under exposed. It compensated with flash more times that I would have personally but it made the subject just pop.The HD video works great as well.

So far so good. It is everything I expected based on my user experience with the D10.  It take a little getting used to the controls being switched up a bit, but that is minor. So far I'm liking the improved packaging, with the exception of the thumb rest on the back of the camera. It is a little too easy to press the zoom instead of the thumb rest when taking pictures, especially if you have long and big fingers. I do like the visual cues on the compartment doors to let you know they're locked.  That certainly would have saved my D10 (although I think the seals are worn on that one) Gone are the multi-ports for the wrist strap attachment, but in its place is a single anchor point, which is the only one I ever used on my D10 anyway, so it worked out well.Refresh rates seem quite good and fast between shots. With the same battery pack used as on my old D10, it was great to know I did not have to stock up on spares again!  Battery life is still less than I would like, but the batteries are quick to charge and if you have spares, your day will go great. The larger HD screen is another nice touch, and the auto rotation is very slick.

My worst criticism is that the lens is right in the location where I wanted to hold the camera during taking video of going through rapids on the Colorado.

The biggest downfall was I could not see the preview screen underwater so I had to aim blindly and shoot. Picture quality was so-so. Due to the inability to see the preview screen on this camera on the next outing I used an older Kodak Easyshare with an optical viewfinder that I considered expendable and bought a DiCaPak case. The DiCaPak case worked as advertised and with the optical viewfinder I was able to see what I was shooting. Biggest downside was the controls were hard to operate and the battery on the camera didn't last long. Photo quality was much improved but not great. Wanting something better I did some more research and ended up buying the Canon PowerShot D20. My biggest fear was without the optical viewfinder I again would not be able to see what I was taking a picture of - this was not the case as the preview screen was easy to see underwater. The camera absolutely worked as advertised and underwater picture quality was excellent. That said this camera is what it is and that's a rugged waterproof camera you can take anywhere. I consider the above water pictures I took with this camera to be average for a point and shoot - nowhere near what I get with my Nikon D60, but then again I didn't expect them to be. I bought this camera for underwater use and those pictures came out fantastic. Color was great and the pictures were extremely sharp. Even used in underwater macro mode with great results.

It's my go to camera for snorkeling or in adverse weather conditions.  It has never failed me except for one minor detail that took me a bit of time to resolve.  Before I bought the camera I had read owner reviews which described  a lens error problem - in fact one owner returned the camera because he couldn't eliminate the problem.  If the lens error appears the camera is rendered useless.  I didn't experience the problem until recently.I can reproduce the problem when the camera is in the playback mode - simply press the shutter button and the lens error appears.  I'm sure that this has happened to others by accident.  The way to resolve the problem is to turn off the camera, remove the battery for a few minutes, replace the battery and turn on the camera.  Repeat if it doesn't clear the first time, wait a few more minutes before replacing the battery.It may be a minor annoyance but the camera is not broken.Other than that minor issue the camera has been flawless within its limits - as has been noted by others this is not an expensive DSLR and does have limitations.

I took plenty of land photos before heading out to snorkel and it worked just fine. I'm used to canon camera's and picture were as expected.I took 4 pictures while snorkeling before the camera showed a message requesting to restart the camera.  I restarted and took 2 more pictures before the screen froze with just a few lines showing up briefly and then it went black.  I tried to turn it back on while in the water but it wouldn't turn on.  I didn't bother with it anymore after that until we returned to the hotel room.  I took a good look at the camera before opening any doors and was able to see water in the lens.  Enough water to tilt the camera different ways and make it look like one of those globes with a little boat on water and blue oil.  The camera had been out of the water for about 30/45 minutes at this point and the screen had condensation built up on the inside.I tried to check if I didn't seal something right, but the doors were all shut, no red on the door clip was visible and doors were properly aligned.  I opened the battery/card door first and water was present throughout the compartment, on the battery, on the card and the door.  I opened the media door and water was present throughout this compartment also. I ejected battery and the sd card and water was visible on all sides of both. I wiped dry what I could and left the camera to dry in the room which was kept cool.  The camera has not successfully powered on yet and my rental period ends tomorrow 5/29. I was able to confirm that the sd card was not damaged and all pictures were present; including the 6 pictures from the snorkeling trip (it's a Kingston card, which I now fully recommend).This camera isn't supposed to be an ordinary point and shoot. It's supposed to be able to take a bit more of a licking and survive in the water.  It didn't work out for me.  We never made it past about 7 feet of water when this incident happened and the length of time in the water was about 5-10 minutes.  I like Canon camera's.  It's a shame this one didn't work out.
