{"Reviews": [{"Title": "20x Pocket Zoom Comparison - Panasonic ZS19 (ZS 20 w/o GPS) vs. Canon SX260 vs. Sony HX20V", "Author": "Artemaria", "ReviewID": "R1NOGNJOBO5VAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't decide between these three cameras (and their variants, the Sony HX30 and the Panasonic ZX20) because many of the reviews of each made the cameras sound very similar. So, I went out and bought (from merchants who accepted returns) one of each of these three cameras (I didn't need WI-FI or GPS, so that's how I settled on these less expensive variants). And then I took photos and videos in various conditions. I am not a professional photographer, and I didn't do Imatest or any other specific tests on the images (you can read C/net for that), but this is an experience of a regular person who was taking pictures and videos with these three cameras side by side, which is a comparison that you do not often see.The bottom line is that these three cameras are very similar with a few minor differences, but those differences set them apart and may make you decide that you like one more than the other.Generally speaking, NONE of these cameras is a DSLR replacement. Whomever writes that the pictures are as good as a DSLR is not speaking accurately. Also, none of the cameras is a replacement for a high end camcorder.OUTSIDE PICTURESIf you are taking pictures outside on a sunny day all of these cameras will take very nice pictures for small to medium enlargements (no bigger than 8 x 10). The cameras all produce nice fairly sharp images that would be well suited for that purpose. And, like most people, I don't remember ever enlarging a picture more than 8 x 10, so it is not a common problem.What might be an issue is if you are zoomed in all the way and wanted to crop a photo (which sometimes happens), the differences in the way the cameras' photos look when you \"pixel peep\" might make a difference. In good light outside, the cameras were close, but the best photos were from the CANON with the SONY and the PANASONIC a close second.INSIDE PICTURES - GOOD LIGHTIf you are inside and you are taking pictures in low light, you will see a different story. Again, at smaller sized prints 4x6, 5x7, most people will see almost no difference between the pictures of the three cameras other than the PANASONIC's colors are a little less vibrant than those in the CANON and the SONY. I am not sure whether those colors are less accurate, they are just a little less vivid.If you pixel peep at these pictures, the CANON's photos are clearly the best with the PANASONIC's being second. The CANON's remain very sharp through a good amount of enlargement while the PANASONIC's, although close, get softer a little faster. The SONY's pictures inside with good light became soft rather quickly and, I'm not sure if this is because the SONY has 18MP on a small chip (as some of the tech reviewers write), but there is a \"watercolor\" effect where after you enlarge it a little bit, it looks like a Claude Manet painting.INSIDE PICTURES - LOW LIGHTIn poor light, the hierarchy between the cameras remains the same, but there is less of a gap between the CANON and the PANASONIC. It seems as if the CANON takes somewhat worse pictures in low light, and the PANASONIC just doesn't get that much worse. As a result, the gap between these two becomes somewhat closer. The SONY's pictures remain the poorest of the three in low light.VIDEO - OUTSIDE GOOD LIGHTAll three cameras take very nice video outside in good light. If you are editing or nitpicky, you will note that the SONY and the PANASONIC take 60 frames per second, which is somewhat easier to edit, than the 24 frames per second that the CANON records. While you have to look for it, the CANON's outside video does have a couple of instances where it seems to be a tad jerky compared to the SONY and PANASONIC's video. But you really have to look for it and most people won't notice if you don't have another video outside for comparison.While all the outdoor video is close, I would give the edge to the SONY in video, with the PANASONIC second and the CANON third. But they are close for outside video.VIDEO - INSIDETaking video inside is a different story. Inside, the SONY shines and clearly has the best video. The video from this camera is actually good. It is not professional level by any stretch, but it is good solid quite viewable video from a camera that takes still pictures.There is a noticeable difference on indoor video between the SONY and the PANASONIC. This difference was perhaps most noticeable to me because I had both videos from both cameras and watched them over and over again looking for differences. While the difference is noticeable, it is not a tremendous difference. The SONY video is super smooth and seems to get as much out of the light as it can. The PANASONIC video also is smooth and gets a good contrast tone and color out of the available light, but is slightly less smooth than the SONY. The PANASONIC video is still very viewable and looks good, but not as good as the SONY.The CANON will take decent indoor video in good light, but in poor light, it just seems to struggle. The CANON's video had many shadows and dark areas that simply were not present in the SONY and PANASONIC videos. I did not notice any hissing in the CANON video as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. This may be an issue that varies from camera to camera.HANDLING AND SPEEDThis was a fairly subjective comparison between the three cameras as to how they felt in the hand and how quickly the camera did what I wanted it to do because if the camera doesn't take the shot when you want to, it doesn't really matter how sharp the picture or video might be.Based on my experience, the PANASONIC had the best handling of the three. While the PANASONIC and the SONY were both quick to take a picture, for some reason the SONY that I had would take a much longer time (seconds) to record the picture onto the card. This was despite the fact that both cameras had comparable cards with comparable write speeds. Both the SONY and the PANASONIC had rather quick autofocus which also made them seem to react faster. The PANASONIC is noticeably thinner and lighter than the SONY while maintaining a similar full raised rubber grip on the front which made the camera easier to handle. While both the SONY and the PANASONIC were quick, the blazingly fast (by comparison) write speeds on the PANASONIC compared with its almost non-existent shutter lag made this the best handling camera of the three by far.Even though it consistently took the best pictures, the CANON was the worst handling camera. The autofocus often had issues focusing and there was a constant shutter lag while it was searching for its focus. We did miss some shots because the CANON was so slow to react. Also, the CANON is somewhere in weight between the SONY and the PANASONIC, but has the worst grip of the three. That little rubber strip on the front is not as effective a grip as the fuller grip that appears on the SONY and the PANASONIC.With respect to handling, I've read many reviews and each of them seems to state different things about each of the cameras. Many of these reviews seem to indicate that the SONY is a very fast camera, and that might be the case, but the write speed of the 18 MP pictures (which are 50% larger than the CANON's photos and almost the same for the PANASONIC) was so slow, it was distracting and detracted from the experience of using the camera.VERDICT AND CONCLUSIONSNone of these cameras is the best at everything. The CANON has the best pictures, but is slow to focus, somewhat awkward to handle and has the worst video of the three. The SONY handles okay but is heavy and has noticeably slow write speeds, its picture quality varies greatly with the light (and will deteriorate rapidly with any significant cropping) but the SONY has the best video, and it is noticeable.In the end I decided to go with the PANASONIC. While it only was the best in handling, to me that was a significant portion of the photographic experience. It is not DSLR fast (instantaneous), but it is a zippy camera for a superzoom, is light in weight and has a good grip which makes it easier to hold. Also, it does not have a pop-up flash which I found always seemed to come up under my fingers where I was holding the left side camera. As noted above, the PANASONIC's videos were good, perhaps not as good as the SONY, but the PANASONIC was certainly capable of capturing some nice video, even in low light. The photos also were not as good as the CANON's, but they were close and very close in low light. With respect to the vibrancy of the colors, if you set the photo vibrancy on the PANASONIC to \"happy\" (which I guess is their \"vivid\") it is less of a noticeable difference. The photos look very nice and certainly are competitive in quality for this type of camera.Hopefully this comparison and these observations will help you decide between these three similar cameras so you can choose the best one for your needs. Good luck.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Serious Photographer's Pocket Camera!", "Author": "stevefoobar \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R2JKV3BBU7L7EI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried the models that directly compete with this camera from Canon, Sony, and Nikon and much to my surprise, overall, this camera was superior in almost all areas that matter most to me.  That would be the quality and flexibility of the video, the quality of the optical image stabilization, and the overall quality of the still pictures it takes.  I didn't care about the GPS as it is largely a gimmick in my opinion and all the major competitors have it now or they feel they won't be able to compete.You should realize that the GPS built into this camera (and most cameras) is NOT the same GPS you may be used to in your car or smart phone.  It does not have detailed maps, does not have a large database of places or landmarks, and is not as accurate.  It is basically for tagging your photos and videos with the latitude and longitude of where you took the image so you don't have to take notes manually to sort out what you shot and where later.  That's why I consider it largely a gimmick.Briefly then, this camera had by far, the best video quality and flexibility.  You can select AVCHD video in several quality levels including full HD at 1920 x 1080 @ 60 fps (if your computer can handle it--many can't), MP4 video in several quality settings including full HD 1920 x 1080 @ 30 fps, and even a (not too useful) 320 x 240 setting for high-speed video at 240 fps.FOR TECHIES ONLY: Note that most of these video settings output progressive video but one of them outputs interlaced (can't remember which AVCHD setting).  This makes me suspicious that the internal video circuitry may be interlaced and not progressive and they simply convert (deinterlace) the video when they create the progressive video file on the memory card.  I could not find confirmation on this anywhere and calling Panasonic support is utterly useless for something this technical--they just aren't trained to know such things.  I must say though that I didn't notice any interlaced artifacts or sharpness/quality issues with the video so I'm satisfied with the video either way.The optical image stabilization is absolutely amazing and was so far superior to the Nikon for example, that I had to keep checking that I actually had the image stabilization in the Nikon turned on!  You can literally hand-hold the camera at full 20x zoom (being very deliberate and careful) and shoot acceptable video, which is almost unheard of in a small camera like this.The still images are very high quality and have relatively low noise for a camera that has this many pixels in the sensor.  Most consumers don't realize that it's mostly the marketing departments that want to keep pushing the number of pixels in these small cameras.  The engineers know that when you put this many pixels on a small sensor, you get more noise artifacts and you can do only so much about that.  This camera is no different in that regard than all the others that are 14 or higher megapixels, regardless of what they claim in their marketing hype.And the final selling point over some of the competitors for me was that this camera, even with all its consumer \"presets\" to make this a \"point-and-shoot\" camera (actually almost too many--confusing!) still has FULL MANUAL CONTROLS and aperture or shutter priority settings for \"real\" photographers.Note that like most other pocket cameras, this one does not support RAW files but that's not what it is intended for.  Furthermore, with single images files as large as almost 13 MB in size from the 14.1 megapixel sensor, you have more than enough pixels to do some serious Photoshop work even without having RAW files to work with.This will now be my \"take everywhere\" camera when I don't need to do \"serious\" photography and don't want to lug around my full sized Canon DSLR and lenses.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Major improvement from previous model", "Author": "Dubi", "ReviewID": "R7YYUNOS1ZTPN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the original ZS-3 which served me well until it broke down. I purchased the ZS-10 and was disappointed with the low-light performance to the extent of returning it. The ZS-20 is a major improvement over the ZS-10.I have taken only 100-200 pictures but the low light performance is much better and comparable (or slightly better) to the ZS-3. I don't have hands on experience with the other supercompacts but the panasonic worked well for my needsPro's-The Zoom is phenomenal (but comparable to other super compact out there)- AF speed is very good.- Low light performance is ok (major improvement but still just ok)- Flash works surprisingly well to improve overall picture quality- Small, easy to carry around- Same battery as previous model, so if upgrading, you can re-use old peripheralsCon's- Menus could be better, 2-3 clicks to get somewhere, too many buttons and dials *** see update below- Touch screen is confusing - unclear when it's used vs. the navigation buttons *** See update below- Preliminary but I feel that the OS can do a better job. Might be because of the extended zoomOverallGreat compact superzoom, small, light and produce great pictures. Does well what its intended to do.UPDATE: April 9- Learning curve for touch screen is faster than I originally felt- Video looks great at good light, low light performance for video is not great compared to my panasonic camcoder- HDR works great with minor caveat - do not shoot moving objects as the processing gets confused and the blended picture includes multiple fragments of the moving object (in my case kids). I believe this is an issue on all HDR's - general recommendation, always take an extra pic on no HDR since a garbled HDR picture is useless- Macro works great- I played with custom setting on the dial which mitigates the multiple switches and dials this to some extend. For example, relatively easy managed to setup custom scene for HDR so to switch from HDR to iA is just a turn of dialStill very positive on the camera, great buy. Easily fits into my pocketUPDATE: April 22- Zooming on video adds a slight humm noise to the soundtrack- Touch screen is great! - I love the fact that you can just touch the specific object you want to focus on and have the camera focus on it and immediately take a picture. No more half way press, turn and then full press to \"tell\" the camera where to focus", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "I wanted so badly to love this camera", "Author": "Sierratango", "ReviewID": "R1YD5VNGW1WFEI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Where do I start?  The features on this camera are amazing.  The burst shooting modes, the 1080p video, the 20x zoom, the manual controls, scene modes, handling, and menus, are stunning and as close to perfect as you can get - at any price point for a camera that easily fits into a pocket.  This camera seemed a bargain for the features.So why two stars?  Poor picture quality.  I have a camera with $400-camera features and $125-camera photo quality.  Maybe I got a bad copy, but I'm reading other reviews saying the same thing so either production isn't consistent or perhaps some people are less discerning regarding photo quality.  Several professional reviews (CNET, digitalcamerainfo, and others) have stated that though this model is vastly improved over the previous top of the line Panasonic compact offering it is still sub-par.  The guy from CNET said that \"Depending on what your plans are for its photos, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS20's shots are either very good to excellent or unusable\".  I have to agree.  If you never plan on going bigger than 4x6 or maybe 5x7s you'll probably be fine.  Comparing the photos from my five-year old Kodak Easyshare C875 showed only marginal improvements in some pictures, but most were about the same - some were worse and the colors seemed washed out and duller than reality.  The softness and noise of the photos is noticeable upon close inspection even at regular viewing sizes.  Oh, and yes, I did the half-press to allow the camera to focus - so that's not the problem.Using the \"Intelligent Auto\" feature was frustrating at best.  Images rarely turned out nicely and I constantly found myself going into the manual modes to try to make the camera take a better picture.  As a father my primary purpose for this camera was taking photos of the kids.  When they're doing something cute or funny I don't want to mess around with settings.  I want to turn the camera on and capture the moment.  With this camera many moments were lost.  Also, I had many images blurred from movement while using the intelligent auto mode and I would think a truly intelligent auto should adjust shutter speed for detected motion.  The camera seemed to do okay when shooting subjects without a lot of detail and that were not moving.Then there are the burst pictures.  The concept is great, but usually people using this feature would be using them in action-type shots.  Unfortunately the intelligent auto feature doesn't know how to handle this and the pictures all turned out blurry.  All - even with the \"Motion Deblur\" on and the \"iHDR\" turned off.  Trust me I monkeyed and monkeyed with this thing to figure out what I was doing wrong.  In the end I had to conclude it was the camera.  The other problem with the burst mode is that, while the 2AF and 5AF photos were okay (though still sub-par), the 10, 40, and 60 fps shots looked like something taken with a prehistoric first-generation cell-phone camera.  Horrible and unusable for anything other than having.  Even the manual mode shots were mostly unusable at 10, 40, and 60fps.Other quibbles are the FLIMSY battery/SD door and the weird crunching sound from the lens when adjusting zoom - though they're definitely not deal-breakers.Some Amazon reviewers have loved this camera.  One said they dropped it from a five-story building and it survived.  Impressive.  Others have said they're seeing near DSLR quality photos.  Good for them.  Me?  I took well over a thousand pictures with this camera and spent hours adjusting settings to no avail.  I'm sending mine back and looking for a different model.  Though I'd like to give a different ZS20 another chance in hopes of achieving the type of success some reviewers here at Amazon are claiming, I really think these sorts of quality control issues are unacceptable in 2012.  I'm not even sure mine is an isolated incident considering the comments from professional camera reviewing websites.  A camera can have all the greatest features but if it can't deliver beautiful photos what good are the features?  I was mostly happy with the photos from my five-year old 8MP Kodak C875 so I don't think I'm being too picky.  I expected better quality than my C875 - what I got I'm not sure is even up to the level of the C875.By the way, I'm seeing on camera forums that Panasonic is rushing out a firmware update to improve the ZS20 photo-quality.  It's not out yet, and it may just be a rumor, but keep on the lookout.  While it's too late for me as mine is going back, maybe it will be useful for you.UPDATE: The Panasonic Firmware update for improving night handheld shots is here: [...]", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good things come in small packages", "Author": "Martin", "ReviewID": "R2Z83SQG8LPEF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Friends who lug around heavy DSLR kits (like I used to do) turn green with envy at what this little shirtpocket wonder can accomplish.  The ZS20's zoom range from 24mm wide open to 480mm fully optical at 14 mpx has to be seen to be believed.  You can start with a broad view of a landscape and then zoom in to capture a single bird on a tree so far away that you don't even see the bird in the landscape view.  The images are sharp, well saturated, with none of the blurriness and occasional purple fringing that troubled the ZS10.  The updated lenses also seem have shortened the depth of field so that I can now get the bird in sharp focus but the background some distance away is soft and blurry.  They've also vastly improved the digital zoom so that you can now take useful pictures at the equivalent of a 1013mm zoom range, and even longer at reduced MPx.  Those digitally assisted pix may not win photo contests but they'll tell you whether that distant shorebird was an avocet or a killdeer. Carrying this camera is like having a telescope in your pocket.  But the amazing zoom is only the beginning. Equally useful are the burst modes. Lots of subjects -- from talking heads to grandkids to puppies to birds to flowers in the wind -- are in constant motion, and if you take just one shot, you're playing roulette.  The grandkid jumping over a log -- you really wanted him in midair, not on the landing.  In burst mode, you'll get two, or five, or 10 or even more shots during the leap, and back home on your computer you can pick the one you like best and discard the rest.  I now routinely take dozens or even hundreds of images of moving objects, and back at home at the computer I pick out the one or two keepers, and discard the rest.  The camera also has an intelligent burst mode that takes just one shot of a static object but automatically takes a burst if the object is moving.  This camera is smart!  Although it has manual adjustments for aperture and shutter speed, I hardly ever need them.  The IA (Intelligent Auto) setting handles ISO, white balance, aperture, shutter speed, and everything else instantly and with reliably excellent results in a wide range of conditions.  The ZS20 also automatically performs some operations that previously took a fair amount of effort in Photoshop, with plugins.  I was very skeptical of the hand-held night shot scene mode until I happened to be out in the evening of \"supermoon\" without a tripod.  The orange moon had partly cleared the hills when I clicked the shutter.  The camera took a burst of exposures and then internally sifted and merged them, and in a second or two gave me as clear and sharp an image as if I had used a tripod.  It made a believer of me.  Equally good is the HDR setting for high-contrast and backlit subjects.  The camera takes a burst of exposures, bracketing the aperture, and then automatically combines them to produce a single image with a well-lit foreground.  It used to take a lot of work and luck in Photoshop to achieve this.  Totally amazing is the in-camera panorama scene mode.  Without a tripod, you stand in a spot, hold down the shutter and make a complete circle in about 8 seconds (the camera shows you a progress bar).  A few seconds later you've got, in the camera ready for downloading, a perfectly merged super-wide panorama image with no, or only very faintly perceptible, visual seams.  No further processing necessary.  There are a number of other scene modes and creative preset modes, and you can save custom settings for quick access.  The video on the ZS10 was already very good, and the 20 has only improved on it, performing in full 1080p HD, with better placement for the stereo microphones.I also like the fact that the same batteries used on the previous models work in this one.  I prefer to remove the battery and charge it in a wall charger (supplied with the older models), and I can still do that, but the 20 comes with a cable that lets the battery be charged in the camera from a wall plug or a USB port.The one annoyance with this little gem is the touch-screen controls on the digital display.  These controls let you set the focus and the zoom, and click the shutter, by touching the screen.  I can't imagine any situation where this would be useful. I unwittingly activated these controls by touching the screen and as I handled the camera I unknowingly took dozens of shots of my hand, the inside of my pocket, the ground, the side of my pants, and like that.  You can't turn this obnoxious \"feature\" off!  I've learned not to touch the screen when handling the camera, so it isn't a problem any more, but it still diminishes my esteem for the otherwise admirable engineering job that Panasonic did on this camera.This camera -- actually, already its predecessor -- convinced me to dump the 50-lb DSLR outfit I had been lugging around for several years.  I don't need it.  For me, the ZS series has disrupted the DSLR market much in the same way that DSLRs disrupted the film SLR market.  Who needs all that heavy clunky expensive gear?  I can do 95% of what I did with the DSLR, and a great many things I couldn't, with this little gem that fits in my shirtpocket.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "One thing to note - plus update re photo quality", "Author": "Otto", "ReviewID": "R20DGQJS4ERRIO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this camera, and have owned its three previous models. One thing for all to note if you are familiar with this series is that the battery must now be charged in camera with a short USB cable to a Panasonic wall charger. For me, this is a disadvantage, since I have enjoyed the flexibility of the previous arrangement -- a dedicated charger into which the battery is placed outside of the camera. I found this \"old\" setup to be more convenient and easier to use when traveling, and easier to pack. Maybe this is not a problem for you, but it was an unpleasant surprise for me. As others have noted, though, the old charger works with this battery (same battery as before), so you can easily purchase a stand-alone charger.Update 4-6-12I have now taken some representative shots with the camera and have some observations. Like the previous three models, the display on this one is not ideal in bright sunlight, although it is acceptable. To my eye, the photos are really good for the category, and an improvement on the previous models. Having the extra zoom is quite nice. I have always enjoyed the Lumix menu system, which is fairly intuitive in this segment.Since many of you are interested in the low light issues, I have taken some extremely low light shots and looked at them closely after enlarging. I find them quite good, and remarkable with a small sensor. I took a shot today, in one of our classrooms with no lights on, only illumination from an outside door half panel over 50 feet away. I cannot imagine better results with a camera this size with such challenging light.I also took some photos outside with both bright sunlight and deep shadows in the shot. The photos were excellent, rendering detail in both the sunlit elements (as expected) and in the deep, dark shadows (pleasant surprise).I have not made use of the touchscreen features yet, so I cannot comment on their usefulness. I assume they will be helpful in some situations.All in all, this is an nice update to the previous models and I am sure will serve me well in my travels. It remains easily pocketable, easy to use and full of features to experiment with and explore. The compromises are few and the benefits are many.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Whole Lot of a Little Camera!", "Author": "Rolla Gravett \"Rolla Gravett\"", "ReviewID": "R2YKPA3M4WSEV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a short while now and it is time for a review.  I have several Panasonic Cameras to include the FZ100 and FZ150, the FZ35 and the ZS3.  I also have the Sony HX9V and will make a comparison with it.  The ZS20 is an outstanding camera that takes sharp detailed pictures with low noise.  I have compared it with the Sony HX9V in low light and the ZS20 is just as good in low light with pictures.  I did notice the Sony does better in low light with video.I would like to say something negative about the ZS20, and the only thing negative I can say about it is I wish the f/stop would go lower than f/3.3.  It does go from f/3.3 to f/8, which is better than the Sony which goes to f/5.9. It also does not come with a battery charger, but they are cheap on Amazon.  The batteries are cheap as well on Amazon.  The battery life does seem to be fairly long between charges.The Panasonic works great in Manual, giving full control of the f/stop, the shutter speed, and the ISO.  The Sony Manual controls basically suck.  The only mode you can control is the shutter speed in Manual.The menus are Panasonic and if you have any other Panasonic camera the menus will feel right at home. The camera has 4 Priority Modes of Aperture, Shutter, Program, and Manual.The Shutter Speed is controllable from 1/2000 to 8 seconds in Shutter Priority and 1/2000 second to 15 seconds in Manual.Burst Mode:  The camera has 6 burst modes.  2 fps (frames per second) Auto focus,  5 fps Auto focus, 10 fps, 40 fps, 60 fps, and Flash Burst.  In the 2 and 5 AF modes the camera will focus in between each shot.  In the 10 fps mode, the camera will take 10 shots in a row.  wait one second and it will take 8 more.  Wait one second and it will take 8 more.  In the 5 fps AF mode it will take 100 pictures straight without stopping!  I assume it will do it in the 2 fps mode as well but did not check that. In Flash Burst it will take 5 flash burst pictures in quick succession.The ZS20 will zoom to 20X in the 14mp picture mode.  If the camera is set to 10mp picture size and I-Zoom is turned on it will zoom to 47.3X.  This is with digital zoom turned off.I have found that picture quality is extremely good and detailed.Macro works great and there are two modes.  The mode with AF beside the Macro Symbol is good for taking a shot of something at a distance of 3 to 4 feet.  Zoom in as much as needed and the camera will focus on the object.  If it does not focus you are too close.  The mode with the Macro symbol and the magnifying glass is for close up macro work.  The camera will only zoom to 3X, but will focus up close and personal.The camera has GPS Tagging.  I tried it and it works.  My photo software picked up the tracking and showed the place taken on a map.  I tried turning on GPS tracking and left it on for 5 hours while I turned the camera off and it showed no signs of battery usage.  I would recommend if you are going to use it to turn it on way before taking a picture as it takes a while to find itself the first time.  I was able to shorten the time it takes to find itself by hooking the camera to my computer the first time to tell the camera where I was located.The LCD can be seen in bright daylight.  I set the LCD to auto adjust by going to Menu Set in any program mode, such as Aperture, Setup Menu, page 3, LCD Mode and set it for A (auto power LCD).  Press Menu Set again and it will show the A with a square and a star on it in the picture mode. To get out of the Menu Modes press the return button on the bottom of the camera below the Menu Set rocker on the right lower side of the camera.A still photo 3.5mp picture can be taken while taking video by pressing the shutter button.  A still photo can also be captured in playback video by playing the video back on the camera and pressing the button on top of Menu Set to pause the video and then press Menu Set and it will ask you if you want to \"Save this image?\".  To save it highlight YES and push Menu Set.  In AVCHD progressing HD video the camera will record for 30 minutes.  In the GPH mode of AVCHD video GPS information is also added to the video.  I don't know how the GPS information is then pulled out of the video.  In the MP4 mode of video my camera goes 27 minutes.The SCN modes on the main dial work outstanding.  I really like the HDR mode that takes three pictures at different exposure levels and combines them into one picture.  The Night Portrait works great for taking a portrait with a building or night scene behind the subject.  Night Scenery works great and holds the shutter open for up to 8 seconds.  Handheld Night Shot is outstanding with no tripod and has saved me many times at night with no tripod.  The camera takes several pictures and combines them into one shot.  I also like it if you are in the SCN mode and turn the camera off.  When the camera is turned back on, press Menu Set and SCN mode is highlighted.  No reason to turn the main dial off of SCN and then back on SCN like you have to do on my FZ150.  The best mode in SCN is Panorama.  Just set the camera to Panorama, press and hold the shutter button and swing the camera for a Panoramic Shot.  You will have to play with that mode to get the hang of it.  At first I kept going too slow and it did not take the full Panorama.  The speed of panning has to be fairly brisk.  It makes one wonder how in the heck the camera can capture a shot panning that fast but it does.I especially like Zoom Resume. The camera remembers how it was zoomed on your last shots before turning the camera off and when the camera is turned back on it zooms back to the same setting.  It has saved me many times in getting a quick shot off and not having to zoom the camera again.  To set Zoom Resume, go to any priority mode, such as A, and press Menu Set.  Go to the Setup Menu, page 4, Zoom Resume on top and press the Menu Set button and turn it on.  Another really nice thing is to turn on the grid.  The grid will help you to take a picture in the Rule of Thirds and throws a grid on the screen to help you take a properly aligned shot.  Put any of the intersecting lines on the grid on your subject and instantly your pictures will be better and more enjoyable to view.  To turn it on, go to any of the priority modes, such as A, and go to the Setup Menu, page 3, second one down to Guide Line and turn it on.  The Histogram is also nice to see what the picture will look like, exposure wise, by looking at the Histogram on the LCD before you take the shot.  To turn it on, go to the Setup Menu on page 3, and select the third one down, Histogram and turn it on.The camera will Auto Bracket at 0, -1, and +1 maximum.  You can Auto Bracket at less with 1/3 exposure stop increments.  To turn Auto Bracket on press the button above Menu Set two times in the shooting mode.  Move the brackets by pressing the button on the right of Menu Set.  You can adjust exposure for all pictures by pressing the button above Menu Set one time.Manual Mode.  The shutter is adjustable from 1/2000 to 15 seconds.  The f/stop is adjustable from f/3.3 to f/8.  I really like how it works.  After selecting Manual, push the button above the Menu Set toggle called Exposure/Map.  Then pushing the button above and below Menu Set adjusts the shutter speed and the button on the left and right of Menu Set adjusts the f/stop.  To bring up the metering dial just half press the shutter button.That concludes my review at this time.  I am really enjoying this little camera and it takes some really great pictures.  I am amazed that they were able to cram so many features into such a little camera.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic ZS20 great mega zoom point and shoot camera", "Author": "NatureGirl \"Amy K\"", "ReviewID": "R1MWOS77UZ2H71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I consider myself a serious hobbyist when it comes to photography. I've been shooting with Nikon DSLR's for several years (currently using a D300s). I shoot RAW images only and process everything in Lightroom. You can visit my website and have a look. I live in Miami, FL, so there's a lot of local stuff, but also travel galleries. I love birding and I'm often in the Everglades. [...]That being said, I always carry a P&S; camera. I have a young daughter and I like to have more than a cell phone camera handy. I also do not like lugging the heavy gear to kids events, etc. For years, it's always been a Canon P&S; for me. I had a very hard time finding just the right upgrade this time, with all the new mega zooms now entering the market. However, I didn't see anything out there that beats the Panasonic in price and features.Overall, I really like the ZS20.  It's full of features and includes an HDR setting and Pano mode (which is amazing I might add). I keep GPS turned off to save battery.  Keep in mind, this battery drains quickly if you are like me and you take pictures, videos, go in and out of the menus and are constantly reviewing your images. I purchased a couple of spare batteries and the external battery charger.  Sorry, but the USB to camera charging system sucks and the cable couldn't be any shorter! Keep with the Panasonic original batteries only and keep a few charged and on hand when shooting.Picture quality outside in good lighting is excellent. Shooting 1080p video on this camera is awesome and iMovie recognizes my clips and brings them right into the program. Indoors, I'm still struggling to get a crisp shot. I do find the images noisy, just as I have read online in other reviews. I haven't played around enough with the settings to try to do better, which I do believe I can do. I love that this camera has A, P and M mode, plus 2 custom functions. I find the placement of buttons to be comfortable and love the grip.I will keep experimenting and will update my review if I encounter something worth updating.  Keep checking my Flickr galleries, as I will continue to add test shots. The images on Flickr are straight out of the camera images (no editing). Please visit the site if you want to check out what the camera can do. Also check out the gallery of our new puppy, which were also test shots taken with this camera with no editing.

Control and button placement is good and easy to use especially for video with its own button on top.  You can take still photos while recording videos.  Telephoto works while shooting videos.  Single photo 20x and extended 40x telephoto works well and focus stays sharp. GPS tagging works well for me with Map Flickr and Flickr and will make for a nice trip display for photos taken in the same trip.  The map data downloaded to the SD chip without a problem and the maps make for a nice on-camera display of the locations the photos were taken.  GPS tagging with the actual name of the location and not just coordinates is a feature I wasn't finding in other cameras. It's easy to burn through the battery in 1 to 2 hours while trying out all the features.  I've ordered two more batteries to ensure more picture and video taking time.  I like the up to 60 picture per second bursts and the more controlled 2 to 10 fps bursts.  Reviewing and deleting photos is intuitive and easy.  The ability to touch the screen to tell the camera the focus of the photo is useful on a moving object like wildlife.  The up to 14M photos are the best I've taken with a digital camera.

For a compact camera, the ZS20 is very good. I can recommend it. For my complete review and personal observations, see:[...]My rating: 4 stars. It would be a solid 5 if the camera had an optical viewfinder and an easy manual focus option. I will not rate any camera a 5 without these.Quick and dirty Pro/Con list:In general: PRO -1. High quality photos. Excellent HD videos. Very good image quality for a compact camera.2. 20x optical zoom. Very wide 24mm to very long 480mm. \"Intelligent Zoom\" is very good.3. Good focus ability. Fast and reasonably accurate, compared to my previous pocket cameras.4. Excellent image stabilization. Best I've seen.5. Small, pocketable, carry camera. The lens closes flat inside the body when the power is off. Carry it anywhere.6. Auto, Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, and Manual shooting modes.7. Four user-settable custom shooting modes. A little awkward to set, but usable.8. Several easy to change flash modes, including the important NO flash.9. One can take a (low res) photo at the same time one is shooting video, without interrupting the video.10. In-camera Panorama ability. Does very well with \"normal\" well-lit scenes. Not so good indoors.11. In-camera High Dynamic Range photos.12. Auto bracket (only 1 stop each way.)13. \"Smart\" macro. For most shots, no putzing required. Automatically goes into macro mode, when needed.14. Can use any SD flash card, including SDXC, which can have a HUGE capacity. One will go through several batteries before one fills up one of these flash cards.15. Clear, bright view screen. Very nice. Does not replace optical viewfinder, but is generally useable indoors and out. Brightness automatically adjusts for ambient conditions.In general: CON -1. No optical viewfinder! !!!!!2. As with most cameras, whatever you do, don't drop it. Keep it dry. Buy the extended, covers-all warranty.3. No manual focus! !!!!!  There is a way to use the touch screen to focus on an area, but it is difficult to use in time to get the shot you want. The camera will almost always focus on the closest object, no matter what you want. Focus tends to \"breathe\" in and out during video. You can \"freeze\" the focus, but then it won't focus when it needs to.4. Minimum f-stop is only f8. Maximum is f3.3, but that rapidly decreases to f6.4 with zoom.  Renders aperture priority mode almost useless.5. Difficult menu system. No customizable user menu (but does have 4 user shooting modes.)6. Short battery time. No more than about 200 shots per charge. Buy and carry extra batteries!7. In-camera battery charger is all that comes in the box. One should buy an external charger.8. Camera will get very hot after several video shots. Limited video time per scene. The camera is not a replacement for a video camera. Use it for short scenes, only. HD Video quality is excellent, however.9. Touch Screen. This causes more problems than it cures. There is no way to turn it off.  You can accidently take a photo just by touching the screen.  I soon learned not to do that.10. On/Off and Shoot/View switches do not feel \"solid.\" Battery cover is a little flimsy. Be careful opening it.11. 4x digital zoom is terrible. It destroys image quality very quickly.12. Closest focus distance in most tele shots is over 6 feet.13. The user manual is typical Orient-glish, instead of English. It is very long, hard to read, and doesn't really explain things (similar to most other camera manuals.) It usually comes just short of telling you what you need to know. And because of the strange wording, it might tell you one thing and someone else something different.14. The camera might be too small. It is a little awkward to use if one has big fingers.15. Dealing with Panasonic customer support is a challenge. Be prepared to wait for answers. If you buy Panasonic's warrantee, be prepared to hassle.  I paid for it, but had to wait over a month for them to send it to me, only then because I nagged them every few days about it.

My review is for people like me: love photography, use mostly scene settings, some manual tinkering (aperture and shutter speed priority) and love to take scenery and wildlife pictures. I am in the market for a smaller camera to take to my hikes/travel etc. to replace my Lumix FZ28 which was stolen on my recent trip to Costa Rica. I already have a Nikon D5100 which I love and takes great pics, but it is just to heavy and bulky to take along. I purchased both a Canon SX260HS and a Lumix ZS19 to try out because both their specifications seem comparable and I trust both brands. I took pics side by side with these two cameras, and here are my observations:1. color: panasonic colors were generally cooler with more green/blue vs. the canon's warmer colors (yellowish tones) for the same scenes and lighting2. the HDR features of the Lumix are amazing for high contrast/bright background.3. the zoomed pictures for the Lumix were clearer (less blurry) than the Canon's (I took pictures of a power tower and some distant hills in the late afternoon light)4. the most important consideration for me was the ability to focus. I took pictures of flowers and foliage and the Lumix clearly outshone with the feature of the touch screen (I could tell it to focus on a particular petal or detail just by touching the image on the screen) whereas I ended up with a lot of out of focus pictures with the Canon.Note that I did not try the GPS feature of the Canon since it is not that important to me.In conclusion, even the expert reviews talk about a better image quality of the Canon SX260, I decided that for my purposes, I prefer the images that the Lumix ZS19.I am going to return both cameras today and order the Lumix ZS20 instead (because of the promotion, the price of the ZS20 is the same as what I paid for the ZS19, so the GPS feature is for free!!!)", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Definately 5 stars.", "Author": "Skipper", "ReviewID": "R1ISVQG5ETX4RR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can only agree with the other reviewers.

We loved that camera, but it was getting beat up from a lot of travel and the flash was not firing as brightly as it had been.  I wonder how long these flashes will last - for me it was about 3-4 years, but I am sure it depends on how many times you use it.In any case, the newer model is nice, the 20x zoom works really well, and I found the image quality to be excellent for a small compact size camera.  For serious photographers, the image quality will not compare to my mom's $1800 Canon SLR, which I borrow from time to time, but I would not expect it to.  It is small, easy to put in a pocket, and has a really long zoom for such a small size.  The image stabilization works well to help get clear pictures at full telephoto, and the scene modes do work pretty well as I have used the sunset and night photo ones a few times with some pretty impressive results.  I was also happy that it takes the same battery as the predecessor.  I purchased an extra battery for that one, so now I have three!The only con's I would say are the following:- Battery life is shorter, but I think it is because the GPS is on.  I have not tried turning it off, but I read reviews that said that the GPS will drain the battery.  For trips when I may need more shots and less GPS, I will turn it off, as GPS-tagging is not very important to me and not all of my cameras have it anyway.- I really liked the panorama assist feature of the predecessor (the one where it helped you to line up each shot to stitch later on the computer), and they took it out of this one.  I was able to take some nice pictures and enlarge them.  This camera has the panorama sweep mode, which produces a low resolution (by comparison) gimmick of a photo which is useful to document something (think of a realtor wanting to show what the inside of a house looks like), but not something that you would enlarge and hang on the wall.

I looked at old pictures that I took with my ZS6 and the pictures are sharper.  The other thing that I noticed with the ZS20 is that it doesn't have the Picture Adjustment mode where you can adjust the contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction.  I use the sharpness adjustment a lot with my ZS6 when taking pictures of flowers and scenery.  The sharpness adjustment on the ZS20 would have solved this issue and I wouldn't have to return the camera.  I got it for a very good price too, $269.  It's a shame.I wish Panasonic would put back the Picture Adjustment mode to next year's model and increase the megapixels on the still images from video to at least 5 or 7 megs.

It replaces an older 6x optical/5MP model. The older model uses AA batteries which I prefer, but can live with the new proprietary battery. The biggest concern was a reviewer who said the start-up time was a little slow on the new camera. I find it to be just as quick as the old model, and far quicker than several Kodaks owned in years past. The lens protection shutter on the new camera seems to hang up a little on closing. The same shutter on the old model would stick half way open which led to gluing it in the open position and it has worked fine that way for several years. The paper manual is small with lots of precautions about using proper battery, etc. While the charging cable has a USB connector, you have to look at the larger, 197 page, manual provided on a DVD to find that your computer can be a power source. A computer IS needed to see the manual! The ZS20 screen is larger with better resolution causing onlookers to comment about how nice images are on it. At full range the 20x creates very little problem with movement distortion but some difference in multiple shots can be seen. I live on a river 6 miles wide and boats photographed about 4 miles out appeared pretty sharp in most digitally enlarged shots. It has more bells and whistles I probably won't use, like stereo digital sound recording and GPS. GPS draws power even with the camera off, unless disabled! It's just as compact as the old camera and is light weight, but more suitable for belt-mount, than a pocket. The old model was the same. It will take larger capacity memory chips, but seems limited to battery life for any video efforts longer than about 30 mins. With just a little more engineering it looks like a smart phone could have been included...Update: May 11, 2012Still very impressed and after my son saw it and liked it, we ordered one for him as a birthday present along with extra batteries, a case and a SD card!  I like the Case Logic we got for me and him that shows as an option under the camera on Amazon. It just fits, has a separate zipped space that nicely holds a spare battery, camera fits just right, and it comes with a detachable D-ring and separate belt loop. Padding is just enough to protect if dropped onto the sidewalk I think.I'm finding it a slow learning process. Selecting features is time-consuming. I wanted to program one of the \"C\" settings so it would always allow the 42x zoom, but am not sure how to make the changes and when I finally stumbled on how to do it, they would not stay permanent. Need a \"Dummy\" book.The manual on page 75 finally shows all the icons on the screen, what they stand for and which pages discusses them.The jitter demo feature is useful to show how hard it is to hold the camera perfectly still. And at 42x it's impossible to stop the shake while hand-holding. (The anti-jitter mode is also turned off for that, I think, which raises the question of why when this is when it is most needed.)

I own several digital cameras including a couple of Olpmpus and a couple of Canon and a couple of Panasonic.  So far, of all my digital cameras, this is by far my favorite.  Why?  Because it does what I want.  I would love to have one of those really expensive SLR digital cameras with all types of lenses and gadgets and if I were younger, I would have.  However, now in my seventies, I do not want to carry around a lot of heavy camera equipment.  I want a camera that can stay in my purse and be ready when I want it....I want to be able to  zoom in on something in the distance and this one does allow me to do that.  No, I cannot zoom in on something a mile away but this does give me a lot of zoom for such a small camera....I also want to take detailed close up pictures of flowers. etc.,  and this does just that.  For example, I recently took a close up of a rose and when I downloaded it to my computer, there was a spider on one petal of the rose that happened to be the same color as the petal.  I did not see that spider when I took the picture but it was clear and detailed....My favorite pictures are of my great granddaughter who never sits still for very long which really does not matter because this camera will handle her actions....I also like to take pictures through my windows of the birds, deer, turkeys and so on that pass by in my yard.  There is a special setting that works well for that....I take a lot of pictures in cemeteries to add to memorials in findagrave and of all my digital cameras, this one works best.  One reason is that sometimes my pictures will be in partial sun and partial shade.  My previous cameras did not handle that scenerio like this camera does. My other cameras will take well in the shade but the sunny part would be washed out or the sunny part would be good but did not get good details in the shade.  I very seldom have to do any tweaking of the pictures I take with this camera as they are are usually clear and sharp and ready to print....I have not explored everything about this camera as yet but for everyday use, convenience of size and use, I am more than thrilled with what I can do.  Oh, and did I mention how great the video turns out.  We have a small waterfall in our yard and I took some videos of it.  WOW.  The videos are great and the sound clear.

This is my 4th Lumix point-and-shoot in 7 years, and I still like it very much.  It's not perfect, and still has typical difficulty with low light, but it is improved over the earlier models.  I love the optical zoom, and the ai is excellent.  My FZ-150, a prosumer model bought just before I \"retired\", can't match it, good as the 150 was.  Typical battery limitations, yet it still can go well over 100 shots before needing to change batteries (I ALWAYS have a spare) in daylight, and often over 50 when using flash (battery-eater!).  I like the screen, and the controls were easy to adjust to.  The menu is fairly logical, and my learning curve was short.  The larger pic files allow me to use Adobe CS6, Lightroom 4, or Photoshop Elements 10 with more ease and control.  I dropped it, doesn't seem to phase it.  Used it in hot dry and cold wet, and other than the expected occasional temporary fogging of the screen (on the outside!), it performed very well.  I like the 64 Mb Extreme Pro, but can't imagine taking a full 8000+ pictures on it before downloading at some point.  Still, the SDXC is faster, reduces the lag between shots, and the quick boot up all help me capture those fleeting shots I can't set up for.  The GPS is nice, though I rarely use it.  The video I took in medium light at my son's home actually came out quite well (granddaughters dancing) with good color.  Daylight pix are just short of spectacular.  Some motion blur with race cars (ok sometimes as a special effect) or fast panning, but normally well within normal limits.  Anti-shake works most of the time, and helps my old hands.  It's not a huge step up from my former ZS7, so for me the value was marginal.  Still, I like it (liked the 7 too), and am glad I got it.  This one usually recharges via a USB port rather than a separate \"charger\"), and that can be helpful when I have my laptop handy, but also has a small adapter for AC.

Maybe I got a bum lens or CCD, but the pictures just were not that good.  There was no crispness, and the colors seemed washed out and even unnatural.  I tried many different settings (fully manual, intelligent auto, shutter priority, aperture priority, color settings). None of them resulted in what I would describe as a good quality picture.  I'm comparing it with a 5 year old entry level 10 MP DSLR (Pentax k200), and an even older 6 MP point and shoot (Nikon Coolpix P4).  In my opinion both of those older cameras produced better quality pictures than this state-of-the-art megazoom camera.  Maybe it's unfair to expect this to perform as well as even a relatively cheap DSLR (although other reviewers here have done so), but it should have been way better than my old Coolpix P4.I have to say the zoom range on this camera was incredible.  I also liked the flexibility from full-auto to fully manual.  This would have been perfect for an SLR guy like me.  The touch screen on the back is borderline useless, but that's easy to ignore.

I think I have had it for about 5 years now and I have a lot of really good pictures from it. The screen just recently cracked in the corner and turned black, but it still works well. I bought the Sony DSC-HX9V because Cnet gave it such a good review, but I took it back because I didn't like the pictures. They looked too soft or more like a water color painting to me. I was waiting for a new and better camera that was pocket size, but with long zoom. I bought the ZS20 because it has everything I wanted plus some. The things that I wanted most were the long zoom, HD video, and good picture quality. It has that and more. The other things that are nice is that it has high speed video, panoramic, GPS, face recognition, and speedy auto focus. It also has a touch screen which I personally like. I like it because you don't have to use the touch screen for everything, only for a few of the controls. You can touch a person or object on the screen and it will focus and take a picture. The other thing is that if you use the zoom on the screen it will zoom all the way to 20x automatically. If you want to zoom in slow or only half way than you can use the finger zoom in front of the shutter button. You can also turn off the touch on the screen if you don't want to use it.  I actually haven't taken very many pictures with it yet, but so far it is nice. One thing I have noticed though is when you take a picture in low light the lens sticks out so far that the flash creates a shadow in the bottom left corner of the picture because the lens is in the way. That is miner to me though because I would rather have the long lens then not. I have used the video on the camera about three times now and it seems to me that sometimes the video will speed up slightly when it is played back on my computer. I am going to keep using it, but if it does it on every video I might have a defective camera. The GPS also uses the battery up fast. The battery charges in the camera now which would be nice while I am traveling, but it sucks at home because you can't use the camera and charge it at the same time. The camera has to be off to charge. The first day I got it the battery died really fast because it wasn't charged all the way so I had to let it charge up before I could start playing with it again. I definitely need to get more batteries and a wall charger. I like the GPS though. I turn it off when I am taking pictures around the house, but when I use it everywhere else I like to have the GPS on so I can see on Google Earth the exact spot I took the picture. If you download Picasa and Google Earth. It will show you right where you took the picture on a Google earth map, and I can see other pictures people have taken and shared. So far this camera is pretty nice and it is a keeper. The only thing that really sucks is that by the time I got the camera with 2 day shipping the camera was already $40 dollars cheaper.UPDATE: Has anyone else had a problem with the video speeding up for a second here and there?

They're easy to get the hang of and I've had no reliability issues. I started with a Panasonic Zs3. Later on I upgraded to a Zs7, then when I saw Amazon was selling a Zs9 which was the same as the Zs8 but with a stereo microphone and the price wasn't much over $100 (from Amazon Warehouse), I couldn't resist buying it for its 16x zoom. It's been a great camera. I love my Zs9 with it's long zoom despite it not having GPS (which I didn't care about) or HDMI out, and with a lower LCD screen resolution than the Zs7. I thought the screen clarity was fine and didn't miss the 460,000 dots on the Zs7.Well, I couldn't resist this newer upgraded Zs. The Zs20 is my 4th Panasonic Lumix Zs camera (all of them purchased from Amazon), and I can say without reservation that this is the best of them all. I love the fast burst shooting made possible by the CMOS sensor.The 16x zoom on the Zs8/9 is really great. I've taken some fantastic close-up shots with it. Now I have a 20x zoom. Amazing. It's operates when shooting video too.Canon's G series, by comparison, has a larger 1:1.7 sensor compared to the Zs20 1:2.33. But, the zoom is very limited on the Canon and the camera is too big to carry around in your pocket - and it cost twice as much (and the older unavailable G9 model is better than the later ones I hear.) Their competitor for this Panasonic is their 20x zoom model SX260SH with a similar 1:2.33 CMOS sensor. Professional reviewers are rating the Zs20 higher than the comparable Canon, which is slightly larger, heavier, and costs more. Everyone raves about Panasonic's Leica lenses, with good reason. The Zs20 is just an amazing camera for the price. It's even slightly smaller than the Zs 7,8/9/10 and easy to carry in your pocket in a thin stretch case. Like the Zs7 (which never cost less than about $250.00) it has the 460,000 dot bright LCD screen, HDMI out, and GPS. It also has more features than the Zs7 or 8/9/10.Don't expect the price to get much lower. As I recall, the Zs10 (the real predecessor of the Zs20) price came down to about the Zs20 price today, or maybe at the very end, a few dollars less, but I wouldn't wait. Panasonic may refuse to lower the price any further. It's already so heavily discounted, and there is a limit to how low they'll go. If you want the absolute best deal, get a \"used\" one from Amazon Warehouse. It's hardly, if at all \"used,\" and most likely brand new but returned for some reason and re-packaged. You have 30 days to send it back if there is anything wrong with it. You don't get the one year warranty however, so if that's important to you, but a new one. It's definitely worth the price. I already had an extra battery but you can buy a non-proprietary battery very inexpensively that lasts even longer than the battery that comes with the camera. I also had a wall charger (two - from my Zs7 and Zs9)), so I didn't have to buy that. I'd say that's the only thing Panasonic let down on. It's worth getting a wall charger, but it should come with the camera. This is the first time it doesn't.

Enough so that when I showed it to a cousin who is a photographer, he was impressed with its ability as well being such a small camera.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small Camera with Great Zoom but Poor Pic Quality, A bad Copy?", "Author": "Tony T.

She brought to work and we tried different settings(ISO, Iauto, P, S, A,...etc) and shooting conditions indoor, outdoor, macro, zoom(mid to long).  I had to agree, for some reason the ZS20 is not taking as sharp picture as my dad's ZS7 or my Panasonic LX5.  I know it's comparing to orange to an apple when it is compare to LX5 but it's hard to keep the camera when the only decent pictures we got were macro shots.  Everything else was too pixelated on my 24in monitor even the ones with ample daylight. She end up taking her Canon T2i and Olympus EPL1 with her on family trip and returned the ZS20.The camera is amazingly small(with the mega zoom lens it is even a bit smaller than my LX5, but this can also be a problem if you have a big hand....) and zoom is great if you do not care the pictures are not going to be sharp.  We don't know if we had a bad copy or not but my boss lady doesn't want to spend more shipping cost to find out~The buttons and menus on the ZS20 is very similar to other Panasonic compact camera families(at least compare to older ZS and LX5).

The TZ stands for Travel Zoom and this camera continues the great tradition of having a great compact camera for travelling.  I purchased the Panasonic Lumix TZ3 in 2007 and felt that I needed an upgrade to catch up with technology.  The TZ30 has double the zoom, panoroma mode, HD video recording, touch screen and significantly faster performance than the TZ3.  Given technology commoditization, I paid less for the TZ30 than I did for the TZ3 five years. ago.Pros:Compact size - The TZ30 is actually smaller than my old TZ3 and is comporable or smaller than many of its competition.  The camera still isn't pants-pocketable, but fit very well in cargo pockets or jacket pockets.Image Quality - Outdoor pictures are great.  Indoor pictures are actually very good, particularly when using a flash.  Several reviewers have complained about poor indoor picture quality, particularly noise at higher ISOs.  Certainly, the Lumix does not match DSLR or professional quality point and shoot cameras with large apertures, but I don't really notice an issue as a casual user.  I was taking pictures inside Las Vegas casinos and the pictures were fine.  I also created a panorama picture on the Vegas strip at night, with no issues.  Publishing on facebook or printing smaller photos (e.g., up to 8x10) won't raise any issues (in fact Facebook introduces more noise using their compression algorithms than any noise in the source picture)Zoom - 20x optical zoom rocks.  The TZ3 had a 10x zoom and I thought that was pretty useful, but the 20x allows a whole new level of capturing images.  Not only is the zoom at the telephoto end pretty good, but Panasonic has made the wide angle lense a bit wider for capturing scenery or group photosPanorama Mode - Panasonic probably stole this from Sony, but you can take a panorama picture by sweeping the camera from side to side.  The camera then stitches together a composite panoramic picture.  Note, that the lense has to be at wide angle in order to use the panorama.  Moreover, one's sweeping movements may cause some unusual distortion of the picture (where the center gets curved).Video - The camera provides 1080P video capture (full HD) and can capture in MP4 or AVCHD formats. I tend to use MP4, since it is easier to edit. Unlike my old TZ3, I can actually zoom and record.  There is some sound from the zoom lense if you change zoom and record, but not terrible.  You can also capture still pictures at 3 or 4MP while recording.Speed - The camera is quite quick.  The camera turns on quickly and shutter lag is minimal.  Auto focus is very quick and can actually track an object (great for kids or animals).Travel Features - The Travel Zoom series is targetted at travellers and the camera continues to have the appropriate features, including GPS, world travel clock, using the tele/wide toggle switch to find pictures on a calendar, etc.Cons:1. GPS - Although a great feature, I spend most of the time with it turned off in order to reduce battery drain.  I think the GPS will be nice when I'm travelling to foreign lands, but I don't think it is all that useful in daily use.2. Charging System - One has to charge the camera by plugging a USB cord into the camera.  As a result, it takes quite a while to fully charge the camera. There is an optional charger that is available, which will allow charging a battery while using your camera and much faster charging times, so plan on a few bucks to purchase the external charger. Battery usage on the camera is fine.  I took ~70 pictures with flash in Las Vegas (but GPS off) and barely dented the battery capacity.  I anticipate a couple of hundred pictures before the battery discharges.3. Record / Playback Switch - The switch easily gets moved between the two settings. Just wish it was a little more robust.  Product build otherwise is pretty god.So why purchase the Panasonic instead of competing cameras from Sony, Canon or Nikon?  When I was looking at similar cameras, I found the Panasonic to be slightly more competitively priced, while providing a more robust feature set.  Moreover, my experience with the TZ3 suggests great build quality, which allows the camera to stand up to global travel.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera with a fantastic zoom", "Author": "TJ", "ReviewID": "R1G498SW2CPL17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I am very happy with the performance of my Lumix ZS 20 Camera.Overall a great capable camera at this price range.Pros:1.

I had a ZS3 with 12X optical zoom.  I absolutely loved that camera (a friend dropped it).  I took a picture once on full zoom out of a plane window of a ship in the water below at least 2 miles away.  It was just a speck in the distance.  I then magnified the image on the camera's screen and I could see the color of the ship, how many stacks it had, etc.  It was simply amazing.  Well, I bought this thinking that the 20X zoom would be even better.  It was not, and actually it is nowhere close to the ZS3.  There is something wrong with the focus.  When you zoom on the screen the picture is fuzzy.  I took the same picture with the Z20 and an older Canon. The old Cannon looked much better. This camera may be too technically ambitious.  It has some nice features but they went way over the top and made a mess in the process.I also went to Costco and checked out the Z19 -- it seemed to be better, although I had to take a picture in the store and I didn't have a direct comparison.I read some other reviews here saying that someone else had the same problem and that Panasonic was updating the firmware.  But I called Panasonic twice and they have no firmware update planned and the reps said they know of no such problem. The firmware on the camera is version 1.0.  I told them about the reviews on Amazon and they clearly didn't want to know anything about it.I can't live with fuzzy pictures so this camera is going back to Amazon.  Buyer beware.UPDATE----I have since gone back to Costco to check out the zs-19 and looked at it more carefully.  The fuzziness was no better than the ZS-20.  So I ended up replacing my original ZS-3 with a factory refurbished unit I found online.  It will get me through until Panasonic fixes their issues.  What was also interesting was that several sources online sell the ZS-3 new for $4-500 even though it's an old model. The lens was really great on the ZS3.  The later ZS models use some lens tricks to try and get the same results using less lens -- this could be an issue.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like it, but has it's flaws.", "Author": "T Post", "ReviewID": "R2KGCUSN0DL7TL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At this time there are seveal hundred reviews so I won't re-hash the specs as others have done a nice job.

It isn't bad quality, but the same as you might find in a lower end different brand model.- You have to switch a button to toggle between taking pictures and reviewing pictures. At the surface this sounds trivial, but after a few months use I find it annoying. Each time you toggle the lens retracts and there is a few second delay. This becomes annoying if you take a picture and want to have a quick look at it before snapping another. You have to retract the lens, find the picture then expand the lens again before you can take another picture. Seems most other brands let you preview quickly while taking pictures, I am just not happy with the extra time it takes with this model.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "ZS20 and ZS15 comparison", "Author": "Ashlea Beers", "ReviewID": "R23YPHNY5TJIJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased both the ZS20 and ZS15 to compare the two cameras and decide which one I like better. Since the ZS15 was significantly less expensive than the ZS20, I decided it was worth trying both. As far as I can tell, the technical differences between the two are A) 20x optical zoom vs 15x optical zoom, B) 14.1 MP vs 12.1 MP, and C) the ZS20 has GPS but the ZS15 does not.As most casual, yet technically savvy, photographers already know, the 2 MP is not going to make a huge difference at this level for day-to-day picture taking. As for me, this camera is to take pictures of family (usually kids) and of nature/wildlife. We live in Colorado and spend a lot of time in the mountains taking pictures of the scenery and wildlife, so a good optical zoom was very important for me. I've never blown up a non-professional picture bigger than 11x14, so the megapixel difference was a wash for me. Another big requirement I have is decent picture taking in low light. It's not like I'm trying to take pictures inside, at night, with the lights off - but it would be nice to take pictures in a room with dim lighting without the flash making everything look funky or getting picture after picture with people's eyes closed.Out of the box, I started taking pictures with both the iA mode and various different \"scene\" modes. Honestly, on both cameras, I found most scenarios to have the same experience and quality. However, with taking pictures in EXTREMELY low light (with a light on behind me but no lighting in the room of the subject I was taking a picture of) were quite different between the two cameras. It seems that the less light in the room, the longer it would be for the camera to take the picture after pressing down on the button. There was a much longer delay on the ZS20 in this circumstance, and it was extremely frustrating. At first, I even thought I wasn't pressing the button down, but I was. The ZS15 still had a delay, but not quite as long as the ZS20. I tried this in both iA and multiple scene modes and had the same result. Again, this was extreme, as I was doing it in a room with almost no light - I could not even see what I was looking at through the LCD screen because it was so dark. I'm sure this can be corrected with manual settings, but I am not going to kid myself into thinking I'm going to learn the finer technical points of photography overnight. I couldn't tell any difference between the two cameras when it came to nighttime scenery with light (a dark street with streetlights) or natural daylight pictures.Sometimes I was very disappointed with the picture quality, but it was not the camera's fault. I know this because if I changed the settings, the same exact picture would look EXTREMELY different. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought the pictures were taken with two separate cameras. The reason I mention this is that I think this camera has fantastic potential. If you are willing to take the time to learn about cameras and the different settings to use in particular conditions, this will be an amazing camera. This is something I want to do, but I also wanted something that will take very good pictures out of the box using the default modes that are built in. If you are unable or unwilling to fiddle with changing to different presets and figuring out when to use those at the very least, I do not think this camera will be good for you. I am very excited to learn how to do the manual settings as I think this will take this camera to an even higher level. Again, the potential seems very high.As far as the zoom goes, the 16x vs 20x was something I was very curious about. Can I zoom in more on the 20x? Well, duh, of course I can! Enough to justify the cost difference? Eh, not so much. Optical zoom is very important to me, but 16x was more than enough to fulfill my needs. I just didn't think the extra zoom was worth it for me. The intelligent zoom is very good on both cameras to go beyond the optical zoom, which surprised me. I was able to take hand-held pictures at full zoom on both cameras without blur. Even taking pictures of a full moon on full zoom were quite impressive.The touch screen I didn't find particularly good. It's one of those that you kinda need to depress a little, which to me is not a sign of a very good or responsive touch screen. However, a touch screen on this camera that is similarly responsive as a high-end smartphone I think would cause a lot of accidental touches. So in this case, the touch screen is neither a plus nor a minus. I could go without it but it does not detract from it either.THE BOTTOM LINE:* Decent camera out of the box. It is definitely not a good choice for the older crowd or people who are not very technically inclined. If you can't program your DVR or set up a home wireless network (which to me are incredibly easy and basic things), then this is not for you. Stick with a Kodak EasyShare or a Canon PowerShot, which are more user-friendly from my experience.* Lots of potential with manual settings if you are willing to learn more than the average camera user to get the most out of your camera.* Optical zoom is fantastic for the camera size and price point.* Manual settings give this camera a significant advantage over similar cameras in this price range.Should you get the ZS20 or ZS15?I ultimately decided to keep the ZS15. I do not care about the GPS on the ZS20. For optical zoom, 16x already met my needs and I do not think the 4x extra zoom was worth the money. The 2 MP difference between the two cameras shouldn't matter for anyone that is specifically looking for this class of camera (an affordable, compact, point-and-shoot). If you really want the GPS or 4x more zoom, by all means get the more expensive camera - it just wasn't worth it for me. With the money I saved by sticking with the ZS15, I can get a new video game and a 12 pack of my favorite microbrew :)", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good...but one flaw that may be deal breaker", "Author": "SDsportsFan", "ReviewID": "R3RPSZXQDOS2P6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I haven't played around with this camera too much, however in the IA mode and taking photos indoors with moderate lighting have produced photos with the bottom left hand corner \"shadow\".

When that happens, the lens can start to expand against the inside of the case, possibly causing damage to it.  (I've already lost one camera this way.)

Just run a Google search on the camera for reviews.My motivation for buying this camera was simple - our family was taking a 2-week trip to China this past August.  I have an excellent Nikon D70, but it's heavy and bulky, especially when hauling the telephoto lens and external flash. I knew we would be on a fast-paced trip in hot, humid weather, so the last thing my family or I wanted was to be burdened by a big SLR and its accessories. Instead, I purchased this small camera and I have absolutely no regrets. In many respects, this was better than my SLR. For one, it takes HD video, which I did a lot. It also has an excellent burst mode, which was very useful when taking photos from a moving tour van since single shots would often be obscured by foreground objects. Using the burst function insured that I had several shots of the same subject from slightly different angles. It also has an abundance of pre-programmed selections, but has several manual overrides for exposure (I wish there was a way to manually focus or set it to infinity). And it fit in my pocket.One problem with the small cameras is they can be a bit hard to hold, stabilize and use due to their size. I solved that problem by bringing with me the Joby Gorrilapod Joby GP1-A1EN GorillaPod Flexible Tripod (Grey and Black). I simply left that attached and used it folded as a hand grip. This proved to be an excellent decision. And a few shots needed the stability of a tripod, so I was all set. Of course, lots of curious onlookers stared at my set up wondering what it was all about.I only have two reservations on this camera. First is the abysmal battery life. Fortunately, I took the advice of other reviewers and purchased two spare batteries and the external charger which were absolutely necessary. On a busy shooting day, I used all three batteries. Second, since there is no viewfinder, it can sometimes be difficult to find your subject and frame the shot, particularly hard to see objects when zoomed fully. Aside from that, no regrets.

I owned two of the early models of Lumix and was a big fan.  Big enough such that I only gave other brands a cursory glance when looking for another new camera.  The low-light problem has, however, been a problem with these models for a long time. It can be somewhat mitigated with the flash and exposure time, but low-light pictures can still be frustrating.While I was already a fan of the camera despite this one issue, this weekend solidified me as a customer for life.  Less than 24 hours after receiving the camera from Amazon I was on a rooftop bar in Asheville, NC taking wonderful photos of the mountains in the distance.  When the people in front of us moved from their table next to the edge, we moved over to get a better view.  A decision which next lead to me knocking the camera off the side of the balcony.  Five stories up.

I use this particular camera for travel and for taking pictures while I kayak.  For both those kinds of picture-taking, I need a small camera that fits in my shirt pocket and also one with a good long zoom to capture nature photos.  I was thrilled that the zoom on this one is 20X where my older one was a 16X.  That was a great upgrade for me. I also use a long neckstrap instead of the wrist strap that coomes with the camera and this allows me to secure the camera around my neck, then into a shirt pocket while I'm kayaking with less chance of dropping it into the water. The camera takes very good pictures even though I'm often holding it with one hand and sitting in a moving kayak.  I recently took a great picture of a bald eagle in a tree and when I came home, I put the picture on my computer and zoomed and cropped it so that it was a really excellent picture.  I can do this because I do all my picture taking at the highest resolution on the camera.

So when it came time replace these cameras I did quite a bit of research on new technology.  My choices came down to a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-WX150 and the ZS20.  I ended up buying both prior to a trip to Haiti.  I used the Panasonic and my wife used the Sony.  After a month here is what I found:  The Panasonic is a FAST camera.  Time to come on is is very fast. I found I could pull it out and capture I shot quickly, even from a moving vehicle.  Time to focus and cycle time (time to write a photo to the card and be ready for another shot)are also fast (I am using a 32 MB Class 10 45 Mbps card).  And the LCD is clear and bright.  I have had no problems seeing the screen outside in bright light.  My only caution would be to use the lanyard provided.  The camera is so small that hanging on to it while taking photos can be a challenge.  FYI - I was used to hanging on to older cameras that had bulky \"handles\" containing 3-4 AA batteries.One other thing, the touch screen was very helpful when taking photos from odd angles.  Just tap the screen to shoot.  That took a bit of getting used to as this is my first touch screen camera.  So I took my share of photos of my leg or the ground.  But once I got used to this I found the touch screen handy.  The photos this camera takes are also very good.  It focuses quickly, on faces, movement and does well in low light with no flash.  All in all, a great camera.  I found the camera also does a good job with video.  I used it to take video in a variety of conditions:  outside in bright light, from a a moving vehicle, climbing in the mountains of Haiti and at a concert.  Audio is good for a camera of this size and I found I could zoom in and out while shooting video.  That is something my \"prosumer\" Nikon DSLR can't do.  I am pleased with the video.On the Sony - it is also a fast camera.  But we found a couple of things we don't like about it.  First, there is no dedicated switch to toggle between taking a photo/video and showing folks the result.  You have to go into the menu to do this.  And downloading photos/video from the Sony to PC is maddening.  The Sony software is not intuitive and we spent considerable time trying to successfully move photos/video.

I am a casual photographer with some history in advanced amateur photography, back in the days of 35 mm film and hours spent in the darkroom.  I use photography now to assist me in remembering and savoring life's events, special moments and special people. After pondering whether I should invest in a dSLR, I decided that I wanted a more pocketable, travel-friendly camera that recorded accurately and without undue fuss.  I also wanted a substantial improvement in zoom capability. The point and shoot cameras I had been using (typically in the $150-$200 range) were too prone to yield washed out or skewed color or poor contrast, had inadequate zoom, and seemed to produce satisfying results only when lighting was nearly perfect. I decided to try this one after reading many written and video reviews. (The other cameras I considered were the Canon SX230 and the Nikon Coolpix 9100, but I did not take them home for testing.)It's absolutely amazing. The anti-shake correction is flawless.  Panorama shots are trivially easy and a great way to capture the scenery here in Hawaii. Color rendition is excellent. I was very surprised at the clear nighttime photos I was able to take, handheld and without a flash. Video quality is very good. The autofocus features work very well, and I find myself defaulting to the intelligent autofocus setting for general snapshots.  I like the touchscreen for flipping through photos, but haven't found too much need to use it to pick a focal area. That might change as I experiment further, and it's nice to have the option. The touchscreen is not excessively sensitive, so I have only taken a few photos by accident, by touching the screen unintentionally. The navigation menu is straightforward and it takes only a few seconds to switch to a different pre-programmed mode. I found the sunset, food, panorama, handheld nighttime, and high sensitivity programmed settings very useful.

The camera sent me a message: \"you seem to be taking a hand-held picture in low light with no flash.\"  The camera then took a burst of 6 shots, combined them internally, and gave me an image that I could easily manipulate in a BASIC photo program.  I'm sure it's an HDR type process.  I changed the exposure and played with some \"purpling\" to make the color more natural.  Apparently the shutter speed for each of the 6 burst shots, combined with the internal stabilization resulted in an amazing image.

This is probably one of the most impressive features of this camera, and one of the reasons I had such a hard time determining if I should return it.  Very sharp, and great audio quality (as long as it's not too windy).-I'll also say that the vibration reduction is pretty good as wellNow the bad:-Horrible in low light.  You're going to need a room lit nicely with 60W+ lamps to avoid pixels the size of round tortilla chips.-Horrible User Interface. (Maybe subjective, but I found it anything but intuitive)-Useless touch screen.  It was only responsive when it wanted to be.-The iA mode for pictures is ok, but has a tendency to overexpose and really overexposes when there's a high contrast range.-The 14MP image sensor on this camera is horrible for any zoomed pictures.  My Nikon SLR I expected to have a better senor, but when my 8 year old 7MP Sony DSC-P200 point and shoot takes sharper pictures that can be zoomed into father than this camera, that's a problem.  VERY disappointed by this.-Soft Macro Pictures - to be fair, I didn't experiment much with this before deciding to return it.-Several issues with the Pano feature (my final straw):I've done numerous Panos by taking multiple shots on my Nikon D80 and stitching them together.  While I've had to do some touch up work after the stitch, I've been extremely pleased with my results, and was looking forward to this feature of the ZS20.  On the plus side, the photos are stitched together so that everything lines up, however, you can easily tell in your pictures where the photos were stitched together.  There are faint vertical overlaps / lines / distortions, (not really sure how to explain them) that show up on your panos with this camera.  It does not matter how fast you move the camera as I took some fast, and some REALLY REALLY slowly, and they're still visible.  It's like the camera lined up the photos nicely but didn't blend the colors correctly to create a smooth even image.  The best way I can explain it is if you print a picture on a set of vertical blinds.  It'll look uniform for the most part when each blind is lined up, but you can tell where the separations of each blinds are.The finally, the panos are not 14 MP images stitched together, but some other type of low res pics stitched together.  I took a normal photo at the highest quality setting that was roughly 5MB in size.  A pano of Mt St Helens and the Valley in front of it was less than 1MB.  This was a Decent sized Pano.  Now some of you may say, hey, this a pano, why do you need higher res.  I answer:  DETAIL.  I want to be able to tell if the green thing in the foreground is a tree or a bush, not just a green mystery blob.  It almost looks as if some spots were done with a paint brush.I really honestly wanted to like this camera.  It sounded like it had a great feature set, but if you're going to use the Panorama feature, save yourself some frustration and look elsewhere.At this point, I have no idea of what I'm going to replace it with.  I'm leaning towards a higher end Canon or Sony point and shoot.  I've had very good luck with Sony cameras in the past.On a side note, for those curious, I carry a point and shoot with me for times when I can't get to my D80 fast enough and there's wildlife, or lighting that is moving fast and I don't want to miss the shot.

The other two are small dots and out of warranty, don't notice until a light colored back ground but then a pain in the back side.2.  The zoom on the latest camera just went out.  It is 4 months old and I will be sending it back in for repair.4.  All four of the cameras either have or have had an issue.The camera takes some of the best photos that I have seen for an amateur - point, click and done.  Using the Sony's or Cannons that I have had, significant percentage of photos were blurred just enough to make you mad.  Video is outstanding as well, as long as you have decent light.  It is a shame that I continue to have issues with longevity of the various parts of the camera.Another upside though, the newer cameras have a built in charger so when you plug into a USB, you charge the camera.  No longer need to pull the battery and put in a charger.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "great travel camera", "Author": "robert frost \"homedoit\"", "ReviewID": "R2POMI0VGXDN25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a semi pro photographer and like this model as it fits in pocket and would not be a tempting \"theft magnet\" while traveling.

My only beef is in the earlier model, it had more scene options to choose from.  for instance, photographing through glass, water, and special effect of slimming.  I have used it for well over two years with zero issues.  batteries hold charge a long time, and I keep a extra one in small carry bag.  I travel for my work 52 weeks a years so cameras can get bounced around so I found that a prescription pill top, (free if you ask nicely from any pharmacy) fits over lens for a perfect \"second cover\",  I even put some sturdy thread through the side of it and it attaches to my camera strap.  The lens cover that comes with camera opens and closes when turned on/off, but I have seen them damaged in most stores easily by I assume children playing with it.  This is my 5th time buying same ZS models every year or so  and so far have not seen a better lens than these Leicas!  The zoom is very good, with little distortion, another great feature, but of course not as sharp as a larger camera with a specialty zoom lens.

The first one (ZS7) I upgraded for better (720p) video. That one (ZS8) I dropped in the ocean and destroyed it (all my fault). The third one (ZS10) served me well for 2 years until finally started having some mechanical problems and stopped zooming to closing down the lens cap.Now I have the ZS20, which has a little better video and imaging technology than the ZS10. They also move the mic over away from the end where your finger ends up inadvertently covering up much of the time when shooting video. It's a great little camera which takes surprisingly good pics and vid and is really easy to use. I recommend it for casual and semi-serious photographers that don't want to get bogged down with bulky/unintuitive equipment but still care about a bigger lens and ultimately better image quality than you'll get from a phone or other non-camera devices. I also recommend it to pro's who just need something really handy to get that quick shot in with nearly the quality that there high-end stuff will get.

(We have been faithful devotees to the Lumix brand for a very long time.)  Others have done a fine job detailing the various features that set this camera apart from its competitors, so I won't rehash all that in this review.However, those making a decision to purchase should be aware that dust (getting inside the camera and settling on the lens and sensor) has been an issue in these Panasonic Lumix cameras.  It has been for many years and many models.  This results in images with spots on them which are usually more visible when fully zoomed in.  Despite this, I continue to buy the Lumix line because they have the best overall feature set available, in my opinion (besides the dust issue).Note that we take extremely good care of our cameras, always store them in their cases, constantly brush and blow off any dust particles we see on the camera's body, etc.  The problem is with the zoom lens.  Tiny dust particles are sucked into the lens when it expands open (which is any time the camera is turned on or zoomed).  Panasonic acknowledges the issue and will clean the camera for free within the warranty period (1 year).  After that, if you experience the issue, you'll either need to upgrade your camera, endure the dust, or pay to have it repaired.My previous Lumix (DMC-ZS3 I believe) was actually easy enough to open that I could clean it myself (with guidance from Youtube videos).  However, they are using tiny new star-type screws inside the camera (securing the sensor) which I can now no longer access (not having the proper tools).(On a related note, two of my brothers-in-law purchased the same camera as I did - on my recommendation - and neither has had dust appear on the lens. So, this seems to be an isolated issue. Just know that it is a possibility.)Anyway, for now, we Lumix owners must simply take great care to keep dust, sand, and dirt particles off the body of our cameras (and hope that none find their way inside our camera lens).  I guess this impending issue causes us to appreciate each dust-free day a little more, knowing that it could be our last.  :-)", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera", "Author": "Michael Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R3UIFE7G3X02AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few years ago I sold a Lumix camera that I wish I never had.

I absolutely love how fast this little guy is. I hated waiting for my other camera to cycle over and catch my next shot. With this camera I can shoot many pictures in quick succession. I took it with me on a recent sailboat cruise and the built in stabilizer worked fabulous for capturing distance zoom shots on the rocking boat. For the amount of features and quality pictures this sweet camera gives you I would have expected to pay at least double the price. I do advise purchasing a second battery for it. I did and keep my second battery charged and tucked into my camera case so I always have a back up. I also advise that you bring the camera with you to find a case.

The pixel quality may not be the best, but man is this full featured!! In camera HDR, pseudo-tilt shift, almost everything you can think off, this camera does. The zoom is amazing, and the features never seem to end. For example, baby mode - you record the birthday of up to two kids. When you switch to baby mode (1 or 2) it automatically adds the age of the child to the EXIF data!I needed a quality camera for my Urban exploration, when I am not able to carry a DSLR. Low light, manual, GPS and video were on my list. This camera has that and more. Today I had it on a decently challenging outing. One battery lasted for 500 photos, many of which used the flash. That impressed me.Low light, automatic: Without the flash, these tend to blurry - slow exposure time. Going manual corrected this.Manual mode: Limited options, but nice on a camera in this price range. The screen shows an accurate preview.Panoramic: Not great. The stitching is not perfect, they are often blurry, and very low resolution.Video: Really, really good, better than my GoPro Hero2.  It tends to lose focus in differing light conditions. The sample was shot in bright light (obviously) on a recent abandoned building exploration. The sound quality is amazing.GPS: This can be a pain. There's an online feature that assists the camera in geocoding for the first time. If you don't turn this off afterwards, the camera keeps using this setting. So my first time out a few miles from home, it was off by that distance. Turned off that setting, and GPS worked great.Mic positioning - I found that I kept covering it with my fingers when holding the camera - odd placement. Same for the flash. Had to retrain myself and nor wrap my fingers around the camera.The photos are pretty darn good, and I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality.  I've uploaded some samples.It's a good camera, probably perfect for the point and shoot user. I have it as a backup to my DSLR, and to that it does not measure up. But it's probably as close as you can get in this price range.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easiest five stars I have ever given out", "Author": "TW", "ReviewID": "R1YMREZEITBTUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far the best point & shoot I have owned. If focuses quickly and accurately no matter what the zoom is set to. Manual controls are easy to use (but auto almost always gets me a great pic anyhow). You can control ISO, aperture and shutter speed manually. You can also do burst at 10fps. It takes awesome 1080p/60fps video and focuses very quickly on the fly.The zoom on this is just plain awesome, especially for a camera this size. It opens up pictures that simply wouldn't be possibly with regular (non mega-zoom) point & shoots. After using the 20x optical zoom for a week I'll never go back to 3x/4x optical zoom ranges.Maybe pics have a bit of noise when blown up to 100%, but for regular prints and screen sizes pics look very sharp.Bottom line is that I am getting pics you'd normally need a DSLR with massive lens to get using a pocket sized camera.

DC-ZS3 produced fairly good pictures for a compact camera, but I thought I could use all the new bells and whistles that came with DC-ZS20 such as better zoom, panoramic shots etc. In June, I took DC-ZS20 on a month-long trip to Europe, where I snapped about 3.5K pictures with it. When I got back home and started looking at the pictures on a large screen, I realized about 3K of those were just awful (and I don't mean my picture-taking skills).The major problem seems to be an over-zealous noise reduction program in the camera, which is particularly bad in low light. But even the shots taken in a well-lit environment and/or with the flash were smothered too. I had many group pictures taken from 10-15 feet and in most of those one couldn't even make facial features of people in the shot.Panoramic shots were also a disappointment, because the photos would only come out with the fixed height of 864 pixels as opposed to 3K one would gets in the normal shot. In addition, the camera locks into iA mode and does not allow any adjustments to the settings. All in all, the \"upgrade\" turned out to be a major downgrade. I had a few pictures taken in the same places where I had shots taken by DC-ZS3 couple years back and the difference between the two was stunning (not in favor of DC-ZS20).To add insult to injury, the camera just quit on me two days before the end of my trip. The LCD screen would come up and show all the overlays, but the picture itself was black and so were all the shots I tried to take. I had to send it to Panasonic Service center for repairs upon return - still not sure what the problem was.The bottom line - stay with older models or look at other options", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good traveling camera", "Author": "W.

Photograph a rocky outcropping across a canyon with very good detail.* Color rendition is very good.* Shoot stills or video (HD) at will: not necessary to change modes for video.* Telephoto is available during video shoot.You can read about other features like GPS and photo effects at any of the better camera review sites: dpreview, cameralabs, etc..The main downside is image quality which can show digital artifacts, especially at telephoto.

I eventually upgraded to the ZS20 for more zoom and GPS capabilities.  Until recently, I was 100% satisfied with my camera.  One day after I had the camera for a year and a half, the shutter decided not to open.  There was no obvious event that caused this.  After 30 minutes of fiddling with it, the shutter opened fine.  Over the past six months this issue has become more frequent, and takes longer to recover.  I've read online of MANY people experiencing the same problem.  Yesterday, once more, the shutter would not open.  It's been almost 24 hours and it appears that it will not ever be opening again.

I specifically bought it to take on a Mediterranean cruise. While others were lugging around their digital SLR behemoths, the ZS20 comfortably fit it my pants pocket. I researched all type of cameras and once I settled on a compact digital, I decided to buy the newest, most feature laden compact digital I could find. I was not dissapointed in my selection of the ZS20. The picture quality is excellent and it is loaded with features. From one menu, you can pick settings for panorama, sunset, portrait, landscape, food shots and about a dozen more. However, left in its fully automatic mode, the picture quality is excellent. For the more advanced user, you can set aperture, shutter speed and a few other manual modes. It also has some neat picture modes - black & white, Sepia, one that gives you pictures a 1960's look, and one that makes your pic look like you are photographing toys. Filming video (1080 HD) is as easy as pressing one button. The 20X optical zoom is fantastic. You can double that with the digital zoom, but the 20X is unbelievable. You can shoot burst up to 10fps. There is a high speed video function that slows down fast action video (cool!).I was very impressed with the ease of learning so many of the features of this camera. It is very easy to use.

I am a pro but cannot carry a full sized DLSR around with me and its assortment of lenses when I am just going about life. And now with the weight and bulk restrictions on airlines, it minimizes that problem too. But as a professional, it has features like the panorama feature that I am using professionally as well as the HDR multiple exposure still feature that gets a better range of exposures all into one finished shot. The Leica lens is superb. Two levels of JPEG is also an excellent feature. But also as a pro I would not have bought this camera if I could not turn off all the gadgets that are installed for amateurs to do their thinking for them like the flash on camera that is about as unflattering a light for photographing people, the GPS, and a rafter of other annoying features like the date and time stamp on every photos. You can always find that information in most photo processing applications since it is recorded but hidden from view. It has video recording but the software that smooths out jerkeyness or hand held camera motion tends to result in making its own jerky transitions so I am sticking with my great little Canon video cigar tube camera for that.It even has a nice tripod screw thread on the bottom for the use of a tripod or mono-pod in low light conditions or high end \"selfies\". After reading a review of the latest lower end model, the reviewer said that for about the same price, you could still buy the last version of the high end model and I did. Good choice even if I don't like the brushed metal setting changer on the top that is very hard to read as it catches the light and makes reading the different setting difficult.

I chose the Panasonic Lumix zs-20 as I didn't need the WIFI capability of the zs -30. This camera performed very well in a difficult environment. PQ was excellent and consistently good in variable light conditions. I just left it on auto focus and the camera did the rest. There was little learning curve required with this camera . The set up directions are a breeze and after using it just 3 days prior to the trip I knew how everything important worked.  This camera is very pettite and fits in the palm of your hand. I was worried that I would not be able to handle it easily in a zodiac with thick gloves. I solved that problem by wearing a thin inner silk glove and I was able to use the camera with ease though I did need to use both hands for stability. You do have to be careful not to press the red video button when using the  zoom lever but I quickly got used to it. Picture quality and stability did deteriorate somewhat when using the zoom to the max on overcast days. But otherwise it worked just fine. My wife took a DSLR camera with very expensive lenses and yet my little Panasonic was flexible enough to capture some great shots in comparison. I did not have a problem with battery life on this camera but that may be because I turned off the GPS and did not use the blu ray resolution video options which are battery vampires.  Always a good idea to carry around a spare battery if you plan to use these options to a great extent. In reviewing my photos I found the review and delete buttons to the lower right of the view finder very useful. It was very easy to select the \"keepers\" after every day of shooting.

I don't recommend trying it twice.So I've bought about 8 cameras over the last 15 years - and each one has been a major step up in capacity and utility for the price. The price point stays the same, but MP count and features stack like crazy. So let's get started...The good -Low light - I'm significantly impressed.  Shots that would have taken flash before come out reasonably clear without it.  The Intelligent Auto mode picks up what you want to do pretty well.  The Night Mode Scene selection give you a number of options - though I could wish that the max exposure time would be a bit more than 15 seconds.  (The ZS10 model will do up to 60, but I found that the pictures were a bit muddy, and for an extra $10-20 more the ZS20 is much more capable. A year makes quite a difference!)Macro Mode -  Ridiculously close, decently sharp.  Have fun, but I don't recommend getting a good shot of your earbuds, unless you REALLY want to see what you're sticking in your ears.  Flower buds are one thing, earbuds another.  Also very good for reading fine print in contracts, SD card markings (Did you know that the speed rating is marked by a C with a number inside?  C10 is fastest, but on the micro-SC cards I use that marking looks like a little blob.) and more.  I'm pleased with the sharpness of the pictures overall.Regular shots - I'm pleased with the sharpness of the pictures again. The panorama setting is VERY nice, the high-contrast scene setting works quite well even in lower light settings.  Fiddle a bit with it, and see what you can do.Video - Lots of options.  LOTS of options.  Want to take a video at 220 frames per second?  This will do it, though at a pretty small frame size.  (QVGA)  I look forward to about two years from now where it'll be 220 fps at 14MP...Zoom shots -  The optical zoom is excellent - my favorite test (at least for this camera) is to find a small item about 40-50 feet away, then zoom in on it and see what level of detail I can get.  I'm checking a fire sprinkler head, about 4 inches in size.  It's reasonably clear, to the point where I can see the lettering on it, but not quite able to read them.  Adding in the IA zoom, and it's larger - but not quite so clear.  That's to be expected, since it's interpolating between the pixels it has to make it out to a simulated 40x.  Good enough, for a pocket camera.  (BTW, the ZS10 didn't do nearly so well.)On that matter, I've noticed that there's some 'fuzz' when I take a 14 MP image and examine it very closely.  After a while, I realized it was the result of a 14 MP image being taken down to the pixel level.  A 2 or 4MP shot will have a fairly defined delineation between two pixels on an edge, for instance.  With a 14MP shot, you'll have four or five or six pixels where there were two before so it gets a bit trickier trying to find an edge.  This might lead you to think the shot is fuzzy - and in a sense it is because you're getting a lot more info than you're used to, the camera can show you more detail.This might be a problem for some users.  It's not for me.  In a way, it's reminiscent of the graininess of photographic film - the lower the speed, the finer the grain.  I'll have to fiddle a bit with it to see whether the 100 speed or 3200 speed settings have more grain in a particular situation.Now... the bad.I like manuals for cameras, since they'll detail out what the various settings are and how to use them.  The basic user's manual with this doesn't cut it beyond very basic functions.  Fortunately, an Advanced User's Manual is available from Panasonic, [...] - which details what each setting does.  And at a cost of 'FREE' for the download, it's a very worthwhile addition.  I'd have liked a more comprehensive manual in paper - but at least I can find it on the internet.Included graphics editing software - it's slow.  But it works.  But it's slow - and not terribly simple.  Wizards will attempt to do everything for you - where I'd prefer to get by without them.  Maybe it'll grow on me, or maybe I'll just get a copy of Photoshop Elements or use GIMP.  Time will tell.The 3D function...  Yay for being able to take photos in 3D!  Boo for needing a 3D enabled TV to display them on.  I don't know I'll use this particular function - but it's interesting that it's there.Battery life...  I don't like internal charging. I really prefer an external - but there's a good number of external options.  Just check the \"Customers also bought this\" section, you'll spot them.  I purchased one from TheMemeStore, the charger works fine and the batteries are fully compatible.  So that's a solution.  I think it'd be better to keep the external charger - but that's just me.Firmware updates - the current firmware version shipping is 1.0 - but Panasonic's got a version 1.1 which upgrades the low-light capabilities of the camera.  And at the cost of 'Free', I'd advise getting it.  It's not a tough install.To sum up - this is a very capable camera, at an affordable price.  The controls are easy to use, the various settings not quite so much but you can puzzle them out after a fashion.  You might not find the pictures to your liking - but I think they're as sharp as any film camera's ever come up with and then some.  It's not a flawless camera - but it's pretty darn good and (with any luck) it'll last me a year w/no problems...", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA!!!", "Author": "Judy", "ReviewID": "R2LHGXWJ4XT6AY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have five point and shoot cameras and this is by far my favorite camera.

Excellent, excellent camera! When I bought it, the red model cost more than the silver or black, but I'm glad I picked the red because it's unique and eye catching.I had used Casio, Olympus, Canon, and Nikon in the past, and the Panasonic Lumix ZS20 beat them all in picture quality (the most important factor in my opinion for a camera), ease of use, battery life, number of useful features, etc. I enjoyed the durability of Olympus (mine was the 790 SW model, so it was able to withstand drops, water immersion, etc.) but the picture quality left a lot to be desired. Casio had good picture quality (though not as good as this Panasonic model) but battery life was not good. Canon and Nikon are overpriced in my opinion for the picture quality and features that they offered.FYI I did my research thoroughly (reading reviews from sites like CNET, talking to friends who are students of photography, and even reading individuals' reviews here on Amazon for each model from each brand) comparing the best models from Panasonic, Olympus, Casio, Canon, Nikon and Sony before I decided on this one. The only gap I saw with this model may have to do with the warranty where you may not get service if it breaks down overseas (honestly, I'm not sure about this point ... potential buyers should re-check) but that's easily remedied by purchasing a Square Trade warranty here from Amazon (which I did for my Panasonic Lumix ZS20 :)Spend the money on this cam and get the warranty ... perfect combo.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Steve Loves Amazon", "ReviewID": "R2E9HUNZRWY2RS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera technology has come a long way, and I love these Panasonic cameras.

I've tested and used quite a few travel zooms and I believe this one is the best. Others might produce marginally better image quality, but what sets the ZS20 apart is it's ability to focus fast and accurately, and a pretty incredible image stabilization system. If you've got decent light, you can take handheld shots at full zoom that are pretty close to tack sharp. I've had other travel zooms where you have to set on 2 second delay on full zoom just so the shutter-shake doesn't blur the images. And that's at 20x, which is amazing. Plus, Panasonic's Intelligent zoom does a reasonably good job of enhancing the quality of digital zoom (it does for photos what an upconverter does for DVDs). At full enhanced zoom (40x with digital), you can see what somebody looks like behind home plate from the center field bleachers at most ballparks. This camera may not measure up to the Sony HX9V for pure image quality, but it's darn close, and I think you'd only tell the difference on closer technical analysis than 99 percent of us would ever do. More important, the ZS20 is much skinnier, easier to use (subjective), much much faster, and has lightning quick and accurate focussing as well as the exceptional image stabilization that I believe will result in more usable shots for casual users.

The pictures turned out better than I expected them to. In fact I kind of like the grainy look of them. The Lumix stands far above other cameras in it's price range for a very simple reason. Manual control. In low light situations where there are spotlights on what you want to focus on, most camera meters over expose, and whats worse, use a slow shutter speed. This makes your images look like a cell phone camera. I assume that the people that gave the Lumix bad reviews relied on the automatic controls. At 1600 ISO and a sturdy chair to rest my elbow I am able to get the same exposures and focus as an SLR, but I have to trick it buy telling it to underexpose the shot. Little does it know it will expose correctly. One small quibble I have is that it doesn't have manual auto focus. This annoys me to no end. Cameras are stupid.

Low lighting ok but way better than our old camera.  I will use the dslr for those kind of pics so it's not an issue.Video - very good quality with a/f continual focus.  Great if you have grandchildren or pets on the move.  What I love about this is I can record a video and take still shots while recording.  I can't do that with my dslr because it stops recording if I try to snap a photo.Program and ia mode is ideal for hubby since the rest is Greek to him.  Not sure which setting is best for him, yet.

She likes it a lot.  This camera is 12 mp not 14 mp.  Both descriptions are used in the data that is presented with the camera and is probably the reason for Amazon suspending sales. It's dumb anyway.  Megapixel number is a myth, myth, myth.  This camera  is, and should be, rated at 12 mp.  The camera is reasonably sharp and focuses accurately; and of course the zoom ratio is outstanding. There is built-in sharpening and noise correction which is too bad.  The good news is that both of these can be turned off by menu so that the user can use separate photo utilities to sharpen and correct for noise as they wish.  These specific camera controls can ruin any photo larger than 3x5.  Noise in this camera, even uncorrected, is acceptable at the lowest iso although it rapidly becomes objectionable with even modest iso increases.  Low noise larger sensor (eg DSLR) cameras and superzoom cameras are mutually exclusive.  Superzoom lens acrobatics are only possible because of the tiny size of their respective sensors. As technology advances, these smaller sensors will improve.  Years ago, professional photographers would sneer at 35 mm cameras but now most pros use them or more likely their digital equivalents.

From my point of view the Lumix ZS20 has many major plus features.  The 20X optical zoom is phenominal, particularly with the image stabilization at full zoom.  There's not a hint of camera shake.  The GPS image tag is very useful when you can't recall exactly where the pic was taken.  You should be aware that battery life is shortened when the GPS function is turned on.  The camera is capable of taking full 1080P movies with stereo sound.  I recently put this to the test while on a storm watching trip to the west coast of Canada.  The movies taken of the huge waves crashing against shoreline rocks were nothing less than spectacular and the sound was equally impressive.  One of the things I like the best with this camera is the ability to take hi res still pictures in widescreen format.  We're all used to seeing movies is widescreen, so why not still pictures as well.  Looking at your still shots in widescreen is very impressive indeed.  The camera's ability to take stills in 3D is also excellent...much better than I would have thought.  This feature is very nice to have if you have a 3D TV.  And you can also view your 3D shots in normal 2D if you don't yet have a 3D TV.  The camera has a mini HDMI port which can be used to connect it to one of the HDMI ports on your TV or AV receiver to allow you to view your pictures and movies on the big screen.  I have a Panasonic large screen 3D TV and as soon as I connected the camera to it, the camera and TV recognized each other and set things up for viewing pictures.  And this also allows you to control the TV AND camera using the TV's remote control...how cool is that!After all is said and done, I would say that the Lumix ZS20 is one of the best bangs for the bucks currently on the market and I would have given it a 6 star rating if I could.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love Lumix", "Author": "Nicole O'Keefe \"Story Collector\"", "ReviewID": "RWSOWKXZKK09B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Lumix product.

We just got back from Mexico and I got beautiful pictures.  It takes long videos which is amazing. The battery life is very long.  Panoramic pics and videos naturally use more battery life.  I did buy an extra battery because I do not ever like having a dead battery in my camera. I thought I would need it in Mexico with all of our sight seeing but I never did need to use it. I bought this camera because a friend has an older model of this camera and I saw some of the pics from their vacation and really liked what I saw.  She took a pic of the kids on a water ride at a water park and it was perfect.  No wait for the picture to take once you push the button with this camera.

When it is not convenient to bring along my big DSLR + a bag of lenses, I would then take my Canon G1X which offers great image quality and a very useful swivel screen although not operationally quick and not quite pocketable. And when being pocketable is essential, I use my Canon S90. However, none of the above offered the 20x zoom and built-in GPS flexibility in such a light and pocketable package as the ZS20.The Panasonic's iA mode works great for quick point and shoot, the GPS locks fairly quickly (way way faster than my Olympus TG-810), the full HD 60p movie recording mode in stereo is really simple to use with a button press, the easy mega zoom helped capture quickly squirrels and birds up in the trees plus events from behind barriers, and the lens stabilizer did its job (important given the long zoom and narrow lens aperture). I also really enjoyed using the panorama scene mode, appreciate its 24mm wide angle lens, and compact form for all the features it contained. I should also add that it's quite robust - I accidentally dropped it almost 3ft onto a concrete floor and other than a tiny dent at a corner and a mark on the LCD screen near the dent, all was well and I was sure thankful.Naturally, the image quality cannot compare with DSLRs, my G1X and even my S90 due to the smaller sensor size. That is as expected and not a disappointment. The jpegs look a little bit better than from my TG-810 in that the noise reduction application seem less heavy.This camera is meant for everyday, carry everywhere, inconspicuous, fun use, and I see it filling that role well.

I'd open up photos from that old camera in Adobe Photoshop and compare them with the photos taken with this Panasonic (which has 14 mega pixels) and the Panasonic's were very pixelated and grainy.

Scott", "ReviewID": "R3UXB8ZGWW18DD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been taking pictures and owning cameras since the early 1970's, and even did professional work for a few years long ago.  I have owned a number of Nikon film cameras and a D80 digital camera with the big 17 to 200 Nikon zoom lens.  I had a darkroom for a number of years as well.As the digital camera age came upon us, I first purchased a small Canon, then a bigger Canon, and then the Nikon D80 rig.  The D80 is able to shoot several pictures with one push of the shutter and takes excellent pictures.  The problem with this camera is that it is difficult to take along with you all the time.I started looking for a small pocket sized camera in 2009.  I always said \"When they make a Camera that is 28 to 280, with about 10 Megapixels, has a big screen, and has good Macro, I am going to buy it.  I studied what was available back then and after checking out several at local camera stores, I purchased a Panasonic TZ5 in 2009.  It had all the features (9 MegaPixels instead of 10) and for 3 years, I carried it with me in my pocket or laptop bag, and shot many excellent pictures the world over with it.I had heard that the Pansonics have build problems.  Sure enough, the power switch quit working on the TZ5 in mid 2012, after three years of shooting.  I called Panasonic and the said it would cost $190 to repair this camera.  Wow!  I guess Panasonic is committed to us moving our cameras out every three years of so.  The choice between fixing my TZ5 for $190 or buying  the new ZS20 for $210 was a no brainer.The ZS20 is a great improvement over the already excellent TZ5.  It has more megapixels, shoots better movies, has rapid shutter releases, so that you can shoot 10 frames on one push of the shutter.  It is also smaller than the TZ5.  There are many options on the ZS20, so many that it takes awhile to get familiar with them.  You can easily point and shoot right out of the box and with the truly excellent telephoto capability, your long range pictures will be wonderful.  Also the built in macro is excellent as well.  But with so many options, it takes a while to become competent with this camera.  The supplied manual is truly minimal; I guess Panasonic favors the learn by trying the buttons approach, which I do not prefer.I have two items I do not like about this camera.  First, it only came with an In-Camera charger.  Second, when you are recording, the in-camera mike is not that good, and there is no way to attach an external mike.All in all, the ZS20 is a terrific camera for the size and price.  The 25mm wide angle and the 24X optical zoom provide such an impressive range for such a small camera.  The 14 megapixels is also amazing for a camera this  size.  For those looking for a gigantic improvement over a smart phone camera or a terrific pocket or laptop bag camera that you can take anyware,  the ZS20 is hard to beat.

I would go for months without having to charge the battery. This is clearly not the case with the ZS20. The GPS feature alone has an impact on battery life; however, you can turn off the GPS feature when not needed.

The iA makes it a very reliable point and shoot and the different manual settings give you even some space for getting caritative. Actually I learned using manual focus, shutter speed, and  aperture on this Camara and have to buy a SLR now to have more room to play with! So be warnt,- the dz20 is that good, that you maybe get forced to make the next step upwards.Another thing I have to mention the GPS. We are traveling a lot and we really love to later have see with google maps where the shot was taken.Cons: Well, it is hard to find some but here is on: The Camara needs a long time to start up when you are in view mode and turn the zs20 on (at least when you use a large SD card).  Switch to photo mode before turning the Camara on if you need to make a shot fast.We have a lot of fun with the zs20.

I can say this is the best point and shoot camera I have ever used. I bought a 32GB card for it, and never ran out of space. Even on full days. I also bought 2 extra batteries with it, which are not needed very often. The battery last most of the day just taking pictures, and shooting full HD video, it will last for close to an hour. The video quality is awesome, with very good sound quality. You can ever capture pictures while shooting video. There are so many 'Scene' settings on it that there is one for just about anything. It even does a pretty decent job of taking dark of night photos. They can sometimes come out blurry, but not if you hold fairly still. I also found the zoom feature was not only great for taking far away pictures, but it works as binoculars too in some cases. I haven't had a chance to use manual focus for very close objects yet, but even using auto focus on close objects comes out very good.I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a quality product that is small enough to carry around with you all day, but has many of the features as a bigger much more expensive camera.

It's been a great camera so far - took it to numerous vacations, kayaking, diving and so on and it made wonderful pictures. The screen stopped working a few weeks ago, so instead of fixing it I decided to upgrade to the new Panasonic Lumix ZS20. I was so satisfied with the the TZ5 that I had high hopes for the new Lumix. I bought it mainly because of the 20x zoom, because I thought that the pictures will be as good as my old TZ5 at least. Not at all. I took hundreds of pictures in bright daylight, perfect conditions and all the pictures turned out with so much noise! I am an experienced photographer ( I also have a Digital SLR Canon 40D) so it was definitely not something that I was doing wrong. I tried all the settings, even updated to the new firmware, but I still get the same noisy pictures. The noise is visible even looking at the picture on a small 14'' screen. Cropping, of course, is impossible. I'm giving 2 stars only because the camera has many features ( like GPS - which I don't really use, manual settings for aperture and shutter and nice touchscreen that works fine). It is also smaller and lighter than the TZ5 I was used to. Other than that it is not worth buying. Big disappointment from Panasonic. I am planning to give it to a friend, who has been taking pictures with her phone so far, so that it will be a big improvement for her.

The first two days I tried, Panasonic's servers apparently were down.  On the third day it was successful.  Before the assist update, it couldn't get a fix while inside my house.  Afterwards, it could but keep in mind the assist data is only good for a month.  So, be prepared to do it on a regular basis.  Note the manual warns that the servers may be shut down some day in the future.  So, count on it taking a few minutes to get the first fix unless you've updated the assist data.As I mentioned previously, the GPS doesn't update it's coordinates in real time.  It looks like it tries about every four minutes at best, but often a lot longer.  Even then, it may not be successful.  You can force an update but be prepared to wait 30 seconds or so before taking your photo.  I'm sure the limited updating is to save battery power but it would be nice if Panasonic gave us a setting so we could tell it how often to update.Hey Panasonic, if it's a power issue then just don't have it update until somebody takes a photo.  Then update and tag.  Don't use coordinates that are an hour out of date!  I'd rather have no tags than ones that are incredibly wrong and misleading!I am also very suspicious that it doesn't quite understand daylight savings time.  This morning, it updated the coordinates.  I drove fifteen minutes.  When I looked at the status, it said it hadn't updated for an hour and 15 minutes!  I saw it do the same thing yesterday.  It updated at 1:00 but a short time later it said it hadn't updated since noon.Yes, you can view maps on the screen.  North America will take up 2GB of your SD card.  No, you can't just upload a state or two.  Don't count on using the maps like a car GPS unit.  It doesn't update your location in real time.  Maybe a few minutes later.  Maybe a few hours later.  Also, it shows little street detail until you zoom in quite a ways.  Unless Panasonic gives us an update, I'll probably just delete the map data.  It's pretty useless.So, if you're interested in this camera for the GPS, look elsewhere.  It's not at all like the GPS in your car or the one you take hiking.As for the touch screen.  I'll say it's at least as worthless as the GPS.  It seems to ignore touches when it shouldn't, but will notice touches that are unintended.  Trying to shot one-handed?  There's a good chance you'll touch the screen and send it into some mode where the shutter won't fire.  If I could turn off the touch screen, I definitely would.The screen looks nice in shade or low light.  In sun, though, it's nearly unusable.  There's no optical viewfinder, so you have to rely on the screen.No external charger?  What?!  That's just silly and cheap of Panasonic.  At least you can shop around Amazon and find one cheap (along with much cheaper batteries that work just fine).  You shouldn't have to buy it separate, but you can.The ability to pan while shooting a panorama is cool, but has limitations and aggravations.  You won't be shooting at high resolution!  Also, you'll probably have to try multiple times before you get the shot.  Even then, you'll probably find it cut off the end.  A full 360 degree panorama?  It can be done, but don't count on it happening on the first attempt.  Practice spinning in a circle in eight seconds.  Too fast and it'll give up.  Too slow and you won't make it back to the beginning.  Personally, I wish it had the older type mode where you splice images together on your computer.  With that old mode, you get much higher resolution.  Think you can do that with this camera?  If you're in auto-exposure mode, they'll all have different aperture and shutter settings.  Plus, you won't get on-screen overlays to see where to start the next shot.And what the heck is that little rubber flap on the bottom on the battery cover?  The manual gives no explanation.  Opening it up just gives a tiny view of the end of the battery.  Is that it's sole purpose?  Just to be able to see if there's a battery in the camera?  Most people will probably never even take the battery out anyway since you have to charge it inside the camera (unless you buy a bootleg charger).Overall, I'm pretty disappointed.  The giant zoom is very nice and the only reason I'm keeping the camera.  Panasonic could improve some of the problems with an update, but companies seem to abandon their products pretty quickly these days.  If they make a non-GPS and/or non-touchscreen version, definitely go that route.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok Camera, but WARNING: Custom USB Cable", "Author": "D.

It uses a custom USB cable to charge and exchange data (i.e. You can't readily buy a replacement just anywhere.)2. The camera MUST be charged from an electrical outlet - not a PC USB port.3. The included USB cable is only about 12 inches long.So, if you have travel with this camera, you will need to buy the longer cable in order to avoid leaving the camera on the floor of your hotel room (unless you're lucky and get a room with a desk outlet). The longer cable is only about $5 + shipping. Not a huge deal, right? But if, like me, you didn't realize it was custom until 2 days before your trip, you are stuck paying for overnight shipping.The manual, which I read online before I purchased, does NOT mention the fact that the cable is custom. So I assumed I could replace it with one of my existing 6' cables.I contacted the Panasonic service team who, knowing that I was leaving for Europe in two days, would not pay for overnight shipping of the longer cable.So 4 stars for the good camera, but minus 2 stars for the idiotic decisions to use a custom USB cable and then include only a 12\" cable in the box.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just as I expected, and as others reviewed it.", "Author": "Andrew Griffin", "ReviewID": "R35M8BQR1A1IWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera (ZS-20) to replace a Canon I bought new in 2006.  I was hoping to be able to take pictures like I see others do on FB using Instagram.  Some of those pictures look great.  I'm not sure how they do it.  I don't have complaints about this camera, but it doesn't seem to have that Instagram magic, at least in my hands.  I've only had it a week so far, and I'm still getting used to Panasonic's layout after owning a Canon for so long.  It isn't difficult, just a little different, with more options available on screen now.So far,..-- I love the panorama shots.  I'm happy with this camera just because I can not only take these types of photos, but they are easy to do.-- Battery life seems decent.  I bought an extra battery, and together, I haven't had a problem even though I've been constantly playing with settings, zoom, and even leaving the camera on with GPS enabled, because...-- ..the GPS tends to take some time to update itself, with the setting I have on, where the GPS is disabled after I turn the camera off.  Thus it needs to find itself again once you turn it on, which while traveling could be who knows where.  Consequently, just today, I ended up leaving the camera on after updating the GPS info (in lieu of just changing the GPS setting to be enabled even while the camera is off--that is backward on my part, I suppose).--I can see the typical description of Lumix point & shoot cameras giving grainy, but sharper (once blown right up) shots versus the too soft shots that Canon cameras give (again once blown up).  But if you want more, don't buy a little point and shoot.  Just check out the many reviews, like those at dcresource to see what I mean.  It is all RELATIVE.  I'm just saying I think I can see what they are saying, since it has been said.--Touch screen works well, but still prefer the buttons to take pictures, because I can do it with one hand (which this camera does have BTW).--Macro seems to work well, and really I haven't even bothered to select it in a few instances where I previously would have done so.--Just realized how well the zoom and I suppose it must be the image stabilisation, because this camera has much more zoom power than my previous camera, but it is much easier to use (minimal to no shake).  I'd put this in the category of things you don't immediately realize and appreciate.--The video seems to work well, as my little niece can verify. I like that there is a separate button for it; so, it can be selected at will at anytime instead of turning a dial to movie mode like on my old Canon.In addition, I haven't made an opportunity to try it at night yet.  Inside, the flash is plenty bright, but I want to try outside.  I'm really hoping this camera impresses me with what it can do with low light levels.  I'm also curious to see how the 3D pics turn out.  I've been taking a few with the thought that maybe one day I'll know someone who has a TV I can view them on.  Even if that someone is me!Finally, there are some Custom settings, but so far I think these are only for manual settings.  I hope, but don't think, I can set up Scene type shots to be my custom setting.  Right now, to shoot a panorama, I have to set the dial to Scene, and select Panorama if it isn't already.  But if I want a different type of Scene shot, like the special one for taking pictures through glass, I have to change my setting in the Scene menu.  I'd like to just have one of the Custom settings on the physical dial be set to panorama since I have been using it so often.

This fumbling between no classes and glasses becomes distracting and frustrating (in a SLR, the viewfinder focuses at infinity).

The camera is only two months old, so I can't comment on the how well it will hold up, but is does take amazingly sharp pictures (better than scanned 35mm slides and negatives).

I discovered that the GPS function while accurate after taking a several minutes to lock on to your location kills/drains your battery very very quickly. I mean I have two batteries for the camera and they will be dead in less than two hours between taking pictures and the GPS. The couple we traveled with had a camera with GPS and would last a whole day if not more on one battery, which was not much bigger than the one inside of this zs20.

However, on a recent trip I the zoom/wide button started sticking on me and would keep zooming after I release it.  Then dropped it on a cement floor, don't drop your camera on a cement floor!  It hit with a thud and never booted up again.  So with another trip to Yosemite coming I looked for a replacement.  This Lumix ZS20 was it.  I wanted a camera that was small for traveling and trail running, also needed GPS, and a good Zoom with HD movie recording.  This camera meets those criteria perfectly.  The movies from this camera are really crisp and clear, zoom more amazing than my Zs10, nice wide shots too.  I like being able to touch the screen to select what I want to focus on in the picture.  Manual controls are nice.  The biggest improvement from the zs10 was the low light shots.  I tested 3 cameras in very low light and the ZS20 out performed them all!  Another great feature is the backlight shot.  It out performed a Nikon SLR in this area as my back lit people against Half Dome came out perfect as if not back lit at all!So love the camera, small easy to carry and the zoom is amazing to get close to wildlife and the touch to focus feature enables you to get the wildlife in focus!  Macro is great on this camera as well and for size and quick change ability you can't beat it.  That SLR missed many shoots I was able to quickly get.Why only 4 stars for such a great camera?  It is the speed of start up.  I am getting an even faster card to see if that helps.

In recent years we began to grow weary of our super  zoom camera because of it's size.  We were looking for something that we could slip in our pocket, but were not willing to give up  the super zoom.  This Panasonic camera more than filled the bill.  It takes wonderful pictures, has image stabilization, takes HD video, and can fit in our pocket easily.  In addition it will take 3D and panoramic still photos.  It has a wide range of features which can be adjusted to give the quality of color you prefer.  We set it on Happy mode and got rich color photos all over Europe.The only negatives for this camera, and what kept me from giving it a five are the battery and the lack of a view finder.  I don't believe you will find any smaller cameras with view finders anymore, but it is a great feature that has gone by the wayside. My only complaint on the battery is that Panasonic has changed the software so that third party batteries will not work, and you must by the Panasonic brand.  They claim it is for quality control of the lithium ion batteries.  Perhaps, but I would take my chances with third party producers when their products are half the cost.One other negative is the huge drain that the GPS feature puts on the battery.  It is a wonderful feature but I would not use it as it ran the battery down far too fast, even when in airplane mode.I believe the longer I have this camera the better pictures it will take.

I decided to find a camera with in-camera photo stitching.  As far as I know, there are only two brands with it - Panasonic, Sony.  I was also increasingly geotagging my photos manually. I thought it would be nice for a camera to do it for me like the one of my smartphone.  I also wanted to have high optical zoom.  With all these requirements, there are not many choices among pocket size cameras. I picked Lumix ZS20 eventually.  Jeff Keller's comprehensive review on dpreview helped a lot.I have taken over 1000 photos indoors and outdoors, on beaches, in mountains.  I am sure now that I made a right decision to choose this camera.The panorama function (i.e. in-camera photo stitching for panorama) works well.  It may fail occasionally for understandable reasons which include moving objects, drastic variation of brightness from one part to another part of the panoramic scene.The GPS works well too.  It takes a few minutes for it to acquire satellite signals. This is probably normal.  However, I think that smartphones seem to be quicker in positioning, so there may be room for GPS function improvement.  Because of this, I had to keep GPS on all the time hence draining the battery.The Optical Image Stabilizer works very well.  I get clear images even with high zoom.I love the sunset mode.  I used it for a sunrise.  It was my first time to get decent sunrise pictures with a P&S; camera.The battery ran out after about 210 photos in 6 hours on a bike trip.  I certainly need a backup battery or portable battery charger because I tend to have long trips.The touchscreen is not very responsive.  Since most touch actions can be replaced with button clicking, so it is not a big deal. I rarely use it.I am amazed by what one can get from a compact camera like this nowadays.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "BLU", "ReviewID": "R1HMBI8WU2WB3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried 4 Cameras with 16 power to 26 power lens, but none of thier stabilizers would give me clear pictures without a tripod.

That's how I got the Panasonic ZS3, with which I've been quite happy all these time, however I've always missed the manual controls. That is the reason because I decided to upgrade recently to the ZS20. I have now used the camera for two months for different events and I'm ready to give some comments:PHOTO QUALITY: I was in general happy with the ZS3 in outdoor shooting, however I had two usual issues in low light and indoors situations. Both have been addressed in the ZS20 and have been improved. The first one was the high levels of noise in high ISO in the ZS3 (e.g. when you shoot at night or indoors with flash); in the ZS20 the noise levels have been noticeably reduced (although it might still be found some in very high ISO, like 1000 or 1600, but the outcome is not so terrible as in the ZS3). The second one was the flash, which was not very powerful in the ZS3. Initially the ZS20 seems to have the same issue when you use the automatic settings, however, this can be \"tweaked\" by using the manual shutter (setting it at a value of 1/13 will make scene and background to look more natural with flash, while avoiding subjects to be blurry). The manual controls come also very handy for other indoors situations that the ZS3 didn't handle properly (e.g. getting a decent photo of a stained glass window in a cathedral was a hard task, if not impossible, with the automatic settings of the ZS3. Problem solved with the manual controls in the ZS20).VIDEO QUALITY: great in general. As in the ZS3, the optical zoom can be used while filming (three years ago this was the feature that made me move away from Canon). In the ZS20 model, the video is true 60fps, which makes panning movements incredibly smooth (officially the ZS3 was also 60fps, but actually it was just double 30fps, and this could be noticed in fast panning). Video image is amazingly crisp, and colors look great. The stabilizer looks also better than in the ZS3; I got less shaky filming with the ZS20. The only minor issue that I found is filming in low light. The ZS20 does not do as nice in low light as the ZS3 and recordings look a bit darker (that's why I don't give five stars to this model). This low light issue however, can be solved a little bit by setting the camera for a low light mode in the \"Image setting\" (e.g. \"night shot\") and later raising the level controls in the video editing software.In sum, a great camera that has manual features and a long zoom, as in bigger and more expensive models, but that is more affordable and easy to carry around.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Price", "Author": "Maksym", "ReviewID": "R2BCJXX0A7HN45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The lenses comes from Leica (German made cameras) that cost more then 3 times as much as this Panasonic!

The ZS7 flew off the car roof at 75mph; amazingly it worked when we retrieved it, but a new camera was in order.  The ZS20 was chosen because of great experience  with its predecessors. It is easy and intuitive to use.  This model extends the zoom to 20x, but this is a silly number. Unless you are on a tripod or similar platform, the human hand cannot hold it steady enough.  Picture quality is excellent and it is a definite step up from the ZS7.  I notice that the ability to focus on multiple targets is enhanced significantly.  Burst mode is fun, but not serious.  Intelligent auto is good for novices and the uninterested, but not nearly robust enough for regular use.  Low light performance is marginal, but this is a criticism of nearly all cameras I evaluated.  I do not care for the soft focus of the Canons.  I do not like the noise of the low end Nikons.  Fuji seems to have gone downhill lately, and their cameras are just not up to parr.  The Olympus was interesting, but it felt like a toy, so I gave it no serious consideration.  Hence the ZS20.  I am very happy with overall performance, which I note to be an obvious improvement over the other versions mentioned.  Complaints about battery life do not seem justified, and I think the battery life is good. Not outstanding, but good.  One EXCELLENT FEATURE I NEVER SEE MENTIONED IS THE ABILTY TO PRINT A DATE RIGHT ON THE PICTURE.  Serious photographers might cringe, but so what?  We have 40,000 pictures of the kids and family over the last 20 years.  During that time some cameras imprinted the date, and this has been tremendously helpful.  \"Was that the fourth birthday or the fifth?\"  \"Which time were we at Disney? \"  This is a seemingly unimportant feature, but one I was very pleasantly surprised to see.

They asked if I bought the camera through Amazon.com, which I did. I was instructed to get th order number from Amazon, inform them, and they would mail me the correct DVD. I did that. I sent them the order number.Panasonic then replied asking if the camera was a ZS20 or a ZS19. I hold told them initially that it was a ZS20, but I try to stay cool and contact them again with this information. I was assured that the correct DVD would be sent to me.Almost a week passed and there was no news. I contacted Panasonic again. Again, I had to tell them what the problem was, what kind of camera it was. They asked me to send them a copy of the sales receipt. I did. More time passed. No DVD.I called a final time and again I was asked to describe the problem, tell them what kind of camera it was, and what the order number was with Amazon.I finally gave up. I'll have to learn to operate the camera without the user's manual and I'll have to live without the DVD application. I still can't figure out a way to transfer the photos to my P.C.

It takes great, sharp photos indoor and out.  The only reason I purchased a new camera was for a longer zoom.  I took a long time deciding which camera with a 20X zoom to purchase as they all had their share of good and bad reviews.  So I crossed my fingers and bought the Panasonic.  Wrong choice.I have it for over a month and have been trying out the different features.  It is difficult to familiarize myself with the camera when they DO NOT give you a paper user's manual but you have to download one and scan through it on your computer.  Such a pain in the neck.  I have used cameras all my life but I am, like most people, not an electronic genius and need to reference instructions on a regular basis and lack of a paper manual is unacceptable to me.From all the photos I have taken, indoors and out, I am finding that either I get a very good shot or a bad, out-of-focus one.  The outdoor shots are much better than the ones indoors, especially of people.  Portraits tend to be washed out and some out of focus.  Also, I cannot get really close (macro) shots (tried on flowers in the park) without them being blurry.  I tried with and without the zoom.  Sometimes, the macro mode self engages and shows the symbol on the screen and sometimes it doesn't.  I also tried the manual mode to get a blurry background on people shots and no matter what settings I tried, that doesn't seem to work.The worst, to me, is that I cannot figure out what is right and wrong with this camera.  You can do the exact same thing over and over and get different results each time.  I got one flower closeup which came out sharp with a blurred background but don't know how that happened.  Tried again every which way and couldn't duplicate the result.  Took indoor people photos.  Two were in focus and one was not.  All were kind of washed out, though.Overall, I am not happy with this camera and feel like I wasted my money.  I will continue to play around with the settings and see if my experience improves but I will not count on this camera for important photo-taking occasions.  I'll stick with my older, reliable Sony for those.  In fact, I wish I had bought a new Sony instead as there was one I considered.

Operator has told me that all the problems are  to a system upgrade.

I ask for a return authorization.  He says they'll have it picked up for repair. I say 'unacceptable'.  He says he will transfer me to 2nd level support.

I replied \"Please call me; I was too frustrated by my experience to try to call you guys.\"FURTHER UPDATE.  2 days later, no reply.  I have a return authorisation from Amazon.  Camera has behaved and not locked up again.  Not sure what I am going to do.UPDATE.  Got the replacement; no problems.  Like the camera very much but no desire to change the rating.FURTHER.  Bought a new laptop and have found that PhotoFunStudio - the utility Panasonic provides to transfer pictures from the camera to a PC does not work unless you have the font size set, in Windows, to 100%.  The laptop has a great high res screen and I have it set to 150% font size in order to get things readable. Panasonic support recommends that whenever I want to transfer photos I change to 100%, which means I  must then log off [closing all programs on your desktop] and log back in.  This is dark ages programming - pure laziness and stupidity on Panasonic's part. I then need to reverse the process when I am done with PhotoFUstudio.

OMG, this is the worst experience i have ever encounter from a retailer. They don't update you if the item was shipped. They don't update their web site for tracking info. When you call customer service, you are on hold for at least 1/2 hr before someone comes on the phone. When you finally get a live person, they tend to lie about the shipping information. The young Lady on the phone said it was shipped and you should get the tracking info in via email. I said you told me the same thing yesterday and i received nothing. Then she said it was shipped yesterday and they should have sent you the tracking info via your email. I said can i have it while we are on the phone, my email is not working right now. She said you should get the tracking info by the end of today. This is for all of you wonderful consumers at Amazon, \"Do not sacrifice an extra $25-$50 less just to go to another retailer.

On the one side, there is the software and Panasonic Support and on the other side there is the actual camera itself.  First, let me deal with the software, Firmware updates, and Panasonic Support.  Here are my thoughts on that front:  1.  The included software for the camera does NOT work on Windows 8.  It is NOT supported on Windows 8 and there is apparently no intention of supporting Windows 8.  Here is a direct quote from Panasonic support once I finally managed to find a way to contact them:There is no PhotoFunStudio 1.8 update program for Windows 8 compatibility. We are sorry for any inconvenience.Thank you for contacting Panasonic.This is the software that you are supposed to use to connect your camera to your computer, control advanced functions, work with your pictures, etc.  So, forget any value on that front.  The software also appears to have issues loading on Windows 7 64 bit OS.  2.  If you go to the Panasonic Website and try to download updates, you will find a very interesting mess.  First, there is an endless loop that if you select the correct camera for support takes you directly to the sales site for you to purchase the camera.  Click on \"support\" and you go right back to the sales site.  In order to get anywhere, you need to select the wrong camera (anything other than this black ZS20).  Depending upon which one you select, you will see that there is a firmware update to correct issues with the GPS.  However, do not try to click on the explanation on what the update is for or how to install it as it will take you right back to the sales site so you can purchase the camera!If you click directly on the download, it might take you to the download for the firmware or it might give you a \"location not found\".  3.  If you finally find your way to e-mail support, it does allow you sort of fill in the blanks with whatever your issue might be.  Once submitted, I received a response in a very short order.  I was asked to provide the exact verbiage of the error message, so I sent in a screen shot of the message.  Forget that!  You get an error response from Panasonic stating that your message exceeds their allowed e-mail size!!!!Once I typed in the exact message detail, I received a response from their technical support person who said to go ahead and load the software even though the warning message states that the OS is NOT compatible and that even if you do manage to load it, it will not function correctly.  They told me to load it anyway and then contact them with whatever problems that causes!!!!When I wrote back and stated that I was not happy with this, the tech pointed out that this camera came onto the market in 2012 before Windows 8 .  Well, Windows 8 also launched in 2012 and that is a lousy excuse!  Why are you still selling the camera then if you will not support it?Ok, enough with this section, let's get on to the actual Camera review:  Here is what I liked:  1.  The camera is very light weight and they added a rubber section to the camera grip that makes it easier to hold.  2.  The 20X optics is very nice and it appears to work well.  3.  The move into the digital expansion that takes the camera to 40X is very smooth and the camera stabilization works well.  Pictures taken of an object in the rain that was 6 feet away came out very clear and the rain drop that I was focusing on was very detailed.Here are some items that I did not like as much:  1.  Many of the features are not intuitively obvious and will take some time to learn.  As an example, try to locate the function to format the card!  2.  Touch features seem a little erratic.  3.  The time to first shot appears to be much longer than the information on the website indicates it should be.As long as this camera does not malfunction and you do not want any software, it should be a reasonable camera.  I do not, however, have a lot of faith that if something goes wrong it would be repaired.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "GR8 LITTLE FULL-FEATURED CAMERA, I'VE BOUGHT 2 OF THEM.", "Author": "D.

First let me start by saying that I'm one of the pickiest person when it comes to buying a camera. Over the years I had few favorites and when they broke down I dreaded the process of looking for another great camera. I hate reading GREAT REVIEWS, buying the product, taking it for a ride in different environment only to discover that the camera works great in some instances but not in others (i.e. sometimes a camera it's great in day light but lacks during night scenes, or it's great when you use the zoom a little bit but not so great when you zoom all the way out, or it's fast in day light and slower at night, etc., etc.). I bought and returned so many cameras I lost count. After my everyday point-and-shoot camera broke down few months ago I thought I'll never find a great camera, but I did, actually I found 3 and one is a WINNER! I bought many cameras, my recent purchases were: this camera ( Panasonic dmc-zs20),PANASONIC DMX-ZS25, and PANASONIC DMC-ZS19. I have to say that all 3 cameras are outstanding,and I had a hard time deciding which one to keep. I was so set to keep ZS25 for many reasons: although it's similar to zs19 the thing I love about ZS25 were the on/off button (it's push and not slide)& the review button (it's push and not slide, which is annoying on zs19/zs20). If you don't care for those two items than all 3 cameras seem to be the same. The major difference between the them is:1. zs20 has a GPS while the zs19 doesn't (which I don't care for anyway, since it just kills the battery)2. zs19 has a semi-touch screen and zs20 doesn't ( this is a pretty handy addition when reviewing pictures in a hurry, unfortunately you can't delete pictures with a touch which would've been great). The touch screen can be used when you want to take pictures by just touching the screen and focusing on certain things.3. during recording with zs19 you can take 12 pictures, while with zs20 you can take only 1! AND THIS WAS THE DEAL BREAKER FOR ME WHEN IT CAME TO THE ZS20 AND THE MAIN REASON WHY I HAD TO PICK THE ZS19 AS A WINNER. EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN STOP AND SAVE A STILL PICTURE FROM A VIDEO, IT'S STILL NICE TO HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOSE EXACTLY WHEN YOU WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE DURING RECORDING! I love everything about both cameras, the quality it's the same, the LCD it's a bit more colorful on the zs20 (only when viewing, the pictures LOOK nicer on the zs20 but the quality it's exactly the same when viewed on a computer), the pictures are great in any situation even at night and in low light ( which it's the problem with most cameras). WHAT IMPRESSED ME THE MOST ON BOTH OF THESE CAMERAS IS HOW FAST THEY ARE (IN LOW LIGHT TOO) AND A HUGE PLUS FOR BOTH IS THE BUST MODE WITH FLASH (ON ALL SETTINGS EXCEPT FOR iAUTO) WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE A SERIES OF RAPID FIRE PICTURES WITH FLASH FULLY WORKING! Like I said I tried many cameras ( different models, brands, prices, etc.) and all the cameras that I tried that have a BURST mode option don't have BURST WITH FLASH (which in good light is not a problem but when you do need a flash...and most of the times indoors you need a flash...the pictures taken with BURST MODE WITHOUT A FLASH WILL LOOK LIKE CRAP). I was really impressed with both cameras so far but few days ago I went on a field trip with my son and the zs19 won me over (I'm sure zs20 would've been the same). The pictures I took with the zoom fully extended were UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERYDAY :) SO FAR I TOOK PICTURES INSIDE, OUTSIDE, RAIN, SNOW, COLD, SUNNY, BIRTHDAYS WHERE KIDS MOVE CONSTANTLY, SOCCER GAME WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF ACTION, ETC. AND I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. ONE THING I NOTICED THAT THIS CAMERA DOESN'T HAVE AND I WISH IT DID IS A SNOW/BEACH SETTING WHICH I FOUND VERY HANDY ON MY OTHER CAMERAS. ONE MORE THING IT'S GREAT ON THOSE TWO CAMERAS IT'S THE PANORAMA SETTING,ON SOME CAMERAS YOU HAVE TO TAKE ONE PICTURE AND FOR THE NEXT ONE YOU'LL HAVE TO ALIGN THE PREVIOUS PICTURE ON THE SCREEN IN ORDER TO MATCH THE NEXT ONE, ON THE PANASONIC ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KEEP THE SHUTTER PRESS AND MOVE YOUR BODY 360 degrees,it's super cool even my kids were very impressed :) So, overall both cameras are outstanding but for me the fact that I have the choice to take more than one picture while recording made me decide to keep the zs19. If the zs20 would've had this option I would've loved to keep it because I liked the two buttons better (on/off and review) and the LCD was a bit more vivid. One more plus with the zs19 was the touch screen. I think it all depends on what you're top requirements are. I hope I helped someone by writeing this review.

I took comparative shots of the same subject with my old Fuji FinePix 3800 whose highest resolution is 3.2 mega pixels and alternated them with the Lumix shots in the photo file on my PC so that I could \"toggle\" between pictures for comparison.  To my amazement the Fuji pictures were noticeably sharper (this Fuji model uses an xD picture card, in the Lumix I use an SDHC class 10 memory card).  I did this with every pixel option on both cameras and for each one, the Fuji pictures were better.  I thought perhaps that the problem was in the SD memory card reader so I took photos using the camera's built-in memory for transfer to my PC directly from the camera's memory -- no change, so it's not the card reader. I took the shots in the \"Intellgent Auto\" mode and the \"Program AE\" mode (two of its many options) and selected settings to ensure the highest quality photo.  Nothing that I did produced photos that were at least as good if not better (my expectation) than the Fuji.

The panels give and creak. The lens housing feels very delicate. The operation of this camera, with the touch screen active, is a bit on the fussy side. It lacks the more intuitive layout of Canon or the more useful setup of Nikon, speaking generally. So far I've only been able to test the camera on a limited basis since the battery was not charged enough for testing out of the box (not a complaint). However, the few pictures that I did manage to take did not seem of any better quality overall than my 6 year old Canon Elph SD750. Also when compared to my other point N shoot, a PowerShot ELPH 100 HS, the image quality was notably lacking on the Lumix. I'll have to wait to make any really informed comparisons because the Lumix is now charging.At this point I'm willing to say that the Lumix has an impressive array of bells and whistles. It does also have a decent array of scene choices and photo capture settings. Time will tell whether the cheap feel of the body and buttons are actually a point of concern or just something to get used to. However, at this price point everything should feel tight and of quality on the unit. I will continue to test and familiarize myself with the Lumix to find out whether it is a matter of a slightly higher user learning curve required to take good photos with the Lumix or whether the photos from this camera will always come out a little grainy / soft and slightly off colorwise.*****Update*****I have tested the Lumix ZS20 now for almost two months and I find that my former observation that the overall feel of the camera being on the cheap side remains intact. However, in fairness, while the buttons still rattle and the panels do flex, there has been no worsening of the situation. So I guess it is a matter of getting used to the flimsy feel with the understanding that it won't worsen, at least so far.As for the grainy / noisey look of the images, that still remains an issue. Outside daylight shots are very impressive at any focal length, but once you begin to zoom into the final image product on your computer you see that enlargements are going to be grainy/soft or fuzzy. The lack of definition when enlarged is very disappointing. Images taken in dark or night at any resolution or focal length are plagued with noise / grain. This remains a problem and I don't foresee a resolution. You will also note a distinct lack of difintion if you take a photo of a woven fabric or grass, for example. The camera has a tendency to render these textures flat or fuzzy when set to \"iA mode\". You can work around this a bit with the manual mode, but the results aren't too much better. It's a shame.One other very disappointing problem that may not matter to many, is a washout effect while trying to take photos against a bright sky backdrop. When you try to take a photo of a bird in flight or an airplane, the camera sensor seems to get overwhelmed by the brightness of the sky and you get a white image.  If the subject is at an angle or the sky isn't too bright you may get the shot, but it still will be somewhat \"whited out\". This problem occurs using the \"iA mode\" and the \"Program mode\". If you tweak and play with the settings on manual you can work around the problem a little, but that is assuming you have time to do that while you are trying to photograph something in flight!Overall, this camera works well as a simple point N shoot under non-demanding situations. It is at its best when taking photos with good, evenly distributed, daylight and in controlled compositions.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good little camera (not excellent), a few key quirks", "Author": "kharris2828", "ReviewID": "R288WJIXHEUL0F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Took it to a New Year's celebration, as I got it for Christmas for myself.Pros:- Fairly easy to use- Compact- Seems to take good pixCons:- Long lag between pix, which I thought I'd read it DIDN'T have - was one of my key criterium- Burned through batteries after about 20 pix, so our final New Years pic had to be taken with someone's iPhone :(UPDATE: Charged the battery overnight - when it arrived the battery was not charged.

If it was dreary, and in London & Hamburg it certainly was, the pictures were grainy, soft, and any movement completely ruined the photo.  I still kick myself for not taking a better camera.  A lot of really great moments were lost.Enter in the Lumix ZS20.  Portability is a must and low-light performance is a must.  Those are my 2 things.  This camera certainly does better in low-light, much better than a phone.  The zoom is fantastic.  The touch-to-focus is really nice & fast.  I really had no complaints about it.  But if I'm going to carry around a dedicated camera, it sure better be a step-up from my phone, right?  I recently got the Galaxy S3 and pitted it against my old iPhone 4S.  It was roughly the same, picture quality wise.  When the Lumix ZS20 arrived, I took it out after a few days and compared it against my wonderful new point & shoot.  How did it do?  The pictures were beautiful!  Much more saturated than the pictures coming out of my smartphone.  The colors really popped.  However, and especially at 100% crop, I realized they were really no better than the Galaxy camera.  I was kind of flummoxed.  Have phones really come that far?  If I turned up the saturation/color on the phone, the pictures would be nearly identical.I was lost.  After *a lot* more research, I decided to step it up to something a little less pocketable, but something that would offer better quality pictures.  I went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 12 MP Micro 4/3 Compact System Camera with 3-Inch Touchscreen LCD and 14-42mm Zoom Lens (Black), of the mirrorless variety.  I just got back from a weekend in NYC and snapped over 500 pictures with the GF3.  It looks like it's here to stay.  Beautiful pictures that have really great detail.  Easily a few steps above the ZS20 and my myriad of smart phones.I have no major complaints with the ZS20, but look out point & shoots, with the quality cameras coming in smart phones now, I think your time on this Earth might be coming to a close.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice compact that delivers great pictures", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R8CG90EXI59CF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take on some hiking trips through our Natioanl Parks.Great weight and size for on the trail.Takes great pictures.The only draw backs are:1.

BUT! There are two flagrant design flaws.1) Look at the photo of the camera. The lens barrel is placed essentially flush with the side of the camera, which makes it nearly impossible to get any grip with one's finger on the front of the camera, something necessary both to hold it steady and to prevent it slipping and falling. My previous Lumix wasn't built this way.2) The battery charger. It consists of an AC adapter that MUST be connected to the camera via a USB cable. And not just any USB cable, according to Panasonic, but only the one provided. This has multiple disadvantages. First, it becomes impossible to use the camera while it is charging (switch one battery for another). Second, the cable is short, so you either have to be lucky and have a table or something near an outlet on which to lie the camera or you have to put it on the floor and hope nobody steps on it. Third, woe! to you if you lose the cable or even forget to take it with you wherever you go.Who dreamed up this idiocy? The previous Lumix had a small AC adapter that was self-contained with a compartment for the battery being charged. It also had prongs that neatly folded away when not in use.

The Kodak Z760 has been a companion and friend and still works beautifully, but the technology is just outdated, so I decided to upgrade and grab a smaller camera with more features.The Lumix ZS20 seemed to have everything one could dream of... on paper! It had a GPS; it charges the batter while inside the camera with a versatile USB/wall outlet charger; it had several customizable options for \"scene\" modes (such as snow, low-light, pets, etc); and much more. The camera could imprint the name and DOB of my 2 pets, it could recognize faces of children and add their age and pic date.... The camera promised to create digital pics with a super 20x zoom in a compact body. And the camera looks very sharp, the flash doesn't pop-up (which is a huge pain when you are trying to hold it down), the screen is a sharp LCD, the buttons and casing feel very solid, with a  rubberized grip on the right and solid/cool buttons all around (despite the semi-annoying \"click\" sound the buttons make whenever they are touched due to being brushed metal). In any case, the camera looks good, feels solid, and had almost dream-features on paper for a compact camera.But as it turned out, almost every photograph was either too dark (indoors) or extremely blurry. :( I will update several pics here so you can see what I mean. I am NOT a \"rookie photographer\", but someone who has used complex digital cameras (compacts and pro-types) for years and has played and customized pics very well.The Lumix ZS20 has just been a disaster for me. Now, it could very well be that it was damage din transit, since the shipper person at Amz decided to ship it in a cardboard envelope with ZERO PADDING and it was damaged in transit through UPS' rigorous beatings... I mean movements. So I may be blaming the camera ehere for no reason, but I have to state that the pics came out terribly. Even using a tripod, the pictures had some blur to them.Most of my pictures, regardless of whether I was using an \"Auto focus\" mode or on \"scene mode\" where I manually select the type of scene, simply produced blurry pictures, many with so much noise that they are un-usable. The \"soft skin\" mode actually produced some nice \"paintings\" of my wife, who is Caucasian with medium skin and light-colored eyes. Pics of me, being \u00bd Italian looked ok, a bit \"Eastern European\" \"grayish skin tone\", considering I am Caucasian as well with bright eyes, so the skin tones were totally off.So overall, the Lumix ZS20 has produced a barrage of terrible indoor pictures. The outdoor, sunny/bright pictures were ok, but backlight pictures (sun in front of camera) were terrible, with an orange tone. Outdoor pics of the sun behind camera did not trigger flash, which is a huge nuisance, as my target was in partially in shadow. The only time a picture will come out \"perfect\" outdoors with this camera if when the sun is right above... so I am limited to taking pictures between 11am and 1pm!Now, why did I give the camera 2 stars instead of 1? I only did that because 1) it could be that the camera was damaged in transit due to abysmally BAD packaging and because 2) the camera itself is well-built and attractive. I gave 2 starts as someone may read this and want to give this camera a try, and hopefully a good employee will package your camera in a box with padding and you will get a perfect camera that will last for years to come and produce great pics and memories, as most quality Panasonic products have before.I guess I will never know if this camera is any good....
