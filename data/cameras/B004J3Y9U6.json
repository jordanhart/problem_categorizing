{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great little DSLR worth your consideration.", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R161SUZUDT3WP1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated 2/24/14.Even though this camera was released back in early 2011, it still is a wonderful and simple camera to use which delivers excellent image quality under any shooting conditions.The camera has a glossy plastic finish which doesn't exactly exude quality or make it feel like a high-end camera. But construction on this camera is very tight. The plastic is light-weight but its not flimsy like you would expect. There is no rubberized handgrip, which I think was a mistake to omit this on this camera. Especially since its predecessor (and its competitors) have them. Outside of that, the hand grip is a very nice size. The one upshot to the lightweight plastic is that the camera feel very light with the kit lens attached.One thing you have to watch out for is that the camera feels very out of balance when attaching a heavier lens. The Canon EF-S 18-200, while a good performer optically when paired with the T3, feels way too front heavy. And this will be true with a lot of the pro-grade Canon lenses that you attach to the T3. That said, this camera is a perfect DSLR for hiking due to its light-weight design (when used with the kit lens). It doesn't weigh you down or make you feel like you have a boat anchor around your neck.The buttons and menu system have the typical degree of straight-forwardness found in most Canons. Canon's menu system is easy to learn and navigate through. That makes the T3 a good candidate for a student or someone that wants to learn photography in general and wants a camera they can grow with. Of course it offers full Auto mode but when you're ready to try and manipulate the more advanced manual controls, the Canon Rebel T3 is about as unintimidating as they come. It's also a great entry into the DSLR realm for hobbyists currently using an advanced point and shoot (and can be found for almost the same price as some advanced point and shoots).With the exception of burst shooting, this camera's performance is excellent. Excellent start-up, shot-to-shot, and autofocus performance. It has 9 autofocus points compared to its predecessor's 7 points. I do not reccommend this camera as a budget action shooter. It has a slow continuous burst rate (2.7fps) and a very limited buffer. The Nikon D3200 shoots at 4 frames per second, but that is currently retailing for $200 more than the T3. So you'll have to decide whether or not that feature is important to you.The camera comes with a nice, chunky battery which delivers excellent battery life. The viewfinder is 95% coverage and I found it to be satisfactory, some people say its really cramped but personally I think it's alright. The screen resolution is rather low at 230k, but in real-world use it's not as bad as you would think, and somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. I think both the viewfinder and the LCD are of better quality than the ones found on the Nikon D3100. And overall, the T3 is faster and more fluid than the D3100. After having shot with both cameras, I personally think the T3 is more enjoyable to shoot with... despite the D3100's better plastic and more advanced spec sheet.The camera ships with the standard 18-55 kit lens but I suggest buying the kit which includes the additional 55-250 lens. The kit lens is sufficiently sharp but it might be worth investing in the newer 18-55 STM lens, as it is reportedly sharper than the 18-55 lens included with this camera.Despite having a sensor that is of lower resolution than the newer Rebel SL1 and Rebel T5i (12 megapixels is still plenty for everyday use), the camera has image quality that pretty much matches or exceeds those cameras in most areas. It takes a very clean shots up to and including ISO1600 and has excellent dynamic range, color reproduction, and exposure. The camera does a nice job of balancing noise reduction with detail retention up through about ISO3200. And despite being 2 1/2 years old..it still competes very well with newer models on the image quality front.The movie mode, while delivering solid video quality, is rather limited. It's 1280x720 HD and there are very limited manual controls. It's more like something you would use for quick clips rather than longer videos or movies. I think the Rebel T5i & SL1 are better choices if you're equal parts into videos and photos as they have far better video modes than the T3 does. But if you're main interest is stills photography, this probably won't matter much to you.The Rebel T3 may not be the sexiest camera around but it is a simple, enjoyable camera to shoot with that delivers nice results with minimum effort and it appeals to a broad range of folks from DSLR newbies, to hobbyist, to even professionals looking for a light-weight backup to their higher end gear. At its current price, it is a great value and I highly reccomend it.Sidenote: For those that haven't heard, this camera is being replaced by the recently announced Rebel T5, which is supposed to start shipping in March. The T5 has a higher resolution 18MP sensor, improved LCD resolution and size, a more robust movie mode, and an overall better build to it. Regardless, this should put even more downward price pressure on the T3 due to retailers unloading their remaining stock. Despite the newer model being released, if you're into stills photography only, the T3 remains a great buy.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great bang for the buck", "Author": "W. Stewart \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R1MOAOIWLTPXQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the camera is an amazing buy for the money. I was able to unpack the contents & begin shooting good pictures IMMEDIATELY, using the fully automatic settings & the included partially charged battery.  You will however, need to supply an SD Card as this is not included, not even a small one.The menu was a LITTLE confusing at first, but I quickly got the gist of things and am taking good pictures with the camera.  Having used the full-auto settings and just dabbling with the advanced settings, I'm very pleased with the purchase and I think anyone who is either new to DSLR cameras or who doesn't want to spend over $1000 for a 'pro' or 'prosumer' DSLR will also be very happy with it right out of the box... or ANY of the T series cameras for that matter.If you're going to be shooting in RAW (or like I do in RAW+L) I recommend getting AT LEAST a 16GB card, if not a 32GB card.  The included battery is a champ.  It lasts a good long time & charges quickly.  I was going to get a 2nd battery, but I don't think it's necessary at this time as it lasts for several hundred shots.  The manual says it takes 2 hrs to charge a fully depleted battery, but the math doesn't work out that way.  The included charger is portable & charges the included 860mAh Li-Ion battey at a 580mAh rate, so a full charge should be about 1.5hrs.  I'll have to time it when I need a full charge & have the spare time to check it every 10 mins or so beyond the 1hr mark.Only a few negatives:* When using the fully automatic settings indoors the white balance is just a little off, but this is fairly common w/all brands in the entry-level range.  It can easily be corrected in photoshop, or by manually choosing one of the white balance lighting scenarios (incandescent bulb, fluorescent, or sun) depending on your situation.  My outdoor shots look great on full auto settings.* Having not used an SLR type camera in a NUMBER of years (I've never owned a DSLR), I found that the manual it comes with is not very thorough, and neither is the larger PDF manual on the included CD.  However; it's not Canon's job to teach you photography and therefore I think the manual is just adequate.  The only real trouble I had was trying to figure out how to attach the included eyepiece cover when shooting on a tripod w/studio lighting using auto exposure settings... it's not explained anywhere.  You need to slide off the cover that is there already (the eye cushion) and slide on the cover... duh!  Cripes O Mighty!  They explain how to attach the camera strap (like you really need to read that...), but not the eyepiece cover?!  Those experienced with SLR photography don't need any more, those totally new are covered by both the instuctions & the quick-start guide; but, those in-between won't find the info they're looking for here... get this book:  Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))* There is no memory card included.  Even a tiny one would be appreciated for the completely new user to start shooting right away when buying the 'kit' version.  It may be the 1st D-SLR for the majority of it's purchasers, but it's probably not anyone's 1st digital camera in general.. so you probably have one of these lying around already.* A textured grip would be nice, but like the exclusion of a memory card, this is helping to keep the price down on this puppy.In summary:Is it a good camera for the $$:  Yes, 4/5*Is it a good camera in general:  Yes, 4/5 (auto white balance could be better, textured grip would be nice)Is the 'kit' worthwhile:  Yes, 4/5 (including even a tiny SD Card would be nice for the camera newbie)Good instructions:  Barely, 3/5Would I buy it again: YES(1)Recommend to a friend:  YES(1)Overall rating:  4/5* Revised due to recent price drop on T4i, see 4/6/2013 update at the bottom(1) If you can't afford the T4i**-- Update - 6/1/2012 --**Took it to Jones Beach last weekend, for the Memorial Day airshow.  After walking around to find some other Canon users, I learned how to use some of the manual settings in order to get shots of the fast-moving airplanes & jets flying around.  I didn't need help in so much as how to change the settings on the camera... but more what settings I would need to be using.Anyway... I got some GREAT shots!  The only issue I had was my telephoto lens didn't have IS, so I had a very fast shutter speed manually entered to make up for any hand shaking.  The result is that while the jet shots look great, I have stationary propellers on the older aircraft.  That's not the fault of the camera, but of my inexpensive EF 75-300mm non-IS lens.  Now if only someone can teach me how to use photoshop effectively :)Here are just a couple of shots from that airshow:  [...]**-- UPDATE 4/6/2013 --**OK, so I've had this camera for nearly 2 years now, and I'm still very happy with it.  However; the T4i has come down quite a bit in price due to the announcement that it's being replaced by the T5i.  Excellent timing for those of you looking to purchase a DSLR!!  If you can spend a little more, I'd recommend the T4i over the T3 by a wide margin.  Otherwise, T3 is still the way to go.Here's why:1. It's got the new DIGIC 5 Image Processor (Every other Rebel has DIGIC 4) - This is quite an improvement, especially with white balance.2. More ISO options - in combo w/the new DIGIC 5, this is a pretty big deal3. It's faster...  can shoot up to 5.0 frames per second, continuously - That's a big deal if you shoot sports/action/aviation.4. You get 18MP - That's fairly significant.5. In-camera HDR Combines multiple exposures - You probably will want this feature, even if it doesn't interest you right now.6. That little 'i' lets you use a wireless remote shutter release - may be significant, depends on what YOU need.7. Slightly larger LCD (3\" vs 2.7\") that flips out - significant.8. Touch screen - Mostly Bells & Whistles here, but reviews state it's very functional & intuitive.To sum this all up, with the T4i you'd gain: better images/video, high ISO performance, touchscreen, less shutter lag, and a few other things. This camera offers many new technologies and additions from Canon that aren't seen on any other camera in their line up (including much pricier cameras like the 60D). If you're wondering about the upcoming T5i... it's the T4i with a new body sculpt, real-time preview of Creative Filters in Live View mode, and a redesigned new mode dial that turns 360 degrees... that's IT!!  Same image quality & Features as the discontinued T4i!! By the way, the T4i (and upcoming T5i) outperform the much pricier 60D in terms of image quality (seriously, it does... 60D is getting long in the tooth now). The 60D's advantage is that it is weather sealed and has controls laid out more like a pro body (it has a rear dial just like the 7D, 5D, 1D bodies.) It was a clear upgrade over anything in the Rebel line until the T4i was introduced.Regards,Bill", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "nakiska", "ReviewID": "R37U1EC1Q1BV3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a few days ago and I've had nothing but FUN with it!  Aside from my simple Kodak Easyshare point and shoot, I had a Canon EOS Elan 7 (35mm) and had been wanting to switch it over to Digital for several years.  The longer I waited, the better the camera's got and more affordable they became.I decided on the Canon T3 mostly because of the affordable price. (Nearly 1/2 of the T3i)  I felt like I was getting a very good value for my money.  I was right!This camera takes amazing photo's! Clear, crisp, true color.It's very easy to use, right out of the box.Fit's all my old lenses and the remote from the Elan 7All the advanced manual settings I could want topped with the instant gratification of seeing how the settings affect the picture instantly.This camera allows you to use live screen shooting which so many people like these days and it takes HD video.The 12 megapixels is plenty even when enlarging OVER 11 x 14\".For a lower end Canon DSLR, it's a huge value for the money.  This camera is an excellent choice for the hobbiest/enthusiast.I am SOO glad I purchased it!Nakiska", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Entry Level DSLR With Tons of Features", "Author": "Matthew Coenen \"Ah. Books.\"", "ReviewID": "R3KMXHSCN3Q2JN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Back in the mid 1980s, I purchased a Canon EOS 650 -- one of their first autofocus film cameras -- to use as my high school's yearbook editor and photographer. I absolutely loved the camera; my nephew recently inherited it, and he loves it as well. It took amazing pictures. Offered a plethora of features. And has lasted over 20 years.However, prior to purchasing the T3, I did my research regarding entry-level DSLR cameras, and had narrowed it down to the Nikon D3100 and the T3. Yes, the Nikon offers higher megapixels. Yes, the Nikon has better HD video modes. However, much wanting an e-reader for the specific purpose of reading books, I wanted a DSLR camera that would take amazing pictures -- not record state-of-the-art video. I have a video camera for that. (As an aside, I've shot some video with the T3, and the quality is fine for stuff like YouTube or personal blogs. If you're a user wanting more than that, I'm unsure why would would be using your DSLR for video in the first place.)I chose the T3. And could not be happier.Other things I like about the T3?1. Canon is known for outstanding image quality. Their CMOS sensor and DIGIC processor combine to produce some of the best (if not _the_ best) images in the industry.2. Canon lenses -- even the less expensive ones made for \"prosumers\" (professional consumers who often don't spend more on a lens than the actual camera body itself cost) -- are extremely high quality.3. Speaking of lenses, great ones are also available from third-party vendors. In fact, I purchased a 50-200 zoom lens from Sigma, and it works perfectly with the T3. It was also quite a bit less expensive than the Canon alternative.4. Very lightweight. (I actually like the body construction and materials used.)5. Features? Tons. And the menu system is rather easy to navigate. Yes, I'm aware another reviewer has been rather negative regarding the Canon interface; however, do your research. Many DSLR users prefer the Canon menu system to those of other manufacturers. It can be confusing, but only if you are a complete novice to photography and know nothing about the actual art. If you want to turn a camera on and push a button or two, a DSLR is not what you need. If you want to have more control (complete control, even) over your results and are willing to take the time to learn the vocabulary and skills necessary, then you are ready for a DSLR.6. Detailed manual. Yes, it's long. Yes, it's detailed. But with so many features and combinations of settings, I'd much rather have detail versus \"the basics.\" (Though there is a \"basics\" version as well). The T3 is not a toy. It's a tool. As with any tool, you need to take the time to learn to use it effectively.7. 12.2 MP is an ideal amount for an entry-level DSLR and results in great detail. If you are wanting to enlarge your images to wall-mural size, you're better off using a film camera anyway.8. I'm content with the video features offered because I will rarely (if ever) use my DSLR for video recording. I have a dedicated digital-video camera for that.

I have shot all recent canon DSLRs (7D, 60D, T2i, T3i...) and I'm looking for a light travel/casual shooting camera to upgrade my XSI.  I thought the T3i was it, but after trying out this camera, I think this is the cam I was looking for.  Have the cam for a few days now.  The build quality is a little better than what I would expect from an entry level cam.  It's nice and light.  The menu is simple but still offers a lot of nice custom settings.One thing to keep in mind is that the low resolution LCD doesn't always tell the whole story.  My initial test photos look rather ordinary under this LCD.  However, when I view them in my desktop, they are a lot nicer.  In any case, that isn't a concern for me as the LCD is just for preview anyway.Color/saturation is spot on.  ISO performance is what surprised me.  I took a photo in 3200ISO, uploaded it to my website (unprocessed) and ask my photography-savvy friends to guess what ISO it was.  Most of them say 400 or 800, 2-3 stops off the mark.  It's so amazing, the stock lens is now totally usable indoor.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for first-time DSLR users or advance users who need a light walk-around or travel cam.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "travel_bug", "ReviewID": "R1MHGW4UCVW50V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price of the camera, you wouldn't really expect much. However, that is completely false. For the small price, this camera really packs a big punch. It was a no-brainer for me to choose Canon for my first DSLR. Every single camera I've ever owned is a Canon, and I've never been disappointed. This camera is great for the beginner photographer, and even for the more advanced photographer. It's a breeze to learn how to work all of it's functions and most importantly, it delivers such amazing quality photos. The kit comes with a 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 image stabilization lens. Even with a moderately wide aperture, the lens performs exceptionally well under low-light situations. I will eventually grow out of this lens, but for now it's doing well for me. I feel like as I grow in my photography, this camera will grow with me and last me years to come. One of my goals is to become a freelance photographer.

But, definitely, one of the biggest motivators for me was its price. You do get what you pay for with this camera and if you're new to the DSLR world, you'll be impressed by its ease of use, size and weight and simple functionality.I've been doing mostly portrait photography and the kit lens (18-55 IS II f/3.5-5.6) that came with the T3 performs very well. The images are sharp and to tell the truth, 12.2 MP was more than enough for me. I've ordered prints online and they look amazing.There are only two complaints I have about this camera. First, I was used to picking up higher end DSLRs and noticed the composition of the bodies was a lot more solid. The T3's body, at times, seems a little too plastic. Second, I would have loved for Canon to have placed a grip on the front part of the camera where one's hand is positioned near the shutter button.This camera will appeal to you if you want the speed, functionality and improved photographic capabilities of a DSLR but are not yet ready to go full speed and buy a higher-priced camera.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for first-time SLR owners", "Author": "Susy", "ReviewID": "RYFSM17UDI1IF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had some doubts about this camera when I looked online, but when I handled it for the first time, I was very impressed. Since my photography focus is horses, it was important to me to have a camera with no shutter lag and instantaneous recovery time between shots, which the T3 has.I also purchased a 55-250 IS zoom lens, a UV filter to protect the lens, and a class 10 Sandisk Extreme SD card. They have worked very well together and I haven't experienced any problems. The kit lens has enough zoom for most indoor shots, but outside, I nearly always use the 55-250 zoom lens instead.The battery life is great. I can take several extensive photoshoots before having to charge the battery. I use the manual settings more than the auto settings because I can set the AF points for more creative shots. The photo quality is great and images are sharp with good color (assuming you focused properly. :) )The video quality is very good at its original size but decreases significantly when displayed on a larger screen. One drawback is that once the recording is started, you can't zoom or change the focus. But it does have audio - although of medium quality.The onscreen interface was really helpful for me as an SLR newbie because each setting is briefly explained on the screen when settings are changed. The kit manuals are helpful and explained everything I needed to get started. I miss the textured grip, but find the smooth rubber easy to clean when I get dirty hands with the horses. The battery and card slots are on the bottom of the camera which means you can't set it down while it is open, but that's a relatively small issue.Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with the Canon Rebel T3 and would recommend it for first-time SLR owners like me.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great beginner DSLR", "Author": "Ms. Sean Crenwelge", "ReviewID": "RF228C4X433S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a 21 year old female in college and I bought myself this camera right before Thanksgiving. I paid, myself, $488, for it and for what you get, this is a great camera. Yes, some other people have said it is a little slippery and it looks \"cheapy\" but, I don't really care how it looks, I care how it performs. And I have utlized a few of the options such as \"Portrait,\" \"Full Auto,\" and \"Flash Off\" a lot within the few weeks I have had it and, gosh it is SO MUCH BETTER than a point a shoot. I have a Canon point and shoot and, thought that is nice because it's small, the picture quality started to annoy me. The Canon Rebel T3 has great picture quality, I am absolutely impressed. And, incase you are a newbie to camera buying, megapixels DO NOT matter with regards to picture quality; so don't think you have to buy a 18.8 megapixel camera to get a great picture. That just allows you to print bigger sized pictures (if you don't want the normal 4 x 6). So I have been using the \"Flash Off\" to take pictures of my cats and, I am truely impressed. On a point and shoot camera, it is almost useless to try and take a picture with the flash off, let alone for a moving object like a cat. The Canon Rebel T3 takes vivid pictures, it also takes great portraits and works well just with Full Auto. There are also Creative Options if you are a  photographer and want to tweak the settings yourself. I am a beginning photographer and I have not yet utilized these settings but I will update my review once I do so. This camera is also a very nice size if you want a better camera than a point a shoot but don't want to commit to a mammoth SLR. It is a great in-between size and could easily fit in a medium sized purse for a woman, if you so choose to carry it that way.

Some online reviews also nit pick this camera because it doesn't feel professional and lacks a super detailed screen.  While these are completely valid points, I find the fact that this camera out performs any short comings when in the hands of a beginner.  I am producing amazing results and am blown away with the flexibility of the options once I dig a little deeper into how to use them (P, Tv, Av)  I am finding myself becoming obsessed and always thinking about photography now that I have this tool to introduce me to this new world.  There is no contest in the pictures the S95 takes and this.  The battery life is ridiculous- I used it all afternoon shooting continuous high shutter speed in Av for about 600 shots and 7 minutes of HD video and its still showing that I haven't dented the remaining battery life.  I also picked up a 55-250MM IS lens which has made my zoom range cover a good distance so I'm able to take pictures at sporting events from the stands.  The kit lens is more than adequate for simple portraits and landscapes.  Definitely get a flash though, the flash range on this one is pretty much a joke.  I can safely recommend this camera to anyone looking to step up to a DSLR but doesn't want to dive right into a 1000 dollar system.  Eventually, I can see myself growing out of this camera.

Kennedy", "ReviewID": "R3J3C6UXV8DAV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera offers a wide spectrum of features.  Point and shoot enthusiasts will love the results.  Manual photographers will have to learn a few buttons and menus, and will be rewarded with great shots for their efforts. The \"Q\" button is the secret to navigating the on-screen menu.  Manual shoot offers a quick wheel to change the shutter speed, but you'll have to hold down the \"AV +/- trash\" button while simultaneously spinning the wheel to change the aperture setting.  It's the same wheel/button combo for exposure compensation in other modes.I graduated from a Canon G5 to this T3 DSLR and I am very pleased with the upgrade.  I'm able to utilize some of the Canon menu and navigation from the G5, and with a little help from the pdf version of the manual, I quickly acquainted myself with the M, Av, Tv, & P settings.  The 8 basic modes are self-explanatory.  The \"A-DEP\" automatic depth-of-field setting is just more icing on the cake.At this price point it's a bonus that the camera shoots video.  \"Entry-level\" DSLR cameras are a strange breed: avid photographers bemoan their lacklustre features, while point and shoot graduates are offered many features that they will probably never use.  A good photographer can take great shots with an old Pentax K1000 + an appropriate lens, and this T3 offers the same high performance potential at a very reasonable price, plus it's point and shoot results are fabulous.

In terms of picture quality when compared with higher end models all the way to the 60D, it is difficult to determine any differences between them.The biggest sacrifices are ergonomics and features like frames per second and flip screens, but I have to tell you that it is a great starting point for any enthusiast wanting to discover DSLR photography. ISO 6400 is really helpful when compared with models like the XS which Canon stop showing in their website; the XS was Canon's entry level before the T3 but it only had ISO 1600 (useless). ISO 6400 with Photoshop Lightroom 3 makes unwanted grain a thing of the past.The camera is small and convenient; I recommend buying the body only and getting and upgraded lens instead of using the 18-55 kit les that comes with it. Good quality pictures come from high quality lenses, so save the money from the kit lens, and buy an upgraded lens like the Canon 24-70L for people with money or the Tamron 17-50 2.8 for people on a budget that want a good balance between price and quality.The bottom line is the lens is more important than the camera if comparing all Canon models under $1000.00.

(My primary camera is a Canon 5D MkII.) I am very impressed with the performance and image quality of this Rebel T3, and recommend it to anyone searching for a high quality dSLR.Here's what is Most Impressive about the Rebel T3:* Very light weight and easy to carry, yet Very solid design and craftsmanship* Auto-white Balance is impressively improved over older models* High-ISO (low light) performance is also amazing -- detail is preserved even at ISO 3200* Tethered to a computer, this model works seamlessly and naturally* The menus have built-in descriptions that can be enabled or disabled in accordance with the shooter's familiarity with the camera -- this is immensely useful* Video quality is exceptional, and having a separate mode for video greatly simplifies use* The menus are the same great Canon system that they've been perfecting and refining with each new release* Bright and colorful LED screen* Full compatibility with hundreds of models of lensesHere are what I consider the compromises:* The rear button system is a little different than the higher-end models, but almost as easy to use. I think this is a consequence of the smaller body size, mostly.* No informational LCD. Instead the LED screen displays the information, or you see the details through the viewfinder. This is inconvenient, but again probably due to the size.* No depth-of-field preview button* SD memory cards only -- not CF like older Canon modelsAltogether, I consider the compromises to be minor and mostly unimportant when it comes to actually taking photos. What you are getting with the Rebel T3 is the latest imaging technology in a small, compact, affordable body. It is a reliable, professional-level gateway into digital imaging. There are only minor compromises, which ultimately do not greatly affect the image. I feel confident in declaring that my skill level is the limiting factor on this camera, not its technical specifics.Regarding lenses, I cannot speak about the included kit lens since I immediately sold it (the \"body only\" box was not available at the time). The lenses I've primarily used in the month I've had the Rebel T3 have been the EF 28mm f/1.8, which provides a \"normal\" field of view, the EF 100mm f/2, which is ideal for head/face portraiture, and the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS, which is an excellent lens for travel and casual shooting, with very modern Image Stabilization. All three have performed excellently on this camera.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Amateur Purchase EVER!", "Author": "R.

I've been using were not getting the job done.  My son is 5 and he's in basketball and tee ball and he'll be starting school soon and I needed a camera that I could rely on to take awesome pictures.  Well, after reading several reviews I went to the exchange today and purchased this camera.  I brought it home and charged the battery while I read the manual a little and installed the software from the included disks.  Well, as soon as that light turned green, I popped the battery and a memory card into the camera, turned it on using the sports setting and went outside to take pictures of my husband and son playing basketball.  WOW! WOW! WOW!  OMG that's all I can say!  NO BLUR AT ALL IN THE ACTION SHOTS!!!!!!!  That's all I wanted.  I could have purchased another \"bridge\" camera, you know the SLR like point and shoot cameras, but I went with this one because it was only $60 more and I thought if I liked it, then I can get better acquainted with the functions and maybe get different lenses and accessories later on.  I'm so glad I decided on the T3.  I looked hard at the T3i, mostly because of that moveable LCD display, but the price was right on the T3.  Oh, and I know that this may make me sound dumb, but I had no idea that this camera has a built in flash.  It has the slide on top where you would slide in a flash piece, but little did I know that there was one built in.  If that was mentioned in the specifics online, I totally missed it.  Anyway, I was taking some pictures inside and when I pushed the button to take a picture, the flash popped up right away and I got a great photo!  I haven't had to think about a thing thus far except when I set the date and time when I first turned the camera on and when trying to figure out how to get the live view on the display screen.  BELIEVE me, if you're thinking about buying this camera and you're not a professional but would like to take great photos, stop thinkging and just buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  I've been through so many cameras that I could have just bought the T3i outright.  I'm sure I'll keep my cybershot for spur of the moment things since it's small and more portable.

Pics are better than P&S; pics, so most give this five stars (due to the MUCH larger sensor in this compared to almost any P&S; the same is true for all DSRs).  I'd advise getting a Canon T3i or T2i if you can stretch a bit.  Feels better in the hand, more capabilities, better build quality (e.g., articulating, high res LCD), better features.  For other new DSLR users, try the Nikon D3100 if you prefer which comes with a pretty good kit lens and is better built than the T3 --- do not get the Nikon D3000 which is cheaper but uses old tech and is not worth its cheap price.  An idea is to skip the T3 with the Canon kit lens (if one still wants this camera) and get the Canon 50mm/1.8 for nicer pics and probably at a cheaper (or similar) price.This DSLR is like a starter DSLR or starter motorcycle or starter house --- you'll probably want a better one soon enough and can save money by buying it now for not much more.

You should be fingering through reviews of much higher grade photographic equipment.  However if you do believe that you are indeed, a beginner, then purchase this camera, it's an amazing deal.  Be warned, this IS NOT, a professional level camera, if your shots look soft, it's more than likely the quality of the kit lens that comes with this camera.  When opened to the widest aperture, pictures will be soft across the frame.  The lens needs to be stopped down to at least f5.6 to achieve repairable sharpness.

Besides, I had a great deal of money invested in my old Canon Rebel camera and lenses.  Finally, I made the shift, and will never look back.  I needn't belabor the advantages of digital vs. film: by now, everybody must know those.  Let me add only my own pluses: this camera takes fabulous photos, and the picture is not dependent on a selected film.  I get rich, deep colors that I only got with film by serendipity.  I own a Kodak as well; just an inexpensive thing received as a gift.  But that camera is so slow that the final picture is milliseconds later than what you viewed: the dog has moved from that perfect pose by the time the photo is captured, for example.  This camera captures a photo so quickly that you get what you aimed for.  Plus, the inexpensive Kodak takes poor photos in low light.  I have taken pictures at night with the Canon, no flash (outdoors, for example) and get a flawless photo.  It has features that make even a novice (petit moi, for example) get great photos.Alas! one reason I purchased it as opposed to another was that it touted itself as being compatible with the expensive lenses I'd bought for my film Rebel.  It is not: those lenses work intermittently, when at all (I get \"cannot communicate with the lens\" errors most of the time).  So I have to start saving money to purchase all new lenses (which actually add up to much more than the camera itself).

The camera itself is more than capable of most anything you'll want it to do. The shooting mode options are similar to those on the canon rebel film SLR, and allow the beginner to transition to manual as they become more comfortable with less-automated shooting modes.When you get the kit, there won't be a memory card included, so make sure you've picked one up (16GB would be the lowest I'd recommend, especially if you're a beginner experimenting by taking the same picture a few different ways, it's nice not to have to worry about filling up the memory card. Also if you're using larger file sizes like RAW, the larger card is a good idea.). Otherwise the kit includes everything you need to get started.The manual is okay, though the pdf it comes with doesn't particularly elaborate on anything in the paper manual. However, the camera itself is pretty easy to figure out , especially for someone who is even a little familiar with SLRs, digital or otherwise.I found the battery life to be excellent, and there's a handy indicator on the screen to let you know when it gets down to half. It seems to charge pretty quickly, a couple of hours at most.The pictures it takes are true to life and look very professional. It's a lot of fun for someone just getting into digital photography or for the hobbyist with some familiarity. I'd strongly recommend picking up a camera bag, you'll find yourself wanting to take this camera with you wherever you go. If you want a little more freedom than the kit lens provides, a good option to consider is an 18-300 lens that will let you get some telephoto capability without sacrificing the ability to grab that picture of your friends sitting next to you.Overall:worth the money?

This is my first dSLR and I have to say this is a perfect camera.PRO's:- This camera allows for a great diverse menu system for each mode, which gives tool tips for each setting. Its great for those who are unsure of what a setting will do, this will actually tell you what to expect.- Its menu once you understand SLR features you will find out how to make this camera perfect for fast pictures and great detail with contrasts of colors and shapes.- Its shutter speed and overall night pictures can be made to look stunning.- In my first night with this camera, I took some test pictures that once I understood the different modes and  shutter settings, all it took was a bit of a steady arm and I made lit up house walkways look like something from a movie. (Don't get me wrong its not \"Movie\" style, but when you come from a Point and Shoot camera user to a SLR you go up 10 folds of quality so its just amazing.)- It stores 2,100 pictures on a 16GB SD Card, which isn't bad I think for 12MegaPixel camera.- A LOT of different modes. This camera can go up to ISO 6400 which is insane, and if you hold your hand right you can make the most stunning pictures with no flash. You can easily become a photographer if you just take the time to test the modes and settings. When I looked at friends camera's they always made it seem like it was very difficult to use them, but after a full day of testing using different settings, to take pictures at restaurants, at the mall at mountain sides its very great quality.CONS: (Yes I do have Cons....) But to me doesn't effect the score of the camera- To me i'm not used to the bulkyness of SLR's its something I got to get used to, but if you have a smaller wife or kids they may have a harder time holding it. So it just depends on the user and family.- It only zooms to 5x I thought when I bought it it defaulted @ 5x and went up to 10x but I was mistaken, its the only thing thats hard w/ the stock lens. But soon as I get back from my trip i'll be buying a better lens.- Its battery is pretty spendy but I guess thats normal for majority of SLR's so I don't think its per-say a negative just you can't bring along an extra pack of batteries just in case.....CONCLUSION:I love this camera so far, its a little bulky but its the price of having better picture quality. It also wasn't bad for consistency you can see the amount of reviews over its product lifespan. All of this made it clear to spend the extra $150 and get this model. For anyone who wants to get a great starter dSLR go with this model, it comes with a lens and flash. Don't be fooled! This camera has a popup flash, I seen the connector and ALMOST passed it up because I was unaware it popped up.So go have fun w/ this camera, just don't get discouraged with the features, for all those who didn't think this generated great images, its only because they didn't understand the settings and the features. Its all about the right setting for the right scene, just like a movie.

I was going on a 3 week vacation and decided I wanted to take higher quality pictures of my trip and upgrade from a digital point and shoot to an entry level DSLR.I would highly recommend this camera for those NEW to DSLR photography. I have had an awesome time using it during the last 2 1/2 months and take it with me everywhere. I picked up the Canon EFS 55-250mm lens to enable capture from longer distance as the kit lens only goes up to 55mm.I just picked up the Canon 50mm 1.8, along with a Sigma filter and a fotodiox hood to add to my arsenal and looking forward to playing with that in a couple of days.Pros:The price is great for what you are getting. If I had the extra dough, I would have went with the T3i. However, since this is my first DSLR and I am planning on selling this when I ACTUALLY know what I really want from an SLR, I went with this model to get me started.Cons:I think the kit lens is only OK. If you want to spare some $$, only get the body, and order the 50mm 1.8 (I will confirm how this performs with the T3 once I get time to play with it).You will be missing some functions found in higher models such as an IR receiver. I also don't have S1, S2 modes which would've been nice for easier set up with slave flashes.Another feature I would've loved, is the self-cleaning mirror. I still have to figure out how to clean it myself or just take it in for service to a professional, and I would prefer to do it myself.The body is light compared to higher models of course but really, it is well built and GOOD ENOUGH. Just take care of your camera and it should last a very long time (crossing fingers)This is one of my first reviews and again this is coming from someone who has only been into this for the past couple of months. However, I have taken over 10,000 photos and have been very happy with my results. After a year or two, I plan on upgrading to a higher model canon. During the next couple of years however, I plan on investing in the higher model lenses to give me better photos. Hopefully by learning on a lower model body, it will be an awesome feeling when I finally get that Canon that will cost 3 times as much as this one.Bottom line: Highly recommended for those looking to get started with DSLR photography and are on a budget. However if you have that extra $300 to spend to get a step or two higher models, I'd say go for it and you will probably not want to upgrade ever since you will have most of the features you could ever want. Then again I am starting to realize this is an addictive hobby and better gear really does mean better results. However, I'm sure there are pros out there that can get awesome shots with this alone..

You don't necessarily need 10 frames per second to shoot fast moving things, you just have to think a little more about what you are doing.12.2 mega pixels.  If you have done any research on MP's, then you should know that more MP's doesn't mean better quality.  The lens has much more to do with quality.  I get amazing picture quality with this.  I had some 8 x 10's printed and they are crystal clear.  I wouldn't hesitate to get larger prints either.Some people have complained that it \"feels\" cheap in your hands.  Canon sacrificed some of the rubbery feel of the grip to get the price down.  There is still rubber on the grip, though.  I have been shooting with this for a year, I have no problem with how it feels.  Fact of the matter is, you would get used to how a camera feels regardless, so unless you have had super rubbery grips before and just can't imagine anything less, than you won't have a problem.Screen doesn't tilt out.  Sure, that would have been nice, but I got used to it and don't care.Screen is only 2.7\", instead of 3\" like the next model up.  Big deal.  Screen looks great.Max shutter speed: 1/4000 sec.  This is plenty fast, trust me.  I couldn't afford f1.2 lens to shoot with in the full brightness of the sun anyway.  I rarely have to shoot that fast anyway, even with my f2 50mm lens, I still don't often get above 1/3200 sec.9 autofocus points, center is cross type.  If you don't know what that means, don't worry.  More cross type would be nice, but whatever.  I trust my eyes, and I don't often use autofocus anyway.  But when I do, its great.No dedicated DOF button.  Again, if you don't know what that is, don't worry.  If you do, you can customize one of the other buttons to do this, but I rarely if at all use it anyway.The battery life on this is amazing.  I use my camera at least a little everyday, and when I really go out to use it heavily, the battery just goes and goes.  I go weeks between charges.  Additional batteries for this camera are only about $12 bucks anyway.It's not weather sealed.  Big deal, I don't like walking around in the rain anyway.  I have been out in light rain with no problems, but if I had spent a lot more money on a weather sealed camera, I would probably hesitate more to get it wet.  Being out in the extreme cold in a dry bag hasn't bothered it either.This is a fantastic camera.  I primarily shoot full manual in raw, adjustments are quick and intuitive, picture quality is amazing, build quality is great.  I tend to take care of my things anyway.  I carry this around in a neoprene case in my timbuk2 bag pretty much everywhere I go and it gives me no problems.  The menues are easy to navigate, buttons are comfortable.  I use it with a speedlight, works great.Here's a tip.  If you are like me and don't have oodles of money, this is a great camera at a great price.  The kits lens is fine, not great.  I have the 55-250 zoom lens (less than $200 bucks), and I love it.  Will it shoot in a very dimly lit room? Not very well, again, not a big deal.  It actually has really great shallow depth of field at 55mm f4.  Since I shoot in manual, I purchased an old nikon 50mm f2 lens, with an adapter (adapter on amazon for about $10), and it is awesome.  Manual lenses on ebay are super cheap compared to their newer fully auto siblings.  If you can shoot manual (which you should learn to do anyway), then this is an inexpensive way to get great quality lenses for a fraction of the price.  My old nikon lens is 38 years old but shoots like it's brand new.  I also purchased a step up ring on amazon (about $7), which adapts the nikon 52mm thread to canon 58mm, so I can use my canon sized filters and caps.Don't think that you have to spend more money on a dslr to get better pictures.

Just a standard guy who decided he didn't have enough pictures of things and wasn't satisfied with documenting his life with a cell phone camera.I read up on cameras for a while I came down to this one or the T3i. My parents both have a T3 themselves and I was pretty happy with the results I got playing around with those. Looking at the main differences between the two, (The ones I concerned myself with were primarily the large difference in resolution (12.2 MP on the T3 and 18 MP on the T3i) , the self-cleaning sensor (T3i), the 1080p (T3i) vs 720p (T3) video recording, and the external microphone jack (T3i))Obviously, I ended up going with the T3. Why, you ask? Well, I did some research and found that, when printing photos at 300 dpi (very high quality) you can get prints up to 14x9\"! I can't imagine a scenario in which an amateur like myself would need to print anywhere near that, so that eliminated my desire for the very high 18 MP count. Here's an illustration to explain it:[...]I heard great stories about the self-cleaning sensor, however, after looking up instruction on how to clean your sensor, it became clear that this feature would be handy on very rare occasions. Not to mention, keeping the autocleaning feature on increases the time it takes to go from \"camera off\" to \"taking photos.\" If I want to take a picture of something, I don't want to wait for my camera to groom itself; I want it now.The big drawback to this camera is its reduced functionality in taking video compared with its overachieving cousin. Don't get me wrong, it would be great to shoot video in 1080p and be able to use an external mic for sound versatility, but I bought this camera to take photographs. The fact that it takes video at all is just a bonus.By buying this camera instead of the T3i, I was able to get a nice zoom lens bundled with it for the same total price I would have paid for just the T3i kit. (Via the little offer a few sections under the price on the product page.)MY IMPRESSIONS:This is my first DSLR. It's a huge step up from my phone. With the included lens, I was almost immediately able to take the best pictures I've ever taken of my dog, my cats, my girlfriend, and anything I felt like shooting. I haven't tried all of the features because I like shooting in manual mode (Occasionally using autofocus when I'm feeling lazy) but I can say this thing is great. In good light, pictures come out crisp, clean, and vibrant. In bad light, with some adjustments and a steady hand, pictures come out crisp, clear, and vibrant! The HUD in the viewfinder makes the LCD unnecessary except for viewing pictures. When using autofocus or when holding the shutter button halfway while focusing, little red lights come up on a grid in the viewfinder to show you what you're focusing on. This feature really helps get a sharpness you can't even really perceive while you're shooting, only when reviewing photos later.When I flip the switch to turn the camera on, I can start shooting almost instantly. The time it takes to ready itself is less than what it takes for me to bring the camera up to my face.The video it takes, while not perfect, is way better than on my phone. I can't say anything about hearing the autofocus while shooting but you probably can. I just haven't used it while messing with the video function.Overall, I'd say this camera (the possibility of accidents aside) will last me more than long enough to master photography to the point that I can justify buying a professional level shooty picture machine.If you're a beginner, just wanting to take good pictures, look no further.

I know myself well enough to admit that I'm not going to learn all the features and shoot in manual mode.

Yes, under the perfect conditions it did take nice pictures.  But frankly with a squirmy infant the perfect conditions just didn't happen very often.  Most shots were ruined by blurriness from his movement or it just wasn't fast enough to capture the moment.My husband and son surprised me with this camera for my first Mother's Day.  I literally use it every single day and I have been amazed by the quality of the shots I can get.  The shutter snaps the picture the moment that you press it.  So I end up with all the cute smiles, laughs, and antics of my son...not the back of his head or side of his face because the moment is over.Admittedly, I only use the preprogrammed modes on this camera but my results have been amazing.

I think this is a fantastic camera for those who are just starting to get into advanced digital photography (this is my first SLR so I really have nothing else to compare it to). Images are crisp and clean, taking in so much detail. The settings took me some time to learn to figure out what I wanted to use majority of the time but I'm sure that will apply to anyone who went from using a point and shoot to an SLR for the first time since the variety of settings expands greatly when you take this step (hence why I gave the intuitive control rating four stars instead of five).The biggest selling points for me on this camera were (compared to the Canon EOS Rebel XSi which is what I was originally going to get):- the fact that the 12.1 MP is better compatible with the 15-85 mm IS II lens that came with the camera rather than having a higher number of MP- weight is lighter possibly because the grip is not made of a leather type material but it is still very comfortable to use- price ($100 cheaper than the XSi)Word of advice when you buy a new SLR camera, also buy a cheap UV filter. That way if for some reason (hope it doesn't actually happen though) something hits your camera lens, it will hit the filter instead which is way cheaper to replace than an entire lens.I have only had this camera for about a month now but so far it has not disappointed me. The booklets that come with the camera package that explain how to take specific pictures are also tremendously helpful. As for cons, as this is my first SLR camera it's hard for me to say but maybe size? I have read reviews stating that this camera is bigger than the XSi but the fact that it is lighter leaned me towards buying the T3.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm a professional photographer who used this in a pinch...", "Author": "C.

If the extra fetures like video and live view are important I can see this one. If high image quality and built quality are more important, save your money and pick up a 30D or even and old 10D($100 on Ebay)just note that the 10D cannot use Canon Brand EFS lenses, only EF mount.

My wife and I just returned from a trip to the mountains of Colorado looking for a new house, this was my first experience with this camera and it performed wonderfully. The pictures came out great both indoors and out. It didn't matter if the pictures were of close details, of far away views, landscapes or wildlife, the pictures are clear, in focus and the colors great. I have also downloaded pictures to my laptop and can zoom in with amazing quality. I used the basic zone modes of the camera all of the time and the only issue I had was I accidentally changed a feature where the pictures were delayed about 10 seconds and would take 2 pictures at a time but once I got back to my vehicle and walked through the menu I changed the camera back to \"normal\" mode without having to dig through the manual. Being the stereotypical man I just breezed through the instruction manual before starting to take pictures so I do not know all the ins and outs of the camera but I found this camera to be very simple to use and the menu system very easy to follow. I also purchased the Canon EF-S 55-250mm telephoto lens with this camera and I am very pleased with it as well.

They're light and compact, and of course cheap- the major draws. However I've found that my cellphone camera is pretty darn close in terms of picture-taking quality to these guys, and since I have it on me all the time anyway there's really not much point to bringing along a point-n-shoot (no pun intended). It also lasts a whole lot longer on battery power, which I've found to be a serious issue with many point-n-shoots. After all, it doesn't matter how good a camera is if the battery's dead.So yeah, for casual pictures the phone does the job just fine. However, I did still want something better for 'serious' photographs- the ones I'd actually print out rather than just post on Instagram. For that, I had the following criteria:1. Obviously, it has to take better pictures than a point-n-shoot or my phone. I define that by better optics/zoom, better sensor, focus, flash, higher FPS, low startup time, and higher ISO range for darker environments.2. It can't cost as much as my car (all right- unlikely, but I balk at the idea of spending more on a camera than a high-end laptop, and many 'prosumer' SLRs retail at over $1000).3. It can't weigh a ton or be so unwieldy that I can hardly use it anyway.4. The battery has to last for more than a half hour of photo shooting. I'm being serious here- I've seen quite a few point-n-shoots that can't do this.5. Handy non-touchscreen controls. I know touch controls are all the rage these days, and if done properly they work fine. But when they aren't they really really suck. Additionally, they mean you need a LCD on to use them which drains a lot of power.Things I didn't particularly care about:1. Video taking ability. It's nice to have, but I wouldn't be shooting video with this anyway.2. Outrageous megapixel count. It's really not necessary since I don't intend to print posters. In fact I find it more of a nuisance than anything else due to increased file size.The EOS Rebel T3 was my choice. I wavered for a while, considering some others like the T3i and Nikon D3200, but decided they didn't offer enough added capabilities to be worth the huge increase in price (at this point, either costs about $200 more). This camera is available in two packages- with or without the 19-55mm lens. I got it with the lens and am very pleased with it in general.For a relative noob like myself, the camera has fully automatic modes and a variety of 'semi-automatic' shooting modes. They cover practically every common scenario you might shoot with. There's also full manual for those who know a bit more, which I admittedly don't. However straight out of the box it's very easy to use this camera- there's on-screen directions for the settings and the button and dial design is intuitive. In a place that doesn't need flash? There's a no flash preset. Subject is moving fast? Sport mode. It's really hard to screw this up, and although it might not be quite as good as properly configured manual, it's really not bad.The camera shoots about 3 FPS, which is more than I usually need. It has a wide range of ISO settings and can take pictures well in moonlit darkness (though for this, you probably want a tripod as the exposure time is long). The optics are excellent as is to be expected, and autofocus is generally very quick. There are times if set to fully automatic mode that it can take a while to adjust- especially if the target is small or close. I find it's sometimes better to use quick focus settings if you think you might miss something. The flash automatically pops up when engaged and works decently well. If you want a bigger unit, there's a mount for it.Build quality in general is solid, and though heavier and bulkier than a 4/3 camera or point and shoot, it's not by any means unwieldy. It is clearly designed for right handed shooters though, as practically all the controls are on that side. The lenses are interchangeable, but the stock lens is a very good all-rounder. It might not have the craziest zoom, but so far I've found it works perfectly in most shooting situations. Battery life on this camera is fantastic despite the fact the battery pack is pretty small. It charges very fast via the (included) cradle and spares are cheap if you really want one. The camera supports SDXC up to 64GB, and at native 12.2 MP this is enough space for over 10,000 shots- more than I could possibly do in any given week (or probably even year). If you stick to the viewfinder it can easily last a full day on one charge.The controls include dials for quick settings, adjustments, and standard buttons for reviewing content and navigating menus. It also has a dedicated flash button, though this is often disabled in presets. The shutter button is a light press to focus, hard press to shoot- and generally very responsive. Image quality is superb in all conditions- you can definitely get some 'wow' impact from this, and I've had many friends comment on how good the stills are. I haven't tried shooting video with this, and probably never will- it's just not the purpose I got it for. On that note, the autofocus motor and camera click are quite loud. This is perhaps the only quibble I have with this camera, but it's not a huge issue for me. The camera has a very fast startup time- for all intents and purposes it's ready to go when you flip the switch.I'll acknowledge this is probably not the best DSLR out there in terms of feature set and sensor quality, but it's darn good for what you pay for it and is easy to use for neophytes. It's actually cheaper than many 4/3 cameras and about the same weight (though it is bulkier). I personally prefer the viewfinder, though my wife prefers shooting with the LCD. Either way, it works very well and can shoot often enough, fast enough, and for long enough that it's really hard to miss any photo-op.

If you're shooting sports or other action on a primary basis you may want to invest in something a little quicker.The thing about DSLR's is that you really only need a basic body. If you're going to invest money, invest it in your lenses. When you upgrade bodies, if you stay with the same brand or mount type (or get an adapter) you can continue to use your favorite lenses. This is a great body to start with. This camera, plus the 50mm 1.8 lens, may be all you ever need.I love this camera. It takes absolutely gorgeous photographs, it's a pleasure to use, and Canon hasn't changed their lens mount in a zillion years so I can use all my old 35mm SLR lenses and flash.

I received my first SLR camera, a Canon Rebel G2, when I was teenager and experimented with that for a while but never really took it past that. Many years later with the birth of my first child, I decided I really wanted to actively pursue photography as a hobby. After a few weeks of researching DSLR's I decided this was the one for me. It struck the ideal balance between features and price and seems to be a great camera for me to grow with. Sure, there might not be as many features as the T3i or T2i but for the price I really can't ask for a better camera.The camera feels very light which could explain why many refer to the \"cheap\" build quality in their reviews. However, there is nothing wrong with the build quality. With the right settings the pictures I have taken come out crisp and clear with a generally nice white balance. The menus, buttons, and dial are simple and easy to navigate through. The camera is easy enough for someone who is not familiar with DSLR's to take great photos using the preset modes. My husband took some lovely outdoor pictures of me and my son using the \"Portrait\" preset. The burst shooting is pretty good when shooting in JPEG (~3 fps) but slows down noticeably in RAW and fills the buffer after just a few shots. This hasn't really been an issue for me yet, though down the road it could prove problematic.The cons for me include not having a rubberized grip and the indoor white balance issue. As someone who is rather clumsy at times I would prefer to have a rubberized grip to help me keep a better grip on my camera but to overcome this I have resorted to just using my camera strap. The white balance is generally good but I have noticed that when shooting in low lighting there tends to be a rather annoying orange cast to the photos even when changing the white balance settings. This is easily overcome with some post-processing tweaks though.There are small issues, most notably with the indoor low-light white balance, but they are easily worked around. For me, the kit lens leaves a lot to be desired. I recently picked up the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens and I was not disappointed. My photos went from nice to \"Wow! You took that?\" I would highly recommend getting the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens with this camera.Overall, the Rebel T3 is a very nice entry-level DSLR capable of producing fantastic results for those looking to get started with DSLR photography and are on a budget.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera for the Price!", "Author": "Charles Hanson", "ReviewID": "R2WTQZBJQB34SB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is such a wonderful camera!

If you get things wrong there's always Adobe lightroom providing the images aren't to far gone.The view finder for me is a little bit on the small side and viewing the information in the view finder is difficult for me to view sometimes.I don't like how the battery and sd card slot are on the bottom, it makes it a pain when using a tripod. If you're card is full and you're using a tripod you have to unscrew it from the tripod and then take it out which sucks.The menu is semi informative for the noob shooter like me, when  you go into manual mode and you go to adjust a setting it tells you that if you increase a value or decrease a value what it will do for the picture.It comes with a 18-55mm kit lens,its ok for what it is just don't expect to zoom out very far the image quality with it is ok there's a little noise out low light levels but can be tweaked in adobe lightroom the good thing is that this camera is compatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses so that's good.Overall despite the minor flaws this camera has I would recommend it for the person that doesn't have the cash to step up to the T3I personally I would of stepped up to the T3I if I had the money but at the time I didn't but i'm perfectly happy with this model, it takes great pictures and that's all I can really ask for so yes id recommend people to buy this camera.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "great entry-level dslr, at a killer price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HIK7WE479RDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Keeping it simple - this is our first dslr, but view it as a stepping stone for sometime in the future. Comparing this against even the used options on craigslist, the price was just too hard to pass up ($510, amazon prime). The best used alternative would've been a similar entry-level, 2-5 years old, with two lenses if it was at the older end. Getting a new camera, with zero shutter actuations and a new battery was worthwhile, mainly because we knew we'd be hooked on dslr's once we got one. We had such good results with previous canon point-and-shoots, that we opted to go for the T3 over a Nikon D3100, despite the apparent disadvantages in specs. It's just so darn user-friendly, I can't imagine anything being easier, but I will say we are somewhat biased (I keep saying \"we\" - my wife and I are photo nerds, but mostly amateur, and between off-roading and outdoor adventures, to artsy photo creations, to indoor action with two young kids, we kinda cover a large range of \"users\"). After a short time with this camera, I won't go into the details as many others have. It just works well, and it's easy. Even better is that it's as helpful as you want it to be - very tunable in terms of auto functions and helpful hints, but easily removed if you gain experience and don't want to be babied.

At the start of the new semester, I saw this on sale and knew it would be a great fit for our newsroom.PROS:It's really light. I'm used to hauling around big camera bodies with heavy lenses (ex. Canon 300mm f2.8 L). So when I tried this camera out for the first time, it was a little surprising. However, for someone not used to the world of DSLR's, this is a great starting weight. Light and compact, it still feels great in my hands. I have yet to have a complaint by any of my staff on its handling as well.Image quality. I was expecting image quality on this to be not as good due to its price. However, after using it in the field for the past 6 months, it's stood up to all of our other cameras in this area. Great color reproduction and color accuracy. This is actually our go to camera when we do last minute portraits of people in the newsroom. We have yet to have a bad performance from this guy.There's no fancy stuff. It's sort of weird to say this, but it is nice to use this camera once in a blue moon. Most cameras these days have so many features that sometimes the photography itself gets overshadowed. With this camera, it's bare bones basic, which means just you and picture. In a way, it's a good test on how good of a photographer you really are. Get a great picture on this camera and you can get a great picture on any camera.CONS:It's really light. This is also a bad thing. Being a collegiate newsroom, we have some high quality glass, which, more often than not, tends to be heavy. As a result, the weight distribution tends to be off. Now, most people buying this camera won't be using L series primes and f2.8 zoom lenses. However, it is something to be aware of.The screen. To be blunt, it's pretty bad. It's actually so laughably low-resolution that you can see the individual pixels. However, it does do its purpose. Colors are accurate and the screen has decent angles. This also makes the Live View function moot. Yes, you could use it. However, without a decent screen, Live View becomes a super low-res version of your final product. Despite this being aimed at first time users, I really do wish Canon put a more high-resolution screen on this. Being able to see a picture on a high-res screen just makes common sense. Not a deal breaker, but a missed opportunity.OVERALL:Just to make a point, I shot an entire NCAA Men's Soccer game on this camera. Was it wise to do that? No. It only has 3 frames per second, its ISO tops out at a usable 3200, and it's not weather resistant at any level. Are these qualities I look for in a newsroom worthy camera? Not really. However, it is a great starter camera for new photogs. My new staff members are out and about taking newspaper quality photos that's easy to use and learn on. The same can be said of the soccer game. When I showed the pictures I took to a staff member, he couldn't believe I used the T3. That's the point of this camera. It has just enough to instill the confidence in a user so that they'll get the shot. Your pictures won't be blurry, they won't be insanely dark, and they'll be cropped just right. Since buying this camera for our newsroom, I've recommended this camera to 2 photogs who have bought, and used, this camera to great success.

My photography needs are just wanting to shoot quality pictures of my family in everyday life, holidays, & special events like graduation. My experience with digital photography over the past 10 years is Fuji Finepix A200, GE A730, 2 Sony Cybershots (not sure of the models), Fuji Finepix F900EXR, Fuji S8200, Samsung Galaxy S II, & Samsung Galaxy Note II (yes the latter two are not technically cameras but since many use their smartphones for point & shoots I will include them).I wish I would've made the move to dslr sooner. This is only an entry-level & the image quality compared to point & shoots is amazing.Autofocus using the viewfinder is immediate (if looking for this on a p&s; check out the Fuji Finepix F900EXR). Using the LCD screen, autofocus is slower, but I am beginning to understand the benefits of the viewfinder. I can definitely see the benefits of manual focus but not very good at it yet. I'll keep practicing.Colors turn out true to what I see with my eye. There is a lot of detail in each image. Possibly the term for the images I'm getting is \"true to life\".Images are noise free, atleast to my untrained eye. My main problem with newer p&s; cameras is the level of noise & grain in the pictures. I think it has something to do with the high megapixels crammed into a tiny sensor, b/c my first digital camera did not produce that much noise, & it was only 3 megapixels (Fuji Finepix A200). The sensor was even slightly smaller at 1/2.7\" compared to the typical 1/2.3\" sensor in most p&s; today.I am only using full auto mode right now, but I am slowly reading through the entire manual to hopefully learn some things to take even better pictures. But if the pictures never get any better than they are in full auto mode, I will still be pleased having this level of image quality to preserve family memories.I was concerned about not taking as many pictures, b/c it would require toting a large camera around, & I am used to the convenience of p&s; and smartphones. But I bought the smallest bag that would fit my dslr with lens attached. It also holds the charger & usb cord, but that's not necessary. I carry the bag on my shoulder along with my purse, so it's not a problem.I was also concerned about the issue I hear about dust on the sensor. But for now, I'm using the lens that came with the camera & don't plan on changing lenses in the near future (although the Tamron 18-270mm looks interesting & seems it would give the zoom flexibility you get w/point & shoots w/o changing lenses), so I keep the lens attached. From what I understand, this should minimize dust entry into the camera. *Experienced DSLR users, correct me if I'm wrong.*Video was not a must, but I do like having all-in-one for photo & video. It's 720p instead of 1080p. It does not have continual autofocus. I took a short test home video, & this did not seem to be a problem for home videos. I'm not sure about recording a child's school program or something like that.It looks like the Nikon D3100 might be the better entry-level option, atleast looking at specs. It has the auto sensor dust cleaning, 1080p video, & full time video autofocus. It's slightly more expensive, and this Canon was really the most I could spend on a camera.I'm sure I have a lot to learn, but coming from a point & shoot, you will not be dissapointed, if for no other reason than image quality.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Supreme Commander", "ReviewID": "R18PWP6012TDFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good camera.

I'm a Canon girl through and through.Also, comparing it still to the 3100, I find the T3 has sharper, brighter colors especially when you toy around with the \"Creative Auto\" setting and change up some of the settings there. I believe the grip for the 3100 was rubberized and I will admit that it does take a little adjusting to for the non-rubberized grip, but now after using it for almost two months it's just something natural to me and whenever I use my boyfriend's T4i, the rubberized grip just feels weird to me now! The battery life, for me and how I use it, is excellent! I even left the switch \"on\" for a whole weekend by accident after taking pictures all day, and picked it right back up and continued to shoot more pictures.

Vuletich \"sv\"", "ReviewID": "R1F76US40R896E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is likely more than the casual user needs, in fact I think even some professional photographers could do most everything they need to with this camera. About a year and a half ago I saw this camera with the kit lens, a Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras, a Canon Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer PIXMA Pro9000, and a couple of tiffen filters for around $550 after some rebates. I was looking into cameras, and this deal was too good to pass up, so I made first entry into the DSLR market. I have been very impressed with the camera, it takes over 300 pictures on its battery, has good low light performance, and there are a bunch of generic accessories available for the photographer on a budget.The camera itself feels a little unsubstantial. I have held super zoom cameras that seem more sturdy, and the grip is slippery. The auto-focus is also a little slow. These are really only cosmetic issues, sure the body is plastic and not magnesium, thus it has less resistance to the elements, but that will be the case for any camera under a thousand dollars. The sensor works well and there are more adjustments available than you will likely know what to do with.While 12.2 MP seems low it is not really a bad thing to have fewer pixels on an entry level camera. Although pixel technology in sensors have decreased in size incredibly rapidly, the sensors themselves have not improved proportionally. This means that as the number of pixels increase, the amount of light received per pixel decreases and can result in less vibrant images, although they may be more detailed. 12.2 MP is also just not that low of a pixel count. A 1080p HDTV has only 2 MP, and a movie theater has about 8 MP. I think that you'll find 12.2 MP more than adequate.While this camera takes fine pictures, its video performance could be better. The video is limited to a resolution of 720p and 30fps, additionally it has no input for an external microphone. As such this is not the camera for the video enthusiast. the 5d and 7d are some of the best options for video, in fact they have been used in feature films such as The Avengers and Black Swan, However those cameras cost several times as much as this one, so a video shooting option is nice.The screen is fine, It has a fairly high pixel density and is large enough to do see the interface in decent detail. Where this camera and all cameras like it excel is in the ability to zoom into an area on the screen in live view mode and fine tune the focus to razor sharpness.Overall I'm happy with this camera, it takes beautiful pictures, and is a pretty good bargain. While this camera lacks the features of its more expensive siblings, it has more than enough options to satisfy the casual photographer, and might even make a nice backup for the professional.

It is fine for a while, but after a full day of shooting, I find it does become noticeable.2. Camera mode- Very long distance on the dial between the manual modes and the movie mode. Makes spur of the moment movies a little more challenging without missing the beginning of what is going on. I am pleased with the movie quality though.  Put on a lens in manual focus and shallow depth of field and it is quite pleasing.3.  Biggest regret- Wish I got the body only and got a 17-50mm f/2.8 in place of the kit lens.  The kit lens certainly isn't horrible.  I have just come to find that after using my other lenses, it just really lacks low light functionality and seems to really lack the \"pop\" that my other lenses have.  I find the images just look uninspiring no matter how well composed.  The images are sharp.  My complaint is more so based on color and contrast.  Obviously not having a larger aperture is a big part of the issue.Other than these few points, I can't say anything bad about this camera.

The thing that will make any difference in your photos/results is NOT the camera body; its your skills/vision/compositions AND the lenses you have. Save money on body, buy this cheaper unit and use your saving to buy a second lens (the 50mm f1.8 is a MUST HAVE).Now onto why i really like this camera:1. Obviously the price! Espacially when paying more does not get you much more. This is espacially true for people who are looking for their first DSLR. These camera and their accessories WILL get expensive. As i said, the camera body is where you can cut some corners without impacting your end-results much. Buying it during holidays saves you more with deals and packages floating around.2. Battery life: My first DSLR was a Rebel XSi. It was very good but the best part was battery life - outstanding! Later i upgraded to T1i and sold my XSi. The T1i offers higher resolution LCD screen BUT that also causes the battery to drain much faster. This T3 is infact sort of a clone of XSi - same resolution, same kind of LCD and yes, same great battery life!3. Light weight: Its also very light and won't cause any trouble even after a whole day of shooting/wearing this on your neck. If you pair it with a light-weight prime lens like 50mm 1.8 or 35mm 2.0 (i would highly recommend both) - the whole package becomes a light-weight amazing photos machine.4. Easy to use: Perfect for beginners and offers much room to grow/get serious with your stuff. If you are coming from a point-and-shoot, it can act like one where you don't have to worry about any settings at all.This is my 2nd body along with my T1i - notice that i did not call it a \"backup camera\" - it is infact one of my primary camera. I grab either one depending on which one has the lens mounted that i need at the moment.Final note: I was a Canon-guy and Canon was first to bring the affordable DSLR to market so i went with their product. If you are just starting, it might be worth looking at Nikon D3100 as i've heard that is a better entry-level camera.

It was possible to zoom in on her eye in the photo and see me sitting on the floor taking the picture (granted it was quite pixelated at that zoom level, but still...). The settings on the camera are also easier to use than those on my old 12.2 MP Canon point and shoot. I am really happy with how the movies turn out as well.The one and only drawback I have found with this camera is that the auto focus is VERY slow when using the LCD to frame a shot. For this reason, I only use the viewfinder now when taking pictures.

Then after a long research of the DSLR cameras, I came across this model, the Canon EOS Rebel T3. And to be honest, I bought this camera from reading the OTHER reviews, and everyone had stated the same statements that I'm making right now, which is saying that Canon Rebel T3 is a great starter for those people who are starting to get into DSLR cameras. I won't go too much into detail because those are already stated under the description and product overview, but I will say that it's got basic shooting settings, such as close-up, sports mode, portrait mode, regular full shot, etc.For those who are wondering if this camera can record videos: it CAN record videos but it is NOT HD. It's your average quality and I'd compare it to that of a camcorder. It still does record quite well; the video quality is great for a camera that is only meant for picture usage. the built-in sound recorder captures pretty well sounds, without sounding too fuzzy and static-like.As for the lens, it's the standard 18-55mm, which isn't bad. But after awhile, you'll be craving for other better lens, which are just as expensive as the camera, if not more. That is the only \"downer\", I guess you can call it.All in all, it's a great starter camera and if you are looking for a cheap but great(for what it is) DSLR camera, this one is perfect for you.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!!!", "Author": "M.

Most of the shooting modes I had figure out pretty quickly. Putting it on full auto is very helpfull if you just don't feel like manually focussing the lens or turning on the flash and so on. Picture quality is awesome and same for the video. Video was actually one of the main reasons that I chose this SLR over others, because I wanted to get the 75-300mm lens as well. I looked at the Nikon D3100, D3000, the Canon Rebel EOS, the 10 MP models, but for the price and camera features, I found this to be the better deal for me. Going from a point and shoot to this SLR was a smooth transition, I still have my nikon L100, which has awesome image stabilization for video and pics, and the T3's VR is also damn good when using the stock lens that comes with it. But if you record video with the 75-300mm lens, the video will be shaky unless you use tripod or have a very steady hand. Using SD and SDHC cards is also a great convenience, the neck strap is pretty comfortable. I'm still going through the different settings for the modes to get the best picture possible.

Just ask my fans on amazon.I was using the Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens all over Ciudad Juarez for over a year and over ten thousand shots, and we were getting real intuitive with one another and all, and I don't know, maybe it was leaving the battery recharging all night on the surging power sources here (should I throw a voltage regulator in the overnight sack and forget the extra underwear?) or what, but after each shot I would have to flick the switch over and over in order to get her going again, like pumping gas in the old Detroit built automobile until it was flooded again. That got old quick, and it quit in the middle of a couple of projects folks wanted done and I would have to lean on this switch CPR to bring her back to life for just one more shot. Got old fast.So, like instead of upgrading to the Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-inch LCD and 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens, which really remains at 18MP, I had to grab whatver was on the shelf NOW and found this, the T3.Okay, so like I am confused too, over many tihngs, but how come the T2i was 18 MP, and the T3 does not have MORE, you know? Instead the T3 goes DOWN to 12MPbut you know what? For ordinary everyday use and most applications even, nobody will notice the difference.I am still learning to find out where the buttons are now. The review button is in a MORE intuitive spot, but I am not used to that. The Display button is also more easily hit, but I am loving this. It is a lot like running a strpiped back, more convenient T2i, but with fewer buttons and better placed. The center circular buttons around the SET button are ones you will actually use, including ISO, but remember to hit the SET button to activiate the new setting! What I really like is being able to reporgram the Flash button conventiently placed on the tiop near the flash, to ISO, because I am always swapping out into other ISO's. Of course you could do ISO fully Auto up to 6400 (which is the highest ISO on this camera, with no 12800 \"H\" setting) but Auto, what's that? Trust it?And the excellent (what is it, nine?) nine(?) point Automatic focus system is easily reset to the one point you really want to focus on, but ALWAYS remember to set it back, or to the next point you need focus on. How many shots have we lost that way!? Oh. You, none? Me, well, never mind.Yeah, honeymoon's still. For the kind of guerrilla street shooting I do in Ciudad Juarez, this is a great camera, and all I have to worry about are my own fears. Ok, so, can I take a picture of the cops roughing up that guy, or not? Cops make me nervous; I don't know why. I'd much rather do the cute kitties and burros.

Most of the camera publication reviewers were on the fence, not wanting to clearly pick one over the other, the old Canon VS Nikon fight at it's best. This was a big decision for me since my camera taste often exceeds my limited budget, especially now that I'm retired. So not wanting to make a bad investment, I actually tested all 3 cameras and concluded the following: All 3 took great pics, though I slightly favored the color on the Nikon out of the box over the Canon. But the Canon had a much smoother zoom mechanism on the lens and just felt better in my large hands. I also felt the video was better on Canon and easier to use and faster to autofocus. Video was equally important for me as I often switch between the two when shooting my young grandchildren. Considering that I could buy the Canon for $50-$100 less than the Nikons depending on where I bought them,and the fact that all my old EOS Canon lenses from old Canon Rebel XS film SLR would fit the Canon, the choice was ultimately a no brainer. Two years later, my decision has fared me well. Not only have I accumulated two years of fantastic pics that blow away the pictures from my excellent Panasonic Lumix ZS15 pocket point-n-shoot camera , as well as my next stage Panasonic Lumix FZ35 bridge camera (both very highly rated cameras of their type), but thousands of sales by Amazon have verified my enthusiastic recommendation as the Canon T3 is their #1 Best Selling DSLR as of this November 2013 writing. The Nikon D3200 is #3 and the Nikon D3100 is #7 in the Top 10 Amazon Best Sellers list. Another Canon is #2 by the way, which speaks well of the brand, but the arguments of Nikon VS Canon will always continue on a model by model basis. Speaking of that, over the past few years,  both Canon and Nikon have released several new models, each slightly more expensive with slightly more bells and whistles since releasing this entry level model, yet the T3 contiues to dominate sales of all DSLRs on Amazon, not just entry level. You just can't get more proof than that. If you don't believe my opinion, just look at the sales record as it speaks volumes for itself. Incidentally, I discovered a VIVID COLOR setting on the Canon T3, so I was able to match the color that I liked slightly better on the Nikon, so that is no longer an issue.So is the Canon T3 really perfect, worthy of 5 stars? Well, not totally, but there was no way to mark 4.5 stars. My one complaint is that a simple but key feature that Canon puts on almost all of their point and shoot cameras, the quick-shift decicated movie button, is missing from this camera. When I want to switch from stills to movie, as I often do, I have to remove the camera from my eye (I never shoot stills live view off the LCD screen, only movies), view the top selector wheel, and turn it to the movie icon which is as far away as you can get. You lose a lot of time switching over, which means you probably missed that ideal movie of your baby or toddler or pet. Such an easy fix, just a dumb design flaw in my opinion. Also, I don't believe you can shoot a still while simultaneously taking the movie without a hiccup in the movie, as I recall. But this inconvenience is not enough for me to send you to a competing camera as the resulting movie is excellent, even when shown right off the card or copied onto a flash drive inserted in the USB outlet of a 60 inch HDTV. I shoot @ 720p even though 1080p is available as my desktop PC likes downloading and dealing with this HD format better and the quality of the movie is still excellent.Looking ahead, am I so happy that I won't be buying another or upgraded DSLR? Nope. I am a self-admitted camera addict, have been since age 11, so I'm always panting at the new and forthcoming models and dying to try them. I've heard so many rave reviews about the new Nikon D5300 to be released this month (Nov. 2013) that I'm currently saving for one. I've always wanted to own at least one Nikon as I've been a Canon guy forever because it was always the highest rated camera of the type I was buying, but this Nikon D5300 is several steps up with many improvements so I think I'll love it. However, the Nikon D5300 is also about $1200, $800 for the body and $400 for a 18-105mm telephoto lens as I don't want another 18-55mm kit lens like I already have on the Canon. I often wish I could get a little closer and the 105mm should do it.By the way, speaking of lenses, everything you heard about the super value and super performance of the Canon fixed 50mm/1.8 lens is true! I bought one for portraits to get that beautiful background blurr and excellent close-up focus on the subject, and I couldn't be happier. Well worth another $115 or so and great for low-light shots, too.Well, that's my story, two years later with the Canon T3, and I'm sticking to it! I'm also sticking with my trusty \"old\" Canon T3 until I can afford $1200 to step up and see if all the hype and talk and fuss is true on the Nikon D5300. If it isn't signifcantly better than my Canon T3, I will definitely return it, as I always want my money's worth and there's no sense in replacing a sure winner.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor Optical Viewfinder", "Author": "Great Faulkner's Ghost", "ReviewID": "R3TXPBJL38U697", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am not completely happy with this camera, despite the excellent quality of the lens and image quality. I bought an SLR instead of a point and shoot because I wanted to 'see through lens' exactly what I was going to get in the picture. That is what SLRs have always been about for me - what you see is what you get. Not on this camera, nor on most digital SLRs under $1000, I discovered to my dismay. You get roughly 95% of the image, which seems like a lot, but is enough to partly defeat the purpose of owning an SLR. For example, in a portrait shot, where you align the top of the frame about an inch or two above the subjects head, you get this huge area above the head instead -- like maybe 18 inches. So instead, to compensate, you have to guess how much to bring the camera down, which risks cutting off more than you want. Sure, you can just shoot it wider angle and crop it later with adobe, but that's a pain, and I don't want to do my composing in the darkroom. My best work is done in the moment, when I take the photo.  Maybe this does not bother most people, but if you are like me and moved to an slr to get away from the slowness and inaccuracy of point and shoot LCD composition, this camera only gets you part of the way there.

More 'DSLR' than 'entry level'. Let me use my usual disclaimer, and admit that with so many good cameras around, it is more about what mix of traits or features you are looking for.On that note, the camera's trait mix is as follows. It is a DSLR with 12.2 resolution (megapixels). Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is APS-C. That's just one step below 35mm Full frame.It has an optical viewfinder, which works through a pentaprism. That is the classical SLR construction. You are using the properties of light to view the subject before and during the shot. The purists would argue this is the way it was supposed to be- that is, with minimal electronic intervention. The ISO rating is 6,400 which makes it work better in low light. This rating is below many other DSLRs, but you would hardly ever need a higher ISO. Really. The video is a HD- that is 1080x720 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control the exposure  manually. It does have an external flash option. You would need that for portraits, at least. The LCD screen is a slightly smaller 2.7 inch with 230,000 resolution. The sustainable burst rate- for fast action- is 3 frames per second. The camera also does RAW processing which is useful if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. The camera body weighs 495 grams, which is light compared to DSLRs.The T3 lacks a self-cleaning sensor unit for dust. For all interchangeable lens cameras, dust removal has become an issue, because you only need a speck to spoil the picture.

Since then I have shot nearly 4000 photos with it. Are there better cameras? Of course there are but they cost a lot more money. With regard to the quality of photos, I doubt you would be able to actually see the difference between this and a much more expensive camera unless you made an enlargement over 20 X 30 inches.I owned a Minolta SLR, completely manual, from around 1975 till I traded it in for my first digital camera around the late 1990s. I should have kept the SLR longer but I jumped into digital too early and the first camera was expensive and really not very good. My second digital camera was about the same money but much better. The Rebel T3 has met and exceeded my expectations. I truly enjoy every aspect of using it.Really the first thing I noticed was how well this camera fit my hands. I have about average man sized hands and the fit was excellent. This camera is lighter than my nearly 40 year old Minolta because the T3 is made of plastic. Being lighter is a good thing. I don't think the camera looks or feels cheap. One of my friends, when he first saw the camera, thought I must have spent a fortune on it. I like to get all the bang for my buck I can get and that was the principle reason I bought the T3.The rebel T3 does everything I needed a DSLR to do and does it well. When I bought it, I knew it could only shot about 3 shots a second and some cameras can shoot more. I haven't found this to be much of a loss. 3 shots a second is adequate. It doesn't have a built in GPS. My son has this on his Sony camera and says it takes time to locate itself and really doesn't work as advertised. That might have been a feature I would have liked.This camera can take excellent photos up to 6400 ISO. Considering my background in SLR cameras, where the film you used set the ISO and only went to about 800, 6400 allows me to shot in really low light even using the kit lens. By the ways, I found the kit lens very usable and I am able to get great shots with it. I plan to buy the 50 mm f1.8 prime lens in the near future and I am sure it will give me added ability combined with the T3. With regard to ISO, some of my shots at concerts with low and odd lighting have turned out excellent even using an ISO of 6400. Other shots, taken at this same ISO, have had camera noise that diminished them, but they were still usable. Some other cameras have the ability to shoot at higher ISOs and this would be useful, but not really necessary other than in really extreme low light situations.Many DSLRs shoot a larger number than the 12.2 MP the T3 has. More MP is needed only if you want to produce a print that is truly huge or do very severe cropping. Otherwise, 12.2 MP can make an up to 20 X 30 inch print that is excellent. More MP do not make a better picture other than the instances above. They do, however, take up more hard drive space. I can crop a T3 exposure in a severe manner and still have a good 8 X 10\" print.I have taken shots outside when the temperature was below zero, and the camera functioned fine. It could take it as long as I could take it. Using the AEB setting (auto bracketing) I can take 3 different exposures of up to two stops apart in an instant. This is really useful for HDR photography.The T3 is easy to learn even if you don't have an extensive background in ISO, F-stop, and shutter speeds. The best way to learn with any camera is to take many, many shots. If some important shot is coming up, take a couple hundred shots with the T3, to get to know it a little, and you will do well. I've read some reviews that didn't think the T3 took good pictures. It is the photographers fault, not the camera. You have to learn to use enough shutter speed, combined with the right ISO and aperture, and then you can get nearly perfect pictures every time. This camera will help you with that but it still takes practice and a little skill to get it right. Even being an experienced user of an SLR, I still makes mistakes and am continuing to learn. Sometimes I make really dumb mistakes but even making mistakes makes you a better photographer.I have only taken maybe 3 videos with this camera. I didn't buy it to be a video camera. The videos I did take were adequate, not exceptional, and the sound quality was ok but not excellent. Get a good and large capacity sd card to use with the camera. The camera needs a good sd card to do all it can do. The first SD I purchased really didn't cut the mustard because it couldn't keep up with the camera on rapid shots. If you want excellent pictures shoot a large, fine jpeg or RAW or combine the two. Then the large SD card will pay for itself.While I plan to buy extra batteries, this camera can shot hundreds of shots on a single charge. It has a superb battery life.If you purchase a T3, I'll probably see your photos on Flickr. I like to look at the photos taken witha T3.

Most people wouldn't ever notice their images slightly blurred but I know some do.  I replaced my XTi with the T3 after it got stolen after 8 years of wonderful use.  This was for my personal use, not professional so I wasn't looking for anything that delivered like a Canon 5d would.  Let me say that the price is great for this camera.  You can't beat that but after using this camera, it is definitely not worth any more then the $300 I paid for it.The cons:The body has a very cheap feeling to it that I have never felt in a canon camera before (I used to work at a camera store a few years back).  It feels almost like one of those disposable cameras you used to be able to get.  Like not $300 cheap, more like $80 cheap!I have had VERY few sharp images with this camera.  I'm a professional photographer so I know what I'm doing it taking a sharp image.  I used my 17-55mm and my 24-70mm lenses and neither could produce decent results.  These lenses are worth $1000 and $2000 so if anything could get a great image from this camera, they should.  And I'm trying not to be overly picky here but they were very soft images.Pros:Light weightpricecan shoot at much higher ISOs then my XTi.  Its amazing the difference in this little camera.  I can shoot at 3200 without any noticeable noise in a properly exposed photo.  This is far superior to my old XTi.  I had no idea the lower end cameras were advanced enough to do that.  But I would assume that any camera above this (60D, T3i) would be able to deliver this as well.The camera seems to communicate better with my external flash.  I've been getting much better exposure while using my external flash in low light situations.  Once again, I'm sure any model above this would do likewise.As a sum up, if you don't notice the soft focus and don't mind the cheap feeling, go for it.  If you're concerned with those factors, check out the T3i.  Its only $200 more and has a swivel screen.

After about 2 years without a camera, I had decided that I wanted to get back into the world of photography - that's when I had purchased the Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D and its 18-55mm kit lens.Prior to getting the 1100D, I hadn't even considered myself a photographer - but soon I found myself on a journey to learning how to operate the camera in manual, aperture priority and shutter priority. After indulging myself with knowledge in photography, I became a better photographer - and was able to take beautiful pictures using the 1100D. The kit lens is also a great little lens. It is adjustable from 18-55mm and delivers quite sharp images with very little chromatic aberration.The 1100D's menu is quite easy to learn and as you become more knowledgeable in photography - you can adjust the settings to your liking.Just a tip, if you are thinking about getting into photography, don't go for a top of the line camera thinking that by throwing it in automatic, you will get amazing pictures that you can sell for thousands of dollars. Cameras are only tools used to capture an image, and its the skill and creativity of its owner whom makes an amazing photograph.Pros of the T3/1100D:The 1100D does not weigh much and isn't as bulky as the other EOS cameras. Great beginner's camera for the price. Can shoot in RAW and JPEG simultaneously. ISO up to 6400. Comes with a EF-S 18-55mm kit lens which is a great little lens (I'm selling my T3, but keeping the lens!).Cons of the T3/1100D:Battery compartment/memory card combo. I did not mind this until I really started getting into photography. I had decided to purchase a battery grip (which you have the choice of buying a $70 canon grip that is no longer in production, or a generic plastic grip), and if I ever had to change out a SDHC card, I'd had to take off the grip just to do so. The button scheme for making adjustments to the settings is hard to get used to (I usually press \"Q\" and then scroll through the options that I want to change - this takes time and gets in the way of getting a great shot).I give this camera a 4/5 for getting me to where I am now!", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Still can't believe how awesome this camera is!", "Author": "tcgonda", "ReviewID": "R1WVVNAR7OHRFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seriously, this is the best deal!

It replaced a GE Point and Shoot, and a Canon Rebel XSI. I am an armature photographer who specializes in portrait and nature photography. The camera has always been on top of everything I shoot, and the images look stunning in post editing software. Not only does the quality of the images look stunning, but the camera body looks and feels amazing (even though most of the materials used is a durable plastic). This camera is very light, and is a dream during long photo shoots, or outings here in Oregon. Speaking of Oregon (where if you don't like the weather wait for 5 minutes) this camera has remained functional during some light rain. Even though this camera looks like its predecessor XSI, this camera exceeds in terms of shooting capabilities. Both the T3 and XSI have the same 12.2 megapixels and the same operating specs, but the T3 just seems more fluid while shooting. I will go in depth on what was just stated later on in the review. The review begins with the following:-UsabilityPro's: Feels good in hands, never slips out of hands, VERY light!Con's: Matte finish collects smudges, the possibility that this camera may not hold up in a fall (I have yet to find this out)-FunctionalityPro's: Fast shutter speed, stunning low light situations, crammed with megapixels, in camera editing, amazing colors (sunsets look real to life), highly customizablemenu options and settings.Con's: Occasionally the camera freezes OR is slow with processing images*T3 VS. XSI*The T3 as mentioned earlier is almost the same as the XSI but with some minor differences depending on the user. Getting back to the fluidness of the camera that can be traced back to the updated DIG!C processor. Images just seem to come out brighter and clearer (maybe its just me). The XSI however was made out of more metal and rubber which made the build quality better, but much heaver.SummaryIf you are someone who needs functionality and speed from a light weight camera than the T3 is for you. But if you want more megapixels than I would recommend the T3I. Either way the Canon brand has made some very functional friendly cameras, and cost efficient DSLR'S lately.

with depth of field (as opposed to auto point-and-shoots where you have little creative control over shots).- Built-in flash is nice to have, lights well for medium-range shots (but you can't be too close to the subject).- Comes with USB cable and EOS utility software CD that allows you to easily import photos to a PC/Mac.- Comes with battery and charger; battery life is very good.WHAT I DISLIKE:- Sometimes Autofocus does not always work properly, even though its very obvious what the subject should be (this only happens a small percentage of the time, and it's not a huge issue because manual focus is the way to go in my opinion).- I remember that I thought the camera was a bit noisy when you snap a photo - I've since gotten used to it.The one thing I would recommend is to invest in a telephoto lens, you will want to have it so you can zoom in on subjects that are farther away. Amazon often has discounts or offers if you purchase a telephoto lens with the camera. Here's a bundle, this seems to be the best deal currently (but Amazon's prices are always changing): Canon EOS Rebel T3 12.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR and 18-55mm IS II Lens and EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens Bundle", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product and service.", "Author": "ZeldaZucchini", "ReviewID": "RCDGFZIBDY25W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the camera.

However, none of them mentioned anything about their experience with getting the camera repaired. In my case, the auto focus motor in the kit lens failed on the 3rd day I had the camera. I called and Canon and they very quickly got me the information to send the lens back. They repaired it under the warranty and I had it back in six business day from the day Canon received it.

I ended up getting a telephoto lens in addition to the lens in the kit. Totally worth it! I use the telephoto lens more than the kit lens...I feel that the pictures look better with it. Such a great buy for someone just getting started in photography or upgrading from a point-and-shoot camera. Definitely recommend this camera...with the telephoto lens, of course.", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my Canon Rebel!!!", "Author": "CentralCoastGal \"bcnelson5\"", "ReviewID": "R1BAXI55HZ5WN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent weeks looking through Amazon to find a replacement for my point & shoot camera that finally quit working.  I looked specifically for a camera that was under $500 and had quality auto focus abilities, as I do not like to fiddle around with camera settings (because I usually screw them up), rapid fire picture taking so I don't have to wait while photographing the grandkids, superior picture quality, HD video setting, excellent battery life (a must), easy to upload to my computer and was overall reliable.I spent hours reading the comments about a number of cameras, (Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic) but kept coming back to this Canon EOS Rebel T3 because it met all of my above requirements whereas the other cameras for one reason or another (usually not good battery life or slow picture taking), did not.  As a side note, one person who bought this Canon through an Amazon vendor, was not happy with the package condition upon arrival at his home, and he had to return the damaged goods.  The day I decided to purchase this camera, it was actually $5 cheaper and on Prime through a vendor, however, I opted to pay the extra $5 and have it fulfilled and shipped by Amazon (whom I have never had a problem with packaging or customer service).  Package arrived is excellent condition BTW.Anyway, I LOVE this camera!!!!  For me, who is not a camera whiz, it does everything I want or need it to do.  The button functions are easily found, the pictures are superior and the lens fits just about every need I have.  However, I love this camera so much that I will probably spring for another zoom lens to experiment with more photography.  I also purchased the Transcend 16 GB SDHC smart card from Amazon and that works just fine. I will have to purchase another camera case as the lens is a little too big to fit into my modestly sized old point & shoot camera case.I am very glad I purchased this Canon EOS Rebel T3!", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Jessica Kazigian", "ReviewID": "R1VY3KQJQMS8UV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera and love it!

Having had a Canon 20d previously, moving around the menu items meant losing that shot as I fumbled with the layers of menu items.  Not so with the T3.  This camera's menu is very intuitive with very little needing to identify as the on-screen display describes what you are choosing.  I've seen many buy prosumer DSLR's with no camera knowledge thinking they will produce award winning photos only to sell them on the open markets because of the confusing array of camera settings they must remember.  If you're a point and shoot kind of person and wants something a bit more sophisticated than that pocket camera or iPhone camera, maybe a Bridge Camera would suffice.  If however you are looking to experiment a bit with lighting, depth of field or just want to look more professional at your next graduation event, then a DSLR that is easy to use is what you want, and the Canon T3 fits that without straining the wallet too much.Remember, while everyone's shooting with their pocket cameras and you're out there with a nice professional looking setup, they will expect you to produce some really great stuff compared to their's.  If you don't know how to operate your expensive looking DSLR, your photos will make you look like an idiot with crappy pictures.Looking good out there with the T3 and shooting good photos because the camera is easy to use and produces great shots will make you the hero at the next family reunion.Intuitive menu selection, a great variety of lenses to choose from and light-weight, the 12.1 mp Canon T3 will serve you well providing you with creative options as well as the fail-safe point and shoot mode.  I've always believed a camera is only as powerful as the user's ability to use it 100%.  If you don't understand camera lingo, then all those bells and whistles mean nothing, like never taking that Porsche out of 2nd gear.Bottom line, the Canon T3 is well suited for the beginner DSLR camera buff, or old school 35mm manual only camera guys like myself who as we age, simplicity is what we desire.  If you want to graduate to more elaborate DSLR's Canon will get you there with their MKIII series Full Frame cameras, which by the way will use the same Canon lens mounts you will collect as you become more adept at your T3.

Why? Would I really need to be concerned about the megapixels at the highest level. I am currently shooting with a Canon 300D, which goes way back in time, but still takes good pictures. I has a whole 6 megapixels. The Canon T3 gives me TWICE that of what I have currently. The T2i would have given me THREE TIMES the megapixels. I decided that it was not necessary for my standard picture shooting, and was over-kill for my needs. As for the 1080p video, versus the 720p on the T3, that also is fine, as I really do not intend on using the camera for shooting video. For those intending to use this as a primary video taker, they may be interested in the articulating screen that the T3i has.  I have a camcorder, which shoots in HD, @1080p, that fits in my pocket--very portable. As for the screen, on the T2i, which some professionals were all hyped up about, I don't care that the resolution is higher on the screen. I review pictures on my computer, not on the camera. I have also found that I want to see a full sized picture, on my monitor, not a shrunken midget, on a tiny screen. I will occassionally do a quick review of a picture, just to make sure that I got what I wanted in the frame, but that is it. The end result being that the screen on the T3 is just fine for me. Now for the rest of the features, I compared the T3, T3i, and T2i, on the Canon site, and there is otherwise only a fraction of a difference between them. The difference was not enough for me to fell that I would be missing something, by buying the T3. For the extra money that the T2i costs, I bought a 50mm, f/2.5 lens for my new camera (well, I had to chip in a few more bucks! I also had to battle other would-be buyers on Ebay to get it!). I stuck with the Canon line, as having had my 300D for years, it has served me well (and yes, I plan on keeping it, as a back-up). The lens will work on the T3, as they would have also worked on the T2i, or the T3i. Basically the T3 gave me the majority of the features incorporated into the T2i, and T3i, that I actually needed. I was not intereste in spending the extra money for the 'fluff'.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "Paula McDonald", "ReviewID": "RHEJY9ALX22AC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LOVE this camera - pictures are amazing.

Rogers \"Buck\"", "ReviewID": "R1U2G7ZKLEIPC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently decided to get a camera that could take photos of objects that were farther away, as I have an impending vacation where a lot of the views are going to be difficult to capture.  My current point and shoot with digital zoom lens was just not doing what I wanted it to do.  I started looking at Canon Rebel products and settled on the T3 model.  This camera allowed a 'rookie' like me to be able to auto set the camera to get started, and then progress to various settings as I became more familiar with it.  I did purchase the additional 55-250mm lens to go along with the 18-55mm one that came with it.Overall, what helped sell me on this camera?....... the autofocus and stablizer features to start with, then the overall price that I found the camera and lenses here on Amazon.  (No other dealer, either online or locally in Phoenix has since beat the price in their ads).I was also looking for a camera that I could use the live view in the rear screen as well as the viewfinder.  I wear glasses and this sometimes does not make the small viewfinder the easiest to use.  One additional feature I found appealing was the video recording function.  I carry a 16gb SD card for photos, and when I know I will be doing video I have another 16gb SD card to use.One disappointment was the instruction manual....while the included paper manual gave some startup tips, the more in-depth manual is on the included CD and not at all convenient to have available if you need to look up a questioned feature.  I ended up buying a 'Dummies' book that makes the learning curve a lot easier.Overall I am impressed with the feel of the camera in my hands, and the nice quality photos that it takes.

I have an elaborate set-up for the OM/2 gathering dust.  But, having done a lot of photography with the OM/2 I had a set of expectations: The Rebel T3 needed to do the same sort of things that the OM/2 camera system did.First off was evaluation of the lens. The Rebel cameras using the APS-C sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm) have a \"crop factor\" of 1.6 which means you take the focal length of an EF-S type lens times 1.6 to get the equivalent 35mm \"full frame\" focal length.  So the lens that comes with the T3 is 18-55 mm APS-C or ~ 28 to 90 in full frame (36 x 24 mm) 35mm format. Close focus capability is included.  This is an excellent lens to start out with.  The old advice, when purchasing a camera: get and keep the standard lens certainly apples here.  This 18-55 lens is also called the \"Kit\" lens and it is  ideal for every day shooting, including birthday parties and such.In learning Digital Photography I have found the T3 to be a good \"stepping stone\": it includes a number of \"pre sets\": or \"automatic\" modes for portraits, pets, close ups, sports, landscapes, automatic, night and such that let you take the camera out of the box, charge the battery and start taking great pix with only a brief session with the \"getting started\" manual. You do need to learn to charge the battery and install and format the memory card ( be sure to buy one ). And get the lens hood if you shoot out doors. Set the camera on AUTO and go to it!!  You can learn to use the additional features at your own speed, as you need them.The package includes a CD with some *very* good photo editing tools that let you download pix from the camera and then edit your collections.  Great stuff, very useful if you like to Play with Pix on Computer -- as is very popular these days!!Speaking of Playing with Pix on Computer if you are into OnLine sharing, FB, Windows/Live etc you will likely find images in the range of 1024x768 pix are adequate for casual online sharing. Images online do not need to be larger than you can display on-screen.  For this reason the 12 m/px T3 will probably be all that is needed for sharing pix online.  12 m/px is 4272x2848 -- much bigger than you need for on-line sharing!!* The 18 m/px of the T3i would be desirable for higher level work, particularly printing where you will want to change the image to 300 dpi or even to 1200 lines/inch.  But that is another subject entirely; those interested in this area will likely want to start looking at the EOS 60D and possibly settle on a full frame model discussion of which is beyond my level of expertise.  Although it appears to me that improvements in the sensors -- APS-C and now Nikon's CX -- are going to obsolete the old 36x24mm \"full frame\" systems.  \"IMHO\", anyway.  Check out stuff done with the G12 -- using a 1/1.7 (7.6 x 5.7 mm ) sensorLast but not least: the T3 is a great \"stepping stone\" offering \"point and shoot\" or camera control as photographer's choice, and as the EF-S type lenses are compatible through the EOS/Rebel line generally -- a lens that you add for the T3 might be used also on a T3i or 60D that you add later -- which you won't do if you go into a \"high end\" \"point and shoot\".I have already added the EF-S 15-85 IS lens; I'll comment on that, in a month or so.* the Digital Photo Professional software -- included with the camera -- will let you re-size -- and you can even do a whole set of images in a single \"batch\" operation -- after you have your selections to upload.  Although the camera will let you shoot smaller size original images, I wouldn't do that: If you get a good one: you can't go back and say: I want full resolution.  Better to shoot all originals at full resolution.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "RFI0RRNOLSE4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An incredible camera for an affordable price.

Youtube will be your best friend while learning how to use it. Btw, it's going to take time to get used to this camera. There is a lot more that goes into it. Start with semi-auto then work your way thru the dials until you're in manual. From there you can choose how you like to shoot.There are a ton of settings, options, and choices with this camera. It's easy to clean and maintain. It fits nicely in the hand, not too big or too small, and with the standard lens even a tabletop tripod can hold it up.

And I have to say, I really love this camera. I read through the manual and it gave me a good understanding of how to work the camera. I haven't used a lot of the shooting options, I usually stick to full auto or portrait, and the pictures are just fantastic. I guess my only gripe would be the size. I sometimes don't bring it to events that would look great in pictures because I don't want to be lugging around the case and taking the camera out of the case, putting a lens on, taking the lens off, putting it back in the case (I think this also has to do with my worry about damaging the camera or lens in the process).", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy Camera Owner", "Author": "Jan", "ReviewID": "R8IEPA2KWC1I6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my Cannon EOS Rebel T3.I wish the lens would take a closer picture.

The camera itself is more than capable of most anything you'll want it to do. The shooting mode options are similar to those on the canon rebel film SLR, and allow the beginner to transition to manual as they become more comfortable with less-automated shooting modes.When you get the kit, there won't be a memory card included, so make sure you've picked one up (16GB would be the lowest I'd recommend, especially if you're a beginner experimenting by taking the same picture a few different ways, it's nice not to have to worry about filling up the memory card. Also if you're using larger file sizes like RAW, the larger card is a good idea.). Otherwise the kit includes everything you need to get started.The manual is okay, though the pdf it comes with doesn't particularly elaborate on anything in the paper manual. However, the camera itself is pretty easy to figure out , especially for someone who is even a little familiar with SLRs, digital or otherwise.I found the battery life to be excellent, and there's a handy indicator on the screen to let you know when it gets down to half. It seems to charge pretty quickly, a couple of hours at most.The pictures it takes are true to life and look very professional. It's a lot of fun for someone just getting into digital photography or for the hobbyist with some familiarity. I'd strongly recommend picking up a camera bag, you'll find yourself wanting to take this camera with you wherever you go. If you want a little more freedom than the kit lens provides, a good option to consider is an 18-300 lens that will let you get some telephoto capability without sacrificing the ability to grab that picture of your friends sitting next to you.I ordered it here at Amazon, price is really awesome: http://amzn.to/19M6Pf8", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Entry Level SLR", "Author": "laksh", "ReviewID": "R1TZAYK9DT95YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A fine product for those stepping up from point and shoot cameras, the speed of SLR cameras beats almost all point and shoots and lets you get shots which the point and shoot could never get due its slow speed. Dust is not really a problem unless you keep changing lenses often and the lack of inbuilt dust cleaning is not really a deal breaker. Good Image quality even in Jpeg format but requires some post processing in photo editing software.Overall offers the best value for money for those looking for a starting SLR on a modest price, the DPP(Digital Photo Professional) software is very good for entry level users which is included free with the camera.

I had to take a class that required a DSLR camera.  I looked around, and the cheapest ones for purchase at stores in my area were $700-800.  Way more than I wanted to spend.  I bought a Nikon D1 (I later found out this camera was first issued in 1999) for $100 off ebay, and lo and behold, the thing didn't even work anymore. I sent it back to the seller and got a refund.  But, I still needed a camera.  The Canon Rebel T3 was the cheapest one out there, yet Canon is always a reliable brand, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, and so far, everything has been good.  Very easy to set up and meter shots, although the camera is very very picky about focusing, especially when shooting landscapes.  It will not let you take the shot unless everything is as clear as possible.  The Rebel is most definitely less complicated and much more user friendly than almost any other DSLR camera out there, which is definitely good for those like myself who have never used anything other than point-and-shoot cameras prior to purchasing the Rebel.  The price...errrr, maybe it could be a bit lower.  $350-375ish (and not $499) would be appropriate.  I paid $400, which I think was \"fair.\"  I'd recommend it to anyone - seems like a great, and relatively lightweight, camera for someone taking photos while on vacation, where a heavy/bulky DSLR would be inconvenient.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty Handy!!!", "Author": "LUIS ROSAS", "ReviewID": "R3HJHCPYCUS3QZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good and basic camera.

It is a great entry level DSLR with a GREAT price.  I have thoroughly enjoyed shooting with it.Pros- Great photo quality.  ISO is great up to 1600, and acceptable (in my mind) at 3200.- Menu system is easy to navigate.- Good size.  I don't find it to be overly bulky.  I took it with me to a children's museum and I didn't feel like it got in my way (even while chasing the kids around).- Lens selection is great.  I bought the 50mm f/1.8 and LOVE it (Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens).Cons- The plastic body does make it feel a little cheaper than the T3i and other similar models, but I'm willing to deal with that for the lower price.- The LCD feels like it's blurry sometimes, but I think that's mainly due to having a higher pixel density phone screen (I have an iPhone 4S).  You get used to it while shooting, but coming from my phone it takes a while to get used to.- Autofocus for movies is bad.  I get better autofocus performance from my Canon SX130IS P&S.;  I'm not sure if I just haven't figured it out yet, and I'm doing some internet research to see if I'm just missing something.  My main usage is for still photos, so it's not that big of a deal to me.I chose this over the T3i because of the lower price point.

I must say that it is so user friendly!  The brief descriptions on the LCD screen corresponding to each function/setting help tremendously, and after only my 2nd week of using it, I already have a relatively strong command of the major settings of the camera (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.) and can take quite decent manual shots (I hardly ever use the preset functions anymore), all in part due to the user-friendliness of all the functions and settings.  That being said, the presets are actually quite good, especially in daylight or well-lit scenes. In darker scenes, when the settings are manually set right, the quality of photos can be pristine.  This is a very powerful camera, and I do not regret for one instance not paying for the T3i or the T4/T4i, especially with this being my first DSLR.Perhaps one of the only gripes I have about the camera is that it lacks an audio input jack, so I have to depend on the built in mic for the audio in my videos (of course I can just record audio from a separate source and just sync the recording with the video later using editing software).So far, in addition to the camera, I have bought a SanDisk Ultra 16GB SDHC UHS-I Class 10 Memory Card, the PLR Optics High Resolution 3-piece Filter Set (very nice quality lens filters), and the Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW camera case, a very very good buy and highly recommended.  I am looking into buying a monopod now (there is a built in holder for a monopod on the Slingshot case), as well as a remote shutter release.Last point: My brother owns a Nikon D5100, and although he is not a professional photographer by any means, my photos have come out in a quality that has both impressed him and is on equal par with an average photo from his \"higher class\" camera.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love this camera", "Author": "Rowena Chambliss", "ReviewID": "R1FQEKD23CXFG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera for my son and he loves it.

The pictures are great, and while the default settings for the camera make skin look a little odd, changing the light and ISO settings made the pictures look more like I am used to.I understand this product is not marketed to professionals, but I also wish the default wasn't so newbie-centered. It took a bit to get the camera the way I like it, and the automatic settings were pretty much on everything and sometimes got in the way.The video was the only thing I was disappointed with. It's much better than my cheaper $199 video camera, but:* It's hard to focus the video* The microphone picks up the noise turning the camera makes, which means (and I expected this, really) I'll have to record the sound with something else* The microphone distorts some soundAs the book in the packaging says, make sure you have a fast-writing 16G or more SD card if you plan on shooting video. I already possessed these since I do shoot a lot of video, but I thought I'd mention it to anyone interested.For most interested consumers, this camera is perfect.

Focus range on the kit lens is 0.8ft, but you can focus on a subject and then use the zoom to get in closer, giving you a macro like image. Overall very happy with this camera.

The teacher recommended it because it was Canons cheapest model.  Well now I know why.  When I received my T3 I was very excited.  That was on the 7th of January.  I took many(about 40) pictures and all came out stunning.  The T3 DOES take great photos.  My problems arose 20 days later.  Now I don't doubt that the countless people who gave this camera 5 stars had a great time with the T3.  I'm just telling you my experience.  (NOTE:  This is not a review about button layout, \"feel\" of the camera or it's automatic mode.  I am not new to DSLR cameras.)I had put off an assignment for school that was due the next day.  So, I finally mustered up all my will to complete the assignment.  I took out the camera( to make clear, I had not dropped the camera in mud or concrete or sand, or water) and took a picture.  I looked to the display screen to see my photo, only, there was no photo.  But there was a message saying \"err 30 turn off and on replace battery\".  So I did those things and it still came up with the same message.  I went to the internet for any help.  Apparently an err 30 is quite common with the 7D Canon, but not so much with the T3.  It has something to do with the shutter.  One post I read was that the shutter is rated for 18,000 shots or something like that.  I had shot maybe 70 photos before this happened. In short, there is no DIY way to fix this problem.  It has to go to Canon to be fixed.  I would not be so upset if the T3 had a lifetime warranty, but it doesn't, it has only a one year warranty.  So if this happens again a year later, I have to pay to get it fixed when it is Canon's faulty product that is giving me problems.If you buy this product and it works for you, then great.  I used the Canon cameras in high school and never had any problems. I absolutely loved it.  But, if it doesn't, you may regret it, so beware, and buy at your own risk.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice pictures!", "Author": "H\u00e9ctor Perdomo Vel\u00e1zquez \"Thor\"", "ReviewID": "R2W0LLUY6OV638", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first reflex camera and I think I did a good choise.

I honestly couldn't have told the difference between it and a brand new one (which would have been like $90 more). It is quite lightweight, fits beautifully in the hand, and looks all snazzy. It comes with a nice big strap and a few of photo editing software CDs. I've been loving all the options it has, especially compared to my old Canon point-and-shoot - and the more you experiment with it, the more fun you have and the better your pictures come out. My only qualms are that the lens it comes with (18-55mm) doesn't zoom in as far as I'd like, but I guess that's what people buy zoom lenses for, right? :) Another issue I had is that about 2 weeks after I got it I noticed a small spot appearing on all of my pictures, it turned out to be a miniscule speck of dust or something inside the lens that gets magnified onto all of my shots. I know the lens needs to \"breathe\" as you zoom in/out, but I was pretty disappointed since I need to edit this out on almost every shot now. I know I could send it in to get this fixed but I feel like I've spent enough money for a little while :)Overall I'm extremely happy with this camera's capabilities, quick \"reflexes\", and professionalism.~", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good camera", "Author": "Jorge Aguilar Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "RGEN0Q7NNWQJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera are excellent, the battery never discharged in one day of use, and ever take excellent photographies, has many options and a reflex style", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "Adam James \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R1197R88O9ZM1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought it might be hard to use a DSLR camera, but this is VERY EASY to use!!

Higher ISO photos turn out well with minimal pixilation.  I have ended up with some sharp, well lit indoor photos that are the best I have ever taken.  The full auto mode works well in most situations, however trying to broaden my skills and trying other modes. I really like the aperture priority mode when taking portrait type photos of my kids (slightly blurred background really brings out your subject).  The continuous shot mode works well for a camera in this price range. I have also been able to take some nice \"stop action\" shots playing around with the shutter speed.  This kit lens works great, however already looking into a lens that offers a better zoom. In the end the Canon T3 is a great \"starter\" DSLR camera for under $500.

In the 1970's we learned how to remove red eye: Get the flash off the camera.  If the flash is away from the lens the chances of red eye are greatly diminished. This camera has a built in flash, but no sync cord connection for a flash on a bracket. The built in flash works well and gives good pix, but red eye is a problem. Using a flash on a bracket or off camera solves this problem. Without a sync cord connection you can't connect a flash. SOLUTION: A hot shoe adapter can be attached to the hot shoe. The hot shoe adapter has a sync cord connection to attach another flash. Hook up a flash on a bracket, plug it into the sync cord connection and you get great flash photos with no red eye!  Set the camera to M for Manual and set the shutter speed to 1/60 and the aperature to F 5.6.  Set these same settings on an automatic flash and you are in business.  Enjoy!Update: The 1/60, F 5.6 @ 200 ISO. Is not a good balance. The flash is too over powering. I like mostly available light with a little fill in flash. To get a better balance meter the available light and then adjust the flash to provide a little fill in.  It takes a little trial and error to get it right, but once you get it, the results are very good. Another option is to bounce the light off the ceiling for even more difused light.

I did order that off of Amazon but it still hasn't come so I had to settle for the one in my Dad's camcorder for now.  The instructions are alright, skimming through but, for instance, the 'attaching and detaching section' doesn't say how to detach and since I am still new at this, it took me a few minutes to realize what that side button next to the lense was for.I am still really new at this but the live view mode is a really big hassle for me as well.  It is easier just using the view-finder to take the pics instead of seeing them on the screen because it shoots faster.  My newbie ways aren't helping me in that front.Overall though, this camera is fantastic.

Since the warranty on repairs is only six months, it would cost us at least another $200 to have it repaired again. I'm reluctant to pour more money down this drain.

It's decent in low light. Some say don't go above 800 iso but its completely fine at 1600 or 3200. Yes you'll see noise but the picture is still decent and isn't horrible. I use a Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 lens with this and get really nice pictures, though I should have gotten the 17-50 2.8 since this is not a full frame camera. Works really well with a canon 40mm 2.8 pancake lens as well. A lot better than the 18-55 kit lens. The UI is easy to use. Screen is good, viewfinder is good, build quality is nice.This is a great camera if you are someone who wants a camera that's better than a point and shoot but don't see yourself needing something high end.I believe if you see yourself wanting to start photography as a serious hobby though, you'd be better off buying a Rebel T3i body with a 50mm 1.8 or a 40mm 2.8 as a starter cam. You'd only be spending a little more for that combo if you searched the right sites, and you'd get better results with higher resolution and more features.All in all though, it's a great camera for the crowd it's aimed at.

I have used this camera few times and I have never had a complaint. You just have to give it a few minutes and explore the menu, the settings, and try it out on a few random things before you can actually take it out and start using it for events and other activities.Most people probably don't know how to set the camera for certain indoor and outdoor conditions such as darkness, bright lighting, dim lighting, close shots, far shots, landscapes, etc. I think that's the main reason people might complain about this camera.Don't get me wrong, I am no expert when it comes to photography.

I must admit that although the results aren't in the same league with the 5D, I'm blown away with the quality, even with the consumer grade lens.  This is an entry level camera, but Canon has done a remarkable job with it.  However, I must admit it looks a little strange with a 70-200mm L lens on the front!Henrik Hansen, DDS", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "She LOVES it", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R3PLF44EEIGCMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Christmas gift was a big hit.

However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features.  Its the same old technology that has been around for years.  You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots.  The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.

After deciding that our Panasonic point and shoot just wasn't cutting it and deciding to purchase a new camera for our overseas trip, we did quite a bit of research into what camera would suit us. Obviously we weren't looking to take professional shots, but we wanted a camera relatively easy to use that would take clear, bright photos. We settled on this model having read countless positive reviews, knowing it was entry level into the DSLR world, and were looking forward to seeing the difference in picture quality.The noticable difference in this camera is when taking indoor shots, they are infinitely better than a point and shoot in terms of picture clarity. I have so far been disappointed, however, in the outdoor shots it takes. They are no better than my P&S; and the autofocus is terrible, so many of the photos come out soft and focused in the wrong areas. I will need to learn how to manually focus and see if this helps. The landscape setting is also disappointing as most of the photos also come out a little soft.When researching DSLRs it was pointed out that what you see in the viewfinder is ultimately the photo you get. I have not found this at all, quite often the zoom will pop up when I am autofocusing and then not flash when I take a picture? So the photo is much darker than what is in the viewfinder.There is very little zoom on the kit lens, when you are zoomed right in it's the same as if you were looking at the subject with your own eyes. Zooming out allows more to be included in your shot. We did not pay extra for the zoom kit lens and I don't regret it as I fear this may be the same quality as the one we have, even if it is able to zoom in more. As I learn more about DSLRs I may purchase a better quality lens and see if this helps.I must mention that thus far, we have mainly been taking photos on the auto setting while we learn more about the other functions. I do understand that the quality of the shots ultimately relies on the talent of the photographer (or lack thereof!) Perhaps with a bit more knowledge and experience we will see an improvement in our photos. For now, I advise people that you get what you pay for and if you truly want awesome shots you may have to fork out a little more for a better lens (and/or camera body) and photography lessons!", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice functionality but poor quality", "Author": "GameMaker", "ReviewID": "RYFDN3599PPY7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera primarily to use in a claymation class that I was taking.
