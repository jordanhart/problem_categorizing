{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Execution in a Pocket Camera", "Author": "Tom D", "ReviewID": "RN09E9BCJKA4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At the price point of this camera you really should need the ruggedness and waterproof features to justify the expense.  I'll have to update this over time because at this point it hasn't been on the slopes or under water, but it has been in the rain.  I'm not going to try the six foot drop test.  The camera is compact, lighter than I expected and seems to be made like an precision aircraft.  Great looking body.  The display is crisp and bright.  The few pictures I've taken so far, both inside and out, look great, including macros. I'm informally comparing this to a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 (point and shoot, 10X zoom) I've had for a couple of years (best non-SLR I've ever owned).It comes with an optional protective silicone sleeve.This camera has \"O\" ring sealed (and locked) doors for the battery and memory card, and for the data access ports.  These will leak under water if their seals aren't scrupulously clean as described in the factory literature.  So while I'm sure this can be used under water if you're careful, a user will want to be very sure they've carefully examined and cleaned the sealing surfaces before submerging.I've taken photos inside with the flash in a 40' darkened room to compare the flash depth of the older camera with this one, they seem to be the same, so the built in flash is acceptable and typical of this kind of camera; point is no compromise with the flash.This is the camera you can stick in your back pocket and go.  It fits in a SPI belt and fits in a small Amphipod case if you use either of these for running or other exercise.Downside:  So far just two things.  First, there's no viewfinder, not a big issue usually but if you try to wear sunglasses on a bright day using the screen can be problematic.  Second, and potentially more important, there's no protection over the lens, though it's recessed.  It's small and it's one of those things a user will have to watch to be sure it's clean.  Viewing screens seem to mask dust, fingerprints and water spots on a lens, but they show up as an artifact or blur on a computer screen or print.  If you're used to a self covering lens you can get into the habit of ignoring this.  A pop off cover would be nice.Even though this is rugged and waterproof, I'll keep it in a case. Based on descriptions, it's tough to figure out what fits, especially if you want to use the included silicone sleeve which is not included in product dimensions.  The Kroo semi-hard case is a snug fit without the silcone sleeve, too small if you use the sleeve.  The VanGoody neoprene case works even with the sleeve as does the small, but unpadded Amphipod case (which I like for it's water resistance, ballistic nylon construction and belt loop).Update 18 Feb 2012: I should have updated this sooner.  The camera is outstanding.  Now it has been everywhere from skiing in sub-zero, snorkeling, white water rafting, to documenting sludge.  Tough camera, still great pictures.  As expected you have to be sure to keep the lens clean.  White water rafting was the worst because it was impossible to avoid drops of water; a firm shake solved the problem when I remembered to do so.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great waterproof camera for the price & size", "Author": "Dianne E. Arnold", "ReviewID": "R3Q4PJ8A1WUG0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for a trip to the Galapagos because we wanted something light & small for underwater pictures. I had considered a Canon G10 or G11 with the underwater housing and then saw a review of this camera. It is a very fair trade-off for something that is less than half the price and very compact. We got some excellent still photos; the video underwater is OK, but not good enough if you're really interested in getting a lot of sharp u/w video.We used the camera throughout a nearly one-month trip for other stills and videos and are very pleased with the results in daylight or moderate light conditions. The flash is like most small P&S; cameras - useful in limited settings only.We kept the silicone cover on all the time; it protects the edges and access points and provides a non-slip surface making it easier to hold in the hand. When underwater, the silicone cover protects against accidental opening of an access point and is an additional protection against even a drop of water getting in. We tried it out in the kitchen sink before taking it on a trip just to make sure we knew how to use it. We used it to deep-water snorkel many times without any problems. I intend to buy a floating strap for the camera - inexpensive insurance against losing it in the water.I took off one star for the underwater video quality and the flash; otherwise, it's a great little camera and at 14 megapixels, the images (only jpg) have enough resolution so you can do some color tweaking and cropping and still have something that will make a nice 8x10 or bigger.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Second Rate Pictures", "Author": "James Fundeburgh \"JimF\"", "ReviewID": "RZXOKWA0OE04I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was convinced by several of my outdoorsey friends that I needed a weatherproof camera so I bought this on the basis of reviews for a backpacking trip to the canyons of Utah.  I also brought along my old smaller lighter much cheaper Canon 850IS.  I left the Pana hanging around my neck and snapped away- 600 pics in 4 days.  I was pleased with its  very fast response and it kept on ticking even in dirty and wet conditions. When I got home I found the screen had been scratched by the  sand and dust. (So it is only sort of weatherproof)  When I downloaded the pictures,  there were some really good ones but none were the GREAT ones I had planned on.  Most had poor color saturation, strange color balance and were not sharp.  Almost 35% were completely ruined by camera shake (yes I had the IS on).  I had taken a few pictures with the Canon and they were magnificent.  So I sat down at home and did a head to head comparison.  The Canon blew away the Panasonic - no contest whatever. In less than full light the Panasonic consistently takes noisy, undersaturated, fuzzy images. In bright light it still lags in sharpness and saturation.  I think would rather keep my camera in a bag and pull it out for a great picture now and then rather than fill up endless disks with 14MB  crummy ones.  This baby is going back.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is NOT a waterproof camera - AT ALL. NOT MATTER WHAT", "Author": "Kimmy", "ReviewID": "R3MDWXKKTGGOAQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera knowing that other customers had problems with the seals. I was hopefully that if I was extra, extra careful I wouldn't have any problems. NOT! I used the camera underwater 4 times on our trip to Kauai. We went snorkeling - not deep diving.  The camera did fine. Easy to use. Took great pics.  I checked the seals after every trip. Soaked the camera in freshwater after every trip. Followed all the required steps, after every trip. We got home and there was water in the battery chamber. Fortunately, the SD card was not ruined and I was able to download pics. But, the camera no longer functions.Thanks to AMAZON and their awesome customer service team, I will be getting a full refund. I contacted Panasonic customer service. They offered refurb replacement after I paid return shipping. [...] Hello[...] You make a bad product. Why should I be inconvenienced and get a USED camera. Thanks Amazon. This is why I shop with you.So doesn't the camera take decent pics? Yes. Is it easy to use? Yes. Is it waterproof? NO!  And why buy a waterproof camera if it is not waterproof. There are plenty of other great cameras that take better pics but don't sell themselves as waterproof. Now, if you are going to occasionally splash some water on the camera or take it in the rain - it might work fine. Let's be honest though - that is a splash proof camera. If you are going underwater, don't buy this camera. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF.And in hindsight, even if the camera had been waterproof, is it reasonable to expect the consumer to baby the camera with all the required special care? I know people who take less care of their kids while on vacation. A fresh water bath for 10+ minutes after every excursion[...] [...]. I've seen some pretty funky kids running around while on vacation. Clean all the sand and salt out of every crack and crevice after every trip to the beach[...] [...]. I have been home for a week and I'm still finding sand on my body.So in recap - THIS IS NOT A WATERPROOF CAMERA. It is a cool looking, high maintenance camera that MIGHT be splash proof.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "THE PERFECT ACTION CAMERA", "Author": "NeuroSplicer", "ReviewID": "R3USO55KQJ6RFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In brief: if Batman had a camera, this would be it!I was looking for a camera I could take with me to the beach or rafting without ever worrying about it. I wanted something I could drop in a backpack, leave it on the sand and take it in the sea without giving it a second thought. By now I am a satisfied PANASONIC/LUMIX customer, ever since my favorite FZ28K (the most convenient creativity camera) and my trusted TZ8 (the perfect city-tourist camera).So, when, after all the research it came between this camera and the Olympus Stylus Tough-8000, I showed some brand-name loyalty and went with the LUMIX. And the important thing is that I never regretted it.This camera comes with a very bright wide-angle 28mm Leica lens which is optically stabilized, capturing on a 14.1MP sensor and an adequate 4.6x zoom (128mm). Typical for a LUMIX, it has a working intelligent Auto (iA) setting that gives you a piece of mind: perfect photos every time, without having to fidget with the settings.Departing from the auto settings, the camera offers almost 20 shooting modes, 5 color modes, 6 focus modes and decent aperture range (f/3.3 to f/10) and shutter speeds (8 to 1/1300).The camera is Waterproof up to 10m/33ft (which means you can safely take it splashing and snorkeling but not diving without an extra casing). So far, neither condensation nor sand have slipped through the seals.It is also advertised to be Shockproof to drops up to 2m/6.6ft and Freeze-proof -10C (claims I have yet to test - no, I am not putting it in the freezer, it will have to wait 6 months for the slopes to open!).For such a small lens (and such a dense sensor - will the MegaPixel-war ever cease?) there is surprisingly little noise. Given enough light the pictures are flawless. When indoors or with limited light the ISO will increase and so will the noise. I can understand such things to be important to photography enthusiasts but for the purposes I bought it, this is an excellent camera.I don't usually use my photo camera for videos but it is nice to know the option is there. The video (up to 1280x720) can be captured either in AVCHD Lite format or AVI (make sure to have a large enough memory card if saving in AVI). As an added bonus, you can zoom while shooting a video and (almost) no whirring noise registers.My only gripes are that the position of the lens is something I had to get used to (unless I wanted to both include my left hand in the shot and leave smudges on the lens) and that there is no viewfinder. Understandable for a compact camera but having the sun behind you will test the anti-glare capability of the 2.7' LCD.The camera comes in 4 colors: inox-gray, royal-blue, metallic-yellow and safety-orange. I opted for the later out of vanity (it... matches the orange details of my summer watch) - but as an added bonus it is really easy to find even if it has slipped to the bottom of your backpack.An excellent (made in Japan) action camera.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "If you're careful, it kicks butt.", "Author": "Jordan Haff", "ReviewID": "R2DRVF7Z2RGDAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in anticipation of a Caribbean cruise.  I wanted something to capture snorkeling pics, as well as a rugged camera that I didn't have to worry about on the beach or while climbing through a jungle.  This thing was perfect.I should mention that reading reviews of this camera gave me an extreme paranoia about using this thing in water.  Each day before heading out, I would meticulously brush any tiny dust particles and hairs off of the bright orange rubber seals.  Worth mentioning is that the color of the seals provides a good contrast to see if they really are clear of any materials.  That said, I never had a single problem with water intruding into the watertight compartments.  Never did the camera fail on me, and I abused the hell out of it.  I didn't ever go below 10ft of water, so I can't say I tested it to the extremes of its capability, but as far as I'm concerned, this thing is as waterproof as it claims to be.  Now if you're not willing to be meticulous about cleaning those seals, I would not suggest taking this camera in the water.As far as shockproofing, this thing took a beating in stride.  I dropped it on the floor from 4 feet several times while it was on, and it never had an issue.  I had it on the wrist strap while climbing ladders out of the pool and cringed every time it smacked against those metal poles.  Never did I notice any problem with its operation.  I even recorded a video of me holding the camera while diving six feet into the ocean (which I'm sure was a pretty nice shock), which came out very nicely.Now on to my last point, and my only real issue with the camera, picture quality.  The quality on the pictures is passable at best, but what would you expect with such a small aperture?  Pictures looked good on my monitor at 20\" diagonal.  Any zooming past that and it started to look like an oil painting.  I did a lot of messing around with the settings (do not use anything higher than ISO 200, it looks like crap), and found that the issues were simply a limitation of the hardware.  You will not be taking award winning photos with this thing, but it does a good enough job to capture memories in situations you'd normally be afraid to take a camera.A few minor points.  The warning that shows up on the screen every time you start the camera is annoying.  The image stabilization feature is worthless.  The strap feels really flimsy (like the old wiimote straps, though it didn't ever break for me.)  The door latches are really easy to open, so you need to be careful.  And the interface is not the friendliest (though also far from the worst I've seen.)In a few months I'll be doing a snowboarding test with this camera.  I'll try and remember to update the review with those results.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great at first-", "Author": "JKish", "ReviewID": "R3SSVM5THFCYVK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 3 weeks ago. I live in the Bahamas on a remote cay, so I really wanted a camera that didn't involve taking housing on and off throughout my excursions. I bought the Panasonic Lumix TS2 after reading great reviews. It is a nice camera, takes some good shots...as far as any kind of macro underwater it is no good, and action shots underwater are also a lost cause.The reason I am giving this camera such a low rating though, is that after taking EXTREMELY good care of it for the past few weeks...I went to turn my camera on this morning and the screen is all fogged up and the camera is now not working. I was so careful as far as cleaning the \"leak-proof\" seals and rinsing the camera after every use...apparently it didn't matter.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Leaked water due to cheap door seals", "Author": "Ricker", "ReviewID": "RBZM4EGZD14LZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are in the market for a water proof camera then please make sure you do your research and know the risks you take buying this product!This is my second waterproof camera, and after my first one failed on a vacaction, I became super cautious with this one.I took this camera on a snow trip to Switzerland recently and had no problems with it. Was impressed by its video quality, though it did lack in the auto focus department, constantly changing focus.Came back from my holiday and went to the beach with this camera for the second time.Was splashing around in the shallows, taking the camera no more than half a meter underwater. After getting some fun photos. I put the camera back in my bag and when I took it out again to check out my snaps an hour later. After turning it on, noticed that the screen was doing weird electronic \"i'm dying\" kinda things like flickering, and flashing weird electronic lines. So i quickly turned it off, fearing the worst. Opened the battery door and peared inside. And yes, there it was, a couple of very small drops of water on the battery and SD card, and the lipmus paper had changed to purple showing that water had entered.Sure enough after removing the battery and letting the camera dry out for a week or 2. I tested the camera to see if it could be ressurected. NOT a chance in hell! Wouldnt even turn on.So I decided to put my faith in a waterproof camera again. I did so much research this time, and in regards to waterproof cameras this one was supposed to be the best. I'm very annoyed that this camera has failed on its second water exposure. I got to use this camera for all of 3 months and then it was goodbye.For those reading this review looking for sound advice about their decision to purchase. Forget the photographic qualities this camera might exceed in when compared to other waterproof cameras i.e take a moment and disregard all the functions and qualities this camera might exceed in, in regards to the quality of the pictures and the quality of the video etc. If you are purchasing a waterproof camera, for the reason of it being waterproof, make sure your prepared to sacrifice many photographic qualities and find the most rugged designed waterproof camera of the bunch, not the overall winner of all the qualities of a camera.This camera can take some ok to fairly nice pictures out of the water and some nice pictures in the water, but its not a winner in its durability to keep the water out. And lets be honest, thats what this camera is supposed to be about! So i'm a very disappointed customer who has had to waste another hard earned $250 bucks.I have another panasonic camera, and it takes beautiful pictures, so panasonic knows how to do the picture part well. I just dont believe they have built this camera to withstand normal everyday use thats to be expected if this camera is taken in the water. The rubber seals on the casing doors and extremely thin, the hinge and seal mech used to hold the doors closed are small and not strong and its this small area that downfalls what would of been a nice camera otherwise.Be sure to check the range of waterproof cameras and take a good look at their door seals, and their door closing mechs.So can I recommend this product to others?If you telling yourself that you will hardly use this camera in the water, so you still think it'll be a good purchase. Well then.... dont bother buying a waterproof camera, you sacrifice much photographic quality to attain the waterproof status. For the same price on a standard camera, you will get a camera that takes a much sharper, cleaner and well colored picture.If you decide you do indeed want a waterproof camera cause your like me, and are outdoors alot hiking and such, and you want something rugged that you can throw in the pack and such and most importantly use in the water without concern. Well then this review is for you. The camera is rugged, but not in the water. So be wise and learn from someone else who has been there before you, TWICE.Panasonic does not hold their warranty when the water gets in. Do I want this review to be damaging to Panasonic's sales on this camera. Honestly? Yes I do hope this helps to lessen sales for them. But its not for that reason I write it. I too like most intelligent online buyers, use reviews from both everyday users and from the technology reviewers to make decisions when purchasing equipment. So I hope this review will help others to be aware of the main flaw on this camera, which happens to be the most important area, its seals and closing mechanism.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "does it all -best price was amazon's", "Author": "M.W. \"conscious consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R311FL0TI1ATDY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the color size shape and FUNCTION of this camera.

However, fine print in user manual says image stablization does not work for moving sujects --- translation: you have to SIT/STAND STILL and DO NOT PAN for the image stablization to work when you take video!

I bought this mainly for taking video on kayaking outtings, guess what, none of the video footage taken with any kind of boat movement except in extreme flat water has so much hand induced (not boat induced) shaking and it makes the viewer sea sick. It is such a shame that a device made for water sport can not handle day to day real water sport environment... I sincerely hope a firmeare upgrade fixes this problem!Updated 6/1/10:The problem is that small hand shakes are not being removed when the camera is moving along with the boat. I have no problem having the video panning with the boat movement, which gives the viewer the real life feeling of being on a boat. It is the handshakes that are not being removed because the image stablization fails to work when the camera is moving with the boat.

Snorkeling, swimming, etc.(NO jumping in water, that is abuse IMHO...)Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2 14.1 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 4.6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Blue)I've had 4 other (up to 33 ft) underwater cameras and half of them leaked.Olympus was the best about fixing it. NO questions asked. (I bought the Olympus extended warranty and it was worth every penny and they honored it fully.My FujiFilm never leaked enough early on to cause problems.BUT that one made me go BACK TO what professionals do. (NOW it no longer leaks.)(I had a couple REAL underwater models also.)IF you get this one, (the TS2 is the BEST of the lot) get some real diving silicon and LIGHTLY coat the seals AND the surfaces the seals touch.(I use Trident #LP20 Pure Silicon Grease 2 OZ package.)This is what professionals do with *REAL* underwater cameras.(NOTE: LIGHTLY means that you DO NOT put on enough that it picks up dirt, sand, etc. LIGHTLY means you can barely tell it is there...)I can NOT see ANY currently, so I guess I need a new VERY LIGHT application.The seals are VERY small, and need this MORE<???> than the better professional models.I got a truly LIFETIME supply at a Dive Shop in the USVI for $10(US), so protecting a (currently?) $400 camera this way seems like a no-brainer.I NEVER connect this (or any camera) to my computer. I \"card-net\" the pictures with a card reader.That lets me leave the smaller door closed \"forever\". It is harder to clean fully and gets dirty easier near the hinge.EDIT: Got the newer model.Additional: NEVER touch the front glass where the lens is.The coating scratches easily. Some very small sand must havegotten on mine and I should have tried to rinse it off with water.*I dropped the older camera and was unluckyenough to \"ding\" the glass lens cover slightly*......I got the newer model, the TS3 and it is a littlecheaper, one door instead of two (and not as strong a door), but it worksVERY well and has not leaked.

I buy underwater cameras for the main purpose of going underwater & taking photos or video.  First was the Olympus waterproof to 15 feet and the next one was the Olympus 770SW = essentially the same but you can go deeper underwater.  Both of these excelled at being able to fit in a pair of board shorts and looked really sleek.  However, they lacked a LOT.  It had a lot of lag time between shots and the shots were mostly blurry underwater.  The color was off and it wasn't that easy to switch between macro & wide modes.  It was even more difficult to take a video when the opportunity arose.Enough about the Junk of the past,  Let's go over the Lumix.  The Lumix has many advantages to the older Olympus.  It shoots in HD and the pictures are Huge!  It's really easy to use; even underwater, especially due to the iAuto mode which adjusts things for you.  The color sometimes needs some correction after the shot and you can use any digital photo program to fix this, but it gets a bit tedious.  I like that it fits in my pocket and the seal has a lock, so you know it's sealed tight.  It comes w/ instructions on how to keep water from getting inside the camera.  I haven't ever had a camera where the Sunset mode does much of anything, but with this one it works like a charm.  Also it's nice to use the lock focus mode, in where you can lock onto an object in your picture, then move the camera around until you get the framing right.  It's a bit difficult to understand, but when you see it you'll love it.  Oh, last thing I can remember is the flash has an interesting feature of highlighting your shot in the dark w/ a really bright LED light to get the aperture settings correct before you shoot.Overall, it's a step up from what I had before.  Also, it's one of the best reviewed cameras.I give it one less star for the coloring of my pictures being a bit off.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "great camera, bad software", "Author": "T", "ReviewID": "RX07A2S885KG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.  Really easy, great picture and video w/ sound quality.  Leaving it in the auto setting worked really good.  Of course I like more control so I changed the settings many times.  Its easy to make the changes and then back to auto for the no brainer picture taking.  This camera spent a lot of time under water, in the ocean, on the sand, in the middle of waves.  It withstood it all.  Sometimes its a bit difficult to get the tiny fine bits of sand off from around the rubber gaskets.  The silicone cover keeps the finish from getting scratched and gave me extra peace of mind that I or some rogue sea critter won't some how accidentally open the battery door while under water.The play back screen is big and bright.  Its super easy to record movies.  The sound is pretty good too.  It picked up some faint little sounds that I was surprised to hear on playback.The software that it comes with, I don't like.  The editing features are good but its not very easy to use.  Or maybe its just too different from what I usually use.  Good thing that I can use other software that I do like after downloading the pics to my pc.The battery recharges pretty fast.I bought a few accessories to go w/ this camera also.  A floaty strap is important since this camera does not float.  The orange Olympus floaty strap brought my camera back to the surface in both fresh water river and ocean.I also highly recommend buying a good memory card.

I use it sea kayaking, so it's in a saltwater immersion environment. I've been pretty rigorous about rinsing the unit after use. Nevertheless there has been an astonishing amount of corrosion occur in the aluminium case, to the point that I think its days are numbered. I recently went on a six-day kayak trip and a friend who had the same camera, just a few months older, found hers failed due to corrosion on the  button contacts.I have seen several other of these cameras that have had the same problem - two to my personal knowledge that have failed. I don't know whether the users were religious about rinsing them, but I have certainly not experienced this rapid corrosion before.I am scrupulous now about rinsing this but even so I can see that corrosion on the back plate around the control buttons has increased. I'm often on the water for three or four hours so there's no way I can keep it away from salt water in that period. A chemistry professor friend speculates that there are manufacturing options that could limit the electrical reactivity of the aluminium case but choosing to use an aluminium case in a saltwater environment is always going to be dodgy because of the intrinsic highly reactive nature of the metal. It's not as if you can attach a sacrifical anode!All in all, I was very pleased with the image quality and ease of use once I got rid of the nag screen, but the exterior case means I can't regard it as fit for purpose. It may satisfy some standards criteria but the exterior case corrosion means it's not  a great option out in the real world.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good, portable, underwater camera", "Author": "MTV", "ReviewID": "RFDVPIK8PJEZ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I, like many of you, researched cameras that could be brought in the water and could withstand the rigors of frequent and sometimes violent travel.  After much debate, I selected the Panasonic Lumix TS2 based on the picture quality and the ability to go 30+ feet underwater for shallow dives.  I really didn't want a huge camera that would effect my underwater mobility.  Other cameras in this class could only go under 10ft, which is fine for snorkeling, but not for diving.I took the camera on a test run to Mexico and took it snorkeling first, then diving to 30ft twice (salt water).  I was able to take very good photos and the HD videos turned out great.  To finally be able to share videos in HD of diving with my friends and family was really a neat experience.  The microphone worked underwater as well and the water sounds added a funny, if unnecessary, twist.I have read a few reviews about other folks losing their TS2 to water damage and I was very careful when closing the battery/memory card case.  A brush is included to help clean out the compartment as even grains of sand can lead to water entry.  The camera has had no problems in water.  I checked my diving gauge and (hesitantly) brought the camera to exactly 30ft deep.  I maintained this depth twice on two separate dives for 15 minutes each time with no problems.Battery life and memory card space are directly dependent on how much HD video you take.  For just photos, the battery life is normal to above average.The photo quality is very good but not fantastic.  Comparing this to an SLR is unfair, however the macro and still photos were good. It was difficult to get the elusive sea life while in motion in low light, however in full light the photos were very good. The flash, although not very bright, worked underwater for macro shots and helps with capturing the color of some coral.I'm not a diving pro, maybe 3-4 times a year, and I am an average to above average photgrapher.

Found the camera overall pretty easy to use, I didn't dive into some of the more specific technical settings, but found it to be pretty easy to use without the manual. (to get the full manual you have to print a pdf file from a provided disc, seems a little cheap but more and more companies are doing this) Underwater this camera worked great, I lived in the water with this thing, hours at a time in the ocean and pool, and also took it snorkeling. I followed the care instructions for the seals, always washed my hands before sealing to ensure I had no lotions or grease on my hands and never had an issue with water. I had been a little worried after reading some reviews of people's problems in the water, but I have to believe those seals were defective or the users were careless because I had this thing underwater hours each day for a week without a single issue. Picture quality seems good, prob can buy a camera around the same price that takes a little better pics, but not with the overall ruggedness and underwater capabilities of this.

I did my research and like many have said it came down to the Panasonic and Canon and I chose the Panasonic because it was more portable and also because I currently love recording video of the family in HD using my sony camcorder that uses AVCHD which this Pansonic does too.I recently got to test this camera out on a family trip to the Maldives. Took this camera out snorkeling and to the pool over a half dozen times and had it rolling around in the sand with me and the kids. I took some pictures which came out good but my wife also brought along our Canon SD1000 whose pictures were extremely comparable. The pictures on the canon are probably actually slightly better in my opinion except that it can't take underwater pictures of the kids or the fish (unless I got a shell which I find too bulky to lug around). The true value was the video which was awesome. Now, it is not easy to record video underwater while snorkeling because glare off the screen was tough to get used to underwater, but once I adapted I have great footage of parrot fish, angel fish and even black tipped reef sharks that swim up to you. I have my son and wife pointing out at the coral and schools of fish swimming up to them. Truly once in a lifetime and this camera performed.Once we got back home from vacation, it snowed and with the kids, we went out for a good old snow ball fight which this camera recorded and even took a nice direct hit.So in summary, the pictures on this camera are OK and the video is great. The ruggedness and waterproof is what you want and this passes with flying color (even took a big licking on coral and came away with minor scratches). Also this was very portable and only slightly noticeably bigger than our Canon SD1000. It fit easily in my pocket and I took it everywhere. These are the reasons I bought it and it was definitely money well spend.

Provencher \"ppro\"", "ReviewID": "R23W6PM6B49G7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, I stole the review title, but the phrase really fits.  Here's why:I have a heavy, prosumer-grade DSLR that makes incredible images.  I love to use it and for the first year and a half of ownership, carried it everywhere along with a tripod, a monopod, four lenses, charger, extra batteries, and all the little gadgets that go with it.  Almost 30 pounds of gear in a purpose-built backpack.  And I have made some very pleasing images.And then my sons started having outdoor activities involving hiking, camping, water, and ice.  As I like to be in the outdoors, I naturally participated and brought my \"pack of lead\" with me.  Well that was fine for the trips where the weather was nice and I didn't need to carry anything but my camera gear.  But at the end of the day, I was whipped and I had to be concerned with securing my DSLR kit so it would not get wet, cold or in some other way damaged.  Then came the multi-day hikes and activities like Cross-Country skiing...It was clear to me (what took so long you must be saying?) that this was not going to work.  I went on one hike with no camera and spent the whole trip feeling that I was missing photo-opportunities.  It's just the way I am wired.  I have been recording my kids outdoor activities for their entire lives and this left a gap.  I tried to revert to my previous digital camera but it was a bit large and also vunerable to the elements, and a bit dated from the technology point-of-view.  I needed to get a camera that was going to be small, rugged, and capable of producing better than average images.Which brings me to the Lumix DMC-TS2.  I looked at the variety of cameras in this class (waterproof, \"drop-proof\", freeze-proof, dust-proof) and found that from the choices offered by Canon, Pentax, Fuji, Olympus, and Panasonic, only the Canon and Panasonic had image quality that would rise to the level I needed.  The others are fine cameras and produce good images, but I wanted to get the best image quality possible and have a camera that would withstand some abuse.Comparing the Canon D10 to the Lumix DMC-TS2, I found the Canon to be larger, though just as well qualified to produce great images.  In fact my inclination was to go for the Canon but the size was the determining factor.  The Lumix just fits better in the pocket and on my backpack belt.  The image quality (according to numerous reviews) is a toss-up, so there it was - choice made.In actual practice this camera is quite good, though you will need to spend considerable time with the advanced owners guide to get the most from the camera.  If you just want to point-and-shoot, the camera has a terrific setting for this, along with some basic \"scene\" presets (snow, beach, underwater, portrait, etc.) that in my experience produce some great pictures.The memory card this camera uses offers storage from a couple giga-bytes to 64 GB.  At 64GB you are paying more for the memory than the camera, but you have a bottomless store for pictures - great if you plan to be on a multi-week outing with no computer access.Which brings me to batteries.  With my DSLR, I use a two-battery grip that gives me about 1000 images between charges.  Panasonic rate these batteries to give about 300 images per charge.  Consequently I recommend, as I have done, to get two or three batteries if you expect to be away from a power source for a few days.  The batteries fit well into any number of small belt-sized camera cases that you may wish to purchase for carrying the camera.The best results I have gotten with this camera to date are sunsets, morning skies, some people shots, and landscapes in general.  There are also some great portrait settings that I just starting to explore with good results.I don't plan to go diving, but am happy that the camera will tolerate it.  I don't plan to drop the camera but it's nice to know this camera will survive small bobbles.  I spent a lot of time outside in bad weather and cold so feel good that this camera is made to do that.  This gives me the solution to that heavy DSLR kit that cannot coexist with outdoor activities.The best camera (for me) is the one I have with me...Here's what I pulled together for my \"light-weight expedition kit\"Professional Mini Ball Head Camera MountRemington Multi Functional Shooter's RestLowepro Ridge 30 Camera Case (Black)Sony LCSCSQ Soft Carrying Case for Sony T, W, and N Series Digital Cameras (Black)Plano 10137 Gun Guard SE Single Scoped Pistol Case", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, Easy for my 12-yearold son to use", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R2NQ9D6E7TWMRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All seems fine with this new camera.

One of the main reasons for purchasing the Lumix DMC-TS1 was the \"waterproof\" camera itself.  I thought in the seemingly rare case that  the marine housing were to leak  the camera itself would be \"waterproof\".  I thought I had a good back up plan.  However on a shore dive (only the third vacation of using the Panasonic camera and housing), the housing leaked allowing water in the case.  The shore dive was fairly shallow, no greater than 30 feet.When I returned to the resort from the dive, I quickly removed the camera from the housing that was 1/2 full of water.  I rinsed the camera off with tap water to rid the salt water.  I let the camera air out for 24 hours before reassessing.  I expected the camera to turn on, when it failed to turn on I was shocked.  This is the first time the camera ever came in contact with water and it was while it was in the marine housing.  My brother has a Canon that accidently got wet when his housing leaked and it still works, and it is not advertised as being a \"waterproof\" camera. So I have two failed pieces of equipment from Panasonic each costing over $200 dollars.  It happens to be 3 weeks over the year warranty .  I have the wonderful opportunity of mailing in the defective equipment ( at my cost) and for $45 I can have their technician look at it.  After it has been assessed , a repair fee will be given and thankfully I can apply the $45 dollars to the repair fee.I  have a Sealife camera and marine casing that has never leaked over the years of use.

It all arrived quickly and I took a few pictures before the trip just to make sure everything worked fine, which it did. The 2nd day in Kauai we went on a snorkling tour and the camera worked perfectly. I only took it down to about 12 or 15 feet, but I had no trouble. I took about 150 pictures at full resolution without running out of charge on the battery. Other people have complained about this model camera leaking, and I think that is because they were not meticulous about making sure the rubber gaskets on the 2 covers were free of any sand, hair or dirt. After using it in the ocean, I followed the directions and soaked it in fresh water for ~10 minutes. I put it in a glass bowl, and swished it around. When I emptied the bowl, there was quite a bit of fine sand/silt that came out of the crevices in the camera. I let it drain on a towel for a bit before I opened it up to keep any water from getting in. When I opened the battery/memory cover, there was still some sand/silt around the gasket area, so I used the included brush to make sure it was all clean before I closed it up. It helps if you have some good lighting when you're doing this. Although the water wasn't perfectly clear because of recent heavy rains, I still got some great shots while swimming with Green Sea Turtles. Out of the water the camera worked well too, with the smart mode knowing the diference between shots of people, landscapes and clouds.

This problem is exacerbated somewhat by the relatively small built in flash.The other major quality gripe I have is the resolution. The optics of this camera are not even close to resolving 14 MP. Zoom in on any pic from this camera, and you will see blur long before you see pixels. Think of this camera as closer to 8MP maybe, or less even.Beyond the quality issues the functionality of this camera is great. The 5x optical zoom is plenty for a pocket camera like this, and zooming during video is nice.The camera boots up in about a second, and can take pretty quick shots; this makes it great catching unexpected pictures. Plus, there is no telescoping lens or lens cap to wait far. It is literally 3 seconds between having the camera in your pocket and taking a picture.Being water proof and rugged is a major plus. I've taken lots of underwater shots with it; there is less light available underwater, which can be an issue, but otherwise it works great.This camera does a good job of being there when you need it, and getting the shot you want in time.

I wanted to be able to take it on the boat when we went out snorkeling. We got some great shots of the kids snorkeling and I got a fabulous shot of a spinner dolphin. We also took pictures of the kids in the pool at the resort. It was nice to have a camera to take and not worry that it would get splashed or get sand in it at the beach. I didn't have any trouble with the camera leaking. I was careful to only open it to change the battery or copy pictures when I was safely back in the hotel room. This camera was taken down maybe 10 feet or so while out snorkeling. I was pleased with the picture quality. I would highly recommend this camera for worry free vacation use. The kids also had a great time using this camera in the pool to take pictures of each other under the water.The only real negative I had with this camera is that it was almost impossible to see the LCD screen while under water in the daytime. And, since it doesn't have a different viewfinder, it was a little bit of point the camera and hope it was capturing what I wanted. However, as long as I wasn't trying to zoom in on an object, the pictures all came out really well. I think with more practice I will be able to zoom in also.As a side note, I also ordered an orange floating wriststrap for the camera. I wanted it to float in case dropped overboard or in the pool.

I really thought Panasonic would do a better job designing and building a product with these features.  Camera is large and heavy and picture quality isn't very good, which is what I expected, but I bought it since it was supposedly waterproof.  Well, it isn't.  First trip with this camera, second day on the pool and it stopped working. I did absolutely everything the manual instructed but water got inside anyways.  Problem seems to be a leakage from the picture mode dial, so it shouldn't be my fault.  This is really a second or third camera for most people since it is heavy and doesn't take stunning pictures so it will never be your number one camera if you favor size (good compact will be your choice) or image quality (SLR will be the one picked).  The reason to get this, and really why I bought it, was for its waterproof feature.  Since waterproof is a misstatement, takes away the reason for owning it.  I strongly recommend anyone thinking about this to avoid it at all cost, unless you typically drop your electronic products.  I haven't dropped it either to be sure the toughness as described in the product overview is accurate, but to be honest from the feel of the camera and from its weight I really don't believe it will resist a 2 meter drop.

I went with the Lumix because of the size, and I was not disappointed. We took it with us on a trip to Costa Rica and really put it through everything.  We took it on boat trips, snorkelled with it, took video while being buffeted and splashed on a Wave Runner riding around the coast, took pics of surfers while in the water with waves crashing on top of us and used it on the beach during windy sandy conditions.  The snorkeling pictures were not great, so I decided to put it in video mode instead, and WOW!  The underwater video is fantastic.  I realize now it is much easier to capture the magic of what you are seeing underwater with video than with still pics (it is almost impossible to get those fish to cooperate). The day was cloudy, and the underwater video actually looks brighter than it was.  Video out of the water was great, too.  I have National Geographic quality video of the Howler Monkeys that visited us in the trees where we were staying.  And the out-of-water pictures are great, too - no disappointments there.  I am not a very knowledgeable photographer, just use the auto settings. I rarely needed any flash, the camera takes great pics in low light.  A note about the silicone case that comes with the camera, I read in many other reviews that the users didn't bother with it, but I loved it.  Once on, it protects the camera from getting all scratched up, buffers it a bit if you drop it, but most importantly, it makes it impossible for you to accidentally open the battery or card access while underwater.  That is the only weak point in the system - I can see how the latches for those access compartments could be nudged into the unlocked position if you weren't paying attention. Not possible with the cover on.  So, so far no complaints about this camera.
