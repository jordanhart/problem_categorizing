{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic Camera, Bad Quality Control by Nikon", "Author": "J. Pivkova", "ReviewID": "R3P6WDD5E8ICRH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "WHO IS THIS CAMERA FOR?1.) More advanced photographers moving from DX/crop format to full frame (assuming they already own FX glass or plan to buy at least a couple FX lenses with the D600.)2.) Photographers who want a second body to accompany their pro body as back-up.3.) Nikon D300, D300s and D700 users who want better ISO performance, much better resolution and dynamic range and won't miss a couple of the pro features of the D300, D300s and D700.4.) Patient beginners with very deep pockets who understand it's going to take more than \"Auto\" mode to create beautiful photos. Open yourself up to RAW.WHO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO:1.) Beginners with no $$$$. You're gonna need money. Lots of money. Good full frame lenses are expensive. Forget the kit lens that comes with the D600. You're going to need something better to make this camera really shine. EDIT: A few people mentioned in the comments that the kit lens is fine for beginners. Yes, the kit lens is fine for beginners who are just getting started and don't know what they're looking for, however the kit lens can be quite expensive for what it is. In my opinion there are better, sharper, faster lenses out there for that price even if they are not as flexible as this slower zoom lens. Some people may be perfectly happy with the kit lens, but eventually you will want something better and that will most likely cost you lots of money.2.) People who only want to shoot JPEGs. Yeah... you can shoot beautiful JPEGs with it, but that too requires adjusting settings. JPEGs can be unforgiving as opposed to RAW. Some might really disagree with me on this point, but I've known too many people who bought DSLRs and were surprised when the camera was taking unsatisfactory pictures. It's not the camera, it's the user!3.) DX/crop sensor photographers who don't own any FX glass. Get yourself FX lenses first. No matter how much you're tempted, it makes much more sense. Trust me.4.) Anyone expecting $3,000 + features for $2,100.00.SHOULD YOU BUY THE D600 or the D800???Depends on what you're shooting, why you're shooting it and how much money you have.D800 = Pro 51 AF point module vs. 39 AF points - slightly more accurate/faster focus and a tad more viewfinder coverageD800 = 36 megapixels vs. 24 megapixels - slightly more resolutionD800 = Up to 9 consecutive shots for HDR vs. 3 consecutive shots - better HDRD800 = Shutter life of 200,000 vs 150,000 - longer life spanD800 = Teeny tiny bit more dynamic rangeD800 = 1/250 flash sync speed vs. 1/200D600 = 5.5 FPS vs 4 FPS - better for sports and wildlifeD600 = Lighter and less pixel density - easier to shoot hand-held with slower shutter speeds (Good for nightime and daytime photography. Less chance of camera shake/motion blurr)and easier to carry during long hikes.D600 = Just a teeny tiny tad better at high ISO in low lightD600 = $1,000 lessD600 = Smaller file sizes, which means easier file handling.There are a few more differences, but both cameras will give you incredible results, both cameras have insane high dynamic range and resolution, and both produce beautiful RAW and JPEG files. If you're a serious amateur, the D600 is plenty of camera for you. If you're a beginner, the D800 may be too much camera to start with. By the time you learn the ropes with the D800 (which may take years), the next best thing will be on the market, and you would have wasted $3,000.00 on a camera which you were able to use only 50% of its potential before you trade it in (then again if you're not the type who must upgrade as soon as something new is on the market, the camera will keep you busy for years). For beginners even the D600 may be a bit too much. Pro landscapes could do just fine with the D600, but may appreciate the 12 more megapixels and 9 shot bracketing (for HDR) when they're printing large posters. Wildlife photographers may appreciate the faster FPS, slightly better ISO performance and lighter body of the D600. In my opinion the D800 is more of a tripod camera while the D600 is more of a hand-held camera. If you're still not sure, rent them both and decide that way.I WANT TO START OFF WITH THE POSITIVES:I absolutely LOVE my new D600. I moved up from a D7000. Although I like the D7000 a lot, the D600 is even better in many ways.1.) It has incredible high ISO performance2.) Sharp, accurate and fast to focus (much better than the D7000) even in dim light3.) Incredible resolution at 24 megapixels4.) Very high dynamic range and the color reproduction is beautiful5.) Fairly light compared to other Nikon pro bodies6.) 5.5 frames per second which is slightly less than the D7000 6 frames per second, but the D600 has a larger buffer.7.) Auto-ISO feature is very helpful.The list goes on.....As far as use and picture quality goes, this camera blows away anything within the same price range, and even some of the slightly older pro bodies that still go for well over $3,000.00. DXO Mark rates this camera as #3 on it's list, and the only cameras listed above it are the Nikon D800 and Nikon D800E. Believe it or not, the D600 sensor scored higher than the D3s, D4, D700 and all the current (2012) bodies in the Canon line-up. Obviously the D600 lacks some pro features like faster frames per second, an even bigger buffer, a couple of nice easy-setting-access buttons and full magnesium body, but let's face it; If Nikon had put all the good pro-features into the D600, why would anyone in their right mind pay $6,000.00 for a pro body? The D600 is purposely held back in some aspects by Nikon, but this does not mean that great performance and incredible image quality were sacrificed. In my opinion the price (at this time) can't be beat for what you're getting in return.Contrary to what some believe, the D600 is not a repackaged D7000. It shares some features with the D7000, but it also shares some features with the D800. It's the best of both worlds. It is slightly bigger and heavier than the D7000, and slightly smaller and lighter than the D800. The body design in the front resembles that of the D7000, and the back of the body resembles the D800. Some have commented that the body feels cheap in their hands. I don't understand this sentiment. I guess some people feel that the heavier something is, the more expensive it feels. I can see why someone who has handled a D4 or D800 might say that, but in my opinion the D600 feels just fine. It has slightly better build than the D7000, and the D7000 is solid. I hear this mostly from people who have never taken their \"pro\" bodies outside the city. They need all this ruggedness, but they never use it. I've put my D7000 through a lot of abuse in the rain, snow, heat, climbed old castle ruins with it,...even dodged unruly kids, beer and drunks in bars and there's not a scratch on it. Do some of these people plan on dribbling their cameras? I keep mine on a neck strap, protecting my lenses. I think the D600 will be just fine.NOW TO THE NEGATIVES:Nikon's quality control is suffering greatly, and it's the only reason I'm rating the camera at four stars. It hurts me to do so, but I have to. I don't know if this is common with a lot of camera brands, but out of the four DSLRs I've owned, this is my second Nikon camera in a row suffering some kind of defect. Everything is absolutely perfect about it except the fact that it came with dust/oil spots on the sensor straight out of the box. I didn't notice this at first, but when I was shooting a fairly featureless subject stopped down, I noticed many small round spots concentrated mainly around the top left corner of the photo. These spots can be found all over the picture, but most of them are up in that corner. This is by far not as much of a concern for me as my D7000 back/front focusing issue was, because at least I can clean my own sensor. However it is disappointing to find something like this. It affects picture quality. I have done my best to remove these spots from photos in Lightroom 4, but at some point it becomes a chore. I have contacted Nikon about it and they want me to send it in. Since I love the camera so much, I don't want to be without it for a week or two, but if I don't get this issue resolved, maybe it will make me more upset in the long run. I will update the review once it's fixed.WHAT ACCESSORIES TO BUY WITH THE D600This is purely my opinion, but you may want to consider buying the following either directly with the D600, or a sometime after you purchase the D600:1.) Make sure you buy a good-quality FX lens to go with the D600. Choose the lens based on what you like to photograph most. There are many specialized lenses out there such as wide angle, macro and telephoto. There are zoom lenses and prime lenses. Most pros already know that a well-rounded Nikkor lens line-up to own is the 14-24mm f/2.8, 24-70mm f/2.8 and the 70-200mm f/2.8 VR I. or VR II. There's also many great, fast prime lenses to choose from (cheaper options being the 50mm f/1.4G or f/1.8). I know of no lens that is good at everything, so you'll be making sacrifices no matter which one you choose. There are cheaper third-party options out there such as Sigma and Tamron. I myself prefer Sigma if I'm buying third-party. I've had a couple of Sigma lenses, and in fact one of my favorite lenses is the Sigma 150mm f/2.8 macro. I've used it for macro, birding, as well as portraits. It is super sharp and definitely rivals Nikon's 105mm macro lens in sharpness. Basically choose your first lenses based on what you will photograph most, and later on add more specialized lenses to your collection.2.) A fast SD card, preferably nothing slower than 45MB/s. write/read speed and at least 16GB such as the SanDisk Extreme Flash memory card (maybe 2 of them), or even better, the 16GB or 32GB 95MB/s SanDisk Extreme Pro Flash memory card. Anything slower than that and you will find the buffer not clearing fast enough when you're shooting in burst mode.3.) A good photo-editing program such as Lightroom 4, Photoshop CS6/Adobe Camera RAW. I personally use Lightroom 4 for all my photo editing, but some people prefer Adobe Camera RAW and Photoshop. If you're not shooting RAW with the D600, you're wasting a lot of its potential. RAW files hold the most information and give you greater dynamic range. Consider the program your developing room. The camera records the information and you develop that information into what you saw or what you wanted to see in the scene when you were shooting. If you're shooting JPEG only, the camera saves only very limited amounts of information. JPEGs also lose quality every time you re-save them, whereas RAW never loses quality and can be modified as many times as you want. It can also be reset to it's original form. RAW is the only way I shoot.4.) If you have big hands, you may want to consider picking up the MB-D14 battery grip to give the D600 a little more size and better balance. It's also very handy for extended battery life and vertical shooting. There are cheaper third-party battery grips out there, but the quality is lacking and you risk possible damage to your camera. Many people are very satisfied with the cheaper third-party grip options, but I personally would not risk it with an expensive camera.5.) Second battery. If you already own a D7000 and you plan on keeping it, the good news is that the D600 and D7000 share the same battery. I use my D7000 battery as a spare. Of course if I decide to use both cameras at the same time, this could be a problem. You can get a lot of shots out of the D600 battery on one charge, but it's always nice to have back-up. If you buy the battery grip, you can use regular AA batteries in the grip.6.) A good sensor and lens cleaning kit. I would recommend at least getting a blower. I bought the Giottos Rocket Air Blaster and that seems to work nice. Other people use things like the Visible Dust Arctic Butterfly, but that's fairly pricey. I guess you get what you pay for. You can always get your sensor cleaned by a camera shop, but they'll charge you anywhere from $40 to $60 each time you bring it in. There's the security in knowing you got it done right, but that can add up to a lot of money down the line. If you don't feel confident enough to clean your own sensor, you're better off having it done by a professional.... however... it is nice to learn to do it yourself. I learned to clean mine on one of my older DSLRs for practice. It's easier than you'd think, but I'm not going to push you if you don't feel good about it.7.) A camera sling strap like one of the Black Rapid straps or a Carry Speed FS-Pro strap. These attach to the tripod screw mount on the bottom of the camera and you can wear it over your shoulder with the camera and lens swinging next to your hip. You would really appreciate this carry method on longer hikes. or just walking around in general. The Carry Speed FS-Pro strap for example is very rugged and sturdy. The shoulder pad is wide and stretchy. It makes you feel like you're not carrying any weight at all. Neck straps are O.K. for lighter point and shoots, but if you want to save your neck some hardship, you'll look into getting a sling strap instead. It's easy to use, the camera is out of your way when you don't need it, and it's right there when you do.UPDATE:I have sent my D600 to Nikon service for the dust issue. They serviced the camera within one week. After I got it back, the sensor was spotless until I took about 600 shots with one lens (a prime, not a zoom) attached the entire time. After considering sending it back again, I decided to buy a sensor cleaning kit instead and cleaned it myself twice. After these two cleanings the spots are not coming back (at least none that I can see). Between shoots I use a Giotto blower to make sure I get rid of any possible spots. So far so good!CONCLUSION:I would highly recommend this camera to the category of people I listed at the very top, but I would also recommend caution as far as these dust/oil spots go. Not everybody has had this problem, but there are a number of people who are experiencing it. I'm one of the lucky few. Fact of life is that you're taking a risk no matter what manufacturer you choose. Nikon has had it's issues and so has Canon. The only thing we can do is hammer these companies with complaints and demand justice.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera with FATAL FLAW!", "Author": "R. Thompson \"sixseven\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZTLV8ZYI176T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has a fatal flaw that is affecting a large number of D600s.  Specifically, the camera mechanism that raises the mirror during exposure is flinging lubricant onto the sensor.  This is completely unacceptable -- for more about this go to: [...]Because of this, you get very distinct spotting on your images.  The website referenced about mentions that Lensrentals.com had to clean 100% of their D600 bodies to fix the problem.For the record, I have three other pro-grade Nikon DSLRs, and 20+ Nikon lenses, and have shot only Nikon for 35 years.  I've never seen anything like this on my other cameras.  My first 200 shots were fine, but the more I took the worse this problem became.  Sadly, I purchased the camera for the recent Formula One race in Austin, TX.  I took roughly 3,500 shots during the four days I was at the track.  I am infuriated that most of these shots will need extensive retouching to fix these flaws.If you already own one of these cameras it's easy to find the problem.  Shoot a picture of the sky or a light-colored wall.  Underexpose a stop or two to help you see the spots.  If you have the issue it will be very apparent.And IF you have the issue please return your camera immediately!  I don't have any issues with Nikon on a personal level, but they need to be pressured into fixing this problem -- and big companies don't spring into action unless financial circumstances warrant it.  If enough people return their D600s -- and if enough people complain and make this problem known -- Nikon will be forced to fix the design flaw.  Furthermore, they will be less likely to let another design with this flaw slip through into production.I hope this review keeps others from going through this same experience!", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon D600 vs D700 vs D800", "Author": "Michael Allebach \"Tattooed Bride Photographer...", "ReviewID": "R2EBQV674OPXEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So after getting to play with the new camera I wanted to give you a heads up on what I thought about it.  I've shot over 100,000 images with my d700 and have loved that camera.  I've rented the D800 for weddings and shot thousands of images with it.  I want to tell you how I landed on the D600 as the camera I will use along side of my D700 at weddings.  All cameras all full frame so I think it's pretty fair to compare.> D700I have loved this camera this has been my workhorse.  70% of my images are taken with the 85 1.4 and D700 combo.  It just works.  That being said this camera is old and compared to the others it doesn't stack up very well.ProsFeel - It has the best feel out of all the cameras because it is a bit taller and fits nicely in my hand.AF Mode Button - The placement on the back of the camera means I can switch without looking or taking my eyes of my subject.

I wish they kept it where it was on the D700.  I use this button constantlyNo CF card slot> CONCLUSIONWhen it came down to it, the price on the D600 was just right along with the file size.  I considered buying a used D700 or a New D800 (instead of renting) but when the D600 was announced I knew it would be the right fit.  It was bigger than I thought, which was a good thing because I've held the D3200 in my hand and that feels like a toy.  This camera is almost as big as the D700.  I still have to see in low light how fast the AF performance is on the camera but I am guessing it will be about even with the D700.  On Saturday I will have my first full wedding with the camera but all the files that I have seen look incredible.  This camera will be a hot seller and people WILL be raving fans.  I can guarantee that.  Also if you are between the D800 and the D600 and aren't a landscape photographer, you won't be disappointed with the resolution of the D600.  In real world situations there isn't much difference once a photo is printed out between 36MP and 24MP.A rumor: It is rumored that the images out of the D600 are of a slightly higher quality than the Nikon D4 (the $6000 brand new pro camera).  Of course the D4 was built for speed but it is amazing to think that their prosumer camera is on the same quality level or higher as their newest top of the line camera.So far I'm extremely happy with my decision to go with the Nikon D600.  I hope that will be your choice too!> HACKS & UPDATES SINCE ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS WRITTEN (Last updated 10.3.2012)Didn't notice there is no AF-ON button till I went to separate the Autofocus & Shutter button like I had setup on my D700.  So I had to reprogram the AE button to be the AF-On button.  So far so good.It seems like the AF is really snappy in lower light and locks on better than the D700 or D800.I went ahead a filmed a minidocumentary of my friend Fearless Jaleel King with it (go and watch it to see the quality of the video - amazing!).  Turned out pretty awesome.  I used a $30 lapel mic from Radio Shack and a set of cheap headphones.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally, full frame value", "Author": "D. Emerson", "ReviewID": "R1B7SM8FISRQUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaced my F5/FM2n... yes, I've been a film holdout for all this time.  I've had some digital point-and-shoot cameras, but stuck by my film for \"real\" photos for a few reasons:1. Until full frame DSLRs hit 12MP, I was getting more resolution out of my 35mm film (Ektar 100 / Portra 400 / Velvia 50) easily.  I was also getting way better dynamic range out of my film until the most recent generation of full frame DSLR sensors, which now finally comes close to the dynamic range of film.2. I am an occasional shooter and not a pro - so the cost per film shot, which works out to around $0.25/frame for me with development and scanning/printing, was totally reasonable compared to what it would have cost until now to take the same number of photos on a digital camera at the same level of quality I was getting.  Heretofore, I would have had to buy at least a D3/D3s/D800/D700, and those are expensive to have sitting around not being used professionally or even on a weekly basis.3. I have only \"FX\" lenses, and about 70% of it is AI-S.  None of it is AF-S (what's autofocus is AF-D), so I had to have a screw-drive AF motor and I had to have a non-CPU lens memory bank.  D600 has both, and it's full frame, so I don't have any of this funky crop factor crap.4. Depth of field.  I've got mostly very high-quality lenses, all primes and mostly f<2.  I like the control of DoF they offer me.  DoF at sensors smaller than APS-C is a poor joke, and I've seen APS-C look ok, but just didn't see the point in limiting my lenses.5. Viewfinder.  If you haven't ever looked through a 100% \"FX\" viewfinder, you might not understand how awful most DSLR viewfinders look to people using film or a proper \"FX\" DSLR like the D4/D3/D3s/D700/D800.  I might not take a lot of photos, but I'd rather not spend my time staring down a short railroad tunnel squinting at the lights on the other end, especially if I'm going to be focusing manually.Ok, so ultimately, I bought the D600.  Now down to the actual product review.Things that took some getting used to:- I don't have a full set of AF / AE-lock buttons like I used to on the F5.  D800 and D4 still have these, but D600 has one \"catch all\" button.  Thankfully, this button can be reprogrammed entirely to perform any of the three old functions, or it can be reprogrammed to an unrelated function, too, so it's quite flexible.  I am using it as \"AF-on\" right now, and I have the \"Fn\" key bound to \"AE-lock\", which compensates for the loss of the dedicated buttons on the back.- Auto ISO.  I'm not sure how I am going to deal with this, but I find Auto-ISO both useful for time savings, and annoying conceptually.  It tends to adjust ISO a little too readily for my taste, but perhaps this feeling will fade when I adapt to the whole \"ISO is more or less unimportant nowadays\" thing.- Autofocus-Continuous/Single button simplified to AF/MF.  This is a little annoying because it makes the functionality of autofocus ambiguous.  I believe the default functionality is fairly similar to AF-Continuous on my F5, but I more typically use autofocus in AF-Single mode, which doesn't track subjects.  My subjects don't move much. **Update: Thanks for the tip, James, I see that this was just me not exploring enough, or, put another way, I should RTFM.  The switch has indeed been revised so it's a two position switch, modified by a button in the middle of the selector. All functionality remains, and all is well**- Viewfinder has an odd eyepiece.  It's a great viewfinder to use, but that eyepiece is a little small and odd (ergonomically) to hold up to the face.  This coming from someone used to the veritable porthole-window on the F5 should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt.  I'm also an eyeglass wearer, but my correction is so minimal that I don't mind just taking off my glasses to use the D600.  Didn't have to do that with the F5, but not a big deal.- It's not all that small.  Yes, it weighs about a pound less than my last camera, and that's a welcome change, but it's thicker and just as wide.  Actually, this is the thickest darn camera I've owned, and I don't understand why.  The F5 is a tank and probably about as happy pounding nails as any hammer in my house, but the fact remains that it feels, and measures, slim compared to the D600 (or most full frame DSLRs I've seen).  The comparison to film cameras gets even more odd looking when you place the FM2n next to the D600... FM2n looks like a rangefinder, practically.  So maybe this has to do with the sensor or the screen or whatever, but I know that it's not the optics, since flange distance and all that jazz is identical.  Nevertheless, I'm happy it's light, which is is... very light.- > 0 < indicator for manual focus is a little squirrely compared to the F5.  I suspect this is because the emphasis is so much more on autofocus now, and the distance between AF sensors has gotten so much smaller.  Anyway, it's good enough, just not as good as it used to be when cameras were made with manual focus in mind as a large percentage of lenses.- No viewfinder screens from Nikon, at least yet.  I used a grid screen with microprism collar and rangefinder center before this on the F5, which was nice as a MF aid.  Also not a huge deal, just ergonomic.- \"Scene Modes\" ??  Why is this useful?  At least I can ignore it.Things I like:- I can shoot with impunity.  Almost have to, now that I've got a $2000 debit from my account to justify to myself.- Picture quality is really, really good.  Certainly better than my photos deserve.- I get matrix metering with my AI-S lenses.  Maybe this is common now and I didn't realize it, but of the autoexposure film cameras Nikon made, only three that I know of had matrix for AI-S -- F6, F4 and FA.  I'm fine with center weighted, but matrix is definitely more convenient for normal lighting.- ISO 6400 looks a lot like ISO 1600, which looks mostly like ISO 800, which isn't so bad compared to ISO 400, which looks like ISO 200??? ISO is irrelevant on this sensor.  Well, maybe not irrelevant, but it sure is impressive to be shooting above 800 and have such minimal noise.- It's fast.  Don't notice shutter lag, and the buffer hasn't given out on multi-shot sprees yet, though I do have a lot of the \"auto\" stuff off, which speeds things up (like the auto anti-vignette, auto d-light, etc).- Mirror lockup.  No, it doesn't have the little lever anymore, but I like the way they implemented mirror lockup.  If you buy the IR remote, first click can lock mirror, second click triggers shutter. This is great for astrophotos.- Key rebinding.  Nikon allows you to rebind many of the buttons on the body to your preferred function.  You could do this on the F5, but only to a very limited degree.  D600 allows for comprehensive customization of the button functions, and this more than makes up for any shortcomings in the number of buttons included.- LCD.  Seeing what you just shot is great!  I'm used to getting preview only on my crappy cameras, where critical focus is hardly a concern and sharpness is more or less limited by the crap lens attached.  Plus, the screen on the D600 is quite nice.  Very good resolution and brightness.- Lens compatibility.  Everything works, and my lenses are old.  Non-CPU lens memory stores focal length and aperture for you, so you can shoot with full metering on AI-S lenses.- Menu layout.  Yes, there are a lot of settings.  It's almost overwhelming compared to what I'm used to.  But they're well laid out, and I have no issues with the depth of the menus.  Plus, way easier to set \"Turn on viewfinder gridlines\" than try to remember that Option 15 should be \"2\".  And if you find yourself using something all the time from the menu, bind it to a physical button and you're done.All in all, I am glad I didn't get a D800E.  I almost did, but just felt it was still too expensive.  I'm also glad I never got bilked into the APS-C \"DX\" game.  The D600 is a perfect camera for someone who isn't a professional, but who expects their gear to work like good film gear worked, and I figure I'm especially pleased because I've been living in the photography stone age, so this thing is practically magic.I have not even tried the video features, so cannot comment there.Highly recommended camera.-------------- Update a few days on --------------Still very pleased with the D600.  I have now shot using most of my lenses, and I'm over 550 frames.  It takes great photos in all light levels.As an update to the auto-ISO matter, I maintain that auto-ISO is somewhat difficult to understand, at least in Aperture Priority and Manual modes.  When I adjust aperture, for example, it often changes the ISO instead of changing the shutter speed to compensate.  Shutter speed stays pretty fixed, and it's like I'm effectively balancing exposure with aperture and ISO instead of balancing between aperture and shutter, with ISO moving only once that balance becomes impractical due to light and shake constraints.  I have not switched the mode back to manual ISO, but if I don't start figuring out its logic, I'm going to.Another \"Caveman Lawyer\" moment - I found out this evening that I can bind a function to the \"DoF\" key.  Here I was thinking DoF preview key would be mechanical, like on all my other cameras, but no- it's rebindable too!  Good thing, since I almost never have need for DoF preview, especially now that I can simply take a photo and preview it on the beautiful LCD.  I bound Spot Meter to this key, and the functionality is great.To summarize, then, I have been able to rebind functions for:- \"DoF Preview\" key (rebound to Spot Meter)- \"Fn\" key (rebound to AE-L)- \"AE-L/AF-L\" key (rebound to AF-On)I tried a long burst earlier today, and filled the buffer for the first time.  Was able to take 13 shots at full speed and full resolution / quality before it slowed down.  That's a lot of pictures at full speed, and there's a neat \"rXX\" value that pops up in the viewfinder, indicating how fast the buffer is processing the shots you've taken (and how many shots you have in reserve that can be taken).  When you exhaust the buffer, the value will read \"r00\", and when it's ready to take another, say, two shots, it'll read \"r02\".  Time between shots after buffer was exhausted was around 1 second.  Maybe people who know better will complain about this, but again: I'm from the stone age... it's true my F5 could go through a roll at about 8fps, but I'd rather go through 13 shots at 5.5fps and have it cost me nothing at all than be forever afraid that I'd invoke crazy-motor-drive-mode on the F5 and waste a roll in under 5 seconds.  The buffer is definitely sufficient for my needs.Having carried it now for a few hours at a time, I can definitely say I stick to my assessment regarding burden: it is not a small camera, but it is very light.Oh, and battery life is excellent for something that has an LCD screen.Finally, regarding quiet mode, represented by \"Q\" on the drive mode dial: this is the same as the \"Cs\" mode on the F5, and I'm sure other cameras have it as well.  Just like the F5, it isn't really quiet at all.  In fact, the sound pressure peak of the noise is nearly the same as the peak of the standard shutter noise.  Granted the peak is shorter, and the total impulse of sound longer, but that's just the thing -- on both the F5 and the D600, \"Quiet Mode\" should really be called \"what-the-hell-was-that-odd-unhealthy-camera-like-noise\" mode.  Just use the regular shutter and stop taking pictures if you need to be that quiet.  Or get a Leica.-------------- After a week --------------No regrets.  I took this out over the weekend to the dark wilderness and did some astrophotography.  The battery life is fantastic, the mirror lockup mode using the remote is likewise wonderful, and the camera's noise levels in -complete darkness- are unbelievably low.  It's like shooting a film camera, really, except not paying for film.  Heck, about the only thing I can think of that might be disadvantageous for this camera vs., say, an FM2n for astrophotos is the battery consumption for very long shots.  But with digital, to hell with long shots anyway.  Take fifty 30-second exposures and stack them; then you hardly even need a mount.After the night (mostly awake playing with the camera under the stars), I woke up and did some hiking.  Spent that whole day using only MF lenses.  Everything up to my 135mm is just fine with the stock viewfinder screen.  Unfortunately, I do miss the microprism collar and rangefinder center for the 200mm and 300mm lengths.  It's just darn hard to focus manually without those aids at such a power, and I can attest to it not being as hard on the F5 (with swapped viewfinder screen).  Then again, I can stop down enough that focus isn't as critical with this sensor and still have good shutter speeds, so who cares?I will probably get a third party / accessory viewfinder screen if that ever becomes available.  If not, I can deal.This weekend also marks the first time I used my \"heavy\" lenses for an extended period.  No, I wasn't in -10F or anything, but the polymer faceplate didn't have any trouble supporting heavy telephoto primes.  This camera is sturdy.  Perhaps the F5 can stand up to abuse, but I plan on using my cameras, not abusing them, and the D600 is plenty good enough for any real use I might have.  I will make sure to report back on how it performs next time I am in low temps.Video!  I finally used this mode.  It works great and quality is very high.  No bad noises in the mic, no \"jelly\" motion or shearing.  I only shot with a 28mm AI-S lens, but all was quite well.Ergonomics- I can do everything now without taking my eye off the viewfinder.  This camera will be very familiar to anybody who has used a Nikon since the F5.  Buttons are where they should be, and the stuff that's been invented since that era isn't much of an additional burden to learn, since it's all quite well thought out.  What has been left out of this camera that remains on the professional line can easily be compensated for with the aforementioned key rebinding.A few gripes:- What could it have cost to give me an eyepiece shutter?  I got some kind of plastic thing that that I'm never going to carry with me. Nikon, integrate this feature.  Not a big deal, but silly.- The stock strap is gaudy and stiff.  Thankfully, the camera is light enough that I just swapped the strap out with paracord (550 cord) and it's plenty comfy.  I've always swapped my straps on light cameras for paracord, but never could get away with that on the F5, since it was so heavy and the cord would press uncomfortably into my shoulder (even making marks after a long day).- I wish there were a way to lock up the mirror for multiple frames.  I feel bad cycling the mirror each time I take a series of astrophotos.  No need for the mirror to work 50 times just because the shutter needs to cycle 50 times.  Maybe I just don't know how to do this yet?- Playback mode could be smarter.  When you ask the camera to store JPG+RAW, you have to browse through both JPG+RAW in playback mode.  I can see this being useful to someone, but you should be able to optionally limit playback to one or the other.  Where this really gets annoying is deletion.  When I shoot JPG+RAW, review, and decide I don't want to keep a shot, I must delete the JPG and then delete the RAW.  They aren't always even sequential, which means I have to figure out what I haven't deleted yet, or be left with a patchwork of orphaned RAW/JPG files that I don't want!  Just offer the option to hide one or the other in playback mode, and I'll be happy.  And make deletion actions applicable to both the RAW and the JPG of the same photo.- The Auto ISO thing never worked out.  I turned it off, and I'm perfectly happy switching between ISOs when necessary myself.  Ergonomics are so good on this camera that I've got that movement memorized now.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dusty....", "Author": "J.

I am so happy with the image quality, build quality, features and basically everything about this little dusty gem. The positives are countless and other reviewers provided excellent insight on the capabilities of this camera and that's why I didn't give it a 1-star review, because IT'S indeed a great camera. Scores speak for themselves. I used a D300, D700, D7000 before and the D600 really outperforms all of them in every aspect, except that the AF in the D700 is superior especially in low light. I used to shoot a lot of HDR but now I hardly do HDR due to the incredible dynamic range of the D600. ISO performance (not highest ISO setting) is one the best among all FX cameras if not the best based on scores and what I have seen. In a nutshell, for the price (or even for a much higher price) the D600 sets new standards for full frame cameras at this price level.Now of course you saw that coming, the dust/oil issue. Folks who are apologetic/fanboys/offensive, seriously quit it. The issue is real whether you like it or not, and no it's not a fact of life with all DSLRs and those experiencing it SHOULD be upset, and they are many and I dare say more than those who are happy. If everyone is apologetic like you then the D800 AF issues and the D7000 issues would have never been addressed, if they were addressed to begin with. Not just users are complaining, even lensrentals, DPreview and many other credible photography communities have confirmed it. You only have to watch the now famous/infamous timelapse video to realize that the issue is internal, it's a design flaw with regards to the shutter mechanism. Wet cleaning your sensor every 500 shots is not normal. Wet cleaning a new camera is not normal. Bragging that you only shoot wide open and never noticed the issue is off-topic since it doesn't mean everyone shoots wide open. I mainly shoot landscape and typically use slow apertures for maximum depth of field (f/8-f/16) and a single spot would ruin the image for me. It's true that it's easily fixed in PS but that's only if it's one or a few spots, not hundreds, and certainly not in every image!IMO, the main idea behind writing a review is to help potential customers decide whether to buy the product or not based on a general consensus provided by previous owners. Most of us who see a 2-star product with 100 reviews will shy away form that product without even bothering to read the reviews. That's why I think it's not fair to give the D600 a 1-star rating because of the dust/oil issue since it's a great camera in all regards. My 3-star rating is just a warning for potential buyers that if you are going to buy the camera expect dust, lots of dust even after sensor cleaning.

Overall, what you'd expect a full frame camera to be until you start using it and wondering why they decided to do certain things the way they do.More seriously, I have not found a way to change the aperturewhile in video mode even when not shooting.  This is a serious flaw.  The D800 does it and I don't think this should be something that's left out on purpose if they want a serious video camera.  I have to switch back to photography mode, pick the aperture, then switch back to video mode and start shooting.  If the conditions change while shooting, you're SOL.I was also annoyed at how the AF doesn't lock in when there is still plenty of light/contrast in the scene when using a flagship f/2.8 Nikkor lens.  If the subject is close, it's not a big deal because the AF assist light kicks in, but for things like concerts or weddings where you have to stay at a distance and it's low light, you're SOL again.Furthermore, the AF points are clustered in the center.  This is annoying but I could make it work, just leaves more wiggle room in the rule of thirds.As for the Oil issue, it's too early for me to check but this is a serious concern and I hope Nikon comes out and addresses it.  Man up Nikon.  Public Relations do matter.Less serious, why did they reverse the zoom in and zoom out buttons than previous generations?***update #1 after 2 days of owning*****I wanted to make sure my review of the focus system was fair so last night and tonight, on this holiest of weekends (Halloween), I took the camera out to a few bars and clubs.  This time I had an SB-800 flash on the camera which means that the camera uses the flash's Auto-Assist matrix light.  Again, the camera failed to lock in focus on any other point except for the center.  Again, I was using the Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8 (a freaking $1900 pro lens).  I don't think I can really trust this camera too much in low light which is sad considering I got a full frame camera for low light.  The AF system is severely lacking in this camera.Another problem I found is the LCD screen is larger but very poor. I guess it's better that pictures in the back look worse than on the computer since in the past it was the other way around with my Nikons but I just can't trust this camera very much during these situations.***update #2***I had 3 very different shoots yesterday.  One was at a professional sports arena pretty close to the court.  Using the 85mm f/1.8, the AF was very good.  No issues at all.Shoot #2 was in day light shooting at ISO 100.  Again, everything was beautiful.Shoot #3, at a dark museum.  On some items (very large well lit) exhibits, it was fine, but as soon as there was anything with a reflection, the lens failed.  this was mostly with my 80-200mm f/2.8 AF-D lens.Another thought, RAW files are HUGE on this - damn near 30 MB...*****Update #3****Hold everything.  I found 10 oil spots on my sensor.  At first I thought it was 3, but it's all over the place mostly around the left and top.  What a piece of garbage.Update #4Nikon is not answering emails, phones, nor tweets. Nice.Update #5Nikon finally decided to answer their phone. Smuggy woman who answered the phone said there were no widespread problems with the D600 and told me not to believe my own eyes nor the eyes of many others.  She ignored all the links and sample pictures I sent and refused to send a shipping label.  All she offered was to send me to a link to send the camera in but then I'd have to pay for shipping.  6 pounds, across the country, fully insured is about $60.  I'm sending it to BH now to see if the replacement will work.Update #6, BH (which has GREAT customer service by the way in case amazon doesn't work out for you for various reasons *cough* sales tax) Sent me the replacement and that too had dust.Before sending it back to Nikon, I gave the replacement a dusting with the blower rocket and also canned air and it looked as if it blew most of the dust away.  This time at least it was only dust.**Final update**It is now 4-19-2013 and I have owned this camera since October of 2012.  So all in all, it's been 6 months.Throughout this time I've had to clean the sensor 3 times.  1st time I did it myself, 2nd time I sent it in, and last time I just blew compressed air and it got everything.  That's just a fact of life with this camera.  I wish it wasn't, but it is and it seems like the dust issue becomes a minor thing after the initial cleanings.  I am also not happy that you can't change the aperture in live view mode.For the photographs however, this camera is superb.  Often in the past I would have to use fill flash in many situations just to try to balance light out but with this camera, the dynamic range is so high that I get away with lifting the shadows later.  The ISO performance is also insane.  I don't give using ISO 6400 a second thought.Final (really final) updateIt is now November 2013. The dust is still here and gotten worse.

The salesman at the camera store played with the camera for a few minutes and tried a couple of their lenses. He said the autofocus mechanism appeared to be broken and I would need to send the camera back to Amazon.I spoke with Amazon and they said I would need to contact Nikon directly because I purchased the product over 30 days ago (September 29). I called Nikon and they gave me the address for their returns center and the procedures for the return. They said it is my responsibility to pay for shipping. I said I thought they should pay since the autofocus should not have broke and the sensor should not be getting oil spots on it. Bottom line, the customer service has been poor. They told me several times (after playing the I need to check with my manager game) that they would send me a label for free shipping. It has never come - after repeated calls with their customer service department over two days. Nikon customer service is nice on the phone but NEVER follow through with what they say they will do.I told the Nikon customer service agent that I have bought two cameras and over $10,000 in Nikon equipment over the last 4 years, and, as a matter of principle, they should pick up the cost of shipping my camera for repair. They must have some type of internal program to wear down customers to minimize their costs. Here is what I learned:1. Be careful of being an early adopter of technology. I should have waited 6 months for thorough reviews of the camera.2. If buying new technology, buy the equipment at a local camera shop. They will give you better service as they have a strong incentive to please their local customers.3. Nikon does not do a good job with customer service. They are behind the times in this area and do not understand how to build a relationship with their customers.Well, I will be shipping my camera UPS this morning to the Nikon Repair Center and paying the shipping costs. Nikon you win. Your strategy was successful.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera ruined by bad quality and corporate hubris", "Author": "71Stang", "ReviewID": "R2EPCKNSVI251U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First SLR I ever purchased was a Nikon. That was 30 years ago and I have stayed with Nikon since then. I'm not a pro, but an enthusiast. But I do take my pictures seriously. Meaning that I'm not in the habit of spending upwards of $3,000 and then take snapshots.I waited a long time for Nikon to make a full-frame DSLR for someone like me and held onto my 35mm lenses for 10 years. Finally they come up with the D600. So far so good. Not!After using it for three months I have returned the camera, and have hated doing it. The camera is great in every respect for a prosumer like me. The full-frame sensor was a sheer delight after spending 8 years with a D70. Loved taking existing light shots with it. I could easily take indoor pictures with dramatic room lighting at 1600 and even 3200 ISO with very little noise visible. And all that at 24M pixels that would allow you to crop if necessary! Also, with my long lenses I could have great portraits again also. And in terms of features, everything that a prosumer like me would want is right there - such as HDR, DOF etc. Auto-focus is mostly fine, though it tends to hunt in low light situations. Which is not a problem, relative to other cameras in this class. It's just that the camera has such great low-light capabilities that you run into it more often.However, the oil spots showed up as predicted by others. And I have read enough by others, and I have waited more than four months to see if Nikon will own up to it. Nope, They won't. So, Goodbye Nikon. The camera has been returned.The only thing an arrogant company will understand is customer returns and the resulting warranty losses. Large Japanese companies are particularly prone to living in denial for decades. If you don't believe this, go look at how Olympus management has basically destroyed that company. And though Sony is making great cameras, their arrogance and inability to listen has cost them the music, eReader and other consumer markets. If Nikon doesn't wakeup, it will go the same way.Had it not been for the quality problem, I would have given it 5 starts. As-is, I will not waste time with it. If you have time to kill and you have the ability to return it for full credit with ease after taking at least 500 shots, preferably 1,000, you may want to try one to see if you're one of the lucky ones. Apparently some people are - judging from all the reviews here. Though I think many other reviewers are simply not looking for the spots.Do the spots matter? Yes, they do in a camera in this class. With your everyday shots of the kids, family, etc., you will not notice them. But in a landscape shot with blue sky in the upper half of the picture, they will be noticeable. They may also become noticeable in snap shots if the background is a plain and not dirty white. And they will keep getting worse. Some folks have said that they will simply keep wet-cleaning the sensor and get around the problem. Yes, you can. However, please be advised that Nikon specifically tells you in the users' guide to not do that yourself. They want you to keep sending the camera back to them to clean it - as long as it is in warranty, which is one year. Not a good deal in my book.If you do decide to roll the dice and purchase one, do take couple of reference shots when the camera is new and save them. Use a flat white background or blue sky as the background - the latter being the best. Set the aperture to F=16 or greater numeric number. Then take the same shot after 500 or more shots and compare. They mostly show up in the upper and middle left side of the image. (I checked after 750 shots and did not use any Photoshop tricks to accentuate the spots). But make sure to do this within the return period.What are the alternatives? If you must have the full-frame, consider the Nikon D800. But it is  bulkier and its 36MP files are apparently cumbersome to deal with and an overkill according to many. Also, it also did have quality issues, but they may be fixed by now since that camera has been out longer. Please read the reviews on that camera, as I do not make any recommendations on the D800. If the DX sensor is OK with you, then the D7000 apparently is a great camera and well tested in the market. Nikon just put out the D7100 - which is apparently the DX version of the D600 in terms of all the latest features. This may be a great camera, but how do we trust Nikon in the quality department? I personally will not buy a Nikon now until the camera has been in the field for a year at least. They have lost my trust. Canon has the 6D which is very similar to the D600 in features, performance and price. It seems to have no quality problems. My only issue with the 6D is that it has no built-in flash.Good luck.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera with a tiny hitch.", "Author": "albert", "ReviewID": "R2R3DK9A6AFZDG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of, I'd like to give a little background as to what kind of a photographer I am. I'm an amateur/hobbyist photographer and I mainly take photos of family, automotive photography, traveling shots, architecture photography as well as various precious moments in my life. I've been predominantly a point and shoot camera user for most of my life up until 3 years ago when I decided to expand to the world of DSLR with the entry level Nikon D5000. Since then I've been progressively expanding my world of photography. I've been dreaming of a full frame SLR camera for over a year but since most full frame cameras are well over my budget, such a purchase had to wait. Until the Nikon D600 came out. It was the right price point for something I had the budget to get into. Being that this is my first venture with full frame cameras, please excuse my review if it's not as technical or complete as other professional photographers and my only real basis of comparison with the D600 is with my old D5000. Perhaps think of this review for those who are also new to full frame cameras or those who are thinking about going from DX to FX.First impressions upon opening the box.Build quality, fit and finish from an exterior point of view is top notch. The camera feels good in my hands and with the textured plastic/rubberized body, it looks and feels much better than my old D5000 and yet my D5000 still looks new to this day. Seems like this D600 would last the test of time on my hands. Though keep in mind, I'm not a professional photographer and I do not take photos everyday.First impression on the first few shots.I took my first few shots indoors at a restaurant and immediately found the shots looking real fantastic and sharp. The ability for the camera to take low light shots while indoors was amazing and I found that there wasn't much noise on the shots either, even at high ISO levels. The autofocus was able to catch on fairly quickly and pick out the subjects I was shooting at almost intuitively. Playing around with the manual settings was easy and though the D5000 had a much newbie friendly interface, the D600 is obviously much more complete and customizable. After going through the manual a couple of times, just to get oriented with the interface, the rest was a breeze. Nikon users would surely find the menu system, settings, etc very similar with previous cameras. I also found the function buttons on the front of the camera very useful and were placed just right for my fingers to reach when I'm holding the camera to take a shot.The D600 came with as a kit with the standard 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR AF-S Nikkor Lens. I know this may not be the best lens that Nikon has to offer, but it sure surpasses my needs and requirements for photography at this point in time. Indoor shots are great and outdoor shots are amazing. Though I am looking into expanding my range to better Nikkor lenses down the road and I've read that doing so would really unleash the D600's capabilities even more. I was also very happy to find that my old DX lenses would still work on the D600. I've collected a few Nikkor DX lenses over the years and having the ability to still use them was a nice bonus. The D600 would automatically adjust for the DX lens so swapping from FX to DX and back to FX is as simple as plug and play.More time with the D600.At this moment in time, I've had the D600 for more than a couple of weeks already and so far things are good. Though I have noticed some dust spots on some of my shots (more on that later). But despite the dust spots, the camera is still performing great. Battery life seems to be great though I've noticed it does take a bit longer than expected for the battery to charge up. A faster charging system would have been nice. When compared to my old D5000, the battery on the D5000 would charge much faster but I've also noticed that the battery life on the D5000 is shorter. I suppose longer charging time translates to more juice for the D600, which makes sense so I'm not up in arms with this issue. I would just leave the battery charging overnight (hope that doesn't destroy the battery), and just slap it back on the camera in the morning. Though I can see how this would be an issue if you're a heavy user of the camera and are on location at a shoot or so. Purchasing a second battery would obviously be the best solution at that point.The monitor is sharp and crisp with image playback spot on. The images look pretty much just like how they would on the big screen computer. Of course not all details can be seen but it's good enough to make sure you got the right settings and such for the shot. I used to have a big issue with this on the D5000 where my shots looked great on the monitor, only to be disappointed when I uploaded the shots on my computer.Being an amateur/hobbyist photographer, there are times where I just don't want to think and just snap away or sometimes the moment I wish to capture happens quickly, then putting the D600 in auto-mode is something I find works great. There are many modes to choose from, from indoor, landscape, portrait, night shot, etc, etc. Granted leaving much of the settings to the camera to decide won't necessarily yield the best shot but I find that it still far surpasses any point and shoot camera I have ever owned and far surpasses the D5000. Even when my friends/family see the shots I've taken on auto mode, they are still blown away with the quality images. They actually think I'm a professional photographer! Hahaha... Rrright... So overall, this camera is starting to look great and makes me look real great in the process as well! Could I ask for anything more?Now on to the dust issue.This is the dreaded moment and the Achilles heel for the D600 it seems. Before purchasing the camera, I read tons and TONS of reviews and complaints about dust and in some cases oil being flung into the sensor of the camera causing issues of spots showing up on your shots at certain settings. I believe it was F11 onwards to F16. When I purchased my D5000, there were a bunch of complaints and issues on the camera as well. Some problems even required Nikon to do a Service Advisory. I eventually found out about this, did a check and it turned out that my D5000 was one of those under the advisory. I never did anything about it and to this day, the D5000 still works great. That being said, I knew of this dust/oil issue problem going into purchasing the camera but I figured maybe people were just over-reacting or maybe those guys just got a bad batch. I've read that as the camera get used and periodically cleaning the sensor would eventually solve the issue but cleaning the sensor myself is not something I'm willing to do. The other option is to send it out to Nikon for a cleaning, but that takes weeks! Not something I'm also willing to live with on a routinely basis during my first few months of ownership. But despite this, the positive reviews on the camera taking exceptional shots were just too good to pass up (proven to myself already as I've stated above). So, I figured I would take my chances and I still decided to give the camera a try. Btw, thank goodness for return policies. I figured, worst case, I could still return the camera maybe grab that new laptop I've always wanted for the same amount of cash instead.So just recently, I decided to test out whether or not my D600 had the dust/oil issue. I took a clean shot of the sky at F11 up to F16 and to my horror, upon viewing them on the computer, I noticed three specs on my shot on the upper left hand corner of the image. Fearing the worst, I opened up the camera and took a good look at the sensor itself. True enough, there were three very visible spots on the sensor and a cluster of small spots on the mirror. Couldn't tell if they were dust or oil but I used my Giottos air blower to see if I could blow it out. They flew off after just the first few puffs of air. Looks like dust to me. Did some more test shots and the shots looked clear. Sounds like I'm in the clear for now and there doesn't seem to be any oil on my sensor. Thank goodness. But it still honestly rubs me the wrong way to think that a $2,000++ camera would have issues with dust straight from new. I've never changed lenes or opened up the camera till the cleaning. My D5000 never needed a cleaning until two years down the road after multiple lens swaps at a desert, crowded street markets and other non ideal locations to change a lens. So this is quite a hitch with the D600 and for that reason, I can only give it 4 stars. It's a shame though, because if it wasn't for this problem, this camera would be an easy 6 stars! Yes, I know there's only a max 5 stars but it just goes to show just how impressed I am with the camera's performance.I'm currently at 500 to 600 shots after the cleaning and still no spots. I'll be keeping an eye on this and I'll be sure to update this review if this problem comes back.To sum up, this is a great camera. It surpasses my needs and expectations in every shape and form. The quality, clarity, sharpness, colors of each shot I've taken so far are exceptional. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's looking to get into full frame cameras at a decent price point or anyone who just wants to have darn good pictures taken. In my case, the photos and moments I've been able to capture with this camera are priceless. For that reason alone, this Nikon D600 is worth every penny to me.Hope this review helps!--- February 21, 2013 UPDATE ---I've been using this camera for some time already, a little over three months. I've taken about 5,000 shots with it and so far the camera's been excellent. So good that I've already started my investment on some upgraded FX lenses. Considering each lens is well into the $1,000 range, that's quite a commitment on my end with this camera and just goes to show my earned confidence with this D600.I said I would report on any dust/oil spot problems if it comes back but thankfully it has not. I did have to clean the senor twice during the first month of use with my Giottos air blower due to some specs of dust but they flew off easily and since then, the sensor has been dust/oil free. I would like to think I'm in the clear already since I already have a lot of shots taken and hopefully would never need to worry about cleaning the sensor again.In conclusion, far so good and this camera continues to amaze me every time I take it out! Combined together with my new upgraded lenses, the photos I've been getting are absolutely fantastic! I find myself getting more and more into photography because of this camera and it has now become a very serious hobby of mine.

I did a ton of research before and since I purchased my D600. I am now convinced the only people who claim not to have the oil spots have either 1) not shot it enough, or 2) not used the camera at settings that show the spots. I went a couple of months thinking I got one of the good ones. I typically shoot people and sports, and usually at apertures between f/1.8 and f/5.6. One day I find myself looking at a beautiful sunrise, and change the settings to f/11-f/16.

Nikon has finally (and Nikon rarely does this) acknowledged the problem, and they suggest attempting to clean the sensor according to instructions in the camera manual, and if that doesn't help, sending it in for factory service.  I suggest skipping trying to clean the sensor yourself.  Send it in to Nikon Factory Service.

Do a little research online, and thorougly check your camera.  You may have not noticed the problem because your images are obscuring the spots.

For instance, the site said it was done for 6 days, and when I called them, they said, \"well sometimes when it says \"bill\" for a long period of time, it's actually been shipped.\"  So even their own techs know that the web site info means nothing.Something is clearly wrong here and from the reviews, I don't think it's a small percentage at all.  One rental place said all 20 of their cameras were effected.  20/20 with the same issue?  Mnnn.I hope this isn't a life long issue with this camera.  It was cleaned under warranty although I am not sure why ... if it were something I did, they wouldn't cover it under warranty would they?I wouldn't have bought the camera if I knew about this issue.  I would have waited, it's just not worth the embarrassment and unknown future.  I surely can't send this camera in for 4 weeks several times a year ...not to mention that after the warranty is gone, I will have to pay for it.I wouldn't recommend this camera at all right now.  Once Nikon says they have the problem fixed ...... then no problem.UPDATE:  So the review above was done in Early 2013.  Since then I sent the camera back in July 2013 and I was told they replaced the shutter.  Today, October 2013, I am sending the camera back for the third time for the same dirt/dust/oil spots.  After talking with Nikon support over and over again concerning the same problem, it's my opinion that there is little sympathy or understanding of what this is putting customers through.  Out of 12 months that I have owned the camera, it has been out of my hands for more than two months.  That's not the bad part.  The bad part is they apparently don't know how to repair this problem and I am stuck with a dud.  The attitude that I get from Nikon is, \"well, that's just your bad luck.\"  They also \"have no information about the problem.\"  It's just surreal dealing with these people.  It would seem no one knows anything and no one has the \"authorization\" to do anything to make the situation right.  The support is nice enough, just none of them know or can do anything.  I have never had an experience quite like this with a technology company.  Anyway, at this point, I don't want the camera anymore.  It's not reliable and they apparently don't know how to repair the problem yet.  This is just not worth the hassle, for me.

The quick synopsis is as follows: The D600 HAS an issue with dust and oil. They have admitted to an issue finally in Feb. Their cust service is the worst I have experienced. After 6 months we got a full credit from the vendor and purchased a Canon 6D. We are thrilled with the Canon. The technical features are not the D600 but the Canon has not come with the free oil and dust spots that the D600 came with. For more details please feel free to read the entire post. BUYER BEWARE.I bought my wife a D600 in November at this great price of $2,395 from a different vendor (Amazon did not have the same price.) With the holidays we were not able to do too much with it but by February we noticed the issue of dust\\oil\\noise on many of her pictures. My wife was a professional photographer and as we get closer to retirement we are thinking of a small cottage photo business or just enjoying a passionate hobby. This should have been a great experience.We went to the Addison Texas Nikon photo school on Feb 23 and 24th. We decided to wait until after the class to send it in as we followed Nikon's protocol. They reviewed the pictures we sent in and they said send it to them in California. On the 25th we sent it in which cost us $137 ($122 for shipping and insurance and another $15 for the box and packing materials.) We sent it in two day UPS. They did not even acknowledge receipt of the camera until the next week even thought we had proof of delivery. Once they looked at it they simply cleaned the sensor and sent it back.Right out of the box, we barely had the camera body open for 10 seconds while we attached a lens, we experienced the same problem. We called them and went through the hassle of sending in the pictures. By the way we received different instructions each time for the proper way to send files and each time it took several tries. They really should know how to handle large files and be consistent. We implied once again that we did not want to have to pay another $137 to send it back. We received the same email saying sorry but you will need to send us the camera again. We had enough. We were never offered a prepaid UPS label.We went to a great local distributor. We did not buy this from them but since we have shopped there before they were gracious enough to listen to our situation and send it in to the Melville operation on our behalf. Just like you our camera was put on parts hold. They eventually, after 4 weeks and me getting on the phone with them, replaced the shutter mechanism and did a complete low pass filter cleaning. They sent it back apologizing for the issues and even sent me a check to repay me for my original shipping. They explained I should have been offered a free shipping label. There were several other miscommunications that are irrelevant as they had nothing to do with the issue at hand.The camera arrived at the distributor on Thursday and we picked it up on Friday. We shot some pics on Saturday and went to the Dallas zoo on Sunday to put it through some real shooting. We got home Sunday evening and we saw the issue reappear. We started shooting at around 11:30 AM at 1:05 PM we noticed the first issue. We figured this out as we reviewed the shots Sunday evening using Nikon's software. The spots gradually got worse. Yes we do have the pics to back all of this up which we eventually got to send to Nikon on Monday.Monday afternoon they issues an overnight UPS label. I boxed the camera up and sent it back to them. They had a manager intercept put on the label to review. My wife will be travelling internationally next week and we needed the camera (we requested a replacement) before she left. I heard nothing on Tuesday morning but followed up and found out that they had it. I was told I would hear back later that day or early today.  Nothing again. I call up and am told they will speak with the service manager and put in a request for a replacement camera. I would hear within 24 hours. In less than 6 hours they called me and said that the service manager said there is only one spot and they are simply going to clean it and send it back.Now the pictures clearly show more than one spot and additional noise or again more spots. I asked them to review that as I do not believe they reviewed the pictures although why would they agree to overnight something for pickup after they saw the pictures if there was only one spot?So in less than a week I received a refurbished camera with a new shutter mechanism and a cleaned low pass filter. In less than 4 days they requested the camera back. This is the third time it is in for the same issue. They did not offer to replace the camera. They are simply going to send it back after a sensor clean.Here is the dilemma: The original place I purchased the camera from has graciously agreed to take it back and put me into another camera. They said we could either get another D600, a different camera or a store credit. That is customer service. That is a great customer experience. Nikon should learn a lesson from this. Right now I am leaning towards getting rid of our Nikon Gear. You see we also bought a D3200 and a Nikon 105MM micro lens as well as some other smaller items. That may  sound drastic but that is how they have made us feel. We would rather have a nice working model of the D600 but how do I in good conscience reward them with more business after how we were treated and how the other people with poorly working D600 were treated. While I have no idea how prevalent the issue is, the manner in which they have handled it is disgusting. I am happy for all the people who I know and hear about that have working D600. However, a $2000 plus investment for a consumer or a pro is a significant amount of money. With Nikon currently reporting more than a $159M profit this quarter (down almost 50% on a 5% increase in sales), why should their customers take this kid of treatment?For everyone with a good working D600 enjoy. For everyone who has been treated poorly by Nikon customer service I empathize with you. Luckily there are still some great companies that treat their customers with exceptional respect. Nikon could learn a thing or two. They have brought fumeiyo upon themselves.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Nikon Yet but wimpy focus area", "Author": "Robert Cozzi", "ReviewID": "RX6TA1JRE7XJT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[UPDATE 07nov2013]. Got it back from service again. This time the doc actually said they did replace the shutter.  I set out to test it--shooting over 500 shots in and hour on the Ch setting and then going to the park and shooting a f22 all day. Only 1 spot is on the sensor and that one seems to have been there since it was returned. But no additional spots so far.[UPDATE 16Oct2013] After a month of using the D600 _after_ Nikon Service updated the Shutter for me, I am seeing a few more spots on the sensor. I haven't shot a lot of photos -- maybe in the 200 - 300 range, however, there are now a handful of substantial spots on the sensor once again--even with the fix. So if they truly did replace the shutter with that used in the D610, I'm not optimistic about the D610 nor am I'm relaxed about owning the D600.[UPDATE 16Sept2013] I just received my D600 back from Nikon Service. During the NAB in Las Vegas earlier this year, a Nikon Rep told me that they had a \"quiet\" service practice for D600. She said \"Send it in\". I didn't bother doing that until early September of this year and got it back 10 days later. They paperwork said \"clean sensor, upgrade firmware\" so I was concerned. I called and the Service Tech said, yes there's more to it than that, but he wasn't allowed to say--but he did say \"They fixed the problem\".  After a lengthy test shoot of the Sky, timelapse of nature and several \"party\" shots, I see Zero Dust/Grease whatever on the pictures. I believe this camera is now fixed. Thank you Nikon and of course Amazon for the best Customer Service ever![UPDATE 29Nov2012] The 4th unit is now going back to Amazon. This D600 was oil-free and I was very happy for the first 100 or so images. Then excessive dust started to appear. I \"let it go\" for about a week and it seems to have settled down. I called Nikon who told me I could not clean the sensor myself--it had to be sent to a Nikon Authorized service center. But my experience with Nikon service while good, is also VERY time consuming. So this unit is now on its way back to Amazon and another one has been ordered. Let's hope we get both no oil and little to no dust on this one. (Fingers crossed)[UPDATE 21Nov2012]I'm on the 4th D600 from Amazon.com (gotta love their fantastic customer service).The other 3 units had Oil spots either right after shooting or came with oil already on the sensor.This unit seemed okay for the first 40 or so images, and then I saw some particles of dust (not oil) on the sensor. I blew it away and shot another \"roll\" and saw even more dust and what I believe to be 1 or possibly 2 tiny oil spots (the prior units had larger oil spots).Regardless of how good the image quality is, if you can't depend on the product to product pictures vs dusty images (or oily images) it isn't worth your time.My pure speculation is that some units have oil and some have excessive dust. Oil being caused by Nikon assembly workers over-oiling a poorly designed shutter mechanism, and dust if they did not over oil the shutter mechanism. So you get one bad feature or the other.The other camera I have is a D800e and it now has 1 oil spot after roughly 1000 images. I may send it in to be cleaned, assuming no more appear. But this being the 4th D600 I'm going to conclude, based on what I've read here and from my own experience, that this model is definitely NOT ready for prime-time.I would suggest you put off your purchase until either they replace this module with a new one (one that has the problems resolved) or you invest in a cleaning kit and become what most consumers are not, a camera cleaning expert.Oh, and those who keep saying \"are you sure its oil and not dust\" please move along until you actually own one of these models, you're boring the rest of us who are actually trying to make this camera with great potential, work.[Original Review]This camera produces some of the best pictures of any Nikon yet. Sure the D800/e has more pixels, but a 50% increase in those pixels makes your computer run slow as it reads/processes them. Plus, the camera itself slows down as it processes 36 megapixels (again on the D800). This camera has just the right mix of features.So unless you're a pro, this should be your camera if you're a Nikon shooter (or get he new CANON 5D Mk III if you prefer CANON, both are great).This is a full-frame camera, not a Pro Camera. It has all the scene modes you've used from the D7000 but gives you that great depth of field results you normally only see in an FX (full frame) model.Likewise you can use Program/Pro mode, or Aperture or Shutter Priority modes and pull fantastic shots.The Good: FX sensor, 24 megapixels is good enough, more would be a negative feature, fits all your Nikon lens, but start buying FX (non-DX) lenses if you haven't already; it has a fast enough shutter speed and great colors.The not so good: The focus sensors have been purposely crippled on this camera. Instead of using an FX autofocus array from the D4, D800 or other cameras, they use the same autofocus array used on the  D7000 DX camera. This cheat means that you basically have a small area in the center of the view finder in which focus occurs. While this is really offensive to me as a consumer, (shame on you Nikon) it isn't a show-stopper. It too borders on \"good enough\" but I do find it irritating in some situations. So while focus is perhaps the biggest shortcoming feature, it shouldn't stop you from selecting this over other models.Last, like all 2012 Nikon cameras, this model too tends to overexpose its photos when not using matrix metering (e.g., spot metering). So I tend to have to shoot at -0.3ev all the time. The more I use the matrix metering however, I'm learning to know when the camera will work with it vs spot metering. The over exposure that can occur in spot metering (I'm speculating) was done to accommodate those \"ultra stupid hi ISO\" features. If you want to shoot in the dark, get a camera with night vision.So unless you're a professional, get the D600, you'll love it. If you're a pro... keep your D3 or get the D4 or for B-roll consider the D800.OIL SPOTS:One caveat: The original D600 I received was wonderful until I hit about 100 photos. Then a bunch of oil spots on the \"sensor\" (actually on the anti-alias filter) started to appear. Apparently if the person or machine on the assembly line didn't have their coffee, they might have over-oiled the shutter release on your camera. Now, it is easy to clean off dust particles, but oil is problematic. If you look around, you'll see two types of users writing about this issue: Those who received a good unit that doesn't show the problem and who falsely conclude that is never happens, and those who are having the issue. To see if yours has the issue, shoot a photo of the blue sky, and look at it on your computer. If you see little grey or slightly dark orbs, you have the problem. I originally had zero, then about 5, then it went to over 20 spots. One or two is nothing--it won't show up on your prints or elsewhere. But one or two dozen, that's a problemThe great thing about getting your cameras from Amazon.com is you can return/exchange it for another unit.

This has been said infinite time already all over the Internets. I will keep it short: Amazing dynamic range, Great low light performance, terrific handling, Exceptional speed, Brilliant time lapse functionality. I am coming from a D90 which I used for almost 4 years. So those are the awesome things about this camera.Now why did take away 1 star?1. Dust issue. I started noticing spots on the left upper quadrant of the picture after shooting about 4000 pictures. I blew them away from the mirror and sensor using a Giotto's rocket blower. It has reduced quite a bit and I have shot another 3000 or so after that. I didn't notice the spots increase in quantity or density. Before I \"dry\" cleaned it with the blower, I started noticing spots at around f/10. After I cleaned it with the blower, I still notice a faint spot or two at f/10 and that gets worse as you go narrower, obviously. But I can say one thing. Dust has STOPPED accumulating after I cleaned it with the blower. I was changing lenses too. I was out in the desert (Arizona, Utah, Nevada) for a week shooting landscapes and changed lenses quite a few times. I have a feeling that once I send it to Nikon and get it properly \"wet\" cleaned, I am confident that it won't recur. Also for my personal use, I pretty much shoot portraits so I rarely go over f/5.6 so it is really a non issue for my needs.2. 1/4000 shutter speed limitation is my second concern. I thought it probably would be ok but I found myself in situations where the camera needed at least one stop faster shutter speed even at f/16 in bright sunlight. I ended up bumping up the ISO to compensate for that. But I felt frustrated at times by this limitation. This is really a not a BIG concern but just a minor annoyance.Also, people complain about 1/200th sync on this body. My D90 had the same sync and it never bothered for my photographic needs. 90% of my portraits are natural light and I pretty much shoot Aperture priority at f/5.6 or lower. Since I rarely use flash sync speed is not an issue at all for my photo needs.Time lapse functionality is AMAZING.Bottom line, if you are like me, you won't regret this purchase no matter what people say.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "OIL SPOTS RUIN PHOTOS", "Author": "Herbert D.", "ReviewID": "RLVY0WDAVT0CK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to travel to South America.

I loved D90 but moved up to D7000 for better low light capability but D7000 to date has a focus issue that I hate to admit, and of course Nikon never owned up one bit.Now I paid 2K with the 24-85 lens deal and am shocked and surprised that spot/dust issue persists. I tried a lot to make up my mind to keep it.. but it's getting worse. One spot has turned into two..Is this sealing issue, oil issue.. I din't know . I just put on single lens and that has stayed in place.. how could these giant blobs be getting inside my camera? And of all the places on the sensor !!! #1 job of camera is to click pics and  if it can't click clean pics what can it do ?I will be returning mine and keeping D7000 and this hurts.Some additional thoughts given I am current D7000 user, and just sold my D90 in anticipation of me moving to full frame :1. D600 really really just feels like a D7000 in mos tregards (even IQ IMHO)2. Focus points are all stuck in the middle of the sensor even though the sensor is huge given full frame3. Have see better low light performance in D600 as compared to even D70004. More megapixels are good as you can crop much tighter after the fact.5. Overall my D600 is either overexposing or underexposing at the exact same settings with flash on when compared to D7000, could be a camera specific learning I need to work on, but did not see much IQ improvement I was looking forEdit:Greeko - I am now more and more convinced that:1. Problem is with all D600 units as mine was ordered on Dec 28th, received on Jan 2nd, it took only about 150 pics for nasty spots to show up2. I got suckered into the \"deal\" with the 24-85 lens, which is no longer available.. in part making it emotionally difficult for me to agree mentally to send the camera and lens (+128 GB Card + WU-1b wireless unit) all for 2K + tax.. But the good thing for you is that deal isn't available anymore so easy decision. That lens also BTW is only 3.5 - 4.5 much worse than the 17-50 2.8 Sigma that I keep on my D7000 all the time.3. I will be keeping my D7000 and 3 othe rlenses that I as about to put on e Bay - 17-50mm 2.8 Sigma, 50 1.4 Sigma and Tamron 90mm macro..4. I am clearly disappointed, and pretty shocked at Nikon trying to hide this under the rug.. come on Nikon, own this and we will buy this again and love you like we have for years.. otherwise I am not sure I will be able to keep my years of loyalty intact.5. Technology is advancing, and I really think D90 was the last good camera Nikon produced. Time has come for me to start looking, D7000 is barely acceptable with it's focusing flaws. I tried D600 and is being sent back now.When Nikon sold faulty focus D7000s and I said it's bad people told me \"it's higher level camera.. your technique must be wrong.. blah blah blah\" but in the case of D600 there is not a single person who I know owns this camera (3 of my friends/colleagues) who have not had the spots start showing up sooner than later, and we all know what is an acceptable speck of dirt vs really bad blotchy spots..

The big one was the oil spots on the sensor, which began showing up on my photos fairly quickly.  I also noticed the menus/photo review freezing periodically, especially when trying to zoom in.  My D600 also had the tendency to overexpose (sometimes severely) in all modes but Manual. I usually shoot in manual mode anyway so this wasn't a huge problem for me, but might be for others.

I was not afraid because I rarely use aperture beyond f11 and also because I had experience wet cleaning DSLR sensors (which is easy but requires patience).  My D600 arrived on Dec. 20, exactly a month ago.  Its serial number is 3039xxx for those who are interested.  The dust spots appeared as expected (sounds ironic, isn't it?), at less than 200 shots, but I knew it because I looked for them shooting the sky at f22.  They have never been a real issue in my photos because I have shot mostly indoors stopping to at most f4 and my outdoor shots were at most f11.  Today it reached 1100 shots and I started to clean it.  It turned out that all the spots I had could be blown away using a rocket blower and wet cleaning was not needed!  Other than this \"internal debris\" issue, the camera is FANTASTIC, as has been said by many reviewers.Some people may use f22 because their composition requires it.  But f11 has been good enough for most of my need.  For example, at 24mm on a FX camera, the hyperfocal distance at f11 is 1.75 meters.  This means if I focus at this distance, anything between 0.9 meters (3 feet) and infinity is inside the depth of field.  So f11 is enough unless I want something less than 3 feet away to be in the depth of field.Clarification added after seeing the first comment on my review:  I did not justify using lower f stops.  Rather, I was just stating I do not use >f11 often and when I would need it.  So the defect is a minor issue to me, but D600 offers great features otherwise and thus is worth the 2K I spent on it.  I did not elaborate on the features because many other reviewers already covered them.  The dusts can be a serious issue to some people, and I was trying to help them by providing my experience and serial number.  If this defect is important to you, you could always buy a different camera or move away from Nikon.Update on April 6, 2013:  I checked the sensor at about 2300 shots and did wet cleaning as blowing was no longer sufficient.  Checked again at about 3400 shots, again blowing was not enough and did another wet cleaning.

The last time it was in the shop (just got it back 1 week ago yesterday) they also replaced the shutter mechanism.  The service order came back stating that they had also \"checked and cleaned\" it 4x.

I lost count after a couple dozen of them.  I did a shoot yesterday that was with isolations on a white background and I literally had to spend about an hour editing out the spots on just 1 image.

I got it with the Nikkor 70-200m f/2.8G VR II and have taken just over 1000 shots so far, all in the beautiful snow of the NY finger lakes. I have owned several DSLR's and SLR's before, but this is my first full frame DSLR. The photos with this wonderful camera and this fantastic lens are magical. I am still really a brand new user of the D600 and will update my review when I really put it through its paces, but I just wanted to post this quick impression because I am so delighted. Also I have tested to see if I have oil on the sensor problem with the shots I have taken in the pure white snow covering most of the frame, at f/2.8, and I cannot find a single flaw of this nature. I am using Lightroom 4.3 to view and adjust my NEF images. Reports suggest this is an out of the box problem, so I will hopefully not have this problem. I did also get the kit lens and I have tried it and its OK. I will be replacing it with the Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8G shortly. I also have the Nikkor 50mm f/1.8G which is absolutely excellent and I look forward to using it with this full frame camera. I did also get the wireless adapter with the camera which works well enough and will be useful under some circumstances. Overall I am delighted with the D600 and although I was prepared to return it in favor of the D800 if it did have the oily sensor problem, it does not. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a full frame DSLR. Do be prepared, as I was, to buy the fantastic FX glass that Nikon makes. I highly recommend taking advantage of the discount offered by Amazon in buying such lenses at the time of purchase of the camera. Also look out for the special offers like free SD card and backpack. I did not see this offer and did not add the free items to my cart, so missed out. Not a biggie since I have 95mb/s SD cards and an incredible case in the form of the ThinkTank Sling-o-matic/30. My review is to be continued and I look forward to testing out the video even though this is secondary for me.Update: 12/29/12OK, I took more shots at f/14 to f/22, again with the Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G VRII. With a white background I DO have dark spots in the same places on every shot. These are clearly caused by sensor contamination. Out of the box the camera cap has been off no more than 6 seconds for 2 lens changes. This is unacceptable for a brand new $2000 camera. I will be returning it to Amazon as a defective unit and will change to the D800.Update: 12/31/12I just want to close off this review by saying that Amazon have been very good regarding the return of this camera. Of course they are paying for return shipping on the camera, but they are also paying for the return shipping of accessories I bought for the camera, supplied by other companies. They are not required to do this but have agreed to do so without hesitation. I have already ordered the D800 and it arrives on Jan 2nd. This camera had better not have any left-wide focus issues or I will drop Nikon and sell all of my lenses. Good luck to those who stick with the D600 and start cleaning the sensor of an out of the box camera. A great camera that will eventually be produced with the levels of quality expected.Update 1/13/13I received my D800 to replace this D600 10 days ago. All I can say is thank god the D600 was faulty. I would have never tried the D800 and for about $700 more it is superior is almost every aspect. Sure the memory cards cost more and it will eat up your disk space faster, but in every way that matters to me the D800 blows the D600 to pieces.

For me, the AF coverage is not a concern - I never want the camera to focus on the tree at the edge of my view finder when I wanted it to focus on my subject in the center anyways.Here are the issues:1) several dust and oil spots showed up after a few dozen shutter actuations for me. Visible at F11 and above. No surprise there2) color is waxy-yellow under indoor lighting. This is a WB bug, in my opinion3) kit lens (24-85) focuses very slowly compared to competition (the excellent Canon 24-105f4 L)4) cannot lock focus in dim lighting condition (this is expected since D7000 shares this issue) and yet can take good pictures at high ISO - this is a contradiction in design consistency.In short, the best part is the sensor and ergonomics.

After reading the reviews it seems like there have been quite a few issues reported with sensor being dirty (dust or oil): either right out of the package or after shooting some photos. Probably what's happening is excessive oil from moving hinges inside the camera (shutter) deposits on the edges of the sensor and then attracts dust. While this shouldn't happen out of the box to a high end camera, and Nikon should make modifications during production to minimize the issue, don't dispair...For anyone owning a DSLR, I would suggest investing $50 in sensor cleaning swab/liquid/brush kit....Regardless of whether Nikon employees over-greased the damn levers or not, if you are a heavy use of any camera, learning to clean your sensor periodically will ensure crisp clean photos. It's very easy to do. Google \"DSLR sensor cleaning solutions\" and you will see videos of how it's done. Very, very, very simple...and you should be set to go....as for voiding the warranty, don't be scared...it's no different then cleaning your inner mirror or lens...If you put a scratch while cleaning either one of these, you will void the warranty as well...but if you do it carefully and follow basic instructions, you'll be fine....I periodically (every 3-4 months) clean the sensors on my cameras. A lot of times I'll visually check for dirt/dust just to make sure I am OK.... In the case of the D600, at worst case scenario, once the excess oils have moved out (usually happens the more you use the camera), you'll probably not have the issue of constant spotting....and then all you have to do is simply maintain a clean sensor...As for Nikon, they are better off finessing their production line to not over grease the shutters, and they will avoid a lot of insult and refurbishments... it's really sad to see their great technology get overshadowed by shoddy workmanship.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, but had dust issues", "Author": "NickH", "ReviewID": "R1TKAOA9532G7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Switched from Canon to Nikon for this camera.

In use this means you cannot count, in advance, on enjoying the potential of the sensor because you will not know until after taking your picture, sometimes in unrepeatable circumstances, if the sensor is clean.  In short, you can't count on its potential being there when you need it.  You can clean up the image after the fact, but that means your time is being spent because some design engineer or quality control process did not do its job.  I don't see comments about other Nikon full frame products or those of its competitors receiving similar complaints about oil spots on sensors.

I performed a wet cleaning (very easy to do) and was able to remove all the spots. So far, after another month of normal use, my sensor is staying clean without any new spots.I believe some D600's were manufactured with excess lubricant. The problem has been reported to go away after about 3000 shutter clicks, since the excess lubricant eventually drys out. Note; not all D600's are impacted.

Also, the D600 has the video option (not in the D700) - which is a great added feature to have in case you need it...I live in northern NY where it is cold and snowy right now, so I am limited to a few inside test shots. So far the D600 and 24-85 appear it's going to be a great all-around FX combo, and I don't regret buying it, even with the internal debris issue - I do see a couple of spots after I looked for them after taking 1200+ shots. They show up pretty distinctly at f/22 in the upper left of the image. I'm going to shoot a couple more thousand shots and see if the problem worsens, and even it doesn't, I'm going to send it in for a cleaning. For my hobbyist shooting, if the problem doesn't become worse, and even if I don't get it cleaned, I can live with a couple of unnoticeable spots as they are - I've never shot at f/22 in my life, and most of my shots are cropped center.From my limited shooting, the camera itself, and the lens, so far seem great. Everything an all-around FX package should be. The camera produces sharp, great color images and is loaded with every all-around feature that shoots 24m images - which makes this a very attractive product, at a great price, for the average hobbyist like myself. I'll probably sell the D700 even though it's a great camera because the D600 covers about everything I need and so far it appears the IQ is near equal, or better, than the D700 - especially in terms of color/white balance. The high ISO is great with the D600 as well - anything 1600 and below looks clean like 100 or 200 ISO.

In the beginning, when I used the camera with Tamron lenses to take event pictures it did its job. The quality was superb and the colors as well as the focusing capability were excellent. All pictures were done in aperture of f 3.5~6However, recently I went to New Hampshire with the camera to hike the Lafayette Mountain. This time my main focus was to take excellent landscape pictures. In aperture of f11 to f 22, the pictures I thought they were perfectly focused and framed were filled with complete flaws when I checked with photoshop and lightroom. I saw numerous dust spots on the left corner of each pictures, and the focus was all over the place. Given the fact that there were lots of fogs and clouds as I reached the peak, I understood that sometimes it was hard for camera to decide what objects to focus. However, I was really shocked to see consistent dark spots at the same location of each pictures.It has been over a year since dust/oil problem has been numerously addressed by thousands of customers and yet Nikon did not fix this problem.This shows that they do not give a s***t about the customer's concerns as well as their reputation.I am planning on returning D600, Tamron 24-70 3.5, and Nikor 85mm due to this issue.

I shoot hundreds of photographs every day, and I use all of the features on the camera. In other wods, I wanted this camera for very specific reasons, and I did my research before hand. I was definitely aware of the well documented 'oil sensor spotting issue' with the D600, and I did everything I could to find a camera that did not have this problem. Now to the meat of the review... No matter what Nikon (or Amazon) tells you, this camera is inherently flawed! I have been through FOUR of them, and was assured that the 'later' releases do not have the sensor oil spotting problem. Guess what - they all do!! It is a flaw in the design of the D-600 that Nikon refuses to acknowledge; and, it WILL occur in the one that YOU buy. The first two instances happened after 300, or so, shutter activations, and showed significant black oil spots in the upper left hand corner of every photograph taken after that. These D600's were replaced by a reputable camera store. I decieded to buy the next one from Amazon, because I reasoned that Amazon's high turn-over rate almost guaranteed that I would get a 'later model' - i.e., one that did not have this problem. Wrong again! The next one (from Amazon) had the same issue after about 450 shutter activations, and this one was graciously replaced by Amazon. The fourth one from Amazon did not evidence the problem until around 2000 shutter activations, but the problem became progresssively worse than the first two, and only showed up after it was too late to send it back for replacement. It is so bad that I will have to edit 'black spots' out of over 1400 photographs from a recent shoot before I can consider using any of them. Not what you expect from a new $2000 camera! Also,  Nikon's customer service is everything that you might have already seen in other reviews - absolutely terrible!!! They will not acknowledge the problem, nor can they tell you that they can fix it. Nikon certainly will not offer to help you in any way, other that what is explicitely written into their warranty. This has been the biggest dissapointment, because I have always considered Nikon to be the standard of excellence for photography. I have literally been without this camera for almost three months trying to find one that works. I had to send my 'new camera' back to Nikon for repair, and it has been there for over two weeks waiting on a part (for a brand new camera!) and they cannot tell me when I might be getting it back. Be forewarned, or take your chances... I was told that this problem was fixed months ago - and, it was not. I bought into the D600 hype, and quite honestly the price point for a full sensor DSLR; but, in allshooting  modes it is only slightly better than the D-7000 in quality. At $2000, it is border line fraud to represent this as a camera for any kind of serious photography. Here is the real problem: if you have planned your conversion from a DX to an FX format, and you have accumulated a few high end Nikon FX lenses, it is a very expensive comittment. 'They' effecively own you then! Don't do it!! To unload all of that equipment and find something else can be equally, if not prohibitavely, expensive for most photographers. Even if you find yourself in this position, do not buy the D-600. Give up some resolution and get the D700 instead. Me, I am unloading my Nikon gear, and going with the Canon when I get this piece of junk back. I do not intend to take the chance that this problem will happen again (which I am convinced that it will). I suggest you save youself the frustration and buy the equivelant Canon model from the start. Canon does not have this problem, and Nikon is not the company they used to be. By the way, the only reason this gets even two stars is that I love the shooting control layout. But then again, I have always shot Nikons...until now. Oh, and if you are willing to gamble on Nikon's warranty work, please contact me and I will make you a great deal on a very little used Nikon D600!!!Amazon, you should take this camera off your product list until you know that this problem has been fixed. It has to be costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars in returns, not to meantion the potential damage to your stellar reputation!

There are two parts to understand, the camera itself, and the issue plaguing majority of these bodies. The first body I had was bought in September 2012, and after buying, I immediately went on an international trip, which was going to be several months, since the body had just come out, and as I was traveling I had not heard about the sensor dust issue. I was shooting away and it was all good. At one point in time I was attending, the Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix 2012 (I'll be attaching a couple pictures), and I had tickets for all three days, being with a new camera I wanted to test it out and see how the system worked with Sports, given the camera has an unusually small AF area, if you compare it with a D7000, even the D7000's coverage is better, but I usually use the center focus point, and I dont mind that too much, but thats just me, some people use all focus points and for them, this is not exactly the best focusing system, in fact this is in my opinion is the biggest downside of the camera technically, which could be a deal breaker for some people.Anyway coming back to the grand prix, so for those 3 days, I used the camera on Continuous high speed, which was using burst of 10 pictures or so, throughout. I got a satisfactory enough keepers, which kind of also proved for me that the camera can do pretty decent in situations such as one I went though. However once I went home and started looking at the raw pics is when I realized the horror, at that point I had clicked about 4k Shutter actuation's, about 3k in the 3 days of grand prix shooting. And almost every picture was bloated with dust and oil, the final pictures I decided to process, were in hundreds, and I had to spend time for each and every one of them, the fact that cleaning out those dust spots is not necessarily easy when they are so many of them in each picture. This is when I googled and realized whats has been happening with the D600. I had a macro lens and I immediately took a picture stopped down, and I couldn't believe how dirty the sensor was. I immediately took it to a Nikon service center in New Delhi, India, I was charged about $15 and I got a clean sensor back in half an hour, I hoped that would be the end of it, but it was not the case, after a few hundred shots the sensor was getting dirtier again. And this is when I decided I couldn't keep this body. I immediate spoke to Amazon, and they were ready to take it back, once I was back in US. After coming back and reading about how the D600 sensor issue was probably non existent in newer bodies, I decided to order again around New years, but unfortunately I got another body plagued with the same issue, I have now decided that, I'll be returning the D600 for a D800, although it doesn't necessarily fulfill all my needs, and it might come with some AF issues, however Nikon CAN fix that, and I probably am going to get it fixed, but in the case of D600, Nikon has been completely mum, leaving a good majority of its owners in the dark of any development what so ever, this is very cruel to me, if I hadn't invested in an Nikon ecosystem of lenses and flashes, I'd have walked away Nikon.Leaving the dust issues aside, the D600 is an awesome camera, Dynamic Range, ISO performance, resolving power, and ease of use. Keeping in mind this is not a professional grade body, the cameras controls are very nicely aligned, and having a D7000, it was great to jump onto the slightly bigger body with slightly better ergonomics. If the camera bodies I had used were not having any dust issues, or if Nikon would have owned up to this issue and perhaps suggestion a future fix, I'd had given the camera a 5 star rating, but with my experience so far, its going to remain 1.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very impressive", "Author": "dr. lowbrow", "ReviewID": "R37I7N8JTG5XDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a D200, skipping a generation of Nikon digital SLR's, so this was a massively huge upgrade for me. Still, I could use most every camera function out of the box (I'll need to read about and practice video, if I want to use it). The controls feel sturdier and easier to manipulate, though that is probably due to only small changes. I wanted the D700, drooled over the D800, and immediately opted for this one, which is 2/3 the price of the D800.There is more plastic in the D600, but I have to admit I am happy for it because the camera is so much lighter than even the D200. I am not hard on my equipment, so I am not worried about the bumps and bruises that might affect this body more than the D800. Something to keep in mind, however.Photo quality? It is everything I've dreamed of. With my 50mm 1.8 I can shoot almost anywhere. ISO 6400 shows its grain, but I mean really! ISO 400 had much worse quality in the D200. A very nice addition to the shutter options is \"Q\" for quiet. Now with the high ISO and Q mode, I can shoot at classical concerts with a little less concern (watch the percussionists and shoot when they cover the shutter noise).The advancements in focusing are excellent. It is easy to switch between modes and even to select the exact focus spot (a subject's eye). The viewfinder notifies you when it reads the spot as focused. I've found it very accurate.I wasn't sure if I'd have use for live mode, but it is amazingly effective for shooting my dogs. I can drop the camera to their eye level and still see what I'm doing without getting on the floor.I haven't taken it through all of its paces, but my impression after a week is extraordinarily positive.

I'm a Nikon user since 1978, having the FM, FE, N6006, F100, D50, D300 and D700 cameras.I bought this camera from a local store. I tried it with my Nikon AFS 50mm f/1.4G and it seemed to work fine. When I got home and mounted the Nikon 24-70mm the autofocus start presenting erratic behavior (the lens works fine in my other cameras); the autofocus didn't work about 50% of the times the shutter was pressed. I tested all different AF modes and tested with other lenses, and with an AF-D 28-105mm the camera very often showed the f-EE information on the display (the aperture ring was set to the smallest aperture and locked). Looked like a communication problem between the camera and the lenses. I tried to rotate the lenses a little bit clockwise and counterclockwise to reestablish the link, but it didn't work out. I returned to the store, they confirmed the problem and replaced the camera with a new one.At the counter, I was handed the new camera by the store employee and I tested the autofocus extensively with a range of lenses and it seemed to work fine. When I got home and turn it ON, I felt a great resistance on the ON-OFF button when sliding it from OFF to ON (but not on the opposite direction). I'm used to Nikon \"feel\" on the controls and this one is very different even from the previous D600 that I had just returned because of the autofocus problems. It seems like something is not correctly assembled below the ON-OFF button and I don't know if its about to break or not. I'll probably return this one too.I had never any problem regarding Nikon's product quality since 1978, but for the last week, the two D600 I tried had some evident manufacturing issues.

I somehow found  the last credit card not yet maxed out, and bought the D600.The D600 arrived on Christmas Eve, with free shipping, 60 day return policy, no tax - Thank You Mr. Crutchfield.I've read the user guide before, and we have an older Nikon D70, so about 10 minutes after opening the box I was able to attach the lens, install the battery, set the aperture and ISO, I even removed the lens cap, and started firing away.Early next morning, after only 100 photos, I had the oil spots.BUT: Without reading the Amazon reviews, I wouldn't have noticed any of it.Yeah.  Aperture F22, manual focus, shot of the gray December sky had about four gray spots in the left upper corner, the same place where they supposed to be. Nikons are reliable, after all, the spots are always in the left upper corner. Shooting a white wall in the living room, the same result.By the way, these are not large black spots, but more like a light gray, almost translucent, and quite small. I got lucky; my camera probably received less grease by the factory than others.What about the other photos?  Any spots? NOPE.  The other photos were to die for.  I like to leave the camera at F 7-8, and play with the ISO settings if the shutter speed gets to low.Some of the D800 reviews (which has 36 megapixels) often mention how difficult it is to obtain sharp photos when the D800 is handheld, unless the shutter speeds are kept relatively high.  I didn't experience this on the D600 at all. My best ever was a 1/3 second shot, hand held, came out just fine, using the kit lens with the WR on.I don't want to repeat the love stories we can read  here, they are all true, but the one for me is the ability to crop.  Take a landscape shot with the wife walking in the park, crop it down to 1/12th of the original picture, and I get a great, sharp portrait of  her.  The 24-85 zoom lens is great, but I don't zoom much at all, most of the time I leave it at the wide end,  and finish the composition at home on the computer.The 2nd part of the  love story is the viewfinder.  We have other, easier to carry or use cameras, but every time I pick up the big DSLR I'm reminded that there is nothing as good as an old-fashioned, optical viewfinder.As for the oil spots, by now the camera has more than nine thousand photos on the shutter, and the spots didn't get any worse, nor did they go away.  If it gets bothersome,  I can afford to clean the sensor in a local camera shop, and pay for it, because the D600 is worth spending some extra cash on.Other: there is a submenu which shows the battery state of charge and the number of shots taken since the last full charge.  Because I have a 2nd battery I went all the way out to drain the first and that battery gave me  over 1,200  shots, after messing with the back monitor and review the photos often.  With a spare on hand, I think I could easily take from 2,500 to 3,500 shots on a single day without the need for a recharge.I compared my own photos to the downloaded images from the D800 and there is a difference in the D800 favor, but he D600 comes in close, especially in the hands of a better photographer.Other: we never print anything.  For me, no print can trump the images on our 27-inch monitor.And here comes the catch: when we first started using our previous  Nikon D70 I wasn't impressed with the images, as seen on the old 19-inch monitor we had back in that time.  We bought other cameras, mostly Canons, ( I love our G12) and eventually a better monitor.  When I went back to check some old photos taken with the D70 on our current  27 inch monitor, I  discovered things I didn't see on the 19-inch which had  lower resolution.What I'm trying to say, we don't even know what the D600 is capable of until we check the images on a really high-end, high resolution monitor.  My next shall be a 30 incher, unless something better becomes available by the time I finish with  the credit card payments.My favorite camera, before the arrival of the D600 was the Canon G12.  I didn't realize how much better the D600 is until we spent a day at an AKC Dog show.  We had the older D70, the D600 and the G12 with us.  My wife got tired of the D70, so I gave her the Canon G12 and I had the D600.Next day, checking the photos on the monitor, I had to admit that my beloved G12 didn't even come close the D600 photos.  Yes, there is a huge price difference, but from now on the G12 moves to the role of a backup camera, and the D600 becomes the top dog in the house.My only complaint here would be the D600 doesn't support 16:9 format.  Every point of shoot has 16:9 aspect ratio, which looks best on the new wide screen monitors, but not the Nikon 600.  You can recrop the photos in the camera, or in the computer, but it's a hassle, and the picture isn't the same you had seen in the viewfinder when you pressed the shutter.Nevertheless, like the title claims: My Last Nikon.  At my age, I can't think I'll ever need a better camera.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier -- with one odd exception", "Author": "Word Hack", "ReviewID": "R22ASY64N49KBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are plenty of D600 reviews here already, and they all conform with my experience (except for the dust/oil problem--I haven't seen that yet). I've taken almost 10K photos since I got it in May (overseas trip + sports season) and have few complaints.The one thing that has hampered me a little bit is that the screen is polarized, and my sunglasses (which are expensive because I am so sun-sensitive) are polarized in the opposite direction. This means that the screen is black when I look at it outside. This was not a problem with my D90, but turns into a real headache with the 600. It means you have to shove up your sunglasses when you want to make sure you got a picture (although a lot of time I don't have time to look anyway) AND it means that you must take your sunglasses off when you're doing video because that's the only way to see anything.#FirstWorldProblems, sure, but if you need sunglasses outside, you'll appreciate how difficult this can be.I'll also mention the weight. After carrying this thing around Italy for two weeks (literally in my hand almost the entire time) I picked up my D90 and it almost flew up out of my hand it was so light. The 600 is not so heavy as to be impractical, but be smart about your posture and your strap, and take a break from the weight as much as you can. I had the 24-70 attached, so I just held it by that when walking around Rome etc. so the weight was borne by my arm, rather than my upper back.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Oil Issue", "Author": "Second.Amendment", "ReviewID": "R2YQXZK5986C6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just arrived today and initial test shots look amazing.  I was disappointed to find that on the very first test frame, I saw evidence of the dust/oil issue that everyone has been hearing about.  I cleaned it once and did not have any issue for the remainder of the session.  Do I think a $2000 camera should have any issues at all right out of the box?  No.  That being said, it is an inevitable issue with DSLR's and not something I would have looked for had I not heard so much about it.  I would recommend this camera to anyone, especially upgraders from D7000 or D7100.  These upgraders will not have any learning curve at all.  On a side note, this camera is built much better than the D7000, something I did not expect.  I had heard it was an FX D7000, but there is a noticeable difference in build quality between the two.  If you are on the fence about this camera, you should not hesitate.  Might want to order your preferred cleaning tools with it though, it may need cleaning right out of the box.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A better alternative to the D800...just Amazing!!!", "Author": "deck2c", "ReviewID": "R124AHVFSIEE37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was almost ready to buy the D800 but i thought maybe I should wait for another announcement from Nikon. I'M GLAD I DID!!! The D800 is a beast because of its 36 megapixel image and excellent dynamic range. But personally for a hobbyist, that's way too much of a camera. Also the left focusing issue held me back as well from getting it. If photography is a profession for you, then by all means the D800 is the right choice. And if you have the money, the D4 is another option for you.I owned the D700 and was really happy with it. The D700 I would say is one of the best DSLR ever. I shoot both photos and videos and that's when the D700 put me behind. Almost every DSLR now is a hybrid. If shooting stills, D700 is on par one of the best but not in the video world because obviously, it doesn't shoot videos.Until Nikon announced the D600...I ordered it the day it became available on Amazon. My very first shot from it was at ISO 6400 and I was \"BLOWN AWAY\" on how the image looked nice and you can barely see noise. I told myself, \"If ISO 6400 is usable, shooting between 800-3200 would be excellent\". 24.3 megapixel is just right considering the file size of the D800. The price is more than what everyone was expecting but hey, for $2100 compared to the performance of this camera, its a bargain. Pictures look crisp and clear and the details are outstanding. This camera is very close to the D7000, size and layout wise. The D700 was heavy because of its magnesium alloy body. This does not completely have the full magnesium alloy body but  the built quality is good. 5.5 fps is fast enough for sports photography. And also you can shoot 60fps in HD for that smooth slow motion video. The only down side I see in this camera is it has 39 focus points on a bigger screen and its all crammed-up in the middle of the screen. So if you are shooting portraits, you have to recompose your frame in order to get that focus on the eye of your subject. Other than that, i don't see anything else to not like this camera.I gave myself a tap on the shoulder when I saw the DxO Mark review on this camera. It was second best to the D800 (D800 was number 1 overall). It was even given a higher score than the D4.In conclusion, I would say this camera is a \"must have\" for all hobbyist, serious hobbyist, or someone who is switching from a DX format to an FX format. I won't say this is a professional camera but i see this camera as a back-up to a D800 or maybe even a D4. It has the best of both worlds. I came from a D5000, D5100, D300s, D700 and now this camera and i would say this camera is a D700 on steroids. Well done Nikon!!!", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Camera is Great!", "Author": "G. Hubbs \"Biologist\"", "ReviewID": "R3Z1RCSV7N87J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Despite all the negative remarks about this camera (not professional, oil and dust a on the light sensor, Nikon has dropped the ball), I bought this camera anyway.Why?1. I have known many \"professional\" photographers over the last 45 years and many of them showed me photographs that were incredible AND, they were taken with simple point and shoot cameras.  Thus, demonstrating it isn't always the camera, but what you can do with it that makes the difference.This camera is sharp, clear, and takes great photographs.  As I progress through the learning curve of operating this camera to it's maximum ability, I have seen a big difference in my photos.  I am enjoying the challenges this camera poses, and doing my best to get the full potential from myself.2. I don't care about the oil and dust issues.  Things get dirty.  I have to wash my car, too.  But, cleaning a light sensor is a lot easier and faster than washing the car.  So, I bought a sensor cleaning kit.  I haven't noticed any problems with the camera, yet.  But, I'm ready to take care of business if the sensor shows signs of needing a good cleaning.I find the capability of this camera to be right up there with the best of all 35mm DSLRs.  The focus is super fast, I have fast memory cards in place so, the images are stored at lightening speed, and vibrant color are outstanding.  As I hinted at earlier, there is a bit of a learning curve that goes with owning one.  Don't let this deter you from considering this camera.  Buy a good book that is dedicated to this camera and you will be good to go in no time.  And, of course, practice with actual photo taking.  If you are in no hurry the slope of the learning curve just flattens out.Who would I recommend this camera to?  Everyone!!  Everyone who has a real interest in using DSLR, that is.  Owning and using this camera has been a lot of fun.  I always thought I took pretty good photographs (don't we all?) but, this camera has reminded me that I can be much better than I though I was. In oder to get the most from this camera I have to get the most from myself. I love the challenge.March 13, 2013I wanted to add a few bits of information that I didn't include before.I have a limited budget so, I had to research exactly which lenses I would need the most for now.  I finally decided to purchase two zoom lenses.1. Wide angle zoom:  AF-S Nikkor 16-35mm 1:4G ED VR  I really love this lens. It has been called the sharpest lens, and in my  opinion it is really sharp.  Noted to have several types of distortion but,  this distortion can be controlled with good handling and software  processing.2.  Tele zoom: AF-S Nikkor 28-300mm 1:3.5 - 5.6 ED  VR  This lenses was highly recommended and I felt this would fit my budget.  The lens is sharp, little to no distortion, and has been a  very reliable lens. It is heavy but manageable.  I can hand hold it alright  but, I'm not as rock steady as I was years ago.  On a tripod,  this lens yields very clear images.The light sensor kit I bought (in case I need it) is made by Eclipse. I purchased a kit that contained a few #3 brushes, a couple o pads, and a small bottle of liquid sensor cleaner.  The kit comes in a handy nylon, zippered bag which is easily carried in my backpack.As for the D600, I am going out photographing birds and flowers at this time, and I really like the results I'm getting. The detail of the flowers is incredible.  The birds are harder to get but, the camera has come through with its great response.  The 24mp sensor makes the difference when photographing the birds.  I can't always get close enough to fill the view finder, but I can crop these photos and still have clear and crisp image.***UPDATE 3/31/2013I did notice something on my image sensor the other day.  So, I took the camera outside and  took pictures of a clear sky under the same conditions recommended to search for oil splotches and dust.  And, I found them showing up.No problem.  I had already purchased the Eclipse cleaning system and, spent 10 minutes cleaning the sensor in the recommended fashion.  After testing I found my cleaning had removed the splotches and dust.  Thus, I am still happy with my D600 purchase, it still takes incredible pictures, and I have no fear of oil or dust while I travel.  Cleaning is simple and quick.  I know Nikon should have resolved this issue long ago.  However, they didn't!  But, I don't really care.  I believe we all should learn to do basic things to take care of minor problems like this ourselves. I won't lose a moment of picture taking, nor will I have to search for someone to clean my camera for me.  And, I'm glad I made this purchase.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A worthwhile upgrade from a D90... and ISO 12,800 is quite liberating", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R2MS71O6KENEN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE after four months:  No spots on the sensor, just outstanding images.  Now, back the original review...While comparing these two camera isn't exactly fair I would wager there are lots or people who already own a D90 (or any of the D-thousand series) and are wondering if this camera is *that* much better.After using this camera for a while I am convinced that yes, it is *that* much better.Low light performance is unbelievable. There are lots of \"scientific\" reviews floating around and as a rule of thumb, take whatever ISO on your older Nikon you care to, multiply it by 10, and you will see equivalent or better performance on the D600.  I live in auto-ISO and change the parameters to suit the environment.  Minimum shutter speed is typically 1/15 (1/30 if I've had a lot of coffee) and I raise it to 1/80 if kids are involved.  Maximum ISO is 12,000.  So far the camera has never let me down.Focus and exposure are dead on. Auto white balance is as good as I've seen. Camera \"feel\" (solidness?) is closer to my D200 than my D90.More on the feel, the D600 is described as a mid-sized dSLR. It is about the size of a D90 but a bit larger. It is in the same weight class, but a tiny bit heavier. Overall, it feels quite substantial without seeming heavy or bulky.  If my D40 is at one end of the solidness scale, my D200 at the other (it's a tank), and my D90 dead center, then I would put this half way between my D90 and my D200.  (Hope that made sense; What it means is it feels pretty darn solid.)I also really like the 24-85mm lens which came with the bundle I purchased. It focuses quickly and produces very sharp images throughout its range.To be fair and balanced, there are some negatives... The D600 uses a battery that is different from the D200/D90. That means I have to buy at least one more because it is always good to have spares on hand. On the plus side, there is a retaining latch that allows the battery to drop out easily. On my other Nikons I had to shake the camera violently or bang it against a wall before the battery would drop free. (anybody want a good deal on a used Nikon?).  The battery has also gone 500+ shots and barely dropped below 50% on the in-camera battery meter.  Also, I would have liked it if the D600 would capture five images while bracketing rather than only three (or two using the internal HDR setting). There are some arguments that three is actually better and it is only my personal preference. OK, it *was* a stretch and these about all I can come up with.Bottom Line: When Nikon released the D90 I felt it was a bit of a marketing mistake; too much camera for too little money. While I'm not suggesting this is an inexpensive camera, does provide an outstanding value given the features it provides and the quality it delivers.What follows is a boring detail if you don't already own a D600 and may be a handy trick to remember once you finally do...This has to do with how you can customize the built-in scene modes to your liking.  Some photographers consider the scene modes to be only a shade better than going full Auto.  I'm not one of them.  There are dozens of configuration choices that you make depending on what you are shooting.  You look at the light and subject and from that determine on how you want your camera set.  Setting that stuff up takes time and lots of menu selections.  Selecting one of the scene settings merely loads in a bunch of those presets all at once.  That is a good thing and not to be avoided; it's part of what you paid for.  You can make that even more powerful by first selecting a scene you typically use, for example Portrait or Landscape, loading the entire set of settings into the one of the user registers, and making whatever adjustments you want.  You now have your own customized scene modes that are instantly accessible.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Full Frame Camera!", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "RXMSQEMKMOBVY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the pleasure of using the Nikon D600 for a week now so here are my impressions so far.1.  Although it does not have the same build quality as the higher end Nikon FX cameras it still feels extremely solid.  The build is similar to the Nikon D7000 which I also own and have shot in multiple conditions (desert, snow, rain) without issue.  I'm going to assume the D600 will be able to do the same.2.  It is a bit small in my hands (think D7000) but with the addition of a grip I'm sure that will change.  It's perfect for those who do not want to lug around a heavier pro body FX camera such as street photographers, etc.3.  If you are familiar with Nikon menus and layout then the D600 will be a no-brainer to set up for your personal shooting needs.4.  The mode dial has a locking function as opposed to it's DX sibling the D7000.  I found I would knock the mode dial out of manual quite often, especially when shooting video, so this is a nice plus.5.  There doesn't seem to be any back focusing issues.  I have used my FX glass and haven't notice anything but tack sharp focus.6.  Video quality seems to be on par with the D800.  I'm not sure what the bit rate is but it doesn't seem to compress the footage as much as the D7000 does.  It also has a clean HDMI so that's a plus for external recording needs.7.  The dynamic range of the D600 is unparalleled at this price point.  Noticed a huge difference even when shooting video.All in all the D600 is a great camera for those who have been wanting a full frame body but have not wanted to spend the money in the past.  It is also great for a back up body for those who do not want or need a second D800/D4.The only bad thing is it too has the green tint that the D800 has.  It does not output the green tint to an external monitor (which had been calibrated)  so yes it is there and no Nikon doesn't see it as a problem.  That's is the only thing keeping me from 5 stars.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, dust issue is mitigable", "Author": "Jiaqi Wu", "ReviewID": "RLHPQHDFH213Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great value for a full frame camera. Functionally it works extremely well. If you are worried about the dust issue, I will say that yes it will probably happen to you. I bought a refurbished model and it still happened to me. However It is only a temporary issue that will go away after a couple thousand shots. My advice is to watch some youtube video and learn how to clean your sensor with a proper swab and fluid as it is not very difficult (takes 2 minutes). If you have steady hands, you will not run into issues. If you are uncomfortable with this, pay somebody to do it. After your photos start getting dirty, clean your sensor.

It was very annoying.I took it in for servicing. Living in Vancouver, I didn't even have to ship it, as the Nikon repair store is a short drive away in Richmond, and I dropped it off. It was ready for pick up the day after (thank you NPS!). Not only did they clean all of the dust out of my viewfinder, they actually took the precautionary step of replacing my entire shutter unit, all for free!

Good thing too, cause I was pushing 70k shots when I returned it for servicing.I'm not 100% certain about this, but the D600 that are being sold right now may not suffer from this issue.

Meaning they seemed written in a language that touted things on the camera I didn't even understand. I wondered if it would be too much for me, a non-pro, to handle. Or would it just exceed all my expectations and make me understand what all the hype was about as well?I jumped. It exceeded expectations. If it broke next year I'd buy the same exact camera. I doubt I'll want another camera for years no matter what the future ones do. Just take a photo of something that appears, to your eye, to be lost in shadow and watch what this does, for example. It astounds.When it came time to pick a new camera that is more current (you can buy an optional piece for this and it will wirelessly upload photos to an iphone or ipad not only for editing, but to share on social networks, with friends and family, on blogs etc easily) I was a bit overwhelmed but I do endless research before picking any expensive new item and no matter if I was reading photography magazines, consumer reviews, or professional reviewer's reviews it seemed everyone was literally blown away by this new Nikon. Best Buy sold out right when they brought it in. I've personally owned many Nikons over the years. When I was majoring in art at college my photography professor raved about Nikon bodies and lenses and I fell in love right then. I've upgraded a few times but none held a candle to this one.This Nikon puts many things that were formerly only in bodies twice the price or twice the size into this compact (well, compared to many pro cameras at least) body. Many pro writers of camera reviews actually rated this far above those 2-3 times the price so I mean that literally. The one mention that interested me the most was its' ability to perform well in low light. I always had a huge flash on my other Nikons which doesn't make for easy travel and while I have no doubt a professional likely still would, for me I wanted to be able to use the flash on the camera...as long as it worked well, without attaching one. I took photos yesterday in a building with no windows and only indirect light and the room looked incredibly well lit. In fact, I've been taking endless photos everywhere. I took photos in a CAVE and it lit up. That was a huge test. (This wasn't a place I'd normally take a nice camera...but it's in my backyard! Oddly, we own a cave.)And I see why in my research for this camera that I just couldn't find a hater among any professional reviewer at the time. Everyone seemed to say it outperformed cameras they couldn't dream it would outperform.It seemes to have a bizarre mind of its own it's so good.Yesterday I wanted to take some product photos. I've done this many times over the years but the comparison in color was just amazing. I couldn't take a bad photo.What the non-pro will love is the camera thinking for you. The past Nikons I've owned all had a few \"scene\" buttons...Not only can you do some manual things or put the camera on automatic, but you could get more specific and pick, for example, \"portrait\" and get soft lighting and a focus on the person yet soft focus in the background automatically...well this has those buttons too but Nikon has expanded the buttons so literally anything you want to take a picture of you have no need to think about the lighting, the focus, the aperture, or the shutter speed to get the best effects...because the camera will do it for you.SCENE SETTINGS:Let's say your dog is doing something really funny...pick the \"pet portrait\" scene button and you can easily capture fast movement yet a soft focus background.If you are a food blogger or simply want to capture your Thanksgiving meal you just made, choose \"food\" and you get very well lit, bright photos just like you see in magazines. Incidentally, if you are taking a picture of something that you want to bring out the colors of and it's not a well lit situation or you want the colors to even appear richer than they are, this is a good button to use even if it's not food because of what it does. I consider it my \"vivid\" buttonChoose the \"child\" scene if you want the above vivid colors in the clothing and the scene but soft skin. Seriously.Pick \"landscape\" scene for landscapes in the daylight. This is another favorite of mine because I consider my backyard the prettiest spot on earth at times. But mainly it's an easy button to keep on when you travel and get all the right shots and I have an upcoming honeymoon which is why I chose the new camera in the first place.Pick \"sports\" for fast shutter speeds and to freeze motion...if your kid is playing football or soccer and you don't want them to be a blur in every photo, you can actually capture them all day long in freeze frame. Have your kid jump in the air and get amazing shots...it freezes the action without you having to think about setting the shutter speed or ever even needing to know what shutter speed means. This setting allows you to take continuous shots right after each other. Set the camera on continuous release mode with one click and instead of taking single clicks it does the fast shots just like the pro sports photographers without you ever having to learn a thing about how to do it the pro way.Pick \"close up\" for close up shots like a bee on a flowerCapture NYC as you see it...Pick \"night landscape\" and you automatically reduce noise and unnatural colors normally seen in night photos. Take a picture of a neon sign with this and then with most other cameras and compare...you don't get the noise and blur around the lighting. Street lamps and neon and lights in windows against the night sky are suddenly clean and beautiful.Night portrait is just the opposite. It gives the person in the portrait main focus but the night lights and objects are in soft focus behind them.Have the lights out and your kid is blowing out the candles on the cake? Choose \"candlelight\" scene.Want to take a picture of a black item with a black background? Choose low key. White on white kind of purposefully washed out? Choose high key\"Autumn colors\" brings them out best.\"Blossum\" is your setting for that field of bluebonnets.If you want to capture birthday parties, game nights, and family events, you pick \"party indoors\" and suddenly Chuck E Cheese's place looks way better. Actually anything indoors does. This is like the \"food\" button allowing indoor things not to be tempered with poor lighting but it can be used for far away objects and the whole room whereas the \"food\" button is better on those close up pictures like the plate in front of you (although it works fine for most far away things too. I use both of these a bunch)Normally light reflects off sand and snow but this camera won't allow you to have to sit and think about how to fix it. Just put it on \"sand/snow\" and it fixes it for you. It captures the brightness of outdoor white scenes well but doesn't over illuminate anything either. I have a huge wall of white limestone in my backyard that I used this on as well.Typically dusk and dawn are ruined even on auto exposure on cameras. You have to learn how to capture them and even then it's hard and most cameras make the flash go off just because it's night time and the effect is lost. The \"dusk and dawn\" setting preserve the rich colors in the weak light of dusk and dawn and turn the flash off automatically\"Sunset\" preserves the deep hues so you can finally perfectly capture the scene and the flash stays off\"Portrait\" makes the person in sharp focus but the scenes behind them in soft focus and their skin soft. If you want this look, like I used for a piece of fruit hanging from a tree, in other things you can use it as well...anything where you want the main item to be sharp in focus and the background to be in soft focus works.Now that may sound like lots of buttons but the above are not buttons at all. You just turn the dial to \"scene\" and then when you push the \"info button\" you can pick which scene you are photographing...and it keeps it there until you change it. So, for example, if you are traveling and it's going to be outdoor landscapes all day, you just keep it on there and don't think about it until you feel like turning the dial to the dusk button and then the sunset button, for example. You can go back and forth from the auto button, for example, to the scene button all day long and it will remain on your last chosen scene.Sure you can play with shutter and aperture or keep it on auto but this does even more thinking for you. For example, keeping it on auto also means the flash will go off anytime it's low light. But choosing \"sunset\" means it will adjust its settings to preserve the colors and also not wash them out with a flash.So, this makes the camera amazing for pro OR novice. I felt a bit worried it would be too \"pro\" for me in reading the reviews because it appeared to be the only people who were buying it...I wanted the best but I didn't want something I couldn't use because I'm not a pro on any of the latest camera bells and whistles. It turns out it's very user friendly but the book brings clarity in one day to all it can do just by reading it. It's like pro camera class in a few hours time so nothing is left out. Sure you can just read one chapter but you can honestly learn the whole camera by reading the book. For example, if you read the pages on \"high dynamic range\" (HDR) you discover that if you are taking a photo of something that has high contrast like a building that's black marble against a white sky, you can set it on HDR...It will take one photo that focuses on the dark details then a second photo that focuses on highlights and combine the two together so you see every last detail in the building. Something like that is not going to be used in every picture but it's thinkgs like this in the book that make it interesting. You can also use it to make creative shots like taking a photo of \"Big Tex\" then the Ferris Wheel at the Texas State Fair. What you wind up with is a super cool shot of them both combined and overlapping in one photo. I choose this example because I actually won a photo contest once when I did just that...but that was a far more complicated process with an older camera. This makes it something you don't have to think about.You'll also learn other things like time lapse photography that breaks it down into simplicity...so I do suggest reading things like this in the book. The camera does so much that you'll wow yourself with what you have when you do and you'll surely miss out if you don't.There is even a setting that allows you to take pictures QUIETLY if you are sneaking photos in those \"photos prohibeted\" spots. Yep it does. And it has a setting for \"flash prohibited\" spots too you can set it on so no flash goes off no matter what. Like in a theater and Broadway show.Have bad eyesight and can't see the focus bracket? This camera does so much that you can actually adjust THAT. You move a dial until they are in full focus on the disply as seen by your individual vision. That's what I mean about finding out all it does...I'd never figure that one out on my own without having done some reading.Incidentally, I highly suggest getting the camera body WITH the 24-85mm lens. Especially if you aren't a pro who wants to be swapping out lenses...this way you get close up shots and full-room shots without missing a beat and just turning the lens dial. You are also in charge of cropping your own shots before you upload them because you stand wherever you want and then crop what you want by turning the lens rather than walking forward or backward etc. Plus the VR in this lens means \"vibration reduction\". If you are in car using your Nikon or on an African safari in jeep you set it on vibration reduction and it actually takes that into account to still give you great shots!While I got this primarily for the camera, I have to say the videos are equally as gorgeous. The Nikon lens is so great and the video capability so crisp that they are the best I've personally ever taken and I've had some great video cameras before. Plus having it built in is just amazing for travel or, I'm sure, kid's sporting events or a wedding. The things you want a video of like the toast you get, then the still photos you get as well. With just one camera.One really awesome camera.Is it \"a bit much\" for someone who is a non-pro? It can make you feel like one and certainly take pics like one and as an artist, my camera has always been very important to me...It captures life and art and things like my honeymoon I can live through forever with great photos so it's an expense that is one I deem \"worth it\"...it turns a hobby into pure bliss.

This was an upgrade from a D300. I have created about 6000 images with it, almost all using Nikkor 17-35 2.8 and 70-200 2.8 VRII lenses.Using this body I see much more striking differences between the images with the pro lenses and the images I got with 28-200 VRII Nikkor on the D300. Actually, I did not think the pro leneses were worth the weight on the D300. Images from the D600 have more definition and better color, particularly at high ISO and so I've given the 28-200 VR II away. The D600 is much stronger at creating attractive images under cloudy conditions. In bright sun, the gain from the D300 is minimal, but on a grey day, the D300 tended to produce flat images with little contrast (and, just be be clear, I never shoot with my WB set to \"Auto\"). Grey day images from the D600 are frequently beautiful.I took the camera to Antartica for ten days: loved the low light sea shots I got. Maybe the best test was shooting albatrosses and petrels from the fantail of a ship tossing in 10-15' swells and a 30 mph wind in the Drake Passage. The birds move fast on that wind and you're getting tossed around on the ship. Working with the telephoto lens, shooting a 1/4000th of a second at F2.8 and pushing the ISO way up while shooting against heavilly overcast skies, I got superb images. Folks around me shooting D7000's got nothing to compare.So that's all good news. The other good thing is I have not seen any of the dust and oil problems that I read about in other reviews, fortunately. But the Sub-command dial started acting unreliably after about 3000 images, and I found myself with some annoyingly complex workarounds during the Antarctica trip to manage camera options. The dial gave up the ghost the day before I came home. I had some mechanical problems with my D300 when it was new as well. I have had a parade of Nikon film body experiences going back to the original Nikon F and I never had a film camera break with less than ten years of use. Manufacturing in Thailand may save Nikon money, but their quality control seems inconsistent with their pricing.I sent the camera to Nikon and they returned it saying there was nothing wrong. The Sub-command dial worked for one setting and then died again and I sent it back to Nikon. This time they acknowledged the problem and I am waiting for the return. That's why this is not a five star review.I am confident I can get five star images from the D600 (although you need the right lenses to get the best out of this camera and others in its price range).

I just got back from ten days in Istanbul and started noticing that on shots of sky and open spaces that in the upper left corner there was a spray of \"blobs\" .  Thinking it was dust, I locked the mirror and used a rocket blower, but to no avail.  It's not dust, it is oil.  I did not buy my camera through Amazon as I have in the past, I bought at a national retail camera shop.  I am taking it back for cleaning (on their dime, believe me) and if it continues, I am going to insist on a new camera.  I'm hoping it is just excess oil from production and then once cleaned it will be the fabulous camera I know it can be.  With the exception of the \"blobs\" in the upper left hand corner of some photos, the camera is amazing.And for the reviewer who thinks that those of us calling it oil really mean dust, um, no, we do not.  We all know what \"sensor dust\" is.  It's that stuff that blows off.  This is oil. In a new camera under warranty you don't screw with it.

Sturdy build", "Author": "rodrigo", "ReviewID": "R2Y57KGK7XAN3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review from a semi-proI am an architect and complement my work with architectural, product and event photography. The reasons for getting this camera were:1. Low light photography2. Dual SD slots3. Upgrade to full frame from DX4. Build quality5. Dedicated settings buttons6. Price point7. Want to be able to crop liberallyI would personally recommend this camera to:- People who are getting serious about photography who want and can afford an FX body- Upgrading from DX and have FX lenses to migrate- Pros who want a second body to complement their set-up.Definitely not for:- Beginners who've never used a DSLR- People expecting lightning fast auto-focus in low light- Want to print larger than 60x40- Will never shoot in any other mode but AutoWhat you need to get started- Reliable SD Card, at least 30mb/s speed (some would say 45mb/s but I'm ok with 30). I rather get a bit slower 32GB card than a faster 16GB, but it all depends on your needs.- Good FX lens, if it's your first FX I would suggest a fixed/prime lens with nice big aperture. If you already know your needs, get either a zoom, macro, wide angle etc, but a good 50mm is never wrong. Good all around lens, light and fast for all day shooting.-  Lightroom/ Aperture are a must. If you are contemplating this camera, and are reading this, you probably already use one. Noise reduction, contrast, exposure and cropping is basically what I do. But the organising of my files is the real winner here.+So let me start off by giving you my experiences in a nutshell. My first DSLR was a D60, then upgraded to D7000, and began investing in used \"older\" lenses, which to my surprise are FX lenses!  Let me just say that obviously the D600 blows the D60 out of the water. There is just no comparison. The D7000 on the other hand is a good companion for the D600. For me both cameras are study enough to carry and shoot all day, comfortably with a fully charged battery, and solid 32GB cards.The D600 performs better than the D7000 in image quality, colour rendition, low light, usable images at high ISO. Subjectively I would say the D600 produces crisper images that  seem very vivid. The D7000 doesn't fall short though, but now that I've had the chance to test both. I would pick the D600 any day. For its price range, there is just no comparison. It is almost a steal.  This camera very well position between the D7000 and the D800.Body build is just perfect for me. It feels light enough to keep with me. Have taken my camera rock climbing, to the beach, bars, clubs, stadiums. Have bumped it, thrown in my bag, on my front seat. And the camera has now scratches or anything. Its nice they include a screen protector, which now has some scratches mainly from my stubborn use of my shirt as a cleaning cloth. It has all the right buttons that I need, ISO, image quality, live view, AE lock and focus modes.The picture mode dial lock needs some time to get used to, but now it's second nature to me.I decided to pick up a 50mm 1.4  and go back to \"basics\". Forcing to compose with my feet, enjoying the beautiful bokeh at 1.4, excellent results in low light. It served me well for 2 months and then decided to use my old 70-300mm and my 55mm micro. Both perform very well. Camera exposes and meters with no problem.-I honestly have nothing against this camera besides the very well known dust-oil issue on the sensor. I was hesitant about getting this camera because of that, so many reviews, making it a sure thing on the D600. I was naive enough at first to believe my camera had no such issue as I couldn't see any spots at F16. After a week, some spots were noticeable. After a month, the spots were very clear at F5. So yes. There is an issue. Nikon is this the quality we should expect from a $2k camera? Please tell us if that's the case, because customer service will surely act like it's the very first time ever they've heard from it, and of course will do nothing about it. Amazon takes the crown as they do quickly send you a replacement (friends got this camera after they saw mine, ran into the issue and had em replaced). Not me. I knew that wouldn't change a thing. The issue IS REAL, however, I got myself a wet sensor cleaning (copper hill images, amazon has em). It was my first time ever cleaning a lens. Followed online videos, took like 15 seconds of my time. Repeated the process twice before I tested. And what do you know, the spots were completely gone. And I mean, COMPLETELY gone. Will they come back ? Of course they will. But I have a pack full of cleaning solution, and all it takes is a full battery and 15 seconds (it doesn't justify it but I deal with it). My advice don't send your camera back, or take it to a local shop. I personally don't trust it. Just learn how to do it yourself, but still give Nikon a piece of your mind.ConclusionI still fully support this camera, and here I am sharing my thoughts. Absolutely love it. Have captured wonderful family moments with it, that are worth well beyond the price tag of the camera. If you have any questions about it, please comment and I will gladly answer.If you made it this far, and are still hesitant about getting it, I would say, go for it!", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade from D7000, but mine had the spot problem.", "Author": "kevin", "ReviewID": "R250LDLSJXM2R8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The D600 takes great pictures, but the spot problem kept getting worse.

I was lucky to have only suffered about 1-3 spots and can clean it out, but it keeps returning. Nikon hardly acknowledged this problem until months and months of selling the D600. I have yet to verify if there was ever a fix for this.2. The \"fix\" is a new model dubbed the 610 with like 2 features that differ from this model but everybody knows its all about the fixed shutter to prevent spots. The value of the d600 has dropped and if previous owners want to trade, its gonna cost another $500-1000. Might as well have bought a d800. Real smooth business there, Nikon. Though my problems are minor compared to others, it feels like D600 owners have been rubbed the wrong way. I have concluded I will not buy another Nikon and am considering jumping to another brand. Just because of this.3.Crippling features that gives the D7000 an advantage over this camera such as slower flash sync speed, slower max shutter speed, and slower continuous burst rate. Why did I trade it?Ironically though, the body is built well. Mine feels more solid than the D3000, D5000, D80, D90, and D7000.*the potential for good image or video quality is pretty much ruined by spots. I start seeing them at least around f/5.

It's a great camera for masochists. I do love my camera, no argument there, I just disagree with Nikon's direction in handling this whole fiasco. Bad business. Shame on you, Nikon.Final thoughts: Due the announcement of the D610, the price of the D600 has dropped dramatically. Therefore I cannot get any return value for my camera, and realized it is literally a dead weight. In an effort to get something for it, I have listed it on ebay as a paperweight for about 1/1000th of the price.

They replaced our first one without any hesitation, and we got it overnight. They had UPS come and pick up the old one - we didn't even have to tape the box up.Unfortunately our second camera has spot issues as well, although not quite as bad. The Camera Concierge team recommended I either return it, or get Nikon to clean it under warranty.

I finally decided that the D600 was more suitable to my needs. My last bone of contention was about Auto FP.  I really like this feature on my D300s and did not want to give it up on a full Frame DSLR.  I could not find it as a feature on the D600 Searching write up after write up and watching all the You Tube videos and others I could find.  Nobody talked about Auto FP on the D600.  Ok so I decided to live without it.  Well guess what the D600 does have Auto FP. If you are not familiar with this feature it allows you to sync a compatible Nikon flash at any shutter speed up to like 6400/sec by pulsing the flash as the shutter curtain moves across the film plane/sensor (ever need high shutter speed and flash like at a concert at night). Well Auto FP is a great way to shoot.  The 5 frames/sec is ok but bogs down a little shooting large images and or while using flash but considering the amount of information that needs to be processed plus flash recycle time it's ok. My D300s at 7frames/sec does this with no problems (so I got spoiled).Picture quality is incredible in FX mode and in DX mode matches the results close to my D300s. However, I did not buy this camera so I could shoot DX but it's a nice option to be able to use my DX lenses for some shooting situations.With the controls on the camera body, it's easy to quickly change shooting settings and you can customize pretty much every setting, color, density, contrast and sharpness. This gives you almost limitless possibilities for your picture preference.I was never much for in camera post processing; however the post process features lets you get really creative. I especially like the selective color option (I actually bought the D5100 for this feature in its effect shooting menu).  Doing this post process makes this really less tedious and with the filter effects I may never have to buy another lens filter.One of the reasons for my choice of the D600 over the D800 was weight.  My D300s is a fabulous machine but lugging it around all day is sometimes not fun. With the full magnesium frame on the D800 verses the combination magnesium and plastic on the D600 (lighter weight frame), I opted for the latter.I'm not a professional Photographer and will not be taking the camera into combat, so I am ok with the lighter body.  It's plenty sturdy.Chasing the flight of marauding sea gulls the 3D tracking is right on (fast and accurate).  That Nikon decided to use an existing DX sensor array (prolly to keep the cost down) so that all the sensors are in the  center is not really an issue since I rarely want to have my focus point to be at the edge of my frame.  If I do, I focus, lock and re-compose so not an issue for me.I only have 3 lenses I can use for full frame (FX) photography, none of which have a VR feature.  So I was anxious to see how that would play out.  Well so far I am pleasantly surprised that they offer good balance and see no bad affects from camera shake which were evident with my DX cameras.  I hope that is real and not me having delusions of grandeur.  I really dislike the bulk those optical stabilizers and little motors add to my lenses (hmm maybe if they could add a sandwich a cup of coffee).I am not into videography so even though the choices for video on this camera seem awesome, I don't know if I will ever use them. So, I have no comment.  I wonder if Nikon would consider making the D600S without the video feature... heay just sain.Anyway, I am totally delighted with my D600.Hold the presses:My current photo edit software will not open NEF RAW files from the D600... I contacted Adobe... You will need Photoshop CS 6 or Adobe Lightroom  4.2 or newer. Adobe (to what I was able to understand) is not planning to offer a plug in to accommodate Camera RAW 7.2 or newer.  View NX2 (comes with the camera) Will open the NEW NEF D600 files however not a full feature RAW editor.  I found an article that says CaptureNX2 software (watch out ..( It has to be version 2.3.4 or newer I guess) to deal with these RAW files but when I look at adds for Capture NX2 they say they support Windows XP and Vista (NOT Windows 7 or 8) It may mean it does not support 64 bit systems.  There is a 60day free trial on NX2 but the Adobe stuff says all sales are final.I did find a free one from NCH.. PhotoPad Image editor (has some short comings for this but kinda works).  I actually checked this out cause they had the solution for my Nikon Video files, which I could not open/edit with my usual software (not free but works great). You can convert the D600 NEF RAW files to TIFF or PNG... and work from there.  I guess the tools will come along eventually.  I do not plan to throw  the baby out with the bathwater.  Anyone who would like to shed some light on this for me, I would appreciate it.A short Update...After using my D600 for a while a did start seeing the dreaded oil specks (cringe). Anyways I watched some Youtube video on how to clean a sensor. I bought a kit and cleaned it. It was easy and it worked fine. I have read about so many people sending the camera back and getting a replacement or sending it out for a pro cleaning (which if I read them right is very expensive). Seems sooner or later you will have to clean the sensor. Sending it back seems kinda like returning a new car cause you saw a little oil on the engine. Anyway, I'm still loving this camera. Bought Adobe lightroom (you need Version 4.3 or higher to handle the D600 RAW files. Not to expensive (works good) and now shoot mostly RAW with no problems :)", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from D7000, pleased so far...", "Author": "Brian \"bravotangofoxtrot\"", "ReviewID": "R4T4OP2FEHPKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the D600 a few days ago and I have been very pleased with the camera's performance.  I upgraded from the D7000 and I think that has made the transition very straight forward.

I think the camera feels fine.  I know some have commented on it being plastic in some parts and yes, it does not have a heavy metal feel, nor does it have that weight either, which I find nice.  I think as composite materials become more common place such as graphite and plastic hybrid materials, people will be more accepting of them.  Even with the D600 materials, the camera still feels solid for me.  The picture quality is very good.  Just the same, I thought the D7000 took excellent pictures too so I wouldn't expect a significant increase in picture quality from the move to the D600.

I'll spare you my best fantasy camera reviewer language (you can read that anywhere else) and just get down to ultimately what really matters. The quality of the pictures. In the end, you want the best camera as a tool to do what you want the camera to do. I love low light concert and nighttime photography, a chance to tease out details in shadows, a challenge to get the tonal ranges right with deep shadows and spotlight hotspots. I'd do that with a $300 point and shoot if I could, but not just any camera can do that well.The D600 delivers in this challenging aspect of photography. I shot a major concert on Friday night. I set it on tracking focus, stopped the lens down to 2.8, ISO less than 800 for most shots, even a shutter speed higher than 1/250 of a second to lock the musicians in crisp focus. Delivered great, editable JPGs with no noise. No color casts. What you see is what is shot pics.After a concert, i'll wade through 150 images shot with my 70-200 2.8 lens and DX body. I'll  keep less than 10 that actually turned out. (You know the drill, open light room, auto-tone, suppress the snot out of the noise, etc.)  I overshot on friday--150 as usual, but am now having to decide how to pare down 90 great looking photos-right off the card-- choosing the best composed shots, not just limited to the ones than turned out in detail and focus I never thought possible with my old camera.Before you buy. Think hard about what you want your camera to do for you, because just as there are many tools for different jobs, there are camera options and lenses for different types of photography. If you are a camera snob, stick with the D800/E. (I have an old medium format film camera for those occasions)  If you leave the camera settings on auto, can't read the environment to adjust for challenging shots/wring every last detail out of your frame, or no interest in this type of photography or don't make it a priority to learn how to hit all the notes with your camera--stick with a DX body SLR or a good point and shoot and save your money. My old used D80 with a 50mm 1.8 lens could be had for less than $500 and lock my kids into crisp focus with good indoor lighting.BUT--if you are looking for a D700 replacement to get printable, framable results in challenging situations (i'm only keeping the tripod for video recording) or want it without forking the extra $1000 for the D800, place your orders now.

Comparison with Fuji X.", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "ROH2LTPSL89CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Three notes; comparison with D800E, with D3200, and with mirrorless half frame such as Fujifilm:1. So how does the D600 compare with D800E? Two months ago I was able to try out a D800E and saved many shots at various ISO. When I received my D600 this week I was able to compare directly, closely duplicating the previous scenes, with the same lens (105mm VR). High ISO noise reduction was OFF for all shots. Results: At ISO 6400, the D800 image is distinctly less noisey, and also punchier, with better color contrast and clarity. Comparing at ISO 100 and then again on a third scene at ISO 800 there is very little difference between 800/600 except of course in pixel density. At ISO 1600, the noise is comparable but D800 is beginning to give noticeably nicer contrast. Also the D600 produces an odd texture on greens. So, D800 is a higher performance sensor at very high ISO - as one should certainly expect for the price. Under more typical conditions, there is little difference. As for resolution, I think most photographers know by now the difference between 24MP and 36MP is not going to be realized in handheld photography anyway. For the ultimate in low noise and image contrast at high ISO, D800 is slightly but definitely superior to D600. But it should be; for the difference in price you can buy a nice lawn tractor. Comparing the D600 with itself at various ISO, if one looks closely there is a bit of noise beginning above ISO 400. Please note that all my comparisons were JPEG's; I don't yet have software for raw D600 files. The D600 appears to be based on the D7000 half frame, so all the focus sensor points are clustered towards the center, but I did not find this to be a problem. On the convenience side, the D600 has almost all the options of D800, including Autofocus Fine Tune, while being noticeably lighter and smaller. Both D600 and D800 have the MyMenu feature; Instead of plowing through the endless complex of menus to make any change, I can set up my own custom menu with up to 20 items selected from all the standard menus and leaving off things I use rarely, if ever. Note: D600 should be used with VR lenses or you have no hope to get 24MP out of it at ordinary shutter speeds.2. Five stars for the D600 as a sweet spot in the Nikon line for those of us with a drawer full of FX lenses. However, the photo market has changed significantly in the four years since the D700 came out and the rational photographer should consider the alternatives. A few years ago full frame digital, if you could afford it, was head and shoulders above anything else. This is no longer quite so true. I was able to try out a D3200 recently, Nikon's newest entry level half-frame DSLR. This was a quick test, but enough to see this is the real bargain - at 1/4 the price of D600, 1/6 the price of D800E, amazingly good DX sensor, photos at lower ISO quite striking, and about half the weight. Entry level DSLR is a very competitive market and Nikon tries harder to offer value there than for the lower sales volume full frame. Even advanced photographers shouldn't turn up their noses at D3200; unless you're firmly committed to full frame or need the dedicated buttonss, D3200 is a steal. Yes, D800E is state of the art and D600 is close - but neither of these could be said to be five times better than D3200.3. The second big development in recent years is the advent of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras. I still strongly prefer a DSLR vewfinder to any other kind - have tried electronic viewfinders but just do not like them. Also, the familiarity of the Nikon interface is a big plus for me. Nevertheless, I am aware that lots of advanced photographers are moving to much smaller and lighter half-frame mirrorless cameras like the Sony NEX and Fujifilm X series. As the art of making sensors continues to develop, the quality gap between full-frame digital and half-frame digital is becoming smaller. Particularly for the Fujifilm X series, which I have tried, the sensor is truly impressive. One recent online review even reports that the high ISO images from Fujifilm half-frame are slightly better than full-frame D600! If true, quite remarkable.The D600 takes lovely photos. Today I went to a farmers' market in a neighoring town and shot baskets of fresh radishes, beets, squash; the images on my computer screen glowed with smooth bright color.I have not stopped shooting since it was delivered. But at the same time I can see it being perhaps my very last DSLR.  The D600 with 24-85 kit lens weighs 3 lb 2 oz, even more when I mount one of my two other FX VR lenses, 16-35 and 105 macro. Things are changing in photography, and we are close to the point where one can get beautiful images without needing such a big heavy camera.

The battery to me seems to hold a lot of charge, no scientific tests made but I did not notice any unusual power drain so it is perfect.The indoor photos look very good given the great iso performance of this camera and I really like that I am able to lighten the raw format photos to my desired levels in post processing on the computer without giving up on quality so a lot of information is stored on the darken/shadows part of the image, which is very good.The focus points are concentrated more towards the centre of the frame, I would loved to have them across all frame but then again I mainly use single centre point for focusing and then re-framing before taking the picture so at least for me it is not an issue. Nice to have feature but not really missing it.I really like to have 2xSD memory card option, browsing and scrolling in camera to various parts of the image is very fast, a feature I use a lot and disliked on the old Nikon D80. The video, I did not use it too much but the quality seemed very good so far, nothing to say here.Now I did give the camera only 4 stars because:When I got the camera I did not care much for what all the people was saying about the dust on the sensor on the internet but after less than 1000 photos I started to notice a lot of spots mainly in the upper/left corner of the photos where the blue sky is which were taken using f/9 more or less.I then decided to go back to the store with the camera, they decided to send it by post to Nikon Munich and before weekend was back but unfortunately they only cleaned the sensor without trying to address the problem.So now, I am a little over 1500 photos and if I really try to find spots on the sensor by taking pictures at f/22 on a white wall I can notice a few spots in the upper/left part of the image and some around the edges of the photo (lower/right, lower edge) but in normal use you do not see them. Trying to blow them off with a camera sensor blower/cleaner didn't work. I still have the spots, and I will delay a little returning the camera since I want to see if more appear, I will eventually send the camera back for cleaning/repairing a second time.Despite this dust problem, I think I would still buy this camera again first because it is not possible to get a better price/performance ratio than from this one and then because it just takes stunning images, really. If you are comfortable in having to send the camera back for cleaning/repair because of the dust problems I recommend it, otherwise probably look elsewhere.

Was hoping to drive my D200 to the ground, wait for it to die before I upgraded. That didn't happen and then the D800 came along.Long story short, I was seriously considering an upgrade to FX/D800 and the CMOS sensor to justify my larger investment in prime FX lenses but the price of the D800 seemed too steep. Furthermore, as most of my photography is exclusively travel and mountain landscapes, I wanted to move away from the heavy, bulky body of the D200/D800 likes. While they can take a huge amount of abuse, there is something cumbersome about handling them in tight corners and long walks.Along came the D600.Its light, its fast, the FX has breathed new life into my FX lenses and after the few comparison shots I took with my D200, I had a stupid grin on my face the whole day.The dynamic range of the sensor is a whole new world compared to the older D200 sensor and the FX lenses are a joy to work with. I have a whole new reason to shoot photos at any given chance simply because the results are just glorious. I hadn't expected this level of performance.Yes, the body feels 'smaller' and slightly less rugged than the D200/D800 but I welcome that, Its just easier and less'in-your-face' when shooting on travels.

Here is initial feedback and some drama:1) I dropped the camera TWICE on a hard concrete floor, first time it fell out of my camera bag (3-4 ft fall) because the zipper was open and second time it just simply fell out of my hands when I bent to grab something (8-10 inches fall). Needless to say I was almost inconsolable at this abuse to my new camera. However, it survived BOTH falls with NO real damage! I'm amazed. It fell HARD and luckily both times it fell on the corner where the battery goes into its slot. There is a small scratch there and the battery cover jams a little when opening but other than that, no broken plastic and no changes to any functions. I did not expect it to last. Thinking back, I would have liked *just* a little more height to the camera, the D200 fits a little nicer in my hands.2) The images are beautiful, the dynamic range still amazes me3) I have some gripes about the 39pt autofocus system, I'm used to single point focusing and then holding the focus while re-framing the shot. With autofocus on complete auto, I was fidgeting and eventually turned it off. It might be useful for sports and wildlife photographers though.4) Auto-ISO, don't like so much either. Although the high-ISO performance is fantastic, I've turned this to manual as well. When I need it, i'll turn it back on.5) Battery lasted about 500-600 shots, I suspect i'll need backup batteries for my longer adventures.6) It eats up SD cards; I found myself having to clear out my 8GB SD cards on my laptop 3 times that week. I'm used to the D200 8GB cards lasting waay longer. But then, you get 24MP images so this is a bit of a captain-obvious statement.7) Only 3 frames for bracketing, this is a bit odd but then you can bracket on exposure or Active-D lighting or ISO. have only tried exposure bracketing so farStill many options and functions I haven't tried out.

I bought my first D600 body around October last year, right around when they were released. I used it for about a week and suddenly, the shutter would not close completely when I clicked the release button. Needless to say, I had to return the camera. B&H; shipped me my second unit in about a week. All was great... until I took some pictures and saw dust in the images in post processing even when I didn't take my lens out during any shoots. All spots were localized to the top left corner. After a little bit of internet searching, I realized that I was not the only one with this issue... After using the camera for about 2 months, I sent it back to Nikon for sensor cleaning. Nikon returned the camera in about a month claiming that they had cleaned the sensor. So., I started shooting again, after about a week... It is important to note that I only have one lens - the Tamron 24-70 F/2.8. I seldom remove it from the camera. After reading about this issue, I was extra cautious never to remove the lens out in the field.So, three weeks after Sensor Cleaning #1,  I started shooting with this and 100 shots into it, the sensor dust re-appeared at the exact same areas. They just seemed to increase..So, the camera was packed and shipped back to Nikon Customer Service for cleanup #2. I got the camera back after 4 weeks. I didn't use it for about a month. Took it out after 45 days, after around 200 shots...the wonderful pattern appeared again! They were back! Same spot, same pattern... I sent it back again to Nikon for cleanup #3. This time, I called them to see what was going on. They advised that during cleanup #2, they had changed some assembly behind the shutter mechanism with the hope that the issue would be resolved. And that this time around, they were trying something new - and also that they were waiting for a spare part - scheduled to be delivered in August!So, in the 9 months that I've had this camera, it's been sent back to Nikon three times. Nikon wont send a replacement and still insist that they can fix this..In a nutshell, the camera is great, it's an engineering marvel with an annoying defect that was not caught before release - the shutter assembly leaks some kind of 'stuff'!! Everything else about this camera is great. Build Quality - Great Image Quality - Great AF and Metering - Great Look and Feel - Great Ability to make people switch over to Canon - Great!In retrospect, I took the 'early adapter' risk which I probably shouldn't have. But then, I've used Nikon equipment for over 15 years and they have never had issues like this. So, it's odd that a company like Nikon would release a high end product without sufficient quality checks.My advice to anyone considering to buy this. Answer the following question:a. Do you really need a full frame?b. Do you really need a Nikon full frame?c. Are you really good at removing dust specs in Adobe LightRoom?d. Are you in a budget and cannot spend more than $2K?If you answered YES to all of the above, this is the camera for you!Happy shooting!!", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "great prosumer/photojournalism camera", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R3HJ74DOZHEGOW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I am a student. I do photography as a hobby--a project off to the side of my school work while away at college. I photograph for the local newspaper and for student organizations. I made the unlikely journey from the D3s, which was more than I needed, to the Nikon D600. And to say the least, I am extremely glad I did. First off, I bought the D3s under the impression that the camera body is everything. Without a professional camera body, professional-quality pictures simply cannot be taken. This is dead wrong. Lenses are what make or break good images. So, back to the story, I purchased the D3s after the D800/D4 was announced because what I was truly waiting for was a second generation D700 (which never came) and I was fed up Nikon did not have a true replacement. Once the D600 was announced, I hastily sold it, purchased this camera body, then used extra money from the sale of the D3s on Nikkor lenses. The first on my list was the AF-S Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8G ED.I can say without a doubt, the D600 is a fantastic camera. The controls are easy to use. The autofocus system is predictable and the perfect match. While the autofocus points are clustered in the middle as some reviewers have stated, the autofocus points (and the AF-lock button located on the back of the body) eliminate the need for a wider autofocus cluster. And if it is really that much of a problem (perhaps if one is using f/1.4  or faster glass), just manually focus, because at that point, you are probably just taking portraits where a shallow depth of field is needed and the focal plane can be controlled. Do not hesitate to buy this camera. Coming from a D3s, the body is not everything. Sure--it can make a difference. But what really matters is your technique, the glass in front of the sensor, and ultimately one's own creativity.

I got an incredible package deal from a major NY online dealer back then. I think the dealer's name begins with a letter B and ends with an H. I really like the clarity, performance and features. However, I did notice some, but not always, spotting on my photos. Minor really, but a little annoying to clean up post production. I have my camera set to clean the image sensor at start up and before shutdown. So I noticed several forums and sites, including Nikon, indicating D600 owners to return their camera body for factory warranty service. Remember to log in and register with Nikon first and then print out the service form. Although my D600 wasn't always showing spots, I sent it in, what did I have to loose, except the 1 way FedEx costs to Los Angeles ($14-$15apprx I'm closer to the west coast). On a funny note, I wrote on my request that it was oil/debris spotting and got an acceptance email noting that it's not oil, uh OK so it's not oil. It took about 7-10 days to get it back repaired. I've probably shot about 500+ photos since and it's been all good, no spots, no problems. Yes, the way it should have been from the start. Here's the best part, since the D610 just came out all of the D600 are heavily discounted or sold as refurbished. Just as Ken Rockwell (pro reviewer) said, buy a D600 at these prices while you can, so I did. Under $1500 for my second body. I now have two full frame FX cameras that are essentially the same as the D610 at a much lower entry cost. I'm sure Canon may have gotten some new users due to all of this bad publicity, but where are you going to find a 24+megapixel, 5 fps, full frame, full HD video capable camera at this price under $1500??

I got up to about 1500 images with no oil  303xxxx serial.  The 305xxxx seem to be the least likely to have the oil issue.  Overall the D600 didn't feel like a major upgrade from the D300S.I thought I wanted a lighter smaller body, but after using it I preferred the D300S and ultimately D800.  The D800 doesn't cost that much for what you get.  (1/8000th shutter, 51 point 3D focusing, built in viewfinder cover, superior traditional button layout with dedicated WB/ISO/QUAL/BKT buttons, and better live view.)  Live view turns out to be a lot more useful than I had previously thought.  Since we end up peeking at our pictures nearly every time anyway why not just shoot with the screen.  Make it nicer and LED so it doesn't wear out the batteries.  But most importantly the D800 focuses faster and the dynamic range is better.I quickly added a CF to SD adapter so that I can use two SD cards.  There are A LOT of negative reviews stating problems that have simple workarounds to them.  The D600 has a VERY quiet shutter and the D800 is louder than my D300S.  This didn't and wouldn't even really bother unless I had read it in a review.  (chuckle)The higher megapixels is not wasted because I will be shooting FX and DX.

Even when it focused quickly the lock was delayed.  Since you always have to recompose due to the smaller grid layout, this was futile.  I can't believe more people aren't noticing this.- The small cluster of focus points was very annoying- The orientation of most buttons compared to the D70, D200 and previous D300S was VERY frustrating.  Nikon ergonomics is what I'm all about and combining features on buttons with as many are as available doesn't make any sense.- The function button just below the lens is difficult to reach without looking.- The center dial button doesn't always work as the OK button which is pretty annoying on all new Nikons.- I wish I could assign the metering mode dial to another function because I have spot setup on a front function button which is pretty slick, and I can leave matrix (one of my favorite Nikon features) on.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Graduated from D90 to D600", "Author": "sharpshooter", "ReviewID": "R3C8KV3I2MMF9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera a few days back.

Over the years I kept buying newer bodies and lenses primarily because of the weddings, event photography and calendar work I have done.  My latest Nikon was the D7000 which having used the D100 and D200 was an improvement in many ways.  I decided to buy the D600 mainly because I have a large mix of AF-D, G, and DX lenses plus an array of older AI-S manual focus lenses.  The D600 can use them all.  I have read many reviews and can say that AF is faster than the other bodies I have used and in my landscape shooting the metering is phenomenal.  Files in both RAW and JPG are very high quality and you can tweak the settings in the camera and for the most part if you use settings in the Menu such as Landscape you get JPGs you can use right out of the camera.  I prefer to work in Photoshop so I leave the camera settings neutral/standard and have no problem getting RAW files that with a minimum of PS work can be printed at 16x20 or larger with stunning quality.  What does the D600 bring to the table that DX bodies don't?  Mainly being able to use any Nikon MF or AF lens (with the exception of the earlier non-AI manual focus lenses) and getting so many features at the same time.  There is no doubt that the quality of the files and therefore prints, etc., that you can get from this camera in all reality exceeds what 95% of us, pro or advanced amateur, need for our work.  If you already have a top quality body like the D7000, D5100 or the newer D5200, and already have DX lenses you may want to take a deep breath and fight off the urge to plunge into the FX world.  Take a look at the output you are getting and realistically evaluate your needs.  If you are using any of the later DX bodies to their utmost and really need the extra file size and capabilities of the D600 full-frame body then you can't do better than this newest Nikon entry.  BTW, I bought my body from Amazon in late December and have experienced no issue whatsoever with dust or oil spots already on the sensor or any new ones coming on with my use.  And I have lots of shots with open sky and light backgrounds that would show the spots if they were there.

If that weren't bad enough, Nikon still pretends that this isn't a problem, even though they've introduced a replacement camera, the 610. Worse, they imply that it is a user problem. I would avoid the 600 and not trust Nikon on anything. They've lost all credibility. The 600 is largely unusable unless you want to risk damaging the sensor, which might be okay because the camera is basically a $2000 paperweight.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "NIKON NAILED IT AGAIN WITH THE D600", "Author": "P.

I grabbed my D600 a week ago and will continue to update my review of the camera.Initial impressions of this camera is excellent. I am surprised at how much lighter and smaller it feels when I took it out for casual shooting. To have a robust 24 mp, full frame camera with amazing image quality that at the same time is easy to bring about is just great. I am starting to realize it's a great backup camera to my heavier DSLRs as well with its competent image quality and full frame sensor that works well with all my full frame lenses. My wife, having owned a D5100 for a year or so, is still adjusting to the weight but she loves the incredible bright and big viewfinder, faster frame rate and the clear, easy-to-see 39 AF points as some of the upgrades over D5100 (D5100 has these little tiny red dots which sometimes she has difficulty seeing).This thing is built well, with partial magnesium metal body like the D7000 and all that plastic to save weight. It's perfect for amateurs who takes real good care of their cameras and dont really bang it around like the fast-action professionals do. It inherited some goodies from the D7000 and the D800, and it's priced right in between making it such an excellent package. It has the custom U1 U2 settings from the D7000 which store COMPLETE user settings, allowing you to switch between customized shooting modes without the need to play around with a lot of buttons and menu digging (since it also has less buttons than D800 and D4). It also has a decent frame rate similar to the D7000. Some stuff from the D800 is the nice 3.2\" LCD and the AUTO ISO sensitivity feature which adjust the ISO based on your focal length, incredibly useful for mid-to-telephoto zoom lenses such as the 70-200mm 2.8 VR II (camera shake and motion blurriness from hand held shots gets more obvious with longer focal lengths and heavier lenses). The upper mode dial also gets updated with a lock with prevents accidental switch between A, S, Auto, M modes etc. It shares the exact same battery as the D7000 and D800, which is great because I can share all batteries and chargers between these bodies. The D600 feels fast just like the D7000, not crazy fast like D3S or D4, but fast enough for most photographers. I actually felt my D800E is sluggishI have yet to do AF fine tuning on the D600 on my lenses. After a few days of shoot, I think the D600 has pretty accurate AF. I need to fine tune them to be perfect but at 100% you can tell its AF accuracy is pretty close even in high contrast scenes. The details obviously doesnt rival the D800E, but it's not a lot of difference for anything other than 100% pixel peeping. High ISO performance is good, but my initial impressions are that it's a bit less capable than the D800E. You will be very pleased with the high ISO performance if you are coming from a DX sensor DSLR. But for a 24mp I expect it to be better than the 36mp D800E, but it doesnt appear that way to me.I feel the power switch of the D600 is a little firmer to turn on and off than a D7000 or D800, not sure if that's a good or bad thing.The size of the D600 14-bit raw files are about 25-30mb, not small but definitely a lot better than the 44-50mb raws that I have been getting from the D800E.Some cons of the camera, which I find as something quite minor, are as follows:- the AF module inherited from the D7000 is for a cropped sensor DX camera, so the 39 AF points are really clustered in the center, so you lose a lot of the boundary focus points like the D800 and D4 (OR EVEN THE d700 d3s d3). I typically focus then recompose, so this does not bother me as much. But you might find this annoying if you like to compose using boundary focus points.- the flash syn speed is 1/200s vs D800 and D4's 1/250. This is really minor, and even the Canon folks have been using 1/200s syn for a while so I dont know if this will actually upset anyone. The D600 does have high speed syn with SB, so that's a big plus for using Nikon speedlights in the day. Most lower end DX cameras do not have this feature, and it really cripples the use of day time flash.- the max. shutter speed is 1/4000s vs 1/8000 of the D7000, D800 and D4. This might annoy folks who like to shoot wide open at F/1.4 in bright daylight, but then there are ways to get around it such as shoot in the shade, get some filters or polarizers or simply shoot in softer lighting.- in the movie mode live view, you cannot adjust the aperture (if you use the latest AF-S lenses without an aperture ring). You have to switch off live view, adjust the right aperture and then switch it back on to live view. This might annoy some videoshooters. I don't recall my D800E having this problem- I have read rumors of D600 sensors easily catching dust due to a leak somewhere, I have yet to test it myself and update later.- dual SD cards are slower than the fastest CF cards, but they are accepted more easily by modern laptops and saves space. If you dont shoot at full speed all the time and jam up the buffer, you probably wont be bothered by this- 2k pixel RGB sensor of the D7000 vs the 90k ones from the D800/D4. I have yet to see differences in real world applications regarding thisAs of today, I start seeing a lot of used D800s selling about $2300-2500, both locally and online. For another $200-300, you might be able to get a used D800 (and I think that is a terrific deal), if that's the kind of camera you need so definitely look into it. Despite all the cons of the D800 and its quality control issues, it is an amazing camera.

So the stunning surprise with d600 for me was its ergonomics  -- from your knapsack it simply lands into your hands so well, somehow you don't feel the need for any tripod, and the controls are all in the right place, and the viewfinder ... well, brings back to the mystique of looking through a Nikon viewfinder from the film days.I started with the auto modes initially and the exposure accuracy often makes you a smile.  Nevertheless I go mostly manual at this point -- the sheer fun of photography is back, that's how I characterize the d600 now.

I'm moving from Pentax, so none of my old gear is compatible.I got my right camera. The D600 has enough controls to keep me satisfied. I like lots of dedicated buttons for different functions. This has three dials also. I'm particularly happy with the two custom setting on the dial below the normal rear control dial. I have one set for my low light shooting and one for landscape. What's more important to me is an intangible. The camera feels right, solid but reasonably light, well balanced and obviously designed by a photographer. The other options in the price range, the old 5D Mark II, never quite felt right, though I've rented one on a couple of occasions. The specs on the not-yet-released Canon 6D don't match my needs quite as well as this. I'm sure that's a good camera and will sell by the boat load, just not to me.Besides the controls in the right places and specs matching my needs, the camera excels at its most important function.

I have a D7000 which is an excellent camera but I've wanted to move to full frame; until recently full frame cameras were out of my price range. I photograph landscapes most of the time and the increased dynamic range and resolution of this camera appealed to me.I've only had the camera for two days, but already I can say that the low light capability, dynamic range and image quality are impressive. The body and menu system are very similar to the D7000 and so I was able to just pick it up and go.I was at about 250 shots and I checked for dust because of all the reviewers who have had the problem. Sure enough, I had five distinct spots in the upper left corner of my test shot. I used a Giotto blower, but it didn't remove all of them. Two of them are still there. I won't use anything other than the blower because I want to preserve the warranty. Since I do shoot landscapes, I am concerned about the spots. Reviewers have mentioned that if you shoot at wide apertures and are not a landscape shooter the spots won't be noticeable. I am a landscape shooter and I shoot at smaller apertures and I usually have bright sky in the upper part of the image.Unlike others who have not changed the lens and still found dust, I have changed lenses in order to try them on the camera. But I changed them only in the house, very quickly and carefully, so I doubt that these spots were introduced from outside the camera.Many reviewers recommend returning the D600 for another copy immediately or just returning it altogether, but it seems to me that there is a good chance another copy will have the same problem. Whether I return it will depend on how the problem proceeds -- or hopefully doesn't proceed over the next few hundred shots.

I typically wait at least six months for the kinks and issues to be worked out.  When Nikon made the announcement for this full frame D600 and they were delivered to retailers in a short amount of time...I had a gut feeling.  I was reading the specs, reviews and comments and knew I had to get this camera.I've had this camera for over a month and a half now and taken over 3600 pictures.  I've tested this camera in low light and in bright sunshine.  I'm quite impressed with this camera.Improvements over my D7k: - huge viewfinder - larger and deeper grip - larger LCD with auto brightness light - lock button on top of the main dial - full frame with more megapixels.Noticeable differences:  more menu items/selections, review zoom-in and zoom-out buttons reversed, and a bit heavier and slightly bigger camera.Overall conclusion:  This is a great camera that can use my FX lens as well as my DX lensSharp pictures with vibrant colors and beautiful IQ.  Quick focus.My camera settings: - Picture control - Standard - Exposure compensation - 0.0 - JPG - Large and Fine - JPEG compression - Optimal Quality - White Balance - Auto - Auto Normal - M1I hardly touch the exposure compensation button.  My camera seems to nail it about 95% of the time.  The other 5% of the time, I'm pushing the camera in difficult situations.I ended up purchasing the 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5G lens as I don't have an FX wide-zoom lens in my stash.  I do plan on purchasing the 24-70mm f/2.8G in the near future.  I have used my 85mm f/1.8G lens with beautiful results.  This camera and lens is a great combination for portraits and for general photography.I have used my 18-200mm DX lens with this camera without any issues.  Once the DX lens is mounted on the camera, the viewfinder shows a black outline.  The only minor issue with using the DX lens is the limitation of 10 megapixels.  After using an FX lens on an FX camera, it's really hard to go back to a DX lens and lower megapixels.I do have some minor dust spots and two oil spots.  They are located mostly on the left side.

Amazing colors, great low light performance, great for capturing action, and the videos are super-sharp with good sound quality even using the internal mike - just loved the camera performance!There are a few minor issues but you can always work around those:- The file sizes are huge, but you can take most photos as either medium or small size JPEGs which is fine for almost all purposes except for special occasions like weddings, when you want the RAW files.- If you use the internal mike for videos, then it will pick up the sound of the lens focusing or zooming, unless the background noise is loud enough to overpower the lens noise.- It definitely is heavier than some of the other cameras out there, especially with some of the heavier pro lenses mounted on it - but this kind of helps the overall balance of the camera and the quality of the photos more than make up for the weight! :) Overall impression - absolutely love the camera and would definitely recommend it!!May 2013 update:Seeing the dreaded dust spots on the camera sensor! I know - everyone has talked about it and some people say it is on every unit built and some say it is a minor issue. The problem is that for this price, I should not be seeing this issue even with rough usage. But I even change my camera lens in relatively clean environments - have never changed it on this one outdoors - which I did on the D80 and never saw any issues after so many years of use. The only saving grace is that Nikon service was pretty good about taking the camera back for a clean-up.I will update this review again once i receive the camera back and have used it for a few days.Final word - LOVE the camera - ABSOLUTELY HATE the dust spots!July 2013 update:Received the camera back from Nikon service center with the shutter mechanism replaced. I have been using the camera for the last 4-5 weeks and have changed the lens multiple times and haven't seen any dust-spot issues yet. But a lot of people have said this doesn't reoccur till about 2-3K shutter actuations so I will keep a close eye on this.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I guess I'm lucky", "Author": "Paul E.

MY SN is 300xxxx.Another note which may help some.  I am using SanDisk 32GB 45MB/s SD cards.  I used an older, slower card in a pinch and it was way too slow, especially when shutter was on continuous.  I recommend 45MB/s or faster SD cards.  I am shooting in RAW on 1st card and large JPEG on 2nd.Original post:  Once upon a time I was a part time, medium format, film, photographer.  Having put more effort into my full time career, pro photography went by the wayside.  I still kept in the loop with Nikon FE2's for slide presentations, etc.  Then the digital age came to town.  Eventually, I purchased a D50 to take my daughter's grad photos.  They really turned out well, but the D50 seemed somewhat limited, especially when working with my older prime lenses.  I looked at the D7000 and was about to turn the crank when the D600 was announced.  So, I bought one and am having a great time resurrecting my interest in photography.  I am also able to copy my old 35mm slides with the PB-6 and PS-6.  Being an FX, lenses such as 55 and 105 primes work well with the PB-6.  There just was not a suitable DX lens to do the same with the D50 or D7000.My old primes work great in M and A mode.  Metering works, which is lacking on the D50 for AIS lenses.  The ISO range up to 6400 seems to yield very good results also.RAW file size really taxes PC disk space for storage, but it is manageable.  I can't imagine this issue with the D800.The only negatives so far include dust on the sensor and battery life.  Never had either problem on the D50.  No oil on mine, but had to clean noticeable dust off once so far.  The battery life is real short compared to the D50.

I know the paper specs favor the D600 but the 6D ain't bad at all and if you do some checking you will find a few years ago Canon has an oil on the sensor issue with a couple of new cameras and they reacted totally differently than Nikon has. So maybe for some its OK to be sending a new camera back to be cleaned, or maybe some will risk the so cleaned 3000 shot fix but not me, I expect a company to stand by what they sell in better manor than Nikon has with this camera.

I just got the D600 last Monday and put it through a stress test shooting a wedding this past Saturday. Here're my initial impressions, which I'll start off with first.CONS:1) The hand grip is smaller than the D300. Yes, the camera as a whole is smaller than the D300 (obviously, people will be comparing it as a full frame D7000), but the grip is less comfortable on the D600 than the D300 because my fingers are a bit longer. After spending 10+ hours shooting a wedding, I didn't really notice any discomfort, but the D300 definitely sits in my hand better.2) The autofocus. Yes, low-light autofocus is terrible- I feel like it's much worse than the D300 (keep in mind, that's in low light- bright light is perfectly fine). I loathe using flash, and the D600 couldn't lock focus in low light- I ended up having to auto-focus using the center point so I could trigger the AF-illuminator light, and even then sometimes it struggled (using my 50mm and 20mm prime lenses). When paired with a SB-600, it autofocused fine in low light.3) AF-Area Points- Yes, the AF coverage is smaller than the D300. If you want to shoot by rule of thirds, good luck- the corners just seem to be outside of the AF area. Fortunately, you've got 24 MP to work with, so you can crop it til it works.4) Takes SD cards. Not really THAT bad, but I've got a bunch of compact flash cards that I was hoping to use. Fortunately, you can snag a sandisk 32gb class 10 for about $32 these days. That'll last you over a thousand shots on JPG FINE5) Mode dial lock- it takes a little TOO hard of a press to unlock the mode dial to switch it from M to the U1 and U2 buttons. I ended up not using it THAT frequently, but I'm sure I'll use it more as I get more time with my camera.6) Switching ISO/WB/Quality- If you're used to the highly useful top layout of the D300 for quick changes, I'm sure it'll get easier to switch these settings on the side panel (like my old D70).And really, the autofocus and hand grip were the two biggest cons for me. BUT, now that that's out of the way, let's get onto the good stuff:PROS:1) Full frame. Hands down. I've only used a D70 and D300, so having a full frame sensor is AMAZING. Dynamic range, picture quality straight out of the JPGs looks drastically better than APS-C sensors. While AF was hit or miss in low light, when it DID get the shot, shots at ISO6400 in near darkness were comparable to (if not better than) ISO1600 on my D300. It's amazing turning night into day indoors with low noise. For a non-flash junkie, this is a godsend.2) No crop factor- Another benefit of fullframe is not having the lens crop factor. My 20mm f/2.8 is now as wide as my DX 10.5mm fisheye! If you're into real estate photography, this is perfect for \"getting it all in\" for indoors shots, whereas the D300 rendered my 20mm f/2.8 as more like a 30mm lens. Yes, your nice 50mm lens is no longer as great for portraiture with the loss of the crop factor, but it's still usable regardless.3) Takes DX-lenses. Yes, it will crop to 10mp and you'll get the same crop factor as on APS-C lenses, but at least your DX lenses still work on this full frame camera.If you've been around since the D70, jumped to the D300, and are now looking at the D600, I would say just go for it- the full frame advantage is amazing. Sure people say for an extra $1000, you could have a D800, but for that amount, you could buy a pretty nice 85mm f/1.8 portrait lens to go with your new D600 too.Just the image quality at high ISOs and wider angle alone are worth it for me. However, as a portrait/event/wedding photographer, low-light applications are important to me. If you're more a sports/telephoto type person, perhaps the 1.5x crop factor for aps-c cameras may be more to your liking. And if you just want to take random shots here and there, I think the D600 may be overkill while the D7000 may be just fine for you.Compared to the Canon 6D? Apparently its center AF point focuses down to -3eV, so it may be great in low light capabilities. I couldn't care less for the GPS and wifi functionality of the 6D. I'm sure image quality on it is great though. Compared to the similarly priced 5dMK2? That's a tough call. If you're already invested in Canon lenses, maybe stick with Canon (I haven't had a chance to check the D600's video, but apparently Canon's is better).It really all depends on what your needs are as a photographer- don't blindly follow the Nikon-is-best-no-Canon-is-best arguments and get the camera for the shooting conditions YOU need. As for me? No regrets on the D600- after shooting a wedding all day, I didn't even reach for my old D300 once. 4 stars for the above listed cons, but I'm definitely keeping my D600 for the long run.UPDATED: 12/10/12 I've been shooting with this camera for over two months now and I'd just like to update a few things after using it for a while.1) AF- The wedding I had originally shot, I had issues with autofocus in extremely low light. I've shot a few weddings since then and I've just autofocused using just the center AF point and haven't had much a problem (mostly because I haven't had THAT low a light situation since then either).2) The color profile is a little bit off- it tends to a purplish hue or something, which means I should go in and fix it in-camera, but it's easily fixed in Lightroom as well3) Dust on sensor- Don't believe all the hype. Yes, there was some dust on the sensor when I first got it (and I only noticed when I shot at like, f/8+) but I've cleaned it that one time and haven't noticed any issues with it since then. It's really not a big deal, folks.4) I'm using lightroom 2 still and haven't gotten myself to upgrade to 4. As such, it can't read D600 raw files. Even so, my clients still love the output after jpeg post processing and I haven't missed raw too much and processing jpegs is just as fast and the results are still plenty sharp.5) ISO 6400 is still pretty amazing- pretty much like ISO 1600 for the D300.6) DX crop factor- whereas I could take decent shots of the moon on my 18-200mm DX lens on my D300, the 10mp dx mode on D600 when using the 18-200mm lens is not that great. You may just want to invest in some fx telezooms and get some teleconverters.Will update more later as I've been shooting a ton of weddings and Christmas card photos lately.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big Nikon fan disappointed this time....", "Author": "NikonGuy", "ReviewID": "R7A4L5H00O2C1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been a Nikon fan for all my life and probably will continue to be so.

It was definitely worth the upgrade.I'd really recommend getting some great lens too, like the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8.The dynamic range is incredible. I'd go to Lightroom 4 and turn to my brother and say, \"hey, how does this look\", and he'd go, \"looks too fake...like an HDR photo\", but then I'd tell him that I didn't even adjust much except lowering the highlights a bit.This doesn't ever happen with either my D90 or his Canon 7D!Low-noise high ISO performance is really good as well. Shot a couple of local soccer games under some weak floodlights. I went up to ISO 6400 and came back with really usable photos. Obviously it's got some noise but unless you zoom in closely, you wouldn't notice a big difference between these or photos taken in poorly-lit conditions at ISO 1600. I'm impressed.The body feels sturdy and weather-sealed. My first outing was for a pre-wedding shoot and it happened to be raining in 45F weather. This camera had no trouble battling the elements all day. Glad I wasn't using my D90 then, though it would've held up for a bit. I feel in total control and confident that I'll get great shots using this camera.Overall, I'm really happy with the D600.

Complaints are mostly about things which you know before you buy if you read any review.

If not though you have to remove your support hand to change it.The only annoyance a brand new camera with few and very careful lens swaps is yes! Dust! But let me comment.1. Please don't call it oil spots if its not because every picture I have seen online looked like mine did. It is not oil it is dust. Less than one minute and rocket blower in hand took care of all but a few faint stubborn spots.Giottos AA1900 Rocket Air Blaster Large - Black Using vibible dust plus and swab cleared all spots I could find.2.

Aside from not being able to take 9 exposure brackets (and that's really not that big of a deal), there's nothing I can find wrong with this thing. I'm an amateur who primarily shoots landscapes and architecture, the latter mostly at night and I was in the market to upgrade from my D5100 for the specific purpose of being able to shoot at higher ISO settings without ruining the picture with noise. I'm able to get perfectly usable stuff from the D600 at ISO 1600 and have been able to produce images that work as high as ISO 3200. This is a stark contrast from the D5100 where I never shot above ISO 1000 due to noise (the D5100 also has a relatively strong anti-aliasing filter which means almost everything required sharpening, thus exacerbating the noise problem).I'm finding that with my existing glass I almost never have to sharpen images in post processing. Of note is that the D600, being full frame, is significantly less pixel dense than pretty much every APS-C sensor equipped camera on the market. This, in part, explains the high ISO performance, but also means that lower resolution lenses could potentially result in sharper images with the larger sensor. I briefly considered going with the D800, however the pixel density there is extremely close to the D5100 and D7000 and I was unimpressed with high ISO raw samples that I've seen from it. The D600 hits the proverbial nail on the head when it comes to what I expected from the high ISO performance based on some pixel density math.Anyway, The build quality is exactly where I expected it and I've run into no surprises while out shooting. It took about 5 minutes after getting the battery in it to get all my settings where I wanted them and from there the operation is extremely similar to using pretty much every other reasonably recent Nikon SLR. I took the D5100 out of the bag and put the D600 in and there has been virtually no changes to my shooting workflow other than me wandering into darker spots and having to adjust to the wider field of view inherent with the larger sensor. My post processing workflow is requiring significantly less work as I'm not spending time fixing the inherent shortcomings of the D5100.Bottom line: It's fantastic.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "J.

Please keep in mind that my rating of this camera is strictly from the perspective of an advanced enthusiast and not a professional photographer.  I won't go into all of the technical aspects of the D600 since that has been well covered in other reviews. With that being said, I will give you my real world short answer as to why you will love the D600.  A quick backgrounder, I have been shooting with my beloved D90 for about 3 years and felt that it was time to upgrade to newer technology.  Before the D600 rumors started I was thinking about upgrading to the D7000.  However, I decided to wait since I have always wanted to own a full frame camera.  For D7000 owners out there this camera may feel similar but for me it is a night and day difference from my D90.  The D600 is noticeably larger than the D90 and fits so nicely in my hands and feels very solid.  The menu and button layout are consistent to the D90 so I had no problems figuring it out.  Is it worth $1000 more than the D7000?  YES!!! The D600 packs a juicy Full Frame Sensor, repeat a Full Frame Sensor (same as the one in the flagship D4 and D800).  And the viewfinder is huge; with 100% coverage.  I have my D600 paired with a Nikkor AF-S 50mm F1.8 G lens and the results are as expected; AWESOME.  I rarely shoot video so I won't comment on that aspect of the camera. Overall the D600 is a great full frame camera wrapped up in the perfect size body with a terrific price tag.10/24/12 Update:It's been a few weeks now and about three hundred images later and I must say that this was the best choice for me.  With my previous body (D90) I couldn't really crank up the ISO settings past 1000 without introducing a ton of noise and loss of resolution.  However, with the D600 I do not hesitate to capture images all the way up to ISO 6400!  This has allowed me to achieve sharp images, handheld, in the crummiest lighting situations without using an external flash.  I also finally shot some video and it's light years beyond the D90!", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "D600 review upgrade from DX", "Author": "Alexander Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R3DYYJ1PAXX2PJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought my D600 a few weeks ago, (unfortunately not from Amazon as I live where they will charge sales tax), and would like to share my experience.  I am an avid enthusiast for photography and very knowledgeable, just don't do it for the money, so I am not considered pro.  I had a Nikon D80...yes, unfortunately, which I bought before knowing anything about photography.  Over the last year, in anticipation to going full frame, I upgraded all of my lenses to include 24-70, 80-200, 85mm 1.4, 50mm 1.4.  Although the pictures looked nice on my DX body, just not enough to justify the hundreds or thousands spent on these lenses.  I was so frustrated with my DX body that I could not shoot at night, even when owning two speedlights.  The ISO on my camera was horrible on anything past 400.  As soon as I used the D600 I was blown away by the picture quality.  The dynamic range was so much better, crystal clear image and the ISO was incredible.  I guess I bought a new use of my camera and lenses, night time shooting! Yes there are many features inside the D600, and probably too many for me to look into as I will never use it.  So the main things I looked for were ISO, metering, picture quality, focus speed and accuracy.  These were superb compared to what I had before and if you are considering upgrading from a DX body you will not be dissapointed in dropping 2k for this.  Some things which others have mentioned I will touch on: - zoom in/out button, yes it is reversed and even knowing that I still click on the wrong one.  But who cares I will learn it soon eventually. - AF - yes it does have 39 points and all in the center, but no big deal for me coming from 11 points and no AF recognition just point focuses.  I have been used to focusing and recomposing.  - Video - beautiful video but yes focusing the camera you can hear the lens movements (zoom, focus) pretty loudly on the mic no matter if you use a AF-S lens or fixed lens just on the focus.  - SPOTS ON CENSOR - yes, unfortunately, it did happen to me.  Not sure when, but I first checked it at 500 plus clicks and found multiple spots.  You will not notice it, unless you look for it (F11 up, take a shot of the sky).  But once you do, it will bother you for sure.  I tried my giottos rocket blower, and still remained so must be something other than dust.  Unfortunately, I decided this is a flaw that I can't overlook with a 2k camera, so I decided to return it and thank goodness I was able to.  I was told by customer service that this was an issue with earlier batches but the new batches have been fixed by Nikon.  So I will update this review once I receive the new camera.

There were the rare times that I would select U2 mode and allow the camera to auto adjust ISO just to keep shutter speed high and avoid the risk of not getting the shot.  On the D7000, ISO 1600 was about the limit.  I could go higher but it required additional work to make the image presentable.  The D600 has changed my mind.  ISO 6400 is very usable.  If I really wanted to be careful I might limit auto ISO to 4000.  Shooting in the evening with a Nikon 105mm f2.8 macro lens, the images ranged from ISO 800 to 6400, but I had to look at the exif details to determine the ISO.  The images were stunning.

It was a no-brainer to get this camera - the images are absolutely stunning, and the ton of features are mind-boggling. The one thing I have to nitpick about is the design of the external battery grip - whereas I was able to store both batteries in the grip and remove them easily to charge them, the D-600 design requires one battery in the camera and the other in the grip. Minor issue though.As for the big issue with the camera, I have not experienced the oil spot problem yet - I've shot approximately 300 images and hope I don't get that problem, but just in case, I purchased the Eclipse sensor cleaning solution and cleaning swabs from PSI, so if it I do get the oil spots, I can clean them quickly.

As I obliviously shot away for the last several weeks, using my precious 105mm f2 DC Nikkor AF, and eight other lenses including perspective control on portraits, landscapes, new products, through microscopes (I am a lab owner) and interiors, and using the Nikon RAW converter, I have become very pleased with the results, almost to the point of neglecting my several 4x5 cameras!  After only a few weeks I have managed to shoot difficult subjects (high contrast, or difficult access) that I would not have attempted with film.  This set me to converting a Sonnar 180mm f2.8 to Nikon mount by way of a Pentax 67 mount converter, and get several other lenses such as my Hartblei Supperrotator in the lineup to see if the RAW converter and image processing SW could clean up some CA, which it did perfectly. My only disappointment so far has been with the Nikkor 24mm f2.8 on this body, but that's the lens.I also got the battery grip and together this is great, as I prefer portrait orientation anyway.  The compact body and the grip are perfect for my hands.So now I nervously await \"oil spots\" and specks. Every day now I check to see if they have appeared, but I've only shot 1000 or so frames and none in burst mode, and not a speck, not even the smallest mote can be seen on the sensor with my good magnifiers.Anyway I love it.

Upon searching on the Internet, I discovered that on 'some' of these cameras, this was known to be a problem caused by dirt and oil being ejected from the sensor.Contacting Amazon, I was told that, \"because it was no longer a 'new' camera\", that they \"would have to charge up to an 80% 're-stocking fee\"! On a $2,000 camera I would get back $400??? Not possible!So, I turned to Nikon. What I now think is due to quite specific consumer protection laws, all they (or any corporation) can offer is to repair the camera and re-make it the way it should have been when I bought it.At this point I was gravely concerned that they wouldn't actually fix anything but merely delay the inevitable. I was wrong!The camera went back to Nikon and after two weeks was back and fully repaired!And when I say full repaired, I mean that they fixed things that I hadn't even asked them to fix. They completely replaced both the shutter AND the sensor as well as reprogrammed/replaced the ASIC processor to radically improve the white balance which I had noticed but hadn't mentioned was not nearly as good as the colors I was getting when shot with my older D7000 body. They also, because I'd requested it in my letter, test fired and checked the sensor for dirt using their special gear a half a dozen times to make sure the problem was truly solved!Better still, while the camera was out for repair, Nikon notified me of their 'new' policy, offering free shipping and repair of the shutter and sensor on the D600! So, they have responded to this annoying problem in an affirmative way, finally!I couldn't be happier with the results! The images I've shot in the first few hours since the camera was returned are truly remarkable.I've shot with the D7000 for the past couple of years and the D600 works and feels very similar (although better!) but the larger sensor with it's larger sensor sites produce much lower noise, higher ISO images than I'd expected! So much so that I've already decided to sell my D7000,This was a rocky start but I am thrilled with the final result so, I've upgraded my rating to 4 stars.BTW I realize that many reviewers have suggested skipping the D600 and buying the D610, instead. For me, the extra $400 was too much! I am more than satisfied with Nikon's service and repair. Having had time to cool down and reflect on the entire process, I still would go through it, again!It's a great camera, worth the short pain and I expect that I will use it for many years to come.Also, any time within the first year of Nikon's warrantee, an extended Nikon warrantee can be added that will take care of any future problems with this amazing camera.

However, if a number of multiple granular black spots are still noticeable in images captured with a D600 upon which the above service has been performed several times, Nikon will replace it with a new D600 or an equivalent model.Nikon will continue to work to improve the quality of its products and services even further.We hope that you will continue to choose Nikon products for your photographic needs.\"", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Serious flaw with the D600", "Author": "John T.

Although many comparisons are being drawn between the two, the image quality is a night and day difference.  The cameras really only look alike on the outside.  When I compare images I took with both cameras, the D600 is consistently more contrasty, subjects are more isolated from their backgrounds, and the colors are just beautifully rich.  At the time I considered buying the D800, but I didn't want a 36mp camera.  The file sizes are just unnecessarily huge.  The D700 was closer to what I wanted, but there was no video.  The D600 is exactly what I hoped for.  Full frame, HD video, and smaller file sizes.  My only complaint is the autofocus points are grouped a little too tightly in the center.  They are basically the same as the D7000, except the sensor is bigger, so there's a large area around the perimeter that has no focus points.

I just wet cleaned it to make sure, and I fired-off 500 shots, and I see no oil spots!I also bought a Neewer grip from eBay for $48.62 shipped, and I just received it a few days ago. In the past, I've tried a Neewer grip for my D300, and it felt really good but the battery compartment latch broke easily (the latch on the D600 model doesn't look any better), and the AA tray made a bad connection with the grip (the D600 model doesn't look like it will have this problem), and I tried 2 of them before buying a Zeikos D300 grip. The Zeikos didn't feel as good (grip wasn't as deep, and there was less rubber near the thumb area) but the battery compartment latch and connections were far more reliable.----------------------------------------------------------Instead of posting a polished review, I decided to add bits and pieces so that others can benefit from this sooner before I compile everything into a traditional review.I've been shooting a D300 ever since it came out (D1x, D200, Fuji S5 before), and I must say that my first impressions are VERY favorable.

(27 vs 20 frames RAW 12-bit compressed) Clears in about 10 seconds with the Sandisk card shown at the bottom!-Video mode (obviously)When I first took it out of the box today, I noticed that the grip is smaller, and the body feels plasticky but that does not affect anything. It's just something to get used to. This is a weather-sealed body designed to resist the elements.The AF system is blazing FAST! It feels MUCH faster than the one on my D300, which really surprised me.I also love that there is an AUTO setting for the minimum shutter speed setting for the AUTO ISO setting (this may be nothing new but it's new to me). For example, when I have my lens set at 24mm, it chooses a minimum shutter speed of 1/25, and when I'm zoomed to 120mm, it chooses 1/125 as the minimum shutter speed. I love it!I will report back when I have more to share. Make sure you use UHS-1 cards for the quickest buffer emptying times. I'm using it with a Sandisk 64GB card, and the buffer clears in about 10 seconds. VERY VERY FAST!

I also sold my Fuji X100, but that was more because of the Fuji's ever-hunting, unreliable close focus.At $2100, the D600 camera is by no means cheap in price, but considering how much my folks paid for their manual-focus Nikon 35mm camera in the 1980's, when you adjust for inflation the D600 isn't that pricey.

With this newer Nikon D600, I now need my left hand to adjust the Auto-Focus settings, ISO and White Balance. One more setting to change with my left hand is not a big deal breaker for me. With the Canon 6D, almost all settings can be changed with your right hand alone.My version of this camera also doesn't have the lubrication problem nor did it come with dust issues. In time dust will get to the sensor but that goes with all DSLR's. I'm not sure why some versions of this has dust/lubrication issues but when I asked the sales person at the camera store, he mentioned that they have sold many D600's since it was released and not one has been returned for any of those issues.

As someone that loves available light photography, the capabilities of the D600 and it's amazing Full Frame sensor are astounding.  I had been shooting with a Sony NEX-5 mainly prior to picking this camera up, mostly with Nikon glass adapted to the NEX and focusing manually. With the NEX-5 I could get away with ISO 3200 and chock up most of the grain as artistic, and do some black and white for the shots that were particularly grain heavy. That is not the case with the D600. I shoot it in my U1 mode, which is essentially Aperture priority with Auto-ISO enabled up to ISO 6400. At ISO 6400 the colors, grain, and overall picture quality are more acceptable than ISO 1600 on my Sony. Really no comparison. I've been astounded with the low light capabilities of the camera.  Some people have complained about the AF on the D600 and in particular low light. I have not had an issue here. I mainly shoot in AF-C, 9 or 21 points and use the AE/AL button as AF-On and the Shutter release on release priority. This has proven exceptionally reliable for me.  The other big issue people seem to have is the dust or potentially oil. Most of my shooting is at an Aperture between f/1.8 and f/5.6. I can not see any dust visible in any of those shots. That being said, when I checked a shot of a white wall at f/16 with my tripod I could see some dust. I grabbed my rocket blower, blasted the sensor a few times, and the vast majority is gone. I will keep an eye on this 'issue' but it has not impeded my enjoyment of this camera in any way what so ever.  All in all, I can't recommend this camera enough for someone looking to make the jump to a full frame sensor camera if your looking for the advantages it can bring and live with any disadvantages. If your looking at this camera, you probably already know what your getting into and are aware of what it has to offer and it's short comings vs a D800 or D700.

In the first instance, a person should make no mistake: the quality of the images from the D600 are professional, i.e. as good as the images from my D4; though the camera's focusing performance under relatively low-light (e.g. in an ordinarily lighted high school gym) was almost awful and consistently unpredictable. And this is linked with its one sad shortcoming that can't be emphasized enough: the D600 is a $2000 camera, not a 5 or 6 thousand dollar camera, and has the focusing system of about a $1500 camera -- that is, about as good as the focusing on my old Canon 5d Mark II. If a person is coming from a D7000 or D300 background it won't matter one iota. Those people know the normal 'roll-the-dice' prospect of non-professional cameras, probably without really being keenly aware of this fact. The beautiful images they DO capture with the D600 will color their feelings about the camera and (rightfully so) encourage them to sing praises of the D600 and its great sensor. Incidentally, the oil/dust/funky sensor topic was of no concern whatever with this camera. After first checking a skylight image at f22 -- and finding nothing -- I ran the software for actuations and noted the count on this lens rental at 4,410 clicks. As a small, almost comical aside I can't help but mention how the quality of the D600 battery/battery life has now pissed me off no-end about the inferior, crappy, substandard battery resting in my D4! The D600 battery could typically go three working days without requiring a charge. The D4 battery, the EN-EL18... well,... you don't want to know how poorly the D4 battery gets along during a similar stretch of time. (Gosh dogg it!!) In a continued quest for the best back-up camera the D700 arrives at my place tomorrow from LensGiant rentals. I'll try and briefly update this post after spending time with that babe of a camera.

Here are the pros and cons I've found for the camera first then the lens.D600Pros- this is my first full frame camera and coming from a DX sensor i see the pics contain a lot more detail and under exposed images can be brightened up a lot and still contain a ton of detail.No auto focus issues with my camera. Tested the lens and camera and they both focused well.It's a little bigger than the D7000 but it only took me a day of shooting to control everything with my eye on the viewfinder like I do with my D7000Battery life is still good. A little worst than the D7000 but only slightly noticeable.Cons- I hate the autofocus points. Their very close together and I like to shoot more in the corners. You must use the recomposing technique with this camera.  All those auto focus points are pretty much useless. They could have gotten the same job done with 5 or 9 points.I wish it had 3 user programmable settings instead of two. I really only use M, U1 and U2. A and S come in handy but that Scene setting should be a U3. Also, I don't like how you have to push the middle button down before you can turn the knob to change the settings. My D7000 didn't have that button and I never had a problem with my camera modes changing when I didn't want them to.That's all the flaws I can think of with the body so on to the lens.28-300mm LensPros- I use my sharper fixed lenses under predictable conditions, but there is no better lens for the unpredictable. I wanted this for my general use walking lens. Nothing more, so even though the focal length overlaps all my lenses. I doesnt replace any of them. I take this lens with me in the woods where you never know what you're going to see but when you see it the right lens better be on your camera.  This lens is going to let you get a great shot under most conditions. I can be doing a landscape shot, then when that hawk lands on a branch near me I can zoom in and get the shot before it flys off.  I've missed a lot of great shots because I was trying to change lenses but now it rarely happens.Cons- well it's decently sharp and vivid but it's not gonna win awards for any of that stuff. Nikon makes a lot of money off lenses so even if they could they would never make a lens that was great at everything.  Again, I use my fixed lenses when I'm doing the predictable stuff like portraits or indoor work or low light work because their better lenses for that job.

I've taken thousands of photos with the D300 and have been overall pleased with that body. However, indoor photos with no flash were always a challenge, and bumping the ISO much past 600 or 800 yielded rather noisy images. This was the primary driving force behind me moving to the D600. After two weeks with the D600 I can say that I'm very happy with the move. Images are clean at much higher ISOs and the camera performance as far as focus, color accuracy, etc has been fantastic, even with 39 versus 51 focus points.Not much more can be said to praise the D600 than has already been posted in previous reviews.I will say this in comparison to the D300. I notice the difference in frames per second because I used the MB-D10 grip at all times with my D300, and it shot at 7fps. There isn't a huge difference, but for sports it could mean a shot or two lost that might have been captured with the D300.I also miss some of the dedicated buttons and switches on the D300, but all the functions controlled with them can be changed with one extra step on the D600, so I can live with it.Image quality is quite a step up from the D300, and I'm extremely happy with my purchase so far. I'll update this review when I've put more miles on it.Update: Oh no, I have dust on my sensor too. BUT, I'm not freaking out about it. It's not noticeable at apertures that I typically shoot, and I can clean the sensor myself until Nikon recalls or puts out a statement on a cause and fix. A new firmware update is supposed to fix the 'no aperture change in video mode' and 'border around HDMI out' issues.Once the 'dust' issue is resolved what will there be to complain about?I continue to be amazed at the image quality I'm getting compared to my beloved D300. I can push the shadow areas in post processing far more than I could with the D300 due to the increase in dynamic range. I'm getting used to the button placement. I'm hoping Nikon's firmware update adds a zoom function to the dpad button.I've added the grip as I was used to keeping the MB-D10 on my D300.

Saw a lot of comments about the oil specs issue but since my D70 i realized how much i missed the large viewfinder in my F80 film SLR. D800 costs too much for me so D600 was the next best full-frame Nikon camera. I had considered the DX-sized D7100 but i hated the small size of the image in the D70's viewfinder so decided to spend a grand more and buy the D600 and stick with it for the next 10 years again. The camera can take movie at 1080p at 30fps (wish it could match gopro specs) with audio so this baby should last until 4k, 3D or even 360 degrees SLR cameras become main-stream.The full-frame 100% coverage for the D600 viewfinder is excellent. Once again, i can tell if a horizon if flat through the viewfinder and there is no more conversion of mm to DX mm.So far, i have taken 400 shots with my camera without seeing any oil on the sensor. If it is any help to others, mine is made in Thailand and the serial number is 8049xxx. It looks like Nikon has fixed their manufacturing process for the D600. I will think that the serial number is a running number so numbers 8049xxx and above should no longer have the oil-specs issue.Bought this off a store because i could at least talk to a person and confirm that the D600 was from a recent shipment. When the D600 works without issue, i think it is a sweet camera for former Nikon film SLR enthusiast. Coming from film and D70, i know video is something the photos cannot capture and D600 takes good High res video i can enjoy.

Can spend that thousand on a grip, flash, and Hoya polarizing filter. Or whatever else.The pictures it takes are amazingly sharp, and it offering 2x SD card slots is an advantage over the more expensive SD+CF combination in the D800 as SD cards are significantly cheaper than the CF cards.The camera clearly has weight, but it does not balance too well with heavier lenses such as the 24mm 1.4G or 24-70mm 2.8G (weight was fairly nicely balances with my 85mm 1.4G, however). I like how the size was just about right, just not the weight.There's a Fn button on the front that's accessible with your right ring finger, or right pinky, but poorly placed as it is hard to reach. The dials offer great on-the-fly adjustment to ISO (I shoot mostly in Aperture), so if you outgrew your DX, it's a plus.Drawbacks aside from the dust issue is that the fastest shutter speed is only 1/4000 (compared to 1/8000 in D700, D800, etc.), good but not amazing ISO performance (very good comparable to the D3s up to 6400)--but that is to be expected with 24.3 MP.Wish the menu could be a bit easier to customize (hint* hint*, Nikon--go model it after Sony's, hint*)Overall, a keeper and you won't regret buying one if it doesn't have the dust issue.My D600 serial was 3014xxx. For those purchasing the D600, you will only start noticing the scraping of the black finishing on the bottom of the mirror mechanism after about 1000-15000 actuations. If you shoot with a small aperture (like 1.4 to 1.8) a lot, you won't notice the dust accumulation, but it's there. Way to solve it or overcome it is to wet clean (voids warranty, so don't do it unless you are completely sure of yourself) every 2 thousand shots or so until the problem goes away (after it scrapes all the black finishing off, nothing left to scrape), or to send it to Nikon to service.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "A real step up", "Author": "John H. Hyman \"SciFiJunkie\"", "ReviewID": "R1K13XSH1L9FAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having wanted to migrate to a FX sensor for about a year the release of the D-600 was very well timed for me. The D-800 is an outstanding camera but produces enormous files and requires a  33% greater investment. The D-600 feels solid and produces stunning images. All of the features stemming from the more advanced menu, larger LCD, ISO range, dual SD slots, etc are all improvements over my D-200's.The camera, with the vertical grip, is easily 30% heavier than the comparable D-200.Although rated at 5 fps I am finding the D-600 to fire faster than my D-200's did (and are rated the same). The shutter actuator is also more sensitive in continuous shooting mode- it's common to fire three or four when you wanted two or three, but that may just need time for me to learn the new body's feel.Having said that there are a few really annoying quirks:(1) To change the ISO or White Balance you have an external button on the bottom of the back of the camera, or by accessing the menu. Try using this button with a 400mm lens attached- can't be done. The button is really in an awkward location.(2) The button to activate Live View is too close to where your thumb naturally falls holding the camera. It is easily activated by accident. Plus to properly use Live View Nikon suggests using a eyepiece cover (included with the camera) to eliminate stray light that might affect exposure. But there is no convenient place to store this small item and you have to remove the current eyepiece cover... and out it in your pocket (the solid cover does have a clip for your strap, if you use the narrow Nikon straps but will likely fall off). Why not offer an internal eyepiece shutter (eg: film cameras in the 60's).(3) Autofocus operates very differently and I am still experimenting to find the best settings for my needs. Many of my initial test shots are locking on backgrounds and not the subject in moving action.(4) Adobe Lightroom cannot yet process D-600 files. And while using Nikon ViewNX does allow you to convert to other formats  it does not handle the post production workflow that LR does. Adobe is expected to have this addressed by the end of the year.None the less the still and video image quality is outstanding and I continue to be amazed at how sharp cropped images appear.One other large improvement is with the external battery/vertical grip (sold as an option). The vertical grip for the  D-200 was flimsy, the doors and battery clips easily broke. This unit is solid and has a completely different battery housing process.Thus far I am extremely pleased with the D-600 and as I become for comfortable with it in use feel confident my few gripes will vanish.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great full frame (FX) camera by Nikon", "Author": "Joan McBryde", "ReviewID": "R354SN3WCKWZZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a great size and weight but still offers high image quality.

The main reason for this switch is because of the full-frame sensor. I believe that photographer thinks so much more about the photographing process when using a full frame. When shooting APS-C, the crop allows you to shoot wide-open (large f-stop) and not worry too much about softness. Full-frame, on the other hand, is the full frame. You have to know your lenses' capabilities. Understand when things are sharp or soft. For people who like to shoot wide angles, well it's a just a perfect upgrade. Some of the things that Full-frame allows is greater depth-of-field, more detailed when enlarging, better ISO noise performance, and  the use of the lenses native length (i.e. 50mm is 50mm, 85mm is 85mm). But most people thinking of buying this camera know that.The Nikon D600, is well built, not a strong as a D800 but the size difference and weight difference is very large. The Viewfinder is huge, it's a full-frame viewfinder with 100% viewfinder coverage. 5.5 fps or something like that, enough for me and most likely enough for you. 24 megapixels for whoever needs that much (36 megapixels is too much for a lot of people including me). The D600's iso performance is amazing. Slow lens? Bad lighting? Night time? Moving subject?...Well it'll help alot, you won't be scared to buy a F4 lens or shoot at night without flash. Don't underestimate the depth of field, when you really learn how to use a full frame camera, you'll have a whole new perspective on photography. Even though, the comparable Canon 6d hasn't come out, the information about it disappointed me. Canon disappointed me and Nikon just caught them off guard (Sony is thinking more outside the box then Canon). It seems Canon heard about the D600 and started scrambling to put something comparable on the market (in December). I've switched from Canon to Nikon, for many people that is tough. For example I had only a couple of lenses that I bought used and sold them for about the same I bought them for. My Canon t2i broke a couple of months ago and I was waiting for 5d mark iii and d800 to come out (mark ii is great, but an old system and I wanted up to date, and d700 doesn't have video). Both 5d mark iii and d800 were out of my price range, I liked the canon 5d mark iii better out of the two. Then I waited for Photokina, and I am glad I waited.

Yamamoto", "ReviewID": "R32QXWUMVK8BXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update (09/27/2012): I played more with high ISO images from D600. Actually, RAW files are not bad at all. They are pretty much equal or very little more noises than 5D MK3. It is just the D600 JPEG engine does not perform as good as 5D MK3. I hope Adobe updates with their RAW support for D600 soon. I have nothing bad to say about the camera now. This is by far the best camera at the price point!(Original Summary)I have been a D7000 user who just got D600. This camera is right at home for me since most controls are similar and better. I am not 100% happy with the AF speed in low light, but hey I did not pay that much, so I should not complain. I love the image quality at lower ISO. However, I envy Canon 5D Mk3's low light performance. D600 at 6400 ISO is usable, but it can get pretty noisy in shadow area. Sony sensors have better DR for sure, but no matter what DxO says, Canon 5D MK3 got better high ISO performance. This issue too I should not complain since I did not pay 5D Mk3 price. As a result, this is still the best camera for me who owns several Nikon lenses. When I first heard that D600 had 12 Mega pixel less than D800, I was hoping D600 would get less noisy than D800. It turned out that they are both similar in low light performance. I guess I was expecting too much from an affordable FF camera.Pros:1. D7000 like controls with improvements2. Amazing image quality at lower ISO3. Affordable Price4. Smaller body5. Faster Continuous Shooting than D8006. Amazing Dynamic Range7. Build-in Flash, HDR, and Timelapse mode8. Supports most Nikon lenses9. Not many people talk about this, but I love the LCD cover on Nikon cameras for protection.10. Battery life is much better than Sony SLT or mirrorless cameras11. Much better Auto ISO setting than D700012. 39 AF points. Yes, the AF area is smaller, but I am OK with it.Cons:1. No aperture control in live view and in movie mode!!! Why?!!! I guess to implement a powered aperture mechanism in a live view costs.2. I thought Sony sensors had better low light performance than Canon sensors in general like in APS-C. D600 still performs much better than D7000 in low light, but I was hoping D600 does little better than what I see from ISO6400 images.3. The AF system suppose to be the same as D7000 or better, but I often get hiccups in low light where D600 sits for a second or so.4. 1/4000 shutter speed, which is slower than D7000. Well, the D600 sensor is bigger, so I guess that is max they can do for the price.5. This is not about the camera, but I was hoping Nikon bundled a better kit lens like Canon 24-105L lens. I guess Nikon 24-120 F4 is too much to bundle as a kit lens then.All in all, I am very satisfied. I know I cannot get everything from a low cost FF camera, but if I can ask for one thing from D600 was to have little better low light performance.

I've been waiting for about 3 years and I'm so happy I did that. This camera is everything I wanted, coming from a DX class DSLR.

That's a tall claim but with the introduction of Nikon D600 and Canon 6D, it won't take long before APS-C DSLR fall out of favor. It'll be prudent to remember that there was no APS-C format during film days. APS-C was created because manufacturing a 35mm digital sensor was prohibitively costly. It was a compromise to reach a certain price level. As D600/6D have shown, affordable full frame is a reality now. APS-C compromise is no longer required. Yes you'd lose extra reach that APS-C provides with existing zoom lenses, but you get extra dynamic range, ISO performance and lower noise with a full frame.Point and shoot cameras are a dying breed already. They are being replaced by smartphones. Similarly, APS-C DSLR will give way to APS-C and micro-four thirds mirrorless cameras as they reach (already have) the technical performance of a APSC-C DSLR. People who want it light and still have a high quality camera will gravitate towards these. And people who need maximum quality will reach out to full frames.Coming to D600, it's an awesome camera. Anyone who's coming from D7000 will feel right at home. People who make a living off photography may still go for D800, but for an amateur or a casual photographer who wants a full frame quality should be more than happy with D600. But people who've never handled a DSLR before should know that it's still a BIG camera with enough heft to it. If size and weight is a concern to you, Olympus OM-D E-M5 16MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3.0-Inch Tilting OLED Touchscreen [Body Only] Silver is an excellent light weight camera.Images straight out of the camera are clean and great. To maximize D600's excellend sensor, you'd be better served with high quality lenses. My pick would be Nikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR FX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens. The 24-70 is great for all day shooting and 50mm comes in handy at night.Additionally, buy OP/TECH USA 1501012 Pro Strap for cameras and binoculars- neoprene (Black) which will make the camera feel much lighter than it actually is.On the downside, the focus points are concentrated towards the center. It's a pity for such a high-end camera. Also, it's high time Nikon/Canon include in-body stabilization in their camera bodies. This will free the lenses from having a VR of it's own making them cheaper, lighter and hopefully optically more superior. Nikon 24-70 2.8, as great as it is, doesn't have a VR and could benefit from a camera with built-in VR. Olympus has implemented in-body stabilization in OM-D E-5 really well.I whole-heartedly recommend D600 for anyone looking for a full-frame, but after spending a small fortune on this camera, I advise not to skimp on good lenses.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "the best value full frame dslr", "Author": "nikonuser", "ReviewID": "RGB3RZLY5XTQ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my d600 for about 4 months now.

I am able to take great photos and not be burdened by D800's extra bulk and megapixels (think retouch.... the more you capture, the more you might have to clean up!).I bought this camera as I switched from the Canon 50D APC-C system.  I'm glad I did because I find the camera controls more natural to me (Canon is great too and you can see many pros use Canon but it just wasn't for me).The only initial draw back I saw was the lack of the pc-port for the flash sync cord but I quickly got over it since there's the Creative Lighting System CLS and also plenty of options for remote flash triggers ($30 to hundreds if you want to get Pocket Wizards).This is a great entry level FX camera.  Some reviews on the net may prefer this over D800 because it's lighter and less MP to deal with. Imaging 45MByte raw files instead of 30Mbytes.... it will add up quickly and also takes more computer power to process them all!  My macbook pro can barely keep up with fast edits of the 24 megapixel pictures, I can't imagine working withe more megapixels... it will probably frustrate me into buying faster and faster computer systems.I would skip the KIT lens, I bought it because Amazon had a sale and the price was the same as body-only.  I'll be selling the kit lens as soon as I can to recoup some of the cost I've invested into the other lens.Update: I decided to check for dust/oil again after more than 7500 actuations.  I checked once before around 1000 and didn't see problems but now I do see a lot spots on the left side of the screen and less on the right side of the screen.While this is very disappointing, and I will be complaining to Nikon about this, it's visible to me when I'm using F11 or slower.

I bought the kit with the 24-85 mm lens, and the image quality definitely lives up to the hype.  I'm replacing a D300 (which was another excellent Nikon dSLR for its time), and the improvement in image quality is amazing.  The ISO performance is outstanding, and the Auto White Balance is shockingly accurate.  My fianc\u00e9 has been shooting a Canon 5D and just got the 6D; even he's impressed by the images from my D600, and actually considered getting one if it hadn't been for all of the Canon glass he already owns.My only gripe about the camera is that the selector for switching between movie and photo live view appears to be non-functional on my unit.  Switching from photo live view to movie live view produces no noticeable change in the live view window (it doesn't look like the manual suggests it should in movie mode), and pressing the movie shutter button results in no response.  I don't shoot movies (aside from my pets using my iPhone) and didn't buy the camera for this feature (would have bought it without it, frankly), but I do expect all functions to work as advertised.  I searched online and didn't see any indication that this is a broader issue with the D600, so I'm willing to chalk it up to a one-off defect.Amazon immediately shipped out a replacement (next-day air, as per the original order), and issued an RMA for the return, with shipping at their expense - no questions asked (well, other than what was the nature of the problem).  Outstanding customer service, as usual.I'll update this review when I receive the replacement unit and verify that it's functioning properly.*****  UPDATE  1/2/13 *****I received my replacement camera today, and the movie mode works just fine.  I've upgraded my review to 5 stars on the basis that the camera takes spectacular images and has outstanding AWB and ISO performance, and I still have not found any evidence online that my movie mode issue is a recurring problem.As a note, I can't yet comment on whether this camera will exhibit the sensor dust/spotting issue.  My personal view on this topic is that it sounds like this is really only noticeable when stopped down (and I rarely shoot at f/22) and looking at sky or blank walls; although it may be an annoyance to have to clean the sensor a few times in the first few thousand shots, I'd rather have to deal with that than wait for an unknown period of time to buy (i.e., wait to take more of these great photos).

The biggest adjustment shooting on the D600 is: the FX sensor allows you to get more accurate and wider coverage in viewfinder(no more cropped images like my 300s, what you see is what you get now) and the 39 focus points is accurate and fast but seem to be crowded mainly in the center (my 51 focus points on my D300s covered more area).

But that goes without saying--it's a FX Nikon, of course it's amazing.  That being said, I personally bought this camera and returned it, and went for the Canon 6D.  A good part of this decision is due to the fact that I am more invested in the Canon system, but I do own both.  If there were no other significant drawbacks to the D600, I would have kept it, as it is a superior camera spec-wise; usability wise however, is a different story.  I'll start with the bad, in order of how much it bugs me (a lot to a little):1) The user interface is clunky.  It doesn't make sense, unlike the D7000/7100.  Buttons buttons positioned on the left side of the screen are neither related, nor do they follow any sort of discernible pattern.  It requires memory, which is fine if this is the only camera you shoot, ever.  But not even amateurs like myself shoot more than one camera.  I cannot be pressed to be farting around with a control scheme that doesn't make sense.  Other than the button layout, the ISO control is wonky, the AF control is wonky, and the two stacked mode dials is...well, I'm not a fan.2) NO APERTURE CONTROL IN LIVE VIEW?!?!?!?  Not much of a problem for stills, but I do shoot with LV on tripod for landscapes often, so this really bugs me.  Typically I have a lot of time when shooting landscapes, so it's not too big a deal, but cmon Nikon....  If you plan to use this camera for video, FORGET IT--pay $1000 for the D800...  Why Nikon hasn't moved their system towards a hybrid mechanical/electronic aperture control is beyond me--it's 2013!  Your mechanical AF control is what made you lose market share to Canon in the first place...learn from your mistakes!3) ISO Performance could be better.  This is very important to me, as I shoot a lot of indoors and try my best to avoid flash if I can (flash is very difficult to use correctly, and therefore takes me too long to compose shots; also it's very distracting and annoying to my subjects).  If you're coming from a crop sensor, yes, the ISO performance is amazing, but compared to other FX camera bodies (D700, 5D3, 6D, A99), it falls short.  For the 'armchair' photographers, yes, dxo says this body has 'the best' ISO performance (and I love DXO--very useful website), but sorry, that's just blatantly wrong--go look at ANY site online with comparison pics.  The D600 does have 24 MP, this I'm sure this is part of it (smaller pixel pitch), but on JPEG w/NR on (\"best\" ISO performance), I can't bring myself to shoot at ISO 6400--on my 6D, I can and do shoot at ISO 12,800 under the same conditions without batting an eyebrow.  Put the D600 on RAW, and it's all downhill from there.4) AF Performance could be better.  It's NOT BAD, don't get me wrong, but it's not good either.  I would have expected better with 39x9 AF system, but with all the points are crammed in the center, making it absolutely no different than the 6D, which has an 11x1 AF system.  The bonus with the 6D is that the center point is -3EV sensitive.  I would have expected to feel a discernible difference between the AF systems of the two cameras, but I cannot (though, it should be said, that AF nowdays is equally contingent on the lens, where Canon tends to be superior).  In a nutshell, it's good, but it really doesn't feel any better than 'the crummy 6D'.5) Grip is tiny.  I don't mind at all, as I have small-medium hands, but I can see this bugging people with larger hands.  The 6D is a smaller body overall, but has a bigger grip....what?6) Green screen problem.  Why has this not been fixed yet?  Since it doesn't actually affect the picture (at least as far as I can noticeably tell, green is quite forgiving, so it's arguable), it's not a big deal for me, but it's just one of those things that bugs you.  That said, it's very funny to crack jokes about...so it's a plus in a way...7) Oil sensor problem.  I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THIS, but if I did, it would bug me...a little.  It's very easy to clean yourself in less than a minute (if you're seriously sending your body to Nikon just to have them clean your sensor....smh), but again, an issue that the end-user really shouldn't have to deal with.The good:1) Amazing image quality.  I've been really smashing this camera in the above, but seriously, for 98% of your shots, it's an amazing, state-of-the-art imaging MACHINE.  The D600 does not disappoint in the image quality department.2) Better than the D800 IMO, and it's $1000 cheaper!  Better ISO performance, quicker operation, faster FPS (also important to me), smaller and lighter, and it uses the exact same image processor.  Only difference is the megapixel count (24 versus 36), but anyone who knows anything about photography (and perhaps a little about science and engineering), knows that increased sensor resolution is pointless if the lens confusion cannot resolve at that resolution.  Only a small handful of primes can resolve at 20 megapixels on FF, and that's stopped down optimally, using perfect technique (which rarely ever happens--admit it <:p).  36 megapixels?  You're just losing ISO performance with a smaller pixel pitch, and resolving detail that doesn't exist.  The day consumer-level lenses begin to resolve at 30 megapixels at reasonable apertures, I'll consider again whether or not 36 megapixels is worth it.  But this will require some significant, cutting edge research breakthrough in the field of optics (or someone decides to start manufacturing lenses out of diamonds).  Maybe it'll happen, but until then, 36 megapixels is silly.3) Good FPS (5.5)--awesome for a cheap-ish FX body!4) 2 SD card slots.  Awesome!  I know there's this remaining legacy with CF cards, but SD technology has more or less caught up at this point.  I think it's quite weird to have a CF slot and SD slot...and even worse when there's only one (*cough*--6D).  Redundancy is important, you don't want to be that guy that loses all his/her pictures with no backup.5) Built in flash.  Okay, so it's not THAT useful, but there are times when you need it, particularly in flash biasing (fill flash).  An external flash is superior of course, but I don't carry one if I can avoid it, and even if I have it, I usually can't be pressed to take it out for just a single shot where a fill flash is helpful.

Fullframe is the way to go if you are an event photographer or concert.

The dust issues I will go deeper into later, is a QC issues by Nikon.  Will I switch to canon because of it, no.  I got like 10-12 nikon lenses (tamron, sigma, tokina) no way I am a fool to sell everything for money lost on ebay just because Nikon has a brainfart in qc on the d600.  Either buy a d800, d4 or wait a few more months or a year later for a d600.  People who witch have no decent lenses, you know some lens cost more then the camera body.

I think there is 6-10 spots and they cover the whole sensor so it doesn't look like oil splat. Honesty it is very similar to the D7000. I just use the sensor swab as I am used to it (4x with the d7000) by now. Whenever I do HDR or landscape I will clean it before I shoot. Otherwise I shoot at f6.3 or lower most of the time, so it isn't an issues. Oddly the last 10,000 shots on the D7000, I didn't have to clean. Both I don't do landscape much, but I will do HDR. Yes I did called Nikon and yelled at them, but I am fine, I rather clean my own sensor every 2-3x a year. My D40 had it too, but that was when it was getting old.

Though the D600 takes a good picture and has handling improvements in some areas over my D300 I wish I had not bought the product at this point. The biggest issue is that Nikon did not fix the sensor dirt/oil problem when the camera was returned for warranty repair even though it cost me roughly $50 for postage and insurance with about one month turn around. Nikon service representatives assured me that the camera would be fixed once returned to their service center. According to the paperwork they replaced the shutter mechanism. Now they are essentially admitting that the D600 shutter design is faulty with introduction of the D610. There is now a lot of competing product in this space and I doubt I will ever buy another Nikon product.This Fall I purchased this camera and a Nikon 1 V1 and have shot about 6.500 images with both; 3.500 with the D600. I seldom print, rather post to the web. Having both these cameras allows me to kit for a wide range of my needs from light weight hiking to quality landscape and portraiture. I am able to use lenses from the older manual focus AIS Nikkors to the newest AFS models on both cameras.It is quite easy to summarize the niches these cameras fit. It simply becomes a trade-off between photo quality and weight. Without a doubt in most situations I can get a better photo with the D600 than any camera I have ever owned. And it is easier than with my past Nikon or other brand DSLRs. The sensor is phenomenal and the handling is very good. That said the Nikon 1 V1 is easier to use for close-up and down low shots and in long telephoto situations. Where I would be on my belly with the D600 I can just bend down or squat with the 1V1. Mate the 1V1 to a Nikkor AFS 70-200 f/2.8 with a TC-17 and you get up to 918mm  reach in 35mm at f/4.8 with auto-focus...simply amazing.I have the dirty sensor problem with the D600 that many have reported but have yet to send the camera to Nikon. First, I am waiting for the dust to settle (no pun intended) and second, I do not want to be without this camera right now. I have seen posts claiming the problem abates after 3,000 or so shots. I will clean my sensor locally and see. Also the problem does not seem to show up until a lens is stopped way down. Since 90%+ I am shooting at f/8 or wider the issue doesn't have much impact. In those rare occasions I am stopped down and do not want to manually remove the spots, I use the dust-off feature of Nikon Capture NX2 to clean the image automatically.For those of us serious about this hobby our investment is in the glass. Nikon continues to protect this investment by allowing us to use the vast collection of F-Mount lenses with the newer higher-end digital cameras. The ability to have lens and exposure exif data recorded is a big deal to me. Both the D600 and 1V1 do this, though the 1V1 does not provide for the capture of non-CPU lens data. Another important feature is that both cameras use the same battery.

It has the u1 U2 settings that I wish my D800 had was lighter which helps throughout the day and is a lot cheaper which was too good to be true.First, the autofocus points, of course we know they are closer together and less sensitive then the D800, but it is still something that will annoy as you have to focus and recompose more often. I will give the autofocus system credit though. In good light in my testing it was more consistently spot on the D800 after calibration.I had the dust and oil on the sensor issue like everybody else. No big deal, but it was expensive cleaning the sensor so frequently.The colors were good, but at higher ISO's in some artificial lighting the colors would never look right, even with a custom white balance.My big gripe was with the lens mount. I heard that Nikon made body out of plastic so the lens mount was attached to plastic which could loosen up over time with the help of heavy lenses. I thought nothing of that I figured Nikon knew what they are doing and they would not let this happen. After all the 5d iii uses the same type of lens mount attachment. Well I must say after about 1 hour with my 70-200 lens on the camera it stopped autofocusing. Hmm, ok so I took the lens off reseated, I held the camera at my side by the grip letting the body of the camera support the wait of the lens (I know you shouldn't do this but lets face it plenty of photographers hold their camera/lens like this with no problem) and immediately no autofocus!  This was repeated with success multiple times. Now I know maybe I got a dude, but Ryan Brenizer wrote a review on the D600 stating that autofocus stopped on him too and would not come back. The D600 lost my trust. If I exchanged it I would always have that fear of the mount getting loose in my mind. So I returned it.Bottom line, I think for someone upgrading from a DX sensor camera it is a worthwhile upgrade, especially if you are going to be using Nikons new and light 1.8 primes. If you have some nice heavy glass and shoot professionally, buy a new top of the line computer and a D800.The D800 is a great camera, and I appreciate it more then ever now.

At the same time that I upgraded from my Nikon D80 to this camera, I also ordered the Nikon 24-70mm F/2.8 lens (full frame).  The results are stunning photographs that make my D80 images look like point&shoot; quality (well, maybe not quite that bad, but there's a huge difference).  Low-light/less-than-ideal light performance is phenomenal.You may hear of issues with dust or oil on the sensor in this camera, and while I've encountered that issue with mine, I've resolved to learn to clean the sensor since I've begun professional photography full time recently.  I will also say that I had to learn how to identify the dust/oil spots on the sensor because they do not show up in any of my images other than those photos that I took under conscious set of conditions that magnify the spots.  I've also since learned that dust/oil spots are a somewhat common occurrence on other Nikon models including the D800, D4, D3S and other makes of cameras.Therefore, the quality of the images is much more important to me than this temporary issue with dust/oil from the early batches of the D600.If you haven't already heard this, the dynamic range of the D600's sensor ranks only slightly lower than that of the Nikon D800 based on laboratory testing by DxOMark.  The D800 has the #1 ranked sensor with the D600 right behind it.  In many cases the images from the two cameras are difficult to distinguish.  In everyday, practical application, the D600 is getting very encouraging praise from professional photographers around the globe.If you're on the fence on deciding to move into full-frame photography or make a \"lateral move\" from the D700 to the D600, I would encourage you to make the move as soon as possible -- times-a-wasting while you contemplate the options.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "1st review of Nikon D600, Fantastic Camera! **updated w/problems", "Author": "Joe Cho", "ReviewID": "RU8ZBHY6L6Y77", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What oil? what dust? we'll see, but i got refurbished Nikon D600 I am not sure if it's used camera? it seems like new i don't see any sign of usage, but actuation read 4,781.I am hoping this used is better than new in regard to oil and dust problems.I will update this review but as of today 10/17/2013 ISO 3200 at 1/100 shot under low light with 50mm f1.8G was just fantastic....Video Quality is awesome too.I used to use Nikon D70, Nikon D200, Nikon D700, PentaxMe, and SigmaDP2s.Compare to any of the camera in the past it almost feels like downgrade of Nikon D700 in ergonomics, but the size and technical data and pixels are most advanced up-to-date.With my 6 megapixel Nikon D70, i can produce as good shots in good light as D600, but at low light they are world apart.I shall update, within couple weeks or so, but for a day use so far, it's one of the best value for a full frame camera.***update as of today 10/30/2013~I've shot about couple thousand raw. All kind of f-values and all kinds of light exposures and videos.So far no sign of problems other people talked about.Maybe mine already went through it and fixed the issued when Nikon refurbished it, i don't know. but I am very happy with it, for light, small, but powerful. i don't think i need macro lens. 50mm 1.8g's and D600's 24MP details are just fantastic!***Update as of 11/22/2013:Oil/Dust issue present.

It seems like every time they come out with a new DSLR it has some kind of problem.  The D70 (which I own) had front/rear focus issues.  It seems like Nikon got around that buy adding focus tuning on the higher end cameras.  Nothing like \"do it yourself\" QA.  The D800 has left/right focus issues.  The D7000 and now the D600 are plagued by \"internal debris.\"  Do some research on Nikon D600 dust/oil.  Hey Nikon, How about some good old fashioned Japanese quality?  I know a lot of this stuff is manufactured in Thailand, but still.  Get it fixed or drop the price again.Added after the initial review:Last week I spent dozens of hours researching the D600, including trying it out in a camera shop. The folks in the camera shop were well aware of the oil/dust issue. I called Nikon USA service and here is what they told me:1) Not all D600 bodies have this issue. Only some do.2) If you purchase a D600 that has the issue Nikon will take care of the problem. They will clean the sensor.3) If the problem recurs, they will clean the sensor again. If they determine that the body can't be repaired, they \"will see\" if they can replace it. When asked what \"will see\" means, he said that if it is in stock.4) Nikon has not compiled a list of affected serial numbers.5) Nikon doesn't have an understanding of what is causing the problem on some D600 bodies.6) The customer is responsible for the cost of shipping the body to Nikon for the checkout/cleaning.I am sure that this camera takes great photos.  But for $2,000 do you want a camera that may need to go back to Nikon for periodic sensor cleanings?  Nikon, please fix this problem.Added on January 8th:If you want to read more on the internal debris issue, check out the D600 reviews from DPReview, Ryan Brenizer or Thom Hogan.

I don't often return things, but I have to say this is probably the best exchange experience I've had so far.  Amazon made this very easy for me.  So thank you to them.  They deserve 5 stars.*** Second Update ***My replacement D600 started having memory card issues after 50 or so shots, it read -E- for the memory card in slot one, I popped out the card, and popped it back in and it worked fine for another hundred or so shots.  This happened 4 times, then stopped happening and it worked fine for about 500 shots after that.  There were no issues with slot 2.  When I swapped cards between slot and 2, the issue stayed with slot 1.  If it were a memory card issue, I would have expected to see that error appear for slot 2 after a while, but it never did.This combined with my previous experience has me very concerned about the quality of this camera.  I returned it today.

I can best alert you against this camera by copying the words from a recent review.  These are not my words but serve as a good guide.  I hope NIKON will read this and be very ashamed.  I was very lucky because I was able to return the entire D600 camera kit to Costco after I pleaded with them and showed them how this camera is defective and NIKON will not face up to it and instead kicked the consumer in the gut by correcting the problem with the introduction of D610, instead of doing the morally ethical thing of recalling the D600s.  I too noticed the oil and dirt spots on my pictures.  The following is taken from[...] :Here's a quote from a Nikon dealer:\"Nikon has devalued our remaining new [D600] inventory and will make it almost impossible for us to sell it off short of taking big losses. We're already trying to move our current inventory by taking a $100 hit on the profit side and I don't think that's going to be enough. If anyone thinks I'm ordering new D610's today (short of specific order requests) they're nuts.\"Now let's look at things from a well-informed prospective customer viewpoint:  Choice 1: a D600 that might or might not have a shutter issue  Choice 2: a D610 that fixes the shutter issue (to assume otherwise would also be to assume that Nikon is totally incompetent, in which case see Choice 3 ;~)  Choice 3: buy a Canon 6D  Rumored Choice 4: Sony and Pentax introducing competitive full frame camerasWhat I fail to understand is Nikon's behavior here. They have done the following by staying quiet about the D600 issues and trying to get around them by doing a sleight of hand with the D610:  Eroded key customer confidence  Devalued a product by their actions, which leads to:  Lowered their product margins  Added another lingering inventory problem, which also leads to lower profit marginsCoupled with all the repair costs that the D600 triggered, how can Nikon's response be the right answer to the problem? In retrospect, the proper solution was to recall all D600's and examine them for defective shutters. If found, replace it and charge the cost of that replacement to their shutter supplier. That kind of response should have:  Increased key customer confidence  Not devalued the product  Lowered their product margins (cost of shipping cameras, inspecting them)  Not created a lingering inventory problem or the need for another productBut here's another new problem I'm seeing in my In Box. Consider this quote: \"My D600 is coming up on end of warranty. I'm not a heavy user so I'm not sure if my camera has the problem. It seems like it needs more cleaning than I expected. What happens when my warranty expires? Will Nikon still replace my shutter for free if it's defective?\"Nikon is, as usual, will likely remain silent on such questions, which isn't going to increase customer confidence. Basically, I don't think the cycle here has been broken; it's been extended.Oct 8, 2013, 3:54 AM\u00a9 Thom Hogan 2013 / All Rights Reserved bythom.com  @bythom #bythom", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Zero stars not available", "Author": "too_much_crap", "ReviewID": "R1T2CQQRAZULI6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This could have been a fantastic camera had Nikon handles its customers' complaints seriously.

After purchasing the D600 and comparing it to my D800 and D7000 I can say it is almost identical to my D7000 only full frame with some nice little enhancements like faster switching to auto ISO. It has better metering than the D700 but focuses almost identically to the D7000 which in low light is not very good when compared to the D800 or the D4 which focus identically and much faster in low light. The shutter feels a lot like the D7000 and is very noticeable when compared to the D800 or D4. I like the U1 and U2 for saving settings but found that I was navigating the menus more than I did with the D800 or D4. We have yet to see how the real image quality is coming out of this camera as both Lightroom and Aperture don't have support for RAW images as of this date and pixal peeping JPGs is not a good indication of the capabilities of the camera. ISO seems to be better than the D700 but is somewhere between the D7000 and the D800 and doesn't even compare to the D4 for image quality or low light capabilities.Having used the D600 for portraits, reception photos and general photography I will be returning it. It feels too much like a D7000 for my liking. That being said if you have a D800 or D4 and are looking for a second camera this may be a good solution. You may end up being frustrated with ISO WB and other settings that require a complete mind change from a Pro body.Good: As a second body, nice MP without going crazy (D800)Bad: As primary Body, focusing in low light,4 starts is all I can give it as it lacks a lot of the Pro features that have traditionally gone along with a full frame camera from Nikon. If you want a full frame D7000 with extra MP and very good dynamic range than this is a good camera for you . Keep in mind however that Nikon has a cost per click that is almost identical for all their cameras so just because you're not paying as much initially doesn't mean a good deal.

After spending so much on a camera you'd think there would be little room for disappointment. The reasons for this are listed in the subject line of this review. I wanted to love this camera. I read all the reviews and was super impressed with it sensor quality ratings from DxO Labs, but have come to learn the hard way that there is so much more to a camera than what the lab results produce. We live in the real world not a lab.My biggest gripe is the color reproduction. I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say the colors are awesome. Perhaps I'm color blind! I used to own a Canon 7D and never had a problem with the colors. I even took the dive and bought Capture NX2 to try and get the best color reproduction but still can't get what I'm looking for. I should not have to edit every picture that comes out of the camera.Second big gripe is the aperture in live view. When I'm in live view and want to make adjustments the screen does not make adjustments. I have to exit out of live view first and then turn it back on. What a pain! Again, for the price of this camera this should not be!Third is the use of the camera. This is a personal preference I realize but I'm always fumbling around with the camera trying to get what I need it to do. It's not very user friendly.Finally is the horrid oil spots on the sensor. Are you kidding me? How much did I pay for this camera again? Another side note that I've noticed is on the lens side of the deal. Nikon lenses are much heavier and more expensive than the Canon counter parts. I can speak to this because I've owned both. Also I thought 39 focal points was so much better than the Canon 6D's 11. But in reality the 39 focal points are so cram packed together in one small area in the middle that they are a nuisance and I switched the D600 back to a smaller number of points for speed. Oh and one more thing, I thought the pop up flash was the deal breaker for me. Turns out that since Nikon lenses are so big that I get a huge shadow from the lens in the pictures. So again the \"specs\" cannot determine your purchase. You've got to use it in the real world.

I'm coming up from a D90 which is a Nikon DX body.  I had specifically been waiting for a updated full frame FX from Nikon that was not as old as the D700, then the D800 came out.  Wow the D800 is a totally awesome camera, but it's not for me.  It's $3k price tag and 36MP just seemed to be too much.  I kept my fingers crossed and hoped for something a little less expensive.  Now that the D600 is here , I believe it's going to be a great fit.Build Quality - The D600 is part alloy and part polymer (plastic).  It's physically larger then my D90, weather sealed and feels very solid in my hands.  How a camera can feel relatively light  and solid as the same time is default to explain, but the d600 is just that.I think it's worth noting that my D90 was all plastic, I shot it in all sorts of conditions and put it through  70,000 shutter actuations without a single issue.  I'm happy to have the upgraded frame of the D600, but it might not have been necessary.  I'm not going to Afghanistan any time soon.Handling - As you can imagine, it's bit different from my D90.  I like the position of the new focus selector near the base of the lens mount.  The mode dial on the top right will take some getting used to.  There a two layers to it.  The top is for setting shooting modes M, A, S, P, Auto, No Flash, Scene, U1 and U2.  The lower dial is used for selecting single/(low&high;)continuous shooting, remote/timed shutter release, quite mode and something labeled 'Mup', which I don't know much about yet.  Both dials have physical unlock buttons that prevent accidental mode changes.  I think the U1 and U2 (custom) settings will be a great feature once I have them configured.  The buttons on the back of the camera to the left of the LCD are similar to the D90, although Nikon switch the order of the '+' and '-' buttons.  I'll probably press the wrong one about a 1000 times before a start getting used to it.  There are a few other differences aimed at enhancing video control.  Due to it's lack of autofocus, I never really used my d90 for video.  Since there have been so many enhancements to the D600 video functionality, I'm willing to bet that I'll find those new/updated buttons useful.There's nothing the d90 had that I'll miss, but I do wish the d600 had dedicated buttons for ISO, WB, and QUAL.  Unfortunately, those are only available on the D800 up.  Also, I have big hands and would probably have preferred a little larger body.  The D600 is definitely larger than my D90.  I'll purchase a bottom grip once their available and I think they addition will be just about be prefect for me.  Not sure if this belongs in 'Handling', but I can't forget to mention the viewfinder.  Since I was going from a DX to and FX, I was really looking forward to the increase in size.  The D600's is significantly bigger and brighter then my D90 and real pleasure to look through.  I would have like to see Nikon use the same circular rubber eyecup that's found on the rest of their FX cameras.  Hopefully there will be a 3rd party equivalent that is compatible with the D600.Auto Focus - Need to take more pics, will provide and update in a few days.Image Quality - Based on the few shots that I've taken, I've been impressed.

Sharpness. Well, due to RC commenting about the auto distortion control, I have discovered what it was that caused my softer than normal images.So, I am now upping my rating to 5 stars as it performs as I would have expected. Kudos to RC, and remember that if you experience soft images, try turning the AUTO DISTORTION CONTROL setting to OFF.Orignal review below:I received this today and of course wanted to get used to it. Used the battery from one of my D7000 cams and began doing my usual Nikon body setup for my taste.The shot story is, I am returning it since the images we all soft. NOT AF I think, but soft. Checked settings, tried the same lens on the D800, and it just is not sharp like I have come to expect from my Nikon bodies.I was really looking forward to this one too...I tried stopping down, just to see if it helped, but alas, it was softer than the images from even my D3200 with the same lens.On the plus side, it felt nice in the hand, was very responsive and had a good feel in operations.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "qingning", "ReviewID": "R3K6KTHMQ6ZS9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "update the core processor is the greatest part of the camera.good for megood color and nice shot sound.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wrong specification in the title of the product", "Author": "peevee", "ReviewID": "R36Z5IS2HKDPYM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product name is\"Nikon D600 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Kit with 28-300mm f/3.5-4.5G ED Nikkor Lens\"Amazon, there is no such thing as \"28-300mm f/3.5-4.5G ED Nikkor Lens\".

T", "ReviewID": "R3U7CJ789SG4C1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I honestly would have bought this camera if it wasn't for all the issues that happen that is of no fault of the user.  But because of this, I own a 5d instead and there are no issues at all with it.There is one huge difference that separates Nikon from Canon when it comes to fixing problems that occur when they get screened by the public.  Canon acknowledges the issue and then fixes it.  They don't wait to update that model for next year or the next few years.  Nikon does not do this. If there's a problem with your camera they will not even acknowledge there's problems that need to be addressed and they will not fix it in their product line until an updated camera comes out to replace the one with the issues.Canon had a flawed Light Leak issue that went on dpreview when people started to report metering changes from the back of the camera. Canon acknowledged this and fixed it right away.  All subsequent models were updated so this was NOT an issue for later models after it was fixed and it was also ingrained in the serial which ones were fixed and which ones might still be affected.Nikon has known about the oil spots / dust on the sensor for a long time since it went viral on a youtube video and when dpreview reported it to millions of people who viewed the site. That was back more than 9 months ago.  But it's not just the d600 it's with a good number of Nikon's products.  The d800 has a bad left focus point. It's white balance is off and it casts a green screen tint that is not up to viewing spec when you want to accurately gauge what the picture might turn out. In the production world this is called monitoring and without a monitor, you have no clue what the output will become when you capture it. Sadly it's not even these two cameras. The d5100 (a recent camera came out 2011) had malfunctions where the image would go entirely black even though the camera was still taking photos, this was a malfunction and there was no fix for this issued by nikon. Users of that camera just had to wait for it to be updated with the d5200.  Nikon did not care about the customers who bought the d5100 and never fixed the issue. Not just cameras that suffer from these issues, but their flashes as well. it's been known that Nikon's $500+ SB-900 flash was overheating and needed a lengthy time to cool down. This was a big problem and a lot of users complained about it.  But Nikon doesn't fix it, they ignore it and wait for the release of the update where the problem gets addressed. And they don't lose money and probably make more money because everyone who was tired of the SB-900 overheating just went to buy the SB-910, so they probably doubled their profits because they got to sell 2 flashes to the same individual.Nikon just does not care about it's customers. Until they start treating their customers with respect you should not have faith that what you bought has been screened and assured that it will not have some type of issue or malfunction because Nikon is strict with its warranty even though it knows of flaws that come out of certain products.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "What about a product's brand Nikkon?", "Author": "Amauri Ribeiro", "ReviewID": "R2CWCTH0A6B2AW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What about a product's brand Nikkon?
