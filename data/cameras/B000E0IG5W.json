I'll give you a pro and con list for this individual camera.PRO:-It's a convenient size. Small but not so small that its hard to hold.-The controls are easy to figure out when you first get it.-The pictures are clear.-The zoom works well.-The menu is pretty clear to understand.-It comes with batteries (not rechargeable)CON:-It takes longer than 2 seconds to take a picture. If you're getting something that moves, it might go away before the picture is taken.-If you want to see the pictures you've taken, you have to turn the camera off if you want to take another picture afterwards.-The screen is small. If you have bad eye sight, this wouldn't be a very good camera.Overall, i love the camera. Its very convenient for me but if you're more of a perfectionist who wants the best camera, get a canon powershot.I hope my review was convincing.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "B+ camera; very good, almost great", "Author": "Trojan LRey \"trojanlrey\"", "ReviewID": "R3IRFXWICMZ9D9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just wanted a decent pocket size camera with better features than the typical bottom end price points to take along on my frequent trips without adding more weight.  This fits the bill.Features you'll like most are:- very forgiving at the widest angle; crisp, clear shots- ability to choose 5 photo modes, including manual exposure adjustments- decent battery life if using high quality (I got 200 pictures plus 3 direct downloads into my computer after 50 to 70 shots)- the fact that only 2 AA batteries are needed vs 4- decent optical zoom and tolerable digital zoom- great imaging without a flash in a wide variety of lighting- fairly reliable shots when in AUTO mode if you don't like messing with settings- great super close ups using MACRO mode- ability to directly connect to computer without use of special software; most computers will recognize it as a data storage device- portability and reliabilityFeatures you'll wish were a little better:- less shake when using zoom (can overcome by using 2-sec timer + tripod)- glare on LCD- viewfinder fairly useless since it's not really an SLR; can't reliably focus when only using viewfinderFeatures that would make it better:- fast shutter mode or ability to take at least 3 consecutive shots- anti-shakeI have several other digital cameras. I knew enough to try different techniques to get the most out of my pictures.  In general, most of the shots I kept were above average.  Out of the first 200 shots I took, I thought 75 were keepers.  But I tend to shoot the same subject with 3 or 4 shots expecting to only keep the best one.One weird quirk.  I used max zoom to take some shots from an airliner.  I could never get the shot in focus on the viewfinder but I squeezed the shutter anyway.  The captured image shows for a second or so and was remarkably clear.  So, it's a little bit of a guessing game when on max zoom. Shoot it anyway.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Won't find a better camera at this price", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Science Teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R16PL8794YNJES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I must say I have warm feelings about the Fuji brand. I owned a finepix 2600 and a 2650, and they were fabulous cameras; served me very well. I'm a bit rough on things (like cameras), so I never feel good about spending a ton of money on things that might break;These cameras are inexpensive gems. My first FinePix made it through the mountain bike trails [Translation: can take rough handling] of Colorado just fine. Unfortunately, the sandy beaches of Oregon [Stay away from sand] proved to be too much for the worm gear on my zoom lens. My second camera recently died after a fall from a great height. But before expiring, these 2 Megapixel beauties cranked out literally thousands of great shots. Now I've replaced them with the A400. My opinion? It's just like the 2600/2650, but with twice as many pixels! Quality pictures. Easy to use. Very similar interface, but with some pre-programmed modes (Like portrait, sports, night) that tweak the auto function so that these exceptional situations will turn out better. At this price point, no other digital camera can compete. Simple as that. The memory card from my 2650 works just fine in the A400. From the easy-to-use main menu, I can change image quality to fit more pictures on the card, or I can make the pictures easier to upload to the web by changing the pixel density (I still have dial-up!). It's easy to dump pictures I flubbed. The comment (see reviews) I read about having to turn the camera off to switch from image review mode to image capture mode is really just a user error--lightly touch the shutter button to exit the picture review mode. It's easy to transfer your pix to the computer; the software and hardware they ship with the unit can be deciphered in about 2 minutes. You won't get to work for National Geographic using this machine, but you will be able to fill up a couple of impressive scrapbooks. And one more thing: Using the camera in movie mode (Especially if you move it around) creates wonderfully nostalgic pictures akin to the 8mm home movies of the sixties. (No sound, for sure, but that's why I own a digital movie camera!). Have fun!

Compact size approx the size of a deck of cards.  Has an optical viewfinder which is a vanishing feature on consumer cameras.  Uses easily available AA NiMH rechargeable batteries, and can use alkalines in a pinch.  Camera has good color saturation on captured images.  Only flaw I've found is that it lacks a focus assist lamp for low-light focusing.  Menus are easy to navigate without too much clutter.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great digi cam", "Author": "J.

Even easy to see in the bright sun.Good easy to follow menu system.great zoom opitcal and digital.(amazing for digital, not grainy at all)just the right size to hold with one and take a great pic.CONS:Eats batteries. after about 100 photos with flash on, the batteries are dead.uses XD, its kind of exspensive memory type(around $30-$50 for 1GB)The controls to navagte the menues are kind of un-intuitive. My other half still hasn't figured them out.I would say that this is well worth getting for the price. We over came the cons by getting rechargable batteries, just dealt with the memory, and the navagtion problem, just need to get use to it. This is our first digi cam and we are very happy. I would say this is a great little cam for going out and just having fun taking photos.^_^", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm Finepix A400", "Author": "A.

Here in two days. Happy with that. About my only complaint was the fact that it doesn't have a removeable card to go get photos printed, but I probably didn't read the description thoroughly, so my bad. But its a nice little camera for beginners. I'm not real technical, but its been easy to use and the photos are easy to load into the computer. It does eat batteries fairly fast, so I have finally invested in some rechargeable ones.

It was my first digital camera and has seen several states, suitcases, vehicle consoles, glove compartments, and floorboards. I have not had a LICK of problems with this camera, that is until my cat knocked it off the table one too many times. This camera has found the floor/ground many many many times, and I guess this was the last straw. The camera itself worked, it just couldn't focus  because the zoom lens was stuck....(focus error). But back to the important stuff: For 4.1 megapixels, the pics come out great. I have posted many pictures on \"auction sites\" and \"social sites\" and have always had complete clarity. One thing that I don't really care for is that it takes 2 AA batteries. For the first while, I would use regular batteries, until I used approximately 874 of them. Then I got those rechargeable kind, which were a pain, and didn't seem to last long. Some people like cameras that take AA's - I don't. As far as being easy to use... absolutely. It doesn't have all kind of extra crap you'll never use. You can use a USB cable to get the pics onto a computer, or a memory card, which will slide into the side of a computer (laptop). I do wish the camera took pictures faster... I like to take pics of my dogs, and by the time the camera takes the picture, the dogs have already moved, which ruins the picture. The screen has never given me any problems, no scratches or black spots. What camera did I buy to replace this one? Fujifilm Z20FD (10 MP). I figured for a few more bucks, I get over twice the megapixels, bigger screen, and a sleeker design, yet with the same good, reliable name brand.", "Date": "November 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "A 4.2 that is lacking", "Author": "Robert G.

I must admit, I didn't do my homework on this one.  While for her, it's a great little camera that fits nicely in her purse and she carries it everywhere, the camera does well in high light situations but in low light levels, it is severely lacking.  I don't have the availability of a flash meter to measure it's output, but the tiny built-in flash puts out a tiny burst that isn't very effective at more that 3-4 feet before it falls off sharply, and there is no hot shoe or off flash option available. The implied 4.1 MP resolution should be producing crisp lines, etc. but it's been very disappointing so far.  I have seen better quality prints from plastic disposable cameras available in the kiosks at tourist attractions.  The other bad news is that it takes the XD memory card instead of the SD or one of the other popular cards and sticks.  I've found them rather difficult to find.
