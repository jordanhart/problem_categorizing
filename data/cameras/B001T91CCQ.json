Basically, it's a relatively high resolution camera, in the manual it says it will take a 2 GB SD but I'm currently using a 4 GB. Unfortunately, it takes AA batteries and eats them like candy and also forgets its settings every time you turn it off, for instance, its default save location and the auto white balance setting (which in my room makes everything WAY too yellow so I have to use the incandescent setting).Summary: If you're paying $115 for it, find something better. If you can find it for cheap and are a basic user, this won't explode.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! PAINFULLY SLOW!", "Author": "M. Brown \"Brownie\"", "ReviewID": "R15CKVI8ZZ46HA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had 7 digital point and shoot cameras. This is the first Polaroid brand I have owned, and definitely the last. This camera takes almost 30 seconds just to turn on and be flash ready. No one wants to wait for that long so that you can take a picture. Then it takes about 20 seconds to recycle so that you can take another. I called Polaroid's tech support who told me \"try not to use the flash and it will recycle a little faster.\" What a joke!My wife has a 10MP digital Canon point and shoot. It takes 2 seconds to start up and 3 to recycle, and on top of that the pictures turn out much better.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst Camera In The World", "Author": "Jenny Ingles \"Jenny\"", "ReviewID": "R2MJP167BQJAR4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I couldn't be more frustrated right now. I've never used a worst camera in my life.I got it a couple weeks ago, and have yet to be moderately impressed. It's slow. The manual settings are a joke.The focusing is the worst I've come across. I've barely used it and it has stopped focusing all together. The green bar tells me my image is focused, but it's a giant blur.I keep batteries in my purse at all times because it eats them so fast.The pictures are always grainy and gross.Honestly, I wish I was joking, one time use/disposable cameras produce better results.Do not waste your money or your time. If anyone wants mine, I'll give it to you for free just so I don't have to think about it anymore.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "WOW! Terribly slow! DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!", "Author": "N.

I found it online for $70 without shipping and thought, \"how bad could it be for $70?\" The answer is, \"really bad.\"1) Doesn't manage SD memory well. Gives errors that onboard memory is full during video capture even though SD card is inserted and formatted.2) Slow to start. Almost 20-30 seconds.3) Slow to capture. 10-15 seconds between captures even with a high speed Sandisk SD card and dropped down to the lowest resolution.Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "trying to help", "Author": "Sarah Knight", "ReviewID": "RY319WN76AWFL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unfortunately there were not many reviews on this camera when I purchased it a year ago, but I am hoping my review will help others make a more informed decision regarding their camera purchase.I have owned plenty of personal-use cameras over the years, but never one that has frustrated me more than this polaroid.  The main faults are:-As others have already mentioned, it takes the camera on average 25 seconds to take the initial picture and about 10 more seconds to \"recharge\" between shots.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!  The only way to speed up this process is to turn off the flash - not an option when trying to photograph anything that is indoors and alive.-Every other time I turn on the camera (and even sometimes between shots), I receive an error message about the camera being \"card protected\".  I then have to turn off the camera, take out the SD card and put it back in before I can take a picture.-The picture quality was much better on my older cameras (and although I don't recall what mp they were, they weren't a 10).-There are many features and settings to this camera, but they are not easy to set-up or use, and the camera resets itself every time it's powered off.-And to top it all off, the camera is now undetectable when trying to transfer pictures to the computer.Hope this helps!", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "decent beat-up camera", "Author": "J.

Like others who have posted, I too have noticed a long start up time (around 20 seconds).  The pictures are decent, but considering the camera is a 10 MP camera, it is disappointing.  The pictures are grainy, even on the highest settings, unless there is good light.The video does have sound, but like the rest of the review, I can say the sound isn't the greatest, but for a digital camera it is decent.Like the title says, this would be a decent camera as a secondary, say if you go hiking and don't want to take a nice camera, but not good enough to be considered as a primary camera.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very decent camera for the price", "Author": "D", "ReviewID": "R2ALMOHYG2KX98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I first bought the pink 7.o polaroid to take pics for ebay.nice camera, but not sharp enough on tiny item details.but,I liked the camera, so I bought this one.It's wonderful!I am someone who can barely point and click, so I am obviously not a camera expert, but I know when it's the camera and not me,that makes the photos look great.the screen is nice, the macro setting is easy, even for a noob,and it takes detailed pics of fine features like beading.I also got it for 60 bucks, which makes it even better.I would recommend this camera for anyone who does not know a lot about settings,ect...but needs a good camera at a great price.I think that the polaroids are underrated.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "This camera truly is a \"roid\".", "Author": "Scott D.

The camera let me down at an important time.  I had 9th row seat for a concert I was looking forward to, and wanted to snap a few souvenir photos.  Before leaving the house I put a brand new pair of batteries in the camera, and a spare pair in my pocket.  When I tried to take a picture the camera said the batteries were 2/3 full, then refused to take a pic and shut down.  I switched out the other pair, same thing happened.  Eventually it would turn on, but as soon as I tried to use the flash, or zoom in, it shut down again.  Any button I pressed caused the camera with brand new batteries installed to shut down.  This camera has turned me off from any Polaroid product.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slow, can't plug into wall, eats batteries fast, poor handling of blue shades, won't turn on many times.

Well, maybe some of them are. Not this one. This particular model is VERY slow between shots (ie you have to wait a ridiculously long time to take the next photo), you can't plug it into the wall outlet so it eats expensive batteries fast, it's got poor handling of blue shades which causes me to have to process each and every photo in a graphics program afterwards, many of the pics are less than sharp, and this camera won't even turn on many times.

Naturally, he didn't save the receipt, so I just put the camera in a drawer and went back to using my old one.  Well, this week that old camera broke, so I called the Polaroid service telephone number, and they were absolutely no help.  She kept saying that since I didn't have a receipt, the camera wasn't covered under warranty.  I reiterated that I wasn't asking about a warranty, I was needing tech support.  She said that I had called tech support number.  When I asked about repair services available, she said they had no authorized repair dealers.I was hoping a tech guy could have given me some suggestions to get the flash working again, or told me where to send the camera to get it repaired, but no.So I won't be buying any more Polaroid products.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera makes me sick", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R1ELT2UQ61B7GL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for over a year now. Honestly I haven't had a lot of experience with cameras at all, so i just thought all digital cameras were this crappy.Pretty much what the other reviewers have already said - it's very slow for the flash to build up (10-15 seconds), it eats batteries like crazy, it keeps saying \"card protected\" even though it isn't, and i have to take the sd card out and put it back in for it to work.This is an awful piece of machinery.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good camera, cheap,asy to use for us simple NON pro-photographers", "Author": "Victor A.

It takes forever to 'warm up.'  The delay between pictures is slow.  I've handed it to family members to snap pictures and they all shake their heads and give up because it takes so long to focus.  When reviewing pictures, it always takes you back to the first picture.  For example, if you want to delete a pic while reviewing, the camera takes you back to the first picture after your selection is deleted...then you have to scroll through all the pictures again.  The pictures come out grainy, too bright, or too dark.  I've played with every setting and still can't seem to get a decent picture.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Regrets", "Author": "B.

It chewed through the batteries in exactly 7 minutes and 30 seconds. Put some fresh ones in so I could put the video on my PC and watched it. There was lots of crackling, hissing, and popping in the audio and the picture kept going light and dark as it tried to adapt to varying levels of light. I then took a few pictures and found that unless you are in sunlight or other very bright light the picture quality is absolutely abysmal. Lots of mega-pixels does not equal good picture quality.
