{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great entry level camera. Affordable not cheap.", "Author": "mcenut", "ReviewID": "R3RFJJ18B3W9YN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Photoshot A430 is the replacement for their entry level digital camera the A410.  Canon upped the megapixels to 4.0 from 3.2, enlarged the LCD to 1.8\" from 1.5\" and added more zoom (now is 4X optical and 14X combined.)  Even though this is the lowest priced Canon digital camera you can buy it is in no way cheap.  The camera feels solid when you use it and yet the plastic body keeps the overall weight down.Like all the A series digitals from Canon this model still uses standard AA batteries (2 to be exact.)  So when you are at the amusement park with the family and your batteries go dead, stop off at the gift shop and pickup a couple of alkalines to get you through the day.  I highly recommend investing in a set of good quality NiMH rechargeable AA batteries though; they last about 4 times longer than their alkaline counterparts.Like the A410 the A430 also has the DiG!C II processor.  This fabulous processor allows the camera to power up and shoot its first picture in less than 2 seconds and keeps shooting the next pictures approximately 1 second each.  There is a burst mode too but I haven't had time to play with that feature yet.  The DiG!C II processor also uses less battery power than older digital cameras so your are able to shoot more photos, and view them on the LCD, before you need to swap them for a fresh pair.  I took about 150 pictures, with the LCD on, on a set of alkaline AA batteries before they needed a change. That was a \"WOW\" for sure.Having owned two previous digital point and shoot cameras and one digital SLR model, I can say that I am most impressed with the A430.  Some online reviewers have noted that the camera lacks independent zoom buttons.  What Canon did on this camera was make one set of buttons do multiple things.  The same toggle button you use to move up and down in the menus is the zoom in and out control when taking photos.  I applaud Canon on this design.  Why include more buttons that you need.  You aren't using the menu buttons when taking photos, so why not use them for the zoom control.  They aren't confusing to use and actually simplifies the design of the camera.This camera is great for grandparents, young kids and someone on the go.  It's is simple to use and takes great photos.  I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a digital camera that plain and simple just works.  I may just buy two of them so I don't have to share this one with my wife.Warning: Personal rant follows!  Before I bought this camera I read several online reviews.  The most deceiving was one from a noted electronics review website.  Their resident computer geek stated that there was nothing special about this camera and it was larger than most.  Having owned and used this camera I suggest their reviewer stop playing online video games and get out in the sun more, because there is something wrong with his head.  True, this camera isn't the smallest model around, but it is very small. And to buy a camera that is smaller you must pay two to three times the cost of this model.  \"Nothing special?\" gamer boy?  I'd really like him to qualify that statement.  The A430 comes loaded with over 14 shooting modes, an impressive 0.4\" Macro mode and the best photo quality in its class.  If that is nothing special I'd like to know what is special.  I don't expect a sub $200 camera to out perform my $1400 digital SLR.  Perhaps gamer boy needs to RTFM.", "Date": "April 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great mix of value and quality", "Author": "Jon \"Jon\"", "ReviewID": "R19VPUU1HLP8BN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few months ago - my first digital camera and as a college student it has been great.  The pictures come out great, the videos are high quality, and the various modes let you choose how complicated you want to make it. The software is simple to use if you can work a computer at all. The zoom is powerful and plenty for most people. I like the shape of the camera because it is easy to put into pockets than more square cameras and if you want a better size be prepared to pay up.Make sure you get rechargable NiMH high power batteries - I bought sony models and they have amazingly long life - I have only had to change them once! I got the canon soft case for the a430 too - it is pretty compact so it still fits in my pocket.  Overall its a great value camera that I am glad I bought.  As a college student, I wanted cheap but I didn't want to get the cheapest camera I could find, so this seemed like a good balance of quality and price and will last for a long time.

Clarkson", "ReviewID": "R24JV3NGFJVNEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my old Canon A40 2 megapixel model, which served me very well. I think the Canons are a cut above the rest of the competition in terms of both quality and value.This camera is quite a bit smaller and lighter than my A40 and uses two batteries instead of four. But it is not too small. The smaller S series can be a bit too small for large hands, as another reviewer has already pointed outThe Digic II processor is very capable and much faster than my older model. Image quality is really superb, especially for a camera this inexpensive. I have made excellent 8x10 prints from this camera. 4 megapixels is fine when you have a good lens and processor. The image quality beats my friend's 6 megapixel Sony hands down. The only negatives I can see are that the resolution of the LCD is merely O.K. when compared to more expensive models and that the flash takes a good 5-6 seconds to recharge between shots.In sum, this camera is an outstanding value for an entry level shooter who wants to take great digital photos without too much cost or fuss.", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "best buy for the money", "Author": "Eric Beich \"be kind.\"", "ReviewID": "RHQH1Y3ERF5HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third digital camera in 10 years and my first canon. I shpped around and read several reviews and made this choice and I am very happy. as others have noted its a great quality camera for the price. I have gotten several comments about the size of the camera already, and the great pictures it takes. Amazon had the best price and I trust them but I purchased a 1 gig SD card for a price I cant really list, suffice to say.. shop around for  an SD card unless you just want to buy everything at the same time, then get a 512 card at least. They are so cheap these days. Another bonus for me turned out that my Bonzai USB drive uses SD cards and I am now able to take my card right from the camera and plug it into any computer to access my photo's quickly. I'm not sure if any other brands of USB drives use a removal SD card, but its something you may want to look into. oh ya, even though I'm pretty \"geeky\" the camera was easy to pick up and use right out of the box with minimal manual reading, so it seems to be very user-friendly. and the size is perfect! I actually expected it to be bigger. rock on Canon!", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Battery Life!", "Author": "Nicholas B. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1JX5PI2IT4Z50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This sleek model is excellent for its low price. I was able to take 250+ pictures with two 2500 MA-h NiMH batteries. It's very reliable, and it's always a relief when you can have your picture taken by someone else, and not have to worry about batteries dying, modes not being set right, having to push special buttons, etc. The camera allows the simple option of point and shoot for those spontaneous moments, but also has complex options to choose from like saturation, exposure, etc. for when you're feeling artistic. Indeed, the pictures don't turn out blurry, and the processor has gotten fast enough for you to be able to take larger-sized pictures every two seconds. The delay between pushing the button and taking the picture is a miniscule 0.1 seconds.This camera is great for most recreational photographers. The 4MP quality is adequate, and this camera doesn't leave me begging for higher resolution. The important thing is that the pictures turn out clear. I also encourage people to purchase rechargeable NiMH batteries; they're better than NiCad, and you'll save money in the long run.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Product from Canon", "Author": "Tarun K.

If you compare this camera with other brands this gives 4X optical zoom for a low end Camera at the same time it comes for a cheap price. It also has a ton of features. I think 4 mega pixel is a lot for the digital image clarity. Last year i brought a Nikon 7.1 mega pixel, though it gives good quality pictures but the problem was it has delay in the shutter time which is so irritating so it not really good posing in front of the camera waiting for the flash to come.

I'm so impressed with all the functions and features and the quality of them.  This actually takes almost the same quality of picture as my Fuji S3.  I was very reluctant to give them to my kids because of the compactness and the quality.Pros: Small, big LCD, lots of fun features like color swap, super-macro is beyond compare, amazing picture quality for a 4mp, runs on 2 double A's, perfect as a first digital camera for kids or adults.Cons: A little on the heavy side, flash takes a little longer to recharge than most other cameras, menus can be a bit confusing at first, memory card is in the same compartment as batteries.Bottom-line: For the price, you really can't go wrong.

They are by far some of the best images that i have seen yet to be produced by a digital camera and i am extremely impressed. At christmas last year, i received a Polaroid digital camera, and was very dissapointed at the picture quality. The pictures were grainy, and discolored, and i was not pleased at all. So, the Canon Powershot A430 is a very large step up!When i opened the camera package, i actually expected to find a much larger camera, but to my suprise, found a very nice sized one. It fits snugly into the palm of your hand, and has no rough edges. The design has a nicely finished look to it, and is very presentable.The on button is very easy to find, and when pushed, instantly turns the camera on. Compared to the Polariod camera i had before [ which, for the on and off button, you had to push down for 5 seconds ] this was very pleasing.I didn't find the Canon Powershot to be a terribly hard camera to use. After i took it out of the package, i started to use it right away. There are images on the camera that may need a little research [ looking into the users guide ] but they are not hard to get used to.I especially like the different modes on this camera. They are a very nice feature. One that i really like is the one that makes a certain object stay its certain color, while everything else around gets set to black and white.There are loads of feeatures on this camera, and i would HIGHLY reccommend it to anyone. It was definitely worth the price.One thing i would suggest is buying a higher Megabite memory card if you are planning on taking a lot of pictures. This camera only comes with a 16 Megabite, but it can still hold enogh images to satisfy.Overall, this camera is great.", "Date": "June 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "First time Digital Camera Shopper", "Author": "cbl", "ReviewID": "R3B6KRV3W6KSJO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just want to start off by saying I know nothing about pixels or Mega whatevers, i just wanted a camera.

I actually purchased 4 (yes I was that impressed with my old A400) with the other 3 being Christmas gifts for my family.The bottom line here is simple; it takes great pictures.  You can read all you want about features and specifications, but this is really all that matters. The pictures are remarkably flawless with faultless focusing and excellent lighting, it is hard to describe how important this is to me after previous experiences with digital cameras.Most of the time all I need is something I can take out, turn on and snap a memory of a moment which may disappear if I need to fuss with settings.  This camera does just that time and time again.  Believe me, with 4 family users and a brand new grandchild this thing has been put through its paces.  Yet, it also has a number of advanced features, a good range of modes, and the video feature works well.  My only complaint is that the `point and shoot' mode works so well that I hardly ever use the others so tend to forget how to!Between the 4 of us we have technical ability ranging from Barbie to Geek but all of us love this camera.

My main issue with it? The software doesn't allow you to print multiple pictures (or multiple copies of pictures) on the same piece of paper.  That means that if you want a bunch of wallet sized photos to give to people, you CANNOT print them on the same page, but would have to print each individual picture on its own individual piece of paper.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R166ERVBJCE14X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for a few months now, and so far I'm very happy with my purchase. The main factor for me in deciding on a camera is the quality of the pictures. The A430 delivers 4MP. To an amateur like me, this does not seem like much. Actually it seems outdated compared to other cameras out there. But once the photos were taken, I was amazed at the clarity and resolution. The resolution is more than enough for amateurs/hobbyists(?). The colors are vibrant and sharp, although there are some noise/grains with blacks. Plus, you can record movies...with sound! The quality of videos isn't spectacular but gets the job done (rather grainy in 640 mode [largest]); it's not something you'd make a movie with, but perfect for places like youtube. I believe you can get ~15 minutes with 1GB in 640x480. So for someone who takes pictures just for fun, it has nearly everything you'd want.pros:great pictures: high-res, vibrant, and clear; good flashgood body constructioneasy to use (low-med learning curve)awesome battery life (with rechargeables)good video feature for a cameracons:bulky (much more than it seems) (I suggest A500 series when it's on sale [slimmer profile])small screenslowdowns when zooming in and movingThings to note: I suggest at least 512MB of memory. With that much, you can take as many pictures as you want without feeling constricted. Memory is really cheap now. Brands such as SanDisk are too costly - there are MUCH cheaper alternative for the same size card, same quality (buy online).", "Date": "February 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Cam for it's bracket", "Author": "L.

He is computer literate and mostly uses the camera to save images to his computer and to share in e-mail.The factors that led me to chose this camera:1. Canon reputation for good quality. I had previously purchased two of the Canon Powershot S series cameras and have been delighted with them.2. Combination of good optical zoom (4x) and reasonable megapixels (4 MP...my friend doesn't print any photos, so 4 MP is more than enough for someone who shares pictures by e-mail and views them on a monitor).3. Use of AA batteries in this camera: the purchase of disposable AA batteries would be a financial hardship for the friend who received this camera. I was able to buy a $20 Li-MH battery set and charger (which accepts 240V European electric current) at Costco so that he can have a virtually unlimited (and cost-free) source of batteries and take all the photos he wants.4. Subcompact size was not an issue, as he has very large hands and would have trouble using the small buttons on most subcompact cameras. While a larger video screen would have been nice, most cameras that offer large screens also crowd the buttons so close together that they can be difficult to use for those with large hands or arthritis. He does not travel much and mostly uses the camera at home, so the ability to fit neatly in a small pocket was not an issue for him, and the larger size (vs. a subcompact such as the Canon S series) was actually a plus for him.I also bought a 512 MB SD card (PQI brand, about $15) to upgrade the camera, as well as an USB card reader (also PQI, $8) in case there was a conflict between the English language drivers and his Eastern European version of Windows (there was a conflict but the card reader solved this); no drivers were available in his language.Photo quality has been excellent, as least as good as my \"S\" series camera. Manual mode allows control of some functions such as flash and ISO speed. So far he hasn't made use of the pre-set \"scene\" modes, but you can take excellent photos without using the pre-sets.For $128, the best value I have ever seen in a digital camera. The only reason I would not buy one for myself, should my current camera break down, is because I travel frequently and it is important for me to have a camera that is truly pocket-sized (if not ultracompact).", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great little point and shoot", "Author": "M.
