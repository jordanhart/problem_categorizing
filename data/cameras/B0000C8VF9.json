{"Reviews": [{"Title": "As we expected...an excellent follower!", "Author": "Luppapa", "ReviewID": "R2QZ9JS6BS876A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon A70 was the biggest hit since it hit the shelves.So everyone had high expectations about Canon A80. I think everyone should be more than satisfied with Canon's new model. If A70 was the best compact camera in it's class, then A80 is the best of the best. If you try the camera I am sure you will agree with me.I don't want to talk too much about the techical issues, you can read it on the official pages and on several digicam review sites.Let's talk about what made me return to Canon, may be it can help you decide if you are new to digital photography or just have a dc of another brand and cannot decide.I had the following cameras in order: Canon A40, S40, S400 then switched to Minolta F200 and finally returned to Canon A80.I would like to explain to you why I went from one to another and why I think that A80 is the best of all.First, I need an entry level quality digital camera at a low price, I got the A40. Then I would have liked more megapixels in a more compact metal body, I got the S40. Then I went for a subcompact light weight dc with brand new technology (DIGIC) and fast performance (S400). Then I realized that I miss manual controls and need sharper pictures and got a Minolta F200. Finally, realized that F200 has a very high battery consumption and an extremely high noise even at ISO100. I bought an A80 this week for several reasons: I saw some pics and used some cameras of differend types, and think that Canon is the BEST in the compact middle-range category. All the reviews and tests I've read about A70 was positive, so I had no doubt that A80 will be even better. One thing I was unsure about is the quality of the LCD on A80. S400 had sharper and darker LCD, but A80's is still better than average and I think satisfies most people. Don't bother with the resolution of the LCD if you read different numbers on web pages, it is nice and clear.The flip-out and twist LCD is a big advantage to others: not only you can use the LCD when shooting over people's head or on the floor, but the monitor can be easily protected from scratches. I can't explain how big this advantage is till you see and try it yourself. Good work Canon!If you know Canon digicams, then you know how fast are Canons. A80 is no exception, this is by far the fastest camera I used beside my S400. If it is up to Canon, you won't miss an important shot!And there are all the things you've already read about: 4MP,3x optical zoom, full manual control, AF-Assist lamp (great!) etc, etc. You know it! :)Some questions and answers:- Shall I upgrade from A70 to A80?My answer is: YES. The more megapixel and the new flip-out LCD worth that plus. Also, the construction adds more quality feel to it (there are more metal).- Shall I go for A80 if I have no digicam yet?If you can afford, definitely. But consider that A60 and A70 are also excellent machines when you are on budget.- Shall I change to Canon from a different 3-4-5 megapixel compact digicam?Definitely yes. May be some other cameras are better in some issues than Canon, but all in all Canon makes the best consumer cameras to date. Usability, image detail, low noise, faster than average performance are important things and A80 has it all at a very good price.One very important thing: don't let you fooled by the sharp pictures of Minolta and Fuji. They have a very high noise that are annoying. I tried to remove the noise with some photo editing software, but the result was a washed picture in all cases. Some say that Canon has no sharp pictures. This is true, the competition may be sharper...BUT! you can always add some unsharp mask with the right software and make Canon images look excellent. Unfortunately, you cannot do the opposite with those \"sharp but high noise\" cameras. Keep these in mind always!Another thing: chromatic abberration and blown highlights. Yes, it's there. Not always, but there. And it were there in my S400, S40, A40 and even my Minolta F200 images as well. It is there in almost every compact digital camera. This is NOT an issue, though some are complaining about it continiously. No camera is perfect and no will ever be.Decision is yours. Take it in hand and you'll never want to give it away! :)", "Date": "October 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Quality counts  - cheapest doesn't mean best", "Author": "VTRocker", "ReviewID": "RF7WZRT331BN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research prior to purchasing the Canon A80 digital camera.  I read a lot of reviews, many right here at Amazon.  I also looked into lens quality and the quality of electronics.  I read consumer report's test results.  The bottom line - as with most things in life \"you get what you pay for\".  You can find cameras with more than 4MPs, however, my research indicated that the picture quality may not be as good as Canon's 3MP A70.  Digital picture quality is a mixed bag of tricks.  MPs are one part of the \"picture\" when determining what quality a digital camera is going to deliver.  I will give you my advice in each of four major purchasing catagories below.Retailer:  If you take nothing more from this review, please listen to what I have to say here.  The cheapest price is not always the best deal!!!!  In fact I would go so far as to say that the cheapest price may be the worst deal.  While searching for the best price on an A80 I called four of the cheapest retailers listed at sites like Pricegrabber.  EVERY store I called was either out of cameras (surprise, surprise) or the price quoted was only good if the camera was purchased in a overpriced package.  The \"cheap\" store would then proceed to try and sell you what \"they had\" - not what you wanted.  After four attempts at the cheapest price, I went back to Amazon and found a price of $359.00.  This price was $50.00 or more than the cheapest price, but they told me if the camera was in stock and gave me a delivery date.  I actually purchased through an Amazon affiliate.  I received the product on time and in good condition.  Camera brand:  I touched on this above.  Again, the cheapest product is not always the best buy.  Don't be fooled into believing that MPs alone or a fancy zoom equate to good picture quality.  If you don't plan on spending in the $300 dollar range, plan on mediocre results.  Now...many people will argue that a $100 camera will deliver good results - it depends on why you are buying digital.  If you are buying digital to replace conventional cameras, why would you want anything but great quality.  You cannot go back in time and take another picture of your child at age 2.  I went digital to begin replacing my conventional cameras. Canon is not the only good brand, but it certainly rises to the top of the heap in the quality for dollars catagory.  I would stick to companies that make photography their business - Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Minolta, ect.Camera model:  Do your research and have a clear picture in your mind of what you need a digital camera for.  A digital camera is like a computer - it's great when it works, but a nightmare when it doesn't.  Again, don't always look to the selling price as the determining factor in selecting a model.  If you stick with a major manufacturer you are less likely to get junk or poor service, regardless of the model you pick.Many people stress out over the choice of an A70 or A80.  I don't think you make a bad purchase with either product.  I decided that, for an increase of $80, it was worth the upgrade to the A80.  Your own budget may make this decision for you.Price:  I discussed this many times over.  Don't let anyone convince you that a $100 dollar camera takes the same quality pictures as a $300 camera.  Buy smart and buy for the long run.  Buy quality and service.  Do your research - read Amazon reviews and search the web for independent reviews.  Pick up a Consumer Reports magazine.My opinion of the A80 - Well...after about a week of playing with it and reading the manual(I'm not finished yet) I believe I purchased a quality product with features typically found on high-end cameras.  A word of caution - don't fool yourself into believing that you can move from \"point-and-shoot\" to this camera without first educating yourself.  I think many people foolishly believe that perfect pictures can be taken by simply pushing a shutter release button - not so in the real world.  If you educate yourself about the functions of camera parts and read Canon's manual carefully, I believe you will find the A80 to be an excellent product.  I hope this helped.", "Date": "January 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "First Digital Camera.......WOW!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R38IJD22Z0DMUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I've been a purist 35mm SLR user for a while now and the expense of getting films developed was getting tiresome.  After 2 months of research, online, in stores, borrowing various other types of camera I've finally plunged into the world of digital with the A80 and it's been worth the wait.  I can't see how digital can improve anymore.  I had narrowed the selection down to the A80 and the S50 (DSLR not necesarily being out of my price range, but more than I was willing to commit to for the first digital).  The S50 and A80 are very comparable, but I chose the A80 for the following reasons:-1) It felt better to hold, as a right hander, the grip is very comfortable, the S50 felt like holding a brick, no ergonomics.2) Easier Controls.  The menu controls are more intuitive and seem sturdier than those of the S50.  The A80's 4way button is a lot larger and easier to use than the S50's 'nubbin' along with the other buttons.3) The flip out screen.  While at first I thought it was 'gimmicky' it has proved to be a very useful feature, enabling excellent framing at angles other than eye level.4) AA batteries.  Need I say more???  Much more practical.5) I wasn't so sure about the sliding lens cover on the S50.The only things that made me even consider anything else:1) 4.0 Megapixels.  I was worried that the 4.0 megapixels wouldn't cut it for enlargements, but I've just had a 10x8 printed on the 2nd highest resolution setting and it's perfect!  I have no doubt I'll be able to go up to 11x14 if necessary.2) RAW format.  OK so now I know that I can enlarge as much as I can with the A80, I'm not worried about being able to record in RAW format.3) The S50 has a slightly larger screen, but the A80's flip screen more than makes up for it's SLIGHTY smaller size..P.S.  The A80 can record video in NTSC and PAL, useful for me with relatives on both sides of the pondI'm very happy with my A80 and would highly recomment it for first time and experienced digital users.....  Good price too.", "Date": "October 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "As usual, the best range of consumer digicams by Canon", "Author": "avi555", "ReviewID": "R1TY6NMYWP20SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You just got to hand it to Canon to come up with the best package cameras in the market today. The A60, A70 and A80 provide huge feature sets at a very competetive price.Regarding the camera, my A80 let me just say that it performs admirably.I was initially choosing between the A80 and also the excellent  Canon S45, but decided on the A80 for the foll reasons:1. Superior handling - the A80 just FELT better to hold in my hand, due to its protuding grip, than the S45. However, i recommend you try both cameras out before you buy. You might prefer the S45 instead.2. Flip-out-and-twist LCD - The A80's real ace over the S45. Initially, i thought it to be a gimmick, but i found out that the LCD is really useful in everyday situations, e.g. taking photos of kids from a low level without breaking your back. BUT, the A80's LCD is also a bit dissapointing, as it has only a 1.5\" size and 67k pixels, compared to the S45's 1.8\" and 100k+ pixels. See for yourself, and decide if you are comfortable with the A80's LCD. I wear glasses, but have no problems with it.So the choice is yours. Both cameras are priced about same right now, i think.Back to the A80, here are its pros and cons:Pros:1. Good handling and feel, Sure , it may not be as small as a Pentax S4, but come on, the camera is more 'prosumerly' oriented. Is small size is what you look for, you'll HAVE to give up on many advanced manual controls.2. Good quality images. People in forums have complained about purple fringing and excessive red-eye on the A80. I find a bit of fringing too but it is not that noticable. And redeye? I've seen none of it even with flash shots.3. AA batteries seem to run on and on and on...... 2100 mAh cells lasted about a week with 30 or shots a day with LCD turned on.4. NO E-18 errors which plagued the Canon A60 and A70!5. Flip-out-and-twist LCD. Really useful.Cons:1. people say the the CF card door is flimsy, but in fact I find the Battery compartment door to be even more flimsy. I wonder when the springs will break off.2. Shutter lag: This plagues almost all comsumer digicams. I've learnt how to handle it thought, by adjusting my timing, but it still annoys me.3. A bit low quality LCD as i mentioned earlier. Some of you may find it to be a problem. It works fine with me.So, all I can say is that the Canon A80 makes a very strong case for itseldf in the 4 megapixel comsumer camera market. However, if price is a hassle, you can also try out the 2MP A60 or 3MP A70, good performing cameras in their own right. In the 4Mp category, also be sure to check out the A80's competitors i have listed below:1. Canon S452. Nikon 43003. Pentax S44. Kodak DX 64905. Canon S4006. Sony P92 ( a 5MP model)7. Canon S50 ( also 5MP)For the Canon A80, i recommed the following accesories, which should be definitely bought:1. 128 MB ( at least) Cf card. 256 MB is a good size.2. 2 sets of rechargable Ni-Mh batteries, (each set having 4 batteries)of about 2000 mAh and a fast charger.3. Camera pouch/bag. The Lowepro Z10 which i bought for the A80 provides a snug fit.", "Date": "February 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fantastic + Versatile!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RJENPZJZVTILE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped around for a digital camera for a few months, 4+ megapixels is the way to go, other cameras looked nice but were too pricey, ergonomically awkward or confusing to use.  Not so with this little gem!  The canon A80 has all of the features I wanted, it is small (hand size), easy to use, takes HIGH quality pictures and gives me confidence to experiment and enjoy photography without wasting money on film & developing costs.  The A80 is very simple to use, the menus and function screens are navigated with ease.  The camera offers a wide variety of modes for every situation and setting.  The A80 can take movies, landscapes, macros, portraits, high speed action pictures, photo-stitching-panoramas, and many more.  The A80 comes with software for both PC and Mac.  Although I tend to use the iPhoto program that comes with my Mac.  I did buy some rechargeable batteries and charger, and a couple extra memory cards.  The A80 uses 4 AA batteries, you should get some Nimh recharge batts as back up.  You might also want an extra memory card, the camera uses Compact Flash (type 1) cards, this type of card is inexpensive compared to other flash storage cards, a 256mb card is a must in my opinion since the A80 is sold with only one 32mb card.  The A80's only drawback is that it does not come with a camera bag, it has a camera strap, but no bag, so I had to buy my own.  Overall, I have to give this camera 5 stars, it does everything as advertised, and the picture quality is FANTASTIC, simply follow the directions for each type of picture you are taking et voila, HUGE digital prints, the detail is phenomenal!  This camera is worth every penny!

White \"Minamu\"", "ReviewID": "RW9MKBNLEGYIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I knew nothing about digital cameras, but after researching and reading many reviews, I decided on this one.  I was also considering a Nikon and the full Kodak package with the printer dock.One clear standout feature is the LCD screen.  I almost never even look through the viewfinder anymore.  It allows you to take shots with much more ease and more quickly than you would with just a viewfinder.Another thing that's good is that you can use the auto feature if you don't want to have to worry about any details, just want point and shoot, or you can switch to many other modes if you want more control over things, as you learn how to use the advanced features.  Thus, no matter how skilled you are, you can have great pictures.  I also like that there are all sorts of easy to use effects, like sepia and black and white, panoramic/stitch together.  You can be pretty artistic right away.  You can also take 3 min. movies with sound.The software is easy to use. You just install it on the computer.  The cables come for you to connect the camera to the a USB port, and when you do that and turn on the camera once the software is installed, it instantly recognizes the camera and asks if you're ready to download pictures.  Once you do, they are saved to a folder and you can view them, manipulate and edit them, and even send them directly to an e-mail message.  The program interacts directly with my MSN browser automatically.  You can also create little booklets and albums and cards and things with the other software that comes with the camera.  I can't wait to get a color printer cartridge and some photo paper to see how that works. You also get a cable to view your pictures on tv.BTW, a friend of mine has the Kodak system and is generally happy with the camera and quality of pictures, but said that the software often messes up on their system.I don't know if all software does this, but I like that you can take some pictures, download them, take some more pictures, and the software knows only to download the new ones even though the others are still on the card. Picture quality is typically excellent.  I took some very casual pictures of my son just fooling around the house, and I was amazed at the clarity and color that was captured.  His skin looked beautiful, and his pink lips and each long eyelash were captured stunningly, making me wish he didn't have on a juice-stained shirt.  He seemed to look better on the picture than I even noticed him looking in person.  I am sure that soon the house will have professionally developed photos of him all around it that I've taken.I'd highly recommend the camera to anyone who likes ease of picture taking and good results, plus the ability to grow as a photographer also.  You will not be disappointed.One thing that I was concerned about after reading reviews was that the battery compartment hatch might be fragile.  It isn't, you just have to follow the arrows telling you how to open and close it, because you have to slide a lever over and THEN lift, and there's a little spring so that when you close it, you have to push and then slide back over.  It is different than other compartments, but you have to follow the instructions, and it's not hard at all once you do it once.  Don't let that scare you.  It isn't flimsy at all, and it's not going to break easily.  You just can't be ham-handed with it and forge ahead without noting what you need to do first.I would buy the soft case for it, available for under 10 bucks I think on this site.  I didn't go for the full kit because I found a fast charger that was cheaper, and NiMH batteries from anyplace will do.  I have 8 NiMH batteries, and I keep one set charged and in the front pocket of the case and one set in the camera.  These batteries last a good long time, but using the movie feature can eat through them more quickly.I'm totally satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "June 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Outstanding value - High-end features", "Author": "Pauly Long", "ReviewID": "R20MBCGMG8EXPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say enough about how much I've enjoyed this camera.  I actually lost it for two days (note: don't put digital cameras in checked luggage) and decided that I'd use the airline settlement to upgrade to a better camera.After comparing to many of the 5MP cameras in the $500+ range, I realized that the A80 matched those cameras feature-for-feature in nearly every category (except MP of course)!  Just when I had resolved to re-purchase the very same camera, the airline found my bag and I got my killer camera back (everybody wins)!My favorite high-end features:* Picture stitching (make one HUGE picture by combining several individual photos) right on the camera* Multi-point auto-focus - note that you need to pay attention to where the camera tells you it focused -- you may need to adjust your shot* Corrections for white-balance, EV compensation* Nice tight macro shots!* It's not a digital camcorder, but with a large memory card, the camera takes a pretty decent full-motion videoand most importantly ...* Put the dial on \"P\" and it takes perfect pictures 99.9% of the time!Other features I like:* The folding LCD is great - protects it from scratches, allows you to hold the camera at funny angles but still be able to see your shot* Uses 4x AA batteries.  You can find AAs just about anywhere, and you don't have to carry around a charger!* Heavier construction makes for a nice solid feel -- doesn't feel cheap.Minor gripes:* The little viewfinder is pretty much worthless as far as I'm concerned.  You just gotta use the LCD.* People have complained in other reviews about shutter lag -- it's true, but you can learn to compensate for it.  Keep in mind taking a picture with this camera is a two-step process: 1. Frame up the subject and hold the button half-way down to get the picture and the focus set 2. Once #1 happens, push the button the rest of the way down to fire the shutter -- it's almost instant.I've decided the delay with this camera is the focus time and/or exposure calculation.  Once you've got the green focus boxes on the LCD, you're ready to rip!* The multi-point auto-focus sometimes makes \"interesting\" choices in what to focus on.  If you have a tough time getting it to focus on the right thing, you can always scale back to center auto-focus and force it to focus on what you want it to* The LCD is great, but they really coulda made it just a little bigger ...Your first three purchases after this camera should be:1.  LowePro z10 camera bag.  Perfect fit and it only costs about $102.  A 256 MB (or larger) CF card.  Save the 32 for trips to the drug-store when you order prints3.  8 rechargeable NiMH batteries.

Snyder \"AZMom\"", "ReviewID": "R7DU6PMJ5UBJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a mom of a toddler and also a scrapbooker so I wanted a camera that would take excellent pictures.  The Canon A80 is a bit more than I needed~ I am a point-and-shoot person and didn't care to get involved in manual modes.  The Canon is fairly small and easily fits in my diaper bag~ it is a bit heavier than some other cameras but this is due to the fact it takes 4 batteries, which are well worth their weight in battery life.  Even in auto mode I can take excellent pictures~ I've taken close up shots of my pets that just blow me away with how detailed they are.  The colors are gorgeous and true to life.  This is my third digital camera (had Kodaks before) and I can honestly say the quality of the pictures far surpasses the other two cameras I have owned (the CX6330 and the DX4900).I do have a few complaints, though~ first, the flash is a bit TOO powerful.  When I take pictures of my toddler (my main photo subject) I have often gotten shots where her eyes are half-way closed, resulting in a kind of 'drugged out' look.  It was suggested to me to turn off the red-eye reduction (a preflash which could be making the subject blink) and this has helped somewhat, but I still get an occasional 'drunk' look.  I have compensated by staying farther away from my subject and using zoom.  The flash output can be adjusted but ONLY in manual mode, which I find irritating (I think this should be something you can adjust in auto mode as well).  The only other option is to turn off the flash, which is not always possible indoors.My other complaint is the shutter lag~ there is a LONG delay between the time you press the shutter button and when the shot is taken.  This can be avoided if you press the shutter button half-way and do a 'focus lock' first and keep holding it half-way until you are ready to take a picture.  The problem with this is when you have a toddler that is on the move you don't want to be chasing after her and worrying about doing a focus lock; also often you have just an instant to take a picture before a toddler moves her head/walks away/etc and pictures have been lost due to this shutter lag.  While all digital cameras have some shutter lag, the Kodaks I owned were MUCH, MUCH faster than the Canon, with almost no lag whatsoever.  I wish Canon would improve upon this!  If Kodak can do it, I'm sure Canon can.There are a few ways to try to speed up the shutter~ by turning off AIAF autofocus system, turning off red eye reduction, turning off the flash, or going into manual mode (I learned on a camera site how to go into manual mode and program 'snap mode' which has a faster response time)~ however these all can compromise the picture, especially in low-light conditions.  It can result in blurry pictures.Aside from those 2 complaints, I am very happy with my Canon A80.  I've resigned myself to learning the manual stuff so I can have control over the camera~ I know once I am comfortable with the different settings I will probably be able to overcome the issues I've had, however I really would have preferred to stay in Auto mode.  It doesn't make sense to me why in Auto mode you cannot even adjust the color settings (vivid, neutral, etc.), however you can adjust these in the P mode or in manual mode.I seriously considered returning my Canon to get another Kodak b/c of the two issues above, but I honestly find the quality of the A80 far superior to the Kodak line.  I did a ton of research on camera review sites, as well as looked at many picture samples from Pbase Photo, and the Canon just takes breathtaking pictures.  As I'm growing in my knowledge I'm finding I'm taking much better pictures and working through the few problems I've encountered with shutter lag and flash output.Oh, one more thing~ the battery life is outstanding.  I use my camera a lot (!) and I am just in awe at how long it lasts before I have to recharge the batteries.  It is simply amazing! All in all, I think this is an excellent camera for both beginners and pros alike.", "Date": "April 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "A80 vs. A70", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R38B6ALZTKIJLA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: Before I begin let me say that I love taking pictures but am a total amateur and will not be able to explain the fine technical diffrences.I have had an A80 for 4 months now. I got it for a cheaper price than Amazon through bizrate.com at a NJ camera store. I made sure it wasn't one of the bait and switch stores through user rating and reviews. They did ask me to buy accessories but when I declined they just sent me the camera the next day. I had an A70 for about 8 months before I got caught in heavy rain and the camera CCD was damaged due to the water after giving me about 3000+ good pictures. So I went to buy another camera and thought of buying another brand and model. However after some heavy research I came back to Canon as I love the Photostitch and the other manual and photo modes. So I bought the A80 and here is the difference between A80 and A70 through the eyes of an amateur.A80 is heavier than the A70 and the corners are less well rounded. Its squarer and is surprisingly heavier than A70. But you get adjusted soon and I like the weight as I don't carry it in my pocket anyway.The plastic parts of A 70 have been replaced by metal in A 80 which explains the weight and it has a more solid feel to it and is more resistant to scratches.The flip out screen is a good addition and I have twisted it in another angle about 25% of the times. For example when you want to capture a group of people from the outside. Then you can hold it above your head to get the center of the group and still compose your shot as you can see the screen. Or when you are taking pictures of kids and don't want to neel on the ground. You can just lower the camera in your hand and twist up the screen. The same goes for landscapes. It does allow for more creativity in composing shots.The rubber flap which covered the outlets for your cable has been reduced to about 1/5th the size. And there is a better navigator button which allows you to scroll through pictures/menu etc. In the A70 the 4 buttons at the back also serve as the navigator buttons. Now they need not.And the on/off button which was very flush with the top in A70 is more raised in the A80 and more easily found in dim light. The picture modes have not changed much over the A70 except there are now 2 more modes C1 and C2 which can be customized to your liking. The biggest difference however is in the 9 point AiAf autofocus. I see that the indoor pictures taken by A80 on Autofocus are 'harsher' than the A70. Outdoors I do not see a big difference and the pictures taken in daylight are as clear as the A70 but the indoor pictures are quite different. The white is whiter than it was in pics taken with A70 in autofocus, if you know what I mean. Overall, I like the A80, especially as I got it for only a few bucks more than what I bought the A70 for (from Amazon). But I haven't quite figured out how to use it to its full advantage especially indoors.

I purchased this beauty before studying in Mexico for three months.  As a student, price was a large factor.  I wanted more than just point-and-shoot.I took 700 photos in Mexico.  The camera never missed a shot.  Photos all come out so perfectly you don't even need ot access the many manual options.  The only manual option I used was the black-and-white, which took black-and-white pictures and gave me control over exposures and the like.  My black-and-white prints look better than my friends', who used 35mm cameras.  My color prints, well I blew a bunch up to 8x10 and they are absolutely perfect, amazing considering I wasn't even using the highest-quality option!I love the swivel-screen.  When traveling alone, you can have the screen on the front of the camera and take a picture of yourself.  It was also helpful for seeing over large crowds.  The camera is NOT heavy, I don't know why so many reviws say that.  It's heavier than other digital cameras, yes, but I like that it feels SOLID.  I have picked up many digital cameras that felt flimsy.  This one is solid metal, very strong.  I love that it uses AA batteries, because if your batteries run out its always easy to find more.  If you use energizer e2 batteries the camera is very light.  Batteries typically lasted me 2-3 weeks, and I was taking hundreds of photos.There are a few cons to the camera.  The screen is hard to see in direct sunlight, and it feels a little too small.  Also, I find that the knob on the top to choose picture-taking options moves too easily - I often moved it unknowingly and then took a photo on the wrong setting.  I also find that the auto-focus often focuses on the wrong object.Still, I would buy this camera again.  My friends' cameras simply did not compete.  I had so many more options, and my auto-shoot's pictures were just better.  When we compared prints, you could not tell mine were from a digital camera but there's had imperfections.Buy this camera.

It's my first digital camera, and it has exceeded all of my expectations for a reasonably priced digital.You see, I'm a film person who prefers his film cameras all manual for the control it gives me.  So, as you can imagine, I have been very skeptical of digital.  I held out for several years before buying a digital camera in part for this reason, and in part because until recently I could not find a digital camera that met my needs at the price I was willing to pay ($300-$400).  The Canon A80 is that camera, and I'm very happy I waited for it.  Since your needs may not be the same as mine, I should explain what I wanted in a digital camera:at least 4 MPfull manual controls along with the automatic onescompact size (I take most of my photos while hiking)reasonably rugged and well built (for the same reason)excellent optics and picture qualityuses AA batteriesgood battery lifeA fairly tall order, but the A80 fits the bill.  It's small and fits really well into my hands, making it easy to handle even one-handed.  I considered the Canon S400 and S50, too, but their proprietary battery and less ergonomic shape (and the lack of manual controls on the S400) tipped the balance in favor of the A80, even though the A80 is slightly larger.The A80 takes great pictures on program or automatic settings, but allows full manual control, too.  I have found, to my embarrassment, that I actually use the manual controls rarely (they are rather cumbersome on the A80--lots of buttons to push--but I'm still glad I have them).  Shutter lag is minimal compared to other digital cameras I have tried out, and the automatic focus works very well.  The A80 also takes spectacular closeups in macro mode.  The flip-out LCD has turned out to be far more useful than I expected, and also protects the screen when folded in.  I do not care much about, flash, indoor shots, or moving subjects (I shoot mostly landscapes) so I can't say much about them, except that it is nice to have these capabilities, and I have gotten a few great shots of wildlife with the A80.Battery life is excellent.  I use 1800ma NiMH rechargeable AA batteries in it, and though I have shot all day on more than one occasion (250+ shots), I have not yet run out of power in the field (I always start out the day with a fully charged set of batteries).  The fact that it takes AA size batteries makes for cheaper batteries and greater flexibility when your rechargeable NiMH batteries run out of power and you have no charged  replacements.  My only quibble is a tendency to blow out highlights (bright areas) of some photos, and some purple fringing where dark areas meet much brighter areas in a photo.  I understand there are adjustments one can make to avoid both, but I have not yet achieved this level of expertise.In short, this was a great choice for my first digital camera.  I'm having a lot of fun with it and discovering that in some respects digital gives you even more control over your photos than my old all manual Nikon does.

The A80 is 4.0 MP, which gives you the headroom to create slightly larger prints, at least up to 8 X 10 with excellent quality.Canon has rethought the user interface on the A80, and the camera is simple to use.  The \"Auto\" setting works quite well for many occasions, but there are plenty of setting for special situations, or complete manual control if you want it.

I also didn't want to have to worry about lens scratches or LCD scratches. I wanted a camera that could fit into a jacket pocket. Finally, I wanted a rechargeable Lithium battery. I have a Canon point and shoot film camera and was always impressed with the quality. As long as you are not getting into German lenses like Leica and Zeiss, Canon and Nikon are the best. I happen to be partial to the Canon but it is a preference thing. Canon has been tinkering with digital models for sometime so I figured they worked out all the kinks. And so far it's been great. The image quality is fantastic. I bought it for a magazine project and plan to blow up images to 8x10. I have been in publishing long enough to know what I have seen so far is going to look very good blown up. For vacation shots, etc. it is all you could want.

It can be that, but if you know a little about photography, you can get some creative, unique and professional looking results from this model. It takes some learning because there are sub menus and settings but the basic principals of photography are intact. The lens folds away when the camera is off and the swing out LCD snaps, face in, to the body. This is the only model I know that has this and I read a lot of reviews where people were bothered about their LCD getting all messed up.

I just wish the batteries were rechargeable like on other Canon models. Everyone knows these things gobble batteries. But realizing the rest of the camera was what I wanted, I figured some rechargeable AAs from Radio Shack would take care of the problem.

I'd refrained from buying a digital camera, limping along with a point-and-shoot 35mm instead because the resolution didn't seem great and the prices seemed too high.  With the birth of our first grandson though, I suddenly felt the need to own a digital camera!  Without too much research I bought the A80 and I'm totally satisfied with my choice and maybe even a little pleasantly surprised by some of the extra's.  First, just so I don't forget--it takes great pictures!  Really great pictures...I feel like the only limitation is my own ability to completely use all of the available features.  If you're reading the other 50 plus reviews you'll see a lot of technical info, so let me just hit my own personal highlights.  It doesn't come with a bag...but I got a great small Samsonite camera bag with snaps and straps and pockets and zippers for less than $6.00 at Walmart.  Any digital camera will eat batteries--go rechargable.  The best I've seen are 2300ah NIMH batteries, you'll need 8 and a charger {Walmart again} which will pay for themselves in a month or two (and trust me, when you do break down and buy it you're  really going to kick yourself for all the money you've been wasting on regular batteries).  The memory card they provide is too small, but at the second highest resolution, it will get you started with 30+ pictures and act as a interim backup.  I like the 256mb size as an upgrade, and will eventually buy a second one as a backup.  Sandisk had a price for well under $50 and a lifetime guarantee--so the backup card could come in handy if yours ever fails!  The camera comes loaded with features, including manual shutter and aperture modes and more automatic and manual modes than you will learn to use in weeks if not months or years of ownership.  In the meantime, just setting it on Auto or Nite mode makes you look like a freaking genius anyway.  The flip-out LCD screen is one of those things that you don't know you need until you have it, and then you wonder how you ever did without!  It protects the delicate screen when not in use, rotates so your wife can take centered pictures of herself (instead of the off-center ones she usually got with a regular camera), and it is great for candid pics when you don't want to spook the subject by looking directly at them with the camera or when you want to alter the angle of your photo to get a bugs eye or birds eye view.  The USB connection to my computer is a huge improvement over the floppy disks the Mavacia used and even a full card of 256mb downloads quickly (plus you can upload pictures to transport them to another computer).  The included software for cataloging and modifying shots is adequate and actually quite an improvement over what I've seen in the past.  Considering that it's free, I'm not complaining.  {If I want better software, I'd rather choose what I want anyway.}  I started this review by noting that I'd been holding out for a high resolution camera with a decent price--I got that and more.

Although the alkaline battery give poor power, the high capacity AA NiMH rechargeable batteries last at least 200 picture talking with LCD on.

That said, given the price point of the new(er) Canon Powershot A80 digital camera, most recreational users will not find a much better camera with the multitude of features for the price. And, consumers seem to be proving Canon right given the immense popularity of the A80, an enviable successor to the extremely popular A70.The basic A80 package comes decently loaded, but you'll definitely want to spring for a few goodies (upgrades). The basic package comes with the camera, cabling (A/V and USB), software (for photo manipulation), and a 32MB CompactFlash card. The first few items I purchased (actually concurrent with the camera purchase) were:- a 512MB CompactFlash card,- Canon A Series Accessory kit,- Canon conversion lens adapter (for peripheral lens transition),- Canon wide converter (wide-angle lens), and- Canon tele converter.While most recreational photographers will easily be able to get by with the standard A80 bundle, I would recommend strongly the Accessory kit and wide converter (which will require the conversion lens adapter). The Accessory kit has a custom-fit A Series case, but more importantly, it has a compact battery charger and 4 NiMH rechargeable batteries. Inasmuch as AA alkaline's life expectancy is relatively short, rechargables become a must. The wide converter translates into much better landscapes and group photos. The A80 comes standard at 38mm, while the wide converter improves this to an advertised 24.5mm, a significant improvement. And, while the memory upgrade and telephoto addition can wait, the others, at least in my opinion, really make the A80 sing.Some of the really cool features of the A80 include: the swiveling LCD (a fabulous addition to the A Series), a built-in lens cover (eliminating the need for a lens cap), and, of course, the infamous Canon lens expandability. For you skindivers, Canon offers a waterproof case, allowing you to take your A80 up to 40 meters underwater (advertised).For me however, the nicest convenience is the fact the A80 is PictBridge-enabled allowing direct printing to photo printers (supporting PictBridge-which most photo printers do these days). If you haven't seen the direct photo printers yet (printing directly from your camera to a photo-quality printer), take a look. They'll knock your socks off!Canon's software bundle appears to be at the head of the pack, which includes access and compatibility for both Mac and Win users. Mac afficionados will love this and feel less discriminated against to boot!The absolute only issue I have with the A80 is the lack of compatibility with an external flash unit. The onboard flash is...adequate.All-in-all, the A80 is a little hotshot in the mid-priced digital market.

My neighbor, who is a professional photographer, was so impressed with the color and clarity I was able to get with this little camera that she is thinking about getting it for the times she doesn't feel like lugging her heavy camera equipment around.  The only down side to this camera is what I feel to be a slow \"reset\" after each shot.  I couldn't really get a quick sequence of shots on some things that I really wanted to, but luckily the quality of the pictures I did get almost negates the necessity for it.

From other reviews, you might have read its great features. I would like to address some issues that were mentioned in other reviews:1. Weight and Size:Depending on which digital camera you used before: if you used a heavy one before, this one is as light as a feather. But, if you used a \"credit card sized\" one, this A80 will be big and heavy. A80 is not very light, but not heavy at all. It fits nicely in a lady's palm. It will not fit into a shirt pocket. What'd you expect for a 4 Megapix camera?2. Speed:Not as fast as a SLR, but among the fastest group in digital cameras. It can be easily controled...another plus.3. Media:Compact Flash is the mainstream. Olympus uses XD. There is hardly any card readers for XD media. Although Olympus also produces great cameras, I don't want to touch XD since I'll also be using CF for my PDA and MP3 players.4. Power saving function:A70 has a bad function: the power saving function cannot be controled by the user. If you turn on the camera and not use it for a while, it will turn off automatically. A80 corrected this by putting in another function for you to turn the power saving on (not off!).

I have heard some concerns about the rubber part of the USB connection, and its really no big deal if you take care of it, it plugs neatly back into place.

First, it is fairly large, compared to the elf and other cameras, but it is not HUGE, it is smaller than a typical film camera, yet 100000 times better.

I just bought the camera yesterday and I was impressed with the level of detail once I view my photos on my pc (you can also connect the camera to your t.v. but I haven't tried this yet).This camera will not replace my 10 year old trusty Minolta automatic/manual camera yet, but once I figure out all the settings it might make some sense to leave the Minolta at home since I'll be able to blow up my photos to a large size.............sample photos taken with the A80.I looked at digital Fugi, Milolta, and Nikon and I loved the A70. The store had sold out (apparently so did many others!) so I had to spend an extra hundred. I'm sure I'll make this money back with the amount of film processing I'll save this holiday. I'm glad I got this camera over its predessor because it comes with the latest USB (faster downloads) as well as the latest compact flash card (32 instead of 16mB) although I bought a 128 (and will probably buy another 128). The 4mp photos require alot of space. I also tried a 30 sec (up to 3 minutes) mpeg and the camera was very intuitive. I took 70 shots in and outdoors and 3 small movies 1 hour after charging my batteries (not included - I bout a 30minute Energizer charger kit). The software for the photos is easy to use. The movie editting software doesn't appear to be that great. I don't plan on recording movies extensively with this camera, but it's nice to know this feature is available if I left my Sony Handycam at home.I look forward to taking many photos with this camera and recommend it to anyone whose looking for a camera that doesn't feel like a toy and will challege any photo enthusiasts out there with its many features and manual controls.

They are of such quality that enlargement prints of 8 x 10 or even 11 x 14 are possible with no image degredation.This camera does pack a lot of features into a fairly compact package.

I have taken well over 100 shots most with flash and the LCD display illuminated and the batteries still had juice.A wonderful feature on this camera is the flip out LCD display.  This may be the most underrated feature on the camera.  The display is capable of flipping out, rotating and pivoting so you can hold the camera in all sorts of creative positions but have the display adjusted so you can see it.The image quality that this camera produces never fails to impress.  Nearly every time I am showing someone some shots I took with the A80, they make comments like, \"How come my camera doesn't take pictures that good?\".  Colors are rich and the contrast is very good.There are only a couple of negative points about the A80 that I have discovered.  There is a slight delay between the time you press the shutter button (button to take the picture) and the time the camera actually snaps that picture.  It's probably less than 1/2 second, but occasionally when I have wanted to snap a quick shot of something moving, it was unable to capture it in time.  Not a huge problem, but if you plan to shoot a lot of action pictures, this may be a consideration.Overall, I would definately recommend this camera.

The LCD is .2 to .3 of an inch smaller than other competitors. Can you really tell the difference? WHY did you buy a digicam??? SO you can take your pictures and put them on the computer to look at.

It has served me well through the years, and while it still works I am now in the market for something smaller & newer and am having trouble finding something that I think will live up to its standards.One of my best friends liked this camera so much she bought a newer almost identical looking version of a Canon in 05, unfortunatly her lens shutter was broken by her kids a few months ago, but she too really liked the camera and will be inheriting mine if I ever can replace it!Pros:I love the flip out screen, this is not a feature you can find often on newer cameras, probably bc it requires a larger camera size.  Its really handy if you are someone like myself who doesnt like to ask strangers @ Disney World to take my picture.It runs on AA batteries!  New cameras seem to only run on the rechargeable lithium ion batteries (again to make the camera more compact), which normally I would prefer, but I am about to go to Europe for a month and I hear that finding a reliable power converter is difficult, so most likely I will have to take the Canon with me there.It has a viewfinder!! I hate that new digital cameras that arent SLRs dont have a viewfinder!  I may not be a photographer, but I dont wanna just use the screen either!Easy to use, although there are a LOT of features on it which I have never even tried to mess with.Cons:Battery life.  This I think is due to the age of the camera, bc I dont recall having such issue with it in the past as I do recently.Start up time.  It always seemed a little slow to start in picture viewing mode but now the camera is older it also is slow in picture taking mode & to view pictures takes almost a minute.Size, but for the time period when it was made, it was considered small then.It uses Compact Flash cards not SD.

If you do this, your pictures will look as lifelike as possible.The only drawback about the camera for me is the small maximum aperature size.

This is my first digital, which I researched before buying.  I used to own a Minolta film SLR, which was also a nice camera.  But, this Canon for \"normal\" prints (5x7 or so) is about as good as that Minolta was.  And because it's digital, I'm saving $$ over a film camera.I expect this to be my \"bread and butter\" camera.  The everyday, pictures of the nephew and niece camera.  When I can afford it, I'll get a digital rebel.Also when I can afford it, I'll get a Canon printer.  Maybe two: one for the desktop, and a second portable one.  Seems to me that a portable printer with this camera is about as close to a Polaroid as the digital world has to offer.It will take you some practice to learn how to hold the camera steady.  Two tricks I've discovered.  1 - buy a little tripod.  For about $10 you can get an 8\" or so tripod which is great for estting the camera up on a table or car or whatever.  2 - use the 2 second delay so that pressing the button does not interfere with the shutter's movement.  I'm not at all sure this \"problem\" is unique to this camera, I suspect it's true with most digital point-and-shoots.This camera is not very big, in fact it's smaller than many film point and shoot cameras I've seen, but I've found that some people prefer something smaller.

A couple of things: I haven't tried it with lenses yet. A friend has the A70 and has used a macro lense on it; she didn't think it worked as well as it should... I don't know if Canon A80 will have similar issues, but the macro shots on the A80 without lenses are good enough I don't think I care! Plus, even the capability of using additional lenses on a camera this size and price blows me away. The flip-out screen is Worth It. Yes, that cute little addition is actually worthwhile. Go for it. The automatic setting on this is great -- I haven't improved on it (but will try the P setting adjustment mentioned in another review - thankyou!), but the landscape, portrait, and different color settings are great additions. I've only had this camera 9 months, but I have already learned a ton about photography, and this camera challenges me to keep improving! It has plenty of room to grow on!

I knew there had to be a catch, so I did my research and checked up on reviews by both customers and professionals. I wanted something easy to use, but not something cheap that would only last me a few months. My studies showed that there was no catch, this camera had the features I've been looking for but could not afford. This was definitely the right choice for me.The 4.0 megapixel A80 is the perfect camera for a beginner who does not want to look like one. In addition to its sleek style, it's easy to use (point and shoot) but also has features that I yet have to learn. I'm very impressed with the quality of the photos as they came out bright, sharp and vivid. I don't understand the complaints about the battery life (from many reviews) as I've taken over 100 photos during my vacation and I'm still on my first batch of batteries (love the AA batteries!). Just be sure to turn off your camera when it's not in use. I also enjoy the tilting/swivel LCD screen which allows you to shoot from different angles. All my friends seem to envy that feature in particular. It's also small enough to carry around but not too small that it would be easy to lose/misplace. It also has a movie mode with sound, but I haven't tried that yet.The only cons I have with the camera (but I can live with) is that the monitor seems too small and it's hard to see images in daylight. I wish it had more zoom as well. The CF door seems very fragile and each time I open it, I feel like it's going to fall off.Other than that, I highly recommend the A80 to those who are new to digital cameras but would like the extra features of a more advanced camera.

I bought this camera after months of research, comparing all sorts of brands from Sony, Kodak, Olympus, etc. So now, I'll address all the features and how this camera stacks up.1) 4MP: Perfect2) One of best in low-light/no flash; I generally don't like the lighting with flash even on professional cameras. I've gotten great dim pictures of animals sleeping with this. Note: Must be steady [See Recommendations]3) CF Flash 1; That's still good & cheap, but not as fast as CF2.4) 4 AA-battery; A number so heavy, but multi-purpose5) It fits my pocket, but it's a bit heavy with the batteries6) Yup, but I think Sony does a better job with auto mode7) Few cameras have manual and I'm still learning with this. Note: Having a manual mode means that there's a fairly steep learning curve, but fortunately there's auto if needed8) I can't tell you how many candid shots I've gotten with the swivel LCD. It's a must!9) Arg. This camera has lag. Maybe 1-2 seconds worth. No camera for this price seems to minimize this. Maybe in a few years?10) Alright, but batteries/CF door a bit flimsy11) 3x optical zoom so that's just fair12) Uses digital motor to zoom, which is slow. Not available on consumer cameras though.13) 320x280 video mode, 3min max is ok, but even the A70 had 640x480 so this is just bad14) Even with the so-called waterproof case, this is just bad. Just avoid moisture or get an el-cheapo camera for water situations (what I did)15) Yup. Land of the Rising Sun. High QC16) Actually improves based on the memory card17) Yup, there are plenty of sites that demonstrate hot to optimize the manual modes18) Probably not in the near future19) Nope.20) Yes, so I can possibly apply a UV filter or whatnotRecommendations:-Tripod-Rechargeable batteries-256+ CF card, 512MB /1 GB recommended (I know a lot of people like the 256 MB card, but once you get into this camera, you can finish off a 256 MB card in one night i.e. 200 pictures + 3/4 video clips)", "Date": "May 18, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R117ZUVQS2V69Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have only had this camera for a few days, but have tried to use as many options as possbile to test it out.

The quality is very good, the only problem is that jpeg compression tends to obscure minute details, and it is missing the RAW/uncompressed images options. That is not much of a problem until you start to do a lot of editing of the photos, and each successive save as a jpeg results in further image degradation.

It's disappointing because there have been times when after having everyone stand there for several pictures, I still don't end up with a good one and have to give up.", "Date": "March 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Defect in construction", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R3811WL15P7KM7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I will not address photographic quality because I believe that it is very good, but I was confronted with a significant, in my opinion, constructional defect.

The only reason I give it fewer stars is because of potential quality issues (yet to be determined). Canon recently changed all production for this model to China. The general perception is that Made in Japan is of much better quality. Regardless as to the truth of the perseption, it is very true that things made in China are made at a much much lower cost to thing made in Japan. So far my camera has functioned well, however only time will tell. I feel cheated since all my research (online, in stores, etc) was based on the Made in Japan version. People will tell you they are identical, however that is usually not the case. Even if the parts are the same the quality control usually differs.I feel cheated by Canon and retailers by this change.

The underwater case has a 7 DAY WARANTY and the camera is not covered for water damage.  My father had a similar problem with his $1000 Nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason, they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500.
