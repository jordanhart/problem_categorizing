{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Granny Loves Her New Point and Shoot", "Author": "Pete \"Collector of films and books that enhan...", "ReviewID": "R1XC1SMEPEWJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For starters, I purchased this camera for my sweet old grandmother who was looking to step into the world of digital cameras. She's always asking for pictures of the family whenever there are get-togethers. For her, this camera has been very easy to use, just point and shoot. She has it set in the iA setting and the shots come out great. She hasn't used the video mode just yet, but I'm teaching her how to switch the settings over to it. I'm overall pleased with this camera and as long as granny is happy, that's all that counts.The zoom is only 4x but for the purpose that I bought it for, it's enough. Great to put in your pocket or purse and take it out quickly when you need it. It's fairly light, not heavy at all. The rechargeable battery it comes with is another plus. As long as you know you're purchasing this without the expectations of those more expensive cameras with 10 to 35x zooms on them, you can't go wrong with this everywhere, everyday kind of camera from Panasonic. Also, getting a small carrying case for it is highly recommended like this one here from Case Logic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black) Don't forget the SD Card too.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Reasonable price, good gift", "Author": "DAG", "ReviewID": "R733OU080CFII", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it as a gift and it was a pretty good hit. The digital \"Intelligent Zoom\" gets you to 8x zoom. There is a quick auto-focus and an \"Intelligent Auto\" setting where the camera can choose the optimal settings. Also equipped with a panoramic setting to get wide or tall shots. Not really a camera to get and use for all your prized photos, but it's a good gift with some bells and whistles.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "I can't believe the quality", "Author": "R.

I have previously owned a 5Mb camera which created much clearer photos.  I wish to return this camera, probably just a lemon.Followup:  I did return the first camera which Amazon did with speedy exchange at no cost including free shipping, but the second camera is still disappointing with the clarity of the photos. I was using the automatic focusing feature which is supposed to make things simple for a camera dork like me. Went directly via phone to the manufacturer and after about a half hour with trying several attempts of a fix, nothing seemed to solve the problem.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix S2 14.1MP", "Author": "GK in QH", "ReviewID": "R2W8AL0HTKU9YJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's a lot to like about this camera.
