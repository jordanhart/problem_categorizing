The cameras are large 245x82x165mm (includes bracket). Although my cameras are rated for outdoor use I wanted to provide extra protection against vandalism.The enclosures are light weight aluminum (not cast or steel). This enclosure works well for my application. My cameras are mounted 15ft-20ft off the ground. I installed my bullet cameras by disassembling the mounting bracket of the camera and leaving the entire assembly inside the enclosure. I secured the camera to the mounting plate of the enclosure. The mounting plate snaps out for easy access. This enclosure has an abundance of working space.In order for my IR (night vision) to work properly, I had to remove the front glass window of the enclosure. Be very careful when removing the glass window, it will splinter. Note: Cameras with IR (night vision) will reflect back at the camera lens if the protective window of the enclosure is not removed. This essentially disables your cameras ability to operate properly at night. Also, if your application is outdoor, use an outdoor rated camera when using this enclosure.I hope you find this information useful.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera Mounting Device", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R1N42KOKF8OUWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have used these before.  always get them thru amazon.

The size and construction are professional and the mount is solid (all metal). I'm not seeing any glare issues with the plexiglass (no IR in use).Pros:- Quality materials and construction- Professional/intimidating appearance (not cheesy or fake looking)- Well-sealed against moisture- Easy access to internals for installing and servicing the camera- Retail boxCons:- Cable access is too small for USB-A female plug- Does not include mounting bolts (supply your own)- No instructions included (not that they're really needed)I just placed an order for another one.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vitek VT-EH10 Indoor/Outdoor Camera Enclosure", "Author": "JY", "ReviewID": "ROB4N9EWEZDR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This enclosure is built to last. It's huge though. I put a tiny IP camera in it and I really don't need all that space.One thing I did not like is that the pass-through hole for the cable is not big enough to accommodate an RJ45 cable. That's not very convenient for PoE IP cameras. However, it is plastic, so it's not difficult to make that hole slightly bigger.All in all, a good product that's a little overkill for my application.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good construction.

Well these thieves would run up with a ladder and pull the cameras and be gone. After installing the cams in the housing, they don't bother messing with em. It's quite the bonus.

Works great.", "Author": "Brad L. Carelli", "ReviewID": "R2GNT74TU8DGTN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera inclosure is heavy duty and pretty much water proof.  It has a place for a pad lock so that the camera inclosure can only be opened by an authorized person.  It has a glass in the front.  This will be a problem if your cameras have night vision.  The night vision reflects in the glass causing a glare.  The glass can be removed easily to alleviate this problem.  Over all this is a great product if you are looking for a sturdy and secure inclosure for a security camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good price", "Author": "MarkyMark", "ReviewID": "R3HPJ4MTF1DRNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good price.

I put Q-see cameras inside them, which were fairly easy to mount on the internal rail. They haven't had any problems in any weather conditions so far. The only issue I've had is getting the power and coax video cords through the little grommet in the bottom. It was a tight fit, but I was eventually able to force them through. I'm not sure how well something like an RJ-45 cable would fit through there, although you could just thread the cable through and crimp an end onto it afterwards.The mount itself is nice looking and very sturdy. It looks much more imposing than the actual camera inside does.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Housing for Security Camera", "Author": "Mark A. avery", "ReviewID": "RZVTFVN2OAG3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent quality, quick shipping. My camera(s) have night vision, so they cast a dim light forward.
