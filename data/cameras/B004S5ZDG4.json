{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great alternative to traditional d-SLRs, with the most versatile superzoom for Alpha series cameras", "Author": "D. F. Watt \"dfwatt\"", "ReviewID": "R1XHG47J7D1UIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending endless time reviewing articles and talking with several camera and photography professionals, I took the plunge, and finally moved up from a point and shoot super zoom (a small Nikon), with the generous aid of my lovely wife as a birthday present.  It has been truly a revelation, in terms of both video and photo quality. Like everything else, it's all about tradeoffs. The larger APS-C sensor (in most digital SLRS and larger format ILC like the Sony NEX series) means a bigger body, more weight, larger lenses, and of course more money for all that glass, but also means much better low light performance, higher detail, and faster performance.  The difference in low light is really huge, where a point and shoot struggles to produce a decent 4x6 print, while an APS-C camera can produce a decent 8x10 at ISO 1600.  I initially struggled with the question of what lens to get with the camera - the standard kit lens and a modest telephone (75-200) or a superzoom lens like the 18-250.  I am glad I chose the latter, as it has been a great plus to not have to change lenses.  The lens is reasonably sharp, not as sharp as a prime lens (or the new Sony 16-50mm 2.8), but not bad especially if stopped down a bit (at least to f5.6 if not f8 - lens is sharpest at ~f8).  The lens however is heavier by a lot compared with the standard kit lens (which is not a bad lens by any means and offers a cheaper alternative), but then again, it does a lot more.  See testing of this lens and the standard kit lens at imaging resource if you want the technical details.What Sony has done with their APS-C sensor (and by the way they make the sensor that Nikon uses in the 5100 and several other Nikon SLRs) is nothing short of brilliant. First of all, the idea of a translucent mirror that doesn't have to move, and that therefore provides constant live view and constant phase detection autofocus in movie mode (and also provides 10 frames per second high speed shooting to boot) was a stroke of genius - you do have give up the through the lens view (but get a bright electronic viewfinder that is bigger and brighter than all but the very best SLR prisms and is 'through the lens' too but derived from the sensor).The whole design is well executed, rich with useful (as opposed to gimmicky) features, and provides a rich operating system for those upgrading from small digital cameras, while offering most of the traditional virtues of SLRs. Software provided by Sony is also quite good, offering many useful editing and other features. The panorama and high dynamic range modes are a revelation to work with.Bottom Line -- you get better movie ability and the same photo capability of most of the best mid-range dSLRs, and with a richer feature set and full time autofocus both for liveview photo and movie work.Pros:1) Has won numerous awards (a rare Gold Award from Digital Photography Review, 2010 Camera of the Year from Popular Photography, rave review from Imaging Resources) due to its great feature set, performance, and value for the money2) Great movie capability (excepting one major and one minor issue)3) Great photo capability with many useful modes and special features (including a super panorama mode and a 10 fps high speed mode)4) Easy to use for someone with modest technical ability - just put in AUTO or AUTO+ modes and start shooting.5) Flexible and powerful for someone with more technical ability willing to master the multiple modes and functions6) Best LCD panel in the price range, fully articulated7) Sony's lenses are relatively cheap and fairly light weight with decent optics and performance (compared with Canon & Nikon)8) Good (and fast) autofocus - rarely misses a shot9) Neatest feature (among many) - automatic activation of electronic viewfinder and deactivation of LCD by proximity to the eyepiece -- EVF turns on as you get near it)10) Wide zoom range from 18-250 means that one lens covers almost everything from moderate wide angle to moderate telephotoCons:1) When using IS (image stabilization) in movie mode, camera sensor heats up quickly, limiting movie length to a few minutes (29 minutes max without IS) - temperature dependent2) Modest battery life, esp. if you use the great LCD a lot (can be turned off)3) Limited control in movie mode, and only two file formats (AVCHD AND MP4) and three file resolutions4) Limited playback options for movie files from within the camera - start, stop and pause, no slow motion.5) Mild tendency towards overexposure in bright conditions (easily corrected) (NOTE: improved in 2.0 firmware update)6) Movies can get lens noise introduced, requiring external mic for best sound7) Big lens to lug around, and as always, all that glass ain't free.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lasted only 13 months....", "Author": "Josie Wales", "ReviewID": "R18KIH1GPDG1DU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Loved this camera at first.

I usually shop Amazon and so am placing my review of the camera here. I am getting ready for a trip and wanted to upgrade my D80 so I can shoot HD video without lugging a separate video camera around. I am mainly a stills photographer, but enjoy shooting video and creating mixed stills/video travel presentations. The a55 might have less battery life than other similar cameras. If this is due to the GPS and image stabilization, these can be turned off. The a55 is touted as having \"fastest AF in live view\" by dpreview and others due to its \"translucent mirror\" technology. This is misleading. It certainly has the \"smoothest\" focusing, but it is not lightning. In one test I switch focus on a subject at 6 feet to one at 30 feet with a shallow depth of field. It took the a55 about 2-3 secs. to focus. The focus was nice and smooth with no \"hunting\". For small focus changes it kept up nicely. Other DSLRs tend to \"hunt\" for the subject which creates a distracting \"in and out\" of focus pattern. The a55 auto focus is noisy and easily picked up on the build in mic. An external mic would be needed  for decent sound capture if using auto focus. The main problem I had with shooting video with this camera is the length of clip size is limited due to the camera getting hot. With image stabilization in the highest resolution, the camera shut off after a 7 minute clip.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony A55VHZ Small Grip", "Author": "S. Lee", "ReviewID": "R2UDD48BQ9HSYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera and the SAL18250 lens are excellent.  Pictures come out beautiful. The zoom range of the lens is excellent. However, due to its small camera body and the weight of the lens it is difficult to hold the camera using right hand only.  The center of gravity tries to tilt the camera forward (especially with the lens extended out) and the grip area is smaller than the old Sony A200. But it is OK to hold it with both hand. Overall it is a good camera lens combination for an all around camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thank you, beginner camera", "Author": "anitim", "ReviewID": "R2QBORY8FYK0IK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was my first serious camera, I only owned Sony bridge DSC-H2 before. Had a55 for a year, it taught me so much that the leather on it start show use. I sent it to repair twice during this period for the same reason: USB connection stopped working, computer could not see the camera. Other then that no issues. My camera was noisy, got overhitted soon when shooting video, but it was fast, light and easy to learn. Sold it on Amazon to buy a77 because needed more durable weather sealed camera with better image quality, but will always be grateful to small battery eater a55.

What I wanted was a camera with HD video (EOS 450 doesn't even have video feature), at least 16 mp resolution, fast burst, swirl screen, and good photo quality for sure. First of cause I was still looking at Canon lines of DSLR cameras, such as EOS 60D. Although I am an avid user of all sorts of digital cameras (I have about 6 or 7 point-and-shoot or SLR DCs), I don't really like going out with a heavy and bulky camera bag so actually my most used cameras are long room all-in-one cameras, which are my Sony DSC-HX5V and Canon PS S3. I am not willing to go all the way to Canon EOS 7D or 5D Mark since I don't think I need those professional level machines and those are heavy.I've used Canon for long time and mostly they are of good photo quality, but with a SLR camera, lenses are more important, and Canon's low end kit lenses (the ones I have with my EOS 450) are not that great, photos with these lenses are clean, but colors are dull, and not very sharp. If I have to spend a lot of money on lenses, it starts to get expensive. So after study all the mid-low end DSLR, I think Sony A55 provides the best of all, especially with some nice features such as HDR and bracketing (my Sony DSC-HX5V has bracketing but not HDR), and of cause the sweeping panorama, and fast burst speed, plus it is light weight. I also like GPS, it's cool to be able to record such information on the photos when you travel sometimes.Tired of changing lenses during photo shooting, I elect to have 18-250 kit lens, and this Amazon package with this lens and an extra battery, a 32GB C10 SD card and some other stuff was only $1050, very good deal. But again I got this a little late since right after I received the package Sony announced the new A57 model coming out. Well, just have to forget about it.After using the Sony A55 for about a month and took more than 1000 pictures, I would like to give some thoughts:Pros:Very good photo quality as entry level DSLR with kit lens. Much better lens than Canon's entry level products; Photos are sharp and colors are vivid. GPS is very fast to detect satellites, much faster than my Sony DSC HX5V; I read pro's comments about this camera tends to over expose a little so I set exposure -0.3 lower, it comes out with great results. I really like the bracketing feature since it can take 3 photos rapidly with different exposure, and you can choose later on which one you want to keep. Believe me, with different conditions, sometimes you want a photo to over expose a little and sometimes under expose a little, with this feature you don't need to adjust it and take a photo twice to achieve this goal. The HDR really gives some nice details and tame the contrast when you need. Video is really great. Comparing the photos with the ones taken with Sony DSC HX5V, you know why you do need to have a DSLR camera sometimes.Cons:The body size. A55 tries to make itself a mini SLR, but the height is bit too small, holding it and moving fingers around doesn't feel as comfortable as on the Canon 450D. That's why the new A57 has bulked up to A65's size; the sweeping panorama on A55 does not seem to be as good as on the HX5V, you hear ka-ka-ka continuous shooting sound, while on HX5V it's quiet. Also on HX5V you get 180 degree while A55 does not get that much; Also I would suggest Sony to consider adopting Canon's side open swirl screen.Overall I like this camera very much and have happily given away my Canon 450 set to a family member as a gift.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera and very good zoom lens in kit", "Author": "Online-K\u00e4ufer", "ReviewID": "RQS13BTW0FG16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing camera with a great performance and a multitude of features.
