Zimmerman", "ReviewID": "R1B27MZ2A5I425", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you want to buy a cheap, easy to use, light camera, this is for you.  If you want a good camera, well, don't use Kodak.Audio quality - Not the greatest for the videos.  The sounds blend together and you can hardly hear at all.  It also makes background noises sound WAY louder.Affordable - Wonderful price!!!!!!  But I can see why...  You really DO get what you pay for.Accuracy of description - Kodak makes this camera appear professional, so don't judge it by the box.Auto focus - It is so-so for pictures, but the video auto focus is terrible.Battery life - Average.Brightness - A little TOO bright.Battery recharge speed - Not too long of a recharge period.Built to last - NO.  It started getting chipped within the first year.  And if you drop it, there WILL be a mark.Compactness - Pretty good.Color quality - All right...Display - Things looked so much better BEFORE I took the picture.Durable - Yes, but not the best.Display quality - Not good AT ALL.Ease of use - Super easy to figure out.Easy to carry - Well, it fits in my pocket, doesn't it?Extra features - TONS of these!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Grip - If you're sweaty, it slides out of your hands, but it's okay.Glare - I tried taking pictures at the beach, but all of them came out grainy and blurry because I couldn't see what I was doing.Good for kids - Face it: kids don't care about features and picture quality, they just want a camera they can use.  If that's what they want, that's what they've got, withOUT all of the toppings and extras.Good sound - NAH!HD video - NOPE.Night vision - Pictures turn out the same as if you had taken them in the daytime...  That doesn't mean they're GOOD, though.Responsiveness - Yup.Style - I like it.Thickness - Not BAD.Usability - Totally.Video quality - Horrible!!!  Blurry and out of focus.Zoom - It SAYS 10 megapixels, but I've had tons of trouble zooming in on stuff.  And it's grainy, too, once you DO figure out how to zoom in.All-in-all, it's a sucky camera.  I'm looking into getting a Nikon or Canon or Sony.  This camera was so bad, that when I left it at my friend's house two months ago, I barely felt like getting it back.  So I don't have a camera at all.  Hey, no camera is BETTER than a Kodak.  :P", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002VL7J3M"}}
