Had the Pentax K 30 for two weeks before taking on vacation as it was user friendly with capacity of a more professional quality for a amateur like me. Was very pleased with the pictures and found them to be very true to original colors. Looking forward to taking a photography class to learn proper technique for picture taking. Would highly recommend.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good seller", "Author": "mckinzee \"mckinzee\"", "ReviewID": "R2RO82XLURTP8J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The owner manual and quick start guide was missing from the box when we got it.Not sure how that happened?The Seller wanted me to download the owners manual \"on line\".After a few days of communications - they did send me an owners manual - but not the quick start guide.I did contact Pentax and they sent me a quick start guide.Rather disappointing for my first DSL.I'm not too impressed with the camera.But that's probably because I'm still getting used to it and it's my first DSL.The price was good.I finally figured out how to get good pictures in a low light setting.But it is VERY heavy compared to my point and shoot cameras and I can't imagine carrying it on a vacation or hiking.I do like that it has hardly any lag time and I can take several \"action\" pictures in a row.My black dogs often come out purple and my Canon point and shoot has better color.It is probably operator error as this is my first DSL.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "missing quick manual and moldy clean kit", "Author": "Diana", "ReviewID": "RNYUWUG1NPU38", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the box was not well padded - resulting the ruptured packaging for the cleaning kit and resulting in mold.#2  The fast use guide for the camera as identified in the manual is missing.
