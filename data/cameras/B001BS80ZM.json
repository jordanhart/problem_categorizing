This camera was consistently rated highly. So were most of the Canon cameras, which are rated even higher.However, if you look carefully at the reviews (especially Consumer Reports), you will see that the overall rating is heavily influenced by things such as ease of operation, features, etc. Yet, they mostly say this Samsung had the single advantage of superior picture quality.I decided to forgo the other aspects of the reviews and get maximum picture quality. To me, the reason to use a camera is to get a good picture. I am not disappointed. I am not a camera buff and find this camera easy to use with more features than I'll ever use on a regular basis. Oh; and the picture quality is truly excellent - just what a camera should do.", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent all-purpose camera", "Author": "M. Levy", "ReviewID": "R3HT8P9YQ5WAAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera combined the advantages of excellent pictures, lots of features and low price in a pocket-size package.  The 28 mm equivalent zoom lens offers a wider than normal range for such small cameras.  Small videos were easy to take for web applicatons like You-Tube.Included software did a good job for picture editing, but video editing capability was minimal.  The only weakness I encountered was low sound level during video recording (required being very close to the person speaking).  On the other hand, my SLR doesn't offer any video recording.Picture quality has been similar to my SLR in most situations, but I will use the smaller camera more often since it is easier to carry.The bottom line:  I would definitely buy this camera again.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "W.

The pictures are of great quality and won't miss any details.  For many weeks, I was shopping for a more than a good camera, comparing all different brands and prices and I'm glad I was able to find this Samsung for such a great price $137.43... This camera takes great quality pictures compared to the best brands (sony, kodak, etc.) Samsung products are really good and have become my favorite brand, specially because I don't need to spend a lot of money to get great quality products.

It caught my eye earlier when it was the only subcompact camera Consumer Reports gave and Excellent rating for image quality. This camera takes GREAT pictures and the 13.6 megapixels allows you to zoom in on a photo 4 to 5 times before it shows any signs of pixelation. Stunning quality on large prints. The 'children' setting works well for moving shots but Duel Image Stablization setting has a long shutter time. It works well in low light but you do have to hold the camera very still. The flash is deceptively bright and room filling and the red-eye feature works well. Battery life seems good and recharging is easy via USB or AC Power.The negatives are poor video quality. I got the best results at 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second but it's not much better than  cell phone quality. If you zoom while videoing, the sound cuts out. I don't know why, just weird! Poor lighting and movement don't work to well with this camera(but using the 'children' setting with a flash helped conciderably).This is a Great Little Pocket Camera for photos.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Richard W.

Foss", "ReviewID": "R3ODCZ0WWW3QPG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good camera for the price. By now it has been replaced by other models. I see it as overall an indicator of good quality delivered by Samsung, compared to some other manufacturers. This is also based on my experience with Samsung cell phones, which I find pretty good. Picture quality is great, as long as there is plenty of light. In low light this camera suffers, though the flash works well. It is also pretty slow to take shots, more so in low light, so I get poor results trying to capture anything moving. In low light there can be a delay of 3 seconds between when you press the button and when the shutter clicks. It does not turn on and take pictures in your pocket like some I have owned. I have shot some primitive videos with it: resolution is poor. Sound is poor with the tiny microphone, and if in a very quiet environment, the recording will include the noise of the camera itself, probably the auto-focus running. It will serve for basic video memories, if you have nothing better. I find the build quality pretty good, it seems to stand up to some abuse. There are some bad reviews on here, of owners who have had it die early on. I consider that just a normal part of gadgets: even the best gadgets are going to have a percentage of failure.

Bacon", "ReviewID": "R12CDDRLGFWRSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera with a great price. The photos turn out really nice, the 13.1MP are used well and not wasted, like some larger MP cameras. This camera is sleek and easy to use. The buttons are all similar to other digital cameras and recognizable for their functions. The screen is a decent size and very clear. This camera has a good range of 'extra features'. The zoom has a good digital and physical range, there is a wide angle lens, a video setting and a rechargeable battery. The camera comes with a USB charger, which can charge from the wall or your computer. The USB interface also allows for easy access to your files. There is an AV cable for showing your photos on TV, where they look pretty good. There is of course a slot for an SD card.Since getting this camera, I've been pretty impressed with all of it's features.

Easy to use too.  Worked well in March.  In April the temperatures hit 80 degrees and the camera refused to cooperate.  When powered on the lens would scroll out and then right back in.  Sent it in for repairs four times.  Each time they cleaned it, found nothing wrong with it and returned it.  It never worked any time that it was returned.  After the fourth trip for service and it still did not work I demanded my money back.  I was told that the warranty was for repair only and not refund, but that I could get an exchange.  I was asked to forward my receipt and I would be contacted within 48 hours.  I immediately emailed the receipt out and did not hear back from anyone. A week later I tried to call but the recording told me to leave my phone number and somebody would call me back.  I did and still no response.  I emailed twice and still no response.

Amazon's vendor of this camera, forget the name, called and asked if they could just replace it.
