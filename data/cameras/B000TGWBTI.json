{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SAMSUNG is the New Sony!!", "Author": "J. Hardjojuwono \"JJ\"", "ReviewID": "R39FWXFY59OHG0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you read my previous digicam review, you'll know that I am no stranger to consumer digicam. This Samsung L730 is my eleventh digicam, and I am very happy with it due to these 4 factors:1) Price is very reasonable (I bought it for only US$156.5 in Nov 07)2) Video quality is very, very good (it does MP4 video, slow and steady hand required).3) Nightshot/low-light shot are good.4) It has a manual option. Not full blown manual, but enough for prosumer.Overall built is good, but of medium quality. Design wise is similar to other cameras in the higher price range plus some added improvements (sound & light notification, I thinks it's neat and thoughtful). The USB charge cable is also nicely designed, where it has charging light built into the Samsung propietary connector. Although, battery door is a little flimsy. If you decide to carry the digicam in its purse, you need to pull it out by the lanyard when you want to take it out, otherwise you will unlatch the batt-door when you grab it by the top and bottom sides.Another negative point that a would be buyer should be aware of, is the action time to turn on and to shoot are, in my opinion, noticeably slower than other digicams that I've used.Other than that, everything else is perfect. I would highly recommend this camera for:1) People who appreciate value for the money.2) People looking for high quality video camera (I chose this over Sanyo Xacti due to the fact that L730 does MP4 video in 800*600 pixel resolution in 20 fps. I don't see other affordable CCD-based digicam who can do this at the time of the writing).P.S. Battery life has not been checked, since I just got this camera 3 days ago.I used to be a fan of SONY products until they steadily increase their consumer products prices. IMHO: SAMSUNG is the New Sony in term of product quality and design (but with more reasonable prices).", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT LITTLE CAMERA", "Author": "RLL \"Rafael\"", "ReviewID": "R17ZBEFFVC7L4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must say one thing about this camera; it's great. At first I felt  disappointed. The camera felt too flimsy. I guest I am accustom to old heavy cluker cameras, but man was I fool. This little guy does a great job with pictures and not to mention videos.It will knock your socks off wend you see the video quality this thing can do. If you are looking for a good small quality camera I think this little guy can do the job, and for the price you cant go wrong.", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE CAMARA", "Author": "Miguel A.

The image quality is decent in normal shooting conditions. The worst part is the waiting time between shoots when using flash. It takes around 4-6 seconds to take another shoot and the red eye mode takes even more.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000TGWBTI"}}
