{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost Perfect 4.9 stars!", "Author": "K. Wheaton \"valleygardener\"", "ReviewID": "R1FS9ZHZIOETZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using this camera for a few weeks I am amending my rating and giving it 5 stars. This camera is truly incredible. The intelligent automatic is amazing---I only move it to manual for a few special situations. The only real complaint is that I occasionally inadvertently hit the video button. Otherwise it is simply amazing.It handles difficult situations with grace. Sunset with sky and foreground properly exposed. Delivery room newborn with no flash and low ambient lighting. Black and white is fantastic. Couldn't be happier.This is a great camera for a beginner---Point and shoot. Lots of control for advance photographers. I'm sorry to say I don't lug around a camera bag and tripod anymore. Just slip this in my purse.I waited a long time to upgrade from the first generation Panasonic Lumix TZ1 (complete with dangling lens cover & 5MP) Glad I did. The best improvements are the quick power-up and lack of a shutter delay for catching fast action. If you leave it in the completely automatic mode it does an impressive job---and if you need control there's plenty and then some. Lots of programs plus aperture and shutter priority or complete control.Other notable improvements are in the macro end of things where capturing very fine close-ups are greatly improved---my TZ1 was always focusing on the background if I could get it to focus at all. This does an incredible job! Almost too much detail (if that's possible) Every speck on the petal of a flower is exposed. This camera is slightly smaller and has a larger display screen. Most of the functions and dials are similar and I find easy to use but that may be because they are familiar.Flash is improved over the first generation.The zoom on the original was 10X. 12X even better. I took incredible photos of bullfrogs 15 feet away. Unbelievable detail.This camera isn't perfect and no camera will ever be. It would be nice to have a more powerful flash and nice if you could shoot in lower light with less noise without flash and it would be nice if it had a 20X optical zoom and a faster lens but for what it is its an incredible piece of engineering. AND don't forget the Leica lens which is just plain beautiful.All cameras have limitations and this is no exception. However it will get you a great photo most of the time. The wide angle to long telephoto range is why I bought my first Lumix. This flexibility makes for great travel photos. I did side by side comparisons of a Sony, Canon, Nikon and the first Lumix in the store and then we printed them out on the spot. No comparison. No ghosting, better color correction, better macro. And I like the ergonomics. I always place the wrist band over my wrist and hold onto the camera with fingers and pad of thumb and it feels secure. Some of the ultra small cameras are almost too small for me. (Didn't compare to current models)What is truly awful about this camera is that the manual is on a disk and covers this camera and its 2 predecessors making it a bit (if Not totally confusing at times). It also does not come with MAC compatible editing software which is really not a big deal for me. One person asked if it is MAC OSX 10.6.3 compatible and it is. The only problem I've encountered is in using Aperture (a MAC program)it doesn't want to import directly into a project that has other images from my other Lumix camera. Make a new project and problem is solved but irritating. (Manual software and downloading from card to MAC is compatible)Haven't tried uploading video yet.DO purchase an extra Panasonic Battery DMW-BCG 10PP. Make sure it has the PP (It won't work without it) Also you'll need a SD Card. It's not necessary to go to the Class 6 cards unless you are shooting HD video. A SDHC 4GB card will hold 700+ photos at full MP.For most people this will be more than adequate. I carry two cards in case one goes south. You can always find them on sale for under $20. I also like the Caselogic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case for under $8.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good Photos with Great Video", "Author": "Photo-Am \"Vlad\"", "ReviewID": "R2S0R62C4A15MR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've got my ZS7 today - the camera is just great! A superior Leica lens with a high-resolution sensor, advanced image processing, and plenty of sophisticated features in a small but very solid and stylish body.PROS:- Solid metal body, stylish design, nice dark-blue color- Very convenient one-hand grip, unusual for such a small pocket-size body- Short startup time (1-1.5 sec), no shutter lag, fast auto focus- A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording- Big 3\" colorful \"juicy\" display visible even in direct sunlight- Intuitive menu plus very convenient Quick-menu with a dedicated button- Excellent quality Leica lens: sharp and contrast in the entire zoom range- Wide 25mm (35mm equiv.) is very convenient for indoors- Huge 12x optical zoom (up to 300mm equiv.) in such a compact design- Two-speed of zooming - fast/slow controlled by the lever- Smooth and silent auto focus and optical image stabilization- Best in the industry \"iAuto\" mode - you can really trust it!- New \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature greatly improves the image quality- Creative Aperture- and Shutter-priority and full Manual modes- Three independent scenery modes including \"High Dynamic\" range scene- New GPS feature for those who travel a lot- Very good movie quality in 720p AVCHD mode looks like a full 1080 HD one- High-quality stereo microphones- Accepts SD/SDHC and new SDXC huge capacity memory cardsCONS:- A mechanical lever for switching between shooting and playback modes- Some soft \"sh-sh-sh\" noise while zooming in and out (but no \"clicks\")- I wish more sensitivity for low-light shootingBUILD: The ZS7 camera looks and feels as good as it's predecessor DMC-ZS3. The design is almost as the same, just the power switch and the mode dial exchanged their places. One significant addition - a GPS mark on the top, right above the lens. The blue color is not that dark as on TZ5 and not so striking bright as on ZR1. A slight dent on the back with some prominence on the right side makes a very convenient grip to operate with one hand. A metal body looks pretty solid, however it is not that heavy.PERFORMANCE: The new camera has a pretty good performance: the startup time is a little bit more than 1 sec and with almost zero shutter lag. Taking into account a new very quick \"Sonic Speed\" auto focus, which takes about 0.35-0.4 sec, you will be able to catch virtually every spur-of-the-moment photo. And a dedicated movie button allows starting video recording at any time without any preparation.LENS: Leica lens is just excellent: unusually big for a so small body 12x zoom starting with the very convenient for indoors shooting 25mm up to telephoto 300mm (equiv.) plus a quick and precise auto focus (however might be somewhat slower in low-light), and good optical image stabilization in conjunction with the digital one which allows you to take sharp pictures in the entire zoom range and at the very low shutter speed around 1/8 and even 1/4. The auto-focusing and optical image stabilization work in absolute silence, and the only zooming produces some soft \"sh-sh-sh\" noise. Good news - without any start/stop clicks on the footage :).DISPLAY: A large 3-inch high-resolution LCD monitor with 460K pixels has a very good contrast and saturation - the pictures look very \"juicy\". The brightness also is high enough to be seen even in a direct sun-light (just a bit darker) and in a wide angle of view. All that allows to share photos and videos immediately with other people.MENU: For those who used the Panasonic P&S; cameras before the ZS7 menu looks very familiar, just some new items added. Also there is a Quick-Menu button which is very helpful for a quick access to the most frequently used settings. The new camera has such a luxury as the Aperture, Shutter speed, and Manual modes and there is a new Exposure button (next to the video one) which allows to set manually the aperture using the Left-Right buttons and the shutter speed with Up-Down buttons.AUTO SETTINGS: The best in the industry Panasonic's Intelligent Auto mode is getting better with each new model. Actually it's a whole bunch of sophisticated algorithms which help to take really nice pictures with minimum efforts. They are worth to be aware about so here is a brief list of most effective of them.\"Intelligent Scene Selector\" - It quickly analyzes the light conditions as well as focusing results and selects either portrait, scenery, macro, night portrait or night scenery. It also displays a small icon of the chosen scene in the top left corner. The feature is extremely helpful when you need to shoot very fast on spur-of-the-moment.\"Intelligent ISO\" - If camera detects that your subject is moving, it raises ISO and shutter speed to take shots without motion blur, otherwise it will try to keep the lowest possible ISO to reduce noise and to get nice clear pictures.\"Intelligent Exposure\" - it's a kind of a small brother of the High Dynamic Range feature. If the camera sets the correct overall exposure but some areas happen to be too dark, this feature automatically increases the brightness of the dark areas to make the entire picture to look more balanced. It also pretty effective for the backlight conditions - instead of getting just a silhouette of your subject against the bright sky it makes the subject normally exposed but without washing out the nice blue sky.\"Face Detection\" - is another great thing for taking good-quality pictures of people. It happened to me a number of times in the past that a presence in the frame of a more contrast element somewhere behind the person I'm taking picture of was making the camera to adjust focus at that unimportant distant object and therefore made the major person out-of-focus. The same way if there is a bright background behind the person then the camera will measure the luminance of that background while the person's image will be pretty much underexposed (dark). The Face Detection feature identifies the human faces and tells the camera to adjust focus and exposure for the faces first so the people on the picture will be looking well exposed, clear and sharp.ADVANCED FEATURES: I guess the most interesting and advanced is a new \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature. Actually it combines a sophisticated noise reduction with a new picture enhancement algorithm. This feature automatically identifies the 3 type of the picture areas: outlines, detailed textures, and smooth gradation panes and provides an optimized handling for each of them separately. As a result the photo looks sharper at the edges and more clean in between. Many old P&S; cameras had pretty fast picture quality degradation at the ISO around 300-400 and higher. The shots taken by ZS7 even at ISO 400 look pretty good on the small and even medium-size prints.IMAGE QUALITY: Imagine on a sunny day you take an outdoors picture of a wall made of the new brown bricks with a $3000 DSLR and a small P&S; camera from the distance about 6-8 feet. How could you recognize by which camera was taken a certain shot? The subject is plain so no Depth-of-Field is involved into comparison. However in this example the two characteristics will help to distinct the cameras: 1) The edges of bricks will be well outlined on DSLR shots and a kind of fuzzy on the P&S; ones; 2) The new bricks do not have any structure on their sides, they are just plane and so exactly that way they will look on the DSLR shots, while on the P&S; ones their sides will show more or less amount of noise. If you perform the same test for an evenly cut line of bushes (again DOF is not involved) you will see the same result plus the internal structure of each leaf will be more clear on the DSLR photos. So to make pictures taken with your P&S; camera looking like the DSLR ones the P&S; camera should make the outlines sharper, clean the noise on the plane or soft gradation areas, and slightly emphasize the internal structures, if any. That is exactly what the new \"Intelligent Resolution\" (IR) feature tries to do.The \"iAuto\" mode in ZS7 is organized the way that you will have decent, good photos in virtually any situation right out-of-the-box. The several hundreds shots I took by now look good on my 24\" display and so they will on the similar size prints. But if you look at them at 100% crop (magnification) then on many of them you might find some areas which do not look natural. If the IR-algorithm decides about a certain low-contrast part on your picture that it's a plane area then it will remove all the noise altogether with all the subtle details from that part of the picture. If you take a picture of a big tree with hundreds of branches (but without leaves) against a bright sky the IR-feature will treat it as a structured area and will slightly sharpen it to look clearer. But when you take a landscape picture with many distant trees in front and behind, those hundreds of crossing branches will create a low-contrast pattern which together with internal sensor's noise might look for IR-algorithm as just a noisy plain area and so it will obliterate all the details leaving only some average color in that part of the picture and so making it looking very unnatural. The thing is that unlike the previous models the noise reduction in ZS7 is pretty strong. I would not call it \"aggressive\" but it's really strong.QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS: There is a way how to get the best out of this camera while shooting landscapes on sunny days. Here is a recipe for experienced amateurs:  - Switch the mode dial to the program \"P\" mode.  - Press the Menu button and select the lowest ISO 80 instead of \"Auto\" (this is the key-point! If there is no enough light to set that low ISO it will not work).  - Make sure you have the \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature on!  - Find on the 4th page of the shooting menu the item \"PICT.ADJ.\" and press the right button to go inside. You will see the 4 pictures attributes:  CONTRAST  SHARPNESS  SATURATION  NOISE REDUCTION- A default value for each of them is \"0\". Set \"-1\" for contrast (to reduce the clipping of highlights), \"+1\" for sharpness, leave the saturation unchanged, and most important set noise reduction to \"-1\" or even to its minimum \"-2\". Take this advice as a starting point and try to play with the SHARPNESS and NOISE REDUCTION settings and see what looks more appropriate for you, because some people prefer more sharpness while the others are more concern about noise visibility, so try different settings and choose which one looks better for you.Those settings will allow you to take the most sharp and detailed pictures of landscapes, architecture, etc. if you like that. However you should be alert and check periodically the quality of pictures and if something is going wrong then switch immediately to \"iAuto\" mode. The ZS7's intelligent auto-mode is very sophisticated and might take into account the parameters you're not even aware about. For example, if you apply the full zoom then the aperture drops to a small F/4.9 value giving much less light for the sensor and additionally at that huge focal length 300mm (equiv.) the impact of your shaking hands might be as so much that the optical image stabilization can not completely compensate it and so the camera will have to increase the shutter speed to have the picture un-blurred. In that tough scenario the only high ISO around 300-400 might satisfy all those conditions and the camera will normally set it in auto-mode. But if you keep shooting recklessly at ISO 80 without getting the feedback such kind of pictures might be spoiled in some way. So, use this recipe only if you know what you're doing.Update: Having using ZS7 for a while I've identified the 3 major types of pictures depending what is most important for you on those shots: 1) The main part are the areas with soft gradations like human faces, petals of flowers on macro shots, etc; 2) Mixed content of plain areas and patterns with no central subject; 3) Landscapes with plenty of trees, branches and leaves or small flowers. The above proposed recipe is most effective for the last category - it will give you the sharpest pictures with no low-contrast areas smeared by the strong noise reduction and on the other hand the higher level of noise will be effectively hidden by the complex image structure. For the 2nd category it would be wiser to decrease noise reduction just to -1 (not -2) to make the noise less visible on some plain areas, and for the 1st category it seems better to keep the default neutral setting since to have less noise on the human's face is much more important than lack of minor details around. Anyway you'll still have the advantage of less noise at minimum ISO.I did some comparative testing of ZS7 with my Nikon D90 to find out how much that new IR technology and the above mentioned recommendations could help to improve the overall picture quality. I've uploaded some pictures and put a link into my comments dated 04/24/2010 with the title \"Compare to Nikon D90\". Don't assume, just take a look - you might be a bit surprised :-)LOW LIGHT: Recently I performed a brief comparative test of my P&S; cameras: Panasonic ZS7 and Sony TX7. Shortly - their low-light performance (in normal mode) is very similar. The medium-size 8\"x10\" prints without much cropping look good up to ISO 400. At ISO 800 there is a noticeable drop of the image quality of both cameras and at 1600 the shots look decent only for 4\"x6\" prints. Generally the Sony TX7's shots look smoother because of more aggressive noise reduction while the Panasonic ZS7's ones display slightly more details along with a little bit more noise. So it's the matter of taste to decide which shots look better. I would admit that at ISO 1600 while the Panasonic's shots became much more blurred because of the increased noise reduction strength, the Sony's shots became poured with much coarse noise which got even stronger at ISO 3200 making the pictures completely unusable. So neither of these cameras could be considered as great low-light performers.In case when the shots become too dark because of big lack of light you can select the \"HIGH SENS.\" (sensitivity) scene. The camera will automatically choose a high ISO in the range 1600 - 6400 and decrease resolution to 3MP (it was stated 3200-6400 but in some tests my camera set ISO 1600). It will not provide better quality but at least will allow to increase the picture's brightness.NOTE! This camera is great outdoors, but if many of your pictures are indoors or in low-light environment then you'd better look for some other cameras like Panasonic LX5/LX3 or GF1, Canon S95/S90 or G12/G11, Fujifilm F80EXR, etc. which were designed especially for those conditions. The original model name of this camera is \"TZ\" which stands for \"Travel Zoom\" i.e. it was designed for travel outdoors, not for indoors.DYNAMIC RANGE: means the difference between the most light and dark areas on the picture. If you're taking the shots of your friends on a sunny day with a bright blue sky above and some bushes with green leaves aside and those bushes happen to be in the shadow of a nearby building then the difference between brightness of the sky and the bushes will be thousands of times. On the shots taken by a camera with narrow dynamic range only one element - your friends might look good, but the sky will be completely washed out to white and the bushes will be almost black. For the cameras with a decent DR like ZS7 at least two elements of that picture will look good i.e. either your friends with a nice blue sky while the bushes will be very dark, or the friends and bushes good but the sky pretty much wiped out. The new Panasonic ZS7 has the two solutions to help in such situations: the \"Intelligent Exposure\" feature and the \"High Dynamic (range)\" scene.Although both solutions aim at the same goal they work in a different way and should be used in different situations. The \"Intelligent Exposure\" feature once it is activated via the main or quick menu puts its white icon to the lower left corner and starts constantly analyzing the picture. If the difference in brightness of some significant areas of the picture exceeds a certain threshold then the icon becomes yellow and that feature decreases the overall contrast of the picture. Since that threshold is very high that feature would be mostly useful on the bright sunny days. Its effectiveness is not that big but it still can be helpful and anyway it's better than nothing so you can have it turned on all the time. The \"High Dynamic\" scene should be used only in low light conditions because even in a bright sun it will unconditionally set ISO 400 (or even higher) and decrease the shutter speed. Such a high ISO will greatly increase the amount of noise and therefore will cause a more aggressive noise reduction which will actively obliterate small details. That scene provides much more effective dynamic range compression but at the cost of significantly decreased picture quality. If you're shooting in a low-light condition you have nothing to loose, but if you're taking pictures on a nice day with a plenty of sunshine the loss of quality might greatly disappoint you, so that scene should be used only for the low-light shooting.MOVIE MODE: By now I tried only the advanced AVCHD movie mode - it looked very well. Apart from the processing the still images in this model Panasonic applied their new \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature to video recording as well and the result is just gorgeous! Because of that special processing personally its 720p HD looks even better than from my Sony TX7 with its full 1080 HD resolution.So this new Panasonic ZS7 camera is a very good device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Improves on the already great ZS3!", "Author": "Alansky \"Alan S.\"", "ReviewID": "R3DQR49505P0UU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just replaced my trusty ZS3 with the new ZS7 and, so far, I am very pleased with this camera. The output is much cleaner and smoother than the ZS3's, much more refined. Compared to the ZS7, the ZS3 produced images that look brittle and over-processed. As with virtually all small-sensor cameras, the ZS7's images are a little noisy (even at base ISO) if you look close enough. But noise is far less objectionable than ragged edges and smeared details, which is what I usually got from the ZS3. The images I'm getting from the ZS7 look surprisingly good even at 100% on-screen enlargement; whereas the ZS3's output was virtually unusable at this magnification. The improvement is dramatic. Considering that the ZS7's resolution has also increased from 10 to 12 MP (it's actually a 14 MP sensor that is masked to create different aspect ratios), I'd say that Panasonic has done a really good job here.The ZS7 improves on the ZS3 in several ways; but for me the most important new feature is Picture Adjustments, which let you turn down the amount of sharpening and noise reduction that are automatically applied to every image. Photographers who do their own post-processing will appreciate the ability to apply their own preferred methods of sharpening and noise reduction.The next most important new feature (imho) is the addition of aperture/shutter-priority shooting modes. There isn't much latitude for adjusting the f-stop in most small-sensor cameras because of defraction effects; but it's great to be able to control the shutter speed manually.The ZS7 also adds GPS, which can (thankfully) be turned off. Leaving it on shortens battery life.Other improvements that I appreciate include (1) improved image stabilization, (2) new Venus processing engine, (3) High Dynamic mode, and (4)  the LCD now has a good anti-glare coating.All things considered, the ZS7 is an impressive upgrade that is easily worth the price.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Progress is fast", "Author": "iestyn Bleasdale-Shepherd", "ReviewID": "R2UD4QC3M3AJ3G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the original camera in this line (the DMC-TZ1) three years ago and have absolutely loved using that camera. I have taken over 60,000 photos with it and couldn't be happier. I never suffered any kind of technical problem with it - I only decided to get the ZS7 (or TZ10, as it is known in Europe) because the new features I read about were so enticing! In just 3 years, this line has raced through 4 generations and the improvements are amazing - despite which the price has stayed exactly the same.Before I go into details, I should be clear as to what I personally am looking for in a camera, so that you may judge how relevant this review is to you. Things that I care about:-  I take photos everywhere I go, often at a moment's notice, so it must fit in my jacket pocket and be quick to use-  it must have a good zoom since that gives me the freedom to frame subjects tightly and remove them from context-  it should be good at macros since I love taking macro shots-  it needs to take photos with as close to SLR quality as possible, given that it's a compactIf you care about other things, like the packaged software (which I never use) or the various peripheral 'features' (e.g. face recognition, which btw does work - though sadly not on my cat ;) ), then this review may not provide the information you're most interested in.Anyway, here's what I've found in my first few weeks using the ZS7.Everything that I loved about the TZ1 is present in the ZS7, but in improved form:-  it's now even smaller and lighter-  I can get even closer for macros (down to 3cm!)-  I can zoom in even further (19x optical!)-  the awesome macro and zoom features now combine in the incredible 'telephoto macro' mode, which lets me focus on objects just 3 feet away at maximum zoom (the depth of field is simply gorgeous in these shots; bokeh like an SLR!). Definitely my new favourite feature!In addition, I have been enjoying these lovely enhancements:- image quality is improved along every axis:->  noise: in addition to generally lower noise levels, 'noise reduction' can now be turned OFF and the overall improvements to image quality are fantastic - the ugly 'grunge' in the pixel noise that the TZ1 had was probably its single worst feature, and that is now completely gone.->  dynamic range: images taken in bright sunlight are far less contrasty now, and I can take pictures of objects against the sky without ugly fringing and chromatic aberration around their silhouettes (as long as I get exposure right of course!)->  colour balance: automatic white balance is in a new league compared to the TZ1. I was constantly changing the custom white balance settings for the TZ1, but with the ZS7 I'm happy to just leave it on automatic white balance 99% of the time (quite a relief!). Overall, colours look much more natural - they match how the scene looks to my as well as the SLRs that I have used.- the new image stabilisation is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE - all but the most major jolts are smoothed out. This has a huge impact on the clarity of my shots when at max zoom or shooting in dim lighting (which let's face it is not the forte of these small-aperture compacts), and the jittery videos you'd expect from such a light camera are now smooth as butter. Really, really impressive.- speaking of video, the HD video is absolutely STUNNING. You could shoot cable TV on this thing.- minor but very welcome improvements:->  in-built lens cap (yay!)->  support for SDXC memory cards (I used to empty my TZ1's 2GB card every few days; my first 64GB card for the ZS7 isn't even a third full yet!)->  JPG compression artifacts are noticeably reduced->  the new program/aperture/shutter modes give me a little bit more control under certain circumstances (though not that much, given the small lens you get on a compact)->  the new UI is very streamlined (the quick menu is extremely useful and photo browsing is much quicker)->  GPS works well, and it's nice to have my photos automatically register on the world map once I upload them to Flickr.Just so I don't give the impression that I'm gushing uncontrollably, I should also mention the things that I don't like:-  I wish the quick menu was customizable (e.g. I'd like to be able to use it to change aspect ratio and set custom white balance)-  I'm disappointed that zoom+scroll in review mode isn't any quicker than before-  I really don't like losing the 'review' button (review 'mode' resets the lens after a couple of seconds, to frequently irritating effect)-  auto-focus isn't noticeably faster (one of the big general down-sides of compacts, unfortunately)-  there is the occasional encoding error when shooting videos, which Panasonic needs to fix in a firmware updateThose are pretty minor complaints, compared to all the great new features I'm enjoying. My old camera, beloved as it was just a couple of weeks ago, is already languishing on a shelf, all but forgotten! Before getting the ZS7, I would have whole-heartedly recommended the TZ1 to anyone that cares about the same things that I do (portability, flexibility and image quality), and the ZS7 stands head and shoulders above it in every regard.

After all reading tons of reviews and comparison charts, and live demos; the Winner is the ZS7.ZS7 Improvement over the ZS3:Manual settings (ZS3 is only auto w/o manual settings), 1/2.33\" CCD processor, 16X Intelligent Zoom/23.4X Zoom at 3 Meg resolutions, Sonic speed AF, Venus Engine HD II, Color Mode, Video divide, Happy & Custom Mode, Travel Mode \"GPS\", and more important Panasonic has moved the shutter button to its natural location (the ZS3 has the mode dial button placed closer to the finger, and the shutter button was somewhat far)Panasonic ZS7 vs. Panasonic LX3 vs. Canon S90:Panasonic LX3 and Canon S90 both offer better low light images due to lens opening at its widest aperture of f/2.0 that allow significantly more light versus the ZS7 f/3.3, also they offer RAW format and better light sensitivity, the ZS7 don't. However when it comes to the zoom power; LX3 offer only 2.5X and the S90 has 3.8X zoom, where the ZS7 has the best zoom in a compact size camera of 12X Optical, 16X Digital, and 23.4X extended zoom at around 3 mega pixel resolution. So it really depends on your needs and preference.The ZS7:This is a beautiful eye-catching camera; the all metal deep black color is Majestic, compact size but sturdy solid feel, you will love the astonishing 460K DPI 3\" wide LCD display. The camera has a very fast focus with auto tracking, almost no shutter-lag (0.006 of Second), flash recharges quickly and always ready to shot right away. The main attraction of this camera its 12X zoom, but it also can extend to 16X digital zoom with little or no loss of quality picture (see the first few pictures on the customer's images to see a real life zoom example and other modes). The GPS is nice but it consumes battery life even if the camera is turned off!! The good news is that you can turn if off if you don't need it. The camera has 15 MB internal memory, Stereo (right and left) microphone for recording and play back, faster 2.3 fps continuous shooting. The buttons and controls layout is easy and every thing makes sense; the dial has the auto, manual, and even custom setting for creative users, also there is a separate button for recording HD 720P video. Other features; Macro zoom, Panorama assist, Clipboard, ability to Zoom while recording movies, play back slide show with music, face detection, O.I.S., digital red-eye removal, and auto back light compensation. There a lot to mention about this camera, but I'm sure more experts reviews to follow. The only negative would poor low light images without the flash, the lack of mini HDMI cable to play back on HDTV, and the tiny little user guide is useless. A screen protector for the LCD screen is definitely recommended for any buyer.Finally, this is an Elegant, Sexy, and Powerful Camera that is sure to Satisfy.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-ZS7K Digital Camera", "Author": "Cyrus R. Mody \"Cyrus Mody\"", "ReviewID": "R3BR5QHBGC289M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently sold my JCV HD camcorder because I realized my lifestyle required me to take more still photos than videos.I did some extensive research and in the process learnt a few things I did not realize. I researched blogs, reviews, and other expert and end user forums including consumer reports trends for `brand' reliability, cNet reviews and many other popular electronics authorities.In my research I discovered that unless you are a professional photographer printing a 5 foot tall poster, for day to day use and the ability to `blow up a regular image to a reasonable size - most people do not need a camera with more than 6-8 megapixels. However if you get more megapixels then that is a bonus. (Something you get in the Panasonic DMC-ZS7K a total of 12.1 mega-pixels)On the other hand Zoom is a different matter. Getting a camera with good range in `Optical zoom' is always better. You might say to yourself \"I will never need to `zoom in' \"that far\" - trust me you will! And you will appreciate your decision. The Panasonic DMC-ZS7K has a total of 12x optical zoom which is also `Wide angle\" and the ability to add another 4x digital zoom giving you a total of 16x zoom). However to get crisp images you should try to stay within the `optical zoom' limitations (up to 16x).Now to review the actual camera:Model: Panasonic: DMC-ZS7KI have owned this camera for about 3 weeks now. Unpacking it was a breeze. It took a very short time to charge the battery. Once I plugged in the battery, programming the initial basic settings like the time and location, was easy. However while I have used the GPS feature, to be on the safe side (re battery draining) I keep my GPS `OFF'. If I am actively going to be in an area where I specifically want the `added' feature of the GPS then I will turn it on. BUT I will try to remember to turn it off as soon as I am done. Even if you power off your camera - as long as the battery is inserted in the unit the GPS will be running 24/7. This WILL drain you r battery.It took me a few hours to read through the manual and play (adjust) all the advanced settings. I don't think I will use the `advanced settings much but I will have it set to my liking when I am ready to use it.I have taken a handful of photos to test all the settings including the macro zoom. For the most part unless your environment absolutely demands `advanced' shutter and aperture settings the `iAF' mode works best. This camera in `iAF' mode (Intelligent Auto Focus) is a breeze. Just point and shoot. \"Even a caveman can do it\"In macro mode once again I found the AF Macro mode to work the best. Although if you are zoomed in to the object and switch from tele-macro to af-macro you will not see any change. You will need to physically zoom out and back in or move your camera away from the object and bring it back so it can refocus.ISSUES - QUIRKS:At this point I do not have any major complaints with this camera - except that for the price it could have come with a carry pouch (case) and at lease 8GB of memory. I have not yet bought a camera case but however bought 32GB of memory. [SanDisk 32GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card 200x - NEW 30MB/s version].  Again from research I have discovered that for true HD quality recording a Class-10 SDHC memory card is the best.I am taking a 2 week trip to Florida at the end of May 2010 and expect to use the camera extensively.Today I am happy with my decision and this camera.I will definitely come back and update this review after my trip.***************************************************************_______________27th June 2010:_______________Update from my trip to Florida.This is a follow up to my purchase of the Panasonic DMC-ZS7K.I am adding some photos to review.Overall the camera is great.Photo quality is `Excellent' ***** (5 star)HD Video quality is `Very Good' **** (4 star) only because it does not have an internal backlight.All the special settings work great.The `scene' mode works great. I found the `Beach' scene mode was sharper and more clear when used on the beach during mid-day in the hot sun as well as the `evening'. I shot some pictures with the camera pointing directly at the sun and still got a great result.There was some issue with the `Sunset' scene mode.I captured approximately 50 photos of one sunset over a period of 15-20 minutes.I used the following modes:- `Full Intelligent Auto' mode- `Beach' Scene mode- `Sunset' Scene modeIn my opinion the `Sunset' Scene mode was the worst.The second best was the `Beach' Scene mode.The best pictures were produced using the `Full Intelligent Auto' mode.I also traveled to the Florida Aquarium where I took some very good pictures using `Underwater' Scene mode. I was extremely impressed with two things:1. All my photos were great even though I took 90% of them through an Aquarium Tank Glass (see my photos attached to the product review).2. In some areas of the Aquarium we were not allowed to use a `Flash'. I forced the flash `off' and switched the camera to `Full Intelligent Auto' mode.In all cases the colors were very good.In a couple of instances I used the `BURST' mode you can see in my `posted' photos I have a picture of a turtle swimming in full speed.NEGATIVES:I tried very hard to find something negative to say but could only come up with this:1. The shooting mode wheel can sometimes `half turn' while in your pocket or bag. So when you try to start it up and shoot you will see an error on the screen! The locking mechanism could have been tighter?2. The screen definitely needs a `very good quality' protective plastic screen covering it. I purchased this from Amazon.com that works perfectly: Garmin Nuvi 755T ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector (Single Pack)3. Te last negative comment I have on this camera would be to have the unit ship out with some sort of case?! It is amazing that a camera costing as much as this does is sold without a case!CONCLUSION:This camera is a keeper (with a good screen protector and a carry case :) LOL)", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera. Exceeded my expectations", "Author": "David Luis Pereira", "ReviewID": "R389K2QVFXXPIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Things that exceeded my expectations/Pros:- GPS accuracy was good (when updated)- Video stabilization worked really well- Image quality when optical zoom was at max was very good- A lot more manual control than I expected- Battery life with GPS on wasn't that bad. Noticed about a 25% reduction with taking photos (no flash) during a 3 hour period.Cons:- not thrilled with the button layout... need to get used to it.I primarily bought this camera over other cameras because of the integrated GPS and HD video. I knew ahead of time it was 720p. For what I need, 720p is fine and I'm quite impressed with the video quality. Another reviewer mentioned a high pitched noise. My camera doesn't make this sound. I can hear high pitched frequencies pretty good and I didn't hear any coming from the videos I took.With regards to the GPS, I was a bit skeptical at first and heard a lot of complaints about battery draining. I took the camera on the first day I got it for a test drive at the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The photos were easy to get off my camera with the included usb cable and geotagged directly into Flickr with ease.I had GPS on for about 3 hours during our visit and with taking photos, I drained about 1/4 of the battery. For 3 hours on all the time, this didn't seem too bad. I was expecting worse based on others comments. I was also impressed with the resolution of the GPS location. I wasn't sure if the GPS was just going to just report one spot at the park, but you can see from the flickr page that it was able to locate my exact position throughout the park. The update can be a bit off. The GPS was updating within 5 minute periods, so when riding in the tram at the park, it wasn't always exactly where I took the picture. One nice feature is that you can request to have the location updated at anytime.The image quality in light conditions is very good and I'm very impressed with the zoom and how clear pictures still are with full optical zoom. I haven't tested dark conditions yet. I like the balance of it's ease of use and the flexibility of having a lot of manual controls.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can't Beat it", "Author": "Ray T", "ReviewID": "R31QF2EUUEZPSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from a DMC-ZS1 because I wanted the aperture priority mode (and okay, manual mode in general!!)  The GPS was just an added plus.  I use this as my \"walk around\" camera (restaurants, parks etc.) when on long trips and for \"everyday\" shots...like parties, BBQs etc.  Have taken it out on two outings now and snapped about 200 shots.  As with the previous ZS series, the zoom and overall pic quality for a point and shoot are outstanding.  It makes a great \"travel camera.\"  Fairly speedy to turn on and zoom times are quick.  I have read the new board is easier on the battery, but I have not had to charge it after the first time (ps.  I bought and am using some 3rd party batteries...work just great...will review them in the future.)  A feature I really enjoy is the ability to set up 3 \"programs\"--with your settings for all kinds of things.  So I have my \"normal\" set up in program 1, my tripod set up (auto bracketing, anti-shake off, iso 100 etc.)in program 2 and an indoor/fast program in 3.  It is really nice to just load your \"normal\" program if you have been messing about with a few things trying to get a better picture.  I also like the \"quick menu\" button which opens a menu with commonly tweaked items such as white balance, focus type etc.  GPS has surprised me, as I don't have it in my car, but when wandering down by the river near my house, it correctly identified a golf course which was just across the water.  Okay, it is a \"relatively\" inexpensive (compared to my DSLR and lenses) camera...so what are the trade-offs.  Well, no viewfinder (although the larger and brighter LCD has been great) and it is a little hard to \"dial in\" the exact zoom you want as it is motorized.  This isn't the strongest flash in the world and some indoor shots are a little noisy.  But all in all, this is a great little point and shoot.ps Wanted to add that I have taken this out, several times, for a full day of shooting.  So far, the battery will do maybe 250 photos (with GPS turned off) before it wants power.  Also the battery power meter is deceptive....showing 2/3 full when I was about 25 shots from needing more power.  None of this changes my overall opinion of the camera and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  Just get a spare battery or bring the charger!!", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect...", "Author": "Anthony Pantliano \"The Photo Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R20B18FYKYK9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix ZS7 seems like the ideal midsize camera.  It has a powerful lens with a great wide angle, a 3\" high-resolution screen, full manual controls, stereo HD movies, and GPS picture tagging.  It's not perfect, however, and leaves something to be desired when it comes to shooting in low light.The ZS7 is a decent sized camera.  It can fit comfortably into a jacket pocket, but you're not going to be slipping it into your pant's pocket.  It's nicely constructed and feels solid in the hand.  The body is made of metal, including the tripod mount.  The only flimsy part of the camera is the battery door.  It's just a thin and cheap plastic flap.  There is a small handgrip on the back of the camera and a bulge on the front that helps you to grip the camera.  All of the buttons and dials are easy to reach and feel high quality.Using the ZS7 is fairly easy.  For novices, or those who prefer to just point and shoot, you can leave the camera in iA (for Intelligent Auto) and it will decide the settings for you while also locking out most of the menu options.  There are also three setting on the mode dial for the various scene modes.  The camera has many scene modes, some of which are more of a gimmick than anything else.  The three scene mode positions allows for two of them to be memorized to your favorite scene mode, so you can pick your favorites more quickly.  Two of the more unique scene modes are the \"Baby\" and \"Pet\" scene modes.  Those modes allow you to enter the name of your baby or pet and its birthday.  It will then tell you how old they were when the picture was taken.  For those who prefer to have more control over the camera there are the full manual modes (P, A, S, M) and a custom mode on the dial to save your favorite setting (bear in mind that the Aperture Priority mode is a bit limited as you can't select an aperture smaller than 6.3).  The camera has many different focusing modes, ranging from face detection, to motion tracking, to high-speed single area.  The camera also allows you to exposure bracket and bracket by ratio (4:3, 3:2, or 16:9) while preserving the same field of view.  Lastly, the ZS7 also allows you control over the amount of noise reduction, sharpness, contrast, and saturation when in any of the manual modes.The camera operates fairly quickly and is ready to shoot in about 4 seconds.  Shoot to shoot times are pretty speedy as well, especially when you are not using flash.  If you pre-focus, shutter lag is not an issue either.  Battery life is a bit disappointing.  Using the built-in GPS I was getting about 200 shots out of a charge.  This included a bit of zooming, a couple of short movies, and some photo reviewing.  I do not use the flash much, and even so, the battery life is weak.  I think it has more to do with the GPS than anything.  So be cautious when using this feature, and turn it off when you aren't.Speaking of, the built in GPS is one of the main reasons I bought this camera.  The GPS will geo-tag your photos so you can view on your computer where you took the various shots.  This makes the camera ideal for those who like to go hiking, but it can be useful for everyone, and it's kind of neat.  The GPS takes a minute or so to get its initial lock, but after that it updates itself every couple of minutes and is usually accurate.  There is a built-in database of points-of-interest and if you are near one it will tag your photo as such.  For instance, when I was shooting in NYC's Central Park, it marked the photo as being in Shakespeare's Gardens, which was correct.  Sometimes it guesses wrong though, and you can turn that feature off if you'd prefer to.  Obviously the GPS will only function outdoors and works best with a clear view of the sky.One of the best aspects of shooting with the ZS7 with is its long and versatile zoom range.  You can go from a very wide 25mm to a decent telephoto.  Until just a couple of years ago camera's with this type of range used to be quite bulky, but the ZS7 packs a powerful lens into a small camera.  The wide angle on the ZS7 is very helpful when shooting indoors or in tight spaces as you can fit more into the photo than you can with a non-wide angle camera.  Moreover, the lens is sharp from corner to corner and from wide angle to telephoto (though is does soften a bit at full telephoto).  There is no vignetting, barrel distortion, or purple fringing to speak of either (that's because the camera removes the last two automatically).  The lens also has a built-in image stabilizer, which allows you to take photos in lower light and at full telephoto with less blur.  The only downside to the lens is the maximum aperture is f/3.3 at wide angle.  I was shooting with a friend and her camera had a maximum aperture of 2.8 and she was able to take sharp pictures in low light because of it, while I had to raise the ISO with the ZS7 to get the same shots.Photo quality on the ZS7 is a bit of a mixed bag.  The colors and exposure are usually accurate, and in bright light at the lowest ISO speed, photos are sharp and detailed and don't have much noise.  However, once you start going up the ISO range, or the light levels fall, noise and noise reduction artifacts rear their ugly head.  In fact I don't like to shoot at anything above ISO 200 because the photos start to look more like paintings than photographs.  The camera obviously has a noisy sensor and Panasonic combats that by blurring the noise, and hence the details, away.  With that said if you're not as picky as I am, and don't crop or blow up your photos very much, you will probably be more than happy with the results.  If however, you like to shoot in low light you're probably better off picking up a camera like the Panasonic LX5, Canon G12, Canon S95, or Canon SD4000 IS.  Keep in mind, though, that none of those cameras have the zoom range and built-in GPS of the ZS7 though.  Movie quality on the ZS7 is terrific though.  The camera records movies at 720 HD resolution with stereo sound and you can use the optical zoom while recording.All in all... if you're looking for a versatile pocket camera you can't go wrong with the feature packed ZS7.  If you like to shoot in low light there are better options though.P.S.:  If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I will respond as quickly as possible.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lumix ZS7 vs. Canon S90", "Author": "Paul Kim \"macho paul\"", "ReviewID": "R190MYFKXMP6TT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Top two selling point and shoot digital camera on Amazon...I personally bought ZS7 and coworker next to me has bought Canon S90 and we both decided to test and review our products.* Picture quality: They both outputs beautiful pictures (almost DSLR like) but S90 wins this catagory by hair margin.  S90 pictures are richer and clearer and more detailed.  But as I mentioned, not by a big margin.  ZS7's biggest issue is the low light shots whereas S90 does well under same conditions.  ZS7 has 16x optical zoom with awesome image stabilizer with works well together.  This equals the maximum range of 300mm zooming.  S90 has 3x optical zoom.* Function / Ease of use: ZS7 has more functions and they are very easy to use.  On a same token S90 being Canon, it's also easy to use but with less functions.  They both have Auto shooting modes which automatically sets up the shooting mode beautifully.  Also, note that ZS7 has built-in GPS (global positioning system) for geo-tagging, which camera automatically sorts pictures by location when viewing later.  This option also can be turned off in case you don't need it.  They both have sturdy metal casings, which is a bit heavier to carry around.  ZS7 weighs about 1 ounce more than S90 and it takes toll when holding a camera with one hand.  Buttons for both camera are well laid out and easy to use.  They both offer beautiful, 3 inch, 460,000 pixels LCD screen which tops most of the other digicams.* Movie mode: ZS7 wins this catagory hands down.  S90 is built mainly for taking quality pictures but ZS7 delivers HD, 720p to be exact, stereo audio recording with 16x zoom altogether.  This works flawlessly just like a HD camcoder.  One downside of this HD recording with high resolution is the need for higher capacity SD memory.  With 4GB I have, I was able to record upto 35 minutes or so of HD movie at highest settings but you may want to buy at least 8GB.* Design: S90 has more clean and simple design whereas ZS7 has more heavier and bulkier feel to it.  S90 has rounder and softer edges whereas ZS7 has more of a boxy feel to its design.  S90 has built in flash, which automatically pops in and out when needed which gives cleaner look.  Of course, the 16x Leica lens on ZS7 is larger and heavier on the downside thus resulting in 1 ounce heavier unit.* Verdict: If you are into video recording as well as picture taking, you will be very satisfied with ZS7 with it's high specs of zooming and recording power.

Bought it from Amzon and my wife took it with her to a 4-day mexico cruise with her high school reunion. It was a disappointment in several areas. It is slow after power on, slow at focusing, slow after taking a shot ... And the power seems to drain fast. Heats up after taking some 1080p videos.After her cruise trip and hearing all the complaints, I returned it thanks to Amazon's no hassle return policy.And then after reading a ton of reviews, I decided to get the ZS7 even though many reviewers said it is not good at low light. The features that are important to me are, wide angle (could not believe SD4500 did not keep what was in SD4000), GPS (a lot of fun to see it on map), 12x zoom. I did not care too much about all the controls since I wanted a simple Point and Shoot but they are pretty easy to use and raised my interests to learn more about using them.The following are my findings.  - first thing we found is it is very fast on everything it does. The only notice-able delay is when it saves video or when I user slower shutter speed (like >1 second). I do not remember my other old cameras but SD4500 was a lot slower on basic operations.  - Wide angle is awesome, I do not think I will ever buy a camera without it.  - Color is a little dull but I could adjust it by turn on \"Happy\" in iA mode. I believe people said Panosonic tends to be more \"realistic\" on the color, other brands tend to be a little more \"colorful\". This is really not a problem to me but others may have different taste.  - GPS is great, a lot of fun to see your picture on map where they are taken. With 3 batteries (I bought 2 more), I plan to turn GPS on all time.  - Low light performance is not good but since I read the reviews and my expectation was not high, so I cannot really say I was disappointed. However, I do not really feel it is any worse than the other P&S; I owned before.  - Video quality is great but the windy noise is annoying. I found the windy noise would go away if there are some sound to be recorded, so a solution is to talk more while you take the video.All in all, people need to realize this is a P&S.; For $250 on Amazon, it is by far the best performance and feature rich camera one can buy now.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera until Panasonic ruined the product.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Computer junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R3CFHUIMG1XI5H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great camera and we have really enjoyed the camera.

Yes you can get better results from a camera that costs ten times more and weighs ten times more. One \"professional\" whines that the ZS7 does not focus well in inadequate light. Well, I don't know of any camera that works in inadequate light. With only so many photons to go around, there is nothing Panasonic can do to supersede the laws of physics. When you attempt to make handheld exposures in the dark, something has to give. The ZS7 provides exposure control, not miracles. So steady the camera, use less sensitive ISO settings, and leave the shutter open longer. The resulting images will be consistently sharp and clear. The ZS7 makes it easy to do this, if you really want the pictures. If you just want to complain, find a more credible topic.If you want to publish your photos in NatGeo, get a 5 pound camera + $10,000 of lenses + helicopter. While the pros are lugging gear and setting up, I'll be moving on to the spectacular sites they can't get to. And here's the money: The ZS7 costs much less than just the 1st year's depreciation of a dSLR. So be bold. Put it in a freezer jar and swim behind that waterfall. Take it skiing and climbing. You'll barely notice the load.The point is that this camera weighs 220 grams and can record things, near and far, that bare eyes cannot see, and where large, expensive cameras dare not go. Maybe you'd like to see a closeup of that little splinter before you go digging around for it. One time I made a nice picture of Mercury rising. I knew when and where to point the camera, but never could actually see the planet. But it was a bright spot in the images.The ZS7 is tiny, but allows me to keep astounding photographic capability at hand. It's always with me in the car and on the trail, ready for something interesting to happen. I carried it all over the Southwest and the entire length of Vermont on foot. It has recorded thousands of memories, coping with rain, snow, dust, and a 105\u00ba temperature range, and--I'm ashamed to say--much too much rough handling. It was kicked all around my tent. Knocked out of shelter bunks. Thwacked with countless tree branches. I actually throw it onto the passenger seat every time I get in the car.The big bright screen is wonderful. Yes you can use it as a flashlight when you get caught out too late in the wild. (Keep an all white image in the camera memory for this. It might save your life.) The long optical zoom is amazing. It takes you so far out, you need to brace the camera. It does very well in dim light; I can't recall the last time I used the flash. (But I do brace a lot.) The SD card flips right into my MacBook Air, so I stay light and fast; no fooling around with a USB cable.Not only do you get a telescope and a microscope with your travel camera, it's a navigational device too. I don't have much need for that, but in a pinch, there's your GPSr, timepiece, compass, and maps. Yes you can store perfectly usable digital images of your maps in discrete camera memory, access them quickly, and zoom/pan all over them. All with no added weight or bulk. For ultralight backpacking, it's an antigravity device, saving more weight than it actually weighs. Here's a true story ...On the Long Trail one day, it was hot and I was dizzy, and maybe I walked right by one of my food caches. I didn't want to waste precious time and energy on a guess. So I sat down for a snack under the full forest canopy, and let the ZS7 find my position. Yes, my cache was a \u00bc mile back. With the confidence that comes from solid information, I hid my pack and trotted back to the cache. I had made a mistake, but the camera allowed me to carry on my adventure with minimal effort and anxiety. How can you put a price on that?My advice: If you can't get terrific images from the ZS7, get out there and learn to be a better photographer. I promise, this camera will not hold you back.

I won't bother with all that. All I'd like to say is that I came to Amazon after owning my ZS7 for a year now and I love the camera so much that I wanted to add my own five star review.This November I was lucky enough to be able to attend a Sarah McLachlan concert at Austin City Music Hall. Like most indoor concerts the lighting was dim and only concentrated on stage. The venue had very loose camera rules but the one they did have was the \"no flash\" rule. The ZS7 performed like a champ and it allowed me to capture some amazing images from that day that I'll be able to keep with me for a long time. It also allowed me to grab spectacular video footage so I could relive hearing many of Sarah's songs instead of just looking at still pictures.I've added a few of the shots from that day to the customer images. These were all taken with the \"sports\" preset and no flash.The video was taken with default settings as well - it actually looked a little better when it was originally taken; unfortunately my smallest video was 168mb and I couldn't find a good, free video editor with which to crop the file down to Amazon's required size of less than 100mb. However I think the final result still does a pretty good job of conveying the ZS7's video capture features.(*edit - I've re-encoded and re-uploaded the video to Amazon in full 720p, but I think Amazon automatically downgrades it for streaming purposes; I promise that the original video that the camera takes is of a *much better* quality than what's shown here on this review. If you're curious about seeing the video that this camera takes in full 720p, please feel free to check out my YouTube channel:  you tube . com / stormpenguin (sorry for the weird format, Amazon will auto-edit it if I write it correctly).", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Totally Lacking Where It Really Counts", "Author": "PAJOMA", "ReviewID": "R328OSMSU5JXYK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is loaded with lots of great features and is overall pretty easy to use, but I found the picture quality very disappointing.  I am a professional photographer and wanted a good compact camera for the family to carry around and use and decided this would even satisfy me when I needed to use it too.  We used it for 4 weeks and took over 1000 photos and I had plenty of either totally out of focus or just not sharp photos.  If there's plenty of light, the performance is great, but anytime there's not enough light for use without the flash things go downhill in a hurry for the photo quality.  The painfully long lag time between pressing the button and the photo being taken also ruined many great opportunities too.  The video camera performed a little better, but still was not impressed with the over quality either.  Not totally sharp either and seemed like a slow frame rate creating a choppy feel to the video.  Returning this for a refund.************************************As an update to the above review based on the comments from all the \" expert critics\" out there.  I'm sorry if you don't uphold the same standards when it comes to image quality as I do as a professional photographer of over 20 years, but it seems that sadly that is the case with a lot of things today.  Folks are fine with accepting decent results, and even believing they are excellent, because the other options are of lesser quality.  If you're OK with A LOT of blurry photos combined with a loooooooooooooooong lag delay that makes it near impossible to capture that just right moment on a live subject then yes, this is the camera for you.  If like me, you expect the best results, and only give 5 star reviews when deserved, then stay away from this camera.  And no, as a professional photographer it did not take me over 1000 photos to figure out that I was getting blurry photos. I played around with all the settings trying to get something, anything that would work consistently, and it was always the same thing... in bright sunlight everything was great, but if it was even an overcast day the results were not good a lot of the time.  Sure there were some good quality photos, and I expect a few bad ones with any camera, none get it right all of the time when depending on auto-focus.  I'm just saying this camera blew it too often (10-15% of the time when lighting conditions were good) to be considered a viable option.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb camera -- but don't buy it!", "Author": "Tom Newby", "ReviewID": "R44XGU6YVW8P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had three cameras in this series, going back several years.  I have loved them all.  Great cameras, each better than the one before, and I figured I would be buying nothing else but Panasonic cameras in the future.BUT -- Panasonic just started using something they call an \"ID secured\" battery.  The upshot of that is, no aftermarket batteries can be used in it -- only the wildly overpriced Panasonic brand.  When you put any other brand in the camera the screen comes up with \"this battery will not work in this camera\". Panasonic updated the firmware to detect an ID code from their battery so that aftermarket ones won't work.  If I have to pay $60 or so for the Panasonic replacement battery instead of the $10 or so that an aftermarket battery costs, the camera just becomes too expensive to use.  So I am headed to another brand, and it disappoints me that Panasonic is scamming its buyers this way.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7", "Author": "A. Visconti", "ReviewID": "R325TWCMI809RF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is all about its lens, a 12x optical zoom by Leica.  I have a couple of Nikon DSLRs that I take \"serious\" pictures with, but they are too heavy to drag around just to take advantage of  a candid, unexpected photo opportunity.  I always carry a compact camera but found the various Canon and Fujifilm cameras just falling short of high quality photos in sharpness and definition (and the iPhone is way too low in quality for my taste).  The Lumix outperforms any compact I've ever owned for producing professional looking quality.  It is a little slow to release the shutter, its only weakness, but I have it set to highest resolution which takes a little longer to \"write\" in memory.  I have used it in rock clubs with a \"stage\" preset which made the performers look healthy with no washed-out skin tones, and the stage lights look great with complete black where areas in the picture should be totally black, not a dark gray.  The camera handles low light levels pretty well, some noise is evident when pushed, but I expect that.  With the presets it is really easy to balance the ambient light with the built-in flash rendering results that Pros get with thousands of dollars of gear.  I just came back from a week in the Caribbean and the photos were sharper than I expected and the subtle shades of water and foliage were breathtaking.  I even took long exposures at night, 60 seconds on a pocket tripod, that had an amazing range of color with no noise.  I haven't tried the HD video part of the camera yet.  It makes videos in \"AVCHD Lite,\" a format I am not familiar with.  All the software included is for PC only and I use a Mac, so I might need something else to convert these movies into iMovie.  There is a DVD included with the camera's full manual (which I put on my Kindle), all you get on paper is a 'quick start' tutorial.  The camera has a wide range of programmed settings from Portrait to Sports that work great.  It also has a GPS facility that stamps map coordinates on your photo (but it must be switched off on a flight).All in all this a great compact camera that takes the sharpest pictures I've seen at this size and price.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can you get anything better?", "Author": "Collin Zeng", "ReviewID": "R2ZBSFYKNVPZQ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ZS7 is incredibly inexpensive right now. For the price I brought it for, you can't get anything better. Can you get a good camcorder for under 300 that records HD? No, unless you get a Flip with no optical zoom. Can you get a camera that takes better pictures? No, unless you get a Fuji F200EXR or scour the market for used deals. But then, the F200EXR's video isn't nearly as good as the ZS7's 720p output with stereo sound.I tested this camera at ISO 1600, and it was completely usable with noise reduction set to -2. There was luminance noise, but almost no chroma noise, and detail was fairly well retained considering the limitations of a small sensor camera. Looked good even at 100%.The colors are really good too. I thought that no camera would be able to match my Kodak DX7590's warm output. I heard stories about how Panasonic color was wacky and all that. Nope, not with the ZS7. The color is excellent - warm, balanced, not unnatural.Detail is great too with the sharp, contrasty lens. I cannot say enough good things about this camera. The video mode is excellent too. Just about everyhting with this camera is great, even picture quality, as long as you set noise reduction to -2 if you don't like smeared details. -2 will reduce the amount of noise reduction, making the pictures nosier, however detail is better retained. It's all up to you, play around with the noise reduction to find your balance of a smooth looking picture with the amount of detail retained.Going on about the positive would be redundant - all the other reviews also cover what I would cover.This camera only has some minor cons. I'll list them below:1) Feels a tad heavier than it looks. But that contributes to how solid it feels as well. The ZS7 is actually very small. After looking at numerous online pictures of it, I was expecting a rather big camera. Nope, it's tiny compared to my expectations.2) Not exactly pocketable. I wouldn't put it in a jeans pocket - it's a tight squeeze. Cargo pants, no problem. No need to risk cracking the huge 3 inch LCD.3) Flash placement. If you don't watch out, you may cover the flash with your fingers. Not a major problem - you'll adjust.4) Anemic grip. A little small. But I'm coming from a SLR-styled Kodak DX7590 with a big beefy handgrip. Use a GOOD wrist strap and you'll be fine.5) Cheap included wrist strap. The one it comes with is poor. It doesn't even have an adjustment buckle to securely fit it around your wrist. And the eyelet for attaching wrist straps is very very small. It's not going to be big enough for all wrist straps.So I tied the included wrist strap on the ZS7, and then tied my higher quality wrist strap around the included wrist strap. Now I have two wrist straps, which gives me the feeling of security that I used to get only with a neck strap. I would hate to drop this beautifully crafted camera. If it had two eyelets on either side of the camera for a neck strap, I would be in heaven.6) Microphone placement. They are on the top of the camera. Not exactly the best place, but then they aren't easily covered by your fingers7) Camera LCD freezes for a split second if you first lock focus, then release the shutter button without taking a picture - e.g. you lock focus but want to refocus.8) A physical switch brings you in/out playback mode. Ugh. Why can't we have a button to pull up the images? And if you are in playback mode for more than a short period of time, the lens retracts. Often times, when reviewing images for just a short period of time, the lens will retract. Then when I exit playback mode to take more pictures, the lens has to re-extend. What's the point? Sometimes people just want to review images for a short period of time!9) Small internal memory. You have about 8 MB of free internal memory. My Kodak had 32 MB - enough for a dozen photos. On the ZS7 - 2 at full resolution.10) Manual intervention needed for best results. Pictures come out noisy when using the Intelligent Auto mode in less than optimal conditions because it insists on using 1/30 for the shutter speed. That doesn't make ANY SENSE AT ALL!. First off, the thing has an incredibly powerful image stabilization system that Panasonic claims to have an effectiveness of 4 stops! Only if you didn't have any form of image stabilization would you want to shoot at 1/30 at full wide angle due to the reciprocity guideline for choosing a shutter speed. So to achieve 1/30, the camera bumps up the ISO often to 800. Results are not as good as they can be. I can hand hold the camera with one hand with my arm fully extended to get a self-portrait of my self at 1/2 of a second with almost no blur. So I use manual exposure mode to manually set shutter speed.11) Anemic flash. Doesn't provide sufficient power to act as a fill flash on sunny days. Lower shutter speed to augment the flash power as outlined earlier.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best deal for your money", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R1HC6JD8JF83CY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this one with Amazon for my wife a month ago. So I compared the photos with those of my Canon 40D. I must say that I can't tell the difference. Embarrassed isn't it?You probably know that a new model called ZS8 comes out this month (March 2011) to replace this ZS7. My advice is buy the ZS7 and save you $100 or more without feeling ambivalent. Here's why:1 Megapixels is a marketing ploy. 12 in this case is more than enough. Other components such as the size of the sensor and the quality of the lens are just as important. What if I give you a fancy title like Senior Executive Vice President and you only make $8 an hour!2. Zoom range - The ZS7 has the most practical range. My experience says the 25 wide angle is much more important than 300 mm. Any zoom beyond 12 times (or 300 equivalent) is silly. Don't forget that the larger the zoom, the more distorted the image will become.3. GPS -The newer model ZS8 gives you 1 million GPS locations instead of half a million with the ZS7. But I wonder if you spend a lot of money and time on your favorite vacation spot, why would you forget the name of the place where the photos are taken? It's more to do with senior moment! Plus, if you don't shut off the GPS feature, it's still on even if you turn off the camera. That will drain the battery. This is an example of high-tech bragging right that has nothing to do with enhancing your photo skill. It's like the 8-speed transmission in expensive automobiles, which won't make your 5 or 6 speed any less efficient.4. Video: The quality is way more than enough for Youtube or sharing with friends and family members - unless you plan to go to the Sundance festival.Folks, I used to pay $650 plus tax for an Olympus 5-meg model with horrible delay in 2003. This one is truly light years ahead. By the way Consumer Report puts Panasonic digital cameras on top of the reliability index. You enjoy Leica lens quality too.Final word: Don't get obsessed with high-tech features you don't need. Spend more time on improving your photo skill instead. Between you and me, even my wife agrees.

Hughey", "ReviewID": "R7N7X33VWLO5M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am over all very impressed with this camera.  My frame of reference is a couple of Canon Powershot A-series cameras that are a few years old (a530 and a710 IS) and a Canon Rebel XS DSLR camera.Features-Pros:  This camera has tons of features, starting with a great wide-angle (which has really impressed me with its ability to get so much into the frame; I find myself not needing to back up at all), to a strong zoom, which gets in plenty close.  I find the zoom range to be very impressive, considering the compact size of the camera, and this was one of the big selling points for me.  The 3\" 460k LCD screen is really impressive- not just bright, but very sharp and exhibiting excellent contrast.  The only caveat here is that the screen seems to give the images a higher saturation than what you'll see on a monitor and prints.  720p HD movie mode is great, and while 1080P would of course be better, packing even 720P with a 12x optical zoom into such a small camera body is pretty impressive.  The GPS is also pretty cool, but I haven't really played around with it much.  The Intelligent Auto mode does most of thinking for you, automatically switching settings (and displaying the automatic settings on the screen for you), and generally taking excellent shots.  Manual controls are also available, allowing you to set up shots how you want, if preferred.  There is a large variety of Scene modes, with some of them proving very useful, as I'll talk about later.  Zoom speed is variable, which is nice.Cons:  I have three complaints when it comes to features.  First, while the proprietary battery makes sense in that it's much smaller than a pair of AA's, allowing the camera to be smaller, Panasonic makes it difficult to use anything but their own, high-priced batteries.  They claim it's to protect the camera from poor quality off-brand batteries, but the requirement sure doesn't hurt Panasonic's bottom line.  The Lumix Power Kit, sold through Amazon.com, does work with this camera, however, and for the price of 1 Panasonic battery, you get 2 batteries and a charger.  Next, you've got the proprietary USB connection.  Really, Panasonic?  The ONLY reason I can think of for a proprietary USB connection on a camera is to make more profit.  The proprietary USB slot is actually bigger than a micro-USB slot.  I have not been able to find any off-brand replacements for this cable.  Finally, while there is an HDMI port, which is very nice to have, the package doesn't include a mini-HDMI cable, so that must be purchased separately.Image Quality-Pros:  Relative to my past experiences (even including the Canon Rebel XS DSLR), the pictures taken from this camera are bright.  The camera seems to really make the best of the available lighting in a given area, and the result is clean, bright images.  As long as there is sufficient available lighting, the images don't exhibit any graininess or murkiness at all.  And yes, average indoor lighting is definitely sufficient for this camera.  There is a downside to this, however, which I'll mention later.  Images taken with sufficient lighting are crisp, but not noisy.  In Intelligent Auto (iA), I see sharp outlines between objects, but smooth skin.  There are some useful scene modes on this camera, including a very impressive Starry Night scene with selectable shutter speeds of 15, 30 or 60 seconds.  Simply mount the camera on a tripod in a dark room or outside at night, choose starry night, and the result is an impressively lit image with minimal noise- the images look almost surreal.  HDR mode gives you a couple of options, with the result of either a natural looking image with impressive shadow and highlight detail or an arty looking image with impressive shadow and highlight detail.Cons:  There are two negatives when it comes to image quality on this camera.  First, just like any point-and-shoot camera, high-ISO speeds breed noisy images.  If there isn't sufficient lighting, you can either have a dark picture (if you force ISO to max out at 400), or a noisy picture.  I wouldn't say that it's worse than other point-and-shoots, but it's amazing how much better a DSLR looks in low-lighting situations.  Second, this camera blows highlights with amazing consistency.  Maybe it's a side-effect of the bright, clean images, but I find that the brightest area of every picture I take is blown (i.e. pure white).  Even shooting in HDR mode, where the camera averages three different exposures in an effort to improve highlight and shadow detail, doesn't fix this problem.  Auto-bracketing helps (and it's nice that the camera has this feature), but I definitely think that the blown highlights are the biggest weakness of this camera.  Obviously, a DSLR camera does a better job with highlights, but then both of the Canon A-series cameras I have used also handle highlights better.  The trade-off is murkier pictures with the Canons.  I prefer the extra brightness, but you can only do so much in Photoshop with over-exposed areas.  I wouldn't call it a deal-breaker by any means, but just be advised that if you're seeking perfection, you should move along and look at DSLR's.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "A.

After lots of research, I settled on the Lumix DMC-ZS7.  This is my first digital point-and-shoot camera.What I like about this camera...1. Really nice, compact size with a large, bright LCD screen.2. Love the GPS tagging3. High quality video4. Fairly easy to set up and simple menu options5. Very good photos outdoorsWhat I do not like about this camera...1. Poor quality indoor photos2. Cannot review photo without switching camera from \"record\" mode to \"play\" mode3. Weak flashMy motivation to purchase a point and shoot was primarily for indoor photos at parties, etc., where the light is generally not great.  I had 2 occasions to use this camera in these situations and it did not do a great job in either case.  I primarily used the camera in its iAuto mode, which I realize is often not the best mode to use for ANY digital camera.  However, I am really looking for a camera where it has a decent auto mode so I don't have to think about the photo and can just shoot.  The photos I was getting using iAuto were really poor.  LOTS of noise at most ISO levels, and basically unusable at ISOs above 400 when focus distance was over 10 feet or so.  When focal distance was under 10 feet, or when shooting in well lit situations, this camera did a good job.  I also shot in Program mode, whose only advantage was that I could define the upper end of the allowable ISO adjustment.  However, given that I was getting unacceptable noise starting at 400, and it was difficult to shoot indoors at under 400, I didn't get much better results in that mode.  I also shot in aperture and shutter priority modes, with mixed results.My other complaints with the camera are minor, and likely apply to just about all point-and-shoot cameras.  I don't like having the toggle the camera into a separate mode to review the photos that I have taken.  The flash has a rather limited reach-- under 10 feet I would guess.Ultimately, I have decided to return the camera.  The high noise photos in indoor situations is just not acceptable to me.

I had been a religious Canon camera user previously, but after being fed up with the limitations on the zoom (Canon 4x vs. Panasonic 12x), I decided to purchase a Panasonic Lumix. I am an avid backpacker, and wanted something that could really capture the beauty of the great outdoors, during the day and at night. In addition I wanted to have a camera that's really versatile, capturing birthday parties, evening dinners, concerts, etc.I have owned this camera for about 10 months. Within 5 months of owning this camera I began to encounter problems with the zoom. The camera gives a \"System Error: Zoom\" and shuts off. All of the smart features that people have reviewed are very compromised. Without a flash I can't hope to capture a crisp image after dusk. The zoom no longer works after a 5x range. My prints are pixelated.I have taken great care of this camera because I felt it was a great investment. Camera case, never dropped it.

Just beware that if anything goes wrong, I doubt Panasonic will help you recover your losses. A local repair shop will charge 150+ dollars. Those costs just don't make sense for point-and-shoots.And, just so you know, before this camera, I owned a Canon Powershot for 5+ years. I only upgraded because the technology was out of date.

I am traditionally a Canon fanboy, so it was hard for me to leave the bandwagon and sign on with a new brand, but I am now a Canon/Panasonic fanboy (with a hint of Pentax DSLR mixed in).  First off, the zoom lens is superb and produces clear shots from end to end, and with the i.zoom function you get 16x effective zoom capability.  The image stabilization is top-notch, making it possible to shoot still scenes in low light with low ISO, which makes it great for no-flash shots in museums and other indoor exhibitions.  Low light performance is excellent, and the dynamic range is great for a point-and-shoot portable (especially with the i.exposure setting turned on).  The macro function (AF macro) is very good and would be excellent for technical photography because there is very little distortion or softness in the images (but avoid the 'macro zoom function' - see cons below).  There is a built-in high-dynamic range (HDR) mode that works really nice and makes amazing B&W; photos if you are interested in artsy photography.  What really strikes me is the technical accuracy and clearness of the shots, which would make this camera excellent for scientific and technical work, and the GPS is a major bonus there.  Every good review has cons, so here are mine:  Cons - the menu system is different than Canon and it takes a little time getting used to the fact that the center button gets you *out* of a menu (it's not a select button).  The \"macro zoom\" function is disappointing b/c it uses digital zoom only, which isn't really apparent from the title, resulting in blocky pics if you use that particular zoom function.  I haven't tapped even 10% of the capacity of this camera yet, so the rest of the features that I haven't explored yet will just be icing on the cake.  The ZS7 is an amazing amount of camera in such a small package.  This camera is now my best small camera, easily beating my Canon S3is, A590, and A40 (old) - the Pentax K-x is technically better, but way too bulky to pop into a pocket for a trip to the zoo or museum.

Also in some cases camera gets confused which lighting mode to use for indoor shots (incandescent light or other), and takes pictures with over-saturated yellow/orange color.  The next picture of the same scene may get the right color mode.Another camera flaw comes from large lenses diameter, which results in longer circumference of lens mechanism and a greater chance of sand and dust getting into the camera through lenses. After one year of using similar camera ZS3 I can clearly see dust particles under lenses glass.

PN-DMW-BCG10E 'DECODED' battery 3.7V 1000mAh works great. With firmware version 1.1 . The battery will set you back 7 skins if you shop around.Second - The build of this camera is SUPER excellent and buttons are well placed.  The first thing I did was to power up, set the camera to iA (intelligent Automatic mode) and shoot a picture of my coffee cup at 10 megapixel 16x9 format.  Depressing the shutter halfway performed a stable autofocus and the flash went off giving a great detailed picture.

Solution: 1) Just search for the necessary .msi file using Windows Search  2) navigate to the directory containing the asked for .msi file  hint: right mouse click ('open file location'),  3) select the file with the mouse and hit 'OK'.  4) Reboot your computer after installation is finished and update the software via the PhotoFun Studio application under the 'Help' menu. - Quicktime is also installed as an option for viewing motion JPEG files. AVC HD videos can also be viewed in the included PhotoFun Studio application. (the extension of the HD AVC videos is either mt2s or mts (will specify when I have shot some videos). Installation of Quicktime is better done by acquiring the latest version and installing manually.  Quicktime Pro (not free) allows editing and creation of videos.  I had to navigate to the installer on the Panasonic software disk because the launcher did not enable the installation of the Quicktime software for me.  In addition, the Quicktime software may be installed on top of a previous version of Quicktime that you have on your computer. This may be an issue for you.Provided Cables: - The camera comes with a proprietary USB cable for connecting the camera to your computer.  After plugging in the camera via this cable the device driver is immediately installed by Windows 7x64 bit OS. The camera also comes with a Component A/V cable for connection to devices supporting component type connections such as HDTV and flat screen monitors although connection via a mini HDMI to HDMI cable is preferred (see below).Optional Cable: - I also purchased a mini HDMI to HDMI cable for connection to my 1080p monitor/HDTV for about 6 clams - or mini HDMI to HDMI adaptor sold thru Amazon RiteAV - HDMI to Mini HDMI Type C Adapter - 8 inch (this is really not optional - increases quality of viewing on 1080p monitors for minimal cost)Connectivity and resulting image rendering: - Viewing images on my LG1080p HDTV/monitor (see 'Equipment List' below) was a total pleasure... Best: Image rendering was best by connecting to my HDTV with the optional mini HDMI to HDMI cable via a direct connection to my HDTV/monitor configured for 1080p 16:9 format. Excellent: Detail was rendered at HD 1080p resolution (upscaled by my Seagate Theatre+ media player to 1080p) 16:9 format and gave greater resolution than my laptop monitor [I could easily read the calories on a  can or 'Bumble Bee Tuna' from a picture taken in iA (intelligent Automatic mode) from 6ft @ 200iso 1/15th of a second exposure with flash] Very Good: Detail was very good when viewed on my laptop 1366x768 screen resolution (Intel Graphics, onboard vanilla flavor)  using IrfanView graphics application. (you can probably expect similiar results or better using other software and good video graphics hardware. Very Good: Detail was very good when connecting via VGA from laptop to VGA port on LG 1080p monitor configured for 1920x1080 resolution (Intel Graphics, onboard vanilla flavor)  ???:  Could not test. HDMI connection to HDTV/Monitor via HDMI [ my laptop does not have HDMI output :( ]  I suspect that the rendering of these images could be awesome. Good: Detail was good using my Seagate Theatre + Media Player set for 720p resolution (no upscaling...) Seagate FreeAgent Theater+1080P HD Media Player STCEA201-RK Acceptable: Detail was rendered good, but noticeably degraded by direct connection to my 1080p HDTV/monitor using the included HDMI to Component cable provided with the camera. (Not recommended for HD) Equipment list: Lumix SZ7 camera, Seagate Theatre+ Media Player (upscaling to 1080p), LG 22\" HDTV/1080p LCD Monitor or 32\" equivalent thru Amazon: LG 32LD450 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTV, Lenovo laptop 1366x768 resolution 15.6\" monitor w/Intel onboard graphics, mini HDMI to HDMI cable (see above under optional cable) or RiteAV - HDMI to Mini HDMI Type C Adapter - 8 inch, Component A/V cable (provided w/ camera), USB/PC cable (provided w/camera), Image Viewer Software (optional) I recommend IrfanView package [freeware, many good plugins, highly configureable, Exif aware, IPTC aware, GPS mapping via GoogleEarth, GeoHack-Wiki (access to many GPS mapping tools)]GPS: - GPS connectivity is set as off by default (saves on battery).  GPS of sample image pegged my address when viewed on Google Maps, Bing Maps, or GeoHack-Wiki.  The IrfanView software (freeware) is great for viewing EXIF data attached to JPEG images by the camera and can map the coordinates of the GPS information in GoogleEarth, and GeoHack-Wiki (access to GoogleEarth, Bing Maps and other GPS aware mapping tools).  The Lumix SZ7 pegged the image to my address but about 100 ft from the exact location.

It has the brain of Einstein.  When I saw the results and used the camera myself (never enjoyed picture taking) I rushed onto Amazon.com to order one in red for myself.  When the photos it takes were shown to friends and family they too were amazed and consequently had to buy one for themselves.  4 more cameras were purchasrd just by seeing the one my brother was given as a gift.  The secret to such quality photos must be in the Leica lens and the Auto Intelligence mode in this Panasonic Lumix camera!", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "I cannot think of a feature I'd want that this doesn't have", "Author": "John Huesman \"QPhysics\"", "ReviewID": "R3SG29MNRINA2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once my wife and I decided we wanted a new digital camera that would also take HD video, I spent (literally) weeks going over reviews, buyer's guides, manufacturer's web sites, and going to retail stores to see the cameras. No matter how I analyzed the results, only one camera kept coming out in the top 3 choices, and was number 1 in most categories: the Lumix ZS7. So we bought it and I couldn't be happier about that decision.What sets this camera apart from the others is the lens. I've posted some pictures that I took right after opening the box; it's hard to tell the difference between the picture of a (fake) flower taken from 4 inches and a picture of the same flower taken from across the room at full optical zoom. And the picture of the text on a printed paper was taken with the lens body actually sitting on the paper! If you need a camera that will take a closer picture with sharper, crisper details...I don't think you could find one at any price.Besides the iA setting, which is suitable for almost any purpose, there are a couple dozen specialty scene settings. The one I use most often is the panorama assist; take the first picture, and the camera shows you part of that image only moved to the opposite side of the screen...line that up now, and you're ready for shot number 2...repeat until you've taken the full angle panorama you want. This is soooooo much nicer than the \"I'll try to make sure I have a good object for reference and hope the computer software can do it\" approach I had to do with my older camera (I cannot tell you how much I wish I'd had this when I was in Italy doing panoramas in Pisa, Rome, and Florence). And if none of those are what you need, you can define your own settings on the exposure, f-stop, etc. and save them as a macro.The video is amazing. Any of the HD settings will take good video, so it's really up to the user to decide what matters more, higher resolution but less shooting time or lower (but still HD) resolution and more movie before you have to switch SD cards. I hook the camera up directly to my 1080p TV to watch the videos and they are truly incredible. I don't see any motion blur or pixelation, even in low light shooting (my daughter and I on a carousel at the county fair, for example).Photo lag is practically nonexistent (and it has a burst mode if you really need several pictures taken per second). I was taking pictures at an ocean-based attraction park in Orlando (I'm not sure if I can use trademarked names here, but you know where I mean) and I have pictures, not in burst mode, of a dolphin jumping out of the water, the dolphin at the top of its jump, the dolphin about half-way back into the water, and the splash...so four pictures in a little over a second.I don't use the GPS functionality often, but I have taken a couple pictures while hiking that were just too stunning a view not to be able to find it again, so turn on the GPS, imprint the location onto the photo, then turn the GPS back off to save the battery (it does seem to be quite the battery hog).The only less-than-perfect mark I can give this camera is that it uses a special battery instead of cheap, rechargeable AA's like my previous camera. But you can buy backup batteries either made by Panasonic (not cheap, or course) or 3rd-party like the ones in the kit I bought TheZipKit for PANASONIC BCG-10. Includes: 2 BCG-10 1200mAh Ultra High Capacity Batteries made with cells produced in JAPAN or USA, Table-Top Wire Tripod, 110/240 Mini Charger with fold out plug and a DC car adapter, SD/SDHC Card Reader, LCD Protection F...The LCD view screen is large, can show lots of information or get everything out of your way depending on the settings you choose. I like how it reads your SD card, computes, and shows you right on the LCD how many pictures or how many minutes of video you still have room for!The lens is so good I'm actually quite surprised to find it on a camera at this price.The camera has pretty much every function you'll ever need or want.Uses SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards, so you'll never run out of memory. (I have a 16GB SDHC card in mine and have never come close to filling it...that will hold a couple hundred pictures PLUS nearly 2 hours of video on the lower HD setting and still not be full! But I carry an 8GB card in the case just in case.)Even with the silly battery thing (I'd hate to not have the couple backups I bought because if your battery dies, you're out of luck for an hour at least, and that's if you have your charger with you and can find a place to plug it in...I really prefer AA batteries in portable devices) this camera gets a strong 5 out of 5.

I sold my tz5 on ebay not long ago, and would describe it as the most aggravating, frustrating camera EVER to use in low light. If you're a parent preparing to take lots of kid photos, which happens a lot at birthday parties and such, please make sure to try this camera out to make sure it fits your tastes before buying.  The zs7 is better than the tz5.  However, if you like to use full-auto mode, the camera prefers to choose indoor portrait mode, which ups the ISO and uses flash, and if the subject is more than, say, 3 feet away, you'll get day-glo kids.  Using P mode and choosing WB doesn't help much.  Even in its best pictures, it chose to make blue eyes greensish.The zs7 does have its good points - it takes great movies and its pictures are very sharp (unless you go up in ISO).  It's responsive and has a 12x zoom, way out from a high angle.  If you primarily shoot anything but people, this is a nice camera.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Point and Shoot, but the JPEG Compression is too high", "Author": "Paul Tinsley \"Tinz\"", "ReviewID": "R32VBKAR3EU8Y3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really wish they had provided the ability to tweak the JPEG Compression for this camera. Most of the features are flawless and it takes very decent pictures in strong lighting conditions. Of course, the images look awful close up, but the resolution is high enough to get large prints with considerable clarity. This camera would be unbeatable if they had provided a way to tweak the JPEG Compression. I can see that it compresses just a little too much, and I reckon that with the very large SDHC Cards around now, most users wouldn't mind larger files. I think they just evaluated the best trade-off between the most likely print size and the minimum file size necessary to deliver a decent image.The GPS is a great feature, but it is very unreliable. My wife drove to Denver and had the camera with the GPS mode on all of the time, even when the camera is off, and despite spending most of the day in Denver, the camera recorded a GPS location for our home for every photograph. The camera had been exposed to the sky for most of the day, so I have no idea why this happened and it's a bit of a letdown. When the GPS does work, its a great feature.Overall, we are very happy with this camera serving as a handy point-and-shoot. It doesn't replace our DSLR by any stretch, but it works out at a fairly good value for the price. The video is the best that I have seen for a camera of its size and has excellent motion stability, even at maximum zoom. The zoom is also phenomenal for the size of the camera and the wide angle sucks in vastly more picture than any other point-and-shoot that I have had before.I deducted 1 point for the GPS instability and the lack of more JPEG compression settings. Other than that, it's an amazing camera that will rarely let you down.Update 31st July, 2010:I have taken a lot of shots now in \"P\" mode with Sharpness at -1 and Noise Reduction at -2. This has greatly improved the image clarity, so I would now rate this camera at 4.5, losing only half a point for some GPS instability. There was a firmware update recently, and this seems to have made GPS better, but I can't be certain until I have tested a few other areas. If fixed, this camera is a definite 5 star buy!", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "F30 vs TZ10 - it's not all about the ISO", "Author": "S. J. Bennett", "ReviewID": "R2NNS0JKGCGM40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading enough camera reviews to make me go blind I jumped in and bought the Panasonnic TZ10. I already own the very excellent Fuji F30, and I wanted a camera that took equally good photos, as well as good quality HD video. Our 6 month old daughter is growing up just too fast, and I didn't want to film another minute of her at 640x480.Well it was all too obvious as soon as I started filming that this is one excellent camera for HD video. Good image quality, great image stabilisation, powerful zoom, and very good sound. The only video drawback is in low light, but it's probably just as good as an equally priced video camera (my assumption). It's also great having the option to use either AVCHD or Motion JPEG - AVCHD does have better sound though, and it practically doubles the recording time with no visible loss in video quality.The next challenge for me was to compare the photo quality with the F30, and after various un-scientific tests (I'm not a pro) I can safely conclude that they are very very similar. I mean the cameras themselves are very different, but the results are practically the same. My biggest fear was that the TZ10 wouldn't keep up with the F30 in low light, because this is where the F30 is well known for it's great performance.The fact is that the F30 actually does outperform the TZ10 in this category, HOWEVER the TZ10 makes up for lost ground with it's image stabilisation. Example: With no flash, the F30 took a great portrait of my wife in low light, with an ISO of 800 and a shutter speed of 1/60th of a second (any less than 1/50th is too blurry due to camera shake). The TZ10 took an equally good photo using ISO400 and a shutter speed of (get this) 1/6th of a second! And not the slightest bit blurry! Both photos were somewhat noisy at full zoom, but at regular 19\" screen-size both photos looked great, and almost identical to the eye.So all in all a great result. I have a new camera that rivals the F30 in photo quality, has the benefit of HD video, and for me a few other bonus benefits: Great long zoom, crystal clear hi-res screen, longer recording time on an SDHC or SDXC card (8gb = 1 hour)One last thing - I have to make mention of the Intelligent Auto mode, because it's just so great. I think trying to make a better shot using manual controls would be like trying to beat a computer at chess. It's almost never wrong so I just leave it on iA all the time. That is unless I'm photographing my baby, in which case I use the Baby scene mode.

Needless to say; not so for his SLR.2) Solid construction. It feels robust.  Metal body, no flexing parts.  Buttons are quite usuable, one dedicated for movie taking makes access to that feature easy. Powser switch is a slider - sensible and functional - reduces the likelehood of being pressed accidentally.3) Doubles as a video camera. As the light faded into the evening it proved to make quality movies even in poor light.  And captured the sounds quite well.4) Picture quality was noticably superior to the Nikon compact I was previously using.  And image stabilization helps in low light.  Similar to my Sony Alpha SLR in picture quality.  This is a marked step up for a compact.5)Three hours of intermittent assorted movie and photo taking did not even reduce the battery bar count by one.It was a great success in recording my son's event.It uses a large CCD (1/2.3\") and is more feature-rich than I will likely ever delve into.It comes with a compact charger wal-wart for the battery that is a nice feature.I had to use the software application that came with it to watch the videos, but have not done much research yet with AVCHD Lite.The GPS does not work indoors, I have not played with it yet; did not see it as a critical feature.

There are a lot of nice things about the ZS7.  Like many have mentioned, it sports a terrific range in a small form factor (25-300mm).  It offers complete manual, automatic, or anywhere in between shooting options.  There are a host of nice scene modes that are fun to experiment with ranging from common ones like beach, snow, candlelight to more artistic ones such as dynamic range and pinhole photography.  Just about every bell and whistle on the market, are on this camera and then some.For me, however, the bottom line is image quality.  Now you must have realistic expectations.  After all, this is a small point and shoot camera with a small sensor and there is no way it is a substitute for a dslr, or a micro 4/3 camera.  The trade off is you don't have to change (or pay for) expensive lenses, the camera is tiny and can go everywhere.  Basically your investment of time or money ends at the purchase price.  But I gave this camera 3 stars because I felt even within the peer group, the image quality is noticeably poor.  Noise is evident even at the lowest ISO setting of 80.  Because of this, the noise reduction within the camera is heavy and the details get smeared and hence, lost.  You can lower the noise reduction setting but you cannot shut it off.  And shooting Raw is not supported, so there is a limited ability to even work around this issue.Now, many people will not notice or care.

Caldwell \"LuvAlltech\"", "ReviewID": "R2URU24QH4D3P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS7 4 days ago, and I've been nothing but pleased and amazed with it.  I had read the reviews and watched multiple videos, and was frankly sold on getting the Fujifilm FinePix HS10, with it's 30X optical zoom and 1080p HD recording.  I hadn't considered anything else.  But I clicked on a banner ad for the DMC ZS7, liked what I saw, and researched further.  I ultimately chose it over the FujiFilm HS10, and don't regret it.Let's start with the DMC ZS7 zoom....it says right on the camera when you open the box \"16X Intelligent Zoom\".  That's  a combined 12X optical with a 4X digital.  The 30X optical zoom  was what drew me initially to the FujiFilm HS10.  But guess what I discovered about the Lumix DMC ZS7??  Something that many reviews, both professional and amateur, seemed to have missed??  The DMC ZS7 is capable of an astounding 63.8X extended zoom!!!  I discovered it in the vast array of submenus that are present on the camera.  The firmware is lightning fast, and navigating menus is quick and effortless, and the 4-directional keypad works well and feels solid under your fingers as you use it.  The camera is part plastic, part metal, and is heavy for a point and shoot, and I like that \"not cheap\" feeling.  But about the zoom.It's 12X optical plus 4X digital...so it says on the camera itself...and so many others have said...but after going through the array of submenus in the setup options, I found where you can turn on and extened digital zoom, an EXTRA 51.8X!!!  No lie.  Of course, it's grainy at best, and pixelized, but pics come out surprisingly well, and video, at the max range, are not as diluted as one might think.  For best quality, stick with 16X--that's covered by Panasonic's proprietary \"Intelligent Resolution\", which keeps things hella-sharp.  After that, yes, the pic and video quality degrade.  But still, the max 63.8X zoom is bearable, and is helpful in situations where you just have to get up close.  More expensive bridge megazoom cameras also get blurry and have focus issues as you max out the zoom.  I know, I have an Olympus SP 570UZ bridge camera that does that.  I can deal with it on a pocketable point and shoot!I just uploaded a wealth of videos on YouTube displaying the zoom capabilities of the DMC ZS7; I don't have the link as I'm writing this.  I'm going to try and upload some videos right here after I finish this review, and maybe find that link to the YouTube vids I posted.DO GET A FAST, SANDISK, CLASS 10  20 OR 30 Mbps SDHC card!!  It's what allows me to take video (by merely pressing one red dedicated \"record\" button) in 720p and brilliant, \"punchy\", 12 megapixel stills, with little to no delay between shots and recordings.  Anything less would be...uncivilized...LOL.  Seriously,  Amazon has great cards at reasonable prices, and I purchased an 8GB SanDisk Class10  30Mbps read/write Extreme card, and the choice is rewarding.  No long waits between shots & recording, no BS.I like the menus and indicators on the screen when you film.  As you zoom, the actual number zoomX is printed on the screen and increases as you go all the way to 63.8X(extended zoom \"on\").  Not just a zoom bar.  An icon shows what scene mode you're in, or what filter you're using  (I like the \"Film Grain\" black and white setting, which adds an Old World style class and charm to your stills AND  videos--yes, it works on videos, and the PinHole setting which makes you look through a virtual \"pinhole\" for that \"peeping\" effect) .  When you record, the square reticule flashes red,  a red dot above flashes, and there is an icon flashing with an arrow pointing to a memory card.  You definitely know you're recording!  No wondering.  Stills same thing, just green.  Every function you enact is clearly and visually displayed,  nothing cryptic.  Easy and bold and defined.  Always know EXACTLY your function, filter, etc.  Counts down recording seconds on screen, and time left on the card in seconds and minutes right on the screen.  There's TWO PAGES of scene modes and filters.  Multiple options for GPS (yes, there's a \"bump\" on the camera top that proudly displays the GPS logo).  If you're into geo-tagging your filming and using them in iPhoto on Mac, it's my understanding it works great with \"Faces\".  I have an Apple iMac 24\" with iPhoto '09, but I haven't tried the GPS feature on the DMC ZS7 yet.  It's well documented that it SEVERELY drains the included lithium battery (Amazon offers the exact replacement  at a good price---get the original with the \"PP\" designation or it won't fit).Quick note about importing to a Mac---When I tried to import my 1st  stills and vids, my 8GB Sandisk Class10 Extreme card did not import everything-even on multiple tries.  However, my Windows 7 HP laptop had NO problems EASILY importing ALL the content.  Can't explain that yet.  Not the card, otherwise why did it work on my Windows 7 laptop?The 720p HD recordings on the DMC ZS7 are OUTSTANDING.  I've seen test videos of the 1080p vids on the Fujifilm HS10 that can't hold a candle to what I get with the Lumix.  Panasonic's algorithms for resolution and clarity REALLY are a tour-de-force to be reckoned with, and ACTUALLY  WORK!!  Zooming is smooth and fast (slower on vids, I admit, but still good).  You have a \"zoom resume\" feature that allows you to cut the camera on from sleep mode, and start shooting with the exact zoom level you left off at.  The sound is recorded from 2 mics set on the camera's top, and provide sterling audio.  In options you can cut off the \"wind effect\"  so that the sensitive mics don't pick up wind noises that might obliterate the more important audio in your recordings.  You can control the LCD display brightness to 3 levels, and it is 460,000 pixels, not the standard 240,000, as the card attached to the camera says when you get it.  That's evident when you play back your HD movies.  I zoomed in on a float gliding across the pool,  and you can actually see the \"Inflate instructions\" and safety precautions printed on it.The exposure, one-touch recording button, and switch for playback and filming are located in the upper right corner on the back,  and CAN be hit accidentally.  I find  myself consciously always trying to avoid that, though I've never had any \"accidental\" recordings or stills taken.  But it is the only little nitpick I can think of on an otherwise \"Joy-to-use\",  \"easy-to-understand\",  PHENOMENAL  point & shoot  that is a pocketable, portable powerhouse.  Like a mini-DSLR in your pocket.  AMAZING performance (get the FAST card...).  Oh! Just thought of another nitpick.  There's  vertical light streaks present when you film DIRECTLY into a light source, such as the sun, oncoming nighttime headlights, etc.  But the lowlight capabilities on the DMC ZS7 are INCREDIBLE--zooming with little to no blur, and excellent clarity.  Okay, this has become a  Bible, and I've only had the camera 4 days.  I'll update when I discover anything new or significant.  These are my 1st impressions, and don't cover every technical aspect, so sorry.  Just wanted to convey the pleasure of owning and using what has now replaced my more expensive Megazoom as my camera of choice---\"What's the best Camera?  The one you have with you...\"I forgot only one review can be submitted for a product here, but I wanted you to see how to achieve the 63.8X zoom for this Lumix, so go to YouTube and type this into the SEARCH bar:  PANASONIC DMC-ZS7 INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET 63.8X ZOOM  Take you straight to my video & others as well. Enjoy.UPDATE Sept.8th 2010: It was my fault that my Sandisk 8GB Class10 Extreme card was not importing videos to my iMac.  In the \"Record Mode\" options, you have the choice of \"AVCHD Lite GPS\", \"AVCHD Lite\", or \"Motion JPEG\". I had the ZS7 set to \"AVCHD Lite\", which is not compatible with the iMac. When you try to import, you get executable files in the window & and it says the \"file format is not compatible\".  I'm assuming \"AVCHD Lite GPS\" would be no different, just with geo-tagging. So I tried \"Motion JPEG\". Took some test vids. Imported with no problems. It's interesting to note that not only are the videos imported, but also an iconic pic that represents the 1st frame of each video that is taken. The \"Motion JPEG\" setting allows for WVGA, QVGA, VGA, and HD.  I chose HD, which also shows up as a movie icon with the HD letters stamped on it when you're filming, so you know what record mode you're in, as well as the quality chosen.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Grover C.

The pictures turn out extremely clear and I mostly use the Intelligent Auto mode, which does a great job of determining the best settings for each place. I also use program mode, but have it set for 16:9 ratio for times when I want a landscape picture. The video is also extremely clear and the avchd makes very good quality videos. I've been trying to figure out how to edit the avchd in its native format, because when I import the video into iMovie it converts it into mov files, which degrade the video. So far I've just archived the avchd to my hard drive until I learn how to natively edit it.The GPS feature on the camera is a fun thing to play around with and in iPhoto I can see all the places I've taken photos at since I've got it, which have been all the way from Mexico to Lake Tahoe, CA. The GPS does seem to eat up the battery a little quicker than with it off, but it is definitely worth it for me. For those particular about battery life, but want the GPS info, there is an airplane mode in which the GPS only works when the camera is turned on, rather than even when it is off as it does in regular mode.I have not bought a case for it yet as I don't believe Panasonic makes one specifically for it and I haven't researched enough to find a perfectly fitting one. The only thing I regret is not buying a screen protector right away, because I ended up going on vacation the day after I got the camera and I didn't have much time to buy one. I would recommend everybody buy one asap. I noticed some minor scuffs on my lcd screen and this has been bugging me ever since. I've rubbed the screen with a lint free cloth numerous times to no avail. The camera fits easily in my pocket, though I keep a spare glasses case around it when I put it in my pocket (this has worked for the time being, the scuffs were because I put it in my pocket one time without the case).

The camera does everything it's supposed to do quite well. I've been pleased with many of the pictures I've taken, some of which would have been impossible to take without the wide and long telephoto lens. But all in all I've been somewhat disappointed with picture quality. Don't get me wrong. It's quite good. It's just that my expectations were unrealistically high. I now fully realize that no matter how good a camera's optics and many features are, a small sensor, such as the one in just about every compact camera, will never produce images as sharp as a DSLR with a much larger sensor, not that anybody said it would. Just wishful thinking on my part. So I'm beginning to look at this camera as a learning tool for my next camera which might be a four thirds format Panasonic, like the G2, or a full fledged DSLR. That kind of camera, however, will never be as small, light and convenient to use as the ZS7 is. It's definitely a keeper.In addition to the small sensor, there are a few other factors that may have limited picture sharpness so far. When you take pictures in the most fully automated (iA) mode, the camera tends to take them at a very high shutter speed and fairly large aperture setting. That limits what's in sharp focus - the depth of field. You have better control of that in one of the manual or scene modes but the camera's lens doesn't have a very small aperture so there's a limit to how much you can compensate. At the opposite end, there's not a very large aperture size that lets in a lot of natural light so many low light or indoor pictures either require using the flash, taking them at a slower speed and running the risk of the subject moving, or boosting the sensitivity (ISO) which tends to add a lot of noise or graininess above 400.There is one quirk I read about in a review before I bought the camera but didn't take seriously enough. When taking landscape photos, the color of the sky and the tone of the rest of a scene depends greatly on which direction you're pointing the camera and perhaps the angle of the sun. Take pictures in front of you and the sky may be brilliantly blue with white fluffy clouds but turn 90 degrees and the next picture you take may have a much grayer sky with clouds that are less distinguishable. The first picture may look like it was taken on a bright sunny day but the second picture, taken just seconds later under the same conditions, may look like it was taken on a more overcast day. I'm curious to know if others have had this same experience with the ZS7 or any other camera.Although the software on the enclosed DVD isn't compatible with my Macintosh computer, the PDF manual on that disk can easily be copied on to any computer, including the Mac. I've printed the 176 page document but I much prefer using the on-screen manual in the Mac's Preview application since I can increase the size of the type and illustrations and when I click on any of the numerous references to other pages I go directly there. But like most manuals these days, this one is too content oriented and not sufficiently geared to performing certain tasks and solving certain problems. A better manual, preferably an interactive DVD with video, would provide access to all the relevant information but do a better job enabling the user to meet all the challenges an amateur photographer is likely to face. I'd even pay extra for that if it were offered as an accessory assuming, of course, it worked on both Macs and PCs.My Canon has a fully articulating LCD which means I can easily take pictures with it from low or high angles or even surreptitiously from the side. Fortunately, the ZS7's large, bright LCD can be seen from many angles but at a certain point over your head, down by your knees or at an acute angle to the side, you lose sight of what you're about to shoot which is inevitable with this kind of camera. Maybe some day a slightly thicker, heavier point and shoot camera will come with an articulating LCD.Since I'm the kind of person who wants to take advantage of most of the camera's numerous features and capabilities, I'll need to spend a lot more time reading the manual, engaging in trial and error picture taking, and comparing the results of using different modes and settings in a variety of situations. If my assessment of the camera changes one way or the other after doing that, I'll modify my review accordingly.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sweeet", "Author": "Carlos M.

Guilmette \"ronbaby\"", "ReviewID": "R23X7LF7C5DRVO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hummm... where to begin.  I'm a very experienced amateur photographer.  My dad and I used to develop and print our own color film & prints in our basement darkroom, back 40 years ago when essentially zero amateurs even attempted this. I even worked for a short while (and got paid) as a photographer.  (But that also was a long time ago.)  Still, I know my way around a camera.I've owned several different film cameras in my life, but sold off the last one a few years ago because I could see the handwriting on the wall.  My first digital was an Olympus C-5000, which was nice, but only 5mp.  It had a couple of special features that I really miss.  I'll come back to those.  After that I got myself an Olympus SP-570UZ, in part because that is the ONLY model in the Olympus SP line that actually had a hotshoe for external flash.  I'll come back to that too.So anyway, recently I knew that I was going to be taking two trips, one of which was a rather challenging hike in Yosemite, so I decided to get myself something really compact and light.  Lucky for me I found not one by two big-zoom pocket compacts on sale as open box items in Amazon marketplace at ridiculous low prices.  (They have probably fired the guy who listed those by now, because really I got these both dirt cheap.)The first one I ordered was a Fuji Finepix F300EXR... basically last year's model, open box, at a knock down price.  This is another shirt-pocket big zoom compact (15x zoom, 12mp, 3.0\" LCD).  Then I saw the Lumix DMC-ZS7 (black)... also last year's model... on Amazon as a open box for an even more ridiculously low price, so I said \"what the hell\" and bought that one too, intended to return one of the other, depending on which one I liked best.  (I am a big fan of buying last year's model of anything and everything.  No matter what it is, this year's model is always overpriced, because all companies know that they can gouge the \"early adopters\".)So I got both and ran a few trivial picture quality comparisons and for both outdoor and indoor the DMC-ZS7 was quite clearly superior in terms of picture quality.  (I *did not* actually make any \"low light\" tests.  I feel obliged to mention that because the marketing materials for the Fuji assert that it gives markedly superior low-light performance.  I have not really checked this claim and thus can't say, one way or the other.)Both of these cameras are 12 megapixel models, but as I say, my own test shots, when displayed side-by-side on my monitor left no doubt.  Image quality was superior on the ZS7... perhaps not all that surprising of a result, given that the original MSRP at release was about a hundred bucks higher for the ZS7 versus the F300EXR.Size and weight of both cameras is essentially identical.  Both/either fit quite comfortably in a shirt pocket or a jeans pocket.  (Because these were my first ultra-compacts, I wasn't sure that would be true until I received them.)  Both are about the size of a pack of cigarettes, but a bit longer and only just barely thicker.  Both cameras have outer skins that are mostly metal, with some plastic trim here and there.  Both feel quite solid and build quality of both appears to my eye to be excellent.The F300EXR has slightly longer zoom (15x versus 12x) but given the choice, I'll take the better image quality over that extra zoom length.  Both cameras have nice 3.0 inch high-res LCDs, and both of those are sharp as a tack.  Both can take 720p high-res movies, and both have HDMI outputs.  (These were two features I really wanted.)  Both cameras come with essentially identical standard accessories, AV cable, USB cable, manual(s), software disks, and writs strap.  Both provide at least a modicum of manual controls... something else I definitely wanted... as well as shutter & aperture priority modes.Controls on both cameras are comfortable and, for the most part, intuitive.  The F300EXR has a kind of outer ring around the normative North/South/East/West/OK button set, and in playback and other contexts this is helpful.  The ZS7 doesn't have that, and to make matters worse the \"legend\", i.e. symbols indicating the function, that are on each of the North/South/East/West buttons pn the ZS7 are simply engraved into the tiny shiny metal buttons, making them very nearly impossible to even read in dim light (or actually impossible if I don't have my reading glasses on).The F300EXR power switch is push-down type, whereas on the ZS7 it is a slider switch.  (I prefer the latter.) On the F300EXR, the only way to playback is to power on (causing the lens to extend and the flash to pop up) and THEN press the playback button to switch to playback mode  This is clearly wasteful of time & battery power.  The ZS7 has a more sensible slider switch which can be set to either recording or playback mode BEFORE you slide the power switch to ON.As has been noted elsewhere, the F300EXR flash pops up and stays up whenever the power is on, and unfortunately, it is right win the spot where you are most likely to rest your left index finger. (You DO hold your cameras with both hands, right?)  By popping up, the F300EXR's flash maybe gets a tiny bit further from the lens (thus reducing red eye?) but I doubt this \"feature\" really buys you much.  The flash on the ZS7 is just there on the front of the camera.  No pop-up action.  Anyway, the pop-up flash on the F300EXR is not really annoying, just a bit surprising sometime when you power on and feel a little pushing up under your left index finger.On the ZS7, I noted that my left index finger sort-of naturally came to rest often on the upper left front corner of the camera.  That's not a problem until the camera wants to use the infrared thingy to help with auto-focus, at which point your'll note immediately that you need to move your left index finger slightly to get it out of the way of the infrared.The menu system of the F300EXR is quite good. It's clear, easy to read, dark-gray/light-gray superimposed over whatever would otherwise be displayed on the LCD at the moment.  The menu system of the ZS7, yellow-on-white, didn't seem quite as nice to me, but both/either will get the job done.  One major irritant with both of these that could easily be rectified by the manufacturers is a missing feature that I have on my Olympus SP-570UZ, i.e. built-in verbose help pages/screens within the menu system.  On the SP-570UZ, if you don't understand or are not sure about the function of some setting or another, you are just one tap away from a very helpful verbose English language description of the function of that setting.  It's almost like carrying a condensed/abridged version of the manual around with you, only better.  Why all digital cameras don't have this feature is beyond me.  It really doesn't take up much memory OR require much programming and even the simplest digital cameras nowadays are so complex and have so many features and functions that most have manuals that go on for more than 100 pages.  Are we supposed to MEMORIZE all that before sallying forth into the field to take pictures??  I think not.  So put it in the camera!  That way we can't lose it, like that bleedin' lens cap we haven't seen in the last five years.The super deluxe let-me-do-it-all-for-you point-and-shoot automatic-everything modes on both cameras produced generally excellent results in a variety of situations and conditions.  To my eye, auto-focus, auto-exposure, and auto white balance on both cameras pretty much always produced acceptable results, however as I've said, I am old-school, and where \"auto with aperture priority\" on small cameras such as these, where you can't really get thin depth of field no matter what you do (because the lenses are just too tiny), seem like an entirely useless/superfluous setting, I did feel the need to try auto with shutter priority on both cameras for various shots, just to keep the respective \"intelligent\" auto modes from mucking up the shot with excessively optimistic shutter speeds that wouldn't actually work in practice, especially handheld, towards the long ends of the zoom ranges.Battery life on both the F300EXR and the ZS7 was beyond excellent, and seemed to me to be well beyond what you would ever need for any one sitting OR even for an entire short vacation.  I mean who on earth takes 250+ shots in one sitting?  I'm an old-school guy who grew up on film cameras and who always had to worry about running out of film.  8GB SDHC cards are dirt cheap, so if you get one of those, then really, in the modern digital era, the only thing you ever really need to worry about running out of is battery power.  But as I say, with these cameras it seems like you don't even really need to worry about that much either.  I'm paranoid, so I bought an extra (cheaper than Panasonic) third-party spare battery for the ZS7, and now I feel like an idiot for having done so, because really, I doubt that I'll ever even use it.  I took about 100 shots on an all-day hike in Yosemite and I still had plenty of power left at the end of the day.  Today I did my 31+ minute test movie, and even that didn't move the needle on the battery charge indicator... a rather surprising result given that modern video compression is known to be rather CPU (and power) intensive.The two Olympus cameras I had before I bought these two shirt-pocket compacts were straightforward to get pictures and movies from, even when I was plugging them into my UNIX system.  Both cameras just acted like a USB drive, with a FAT filesystem and so forth, and both could be \"mounted\" as a drive on UNIX or even,,, yecch... Windoze.  I assumed that all digital cameras behaved this way nowadays, but I was disappointed to learn that the F300EXR doesn't work this way.  Instead, it speaks some protocol called PTP.  In order to get stuff directly off the camera (from FreeBSD) I was going to have to load some additional software and diddle several system settings.  Blecch. I never did.  Instead I just bought myself a cheapie SD/SDHC card reader.  Problem solved.  On the other hand, the ZS7 _does_ behave just like a USB drive, so I could just plug it in, mount it as a drive, and start pulling stuff off.  I like that.  It's simple.The ZS7 has three features that definitely set it apart from the Fuji F300EXR, i.e. GPS, stereo sound recording, and the ability to record movies with some modern flavor of data compression, specifically AVCHD.  Personally, I don't give a flying fig about the GPS.  It's been set to off since I got the camera.  (I _do_ already know what city I am in, thank you very much.)  If I can ever figure out how to get actual GPS _coordinates_ out of the ZS7, and not just city names, then I will think that the GPS might have some usefulness, e.g. for the unlikely day I am lost in the forest with a satellite phone and need to tell my rescuers where I am.  But as I have so far not seen any setting on the ZS7 that would give me raw GPS hours/minutes/seconds coordinates, I still don't see the GPS feature as being at all useful, even with the GPS picture-tagging feature. I mean hey!  If I have a shot of Half Dome, I think I can remember that I took in in Yosemite.  If I'm looking at a shot I took of the Eiffel Tower... well... umm... DUH!  GPS is obviously just one of those techno bells and whistles that camera designers add just because they can, cheaply, and because the guys in the marketing departments think that it sounds techno-cool.  There are at least half a dozen OTHER features that could be added to these kinds of cameras for one tenth the cost and that would actually help people to take better pictures, but those ones don't seem to make it into the designs for some reason.  (See rant below.)The ability to record stereo sound is likewise rather superfluous, in my opinion.  I mean seriously, you have two microscopic microphones and they are sitting about 1/2 inch from one another.  Do we really think that the left and right are going to hear anything significantly different from the other?  If you do, then I have a bridge to sell you.Lastly, the modern video compression and the AVCHD recording format actually were and are things that I really cared/care about and want/wanted. I just now did a 30+ minute 720p/30 test recording on the ZS7.  (Yes, apparently the ZS7 _does not_ have the seemingly arbitrary 29 point something minute per movie time limit that some other digital cameras I've read about have.)  Anyway, my little 31+ minute ZS7 720p/30fps test recording came out to just over 3.6GB on the SDHC card.  That seems to me to be not too shabby, but as this is the first and only digital camera I've ever owned that can record HD or even SD movies, I really have nothing to compare it against.  Oops!  Wait a minute!  I almost forgot the F300EXR!OK so I did a 720p/24fps test recording using the F300EXR.  I just shot for about 11 minutes.  The resulting (AVI aka \"motion JPEG\") file size came out to about 1.25GB.  So ummm... hummm... maybe the newer fancy schmancy compression of AVCHD ain't all that big of an advantage, filesize-wise, after all.  I mean if you ignore the fact that one camera (ZS7) was recording 30 frames per second and the other one (F300EXR) was only recording 24fps, then the file sizes divided by the length of the recordings actually seem to come out to a fairly comparable number for either camera (and/or either type of compression used), i.e somewhat over 1GB per ten minutes of 720p recording.  BUT WAIT!  We need to consider the relative quality of the recordings also. I'll discuss and compare that below.I should note also that for my two test movie recordings for the ZS7 and the F300EXR I had the cameras on a tripod, pointed in a fixed direction into my backyard, and there was no zooming.  Many ducks and Canada geese wandered in and out of the frame during the recording, but other than that, the subject matter was certainly highly redundant/compressible.  In short, if I had done these test recordings by just pointing the camera out of the side of a moving train, I think I could safely bet that the resulting video files would have been substantially bigger than these ones actually came out to be.Oh!  Did I mention that both the F300EXR and the ZS7 allow zooming during movies?  (On the ZS7 you don't hear the zooming at all on the recording, but on the F300EXR you do, but just a little.)As I alluded to above, both the ZS7 and the F300EXR can be connected to your big modern flat screen TV via a special HDMI cable.  Neither camera ships with one of these, but the cables can be had for a few bucks each off Amazon.  (Do I need to warn you to make sure you order the Right Kind for your specific camera?)The ZS7 shoots all movies resolutions, including 720p, at 30 frames per second.  The ZS7 gives a choice of recording in \"motion JPEG\" (AVI?) format, AVCHD format, or AVCHD format annotated with GPS info. The F300EXR shoots 720p only a 24 frames per second and will record only in motion JPEG (AVI) format. AVCHD definitely should, in theory at least, provide better and more modern compression and thus considerably smaller movie files.  But see below.My short 720p test recordings on the ZS7, when played back via my LG BD370 and Samsung 42 inch 720p plasma were OK, but not what I would call stunning as regards to clarity.  Close ups of a cat in the garden who wasn't moving all that much were, ummm, acceptable, but it appears to me that when some of the branches (and leaves) of my local oak tree were in the shot, and when the leaves were moving on account of a passing breeze, or when I was panning or zooming, the complexity of the images was pushing the outer envelope of the video compression and/or the recording bit rate.  The oak leaves definitely did not appear to me to be crystal clear.  If you are not too critical, the the ZS7 will do just fine at 720p/30/ACVHD for your cat, your kids, or your family barbecue, and will definitely produce results that are likely better than any standard-def videocam, if only just.I, for one, have never been a believer in the advantages of 1080 over 720 HD.  Unless you routinely sit two feet away from your big flat screen with one of those 8 1/2 x 11 Fresnel sheet magnifiers, you are really never going to notice any advantage of 1080 over 720.  For me, even my local stations, when viewed in 720p on my Samsung 720p plasma are sharp as a tack. 1080 HD is mostly just a marketing thing designed to separate consumers from their excess money.I mention all this only because I want you to know that if you are expecting \"broadcast quality\" 720p from either the ZS7 or the F300EXR you ARE going to be disappointed.  These pockatable cameras are just not going to give you the same clarity as a dedicated professional videocam costing 50 times as much.  But like I say, these cameras will still give you acceptable video of the family barbecue. (These kinds of higher-end pocket digital cameras are really the modern equivalent of the old family 8mm camera of bygone days... but actually a bit less sharp, I'm sad to report.)All that being said, the 720p/24fps recordings created by the F300EXR were definitely and obviously not in the same class as the 720p/30fps test recordings I did with the ZS7.  And no, I do not think that this was just a matter of the difference in the frame rate.  The test recordings from the ZS7 definitely appeared as if they had been shot with higher resolution, relative to the test recordings produced by the F300EXR.  But don't get too excited.  As I said above, neither of these cameras produces anything that could be mistaken for \"broadcast quality\" 720p.  Still, in comparable 720p recordings, the ZS7 produces unambiguously and noticeably sharper and clearer results, relative to the F300EXR.  (But I would be happy to take either camera, any day, and by a country mile, over any cellphone-cam.)Other points on video recording...The F300EXR apparently has a \"feature\" (aka bug) in the audio recording.  I noticed this when I did some test recording in my backyard.  Whenever the ducks and geese got really quiet and when the traffic noise from the nearby major arterial subsided, and when there were no planes overhead, in short when things got mostly quiet, the F300EXR apparently invoked some sort of demented auto level adjustment algorithm that causes the recording to go dead quiet, at least until the actual sound you are recording picks up a bit again.  On playback, these dead quiet periods were really noticeable, and seemed, well, odd.  The ZS7 has no such mis-feature.I really wanted the ACVHD recording feature of the ZS7 because I have both an older Panasonic Blu-Ray player (DMP-BD60) and also a medium old LG Blu-Ray player (BD370) that both claimed to be  able to play ACVHD, and I wanted to see if I could record some stuff in ACVHD format, burn it to a DVD, and then play it on one or both of these Blue-Ray players.  Well, I can now report that I _have_ been able to do exactly this.  I took two short 720p test recordings made in the ACVHD mode on the ZS7, used the software that came with the ZS7, copied the recordings to the hard drive on my Windoze7 system, and then used the software that came with the ZS7 to burn both recordings to a single DVD, and then popped that into my LG BD370, and it just worked, with even a little top-level menu that allowed me to select which of the two test recordings to play.  That's the good news.The bad news is that it was almost impossible to do all this because of at least a couple of really atrocious bugs in the Panasonic PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD software that came with the camera.  The worst of these bugs was that on Windows7, at least, critical buttons like \"next\" and \"back\" and \"ok\" and \"abort\" that appear at various points during interaction with the software *are not even readable*!!  I'm not kidding.  The titles that should appear on these buttons actually display as black characters on a black background!!  So I ended up having to look at the PDF of the camera manual, and at its screen shots of the software in operation, in order to deduce which of the several completely black buttons on the screen was actually the \"back\" button, which one was the \"next\" button, and so forth.  Without the camera's PDF manual and its screen shots, the PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD  software would have been totally un-navigable and thus totally useless, and I would not have been able to get my ACVHD recordings off the SDHC card OR subsequently burn them onto a DVD. In short, PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 HD is seriously broken.  I groped around for a long time on Panasonic's web site and eventually found a version 5.2, downloaded it and tried to install it and the install process failed with some utterly mysterious and entirely uninformative error message.  De-installing 5.1 before trying to install 5.2 made no difference.  (Panasonic needs to hire some monkeys to test their camera-external software.  Even a monkey could see that both PHOTOfunStudio 5.1 and PHOTOfunStudio 5.2 have critical flaws.)  At the time of this writing I don't even know yet whether I will be able to even reinstall the 5.1 version successfully or not.  At least I could get it to burn my ACVHD movies onto DVDs, albeit only while working around the unlabeled back/next/etc. buttons.  But I can't even get 5.2 to install!  Even stranger, Panasonic's web site talks about various 6.x versions of this same PHOTOfunStudio software, but I'll be bleeped if I can even find where they might be hiding those versions on their web server, let alone anything on the Panasonic web site that says what the differences might be between the different versions OR anything which lists which versions are compatible with which Lumix camera models.)(NOTE: The ONLY reason I am giving the ZS7 four rather than five stars is because of all of these unforgivable external software snafus.)Just a few final complaints about the Fuji F300EXR the ZS7, and probably every other pockatable digital camera currently on the market... (begin rant mode).Firstly, I know these things are already both tiny and packed to the rafters with internal guts, but seriously, how hard would it be for thje manufacturers to add a little optical or digital viewfinder, or alternatively, in the absence of that, to make and sell a reasonably priced thing that fits over the LCD, shades it, and provides a small lens with a diopter adjustment?  Despite the marketing hype, these LCDs are utterly useless in the presence of bright sun.  You just can't frame a shot with the sun behind you.  Just as importantly, it seems that everybody who designs these kinds of pocketable digitals is under the age of 45.  I say that because obviously, not a single one of them knows the first thing about presbyopia.  I am over 45, have presbyopia (like everybody else my age) and I can't be talking with my friends, ten feet in front of me, and then look down at the LCD on my camera, one foot in front of my face, and see it other than as a big blur, at least until I put my reading glasses back on, by which time I have missed the moment AND the shot.  This sucketh. I've seen shade thingies on sale that fit over 3 inch LCDs and have little diaopter adjustable lenses, and these would be perfect for people like me and our pocket cameras, but alas, these things are mostly sold to the DSLR crowd and thus cost and arm and a leg.  SOMEBODY should make and sell them for $19.95 (please?)  That would still yield a 10,000% profit over manufacturing cost.My (now ancient) Olympus C-5000 had a little optical viewfinder.  That proves that it can be done, and indeed, that technology is actually regressing in some ways.  the C-5000 had a viewfinder and that was 6+ years ago!  This new generation of pockatable cameras, unlike my C-5000 from 6 years ago, are (a) useless in bright sun and (b) semi-useless to the 99.9% of people over age 45 who need/use reading glasses.Another useful feature that my old C-5000 had that I seriously miss, and that I'm 100% sure would be dirt cheap to add to this current generation of pocket cameras was a tiny little infrared remote control.  2-second and 10-second delay timers just don't cut it if you want to get in the shot with all your pals AND have time to compose yourself and smile your best smile.  Also, I want to be able to set my camera on the other side of the garden and then fire it remotely from inside the house when and if I see some wildlife passing right in front of it.  Again, technology is regressing.  I had a remote control 6+ years ago.  Now I don't. :-(  Why?  They are cheap to make and the IR camera sensor already has to be there anyway, for the IR-based auto-focus assist.More absent features...It's too bad the designers of the current generation of pockatables are all boxed into the amateur \"snapshot\" mindset.  I guess that we should be grateful that they at least include tripod mounts on these cameras, even if only as an afterthought.  But come on!  If you are going to build a camera with a tripod mount, then it is almost idiotic that the user can't even tell the whole \"intelligent auto\" fly-by-wire almost-artificial-intelligence master brain/computer that \"Hey! We are tripod mounted now, so you, camera-brain, can automagically select slower shutter speeds and thus, correspondingly lower auto-computed ISO settings (for less noise).\"  In short, there should be a \"tripod mounted\" setting which will modify the settings selected by the \"intelligent auto\" system. (It doesn't count as \"intelligent\" if the camera doesn't know what even the stupidest human knows, i.e. that the camera is tripod mounted and thus more stable and jitter-free.)  In a similar/related vein, why can't these designers of pockatable cameras include some facility for plugging in the electronic equivalent of a good old fashioned shutter-release cable, you know, for when you are tripod mounted AND when you want to do shutter release without even touching... or jiggling... the camera?  I was able to buy a cheapie third-party \"electronic\" shutter-release thingy for my semi-old SP-570UZ and it worked like a charm and was dirt cheap.  It plugs into the SP570UZ's USB connector, so no extra precious camera surface area was needed in the design of this on the camera side.  This is SOOOOOO technically trivial, and yet so useful to anybody who really cares about getting a rock-solid non-blurred shot that it is a travesty for ANY digital camera not to have support for this kind of optional external accessory.  I mean it's like buying an expensive BMW and then looking down where the cigarette lighter should be and just seeing an empty hole.  Dumb.  Really dumb.More stuff I wish I could have...Connectors:  Now that these pockatable cameras are getting big zooms and other higher-end features, how about thinking outside of the box and providing just some cheap/easy but potentially extremely useful connectors, specifically (a) a good old fashioned flash \"sync cord\" socket and/or (b) a micro phone jack / TRS jack where an external stereo microphone could be plugged in?  Either of these would be technically trivial and dirt cheap to add, so how about it manufacturers?You manufacturers really don't have to worry about these extra features causing \"cannibalization\" of your higher-end (and more expensive) DSLR or super-zoom bridge camera lines for the simple reason that the markets for these things are just plain DIFFERENT MARKETS.  Anybody planning a trip deep into the amazon rain forest and who wants the best photos he can get IS going to buy a DSLR, no matter what nice little tweaks he can get on a pocket portable.  Conversely, anybody going into the jungle and who just wants some snapshots to take home is NOT going to spring for a DSLR or an expensive bridge camera... or be willing to carry the extra weight... just so he can get an external mic jack or an electronic shutter release.  Different markets.  'nuff said.Here endith the lesson.Other than the above nits, I actually love both the F300EXR and the ZS7.  They are both stunning and phenomenal pieces of engineering.  But of the two, the ZS7 is the one I will be keeping.P.S. One other small nit about digital cameras generally and the ZS7 and F300EXR specifically. All the digital cameras I've ever owned, including these two news ones are all apparently too stupid to even know which way is up.  Literally.  Can't you manufacturers fix this??  iPhones seem to always know which way is up, so why can't all digital cameras?(Like many of the comments above, the following comments are addressed to the camera manufacturers.)Look, this is very simple guys.  Every JPEG file has a built-in orientation and thus, a built in \"upper left\" corner.  So why is it that when I take my digital camera and orient it vertically, you know, as in \"portrait\" orientation versus \"landscape\" orientation, and then I take a shot and then load the JPEG onto my PeeCEE and then try and view the thing, the picture shows up on my screen lying on its side, rather than oriented properly?  This is definitely YOUR FAULT for not writing the JPEG file in way so that it will have proper (gravity based?) orientation.This is beyond stupid, particularly because I know for a fact that both the ZS7 and the F300EXR do in fact know which way is up, and they just aren't using that information properly.  I know they know which way is up, because in default factory settings on both, when I play back any JPEG that was shot \"portrait\" (vertical) it shows on the LCD in ``proper'' orientation, i.e. holding the camera normally (horizontal orientation) and then playing back a vertical-orientation shot, these cameras re-orient the images so that they appear on the LCDs vertically, and with big wide black bands on either side.  To accomplish this, obviously both cameras must be adding some sorts of annotations to all JPEGs they produce which indicate whether the shot was taken horizontally or vertically.  So the cameras do know which was is \"up\" for any given shot.  And they even save notes about that for each shot/JPEG.  Unfortunately, both cameras are too dumb to simply arrange for the JPEGs themselves to be oriented properly, based on which was is up and which way is down at the time the shot was taken.  That's dumb.  Really dumb.P.P.S.  Lowepro Ridge 30 cases fit either of the cameras described above perfectly.  DO NOT try to get a Ridge 20, based on the interior size specs and the exterior size specs for these cameras. First, you will have trouble finding a Ridge 20, because apparently, they don't make them anymore.  And as I learned, even if you get one, you will wish you hadn't, because they are so tight that it will be a chore getting either of these cameras in or out of the case.  Go with the Ridge 30, which is just slightly roomier, and thus perfect for either of these cameras.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Mac Users Be Advised", "Author": "Paul G.", "ReviewID": "R3FPGK4APLRAZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this is a fantastic camera.

It's fantastic for travel, and I take it mountaineering with me when my DSLR's weight is too prohibitive.The one warning I would give to potential buyers is that the AVCHD Lite format is NOT inherently Mac compatible (not yet, anyway)!  Your two options if you use a Mac are to shoot video in the JPG mode, or to buy software that will convert AVCHD Lite files to .mp4 or .mov files.

So I wanted a camera that compensated for my unsteady hand, did a lot of the work for me and performed well in a wide range of circumstances, particularly on the hiking trails of Arizona. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 I got for Christmas hits the mark on every count. For users like me, the measure is how often you find yourself saying, \"Geez, I took that!\" Thanks to its Leica lens and image stabilization, the images have been razor sharp, beautifully exposed both indoors and out and the GPS feature has worked very well on hikes. I was concerned about reviews that noted how taxing the GPS was because it remains on even when the camera is off. But studying the manual, I learned that if it's turned off while the camera is on, it does not sap power when the camera is turned off. I have had no problems so far with battery life. But keep in mind I'm an amateur, not a high end user shooting hundreds of shots on each outing. The camera does very well indoors even without flash. For active outdoor users, it's compact size is a great feature. It's easy to carry in a small case or in a pocket while hiking. And the pictures are spectacular. My 20-year-old son and I hiked to the top of Southern Arizona's Pusch Peak during the holidays. We perched the camera on a rock at the top and, using the delay feature, took what I treasure as the best picture ever taken of the two of us. I took one of him standing on a rock overlooking all of Tucson and was stunned at how beautifully it came out. None of this should impress experienced photographers.

It has 15x zoom and GPS tagging.  But in reviews of camera, you have to download the maps and store them on a SD card.  Also some professional reviewers of the Samsung said it has noisy photos at higher ISOs.  The Panasonic DMC-ZS7 is the same camera as the Leica V-LUX 20, but at a substantially lower price.  It has up to 16x in optical zoom and higher if you turn on digital zoom.  It has built in GPS and the maps are preloaded.  The GPS can only be turned on and off through the menu screen.  In the Samsung it has a separate switch which would be handy on the Panasonic.  The Panasonic GPS continues to draw power even when the camera is shut off.  So you have to think about it when you put it away.  I wish Panasonic had put a switch to turn on and off the GPS.The Panasonic has the Leica lens so the pictures are wonderful in clarity.  One feature I really like is the manual record/play switch.  Where you can stay in playback or in record as long as you want.  It also has a instant video red button that allows you to start recording video at a moment's notice, without changing and selector knobs on top of the camera.  There is a separate button for sending unwanted photos to the trash can with on screen confirmation.I have taken several photos and found the camera easy to handle.  I have used the GPS feature but the camera doesn't give me confirmation until playback that shows the city, state, and country on the photo record, but won't record it on a print unless you tell it to.  It has manuel capabilities in case you want to tinker with the exposure settings like shutter priority, and aperture priority, and of course full manuel.  If you want to have the camera fix red eye you have to change the menu in Program mode and the camera does a nice job.  It flashes once to allow the subject's pupil to close down before the main flash to take the picture.  Many other cameras use multiple flashes before the main flash.  Red eye is caused by the flash being too close to the lens, and reflects the blood in the eyes.If you are looking for a great camera with a very good lens the Panasonic DMC-ZS7 is hard to beat for a higher end pocket camera.", "Date": "December 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "RKR", "ReviewID": "R3REMBYM0M3ZDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used this camera for a trip to Europe.

I liked both cameras, but the Lumix remained in focus when I zoomed, while the Canon took some time to refocus.I purchased the ZS7 from Amazon and it works as promised.

My criteria were as follows:1. 720p or greater HD video recording2. Must be able to continuously record for at least 30mins3. Pocket-size (I didn't want a bulky digital camcorder or DSLR)4. Good still picture-taking qualities are a bonus (I didn't want a Flip video recorder)5. Reasonable price, <$200Here's how the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 satisfies my requirements:1. It records 720p HD video in two formats: AVCHD and Motion JPG2. The AVCHD format allows it to record 720p video indefinitely, given enough memory (on a 16GB SDHC card, the battery runs out at 1 hour 40 mins, while the card can support 2 hours of video)3. It's not a slim camera that you can easily slip into your jeans, but still a compact digital that feels good in your hand and doesn't require a separate camera bag.4. While it doesn't take the best pictures under low light conditions, it does quite well in all other settings. The 12x zoom is very nice.5. I paid $199.99 for this when it was on sale.

Anyway, on that trip I also tried the FH22 (pictures not sharp; touch screen was awful) and the ZR3 (pictures not sharp), both of which, as stated, were not as sharp as the LZ7. I wanted to stay with Panasonic because I think they're a good value. After those two cameras (and various prices) I figured I might as well go to the top of the line for point-and-shoots.This camera: It was a little more than I wanted to spend, but it was absolutely worth it. The only setting I changed was the sharpness (which is good at the factory setting of 0, but I raised to +2 for fun) and a couple other settings that were non picture related. You can customize just about every aspect of shooting your picture. Everything is pretty and already covered in the other reviews, so here's some of my notes:GPS: It does take about 30-60 seconds to find a signal if you haven't had one in a while. Also, while it has landmarks, it's not going to show you nearby restaurants or gas stations (or whatever) like a full GPS. It's pretty accurate on its coordinates and where the photo was taken. Also, if you're outdoors and take a few pictures with GPS, then go indoors and lose signal, it will still keep the last coordinate from outside unless you turn off the camera. For videos, AVCHD allows GPS coordinates to be embedded in the file. Outside of playback on camera, I have no idea how to extract coordinates from the video files.AVCHD: At full 720p, on an empty 2GB card, you can get about 15m 30s minutes of video. On the memory card, it makes a file structure so you can burn it directly to Blu-Ray, or you can just remove the .MTS files it creates if you just need the single file.Battery Life: Depending on your selection of GPS mode (I have mine set for GPS only when camera is on). My only test in this area is with video, I had it set to a lower setting (MotionJPEG, WVGA), 22mins of video and filled the card, deleted, and took more video and had 1/3 bars of battery left. Photos, I took about 200 in a row (testing) and it just dropped to 2/3 bars of battery.Size: In comparison to the LZ7 it's actually a little longer and heavier, but nothing to freak out about. For what it does, it's a great size. I will say originally I wanted an extra-slim camera but I didn't want to sacrifice picture quality or optical zoom.Dislikes:- Proprietary USB port/cable- Alleged blocking of 3rd party batteries by Panasonic (haven't needed a new battery, see other reviews)- Does not include photo software if you're a Mac user (personally, I didn't care).", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great features but does it have a flaw??", "Author": "rockmeister", "ReviewID": "R36XSXWB8WQ6A2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera primarily because of its great optical zoom range and built in GPS.

So I started the search for a replacement. If I was smart I would have just replaced it with another FZ series camera and be done with it. However, I wanted a camera that was smaller and still had the same features as my FZ5. After months of research and resizing that the 2010 field season was coming up I needed to make a decision. So I chose the Panasonic DMC-TZ10/ZS7, because of its small size and megazoom, Leica lens. Some of the reviews complained about the battery life, the GPS, and video features this camera provided. I however, did not care about the GPS and video functions since that's what the Trimble/Garmin are for. As for batteries, I always carry 2-3 extra batteries with me because when I am in the field I have no power sources for days on end. I basically wanted a camera that is small but still offered the megazoom feature and good image quality.In the beginning the camera worked flawlessly. After 2 months of ownership and being very careful with it then lens/focusing system failed. I would get an error and the lens would not focus or extend in and out of the camera body. I turned off the camera and removed/replaced the battery and the lens barrel still did not retract.Panasonic replaced the camera since it was under warranty.The replacement worked for only 1 month before it also failed in the exact same manner. Being Irate with the lens failure for a second time on the DMC-TZ10/ZS7 and then on another Panasonic camera the DMC-FH5 I am giving up on Panasonic's smaller camera. For the rest of the field season I had to use my personal Canon G11 which I absolutely love it just does not have the supper zoom feature.I am giving the DMC-TZ10/ZS7 a 3 star rating because of the poor workmanship and quality of the lens barrel. The Leica lens (glass) is fantastic as is the easy use of the camera and it's size.

A word of caution: you need to buy a mini-HDMI to HDMI for this camera. One drawback of this camera is that if you are shooting a video you cannot simultaneously take stills. There is a lag time between switching from the video mode to the still mode (a sliding switch). Contrary to some concerns about using the zoom while in video mode, I can report that I was very happy with the results.

The 12x zoom is very adequate for me - other camera's in this price category can go up to 18x but don't have as good a wide angle.  I personally would go with the wide angle rather than the extra \"zoom.\"  You might want the 18X if your primary usage would be shooting wildlife at a distance - particularly birds.  That said, the lack of a viewfinder makes this camera more difficult to use for birding - I find it hard to quickly \"find\" small wildlife on the LCD at maximum zoom.I miss my viewfinder on the Canon.  It had both the viewfinder and the view screen.  The Panasonic has a better 3 inch view screen, but no viewfinder.  I guess I'm old fashioned that way.  I'll get used to it (I hope).The Panasonic is much smaller - much easier to carry.  It's impressive that you have that they can fit that zoom into that small a camera.The Panasonic really goes through it's battery if you have the GPS active.  I personally don't think the GPS adds much.  It mostly identifies the city/state, but unless you are shooting at a major tourist site, it doesn't narrow the photo to the specific site.  You are going to get city/state and latitude/longitude.  I don't find that to be particularly useful.  I'll probably leave it turned off.  Sounds great, but I wouldn't make a purchase decision between cameras to get the GPS feature.The Canon used standard batteries.  That was great if you were traveling in Europe and didn't want to bother with power adapters for a battery charger.  I've had to charge the Panasonic batteries more often than I anticipated, even with GPS off.  You definitely will need to have an extra, charged battery on hand.The camera pauses after each shot to \"preview\" the last shot.  I turned that off in the menu, but I still get a slight, irritating pause.  (Perhaps I don't have the setting correct - but I think I do.)The menu system is intuitive.  I mostly use automatic and scene-panoramic stitch.  The stitch works well, it includes an overlay image that helps you line up multiple photos to stitch together.  It is hard to see the overlay image in bright light, but I do like that feature.  The burst mode works much better than the burst mode in my old Canon - the photos come out quite clear with good resolution.  I also tried the scene-underwater to shoot some small fish in a stream - I was very impressed with the results.One glitch on this camera is that if you rotate the camera to get a \"tall\" shot instead of a \"wide\" shot, the LCD is darker.  You'll need to take off your sunglasses to frame your photo.  Strange.The camera takes great photos - slightly better photos than my old Canon - which also took great photos.  Not so much better to justify buying a new camera (unless you break your old one :))I don't care much for the Panasonic software that's included.  For instance, I don't see a setting that allows you to automatically delete photos from the camera after download.  Also - my Canon and Nikon software have more functionality for viewing, quick editing and renaming.  I think I'll continue to use my old software unless I'm stitching.  As far as I can tell, the Canon software stitches the Panasonic photos just fine, so I may just continue to use the Canon software for all downloads.You will need to buy an extra battery ($30 or so), a camera case (a cheap one costs around $10 after shipping), and a plastic cover for the LCD screen ($5 or so), and a memory chip.  (The internal memory is much too small for any vacation.)I'm happy with the purchase - I paid around $280.This was a good buy.  I recommend the ZS7 for anyone who wants a good wide angle and good but not the best zoom, especially if you can get the camera for around $280 (or less).  If you have to pay the $350 suggested price, I would shop around.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "AZ Desert Rat \"movie buff\"", "ReviewID": "R2SSNU8KPI0HCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted this Camera for it's wide angle lens and zoom.

Highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great W I D E angle Hi Def Camcorder - er - Camera (Made in Japan too)", "Author": "B. Roy \"RoyTech\"", "ReviewID": "R3TL4G5CALI3MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a bagful of camera's by now and one of them is the earlier iteration to this camera - the  TZ-3. Did not quite like its color rendering and that camera itself has now stopped working (hangs after taking a couple of pics). I wasn't sure if I should buy its newer cousin but some of its features were in line with what I wanted. Turns out - Panasonic has made great strides in the intervening years. For one thing - color is vastly improved compared to earlier models.Now that I've used it for a while -1) Its truly a great shirt pocket size, wide angle, Hi Def camcorder. Dedicated HD camcorders don't come with a wide angle lens and all they let you capture at your kids b'day is the cake and two people on either side. With this camcorder - you can capture the crowd and when you play it back big screen, it looks spectacular with true colors and high resolution. With the huge resolution increase possible with HD video, you also need a wide angle lens to do it justice.2) It can zoom while taking video - all the way to 12X optical and to 16X with not much perceptible loss of resolution. The zoom is silent and does not grate into your sound (I don't note it). Focus is maintained rock steady through zooming. Zooming is slow, but that can be a good thing - most people zoom too much and fast in home video's - making home video's un-watchable.3) Someone mentioned two zooming speeds. Really? I see only one zooming speed. Not like a camcorder where zooming speed can be varied by pressing more or less on the zooming lever. Takes me about 10 seconds to go from 1 to 16X - so its a bit slow.4) Sound is good (stereo mike and dolby digital recording). Way way better than any other camera based sound I have used so far. The mikes are on top and prone to get blocked with my fingers now and then. Wish they were in front.5) There are 3 selectable bit rates - I use the highest one and later join and recompress the videos with the free DIVX converter to MKV. I don't note any stutter or jitter in my video's.6) With approx 12MB left in my card, the camera can take one and half hrs of video at highest bit rates, 2 hrs at medium and 3 hrs at the lowest setting. Thats plenty long. I use a class 4 card and works fine (AVCHD compression).7) Low light performance w/o zoom is also tolerable. If you also zoom in low light, too little light reaches the sensor for  decent images.  By low light - I mean a dimly lit room. With normal lighting, the video's look fine.8) Image stabilization is very good. I can even walk with the camera and take watchable video's.9) Face detection works when taking video's - perfectly exposed faces in a backlit environment.10) The batteries don't last very long when taking video's (haven't calculated how long). The batteries are electronically locked - so not any aftermarket spare will work. However - this one works fine (I just bought it) and the battery came fully charged -http://www.amazon.com/Power2000-Replacement-1200mAh-Lithium-Panasonic/dp/B002VJ1FDE/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1280437856&sr;=1-511) Way way better than a Flip HD camcorder in every way. I am really puzzled why people buy Flips anymore.Other notes -1) Shape and size are perfect. You really want a rectangular box and not some crazy rounded shape like some of the Canon's (like SD 940 - which  I own). Box is the only shape that will stand stable on its edge when you are trying to take a self timer shot. Fits fine in a shirtpocket with a cloth case on it.2) Low light with zoom can make for really noisy pics (visible when you see them at 100%). (I mostly use my SLR for \"in-home\" pics)3) Lens is really sharp. I can note the diff with SD940 (Canon).4) Color is good.5) GPS is essential and works well. Only way to remember where pics were taken 10 years from now. I leave it on at all times.6) Made in Japan (not China)7)Does not have a standard USB port - so you need to keep the special cable handy. Its not as big a con anymore since I rarely connect a camera to a computer.8) Panasonic does give you firmware updates to improve the performance of the camera after you've bought it. I just updated mine from 1.0 to 1.1.9) The viewing screen is very good , antireflective coated and visible in bright sunlight.10) Flash pics are much better exposed than my Canon SD94011) I hope it lasts - unlike my TZ-3.12) Ergonomics, button arrangement and screen information is excellent. Nice metal throught I used to not like the one press video function, but with a kid in the house, I think its the way to go.

So far as I can tell, none of the competition has anything like as fast, (read: useful) feature. This is huge. You have them say \"cheese\" and squeeze off six pictures in the high-speed mode.  One of them is bound to be good. Brute force brought to home photography.  Take this camera to your kid's little league game and squeeze the shutter when he bats.  At the end of the game you will have one or two \"once in a lifetime\" photos that would usually take an entire season of little league photography to match.  As far as I can tell, the pictures are better than competing Fujifilm model, not as good as competing Canon (P90).  Lumix is $[...] bucks or so cheaper than either.A few \"Musts\"1.  Buy the extra battery.  I don't know if they really have this anti-competitive software program that rigs the camera to not work with certain batteries, or not.  I do know that a spare battery can be bought cheaply with the original camera.  You can easily burn through a battery (rechargeable) through a day of hard shooting.2.  Turn off the fake shutter noise. Never turn it back on. Your subjects will be about 10X more tolerant of your \"burst\" picture taking without the noise.3.  Get a decent, high capacity, fast card.  I got a 133X Lexar 16GB for about $65. SanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-016G-P31, Retail Packaging) - NEW 30MB/s version If its not a high speed card, it can't use the burst function very well. (although I think my 133X card was probably overkill). This is a little tricky.  The industry standard is to rate cards by class, with class 10 being the highest.  Oddly, Sandisk, one of the biggest manufacturers prefers to market their high speed disks as \"133X\" I suppose to avoid a licensing fee for use of the term \"Class 10\"  So you have to search for both 133X and Class 6 or Class 10 to see what is available.The camera has an array of preset settings. Some are actually useful. I like \"happy\" (Kodachrome-like color saturation) and \"soft-skin\" portrait which really does give you good portraits.  The \"transform\" feature makes you look thinner!  It has two settings: Subtly slimming and \"fun-house mirror\"The wide-angle 25 mm equivalent lens is way more useful than a telephoto in real life.The good people at Square Trade after-market warranty say that the Panasonics are definitely more reliable than the point-and-shoot competition, which is like being the one-eyed man in the land of the blind. It does seem pretty sturdy, though.The bad:  Yeah, the flash is a little weak.  I am having some trouble programming the \"custom\" settings to take good pictures.  Not all features are combinable into one custom setting, so far as I can tell.  Just some.  The GPS is kinda stupid.  I understand the S57 doesn't have it.  I don't like the price, although its highly competitve in its class.  All in, its over $[...] bucks.  I can't get over that for a point and shoot camera.  At the same time, the longer I own this camera the more I think it was a good deal.Overall: Perfect camera for a young, active family, and travelers.

I get a new one every 18-24 months. I've always bought compact or ultra-compact.  Owned Canon, Panasonic, and Olympus. I've always researched my purchases extensively. Done test shot comparisons and balanced pixel level analysis with overall features, ergonomics, and ease of use. The ZS7 is still the all around best compact long zoom out there, for my needs.  Here's a breakdown what I like about it and why I didn't buy some of the other popular latest models:1) Image Quality: Excellent white balance, color accuracy, and most importantly best balance between noise reduction and detail preservation.  All newer models of this camera gradually went downhill as far as increasing noise reduction while decreasing preservation of detail.  If you do post-editing noise removal, you can always 'backout' if you do too much.  But this is not possible if the camera is already doing too much (for your preference) in-camera.  Post-processing noise reduction is only needed on this camera starting at ISO 400 or 800 depending on your print size.2) Easy to use with flexibility for different user types.  Fairly quick start-up and focusing.  Casual users can put it in iA (Intelligent Auto) and not mess with settings and it takes great photos in a variety of situations.  Tons of flexibility for Advanced Users with Aperture/Shutter Speed/and ISO priority available.3) Indoor Flash: Doesn't have the annoying pop-up flash yet still takes good, well-exposed/balanced indoor flash photos.4) Good ergonomics5) Video: Although it's 720P and not 1080, 720 is more than adequate for home movies.  1080 is only really beneficial if you are trying to take video for a semi-professional application where video will be displayed via projector or large screen (IMHO).  More importantly, you can zoom while taking video and it focuses well while you do it and you don't hear the zoom motor in the video like you do on so many other cameras.This camera would be perfect if it had a) a faster burst mode, b) high-speed/slo-mo video, and c) HDR (I think HDR is the best new feature to come along in the past few years by far)I've actually bought two of these.  The first I bought 6 mos. ago after researching all latest models, but lost it on a trip.  I re-did all my research of all the latest cameras just now and still went with another ZS7.  Here's why:Canon SX230 - This is the closest runner up.  About the same image quality (good detail but a little more lens distortion), easy to use and takes reliably good shots.  Dealbreaker on this one was only 28mm wide and pop-up flash.  If you don't want super wide lens, and are okay with awkward pop-up flash, this is the only camera I would choose currently over the ZS7.  I think most average users would be better off with the smaller Elph 310 without the pop-up flash which has excellent image quality for the size of the camera.Nikon Coolpix 8100/9100 - These Nikons are prone to problems/mechanical failures (see reviews).  Nikon enthusiasts have not been happy with them.  Not willing to take the chance on them.Sony HX7V/HX9V - Dealbreaker for me on these is too much noise reduction (softer photos) and slow operation.  Otherwise this is a VERY good camera all around.  I wish I had the HDR this camera has on the ZS7.  Sony's are expensive though and I've found in the past even with faster cameras, that I miss shots and video opportunities sometimes waiting for the camera to start up or switch modes.  The slowness is the Achilles heel of this camera.  And those picky about image quality will not like the aggressive noise reduction.  This would be my runner up to the SX230 though and if you can get past the slowness and higher price, this may be the best choice for the casual point-and-shoot user that wants a powerful camera with lots of features and good low light without flash performance.  I would have gone with an HX9V if it was faster with a little less noise reduction, this would easily be the hands down winner for me.It ceases to amaze me that it is so difficult for manufacturers to actually make real improvements to cameras in subsequent models in the area of image quality, ergonomics, and reliability.  Instead they just keep packing on sensors with more megapixels that offer no image quality improvement or even introduce more noise, only for marketing purposes.  GPS to me is gimmick and just an extra drain on the battery (I turn it off on the ZS7.)

The ZS7 is everything I had hoped it to be and more. It's small and fits nicely into shirt & pant pockets, has mostly metal quality construction and feels solid; the zoom feature is great, smooth and quiet and works in movie mode but more than anything, IT TAKES GREAT QUALITY PICTURES IN AUTO MODE and very nice 720P movies. Funny, I almost didn't purchase this camera because a lot of reviewers on this and other sites say it \"takes good pictures.\" I don't know what people expect from this camera but either the word Good has to be redefined by Webster's Dictionary people or camera reviewers are the harshest on the planet. To me \"good means average, this camera takes EXCELLENT pictures in daylight/sunlight conditions and very decent pictures in low light. The colors are very natural on auto default settings. There is a scene mode for warmer colors though if you want them. Focusing is fast and accurate and stabilization is excellent. At the price point I purchased this camera at, it was a steal.  Folks, this is not a $2500.00 SLR. This is a quality built point and shoot camera that is meant to be sold for a few hundred dollars. For the money, this is an excellent performing product.Full manual mode is available and if you have the desire to be creative you can be but just don't blame the camera if you don't get the settings right.  I use manual mode but mostly rely on the Auto Mode. The back screen is very easy on the eyes with its high pixel count, though I suspect very bright sunshine might or could be an issue. The menus are intuitive. And, I have to admit .... I haven't read the \"how to use\" guide for the camera as I just took it out of the box and started shooting! Regarding battery life: no problems with short life so far but purchased an extra battery anyway. Better safe than sorry.In closing, I should mention that my previous \"point & shoots\" were all \"top rated for picture taking\" Canons. In my eyes, there is no comparison.

That is, the larger camera has to be unpacked and packed again while hiking, biking or boating which often prevents or deters the taking of pictures on these outings.  Add a pair binoculars and these two items can weight down a pack otherwise loaded with water bottles and other trail items.  The little Panasonic can be comfortably worn on the belt or lashed to one's backpack (little carry bag not included) or even simply carried in your jacket or pant pocket. Very nice.  Now I'm more likely to take pictures while on the trail.  The larger camera may take better pics, but what's the point if its a hassle?

G9 can produce better color, while the ZS7 color may be off (especially blue) a bit but acceptable. G9 is not as sharp as ZS7, this may be the sharpening applied is more on the latter. This is an advantage to me.Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera, and I would ask anyone to consider Panasonic brand, because they are really pushing to be the number one in this DC competition.

Then it broke down, and I replaced it with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 about 6 weeks ago.The ZS7 has no manual focusing, no optical viewfinder, a fixed LCD screen, and a proprietary battery. Its small size makes it more portable but harder to hold than the A95. But none of these are deal-breakers, and in every other respect, it's light years ahead of my old camera. The autofocus works beautifully and can be manipulated to some degree; the fast-reacting \"live view\" LCD screen works as a highly accurate viewfinder; the LCD is bright, detailed, and 3x the size of the old one; and I bought 2 spare batteries. A compact camera is by definition a trade-off between portability and ergonomics, as human hands aren't going to get any smaller.The ZS7 is a type of point-and-shoot camera known as a travel zoom, which is an especially versatile category. Here are the features I found most useful:* Compactness: This thing can fit in a shirt pocket! It's taking some practice to make sure I hold it where my fingers won't obstruct the flash or sensors, or accidentally press any buttons. I'll figure it out. By the way, the extraordinary zoom range makes it about 1/4 inch thicker than many less capable compact cameras.* Responsiveness: Quick to start up and be ready for use; easy to switch modes and make adjustments; and most important, a short shutter lag (the delay between pressing the button and capturing the image).* Display quality: The 3 inch \"live view\" LCD is better than most in sunlight, automatically adjusts for different ambient lighting conditions, and can be viewed from almost any angle.* Lens adjustment: It zooms optically from an exceptional 25mm wide angle (great for interiors) to a 300-600mm (depending on mode) telephoto equivalent. Note - these aren't literal focal length numbers; they're equivalent to what they would be if this were a standard 35mm film camera. Most manufacturers express them this way so you can compare apples to apples.* Image quality: The lens is made by Leica, a legendarily high quality and expensive name in photography. The reviews I've read, and my own experience so far, concur that the image quality is very good. It also has image stabilization to compensate for my shaky hands.* Automatic mode: The ZS7 has a mode called Intelligent Automatic, which is an understatement. It does absolutely everything for you (except turn it on, zoom, press the shutter button and wind the cat) without any manual interference. It senses people, scenery, sunsets, closeups, and motion, and changes multiple settings to produce the best results. Many of the online reviews I've read say that they often got better photos on full automatic than by trying to make their own settings. That's confidence-inspiring.* Image size: 12 megapixels vs. 5mp on my previous camera. However, don't let megapixels be a basis for your buying decision; these days you'd be hard pressed to find a digital camera without sufficient resolution. Actually, 5mp is enough for all but the most demanding photographers. I set the ZS7 to take 5mp photos by default; it enables the camera to respond faster and record more images, and it almost doubles the optical zoom range (a Panasonic feature). And the 12mp setting is still there as an option, especially for larger prints.* Built-in GPS! It notes the name and coordinates of the place where the picture was taken, notes the nearest landmark, and adjusts the time zone if necessary. One quibble: when the GPS is turned on, the battery drains more quickly. That's understandable, if disappointing, but you can choose between three GPS modes: The On mode updates your location and drains the battery a bit even when the camera is off; the Flight or Airplane mode turns the GPS off when the camera is off, and the Off mode is completely off.* There are 28 different specialized scene modes; some of the more unusual ones are Soft Skin, Transform (stretch), Self Portrait, Panorama Assist, Food, Candlelight, Hi-Speed Burst, Aerial Photo, Pin Hole, Film Grain, High Dynamic (maximizes detail) and Underwater.* There are several macro modes, a face detection and recognition feature, and up to an hour of continuous video recording (on an 8GB card).Criticisms:* Reds can sometimes appear slightly orange.* The ZS7 tends to produce washed out highlights in contrasty scenes, so I like to compensate by underexposing a bit to maintain highlight detail.* I can't apply exposure compensation in the Intelligent Auto mode, although the setting applies globally in most other modes. So IA mode tends to overexpose.* I still accidentally press the movie record button sometimes; I showed the camera to a friend, and she did it too.* The camera is just a bit too thick for many compact cases. I found one, though.* The USB cable for PC connection has a proprietary plug at the camera end, so it won't be convenient to replace. You can buy a separate flash card reader as an alternative.I've barely scratched the surface of this camera's capabilities, and I'm still discovering new ones. So far, though, I've found little to criticize and much to appreciate. The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 is a great camera for anyone who wants to take all types of travel pictures and movies with built-in calendar management, GPS information, and automatic time zone adjustment. You'll also be pampered with almost foolproof automation and excellent image quality, and you can develop more sophisticated photography skills at your own pace with manual, shutter priority and aperture priority modes.=== Sept. 10, 2011 - UpdateSome good things about this camera came to light as I used it, and some not so good:+ The camera's Leica lens has incredibly low distortion and flare, even at the widest angle and aperture. It's a pleasure to use.+ The ZS7 produces very little purple fringing (usually visible along the edges of objects against bright backgrounds). I've read that this is due to a special processing algorithm built into the camera.+ Photos generally have very low noise (speckles in darker areas). It's a good thing because I tend to underexpose, which can exacerbate noise.- Panasonic's noise reduction algorithm tends to smear or smudge individual pixels, which can look bad when enlarged a lot. You can combat this effect by turning down the noise reduction, using the highest (12mp) image size setting, and/or turning off the Intelligent Resolution feature. It's a tradeoff.- Sometimes I wish I could focus manually, such as when shooting a Little League game through a chain-link fence. I also wish I could conveniently attach a polarizing filter. I also miss having a viewfinder where the image fills my field of vision.I'm still a big fan of this camera.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value in a Small Package", "Author": "Knock", "ReviewID": "RL1KOGBAL0Y33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first i couldn't believe it when friends and photo staff started recommending that i look at a Panasonic camera.

I waited patiently for digital cameras to get out of the 'novelty' bracket before I bought and the $3000 Nikon I bought no longer was cutting it when compared to my friend's work so I started looking for a replacement several months ago.It was an interesting experience.  The web has become everything I expected of it back in the 1990s.  It gave me a wide range of input on quality, price, usability, performance and more.

I found the performance/price ratio to be particularly appealing, especially when the camera's price started its downward drift common to many hi tech products after they have been on the market for awhile.The size causes me a few minor problems but the big issue for me is that I like a view-finder, especially in strong sunlight.

Excellent build quality (much better than my old canon), super sharp lens, full customizable setting, great video performance.Pro :1. Excellent build quality. Metal casing from body to battery door. My old Canon SD800 battery door made from plastic.2. Super sharp lens. tested indoor with maximum zoom level, I was able to get very sharp pictures. Just like pic that came from my canon dslr lens.3. Despite for its limitation, I can set the camera to perform up to my standard. for example, I can set the isomax to 400, therefore I can eliminate the noise issue in low light condition. And many more custom setting to choose from. Of course I still need sturdy hand or use tripod/monopod in this situation.4. Great coverage both wide end and tele zoom. 12x zoom is equal to 300mm lens on DSLR. what a great reach for such small camera!5. Excellent image quality & smart camera. I don't have to decide whether I want to shoot macro, landscape or portrait. the camera can adjust itself depending on your situation. very smart!6. Cool video reproduction w/ stereo sound. Panasonic seems to think outside the box how to overcome the camera limitation. The zoom function for example will move slow during video recording. This allow us to get smoother movement and reduce zoom motor noise. Continuous AF also supported. You can get similar result like the one recorded with camcorder. Worry about the AVCHD lite format? Good news is you can change the video format to motion JPEG which widely used by all video editing software including windows movie maker. For me, I like AVCHD better since I can take full video movie features that this camera promise.7. GPS functionality. automatically tag the photo & videos by detecting point of interest location from around the world. Just make sure you turn off this GPS features if you don't needed as it will drain your battery even when your camera in off position.8. excellent 11 points AF tracking & continuous tracking. This camera also can remember your face (up to 6 faces) and prioritize the focus on these faces.9. Manual depth of field control. Whether you want blur background or sharp landscape shot, everything that you could possibly dream of from DSLR, you can have it in here.10. Various scene selection. some of my favorites: pin hole (vignetting effect), High dynamic (HDR).  Update: Just found other cool things. Some of the scene selections can be applied toward video as well. For example you  can have vignetting effect with desaturated color when recording movies. This is very cool!Cons:1. No manual video control. I wish it has manual aperture control during video recording like LX-5.2. small aperture. If the camera  has larger aperture like f/2.8, it will have better result in lowlight shot.3. Light streak during video recording. Exposing to bright light, the video can produce light streak during recording. This is not the camera fault. It is CCD sensor issue that applied to any camera using the same sensor. Some new camera used backlit MOS sensor to overcome this issue but there is a trade in effect which reduce still shot image quality compare to CCD sensor.

Ritchey", "ReviewID": "REZW12BOSJIYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my DMC-ZS7 almost a year ago, and have subsequently taken thousands of pictures throughout my world travels - Hawaii, Africa, Europe.My favorite features:GPS - My Panasonic has helped me to remember where each picture was taken with the ingenious GPS function.  The GPS isn't perfect, and does sometimes take a few minutes to upload the new location, especially when you've changed countries, but it makes categorizing pictures so much easier. After a Christmas cruise that featured multiple port calls, I could easily sort my pictures from a cruise by destination, and the GPS tag reminded me of the names of several of the archaelogical sites I'd photographed while listening to the tour guide.  It was much nicer to upload my pictures to Facebook with captions that were informative rather than being left with \"this is some place in Greece, but I forget what it was called.\"Zoom - The 12x Zoom was the second biggest selling feature for me on the camera. I don't want to carry around a full size camera complete with long distance lens, but I like to be able to zoom in to capture details, and this camera seems to offer the best of both worlds. I get a lightweight purse friendly camera that can zoom in for some incredible shots, and the camera is smart enough in the IA function to compensate for zooming in and getting the macro details even on zoom. I've captured photos of butterflies and birds that you would never guess I was twenty feet away and shooting with a point and shoot camera.HD Video - The ability to shoot quality video with the camera allowed me to retire my old video camera, and subsequently cleared out additional space in my go to travel bag - Overland Equipment Special Edition Donner Bag.  With a 16GB SD card, I've never run out of space even while shooting video, high definition shots and shooting for multiple days.  Unlike some other cameras that I tried, the DMC-ZS7 allows you to use the zoom while shooting video.Baby/Pet Function - You can 'teach' your camera to recognize your children or pets, and it will then tag each photo with information about how old your child is in the photo! Makes putting together a baby book that much easier.Scenes - I love the preset scenes to select from, especially the Film Grain and High Dynamic.  With a quick flick of the top dial, you can transition from black and white, to color saturated shots, to normal photographs. I've found the rapid change ability between the scenes allows me to capture the same photographs in multiple different exposures. Very rarely do you find yourself \"stuck\" with a black and white picture that you wish could have been in color because it is so easy to switch back and forth. I am a photography junky, but have never taken a class, so don't really know much about apertures/exposures/etc, so I really enjoy that the various functions take so much of the guess work out of my hands. My sister has top of the line amateur equipment, and I think my pictures from our Christmas travels turned out fairly comparable, and she lugged around a lot more equipment and spent a lot more time fiddling with her camera in between shots.  For a handy travel camera, I think the Lumix is pretty keen.Image Quality - I've printed out photos up to 8x10 from my DMC-ZS7, and have been thrilled with the quality.If you're looking for a good, smart camera for travels or for documenting your family events, I don't think you can go wrong with the Lumix DMC-ZS7.  Are there cameras out there that will take better quality pictures - probably, especially if you get DSLR camera. However, I've always found that the better pictures are the ones you actually take, and the portability of this camera means that more often than not I have my camera with me and am able to get great pictures at times when I wasn't planning on taking pictures. If you opt for a larger DSLR camera, you are less likely to always carry it with you and find yourself in more of those \"Man, I wish I had my camera\" moments, while I'll be snapping away with my trusty Lumix.Happy snapping!PS - I would very highly recommend the Digital Matrex Lumix POWER KIT as an additional purchase when you get your camera.

The zoom worked wonderful and I was still able to get crisp shots.  Inside however, the pictures were blurry and poor quality.  After having many discussions with photographers, I think the poor indoor quality was due to me not having patience to learn how to adjust the camera.  With three small kids, I just didn't have the time to spend on learning the camera.  I wrongly then went to the Panasonic G1.  Wow!  This was complex.  I called panasonic to work me through the camera, which got me no where.  Sent it back.  Then went on to the  Fujifilm FinePix S2500HD 12MP Digital Camera with 18x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom.  This by far was the worst of all three.  All pictures were blurry and orange.

Needless to say, the options were almost unlimited.  After reading hundreds of reviews on dozens of cameras, I selected the ZS7.  Wow, what quality for the price!  I am very impressed.  The controls on the camera are easy to use.  The menu selection and layout allows quick changes and adjustments to almost any sort of situation.I do have several suggestions, however: when you order the camera, go ahead and order a second battery.  If you use the video feature a lot, you'll run out of juice fast.  In addition, I like having my camera with me most of the time, in the event I have a need to take a pic.  There's nothing more frustrating than running out of battery power at a critical time.  Having a second battery will help.The second suggestion is to order a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, so that you can connect the camera to your HDTV.  If you are traveling, and your hotel has an HDTV with HDMI input, you can watch your videos on the screen that is larger than your laptop (if you are the kind of person that brings a laptop on vacation).Thanks to an earlier review here on Amazon, I ordered a Lowepro Rezo 30 case along with my camera.  The ZS7 fits perfectly, and the accessories area can carry an extra storage card and battery.  It's a great value, and I would suggest you buy one as well.

It goes without saying that if you are expecting DSLR like picture quality with this camera, please dont fool yourself. But yes, if you compare apple to apple this is in front of the league. I purchased this as a alternate to DSLR as it is really very compact. First I will talk about good things because of which I rated it as 4 stars:1: Compactness with 12~16x optical zoom: This is just amazing. Having this big of a zoom in a dslr will cost you multi grand investment but here you have it handy. Hats off to Panasonic for creating such a compact body.2: Image Stabilization: Again this is Awesome. If I compare this with my old Canon S3IS, this camera is way too good in respect to image stabilization. In other compacts and point and shoot, I observed as you zoom, blurring effect increases, because of hand shakes. I tried clicking the moon at 17x, and to my surprise, it came exactly as i wanted. I am just loving it.....3: N number of options: Although this is a compact camera you have all the manual setting (apart from manual focus). You have bracketing, metering, burst shooting, numerous scene modes..etc etc. List is endless.4: Speed: Again if you compare this camera among its peers, this is pretty fast in focusing and startup. I havent measured it exactly but yes, it starts fast and focuses fast.5: Burst shooting: For action photography, there is a burst mode in Scene category. Here you can choose Image vs Speed priority and go from 6 fps to 10 fps. Obviously the image quality will degrade a bit in 10fps, but you have a option of it. Not sure why (apart from flip action shutter) DSLR's charge 3k to 4k for such a speed.Now lets cover the things which forced me to not rate this camera 5 star:1: Not for low light shooting: This camera gives excellent image quality in day light but literally not the best if you want to use it in low light. Pictures will be grainy and dark. You can try bracketing, but cannot get the exact sharp image.2: Body construction: Specially Battery lid and playback/shooting slider looks bit weak. The Battery lid just looks like made of plastic and can break or crack easily. And once it is gone, not sure how you are going to use the camera after that. Also the lens cover is thin plastic. So if you accidently press the lens cover while pulling the camera from the case, you may end up with just the body without the lens.3: Image Size option in different modes: Here I may want some help from other users. As far as I understood, in iA mode there are very limited Image size options. If I choose .3M which is recommended for web attachments, then images comes out to be very small in size and break if i zoom a bit. Second option in this mode is 5M (not sure if this stands for 5MP); here the images are very big in size (approx 1.8-2.2 MB). Now this is way too much. There should have been an option of 3MP in every mode, so that you end up with image approx 1 MB. So if there is any way to get the image in between of two sizes (other than opening the 5MP image in photoshop and resizing), please let me know.So over all, this is an excellent point and shoot with lots of features.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with a Few Minor Faults", "Author": "Forrest J.

The GPS is cool, too (although it sucks power like you wouldn't believe).I'd give it 5 stars, except for one very annoying (to me) problem, which I haven't seen covered in other reviews here: incredibly, Panasonic chose to put a non-standard USB jack on the camera. You can only connect it to a computer if you use a special, Panasonic-only cable. I this age when just about every type of consumer electronic device has a regular, mini-, or micro-USB jack, this camera doesn't. They provide a proprietary cable that fits the jack along with the camera... but if you want to connect the camera to a computer to download photos while traveling, say, you have to pack the special cable along with you. And if you loose it, you'll have to order a replacement from Panasonic--no interoperability for you! Oh, and you can't recharge the camera battery through their non-standard USB connector, either.The crazy USB jack isn't a huge issue--my MacBook has a compatible memory card slot in the side, so it's easy to work around it by just moving the memory card back and forth between the camera and my computer when I want to move photos off the camera--but it's the only thing wrong with an otherwise great camera, and it makes no sense to me from a design perspective: it probably cost Panasonic more to use a non-standard jack than a standard one, so why do it, especially on a top-of-the-line camera?

I also bought a Canon SD940is. Although I never owned a Canon it was immediately intuitive without any user's manual. I was shooting and taking videos in 10 minutes. This camera, the ZS7 has lots more features, but it lacks the very cool MY COLORS feature of the latest Powershots. The ZS7 is not as intuitive for me to use because it has lots more manual settings and I was turning things on and off like crazy. If I keep it in iA (Intelligent Auto) I get beautiful pictures unless the light isn't very good. The Image Stabilization is spot on. You can download the manual but it doesn't really help much explaining what certain settings do very well and doesn't give help on how to take better pictures using the many adjustments.But I'm writing this preliminary review to address a couple problems I'm experiencing that may cause me to return this camera unless some of you experts can shed some light on my problems. Hope you know the answers.1. I looked at my camera and noticed that the firmware is version 1.0  I went to the Panasonic website and see that there is a ZS7 upgrade to version 1.1 available to download. However it ways for: DMC-ZS7 (Without DMC-ZS7GK). Now I don't know what that GK stands for, but I'm wondering if it's something I should download. I know that there are problems with non OEM batteries when new firmware versions are downloaded. Wondering what to do here?2. During Playback Mode you can set the Auto Rotate function ON and it should rotate the pics on the screen horizontally or vertically as you display your pictures on the screen.(I'm not using Slideshow) The Canon does this perfectly. This does not appear to work on my ZS7 camera at all. Am I doing something wrong? Is the camera broken?3. I have taken quite a few videos, and in some, but not all, of them I can hear a clicking noise while I am recording and also in the playback. I did a test video last night inside the house and zoomed the heck out of the camera and there were no click at all. I have digital zoom turned off. I recorded in M-JPEG. But some other videos I did a couple days ago have a very audible and annoying clicking noise in them throughout.4. I've played around a lot with the menus and taken a lot of videos and in a matter of a few hours my battery is running down to 2 bars. I took some videos one night then did not use the camera for a couple days and when I went to show someone the pictures the battery was dead almost immediately. However, even though I had done about the same amount of videos the Canon was still chugging away and we took a few more videos, took some pictures and did a slide show of my 120 pics and 5 videos and the battery was still full. WOW! (that's wow in a bad way for the ZS7).Please weigh in camera experts and especially ZS7 owners. Thanks.Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Blue)UPDATE 6/30/12: I've owned this camera almost 2 years now and just thought I should report in. This is BEST CAMERA I have ever owned. I take a lot of pictures for e-Bay stuff and with friends and family. I mostly shoot on the auto setting because it creates nearly perfect pictures. Pictures are crisp, clear and properly balanced. You don't even really need any kind of photo editor for this camera except for cropping and adding text. The pictures are that good. Of course, I'm not a professional photographer. Battery life is good although I always carry a spare battery just in case. The only bad thing is the software that comes with it, it's not very good.

The quality of construction is very good; a metal tripod mount is something you rarely see on a P&S.;  The battery and port doors are much better than what I see on the modern Canon models.  The rear LCD is big and bright.  All of the buttons and switches have a nice feel to them.  Unfortunately it is hard to see the icons on the 4 silver buttons around the menu button.The lens is quite sharp corner to corner at the focals I have tried so far.  I don't see significant CA or significant corner blurring; the lens performance seems to be better than what I've seen with the modern Canon models.  When shooting outdoors the lens is able to resolve very good detail in green grass.  This is something many modern Canon models have trouble with.  The lens stays sharp at the 12x max optical zoom focal.  I also tried the iZoom 16x feature and it worked better than I expected.The iA Full Auto mode seems to work better than Canon's Smart Auto mode. Canon's Smart Auto mode is much more likely to boost the ISO too high and/or pick a shutter speed that is much too slow for a handheld picture.  The ZS7's iA mode usually picks conservative ISO and shutter values.  I've also played with M, S, A, and P and I've tweaked the various \"Intelligent\" features.  All of these features work great.  The ability to store and retrieve three custom setups is great.  The menu isn't as slick looking as Canon's menus, but it works well and offers a surprisingly large number of features.  My wish list includes:* I wish I had the ability to manually pick from more ISO values.* I wish there was a way to pick the flash shutter speed value without dropping to manual mode.* I wish the flash had more power.* When using the Auto ISO mode I wish the camera would allow the shutter speed to drop to the value I set for the \"MIN SHTR SPEED\" before raising the ISO.* I wish the lens was F2.8 or better on the wide end.Color, contrast, detail, and sharpness are very good to excellent in bright outdoor light. The default WB setting is a bit on the cool side, which is ok.  Outdoor images taken in bright light look as good as anything I've seen from any other P&S; camera.  The images do show a significant amount of noise in dark areas, even at low ISO.  The ZS7 performs a significant amount of default sharpening even with the \"Intelligent Resolution\" feature off.  I see more default sharpening with the ZS7 than I do with modern Canon models.  This can be adjusted with \"PICT. ADJ\", but I've yet to change it.The images get really noisy over ISO 400 unless the scene is extremely bright.  The flash does not have much power and flash shots in a dim room can be pretty noisy.  The flash on my wife's small Canon SD1200 sub-compact has more power than the ZS7's flash.  Flash shots taken with the small Canon SD1200 are usually better than the same flash shot taken with the ZS7.  The small Canon gives off more light and the light does not fall off as much.  I sometimes need to take the ZS7 out of iA mode to get good flash pictures in a dim room.  iA mode will sometimes pick a slow sync scene mode that can blur your shot if you are not using a tripod. P mode takes much more consistent flash shots. The same can be said of the Canon.I've yet to play with PICT.ADJ. or movies, but the GPS seems to work well.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "I think this is a low quality product and I can argue it because of the following situations:", "Author": "JOSE ARTURO GOMEZ VELASQUEZ", "ReviewID": "R2Z5ZH9VI3ZHI4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think this is a low quality product and I can argue it because of the following situations:Before the expiration of the warranty, the camera failed and we had to sent it from COLOMBIA to USA IN ORDER TO MAKE EFFECTIVE OUR CAMERA WARRANTY AND THE CASE WAS  REGISTER AT PANASONIC, LIKE THIS:1) warranty for PANASONIC request, before the first year:CAMERA'S PROBLEM INFORMATION.Case No.: 28923597 (number given by the panasonic service)Camera Error: System Error (Focus)CAMERA'S PURCHASE INFORMATION.Order Placed: November 30th 2010Purchase Order Number: 105-3724561-8794631Buyer: Jose Arturo G\u00f3mez Vel\u00e1squez.Price: $ 249.95 USD.2) Request for warranty to PANASONIC (Telephonically, JANUARY 29 DE 2013):The Camera failed again for the same focus problem at January 2013 PANASONIC CALL ( 18002117262, talk to Mr. Jose, who gave me the SERVICE IN SPANISH) AND SAY NO WARRANTY EVEN WHEN THE PROBLEM IT IS THE SAME THAT THE CAMERA HAS BEFORE.

I think the ZS10 is now available, but the ZS10 actually lowered some of the features to lesser quality.Why this Point & Shoot? There's lots of features on this P&S;, but here are the more notable features I love compared to other P&S; cameras:1) It's one of (2) P&S; which allows not only Manual Settings, but full manual based on Aperture, Shutter & Picture. Many don't offer the ability to manually alter the Shutter Speed, let alone the Aperture. To those of us who are photo nuts who want full manual control, this camera delivers.2) While just about all P & S cameras offer 12 or 14 megapixels, there is one small aspect they don't tell you. If you raise ISO settings (to allow more light) above 800, 99% of all P&S; cameras default to only 6 megapixels. Meaning: you don't get that shot in 12 or 14 you thought you were taking.  Panasonic has put a ton of money into fixing ISO issues with P&S; cams, thus when you raise the ISO settings to 800, 1200, 2400, even 3200, the shot is still in 12 Megapixel.  Only Nikon has one P&S; that comes close to this.3) The 12x optical zoom is more than you'll ever need, but covers a great focal length4) Dual Stereo mics & GPS tagging. Love both features.

My last Canon was the PowerShot SD-790, which I am sure most of you know, is a GREAT camera. I have had the SD-790 camera for 3 years and I was ready for something new, so I can pass the Canon to one of my kids :-)  After lots of reviews and research, I decided on the Panasonic Lumix DMS-ZS7.  I hope that I save you the time of doing the research and reviews with my review here. It rated high for Picture Quality and Ease of Use from most of the reviews I have read. I consider myself an intermediate photographer, so I like playing around with manual settings on a camera. This Panasonic allows you to do that, so you can get creative with your pictures. If you like to just point and shoot, this camera performs that as well and I must say, it is easy. With this Panasonic, you can set custom settings and other camera modes, depending on the environment you are in. With the simple turn of a dial, you can have your saved custom setting come up quickly and you will be ready for action.  While playing around with my Panasonic settings, I discovered a FOOD setting, which I did not know it had. I love to take pictures of the food I ate at restaurants and post it on my Facebook account. I also like to BLOG with pictures of recipes I cook. So as you probably are thinking, I was VERY excited to find that setting on this camera! The 14X Optical Zoom is another awesome feature I like about this Panasonic camera. If you know cameras, the better the optical zoom range, as opposed to digital zoom, the better :-)  If any of you already own Panasonic Digital Cameras, you probably are aware how nice these cameras are.

It has excellent features and numerous fun and useful mode settings. The pinhole and the film grain effects are two of my favorites. It should be noted that these special effects can also be applied to the full HD video also.  The video recording utilizes full time auto focus and you have full use of the cameras optical zoom, this with the great image stabilizer makes for excellent video quality. There is a full range of manual settings on this camera as well, however, for some reason they did not include manual focus. For the person who is not all that up on how to make custom camera settings/adjustments, the Intelligent Auto setting makes using this camera a breeze... There are some quite advanced capabilities in this mode that are beyond the scope of this review to expound upon. let it suffice to say that it really does an excellent job of analyzing the environment you are taking the picture in and making the appropriate setting adjustments so your pictures turn out looking great. The built in GPS is useful for tagging the location of your picture for future reference. The only real negative issue I have with this camera is the small size of the image sensor. As with many cameras in this category, the small sensor does not lend itself to the best low light photography. In low light situations, you will notice some digital noise in the picture. However, in normal light this camera has excellent photo quality. I have been using this camera for a couple months now when I don't want to lug around my other equipment.

It is an excellent camera for taking casual outdoor snapshots while I travel. It is small and light enough for carrying anywhere all day. The intelligent automatic features works well in many occasions I encounter while I travel. The GPS works as advertised. If I use it under a good condition and give it ample time to catch up, it is very accurate. It is so much fun, because it tells me the name of a landmark that I am shooting at (even if I don't know what I am looking at...). I'm sure I will appreciate even more in 5 yeas when I forget what I shot. Automatic time zone adjustment is a subtle but nice bonus that comes with the GPS.

I cannot do without a spare battery on any camera anyway.Like any other camera, the camera doesn't give everything I want under all conditions.

I have many friends who are independent photographers who swear by their digital SLRs, but I needed a camera that was more compact to be my primary travel camera - meant primarily to capture memories and events.  However, I did love the quality of the SLR photos and hoped to find a camera that could approximate that.This camera is absolutely phenomenal and consistently surprises me with the photos it takes.  In situations such as high speed or low light this point and shoot out performs the Canon I previously had by a long shot.  For more controlled settings, the images are crisp, and well focused.  The color it can capture is rich and more true to life than any other point and shoot I've ever used or seen - sunsets on this camera actually show up with the rich oranges, pinks and purples.  The video also works quite well - I went to a concert and was able to zoom all the way to the stage which was quite a ways away and get a really decent video of the performance - even with the strange lighting and noticeable distance.There are a few button layouts that aren't immediately intuitive, but can be figured out with a bit of tinkering and experimenting.  The special scene settings, again, work WAY better than any I've used in the past.  The general intelligent auto setting is actually quite intelligent - from macro to portrait to landscape it usually identifies the scene correctly, and within a couple attempts I've been able to get the exact shot I was trying for.I had been certain I would purchase a Nikon or a Canon, but I was impressed by the photos others shared, taken by this camera and can pleasantly report that it requires no skill or special knowledge to take similar photos.3 October 2011 -I STILL love this camera.

It is by no means professional photography quality, but for a small, affordable point and shoot, it has exceeded my expectations.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good choice for a multi-purpose camera", "Author": "Bob Allen \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R3UMQ3S77LGAYN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:  Although the wide range of settable options may make the operation of this camera appear complicated, the intelligent automatic setting works very well, making manual settings unnecessary in most circumstances.  With automatic \"point and shoot\" mode, it usually takes fantastic, sharp shots.  The zoom range is great, and it takes good videos, with zoom.  The screen is large and bright, except in sunlight.  Cons:  I guess no camera can be perfect or be all things.  This one's main shortcoming is its lack of a viewfinder, which makes it a multi-purpose, not an all-purpose, camera.  I made the mistake of taking mine to an air show.  Even with the screen brightness on high, I could see absolutely nothing in it in the bright sun.  It took excellent pictures if I happened to aim it in the right direction, but forget taking video of moving objects.  I erased a lot of pictures of nothing.  A few other weaknesses:  Buttons are very small.  There is no manual focus.  It rarely happens that the camera doesn't focus better than can be done manually, but it can happen.  The camera is heavy for its size.  I wonder if plastic is really all that bad.  It certainly would be lighter.  It does have a good grip/feel, though.  The wide angle does produce some \"fish eye\" effect, especially noticeable in panning video or with buildings in the picture.  Unfortunately, there is no indication of \"normal,\" and if you change the zoom, it returns to wide angle if you turn it off and back on.  There is only a brief printed manual; the main manual is on the disk in PDF format.  It would be a book if printed (177 pages).  As with most all compact cameras, the flash is not powerful, but you could always use a slave flash.  Except for 5-second clips with pictures, it will not record sound without video, nor can you add sound to pictures after taking them.  Overall, the cons are minor annoyances I can live with to get the beautiful pictures and movies it takes.  It certainly has more capabilities than I will ever use.

However, the GPS only updates every 5 minutes -- and only if it can find a satellite, which it usually cannot (like in most buildings).The result is that most photos are completely mis-tagged because it uses the last available GPS location for its tagging. My cell phone, amazingly, is orders of magnitude more accurate because it is able to locate a satellite very easily (even in buildings, like your house), and if it can't locate one, it doesn't tag the photo with incorrect information.

After a lot of research I chose the ZS7 with hopes that it would provide good bang for the buck in terms of usability and image quality.I found it to be relatively easy to use after a couple of hours walking through all the features and settings.  The metal body has a solid feel and despite it's size, it's not hard to handle.  I did find myself wishing that it had some rubber in the grip area, as the all metal and chrome body can become slippery.The number of options may seem daunting at first, but it didn't take long to figure out the shooting modes I would use regularly.  I noted that the \"intelligent Auto\" modes make it easy for a beginner to get good results with little fuss, but it was really the manual and priority modes that I found most useful.  Anyone comfortable with a DSLR should find the additional controls a welcome addition to a P&S.;  I found I could get superior results by working in the PSAM modes, primarily because I could keep the camera working in it's sweet spots as far as ISO sensitivity, aperture and shutter speed goes.Despite such a small package, the controls are easy to reach and don't interfere with shooting.  In shooting mode, the cursor buttons provide quick shortcuts to some features, like flash mode, macro modes and self timer, but I was surprised that these features were nowhere to be found in the GUI menu.I'm getting good to very good results in image quality at full resolution up to ISO 400.  ISO 800 will work fine for small prints, and ISO 1600 may be usable for web and downsized prints.  At ISO 1600, besides being grainy, I get significant color noise (mostly dull yellow blotches) throughout.  With the exception of the noise at higher ISO settings, the images seem clear and fairly distortion free throughout the zoom range.The 25-300 zoom range is very usable especially considing a package that slips easily in my front shirt pocket.  The image stablization is a must for long shots, and seems to do a very good job of reducing motion blur.  I was surprised that I could take photos at around 1/30 of a second without noticeable shake.I'm very please so far with the versatility and performance of this little camera.

Scenes can be useful, but intelligent auto usually pics appropriate settings.  It is very easy to just turn on, leave in auto mode, and snap good pictures.  Works great with a 16GB SD card.  Camera can be controlled (for viewing pictures only) via HDMI and a TV remote.  The menu system on the camera works great once you get used to it.Picture quality is good for this kind of camera.  To my knowledge, all pocket superzoom cameras with high megapixel sensors suffer from noise.  In good light noise is only visible if you zoom into the image.  In dim light quality definitely suffers, but the images are still acceptable, just not as sharp as you would get with a different kind of camera.Compared to my old 5MP Canon Powershot S50 which only had a 5MP sensor, the images are noticeably more noisy when viewed on a computer and zoomed in. Whereas the Canon's images were blurred at the same magnification level. Neither took exceptionally sharp images (when magnified.) The trade off with these high megapixel cameras seems to be more noise for less blurring, but again, picture quality in good/decent light is more than good enough for normal size prints or viewing on PC.Video quality is decent.  Certainly not anywhere near the same level as the professional HD video shot for TV or movies, but good enough for a non-specialized camera.I looked very hard at the Canon SX210 IS before purchasing this camera, but ultimately chose this one for its ergonomics and button placement.

We had the ZS6 for 2 months. The pictures were good especially the outdoor picture but I always wonder why the pictures is not as good as the samples uploaded by the ZS7 users here on Amazon. I was thinking that it maybe because of different setting and/or lighting condition compare to what I have.To make the story short, my father-in-law recently purchased a ZS7 and when I looked at the pictures it took, I immediately noticed that pictures are much clearer than the ZS6. I took our camera out and shoot them both indoor and outdoor. Both camera uses the same settings 80% - 90% of the time but the pictures taken from ZS7 is always clearer than the ZS6 we have. He said that he purchased it from Fry's for a little over $300.00. Since our local warehouse have a 90 day return policy, I asked my wife if she wanted to change it, she said why not check their display first and compare the pictures to see if the problem is just with the unit I got. I went to our local warehouse and to compare the quality of my ZS6 to the one in their display and they are identical plus I noticed that the price went down by $60 dollars. So, I looked around and I found this on Amazon for $249 (as of Oct. 2010) with free shipping and no tax. I placed my order and once I received the package, I charged the battery and compare it again to our ZS6. The new ZS7 pictures still shows up clearer. I updated the firmware of the ZS6 to the latest 1.1 and compare them again but the ZS7 pictures still looks sharper both in the camera LCD and on my 24 inches monitor.I packaged the ZS6 back and returned it to my local warehouse 2 days ago. I have to buy a new case and memory as the regular retail package does not come with a case and a memory but I know that I am now getting a better picture compare to the discounted product I got from my local warehouse.  Also, I turned off the GPS to make it last longer, I will probably used it when we go on vacation.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-ZS7 is the best compact non-SLR camera I have used.", "Author": "John M. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R2L67CF020L9JM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera (Panasonic DMC-ZS7) after extensive research on the internet and in a local camera store.  I have had 3 different Canon camera's over the years, the most recent being the SD890is and have loved all of them for the time.  The feature that we liked on the SD890is was the longer than normal 5x optical zoom.  The only problem was that the shot to shot speed was slow.  So when this camera broke, we searched for an alternative.  We scrubbed our search down to the Panasonic and the Canon SX210is.  Based on reviews of the pop up flash on the canon and a slower shot to shot speed we went with the Panasonic.  This was a tough choice considering I know Canon cameras (quality is great etc) and had not heard much from others on Panasonic.On to the review:Right out of the box, this camera is easy to use.  It has a fantastic 12x optical zoom and incredible quality in the finished picture.  The Intelligent Auto is very quick to determine the appropriate scene and adjust settings accordingly.  There is even a cool tagging feature that allows you to register frequently shot individuals.  At that point the camera recognizes the face and puts the primary focus on them and also uses this tag in the software on the computer so you can sort by person if you would like.  The menus are extensive, although many of the maual controls such as balance, shutter speed etc are way beyond my understanding.In a snapshot:This camera offers the best possible zoom, picture quality and speed of a non-SLR (Big lense) camera.  I would absolutely buy again.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera with great HD video recording", "Author": "Brian A.", "ReviewID": "R35VXP2L7ZNDXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't used my new camera extensively yet, but I'm loving it.  The day after purchasing I used it with a tripod to record a 1 hour training session at work.  The battery only went down 1 notch.  It will record video as long as the battery hasn't ran out and there is enough storage on the card.  I wish it had the option to plug it in and run video, but as that isn't this camera's primary purpose, I can't complain about it.I picked up 2 spare batteries for an awesome price (knock off brands) and they work fine, despite having read that Panasonic had limited use of off brand batteries.  2 Pack of Panasonic DMW-BCG10 Replacement Batteries 1200MAH Each For Panasonic Lumiz DMC-ZS5 DMC-ZS7 + Free Pack Of LCD Screen ProtectorsThe quality is great.  The camera menu system took sometime to understand and it uses a lot of acronyms that I can't find the meaning of for quality sizes, but looking at storage availability increasing/decreasing told me which setting was higher/lower quality.  The Q. Menu (quick?) button is the lifesaver for the menu.  It makes it really easy to change the most important settings without going into the full menu system.  I also like the exposure button for the manual setting as it makes changes to the shutter and aperture settings very easy (easier than my Nikon D60!).It is not necessarily a small pocket camera, but it will fit easily into most pockets.  But as the bulk is for the great zoom length and the optics, it is fine by me as I want an easily portable camera that takes high quality pictures.I haven't had a chance to try the GPS geotagging yet, but as this is going with me on a week long backcountry kayaking/hiking trip (hence the 3 total batteries), it will get some use.I would recommend only that you watch for deals that keep this well under MSRP as it is listed elsewhere for way too much (Amazon rocks for this), they are out there and it's not worth overpaying for any product.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome camera", "Author": "David L.

Being a perfect camera, it happens to be excellent camcorder too, surpassing any standard definition camcorder, and on par with entry level HD camcorders. AVCHD is handy, you can burn AVCHD disks and play on SONY or Panasonic TVs and BD players straight. I can recommend a software called multiAVCHD for authoring, it is free.

There is only a very brief getting started manual included with a more extensive 91 page manual supplied on disk. The latter is very complete but not always easy to figure out. I printed the relevant sections of the manual out which makes it easier to use. Likewise the menus on the camera will take some getting used to. The software which is a source of many complaints was completely useless for me because it is not compatible with Windows 7 64 bit operating system. It took a week to get a response from Panasonic clarifying this. There are other software alternatives as suggested in various forums.

My old Sony Cyber shot had seen better days, and I needed something smaller than my Canon 20D, and all the lenses.Very pleased with the camera. Yes there is a learning curve if you want to use all the features ( GPS, different modes ). But overall, it takes really good pictures in the auto everything setting, it is weak in low light, but the flash is adequate.The zoom is amazing, optical goes to around 16X, but the digital zoom in different settings goes to something like 63X. With the stabilization it takes a good picture, there is distortion when enlarged, but I am impressed when you consider it is a $ 300 camera. Wide angle is not bad either.I purchased a few 4gb SD chips, each holds 600 - 700 pictures in the best resolution setting, battery lasts a good lenght of time ( always buy an extra though ). Have not done too much video but the picture was good, zoom is slower ( but not bad ) and sound is clear.Overall, I am impressed with the camera technology, 12MP on this size camera is pretty good, controls are easy to use. It is my first camera without a viewfinder, but the LED screen is large and bright even in sunlight, so it was not hard to get use to. For any level photographer it is a fun little camera, more than enough for someone getting started, especially if it is more for kids parties, and vacations.

Didn't have a lot of time to read all the instructions (which are mostly on disk as PDF files only). But the camera is so simple to learn I really had no problems at all (disclaimer- I am a professional photographer). Great Leica lens; image stabilization works wonderfully, and HD video is quite impressive (780p).Using an Intel Mac running OS X 10.6+ and having iLife 09 installed allows you to import AVCHD-Lite HD video directly from the camera into iMovie, bypassing needing a PC to import and then converting files for editing. Older non-Intel Macs or those without iLife 09 will not be able to import from the camera.I will say that the Panasonic software on the PC does allow easy uploading of video to Youtube- unedited except for simple crops.Pros- ease of use; quality of video (still images are nice too); very compact size, can use with my Mac.Cons- Manuals are only on CD as PDF files; Panasonic software not the best/easiest to use on a PC.Would have given 5 stars if they had made Mac importing software or better software for the PC.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for video recording concerts..", "Author": "David Doebler", "ReviewID": "R2D3GW7NC4IA8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this for one simple goal - recording concerts (especially with load volumes).

The low light picture quality is also quite good, although I haven't taken enough photos to be an accurate judge. I am typically a Canon guy, and have owned 5 of their Elph series over the years.

It is perfect size, takes great pictures and video - WHILE IT STILL WORKS.  The first one, which I still have and use extensively is for the most part just fine except for the white spec of lint or something on the inside of the lens. This does not persent a problem for still shots as the spot is outside the focus length.  But for video, it is another story as the spot shows in every video similar to a sun spot on the lens when that occurs.  I will live with this issue in fear of returning an otherwise perfect camera for a refurbished one, which is the normal procedure for Panasonic, that might not be as good.But the real reason for this post is to inform potential buyers that a quality control problem must exist with this camera as two of them failed in less than two weeks.  Both were purchased from Amazon, so an exchange or refund will be processed through their normal procedures.  I have never had two consequetive cameras fail completely in such a short period.  Don't bother trying to talk to Customer Service as they are clewless about this issue.  Camera works fine for several days both still and video shots then fails to turn on the next time you try to use it. Using a new Panasonic extra battery did not solve the problem and nothing would make the cameras restart.So, buyer beware as it seems there is a run of cameras from Panasonic which have an inherent flaw of some type in them.My ZS3, and FZ35 have been flawless as well as the first ZS7 but not the recent last two.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not exactly an improvement", "Author": "spin_nin", "ReviewID": "R4RPEUFNGBFCZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ4S 8.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver) whose lens cover stopped working. Prior to that the pictures it took, in all conditions, were really good.I replaced it with the ZS7 hoping to have the same, if not better, picture quality. That has not been the case. Has the same great Leica lens as the older model but images are a little more distorted or pixelated on the ZS7. The video quality is far superior to that of the TZ4 and the LCD is much nicer on the ZS7.One area that concerns me is that the camera cannot focus / does not focus at the mid way point of the zoom. around 6x - 8x zoom it simply will not focus. Doesn't matter where I am, how the camera is set, or what the lighting conditions are. The mid way point on the zoom is useless. I have missed many photo opps because of this.The older TZ4 was less complicated but, like I said, it took good pictures 90% of the time on the auto or iA setting. The ZS7 requires a lot more know how and fussing about to get the same picture quality as the older one. Screwing around with the camera can lead to missing a shot. People complain about how long it takes to turn on a camera and be ready for a shot sometimes. Makes me laugh. If you have to turn it on and wait plus get all the settings right you are not really taking advantage of a point & shoot camera. Might as well go for the DSLR at that rate.Sure, I admit that this would have been capable of taking better pictures than the older model thanks to its adjustability but the new image processor gets in the way. The ZS7 still isn't going to give you DSLR quality pics no matter how much you adjust it. Without the option of storing images in the RAW formaat it isn't really worth all the adjustability. Not even close. I think this is meant to fill the gap between point & shoot & DSLR (leaning heavily toward point & shoot in my opinion). Gone is the VIVID color setting from the older model which is sorely missed on the new model. I have found the color reproduction to be much better with Canon & Fuji cameras. Fuji has really fallen off, more & more each year with their image quality - overcomplicating simple designs that, in the past, worked brilianty. The video button on the ZS7 is too easy to hit by accident (took a 2 hour video by accident without even knowing it).After being very disappointed with this camera and its completely useless GPS function and Panasonic's proprietary batteries (genius for them to make money but horrible for the consumer) which run down very quickly in this camera (yes, I turned the GPS off) I cannot recommend this camera to anyone.I did try out the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black) and found it to be fantastic. Simple, easy to use, great pictures, & at a fraction of the cost ZS7. Video quality is pretty decent too. I gave up some zoom but if you drop the MegaPixels down the zoom increases. 12MP is pushing it for the sensor size on both Lumix cameras. All the manufacturers out there need to stop the MP nonsense and get back to what matters - picture quality.*Update* I did a little more research & it seems that even the professional reviewers agree - older is better when it comes to the ZS7. ([...].). Don't get me wrong here people -I like Panasonic cameras! They had a great design and they changed it - not for the better in my opinion.I also purchased a Canon PowerShot SX130IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD jst before the holiday. The picture quality is a vast improvement nut it has it's downsides as well.Is there a perfect compact camera out there? Maybe, but I haven't come across it yet. I also purchased a Canon PowerShot SD1300 IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver). Like the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver) these are two VERY GOOD point and shoot cameras. I think the Canon gives you slightly more manual control but, really, were splitting hairs here. Both cameras give you very good picture quality out of the box while the Canon PowerShot SX130IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD does alright on auto it is capable of some phenominal pictures if you take the time to adjust it properly based on your given situations. While both the ZS7 and SX130IS are considered \"compact\" I really don't feel either belong in this catagory, especially the Canon SX130IS. Too big, too bulky, too much adjustabilty for the absolute best picture quality (the SX130IS is much less expensive than the ZS7 too). If Panasonic reads these reviews, I implore you to take a step back in order to move forward. What you had in the TZ4 & ZS3 wasn't broken but you fixed it and the image quality suffered.

To not have a long cord, but just a simple 2 prong arrangement is fabulous. And the big screen was great.But I was very disappointed with the quality of the camera. I particular the shots even in focus are not sharp, which really surprised me from a Leica lens, as i used to have leicas and the lenses were sharp as a tack. This must be their low end line. i'm a semi-pro, so i know wherefore I speak on this. In addition, the colors are not accurate, and the camera is just plain slow. i used it to shoot a party, and most of the shots were blurry.No wonder so many people don't think they can take photos-so much equipment is inferior.I was so excited to have a camera that I could just put in my pocket that I was willing to forego having RAW. But this is not for me.I tried the smaller one as well, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch, and that was very Mickey Mouse. In comparison, the Nikon P6000 beats them both by a country mile, though it has a long cord on the battery charger, the battery runs out too quickly, and is a bit larger. Oh well.

The intent was to use this camera while riding a tandem and being able to take one handed pictures with it.  Most small cameras have too narrow a lens (28 to 30mm) which is fine for close up shots, but not so good for scenery shots.Overall, the camera works just fine.  The image stabilization is not as good as my Nikon, but then again, it did not cost as much as my Nikon.  The grip on the camera leaves a lot to be desired though.  There is not enough of a ridge to safely hold the camera with one hand and to take pictures with.Low level light shots are the worst I have seen short of camera phones and IPOD touch camera.  The pictures turn out very grainy.  If you are in low light levels, ensure that you are using a flash and/or using a tripod.My biggest complaint has to do with Panasonic Service (or lack of service) when there is an issue.  When the camera arrived, we took the camera and everything out of the package and it all looked just fine.  We started using the camera on a trip almost immediately.  When we got home two weeks later, we went to install the software so that we could download the pictures from the camera.  That is where the trouble started.  The software disk had a hidden flaw on it.  From the package, it looked just fine.  But remove the disk and look at the shinny surface where the data is recorded and you see a very large crack!  Well, we could either ship the entire thing back to Amazon since we were within 30 days or contact Panasonic. Since we were keeping the camera, we thought the best thing to do was contact Panasonic.  That was a BIG mistake!!  Panasonic took 2 weeks, several e-mails and phone calls to decide it was not there problem since it was now outside of the 30 day warranty from the ship date of the camera!  I reminded them that the first contact with their company was within the 30 days and they finally agreed to ship a replacement.  Well, many weeks later, still NO software!!!!!!!!I am currently using my Nikon software to take pictures from the camera, but I have no manual since that is on the disk and there is NO option to download a manual from the Panasonic website!!  I have been told that if I want a manual, I have to purchase the software!!!Overall, I would NOT recommend this company to anyone based upon their service response.  I would presume that the rest of their warranty on their camera is not worth much either.  This leaves me with the feeling that this is a throw away camera, and a very expensive one for that type of camera!If you buy this camera, CHECK the condition of the software disk immediately!!  If it is damaged, return the camera for a new one!!  Do NOT trust Panasonic to replace the disk!!!!!", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Value!", "Author": "David Solomon", "ReviewID": "R1BJXM58DUK0CV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've spent the last few weeks researching cameras and decided that my needs were fairly basic. I was all set on the Panasonic FH-20 - a great little point and shoot, and then after further discussion with my wife, decided that it would be far better to get a camera that we could replace a camcorder as well - one which would allow us to record a decent amount of movie in HD. That meant going for one which would record in the AVCHD format. Having seen all the rave reviews of the ZS7 on Amazon I was sold. I then had to try and justify paying the price! Last week I was at my local Costco and they were selling this wonderful camera for just $199 (that's not a misprint!), and what's more, it came with a 2GB SD card and a genuine Panasonic Lumix case! They only had 4 left in the store and I was not going to miss out.The camera itself has been a joy to use. It has a quality feel to it. I like the fact that it is a little weighty. The buttons work with a precision that I appreciate. The Leica lens is just amazing and I never would have expected it on a camera of this price. Panasonic really have nailed it with this camera. I've mostly taken indoor photos and have found that those without flash have been absolutely great. I've used macro quite a bit. Occasionally it takes a while to focus in macro zoom but once it does, pictures are razor sharp. With flash it can be variable but try different settings until you see what works best for you. I also like the black and white grain setting for that nostalgic look. I also can't wait to experiment with the Starry Sky scene mode once I get my tripod.I haven't taken too much video but the quality is very high and I don't have a problem with the AVCHD format since I have never edited my video's in all the years I used a camcorder.I took the advice of a previous reviewer and experimented with the digital zoom. It really is up to 63.8x zoom - amazing.I did not buy this camera for the GPS and have it turned off permanently. I chose this rather than the ZS5 because of the AVCHD format and the slightly larger screen, and as it turned out, the deal from Costco on this camera was CHEAPER than the ZS5!To anyone looking to buy this camera I would give 2 pieces of advice: go to Costco - no - run to Costco before they sell out! Secondly, read the manual thoroughly, and work through all the features in the first few days. I got so frustrated with the negative reviews from people who were too lazy to do so, and then returned the camera after a few days, or had complained because they had unrealistic expectations and were comparing it to their DSLR. This is not helpful at all to those looking for an honest review. As for the battery, I'm fine with it. With the money you save at Costco, go an buy a 2nd battery or use the money you've saved in not having to buy a case or card, to do so. Honestly, this is a stunning camera in looks and ability. I carry it around with me all the time (the case is designed to fit on my belt). As your photography skills grow, this is a camera that will grow with you. All the manual settings will see to that. I've had SLRs in the past, before the digital age, and I'm done with all that. This camera does everything I want and much, much more.

I am an avid backpacker, hiker and enjoy travel and sightseeing. After several months of researching I settled on the Panasonic Lumix Sx7. I wanted a camera that had an adequate optical zoom, built in GPS or capable that provided at least 10 mega pixels. I read all the reviews, went to various camera stores and handled several others and decided to take the plunge and buy the Panasonic.I have yet to find anything about this camera I do not like. The pictures I have taken thus far have been amazing. I have used the GPS to test it and found it to be very accurate and easy to use. Battery life has been acceptable but I have ordered a spare for longer trips. The camera fits nicely in a small case I wear attached to my waist belt for easy access. I have been able to get 270 photos out of a single charge over a three day period. This is with the GPS on and using the flash for 40-50 photos. The optical/digital zoom is perfect for long range shots. The macro is awesome and provides very nice up close photos. The facial recognition feature works like a charm. I am not a fan of video but have used the video feature a couple of times and find it acceptable and viewable. The sound is fair when using the video feature.I would recommend this camera to anyone who seeks a compact camera for travel or someone who just wants a good camera for all around use. I'm planning a six week trip of the John Muir in September and can't wait to take this camera along.April 2, 2011 update:I have taken over 1000 pictures now and have yet to find anything I do not like about this camera. I have purchased two additional batteries. I have found the GPS cuts the battery life in half when left on all the time. The drain when the camera is turned off but not the GPS is neglagible. But when using the camera with GPS on the drain is noticible. If you have a spare battery it should not be a big deal. I have two.The optical and digital zoom is fantastic. I have played with the zoom at various lengths and am completely satisfied with the results. The close up and macro features work well but take some getting use to using.All in all I am pleased with the decision to purchase the Panasonic Lumix ZS-7.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Picture Quality", "Author": "Rodrigo Antonio Menendez", "ReviewID": "R3875GT3YQ058E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and reviewed many digital cameras.

The iZoom feature giving 16x zoom at full resolution is good enough to leave on all the time. Although the camera has a plethora of manual settings the iAuto setting is so effective in a wide variety of situations anyone looking for a simple point-and-shoot should be very happy with it.

I've always been partial to Canons as they were the first digital cameras I had owned but the picture quality and lens were completely outclassed by the Panasonic.  I returned it and then went to the new Nikon S8100 (probably just because of the commercials) which I kept for several weeks, but again I was disappointed with the lens and picture quality.  The \"wide-angle\" of the Canon and Nikon were not even close to as wide as the Panasonic, although they claim the same specifications.  I can say firsthand the Panasonic gets more of your subject into the phot than the other two.  The photo quality was not nearly as good on the Canon or Nikon either, and the Nikon has an annoying pop-up flash that seemed very flimsy and wouldn't always latch into the down position which got to be very annoying.  I then went back to the next generation Lumix and couldn't be happier - great photos, super easy to use, cool features, great lens, and I almost forgot to mention it's best attribute - when you press the button, it actually takes the picture!  No more telling your friends to wait while you press the button and wait for 15 seconds and try to guess when the camera will actually take the picture - this camera takes it almost immediately, which was another issue I had with both other cameras but especially the Canon.  There is also a \"burst\" picture setting which is great for getting action shots - neither the Nikon or Canon offers this.I will say the size and styling of the Panasonic are not perfect - it's much more bulky than the Canon and not as stylish as the Nikon, but the ease of use and fantastic photos more than make up for it in my opinion.I haven't used the GPS function yet (does anyone really need this?) so I cannot review that aspect.All in all this is a great camera for the price and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good travel companion", "Author": "Photobug", "ReviewID": "R1V01PQ6OSBR24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Canon user all the time, worn up 3 Canons since 2001.

This camera has Bracketing, which the new Nikon D3100 doesn't have. With Bracketing, you can experiment with High Dynamic Range photography. And the zoom lens covers 25-300 mm (35mm equivalent). So you don't have to buy another lens for telephoto shots like you would have to do with an entry level D-SLR. The camera will zoom in movie mode, and there's no audio noise when it does. And image stabilization also works in movie mode. It does have it's limitations. Image quality is best at the lower ISO levels. ISO 80 is best. A high ISO photo of foliage shows the camera's biggest image limitation. But I've taken some very sharp low-light photos at ISO 400, with a shutter speed of 1/4 second. You can get away with the longer exposures because of the image stabilization. Image quality is also good when making low-light videos.

I took pictures of the same subjects with the same lighting conditions, and the pictures taken with the older camera were sometimes better. Readers are probably thinking, \"Then use the other camera, you big dummy.\" Maybe, but that two-year-old Panasonic has been sold on Ebay.I will say that with learning and practice, the number of keeper photos I've been taking has been increasing.A few pictures of apples taken with the food scene mode were outstanding, clear and sharp, but not all of the other pictures have been impressive. I just may have unreasonable expectations. The zoom mode is quite good, however. Wedding pics I took at an outdoor venue mostly turned out clear and vivid.Effects like Happy mode and pinhole can be achieved with better control by using the free Picasa photo program. I love the transform mode and have had lots of fun with it. Using this mode one can thinnify or widen the subject. Most of my subjects like their pictures taken in the thinnify mode.If you are trying to decide between this camera and the less expensive ZS5, I'd say spend the extra bucks for the ZS7.

As noted by others reviews, the folks at Panasonic, without letting folks know in their specifications or literature, have blocked use of any battery but theirs. While generic batterys will work fine in their older cameras for 10 bucks the panasonic battery for the zs7 is 50 dollars. One can find it for around 30 dollars on sale online but thats still 3 times the cost. Theres another consideration. Tthe GPS function chews up the battery and battery life fairly quickly compared to previous cameras. I use my camera a lot and wear out a couple batterys a year without the GPS in a camera. That means i am spending 40 to 80 bucks a year more to use this camera than if i could buy generic batterys and double that cost if i use the GPS function. With that in mind, for the average 3 years i have a camera before i lose break or retire a camera, i could have a camera twice as good as the ZS7 for the same overall cost.If money is no object buy a better camera. If it is, buy a competitor you can get batterys at a competitive price. I am returning my ZS7 for a different camera. Panasonic has lost a loyal customer. I won't be recomendng any of their products again.

Forget about taking any group pictures in non-daylight settings over this distance without software brightening later (with consequent image quality loss in other areas). Exposure compensation does not help at all in flash mode. This is a real shame a really bad decision on the part of the designers. I've had much more compact and cheaper cameras from Nikon and Casio that were useable to double that distance, i.e., 4 times the light output (in the case of the Nikon)!Aside from this (major for me) limitation, it's an exceptionally good camera. The optics are better than any other compact camera I've had (it's is not super-compact, but reasonable considering the optics). I REALLY like the fact that it's much wider angle that most cameras at the widest angle setting, which makes it much more useful when you're struggling to get everything in, especially for videos.The manual mode allows exposures to 60 seconds; I've taken photos of a starlit sky and can see stars on the photo that were invisible to the naked eye! Really like this feature.ACVHD video mode was not useful to me--can't find software to play it back properly and needs a lot of CPU to decode which makes the video stutter. But if you're willing to play back on the camera and connect to a TV, it works fine. But the standard non-ACVHD modes are fine for my purpose.GPS was also not useful to me (it tagged family wedding photos with that of a cemetery some distance away because that's where it last locked to a satellite ...) and drains the battery unnecessarily.

I also didn't want to trade off too much quality and capacity for the sake of convenience. In the Panasonic Lumix ZS7, I believe I have found a good compromise. By comparison, it weighs almost nothing and is small enough to be carried in the palm of my hand. The picture quality it has produced is excellent. The zoom capacity and focal length is more than adequate for my purposes. The 25mm equivalent wide angle is better than most regular lenses as is the 300mm equivalent telescopic length. It has more bells and whistles than I'll probably ever use, but the flexibility of its controls is outstanding. If I have any criticisms, it would be that the zoom mechanism is not very easy to control, but that may improve with practice and I would have like to have had a viewfinder in addition to the LCD moniter.One criticism I have of Panasonic, but is also applicable to other tech companies these days is that they do not supply a paper, in depth, operating manual. You must either rely on going to your computer and downloading it, or taking an hour and a sheaf of paper to print it from the download. And then, you are stuck with this unwieldy stack of 8x11 paper instead of a compact, bound manual that you can carry anywhere. Also, I understand that it is financially beneficial to Panasonic, but I wish that they had not made the power source (Battery) and USB ports proprietary. If either is lost or damaged, you don't always have the option of buying Panasonic products.After all is said and done, the Lumix ZS7 is probably the best choice in its price range of digital point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Happy camper!", "Author": "Bunny", "ReviewID": "R291IK8IMUN4C8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Extremely happy with the camera.

The camera is awesome in so many ways. The photo quality in adequate light is outstanding. The low light photo quality has some grainyness, but you can control the ISO which improves quality (albeit a darker image is the result). The manual controls are many. I especially like the high speed setting (max resolution of 3 MP) which makes catching that quick shot very easy. The video quality set at 720p looks groovy on my 48 inch HDTV. The GPS hasn't yet locked onto a satelitte at our house, so I can't comment on that feature. The 3 inch LCD has a setting to brighten the screen in direct sunlight. This LCD has 460,000 pizels which has twice the resolution of most camera LCDs. The images on the LCD are true eye candy!PROS: Small, versatile point and shot that fits snuggly into your shirt pocket.  Excellent picture and video quality with good lighting; modest picture  in low light settings. Great manual control options (once you get over the  slight learning curve). Superior high speed shots with emphasis on either  speed or image quality.Cons: Although other reviews have rated the battery life as short, I played with  the camera non-stop for about 2 hours (images and video), and the battery  still had 1 of 3 bars remaining. The GPS has some difficulty locking onto  a satelitte signal, which makes this feature a challenge to use.Bottom Line: You will not be sorry you bought this camera.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "beautiful HD video for YouTube but editing software does little", "Author": "Canyon Birder", "ReviewID": "R2FMKXEHN7GZJG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We are using this point & shoot for uploading video to YouTube and we've had a steep learning curve with using the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 HD video for a few reasons. 1.

The video management software, Photo Fun Studio 5.1 only allows the user to clip out parts of the video. It does not even have a function for combining clips together. 3.

After many researches and testing of 2 other camcorder in $300 price range(Sanyo VPC-FH1A, Panasonic SDR-H100) I've decided to get a travel zoom type camera with good photo and video quality. And as long as photo is descent, I was mainly interested in better video quality.SX210+Pro+longer zoom+Bright Viewable video in low light with only 2candle on a table.+Excellent user control and menu and spinning control switch, I loved the menu and control.+I would say about 25% longer battery life+Manual focus option+Better flash light exposure/light handling+No motor noise during zooming in video.-Con-Soft/fuzzy lens. Not sure if unit I got was defective or all of them are alike, it is 1of2 main reason for not keeping Canon. General won't realize this unless you do a side by side comparison with a sharper image.-High noise video. Even in bright indoor lighting condition. The 2nd main reason for not keeping Canon-The weird...or lack of ergonomic design, which one can get used to with practice. Hard to operate with one hand.-Sound recording is lacking, when replayed on my pc, sound felt distend and tinny.-Highlights pink/magenta color.-Its got great flash exposure, produces nice looks flash photos, but in auto mode, it would lean to use longer exposure/higher ISO over flash...no idea why...ZS7+Pro+Beautiful video, the video is over processed, but video looks great.+Sharp lens, takes sharp photos and videos+Wider angle, and the i-zoom is very usable.+Great sound recording quality, what you hear is almost what you record.+Ergonomically friendly to handle with one or both hands.+When in full auto modeCon-Image is over processed...I really don't like it...look too unnatural to me, Even customization to tune everything down in setup does not help much. However, most general users will find the image beautiful, but that's because some of the details are gone, and colors are adjusted. A image taken of my wife with ZS7 will show her with smooth skin with light makeup, but when taken with SX210, you'll see the reality of wrinkles and no makeup. However same would apply if you want to take image to show detail...there will be no detail of fine scratches/fine dusts/fine particles...-Video taken with 2 candles, and background music in the room to emulate cake cutting, was very dark. However, if you can adjust the brightness and contrast on the player you use, you'll still be able to see most things that was captured by Canon. So the data is still captured...just too dark to be viewable.....wish this was adjustable in camera.-The menu control is not as innovative and easy to navigate as the Canon, is not bad, but can really see some improvement.-In auto mode, it leans towards using flashes....which does not offer as good as exposure when compared to Canon.In the end I kept the Panasonic and returned the Canon. It was a hard decision for me until I realized the fuzzy image Canon was producing, because I simply can't stand a fuzzy video or image. My wife is happy with the wrinkle removing feature...and I will revert to my DSLR if I wanted to take photos of greater detail. You will not notices the fuzzy images unless you pixel peep at 100%, it really doesn't matter to most users who print at 4x5.

I own a Casio 6MP EXilm which I was planning on upgrading, earlier I bought Nikon S6000 a few months back and returned it as its video quality in bright incandescent light was Horrendous. I then researched the Travel zoom category in detail. SX210 has a design flaw with flash popping up where you place your finger and no GPS, Casio FH100 although doesn't have GPS, thought was a tough competitor but you cant optically zoom in video (huge drawback) doesnt make sense to have long zoom when cant use it in video. didn't want to go back to Nikon s8100 with its video issues, but I am very impressed with its still picture quality and color reproduction (nothing compares to that). Samsung HZ35W the closest to ZS7 interms of features but I dont think its video quality is not as good as ZS7's in bright light. Then we have Sony HX5 probably has better lense than ZS7, especially regarding the purple streak issue that ZS7 has when pointed at bright light sources, but the image quality is not as sharp. I bought ZS7 for 199 and had it for few days now.Good : Great sharp pictures in bright light and also white light (florescent/tube) it automatically used ISO160. I was able to get nice depth of field in this point and shoot.Bad : but when it comes to incandescent (yellow) light it has some issues automatically uses atleast ISO400 gets little grainy. These issues are exaggerated in Video mode (not sure what happens with the video mode same issue with Nikon and Panasonic the screen automatically becomes a tad darker than it was in picture mode!!. Setting the AWB for incandescent light(auto white balance helped a little but does not alleviate the problem completely).Ugly : The s/w that came with it is horrendous, I still have to figure out how to download AVCHD lite videos to my computer with out the silly s/w (which I am planning on uninstalling) that was provided and also in which s/w I can play that, The manual is not a selling point either.The compromise : I had a previous bad experience with Panasonic with another electronic product I own, I seriously did not want to buy this brand. but as I mentioned earlier ZS7 did out run the others in the things I was looking for. I will experiment with it for few more days and then decide if I want to return.. but then what else is in the market that could beat this??????.

M.", "ReviewID": "R36DH2UMTWYKW9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera from a retail store just three years ago.It's very easy and fun to use, and with all it's features it readily takes good, sharp photographs.  The camera is small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, and I especially like the descriptive GPS information (i.e., \"San Francisco City Hall\") and other information that can be displayed on the viewing screen and later transferred to the photographs if desired.There are, however, a few drawbacks to be aware of:- the metal camera body is untextured and very slick and easy to drop, and so using the hand strap is a must;- in bright sunlight on a beach or snow-cover, it's literally impossible to see what is on the display screen in order to focus on or even see what you're trying to take a picture of (this is my first and only camera with a display screen, and this problem might be inherent in all cameras with a display screen);- it can be very disconcerting taking pictures at night, especially at a parade or other event with moving objects, as every time you move the camera every light source will smear and leave a bright, jagged trail across the display screen until you momentarily hold the camera stationary again (and this, too, might just be the nature of the beast for all display screens.)THE BIGGIE PROBLEM I saved for last:  this camera (and perhaps later versions as well) uses what I believe is Panasonic's own proprietary CD-installed software, called PhotoFunStudio, to download images from the camera to your PC.  This software also allows you to do a few very basic photo editing functions, including adding the date, time, GPS information, etc., to your photos and also then allows other photo editing software to be used to further refine your photos.However, the PhotoFunStudio software was written for older versions of Windows and might not work properly or at all with Windows 8.  When I try to install it on my brand new Windows 8 PC, I get a pop-up saying \"there was a problem installing this software and it might not work correctly\" (which, coincidentally or not, coincided precisely with the time I suddenly began to - and still do - have problems with my hitherto very reliable internet security software; I wonder if PhotoFunStudio corrupted my operating system, because complete uninstalls and reinstalls of my internet security system do not resolve the problems it now has.)I've been in contact with Panasonic customer service, and they were of absolutely no help; they said the software was written for an older version of Windows and might not work with Windows 8, but they are NOT going to update it.  When I asked if I can use my newly-purchased-from-Amazon Photoshop software (and rather expensive purchased user manual) in lieu of PhotoFunStudio to download photos from the camera, they said no, only PhotoFunStudio will work to download photos and to transfer display information (i.e., time, date, GPS) to them.  They suggested I try to install PhotoFunStudio in \"compatibility mode\" (which they didn't say how to do, and, me not being a PC person, I still haven't figured out how to do or found anyone who knows how to do) to see if that will work; that was the extent of their \"help\".So at this juncture, I don't know if I still have a fully functional camera, a semi-functional camera, or just a pretty expensive paperweight.  In any case, I resent Panasonic's utter indifference to this problem that will sooner or later affect every other owner of this camera as well, and thus I would not recommend this camera or any other Panasonic camera if they use PhotoFunStudio software.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Compact, yet powerful.", "Author": "Stephanie Rennells", "ReviewID": "RHOGNH15HJMH1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes pretty good quality pictures in both indoor and outdoor settings.

It did at one point have a speck of dust that would show up in pictures but I was lucky enough to have it shake out without having to do anything invasive on the camera.  So now I use a simple sandwich bag religiously to keep dust out and it does the trick.I specifically bought this camera for recording video at live music events.  The quality (HD) is excellent, has great zooming capabilities (crystal clear at 12X zoom) and the sound is usually great (minimal distortion by things like loud bass).

I can't really comment on the different manual settings because I'm not a skilled enough photographer to know what to do with the options.I initially bought an 8GB Transcend and an 8GB Sandisk SDHC memory card.  Both cards work fine for the HD videos. I've since upgraded to a 32 GB transcend card and never have to change the card/stop in the middle of a performance because of the storage.The battery life is almost perfect for recording HD for average 1.5 - 2 hr events (with stopping in between songs).  I always carry a spare battery and sometimes switch the battery at a convenient time anytime in the middle of an event and I'm fine for the rest of the night.I'm still very satisfied after a year and would recommend this to anyone looking to record good video!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "It just gets better and better", "Author": "H.

I went with this one after many reviews said ZS-10 was not as good as ZS-7 in picture quality.  Since then I take pictures indoor and outdoor using iA setting and the picture just came out great every time.  The zoom lens allow me to take creative protrait pictures with zoomed in as well as normal background.  I still have Sony DSC-W7 bought in 2005.  It still take great pictures and was highly recommanded at that time.  I can see the improvement of photograghy technology when I compare the two pictures side by side.  I think the Leica lens just beats the Carl-Zeiss lens hands down.  The video quality on ZS-7 is superior.  The icing on the cake is that I bought it for only $200, which is less than what I paid for DSC-W7.  I am sure I will enjoy it more and more after exploring all the options.  My next camera will have to be DSLR if I want to be more satisfied than with this one.Update: After borrowing my friend's ZS-10 and compared the same pictures taken at the same setting, I am glad I did not get the ZS-10.  Everybody could easily tell the picture quality of ZS-10 was worse than ZS-7 when the pictures were magnified.  Sorry for upsetting my friend.  I guessed the reason is the processing of image must cut corner in order to conserve the battery power given the new features added to ZS-10.

For the previous reviewer who has problem to view the video, K-Lite Codec Pack could help.The Fuji P&S; has less noise in lower light and better focus in macro. The package of Fuji 10x ones is smaller and more portable. This ZS7 is better in features and video quality.

I have a bigger Canon but wanted something smaller that would fit in my pocket or purse and still take good quality pictures.  At first I was going to buy another Canon brand camera because I was familiar with the interface, but read the reviews on the Lumix DMC-ZS7 and decided to go with it.  I also liked the zoom feature on the Lumix. I have not been disappointed in the quality of the pictures and the features.  And the interface has been easy enough to learn.  Some people might think this camera is a bit large or heavy compared to a pocket point and shoot, but I wanted something sturdy enough to hold onto.  The grip area makes it easy to hold onto. For me, it is a perfect combination of size and function.  Fits in my purse and takes great pictures with just the Intelligent Auto setting, but if you want to get more technical and customize settings, the Lumix gives you the ability to do that. The one downside is no printed manual.  I had to print off all 180 pages on 8 1/2 x 11 paper.  My Canon has a little instruction manual which I find handy to carry with me for reference.  But in all fairness, this is not a drawback unique to the Lumix.  Many cameras are coming sans instruction/user manual as a cost savings.  Also, the PhotoFun software could be better.

Fantastic battery life.  While on the road I was goofing off with all the scene settings. There are a total of 29 scene settings so you are covered no matter what the situation calls for. I am not a professional photographer in any sense, but I am a graphic designer with an eye for quality pictures. I have yet to see a camera whose end-result comes close to the ZS-7. I have played with most of the popular cameras available for sale here on Amazon and they don't come close. Of all the scenes I took pictures in, the only setting that the ZS-7 was not well equipped to handle was night-scenery. I tried to take pictures of the Miami beachfront and skyline. The water was invisible in the beachfront image and the skyline was very grainy and of low quality. Pictures taken indoors in complete darkness came out perfect however.  Another point I want to touch on is how \"quick to the draw\" this camera is. What I mean is you could turn the camera on and in literally under 2 seconds, this camera is ready to take pictures. The focus is also blazing fast. This was very helpful when, on the road, I saw an attraction that I wanted to capture and had only moments to do so before we passed it up. Not only that, I was able to take a high quality picture in under 4 seconds- no joke!Pros:-Long battery life-Many scene settings to choose from-12x zoom-Very quick to use-High quality picturesCons:-Night scenery photography-I've read many reviews about the monopoly Panasonic has on its batteries.

However, I have found that for flash pictures, to get the best result, set the dial to \"P\" (for Program mode) and then set the sensitivity (or ISO) to Auto.  That usually gives you good results for low-light situations.  You can also try the intelligent auto mode as well.  What is interesting in the playback mode, is that you can see what ISO that camera chose (whether you were in P (Program Mode) with Auto ISO selected or just Intelligent auto).  The key difference is that if you get a shot with a high ISO (like 800 or especially 1,000) the image will have more noise / grain.  In Program mode, you can choose an ISO of 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, and up, or you can also set it to 400 Max (which is the Max ISO that it will shoot at.  It's worth experimenting to get the best results.  If in doubt, start out in Intelligent Auto, but then switch the camera to P with ISO setting changed to Auto, and see if you get a different result.  Obviously in a dark room, you are going to get better pictures if you turn some lights on (that's always going to help and will allow for lower ISOs).  Hope that helps.  I've also noticed that the video is very good.  I'm pleased overall, but was even more so after I had done some additional experimenting in \"P\" program mode.  The wide lens is a plus too.  I recently took a shot of my daughter at her school assembly from a few feet away and was easily able to capture the entire group; while others were having to back up a few feet to get the entire shot, their puzzled looks at me made me chuckle, and I did say it must be the 25mm lens : )Good luck and I think you will enjoy this camera!", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Point and Shoot EVER!", "Author": "Judy Cook", "ReviewID": "R1NLCZNKTWKLUI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

The GPS feature sounds cool but I turned it off immediately as it offered me no added value.  The GPS uses a lot of camera battery power because it constantly uses the battery to check the position of digital photos, even when the camera is powered down.  I have not yet tried taking photos inside so I cannot speak to the camera's quality in this regard.  However, it had taken really good outdoor photos under a number of different circumstances.  I like that it is easy to use but still allows me to take manual photos under whatever circumstance pleases me.  The ZS7 allows you to take HD videos, which is not true of all cameras.  I found it easy to upload photos from the camera to my computer or an internet site.  The price for this camera was reasonable compared with other sites.One negative that I found with the ZS7 is that this camera only uses Panasonic batteries rather than AA batteries that you can purchase anywhere.

There is a small on and off switch so you don't have to turn the top to the setting you want and wait while it goes through them all, you can keep it on what setting you want and just switch it on.  The battery and memory card are together on the bottom out of sight instead of one on each side.  It shows how much battery life you have left, not just when it gets low and you have to guess.  It's obviously skinner.  The place where you tie on the arm string or neck string is on the side smooth with the camera not sticking out which is nice when trying to put it in a case.It's hard to hold it still when you have it zoomed all the way or close to all the way in and it's not recommended to zoom all the way in when it's dark, it's not the best in dark light but in comparision to old camera's, it's tons better.You have to switch between \"record\" and \"play\" mode on the back to view pictures or vid's you have taken, which in the end can be faster than hitting \"review\" on the old Kodak and hitting it again to go back to taking pictures.. it might be annoying in the beginning, but I like it better now that I am used to it.A problem I had in the beginning, on my old Kodak you could hold it halfway in and then take the picture for a better shot, you still can on this, but you have to push down harder on the button to take a picture, which messed me up a bit in the beginning, some pictures I were taking weren't really taking.I took 162 pictures and 4 video's equal to 11:35 minutes total and I only lost 2/3 (exactly, I watched it go down to 1/3) of the battery life.  I ended up being able to take 650 pictures and the video's before it started blinking.I'm not exactly fond of how it \"adds\" the pictures to my computer in one big folder with a weird name, but that's easily fixed by moving them and I'm sure I can fix it to start doing it differently.. but that's how it's auto set to do.I do notice pictures don't turn out really AT ALL in the dark, it's better to make a video and take a picture off of that to even bother trying to take a picture.  In the day time though, the picture quality is amazing, it's taken the best pictures I have ever taken.  The sound is amazing to, the concert I recorded sound like they are happening all over!  Great keepsake!So overall I give this camera 5 stars, but if you need a low light camera, this camera isn't for you, I knew going in it wouldn't do well, so I was prepared and don't think it needs docked stars for that, because the sound quality more than makes up for it.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "DMC - ZS7 - Lumix Camera", "Author": "Lori K. \"LK\"", "ReviewID": "R2SDC2LA3DZIJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a year before I bought this camera.

I did buy the AC adapter from Bestbatt(a much lower price) in anticipation of getting the coupler.  I called a dozen retailers to no avail.  I contacted my Japanese friend in Ontario who contacted her sister in Tokyo who bought the DC coupler (DMW-DCC5) from Amazon in Japan and airmailed it to me.  I now know why Panasonic stopped manufacturing this product.  After installing the coupler in the place of the battery and sliding open the little door to attach the AC adapter, the doorway is too small to allow the adapter to make a solid connection to the coupler.

While the GPS would include latitude and longitude, and pick-up (generally) the nearby city, it did not provide any location information at the Grand Canyon National Park, which surprised us and took too long to locate the satellites.The camera takes 720p video and it looks spectatcular.  Hard to belive such a small camera can take such vivid video.If I was doing this over, I might go for the ZS5 instead (without the satellite feature).  With the battery issue and time it take to locate the satellites (approx 3-5 min), its just not worth the hassle for the limited time you wish to use it.Our experience with zoom was that it loses quality as you increase the zoomx.  However, still OK.The software that came with our camera was PHOTOFUNstudio 5.1 HD Edition.  When we returned from the Grand Canyon, we had several hundred photos we loaded into our PC using this software.  However, we cannot view several hundred of the pics through the software, we have to go through explorer and use another program.

I am a freelance writer who also does photography to supplement some of my writing work. While I consider myself a writer more than a photographer over the years my photos have appeared in many articles and books including cover shots. I only point this out to show that I am not a rank amateur point and shooter or someone who cannot deal with manual controls or settings adjustments. I own a couple of Canon DSLRs and also a Canon S3 that I use when I want to travel light. The S3 is getting abit outdated and I hate the fact it uses AA batteries rather than its own rechargeable unit. Carrying a bundle of AAs and/or a charger for them is a nuisance with all the travel I do. I wanted a smaller camera with a rechargeable battery that could take quality photos as well as video. Having video is a plus for some of my website clients. Long story short, after studying the market and the reviews I chose the Lumix ZS7 for the Leica lens, variety of shooting modes and video quality. The long zoom was also a plus. I must say the video is excellent, but the quality of still photos is very inconsistent. I have tried a variety of settings and modes, but none can guarantee a high quality shot. The Intelligent Auto is anything but. I abandoned using it completely. Don't get me wrong, when it works, some of the photos are high quality, but most of the time, I'd rate them as average. Shooting indoors at auto shows, quality is average at best. Forget trying to focus in on a speaker during a presentation/demonstration. Many times photos are blurry because the camera is slow in writing to the memory card. And yes, I do use a high-speed pro quality memory card. My old 5megapixel Coolpix point and shot was way better. Bottom line, this camera is overrated and overpriced in my experience. It's too bad because it is of high quality build and a nice size, altho a bit hefty.

I'd say they rival HD camcorders and are way better than I expected.- The GPS tagging works flawlessly and is also better and much more than I anticipated.- The outdoor pictures are just mind blowing awesome, bright and beautiful.- The wide angle is also superb.- The superzoom works great even though the AF is slow - but completely acceptable to me.- It uses a Leica lens and has the same guts as the V-LUX 20.Now the only con, but a deabreaker:- The indoor pictures are horrible.

I really wanted something with more of a zoom than my old camera. I did not expect this camera to do well indoors or in low light, but I didn't realize how poorly it would perform in these situations. My 5 year old 4 megapixel Canon A520 produces better indoor photos than the Panasonic ZS7. I am not a photographic genius, however I do have a basic understanding of aperture, shutter speed and ISO. I am not opposed to playing with manual settings, but sometimes I just want to grab the camera and shoot in auto or P mode. I tried a variety of settings with the ZS7...I must've taken 500 pictures during the past week, just trying to figure out how to get it to produce an acceptable image indoors...a few of those 500 pictures looked pretty good, but it took way too much work to achieve that. I used it outside on a cloudy day, and those images were not great. I also used it outside on a sunny day, and those pictures turned out beautifully. If you're looking for a camera to be used strictly outdoors, then I think this camera is very good. Even with the zoom fully extended, the sunny outdoor pictures were really nice. However, I need a camera that does well in a variety of settings. The main subject of my photos is my family...kids, husband, dog, etc. This camera did not work well for me in that capacity. I tend to take most of my pictures outside, but do a fair amount indoors as well. I don't want to carry multiple cameras with me. I want one camera that is versatile. I do not expect DSLR quality photos, but I do want photos that are consistently adequate and sometimes exceptional, no matter what the setting. I am still searching for a camera that meets my needs. I'll stick with my A520 until I find something suitable (or until it dies on me!). I'm looking into the Canon S95 or Panasonic LX5 next...not much zoom, but I'll give that up for better image quality and versatility.Bottom line is, if zoom is truly important to you and you don't need something that easily produces decent indoor shots, you will probably be extremely happy with this camera.

When we got back, I was pretty disappointed with how many of the photos seemed to have some degree of blurring (yes, I wait until the viewfinder goes \"green\" before tripping the shutter).  This was not apparent to me on the camera display while I was taking the photos.So...I purchased this camera for a trip to Rome.  I'm happy to say that, when we got back and I could get our photos on a big monitor, they were quite nice.This is not the most \"user-intuitive\" point-and-shoot I've ever seen.  It does take awhile to get used to the controls, menus, and such.  But it is not insurmountable.  I use the \"auto\" setting for most of my shots, and it seems to do a pretty decent job in most situations.  The lens and optical zoom are both quite good.  I like the GPS feature--that was pretty cool to see on the Rome photos.  But get used to turning that feature off when you don't need it--otherwise, it is always on, even when the camera is off, which is a real battery-drainer.  Speaking of battery, you will need to recharge the battery daily if you're using this at all.  But charging does not take too long (2-3 hours?).Oh, I don't do videos much--never remember--but it does a decent job of those, too.

If you just want to view on the camera, your TV via UBS, or on your computer using the Panasonic software--you will have no issues.

It's not a replacement for a DSLR, but it allows me to capture photos that simply wouldn't be possible with lesser-quality compact cameras (or cell phone cameras).The lens has a 25mm-equivalent wide angle; this is incredibly useful, especially when walking in the city, shooting indoors at home, or taking group photos of family and friends.  It has a 300mm-equivalent at the telephoto end, which is fantastic for capturing wildlife or other distant subjects.  The macro capability is great for ultra close-ups.The movie mode is exceptionally good, and you might be surprised to know that it's actually superior to some of the newer cameras on the market.  Many of them don't allow you to zoom the lens while shooting in video mode, but the Panasonic lets you do that.  The stereo sound quality is excellent.  Panasonic really knows what they're doing when it comes to video.The quality of still images isn't as good as what you'd get from high-end compacts such as the Pansonic LX5, Olympus XZ-1, or Canon S100... but keep in mind that the ZS7's 25-300 lens allows you to capture subjects and scenes that those cameras' lenses wouldn't be capable of capturing.A wise photographer once said, \"The best camera is the one you have with you.\"  An expensive camera capable of stellar image quality doesn't do you any good if it's so big and heavy that you never want to bring it with you.

For many years we used a Nikon and have many travel photos hanging on the walls. But this is the first digital I ever owned. Would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in high quality images, ease of use and simple features. GPS system is nice also. When first bought I had to film some indoor scenes for business using HD recording. When played they were documentary quality like you might view on HDTV filmed by a professional camera crew; really sharp, with excellent sound. I am thankful for making, what turned out to be, a very good decision in buying this camera. I was reluctant since Panasonic did not seem to me to be a \"camera company.\" They have done a great job with the Lumix DMC-ZS7.

I used it when my nieces participated in a party game. I saved the photos I wanted and just deleted the ones I did not need. Oh, very important: get an SD card that has lots of memory so you won't have to stop taking photos just because you ran out of space. AND get a spare battery. Charge both batteries before taking the camera for long photo shoots.

Little \"Littleviews\"", "ReviewID": "R1K7YUEYWSU8GX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Lumix DMC-ZS7 in October 2010 and have taken at least 10,000 beautiful pictures with it. Unfortunately, I also dropped it hard three times while riding a bike (ooooooh), nicking the mode dial and I've used it in windy situations (oy!).Within the last few months, it periodically failed to focus. The problem was that grit entered the lens mechanism. I've since used a strong vacuum suction on the lens casing, which appears to have corrected the problem.The bottom line is that this camera has received very heavy use in all kinds of weather. I actually used it far more than my darling Nikon 5000, which I didn't think would happen when I purchased the Lumix. That said, because I always have need for a small camera, I recently bought a Lumix DMC-ZS8 from Amazon as a backup. It has a 16x optical zoom versus the ZS7's 12x, but it does not have the GPS (which is *very* handy), or stereo audio that the ZS7 has.No matter what, the non-touch screen Lumix cameras are truly fabulous. Easy? My 6 year old granddaughter takes professional-quality pictures with it (I'm so proud). My only tip is to periodically vacuum the lens casing, especially after a day at the beach.BTW, many Lumix models now have touch screens. As I prefer one-handed shooting, touch screen cameras are not handy for me. Also, I am not sure how a touch screen would respond if it was accidentally slammed against the ground (always a possibility with a small camera). You'll have to find another reviewer's experience for that.If you are interested, you can see some of my photography with this camera on littleviews.com and letsKickScoot.com.

Also, the file type for the HD movies, m2ts, I need to learn more about. I haven't found out how to playback movies yet, but it was easy to figure out how to see the pictures I'd taken, deleting, managing them, etc. I do recommend getting familiar with this camera in advance of using it. I went to a large horse show without really trying it out and that was a mistake. I missed a lot of photo opportunities. I also recommend getting an SDHC card with a high capacity of GBs and speed. I ordered a Transcend 8GB Class 10 card so the camera can write to it quicker. I will need to get a larger GB card if I plan to take a lot of movies. This camera is excellent for movies and pictures so I will not need to buy a separate movie camera as I only take short clips. Also, I love the red color.

I haven't tried indoor photos with flash, perhaps these would come out better.There several problems that I found with indoor and other low-light shooting, at low ISO setting the exposure takes too long, unless subject is completely stationary, the pictures come out smudged.  Particularly with children, I've taken quite a few photos where child would completely leave the frame during the exposure, leaving behind a ghost trail.With high ISO setting, the pictures are too grainy, and I think they suffer from very aggressive JPEG compression - at least this what it looks like to my eye.  And indeed, the size of the compressed 12M-pixel files seems too small to allow good quality.  I have camera set to highest quality compression setting, and apparently it still compresses too much.Another big minus, is long shutter lag, when shooting moving subjects pre-focusing is essential.  if you forget to pre-focus, chances are the moment will be lost before camera finally reacts.I am also not thrilled with physical design, looks and feels far clunkier and bulkier, than even ancient Canon Elph designs from 5 years ago.One thing that I like design-wise is a separate button for shooting video, so I can instantly switch b/n video and photo without tinkering with controls or menusWith all the drawbacks, I still plan to keep this camera for what it does well - outdoor photos.Oh, BTW, I think that GPS feature is rather annoying (or rather distracting) than useful... if I had an option to get same camera without it, I'd take it.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome video capabilities!!", "Author": "Alex E.C. \"Music and movies\"", "ReviewID": "RIKW14NPUDODV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm going to be short and direct.1.- The video quality is spectacular the zoom and autofoucs is incredible!!,10 stars to hd video and zoom and autofoucs.2.

I've carried other cameras in my pocket for years without any problems due to dust particles getting into the lens assembly.Update 01/21/2013 There is still loads of dust in the lens assembly but it turns out it's dust on the sensor that was causing the blotches on my photographs.

I gave the go ahead and was then advised it had water damage, (not possible) and it was not economic to repair but for a further $80 they would send it back to me!It is well known, that most manufacturers design and build their products with the aim of them only lasting just beyond the warranty so that you then have to buy a new one. This is pure exploitation of the consumer and governments should step in to make it illegal. I might as well have bought a disposable camera for around $10.Hopefully with consumer pressure, Amazon could collate feedback on how long a product will last, and whether it can be economically repaired.

As there are very few point and shoot GPS cameras, I really only had three to consider seriously.  I chose this one because the other two on my short list produced images that looked heavily processed straight out of the camera.  The GPS is very good and accurate, once it takes its very sweet time to locate where it is.  A recent trip to Lisbon, it took the camera nearly 36 hours and a heavy drain on the battery to determine that it was, in fact, in Lisbon.  But once it figured it out, the GPS worked perfectly.  This is also a problem when traveling shorter distances as well.  Think you can drive to a town two hours away and the camera can just be picked up and the GPS will have determined location?  Not always.  So, since I was purchasing this camera primarily as a GPS camera, I am a little underwhelmed by its capabilities.  If you don't want a GPS, you  can get far better picture quality on a Cannon point and shoot for about half the price so I wouldn't bother with this camera if you don't want the GPS.  Image quality is a much bigger problem here than any of my other point and shoots, even those several years old.  The long range zoom is a great marketing device but picture quality goes down significantly when zooming even half of this camera's range.  Low light photos are worse than on my $89 Cannon.  HD Video?  Essentially another marketing ploy.  The video is fine for email and social network sharing but falls very short of being anything you'd be proud to show on a TV screen of 30 inches or more. Video on the iPhone 4 is better.  So, I gave this three stars just because, to my knowledge, this is the best point and shoot camera with a GPS.

So, if you are in an activity, such as fishing, and changing position rapidly, you need to carry your hand-held GPS and use software, such as GeoSetter (free), that will sync your hand-held unit GPS position with your camera time.  In other words, ignore the GPS coordinates recorded by the camera.

Does this carry all of 10 feet?  I sincerely doubt it.Third, the lag.  Having found out the hard way that the flash pictures aren't very good, I turned it off to use it with natural lighting.  I have a new grand-daughter, and she doesn't sit still.  Even as an infant she can out maneuver this camera.  While I am hurriedly trying to get her to look at me I push the button, and by the time the camera figures out what to do, I have another picture with her in half the frame.Fourth, the color of these pictures look dull.  Now granted I purchased this one with the anticipation of being able to use it as a cheap substitute for my Nikon SLR.  When I take pictures with this one and compare the color to a shot taken virtually at the same time with the Nikon, there is a world of difference.Finally, I would say that my wife's little $100 Canon outshines this camera.  The color is far brighter, the flash actually does work within that magic 10 foot area and it's a smaller, sleeker design.So if I can't convince Amazon to overlook the fact that I've now owned this thing for a couple of months, with most of that time, sitting gathering dust, I will either give it away to some unsuspecting slob or donate it.  I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone who has an inkling about photography.  You will be highly disappointed as I am.Thanks for reading my rant.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do NOT buy this camera", "Author": "R Francescone", "ReviewID": "R23MMN08PMACTR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do NOT buy this camera.

Here are my opinions about Panasonic Lumix ZS7 ;Product quality is above avarage, Leica emblem on the left corner looks cool and also Leica lens seems huge, so it's all about Leica not Panasonic :P the buttons backside are little bit small sometimes hard to use and also zoom ring upside is not solid. 3 inches 460000 dots screen is very shiny and colorful, i like it very much. But don't look for a eye-catching desing like Sony, when you get your camera out of its case anybody says wow :) when they use it that's the time when wows come :DSize of the camera is acceptable, it was hard to find stylish case for this size but it's way to small for 12x optical zoom monster. When you cover the body you know it is at the safe hands, Pana did make a good job here also.Usage of the camera is the best part i think. Manuel controls (i think it's semi-manuel) works like a charm at the limits of photo quality. iAuto mode is really cool feature, it always makes good job. But play switch at the back panel is too annoying, everytime you have to switch it and it is too weak, i dislike it. User Interface is way to easy for everyone, you can easily set the right settings and shoot. Quick menu also helps you about setting iso, pic size and much more in a quicker way.Picture quality is much worse then i anticipated :( i guess it's all about the sensor size and pixel density. Before i bought this cam i read that ZS3's picture quality was good enough, i decided to buy that cam but when i saw ZS7 price is only 20 boxes higher than ZS7, i bought ZS7. I thought that 10MP or 12MP does not make such differance but it does. There is no way you can shoot quality pictures at low light. You have to take pics at longer shutter times but that causes blurry pics. If you set iso to 800 or above this time you get noises. Who wants to carry tripod with that size of machine. Also daylight pics are too dim, i got disappointed with cameras pic quality :(Video quality saves this product, it's too smooth, zooming also too smooth. When taking video zooming becomes slow,i guess that decreases the sound level of the lens engine and also decreases camera shake. But there is a problem i can not find the way pausing a video when recording. There is no introduction at the manuel, i pressedall the buttons but i can't do it.Battery life is good. I can take about 300 pics, and 30 min of video. I have 4GB class 10 SDHC card and it's the limit of the card maybe with a bigger card you can take more i don't have any idea. GPS feature is useless for daily picturing i think, but there is an airplane mode so it spends less battery power.And last in the original box neither case nor memory card included. That's too disappointing, you are buying 400$ priced camera with 16mb internal memory and HD video capturing and you can not take picture or video without buying a memory card yourself.Summary don't buy this kind of product, if you want manuel controls buy something like canon g11, s90 or pana G1, in a compact it is useless, if big sizes is not problem for you go for nikon d5000 or canon rebel ti1 (eos 500D), if you want a small and HD camera go for canon sd780IS (ixus 100) or canon sd1400IS (sd1400is), both two have same sensor size, 100$ cheaper and really small sizes with cool colors and stylish body :D", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "Jerry Lee Gothong \"just jerry\"", "ReviewID": "R1XU05VI0I0YP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is extremely user friendly.

I've also found that the red eye reduction is so bright and delayed that it causes my girls to squint and I end up getting squinty eyed pictures.

My wife beat me to the front door when the UPS guy rang the bell but when she picked up the box the camera almost fell onto the concrete path in front of the door.Now how can this happen? you may well ask, the shipping box from Amazon was barely bigger than the actual camera box providing little or no padding and protection. As if that was not bad enough the really outrageous thing was that the shipping box was closed by a fold-in flap at each end that had NO TAPE OR GLUE TO SECURE IT. One flap was completely open and when my wife picked it up the inner camera box almost fell out, she just caught it in time. I called Amazon immediately to complain, the agent was very apologetic and advised me to send a message using a new feature that lets you communicate directly with Amazon shipping. I sent an appropriately curt message with pictures, I will let you know if anything happens.Now to the camera, it looks like a very nice camera but once again the Mfg. has done some crazy things that should get the development engineer and the micro brained marketing people FIRED.Panasonic provides an external battery charger, which is nice and convenient until you realize that there is NO WAY to charge the battery while the battery is in the camera or to power the camera from an external source while the battery is in the camera. Well what's wrong with that you say, well what if you want to do something really far out such as display photos or play a video on an HD TV. If the Battery runs down then you have to stop the show while you remove the battery and recharge it.Ah! said I there is a USB connector surely the camera can be powered from this like so many other devices, NO YOU CANNOT POWER THE CAMERA FROM THE USB CONNECTOR. Now I delve into the manual, there appears to be some sort of DC power connector which plugs into the camera but how. I call tech support and spend a fruitless hour talking to someone who has nothing but a very basic understanding of the camera (or anything else for that matter, I had to explain the difference between AC sand DC) but I did find out that there is something called a DC coupler cable that COUPLES the camera to SOMETHING (the tech. person was not sure what it coupled to). Tomorrow I am supposed to get a call from a supervisor who knows more.I started searching the Panasonic site and other sites for some information, here is what I found.There is an optional device which can power the camera from external AC power, it consists of a DC power source and a plastic box that is the same size as the battery, you remove the battery and insert this box in its place. A cable from the DC power source plugs into a connector at the bottom of the plastic box which then connects to the battery input pins inside the camera. What a total screwup.The battery and DC connector are on the bottom of the camera it is therefore impossible to stand the camera on its base while this abortion is in use, neither can you attach the camera to a tripod because the connector gets in the way.I am not finished with this sad story, after a lot of searching I found what appears to be the part # for this contrivance and what appears to be a list price of, WAIT FOR IT -------- $79.99. BUT, with more searching this does not appear to be the correct device even though it was described as the DC COUPLER FOR A DCM_ZS7. Pictures of the device in no way correspond to the functionality of  the DC COUPLER.What the hell does Panasonic think it is doing, even if you get the right DC COUPLER it is still powered by AC, there appears to be no way to recharge the battery or power the camera from a car adapter. All Panasonic had to do was to tap into the USB connectors 5 V supply and all problems would be solved, if they were concerned about charging the battery from the USB power they could have easily just allowed the camera to be powered by the USB. What is going on?This may be a deal breaker for me.Before I got this ZS7 I had tried the Samsung TL240, another terrific camera that is until I discovered its fatal flaw. The TL240 could be powered and recharged from the USB power supply, Hallelujah, however the TL240 had a strange HDMI port. I had called Samsung about this as their literature was very vague about it, \"it's a standard MINI HDMI port\" they said \"you just need a standard MINI to full size HDMI cable\" they said, they lied.When I got the camera I saw immediately that the HDMI port was TINY and in no way could a mini HDMI fit into it so called them, they knew NOTHING about this problem but suggested I call their parts suppliers and ask for a part # they gave me, they provided 2 phone numbers (samsung-parts and J & J International). Neither outfit had any knowledge of the part # or any HDMI cable for the TL240. J & J said that there were probably none in the country they might be in KOREA. I called Samsung back again, they had NO idea what to do or when they might have the cables or what they would cost.I returned the camera.Is it me, am I expecting too much or do these companies employ idiots in their marketing departments, NO it must be me.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great while it worked", "Author": "Ty Davison", "ReviewID": "R7AVPQ7RIC4I1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had the predecessor to this camera, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3, which like the ZS7 featured a 12x Optical Zoom that really \"made\" the camera. I found the camera to be slightly unintuitive at times, but the picture quality was quite good in most cases and the 12x zoom was marvelous for capturing close-ups that my other point-and-shoots (with 4x optical zooms) couldn't get.Unfortunately, the camera stopped working about 6 months after purchase. I sent it to Panasonic for repair and was told that the lens was dented. How this happened during normal usage I have no idea, because I take very good care of my equipment and it was never subject to any sort of drop or abuse. The camera worked, I turned it off, it never turned back on. Essentially, I paid a lot of money for a device that worked well for about 6 months, and Panasonic's refusal to live up to their end of the warranty coverage has me strongly doubting that I'll ever buy from them again.I have no doubt that the ZS7 is a product capable of producing lovely images just as the ZS3 was. I have no confidence that Panasonic will stand behind it or any of their other products should something go wrong.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "The unexpected", "Author": "khalid", "ReviewID": "R3M7VDPEXL5CTI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After a long research, I selected this camera for its zoom and picture quality.

PhotoFunStudio 5 HD Edition requires that you either select the photos you choose to download one by one, or that you select all of them. Now, if you're like me and you take hundreds of pictures and several movies at one time and you choose not to clear your memory card, this can be a big problem. If you select the \"All\" option the software does not remember which movies have already been downloaded and automatically creates a copy of them in each folder, right next to the original. Unless you clear your memory card this will go on forever until your hard disk is full of useless copies of movies which you will have to delete manually, one by one. Even when you select the photos you would like to download, the software still decides to download all the movies all over again and save them as copy 2, 3, 4 and so forth, in each folder. In addition, the download time is awfully slow.I'm used to my old Canon Powershot software, ZoomBrowser EX. First of all, it gave me the option to download only the new photos, those that had not been previously downloaded, and secondly after clicking the OK button it was a matter of seconds and voila, all done! Unfortunately ZoomBrowser does not recognize the Panasonic movie format, so it downloads only images, otherwise I would be using that. Now I have to use ZoomBrowser for the photos and then go back manually and download the movies with PhotoFunStudio. What a pain! I miss Canon's easy of use very much and unless Panasonic makes some much needed updates to Photo NOT SO MUCH FUN Studio 5 HD Edition, I will definitely go back to Canon.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7", "Author": "rasty", "ReviewID": "R3S1OWHZLJTH2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.

The camera I bought is for residential, non professional use. However it does take professional quality pictures, as well video's. Of the 15 minutes short take variety. Honestly I should have known better than to think moreso. I do apologize for missing that point. The battery in the camera, works just fine for the SHORT LENGTH VIDEO it does take... and without any troubles. KUDO'S!2) I am still not happy that I cannot hook up to AC Power with it. The battery is it. Some have said buy a second battery, well that's a gimmie now. I will indeed.3) Further study, this camera zoom in STILL \"IN MY OPINION\" not all its cracked up to be, in fact, the Kodak V seriees Zoom beats the hell out of any I have seen thus far. Mind you what I said \" of any I have seen\". And I have not seen ALL camera zoom ever made. But of the many I have seen, Snieder Lenses RULE in zoom and clarity.3) The camera does in fact take Feature Film Quality photo's as well video. And again I state the slower moving controllable zoom makes keeping the images in focus from A to Z much better. I would love to see them work on this factor some more.I like the Camera, but I do not LOVE the camera. The V-610 Kodak far outweighs any digital compact I have seen or used since. I miss that camera big time. But this one is absolutely my 2nd choice.Always Nicholas in SeattleOkay, well I am a Filmmaker-Director-Producer- avid photographer throughout my lifetime thus far... 50 years alive and counting...I've been taking pictures since I was 7 years of age. Reported to be one of thee greatest natural photographers in history. Not my personal opinion, but rather thee opinion of professionals in the related field.In using the camera mentioned herein I have found a few things... see them as you like, but these are \"my personal experiences\" thus far...I purchased this camera brand New through Amazon weeks ago. It is now December 23rd 2010 SO early December it was purchased....#1) The camera is not even remotely \"user friendly\". I am constantly referring to the manuals to try and figure out \"how to\" do things with it.#2 ) My greatest PEEVE or disappointment with this camera are two things, 1, it does not seem to have an AC POWER SUPPLY, and one most certainly DID NOT COME WITH the camera in the box. I assume I will have to pay YET MORE for that feature, IF that feature even exists with this camera ??? I will have to RESEARCH MORE IN THE MANUAL to learn this ... and 2, when I plug my camera into my computer to view or download pictures or video's... the computer does not charge the camera at the same time LIKE OTHER FAR LESS EXPENSIVE CAMERAS DO. ( GEEZE with ALL I paid for this ONE WOULD THINK I would at least have something the CHEAPEST CAMERS OUT THERE HAVE??? HELLOOOOOO !!!)#3) When I was trying to get my Camera \"interior memory items\" into my computer, it was almost impossible to find out HOW TO TRANSFER from internal memory to disc or hard drive.#4) When I take pictures, there are so many settings on the dial to choose from, and NONE OF THEM ARE CLEARLY MARKED AS \"TYPICAL OR NORMAL\" settings ( again LIKE MOST CAMERAS HAVE ). So I cannot tell what the NORMAL EVERYDAY picture taking mode IS ?????#5) When I take a picture, they are rarely SHARP. And that PROBABLY stems from my lack of KNOWLEDGE regarding WHICH PICTURE TAKING MODE I am SUPPOSE to be in. ???#6) The BRAGGED ABOUT 16X ZOOM feature.... is NOT all it is bragged up to be. I had a Kodak V610 compact digital, which I must say had THEE GREATEST ZOOM and LENSE CLARITY of ANY camera I have seen since. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME... I dropped it into SALT WATER on accident, and that split second of submerging cost me the life of that amazing camera. While I was bragging it up, a friend told me that Panasonic made a better lens and zoom. So that is why I bought the DMC-ZS7, but I can tell you pointedly, the lens IS NOT AS GOOD AS the Kodak V610 by any stretch of ones imagination. Nor is the ZOOM even REMOTELY CLOSE to the one in my old V610. Ohh well, learn from our mistakes I guess...Video wise however....The video mode of this camera is awesome ONCE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT, *Ugh* I LOVE the clarity of the video, and I especially LOVE the ability you have to CONTROL THE ZOOM IN AND OUT \"\"\"SPEED\"\". Which is CRITICAL to GOOD VIDEO FOOTAGE. Focus at the slowest controllable speed is outstanding.I give HUGE KUDO's for that ability.I would suggest that Panasonic/Lumix take focus on making the SPEED OF ZOOM even MORE EASILY controllable, which will enable the shooter to capture consistent STELLAR videography, or video production.Thats all for now. Possibly more later as I dig deeper into the camera's abilities, in attempts to Master this device.Always Nicholas in Seattle", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Battery does not work!?", "Author": "bigfansue \"bigfansue\"", "ReviewID": "R29V2INTT8160V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first one I purchased right here on Amazon worked fine with my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7.
