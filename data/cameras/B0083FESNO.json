We have done so much with it on our vacation in just 2 days that it's already justified the purchase. No issues with leaking and I've taken it all over Discovery Cove and done underwater pics and movies. No regrets here!

Couldn't wait to use it snorkeling!  On the third day of our vacation, before our snorkel excursion, while in the water with my family, I had a \"Memory Card Error\". The camera wouldn't take a picture, even though this was a brand new memory card.  I got out of the water, dried the camera off completely and opened the door to the memory card and found my memory card to be wet.  Needless to say, the memory card was ruined and I had no others with me. For the rest of my Caribbean vacation, I had no pictures. I called Fuji and was told to return the camera and memory card and both would be replaced.  After waiting 5 weeks, I received the same exact camera back and was told that it was tested and found to be \"fine\". I then put the camera into a bowl of water for 20 minutes and once again, found water inside the door of where the memory card goes.  I then called again and was told I probably had water on my hands that got into the camera when I opened it.  I was told to send it back once again to have it tested.  But if it was found to be \"fine\" again, it would be sent back to me.  I then returned the camera to the store where it was purchased and got my money back.  DO NOT buy this camera!!! This was a horrible experience and I would NEVER buy a Fuji again.  The Service/Repair department and rude and tell you whatever it is they think you want to hear.  If you do buy this camera, don't assume it is waterproof, because it just might not be!!", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pictures not as sharp", "Author": "Gregory J Honeycutt", "ReviewID": "R2B20SU4HKNHF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have noticed that quite a few of my photos aren't quite as sharp as I would like them to be.

On our 1st beach vacation it worked fine after getting splashed by sea water, except that the latches became stiff to open and close. This was in spite of rinsing it off with fresh water and allowing it to fully dry before opening it. However on our second beach vacation, after still working fine in the surf getting splashed for the 1st 3 days, I decided to get some underwater photos of my sons snorkeling while I was standing holding the camera about 12 inches under the water. I double checked the latches prior to this. It took about 15 seconds of video then stopped working. After allowing it to dry completely it came back on. However it vibrates on its own, the flash goes off on its own, and everything looks blue. Fortunately nothing on the flash card was lost, but I had downloaded the photos and videos daily as a precaution anyway. Do not buy this camera. I will start searching for another. I wasted my money as it is too late to return it.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "Ahmad", "ReviewID": "RK7JVV69CT7EO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing AF.

What a POS!! took video and pictures in water, beach etc (picture quality is ok - bit washed out).On the 2nd day - the camera was in my bathing suit pocket in the pool.  pulled it out to take a video and some picture - got a few shots off then \"Memory Card Error\" came across screen. turned it off and on - still got the error message.  Then it would not shut off at all.  had to take out battery and memory card.  I notice that they were a little wet, and then I saw condensation on the lenses and lcd screen.. GAME OVER.even though there are 2 locks on this camera, and one can not be closed without the other being latched - it still leaked.I just returned my camera, or will have to use Credit Card protection.  I don't want Fuji to repair this - if it breaks after 2 days of use... I have no faith the company will give me a camera that last.  not fun to have your camera die during your trip.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "All Terrain", "Author": "maso", "ReviewID": "R3KHT6OI1ZJ6MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very reliable for all risk activities with and without water.

I want a full refund or a replacement camera!The camera worked great.  I was very happy about it.  But I was well aware of other reviews and instances where the camera failed users when it was submerged under water.  In my situation, my boyfriend submerged the camera to take underwater photos, about 2 feet, but no more!  This was for no more than 20 minutes.  The camera light was green, and he tried to turn on the camera and take a picture, instead, the camera flickered with quick static (like old TV static) and the camera would not turn on.  He couldn't tell if it turned on and off, or if it just wouldn't turn on.  Back on the boat, he noticed the camera light was then red.  From then on, he was unable to turn it on!This is so frustrating given all the hassle I went through for it! (see below) When he got home, I opened the battery/SD chamber and water trickled out of it.  I removed the battery and SD card, and they were moist.  Even after patting the inside of the chamber water  still dripped out when I shook the camera.  I don't have a hair dryer, not to say that would be a safe way of drying the camera, so I will wait until tomorrow for the sun to come out to completely dry it before I put the battery and SD card back in again.Issues with entire camera experience:Aside from the functionality of the camera, I ordered this camera for a two-day delivery so I can receive it before I left the country.  (I moved overseas to a country where it's not so easy to ship things.)  Based on the guaranteed shipping time, I would have received it on time.  To my luck, UPS had a shipping delay due to bad weather and the camera never came.  I purchased the camera online because it saved me $35.  I could have purchased a similar but lower model at Costco for $179.  Instead, I had to pay an additional $70 to have the camera shipped to Central America.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.95", "Features": "14MP CMOS\nHigh Quality Fujinon 5x Optical Zoom Lens\n4-Proof Protection: Waterproof 33', Shockproof 6.5', Freezeproof 14*, Dustproof\nFull HD Movies\nInnovative Wireless Image Transfer function", "Name": "Fujifilm XP170 Compact Digital Camera with 5xOptical Zoom Lens - Orange", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qp0f84EXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0083FESNO"}}
