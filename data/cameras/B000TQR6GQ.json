{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "Kimberley", "ReviewID": "R3SJ9SU009XPNI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 5 year old nephew and it was a complete waste of money. You would think that for $40 the camera would be decent, but you'd be wrong. The box is closed on the back, so in the store you can't see how big the LDC preview screen is, and once you open it you find that it is only about an inch big. Then once you turn the camera on, you find that the preview image is horrible. The image, if you can even call it an image, is blurry and grainy and completely undecipherable. For a camera that is marketed towards children who thrive on instant gratification, it fails to deliver and is useless. My nephew took one picture, saw that he couldn't see the picture, and never touched the camera again. Do not waste your money on this camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Waste of Smiles, batteries and the crayola name", "Author": "Peter J. Lakers \"plakers\"", "ReviewID": "R5YWWRIIKC6SS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst toy ever bought by us. And Crayola had the guts to put thier name on it. Despite what others say the software is even worse than the camera(some people claim the camera is worse). I took too long to complain as my son just loved snapping pictures but didn't care that when I downloaded them you could not see what they were about. The shutter moves too slow so everything is blurry, and the flash comes on too late so everything is overexposed. Crayola has forwarded my complaint to the manufacturer but I am certain they too knew it was C-R-A-P to begin with.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Crayola Camera", "Author": "Joy Galvan \"Joy Galvan\"", "ReviewID": "R2VBD48FAKXLAM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera was low quality, you can not even see the picture you have taken it always comes out blurry.

He loves it. Yes, the preview screen is small but it works well in good lighting. Yes the preview screen is dark when you are in a darker environment. Yes, the flash does overexpose the picture when you are in a darker environment.With all of that said - that's what you get when you pay $40 for a digital camera. This camera has the highest pixels of any childrens digital camera that I know of. When I uploaded pictures from his first day of using the camera there were 60 some odd pictures. I was able to get 10 good shots out of those. That's ok by me because it's a children's camera, it's not my expensive camera.So I am satisfied with my purchase and my son loves it.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it.", "Author": "DG", "ReviewID": "R359KK52QFXQEG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It never worked or even turned fully on.

Spent $30 for it at BJ's Wholesale, kept it for a birthday gift, and within 2 months of use it fritzed out. The viewfinder is terrible - the pics are awful - and it sucks brand-new batteries dry after 5-10 minutes of use. I contacted Crayola, and they basically shuffled me off to the manufacturer Sakar Intl. No follow-up as of yet.Bottom line: DON'T BOTHER.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't bother!", "Author": "COMom", "ReviewID": "RLADFNOX3QG5O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't bother wasting your money on this product.  I bought this for my kids last Christmas and it broke within a week.  The button to press to take pictures got jammed and I was unable to unjam it, so it is completely useless.  Plus, the small screen was tiny and you can barely make out the image and the picture quality was so bad....to be a joke.
