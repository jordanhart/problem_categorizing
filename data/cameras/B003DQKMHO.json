Matot \"GMS\"", "ReviewID": "R3P8Q825G2ZPGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So this is an easy and somewhat rugged point-and-shoot camera. I got this model for a river raft trip on the Colorado River where exposure to water and sand was likely. It never did get soaked but that gave me piece of mind. I would not test it in the ocean on your vacation.Pros: small size - smaller than a pack of smokes, ease of use, simple settings, reliable, waterproof (perhaps), takes SDHC cards, easy to conceal, includes wrist strap, has some special effect shooting modes, self timer, macro mode, tripod mountable. Tiny size and smooth rounded corners means it fits and carries in your pocket just fine and slides out quickly for a fast shot. Shoots decent standard def video too, a few steps above VHS quality video but with poor low lite video performance.Cons: rechargeable battery (can go dead when needed most but with AA's you pop in new ones and re-start shooting in seconds), viewfinder only on LCD display - sunlight washes out any hope of seeing what you are shooting, a little slow to process, digital zoom - not optical means any zoom reduces picture quality, small size makes it harder to hold steady, LCD forces you to hold at eye-ball height with makes for some awkward shots. And it plays the stoopid Fuji sound each time you turn it on which makes it harder to take stealth photos.So I also own an expensive Canon camera but bring this along on vacations instead because it doesnt take up much room, isn't a target of thieves - looks like a tiny cheap camera, waterproof means it survives the change from a cold dry hotel room to a humid outdoors with minimal risk of condensation damage. When viewing images on the computer, after the 2nd click to zoom into the 10mp images they start to pixel on the 3rd zoom-in click - but that also means the images are going to be in the range of 4-5mb each. I think Fuji has discontinued this model. All in all this is a good performer at a really decent price. I have not had any regrets buying it and unlike my $900 Canon, this one has never failed to perform and has never disappointed. For a shot with flash, from the time you press the power button until it is ready to shoot with flash is in the realm of 3-4 seconds. From shoot to ready to shoot again with flash off is in the realm of 4-6 seconds. If Fuji were to come out with an updated camera with more mp, I would order it today, perhaps I should go look!", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love my new camera!", "Author": "Alex Greenberg", "ReviewID": "R1NU93SSPPP8VF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a nice little camera this is!  I take pictures whenever I go Kayaking ( or any outdoorsy thing ), and I've already killed a nice point-n-shoot.  I keep my Fuji around  my neck on a lanyard and squeeze off shots when I feel like it.  No more plastic bags, no more fumbling around in my drypack for a picture which won't wait.Picture quality is fine.  10mp, decent zoom, farly bright screen but what the heck, I got because it's rugged.Highly recommended! Perfect for out on the water.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Survived 5 Hours in a Pool", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "RO4GZUYWK1IO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had one of these for 2 years now and it's an awesome camera.  It's taken excellent pictures (especially when backpacking up in the mountains) and has been used in and under the water countless times.  Recently I was at a water park and the camera came out of my pocket and fell to the bottom of the pool.  They wouldn't shut the slide down for me so I had to wait over five hours until the park closed; once I got the camera back it still works EXCELLENTLY.

It had a great digital zoom that got me DSLR quality macros. It also had a great action scene that shot crisp pictures at 70MPH. I had it submerged in a mountain creek for some awesome underwater shots. Unfortunately, it met its end in Destin, FL when the water leaked into the battery case. It still works, but the LCD is gone. My girlfriend has the upgraded model, I must put it through some tests to see how it measures to my old Z33.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "small and portable", "Author": "Shawn Blaesing-thompson \"Abby's Mom\"", "ReviewID": "RFNV2OL61E8U6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this is a second camera for banging around out side with the kiddos.
