{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great images for me.", "Author": "Major Tom", "ReviewID": "R2LAWY5L3NUO2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm baffled by the other reviews, but this isn't the first time a consumer electronic device has worked great for me but received poor marks from other buyers.  Heaven forbid I accuse any other person of operator error, but I entertain the possibility that maybe things work well for some but not for others, without necessarily being defective by design.  Also, megapixels aren't everything.I don't need to qualify myself as a super-competent photographer with tons of really expensive gear, because you don't care.  You might even prefer to hear that I'm an incompetent photographer, given my success with this camera, as evidence that this one is easy to use.Because, regardless, the camera's function is great.  I have taken images of moving animals, scenes at dusk, done some astrophotography, used the 1cm macro function extensively to photograph stuff I was selling, etc. etc.  I've put it through its paces, and compared captured images directly with those taken by other cameras I use, and am impressed with the quality this one puts out.  Sensor and optics: great.  Interface: great.  Form factor and electronics: great.  Zoom feature for a camera this size: bonus!  Many of the controls are easy and intuitive.  Where they aren't, there are several different ways to save capture settings.  No, this camera doesn't introduce inordinate noise into your images.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio RZ10", "Author": "MarekP", "ReviewID": "R10QU4E3F612F8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera just few days ago but I had a full weekend to test it. Overall I like it however it has some minor disadvantages. First of all I must say that I am a PENTAX user, I used to use PENTAX MZ-7 (analog SLR camera with zoom 28-300 mm)  and right now I also use PENTAX K100D Super,  RZ10 is my second camera for quick  shots and travels.RZ10 has very extensive menu that allows using automatic mode (I do not recommend) and P-program mode in which you can choose all important settings you wish (WB, ISO, brightness, saturation, format (4:3, 19:6), resolution, ect.  The most critical for this camera is ISO which above 400 gives quite a lot of grains (I do not recommend  use above 400).Zoom is excellent, very quick and precise; a color pallet gives a natural projection. HD movies are really nice but the microphone is too sensitive picking up the wind noise too much.It is maybe because I used it very extensively throughout the weekend but battery last only one day of shooting approximately 200 pictures.All in all I like it, since pictures in daylight are very natural, menu gives a good selection of different settings, and zoom is precise (x10).", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "william", "ReviewID": "R30FWF4QII6C8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have bought several Pentax digital cameras.

I am not a photographer nor am i interested in becoming one so my first criteria was \"Is it user friendly.\"  I like the easy to use menu; the icons take all of the guesswork out of getting the correct setting for a picture.
