I have not been able to get a clear picture whether the clock is close or far from the receiver or on either channel.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does not do it all!", "Author": "quietus", "ReviewID": "R2KMSB8XQVURY7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Clock does work very well. Excellent picture. will allow you to monitor a different room than you are in.  WiFi is not computer compatible. It is WiFi \"like\" more like remote phones.  No sound. No recording capability would require a VCR or some other compatible form of recording. Make sure you are getting what you want here.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Limited options", "Author": "smiley2014", "ReviewID": "R1AP2D3B4WFM51", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This clock was expensive. Works well as a clock, and works well as a security camera. Biggest downfall, you can't change the angle of the camera. You have to adjust the clock to be able to see the whole area you want. Also, what is not shown in the picture, is the gigantic hole below the white dot of number 6. The hole is big enough for a pen to fit through, and is a dead give away if you even glance at the clock. Not worth your money.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Over priced not at all impressed.", "Author": "Ray Cole", "ReviewID": "RXVRU98WFNT7W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The clock keeps time, the rest of the functions...........what can I say? I do not have the VHS recorder although purchased numerous other devices to enable the device to work to no avail. Not a big fan of this product there are and I already purchased other products that are more effective and at a fraction of the cost. I should have read the reviews a little better on this item. Doesn't, hasn't and will probably ever be used for the intended use. My advise to others, don't waste your time or money on this one", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is alright", "Author": "Robert F Mcfee", "ReviewID": "R26PSN9775BMVG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Does not send the best images, but is satisfactory in keeping time.

Philbert \"usmc4mrgi\"", "ReviewID": "R2P0RNOKE7RWJY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This clock has a huge hole for the camera lens. The ONLY people who wont know it's a camera are honest people. Thieves will say, \"Nice new clock. The camera hole lets me know when it's 6 o'clock.\" But that's not the worst part of the design. The camera angle was too high and not wide angle enough to cover the area I needed. Any security camera that poses as something else MUST have a wide angle or some way to adjust the angle because there's no way to anticipate where each user might need to place it. The internal components are glued behind the face so it's ver difficult to alter the poor design without ripping the PAPER face of this clock. Sound is pure static. I'd suggest not even attaching the audio cable. Did I forget to mention the flimsy construction? Picture quality was very good with the receiver 12' feet from the clock. I guess that's something.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product... Fully recommended...", "Author": "JHorton \"In God We Trust\"", "ReviewID": "R5NU7PVYOUDHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Product... Not interference... Better than the expensive wireless cameras that I have... Just be aware due to the position of the camera of the side of the room. If the room is too small, you will need to position it in 45 Degree angle to view the action of the room, if not, you only will see the head of people; just be aware of this.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Recording Device for when Iam not Home!!!", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "R2B7JZVGEFDENE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Needs to come with a recording device!!!
