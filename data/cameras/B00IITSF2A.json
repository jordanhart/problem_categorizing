Cleveland", "ReviewID": "R40KVU69WPQ98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was surprised at all of the features this little camera has for the cost. I have two other Fujifilm cameras and find them to be very good for what I use them for. One thing is you don't go broke buying them.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I was seeking", "Author": "Jennifer Brownell", "ReviewID": "R1H06XAUUQEWOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although only a point and shoot, the camera has lots of options and the lag time is the much less than other point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Tessa Beam", "ReviewID": "R2C7ESIM2Z1IHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my mom as a present.

The T550 has good AF and bright screen, and pretty quick turn-on and shot-to-shot times  -- no complaints about the operation.  But the long telephoto was blurred (even when camera was on a base).", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sending it back", "Author": "Martha", "ReviewID": "R3CNLOM94EFGEJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Almost all my pictures come out blurry.
