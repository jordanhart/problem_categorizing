{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect, for a \"spy\" camera!", "Author": "Catherine Greninger", "ReviewID": "RXAZRTYXAHTSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's cheap! They say 5MP, but it's not really...I give it 5 star because I really do love this camera. It is very liberating because I know it's not going to take high quality, crystal clear images, it's going to take grainy pictures.This seller gives the camera with a nice tin, with instructions and wires and a cd, and more. This will be my 3rd time purchasing this product and the first seller (not this one) gave poor instruction, no tin, not presented well. With this seller it is presented well.My first camera I lost. It's so small and light weight, I forgot it was in my coat pocket and it fell out.My second camera I broke the case, and even then it still works...I dropped it a hundred times, never broke, final this last drop did it, but all the pieces stayed in tack, so I have a working camera, just no frame/case to keep it all in. I'm thinking about repurposing the parts into a fun creature or something.This does record audio, video, and takes pictures...it is said to be motion sensor, but I have yet to really figure that part out, but I believe it works)My boyfriend was able to make it a web camera (first camera, we didn't try for the second camera) and after extensive research and what not we got it to work, but I'd say dish up money for a real webcam.This is SUPER light weight! I stick it in my jeans pocket to carry around or wear it as a necklaceMore for fun. I've dropped it many times. I've put a 32GB card in it and it's worked fine.Battery DOES LAST. I've done multiple long video recordings with this with no problem, and if you are worried about battery life, you can carry a AA batttery and it's additional plug and the camera now has longer battery life.Pictures, for some reason, take 3 at a time. I use this to an advantage to make fun .gifs, but I can see it being annoying.I say \"spy\" camera, because I have used it to record conversations so I don't forget details, and you can hide this very well without notice, the audio is fairly good. Not high quality, but if sitting in a room, you can hear everyone.I would think this would be great for children, but still, it is small parts, so please be careful if you hand it to a kid. Also, you have to learn how to use it first. It has a weird system, I believe red light means audio, blue light means picture, and red and blue means video.It does time stamps as well.------Just an update - I received it VERY FAST, but damaged, I'm returning it, getting my money back and then probably re-ordering.
