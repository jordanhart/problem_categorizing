There is not a single digital anything we are still talking about let alone still buying 10 years after introduction.  I have tried many cameras over the years but still use this one everyday! Two factors make it good for me.  One is the small image size.  1.3 mp is plenty for documentation and does not take time to load or space to store.  The images are IN FOCUS!.  10 mp are great but if the image is out of focus they are worthless.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best camera ever", "Author": "Some Reveiwer Guy \"D.C.\"", "ReviewID": "R1BLRZ42XJ221G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "What can I say about this technological materpiece?  It captures a whopping 1.3 megapixals, saves directly to 3.5\" floppy disk, can take up to 100 pictures on a single charge, and comes in at a light 3 pounds (lighter than a 6 pack of beer).  I don't like this new trend of miniature electronics.  I say why not get more for your money?  This camera goes great with my Zach Morris cellular telephone.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Item doesn't work!", "Author": "David S. Fosdick", "ReviewID": "R1ZMVUEKNY7XGB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First the item comes with postage due even though I already paid the postage to the seller. Then it arrive with a dead battery, no SD slot as advertised, and the camera wouldn't even turn on. It is an archaic model that takes floppy disks for storage which are difficult to even find for purchase anymore. Very unhappy that the seller refused to take this item back after misrepresenting the product.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice old camera", "Author": "Darryl Noble", "ReviewID": "R1QJFLWB2RQRBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this camera for taking pic that I use for eBay with my external floppy drive.
