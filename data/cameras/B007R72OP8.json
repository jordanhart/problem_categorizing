But finally i got the decition and I bougth it. I'm really happy because everything arrive in perfect conditions, everything it's new. The Camera cames with the  warranty and in the original box. The plus was that it arrive before the expected time and the kit arrive complete. The bag it's perfect for the camera and all the accesories work perfect. I really recomend that kit and be relax to buy it. Even if you are out of USA like me.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "YIPPEE!", "Author": "carolBE", "ReviewID": "R317SYKK80LPBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for years to get an SLR digital camera and I couldn't be happier.  I took we a day or two to figure out how to set the f-stop and shutter speed, but all is good!  The best part...no film.  Photography, like math, you have to practice and film cost.  The sad part- I miss seeing the image appear on the paper.  It was like magic.  You have a piece of paper; you put that paper in so liquid and a picture forms.  Double edged sword.The only real negative I can think of is that it takes a lot of time to change speed/f-stop.  You hit this button, then another.  Then you have to set it. Hopefully, after I use it more this won't be an issue.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great all around", "Author": "Lori Adame", "ReviewID": "R1HZXB5FWT2GKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Filled my daughters Christmas request without crowds , parking hassles for a great price and as promised delivery.
