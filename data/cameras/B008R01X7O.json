{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera but...", "Author": "Mark D. Serbin", "ReviewID": "RA15WDG20SBZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon Rebel EOS T4i bundle was great except for one small detail and that detail kept it from getting 5 stars. The Slave Flash does not work and the seller wants nothing to do with fixing the problem. I was referred to Vivitar.The T4i takes beautiful pictures, is somewhat easy to use and does not require a course in DSLR camera use to master. Just go out, use it, play with the settings and you'll be a master of it in no time.The Canon EOS Rebel T4i is a great compact DSLR and I would make the purchase all over again.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "V Taylor", "ReviewID": "RERFQNAVSQ8WJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was worth every penny spent.

This is my frist Canon and my first digital EOS buying lenses is getting pricy, but it is what it is.If I was going to do it over I would have bought just the body and not the kit lenses and would have bought the L serieslenses instead. The kit lenses work fine, but L series are just a few steps better.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fabulous package!", "Author": "Runner Girl", "ReviewID": "R1KW8XO1NU9JI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fabulous package!  Each item comes in it's original manufacturer's packaging.  No need to run to the store to pick up UV filters, an extra battery or a telephoto lens because everything is included!  Just unpack and start taking pictures. The only item that I feel is inferior is the camera bag but everything else is great!  I highly recommend this package because you get a LOT for your money!", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice System!", "Author": "WILLIAM HOLMES JR", "ReviewID": "R3VPJ8Y93C91R9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works!Now what else need be said.
