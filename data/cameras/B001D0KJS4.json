Each day at school I bring him along and take pictures of me and my friends. As soon as I get home, i download them onto the computer. It takes about 30 seconds, literally. And I'm not that fond of instructions or being patient. It works really well. In an instant my pics are up on the computer and I can print them and put them on my wall. Now, the quality of the pictures isn't WONDERFUL like a really exspensive camera. They're just really cute. They're not bad, I like them. A child's dream, at least for me. i don't think adults would be too pleased. Also, you gotta have could lighting. If you're taking a picture with little light, the picture will be black. But, over all I am so pleased with the product.", "Date": "November 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Lots of fun for kids!!", "Author": "J.

I was surprised - they are not going to be print quality, but fun for sharing on the computer.  They had fun with the video clip feature and the web cam feature!It can slip in a pocket, purse or clip to your keychain.  We have pink and blue versions!Fun for around $15!!", "Date": "January 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "terrible camera is terrible", "Author": "abe", "ReviewID": "R3HA5GFBKJDNAL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "-terrible picture quality-pictures come out terribly blurry and dark-eats up battery life-memory depends on battery life so if it runs out on you dont expect to find the pictures there-toooooo much software instalationoverall terrible camera", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for children 5-6 yrs old.", "Author": "S.
