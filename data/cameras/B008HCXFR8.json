Ive been using a point and shoot compact camera for years.. thinking it was just as good.. but i was wrong. This camera beats the point and shoot 10 fold. at a great price, this product offers 16mp even when zoomed.. I was surprised when i took a picture fully zoomed in and actually Captured the snow flakes during a snow storm!
