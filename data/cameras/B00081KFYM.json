It would be only 1/3 the price, maybe half the price. But they spend most of the time correcting the RAW files in Aperture or Lightroom and I have always perfect pictures. No corrections, no electronic image retouche. Just great pictures!And yes, it's worth the price. You save countless hours and tons of GB harddisc space. Don't accept a second best solution. If you can afford a Nikon D2HS SLR go for it!", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Speed", "Author": "JP1984 \"Jason\"", "ReviewID": "R1EBRMWFT7O3NP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just thought I'd point out that this is a sports camera with an amazing buffer + continuous shooting mode.  Here are the specs:* Continuous High [CH] - 8 fps* Continuous Low [CL] -1 to 7 fps (programmable)* Buffer size 50 JPEG frames, 40 NEF (RAW) frames *THIS is the only reason to buy this camera over the D1X or D70.  But if you're looking for a great studio camera, the D1X won't let you down, and if you're just getting into DSLR's, the D50/ D70 are great bodies to get started on.Thanks for reading!-Jason", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera but not for 5,900", "Author": "W.

Image quality is much better than the 4.1 MP suggests. Equal to or better than D70 (better at iso 400 and above than D70), Slightly less resolution than S3 and about same noise up to 800, Fuji pulls ahead at 1600 but you have to look at a 100% crop to see it. Much less noise than D2X.Speed in continuous shooting, saving files and focus is much faster than S3 - no contest. Focus is much faster than D70.D2X advantage is solely a result of the 12MP sensor - higher resolution, however, it is visible only very slightly in 8X10 print.Battery life is stellar, like D70 and D2X - all day or two shooting.", "Date": "December 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value; Repeat Customer", "Author": "David W.

Both cameras have been in perfect condition 10/10 and have performed flawlessly.  As a result, I have been able to upgrade my equipment to professional level camera bodies at a cost of $[...] on the dollar.

Both the D3 and D3x are current production models. The D3 has 12MP and the D3x has 24.5MP. This camera has a puny 4.1MP, which is less than my new cell phone camera.

That's fine if you're submitting images to a newspaper, but if you have any chance of wanting enlargements you'll be better off with something with more resolution.Funny thing is that the Canon sports camera is roughly the same price and shoots 8.5 fps at 8.2 MP.  I'm sure Nikon could do better, but perhaps there just isn't a market for Nikon sports cameras,  I mean, look at the amount of white lenses on any mayor sporting event!", "Date": "September 28, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Includes Li-ion Battery EN-EL4, Quick Charger MH-21, Body Cap, Camera Strap AN-D2Hs, AV Cable EG-D2, USB Cable UC-E4, LCD Monitor Cover BM-3\n4.1 Effective megapixel\nTTL Viewfinder and 2.5 LCD\nUses Nikon (or 3rd party for Nikon) series interchahgeable lenses - AF Nikkor (including AF-S, DX, VR and D-/G-type)\nContinuous shooting allows 40 RAW (NEF) shots and up to 50 JPEG images for demanding action photographers", "Name": "NIKON D2HS SLR 4.1 Megapixel Digital Camera - BODY ONLY (Refurbished by Nikon U.S.A.)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41E4eiE8SoL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00081KFYM"}}
