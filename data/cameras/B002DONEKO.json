The card that comes with the tripod states:* Limited lifetime warranty!* Three-way ultra smooth photo/video panhead* Quick release plate with video indexing pin* Panhead bubble level* Geared center column with tension adjustment* Body bubble level* Oversize 0.75\" (19 mm) leg diameter* D-shape three-section legs with flip lever leg locks and heavy-duty self-leveling rubber feet* Leg braces for added stability on uneven surfaces* Extends to a full 52\" (132 cm)* Closes to only 20.5\" (52 cm)* Holds up to 3.3 lb (1.5 kg)* Weighs just 1.8 lb (0.8 kg)For my flash camcorder I found that the Sunpak 5200D tripod could be quite stable for shooting videos. (I didn't fully extend the center post, so I was using the tripod at a height of about 50\".) The quick release plate was firmly held in place. My problem with it was that it was not \"ultra smooth.\"  Whenever I wanted to pan or tilt the camera there was an initial jerk to break the friction to get the motion started. I tried spraying it with silicone spray but that didn't help much. I even tried using a screwdriver to spread the joint but that didn't help either. I would have been quite pleased with this tripod except for that problem. Maybe the one I received was just from a bad batch.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "good for the price", "Author": "T.

The tripod is indeed lightweight, weighing a nearly inconsequential 1.8 lbs. Sunpak describes this tripod as being 'designed to be a sturdy, rugged, and dependable product [that] will provide...many years of reliable service.' To back-up their assertion, Sunpak provides a one year limited warranty, which suggests repair/replacement, at the company's discretion. In addition to being equipped with the tripod itself (well packaged within plastic mind you), the package includes a simple operating instructions pamphlet, which details the tripod components and how to use those components effectively.The tripod is everything that it claims to be. Sturdy as described, this tripod put my economy-based Targus TG-42TT 42-Inch 8-Section Travel Tripod to shame. the tripod felt extremely 'grounded' given the tandem of leg brace, flip leg lock, and rubber foot. The height is a pro, extending to a maximum of 52\" and a minimum of 19\".  Having experimented with the maximum height taking a picture with a digital camera from a distance, the portrait was more than effective.Other sound features include a well designed geared center column, which adds to the stability and endurance of the device.  The Elevator crank is a coveted feature, something much more expensive tripods sport.  It is effective in extending the height beyond the constraints of the legs, epitomizing the soundness of this tripod.Overall, the Sunpak Sunpak 5200D Tripod 620-520D may have been my favorite 'Black Friday' investment.  It easily outclassed my previous tripod and saved me, am amateur photographer/videographer/enthusiast from investing more money.  A professional would probably nitpick, but assuming this would more suit an amateur, more often than not they should easily be pleased for the bucks.  4 stars.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sunpak 620-520 52\" lightweight tripod", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "R26N4LS6GU4UUE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good compact lightweight tripod for traveling.  Fit into my 22\" carry-on suitcase diagonally perfectly(not sure how it would fare in a checked bag).  A little stiff to pull out the legs to full length. Height was fine for me (I'm 5'2\"). Used with my 35mm Canon T1i while in Maui in Feb. Worked quite well on flat and non-flat surfaces providing you are holding the tripod or camera in windy conditions.  You can leave it on its own if there is no wind and it's on a flat surface.

The Sunpack fills the bill as far as being lightweight, but the head is so poorly made as to make the tripod extremely difficult to use except under the most basic of conditions.First, the pan head will not come to a full horizontal position according to the built in bubble levels. In order to level the camera with the horizon, you need to adjust the leg length on one side. Second, when tilting the camera to vertical, the head tilts far (a good 7 or 8 degrees) past the perpendicular. The way the locking mechanism works makes it very difficult to hold and lock the camera in  place to compensate for this.The head motions are too jerky to make this an effective video tripod except where a completely stationary camera is needed.

It's a nice lightweight design that fits on the camera backpack I received as well. There were a few annoyances, mostly I think because this is not meant for the SLR camera weight, the adjustable head on it wouldn't hold it's position for long before it started collapsing down. I tightened the screws as much as I could without thinking I'd strip the threads or break it, which ironically enough did cause me to break it. Because I was new to the tripod and I hadn't thought about the fact I tightened the adjustable height screw of the head, when I tried to lower it with the plastic crank attached the retaining part broke with little resistance/feedback to let me realize my mistake.

Lightweight to easily carry it around and has all the functionalities of expensive ones.Also has bubble indicator unlike another Sunpak tripod which costs a few bucks more.The first one I ordered had a problem with the bubble indicator, so I sent it back and got another one from Amazon whose bubble works fine.I have not seen how tall it can grow, but just extending the legs makes it almost 5ft. Then you can extend the neck further. Not exactly sure what the max. height is,but solves my purpose.It looks great too, with the matte black finish.The quick release pan-head is excellent.And you can move the camera in x-y-z direction. And you simply can't beat the price!The only problem is that since its a little lightweight, I am not sure of the stability. It can hold my camera(Canon SX30IS) fine.But I have not tested it in very windy weather.If you have a very heavy camera with a huge zoom lens,you might think of going for a little expensive one which have provision for hanging weights to increase stability(this one doesn't).Also,I am an amateur photographer and do not have any experience with tripods.So,a little manual which says what all the knobs are meant for might have helped.But it might just be only me.Overall,I like the product very much.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "i'm please with this item", "Author": "LinaW", "ReviewID": "R2QDUP3TAA77A9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first tripod and I choosed the unexpensive one with the good rating.

However, if you are using it for any kind of hiking/backpacking make sure you put the quick release plate in your pack! I didn't and a branch must have caught the lever releasing the plate to be lost forever (which is the only reason I gave it a 4/5). I could only find 1 site that sold a replacement plate, and they said it would take 2 months for it to arrive. On top of that they wanted to charge me the same amount of money for a whole new tripod.

This is sturdy enough for casual hikes for landscape photography, good for long exposure try outs and for usual portraiture etc.It helps one in understanding the lingo, technical aspects of choosing the right tripod and finally going to that big purchase of a amateur or professional level tripod.I would never like to venture into a photo gear shop as a newbie with no idea of what I want in my Tripod. Tripod should be an investment, an investment that is quite significant in terms of money spent, therefore I would rather invest right one time than again and again, unless of course you have all that money to spend.
