Because it doesn't have an IR illuminator, I don't have to worry about it reflecting light back to the camera at night. This is an indoor-only camera, and has no weather protection features.It works great, and is amazingly full-featured, for the price. The varifocal c-mount lens zooms to a wide 3.5mm, giving a significantly wider view than many similarly-priced cameras. And because it's a standard c-mount lens mount, you can choose from literally hundreds of specialized lenses for this camera -- a feature not usually available on such an inexpensive camera. The color and resolution is great, and the camera performs well both in daylight and at night. As a bonus, it also includes an audio microphone, although I haven't connected it for my application, so I can't comment on the audio quality.Note that this is an indoor-only camera -- if you need to mount a camera outdoors in the elements, you either need to purchase a housing, or select a different camera that has weatherproofing features designed for outdoor use.All in all, an amazingly good camera for such a low price.", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Security Cam", "Author": "Cornelius A. Harmon \"Nelius\"", "ReviewID": "R1JRROPK7B015X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the money.  I would rate it as a \"Best Buy\".  It is a truly \"Professional Quality\" camera.  It is small, light weight and has the versatility of changeable lenses.  The larger format CCD image sensor provides a very clear image particularly when zooming in for close views.  The camera has 1/4\" tapped mounting holes on both the top and bottom of the body for attachment above or below the unit.  I will be purchasing another when I expand my system.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "T. Erickson", "ReviewID": "R9BP2Y6WFZ3C9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works good. audio is good. I wouldnt say the video is great, but for a security camera its good. Not camcorder quality, but does the job. The lens isnt that great. its a little difficult to get it focused, but once you have it all set up its fine. For the price you cant beat it.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Bargain in the price range", "Author": "sactobear", "ReviewID": "RVSSJXQPFDS29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price this camera was so much better than others we tried in the same price range, it has focus control, apature control.  Comes with 50 feet of wiring and adapter for one of the connections.  We are using this in a theatre setting to show what is happening on stage to the actors in the green room, although the image is not perfectly in focus, caused by the brightness of the lights used on stage it is much better than other cameras we have tried.  It should be noted that under normal lighting conditions this is a great camera, has great color etc. The built in microphone is super sensitive, great sound pick up.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "420 TV Lines Resolution\n3.5mm-8mm Varifocal Lens\n1/3\" CCD Image Sensor\nBuilt-in Microphone for Audio\n60 ft.
