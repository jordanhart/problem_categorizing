I agree, there is a lot of peachy statements being made, but I wanted to provide the view from someone who has a home video system setup with 8 camera's, all of them outdoors, and this cam is one at the front of the house. It DOES record, no issue there, plugged it in, and when i get motion, i get recording, my system is NightOwl, and again, yes, it records video just fine. The video daytime is great, not perfect, not $1000 camera resolution, but good enough for sure. The night vision is not top notch, but not shabby either, you can certainly figure out who the individual is, as i have busted friends doing \"Boo's\" at Halloween (that was fun), and also busted a thief stealing a UPS package, police love the video. So although we may have some bright & cheery people writing reviews or we have some company reps (hey, it could happen), either way, take it from someone who is just a normal individual using the cam's at home, they work. Now, for the bad.... this cam only lasted 1 year before it stopped working, the video on that channel is now off one day on the next, for some reason the cam has issues and needs to be replaced. Is it an issue with all of them? No. But this one didnt last but 1 year, could just be that 1 isolated physical camera.  So, make your own decisions, hope this review helps.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Night vision at 50 feet.....No way", "Author": "R. L. Vance", "ReviewID": "R34UA6ZZCPTEWT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the camera up and running after a small clitch. I ordered 2  150ft cables for the camera. The cables came with BNC to RCA connectors but no Female to Female BNC connectors. I bought those at Radio Shack at an extremely high mark up ($4.00) each....Now to the camera. Good picture during day light hours but kind of a ghost shadow in partial sunlight. I'll try some adjustments(moving the camera as no adjustments on the camera itself)....As for the night vision capabilities. I think it said something about 50 to 60 feet with the infered lighting ...NO WAY, 10 to 15 feet tops. I bought this to record my mailbox becauce of vandalism. I tried it from about 50 feet and got no image of the Mailbox, then closer and still no image finally I but it about 10 feet and a good picture emerged.  One more drawback is that a car with the lights on(NIGHT VISION AGAIN)Leaves a blur as the lighted car goes by. It may sound like I am slamming this product. I am not. For the price if you wanted close to home security, good. But for detailed night vision at a 50 to 60 foot range forget about it. I also did not mention that I connected the system to my computer using  the Honestech VHS to DVD 5.0 Deluxe system I bought a few months ago on Amazon. This product does VHS tapes to DVD on your computer but also acts as a devise to hook the camera up to record on your PC. Overall review. Good cheap security, will not do 50 feet of night vision , 10 to 15 feet tops maybe 20 with a NEW MOON. Easy to get and running.... follow up to my review.I caught the guys vandalizing my mailbox.

I needed a camera that I could easily setup to overlook my front drive to give me some security while I was not home.  The camera arrived packaged securely and looked exactly as shown.  I spent a lot of time researching cameras and decided to go with this one for two reasons.  First, the previous reviews were very complimentary of the camera.  Second, the price.For my setup, I have two baluns connected to the camera.  For anyone unfamiliar with the term balun (like I was) these are signal converters that will allow you to transmit the power and video signal across a cat5E or cat6 cable.  Which is much cheaper than running power and video as two separate signals.  Plus, the baluns are relatively inexpensive.  The camera is connected to a pc through a USB video grabber and running Yawcam.  This allows me to treat my camera like an IP camera that can be viewed from anywhere with my Android phone or my wife's Iphone, which is what I really wanted.  IP cameras that do this all one were consistently reviewed as unreliable and the reliable ones were very expensive.  This was a much cheaper alternative, for my needs.The picture of the camera fits my needs.  It is clear to about 25 feet away.  From that point on, you can still easily see shapes and colors, but you would not be able to make out a license plate.  This camera does have night vision that allows you to see to about that 25 foot mark fairly easily, it will not reach past that on my tests.The camera dome does get a little warm to the touch.  I was worried at first, when I initially set it up.  However, this seems to be a characteristic of the unit.  It is still functioning fine after two weeks of continuous use.I really wanted to see how a security camera would fit into my needs before jumping all in on a more expensive unit.  Somewhere down the road I may upgrade from this one.  If something happens to it, then I am not out that much expense.  I would purchase one again in the immediate future, as long as it remains the cheapest alternative.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "ROUHPI6ARLI68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent quality.

If I turn on my flood lights, I can see as good as day. The picture is very clear. I bought this as a test. Now, I will upgrade all my cameras with these. Well worth it.

I set this up at one end of my 3 car garage and the IR LED are actually so bright that the reflection from the wall on the far side 30+ft away whites pretty much everything out. As such I had to set it up pointing at an angle to wall rather than straight on.  Next, the picture indicates the led glowing blue but in fact, they glow red in the dark and are about as bright as an alarm clock.  Next, although I am using it inside, I would question the suitability for the outdoor rating especially in snowy conditions.  On the back side of the ball that holds the camera, there are grates directly into the electronics (presumably to vent the heat) and that front edge of the camera has that gap which goes right to them.  As for the picture, I would say it is just ok.  Again at night if you are right in front of the camera, you will just be a white blob.

I will update on longevity and durability later.  Since installing a second unit as a rear view camera, I was reminded how important it is to keep the view of the light sensor (the little red item directly under the camera lens)so it has a wide open view of what you want to see.  It is also imperative to keep ANYTHING from reflecting infrared light from the LED's back into the camera.  Otherwise, in the dark, you will get a cloudy, blurred image.

To make the night vision better I constructed a paper filter with tiny holes in it to cover the circle of LEDs and thus lower their light output. Works great but I should not have had to do it!
