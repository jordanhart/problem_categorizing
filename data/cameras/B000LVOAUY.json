{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works fine for me", "Author": "King's Daughter", "ReviewID": "R34MX1CD5BH6Q6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use Duracell's Rechargeable 2650 mAh batteries with this camera and it works GREAT! It lasts about 500 pictures or so. I recommend the Powerex MH-C204W Worldwide 1-hr Conditioning Travel Charger for high mAh batteries b/c you can condition and rejuvenate the batteries after a number of charges. It also subjects aged batteries to a conditioning algorithm that first fully drains the batteries and then recharges them so that it'll perform as if new.Anyhow, this camera is wonderful: 7.2 mp is plenty enough for me - I don't take pictures worth selling so the resolution is perfect for everyday memories. I love the macro feature for close-up photos and the auto focus feature (lightly tapping the snap button once before pressing it again to take the photo) is really helpful. I also use this for my real estate listing pictures and it does very well indoors or a cloudy day. I think Samsung could do better with the video capturing however. The sound was choppy and skips if you zoom in/out while recording. But oh well, I think a camcorder should be its separate entity anyway. It's fairly light - the batteries make up most of its weight. Transfering photos onto my computer is simple, fast and easy. I have a perfect pre-cut screen protector on it so no worries there. It didn't come with a case but I got a cheap, perfect-fit Case Logic case at Target for $3.99 w/a hidden slot for extra batteries and it fits in my coat pocket.", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "MUCH better than given credit for!", "Author": "J.

White", "ReviewID": "R1R1EUQH7YES3F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a disappointment.First, I'll note that the 8 megapixel version of this camera is selling for $129 on amazon as I write this.. and I wouldn't buy that one either, though it looks like the same camera with an upgraded chip... then again, it could be worse since their Megapixel ratings are misleading at best.I felt samsung was probably a decent brand based on some of their other kinds of products, but no.  I've had a lot of experience with photography over the years, am no amateur, but was looking for a competent, inexpensive snapshot camera which used SD cards and AA batteries, and in a pinch would take video at a decent resolution.This ain't it, but I'm stuck with it.The worst thing is that even though rated at 7.2 megapixels, its images are MUCH worse than the 3.2mp olympus I had previously.  Even at the highest quality image settings you can see the grainy color pixelation artifacts even on the 2.4\" screen of the camera!The audio drops out unpredictably during the shooting of video, and the video itself is choppy, poor quality, and eats memory since it's MPEG2. Useless, and looks much worse than MPEG4 somehow.And it wouldn't format the SD card I initially bought. A call to Samsung tech support gave me the news that they only guarantee it to work AT ALL with sandisk brand memory cards, so I had to eat the price of the card I had and order an expensive sandisk card.The screen is viewable, and based on that I'd say the camera is worth about $30, but to a kid, not to anyone who wants to seriously save their pictures.This was obviously designed from the ground up as a camera meant to sell for a tiny fraction of its fictitious \"retail price\", and I assume that's the case with the 800 model too.

You must read the manual if you never used a digital camera before. Page 5 identifies the features. Set the `Mode dial' to AUTO, insert alkaline AA batteries made for digital cameras, then push the `Power button'. Page 12 explains how to set the Date/Time and Languages (any of 22 languages). You should read the pages on using the camera buttons to take still photographs. Page 13 explains the LCD monitor indicator of this camera. The `Size' and `Quality' affect the size of the photo file and the number that can fit on a given memory card. Pages 55 to 58 explain the `Setup Menu'. You should install the application software before downloading pictures to your PC. If you use rechargeable Ni-MH batteries you must use the `Setup Menu' to identify these batteries.If you choose `1600x1200' for `Size' and `Fine' for `Quality' the photo files will need about 524Kb of file space (two per megabyte). You can delete unwanted photos from memory. The SD memory card can be removed to print selected photos at some stores. If you expect to take many pictures keep extra batteries handy. Batteries that are too weak for this camera can be used for flashlights, remote control devices, etc. Always use the top-grade batteries made for digital cameras. If the batteries are weakening an indicator will show less than 3 bars. If the batteries are too weak the camera will shut down, or the screen will just go blank with the lens extended. You must put in fresh batteries to recover and turn the camera on or off. Like other delicate electronic devices, dropping it on a hard surface may cause expensive damage.The installation software requires a Pentium or AMD K6-2 with Windows 98, 98SE, Me, 2000, or XP. To install a memory card first turn off the camera and open the cover. You can use 2GB, 1Gb, 512Mb (or smaller) memory cards.  The front of the memory card faces the front of the camera, the pins on the card face the back. You must format the memory card before use. This will also delete all photos on the memory card. The manual is adequate but could use more explanations and a larger font.
