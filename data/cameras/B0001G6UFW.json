{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera with excellent quality", "Author": "Leonid Finis", "ReviewID": "R26AQ4Z08R4JFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera more than a month ago and have been surprised by versatility of the camera and quality of the images.It makes great shots in almost any lighting conditions - I tried at night, indoors, sunsets, and snow. Colors are natural.Its macro mode works great.It has A/S/M manual controls which is very useful for experienced photographers.It has exposure compensation of  +-2EV with steps of 0.5 EV and manual ISO selection.It has spot metering as well as multi-zone metering.It's not large and very easy to carry.To tell you the truth once I bought this camera I started to have doubts whether I need my Nikon N75 SLR since this small Samsung camera almost matches features and quality of a higher end SLR cameras.Minor downsides include occasional difficulty focusing in low light which can be overcome by using fixed distance settings (1M, 2M and infinity).It also lacks manual focus found in V50 model.Depth of field is very good (sometimes too good for close-up shots making it difficult to blur the background) but this is common to most of compact digital cameras.Bottom line I highly recommend this camera and think that it could suit beginners as well as more advanced photographers.", "Date": "February 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera...nothing bad to report!", "Author": "J.

The small size makes it way easier to take on trips than our SLR cameras. It's also very durable - I dropped it in the airport whole trying to take a picture and everything stayed intact!We took this camera to Cozumel with us and captured some incredible images with it. There are so many features on this camera, more than a novice photographer will ever get around to using, let alone perfecting - which is nice because it gives way more options for taking great, creative photos than other cameras! We have had this camera for coming up on a year now, and i am still learning new things about it!Bottom line, I love this camera. I am an avid photographer and my wife often has to wrestle this one away from me to get her turn behind the lens! A truly amazing camera for novice or experienced photogrpahers!", "Date": "September 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, I have ever seen among the compacter once!!", "Author": "R.

And I can clearly make out its superior features on the very first day, and sitting down typing this today itself, as I want the future customers - YOU to benefit out of my feelings on the very first day..I have been photographing since my early teens and am an avid photographer, having operated upon a range of old-model manual cameras in mid 80's, until recently when I came accross a digital camera which I bought last year. However, having felt the necessity to procure a better quality, I bought this one this year, and I am highly satisfied with its performance, given the size and price-line.I tried shooting in all sorts of conditions on my very first day with it: daylight, cloud, indoors, night-time, closepus, macro-mode..and I find the quality very superior to my earlier camera (s), of comparable specifications..Images are crisp clear; I even captured the US flag on the empire state building using the zoom feature, and the output is as lively and clear , I didnt even imagine!!The manual mode along with the auto mode gives amateur as well as experienced one's equal ease and freedom to handle and operate his one!!Though the dimensions and weight are bit more, but its worth for the quality of foto it produces..I would highly recommend you to go for this, if you are planning to shop for a mid-range camera in terms of price, and expect an outcome of a higher-end camera !!Go ahead, get it.. and enjoy photographing, falling in love with it on the very first day !!", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Find", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Art Teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R156AN8RC49MTF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Little camera....lotta fun!!!I bought this camera a few years ago and have loved it ever since. The pictures come out very clear. I choose to have mine printed at the local CVS and I edit them ahead of time. Though it takes an extra second for the zoom to frame the shot it's worth it.Having two toddler nieces I've been able to document many special moments, giggles, and smiles!!!I hope you enjoy this camera as much as I did.This is an easy to use point and shoot!!!Enjoy!!", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0001G6UFW"}}
