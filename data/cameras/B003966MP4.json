I also have ZS3, which takes great outdoor shots but poor indoor shots with flash. So I was curious how much indoor flash shot is improved with ZR3. I was happy to see that indoor portrait shots from ZR3 came out much better with more accurate skin colors and the annoying reddish cast from ZS3 seems to be gone with ZR3. Flash is a little improved. Still catching far subject indoor with zoom is challenging as the flash shoots ISO up too high and makes pictures too reddish, grainy. So, like ZS3 I had to adjust exposure settings in normal model (flash off, IS mode 2, auto ISO, min shutter speed 1/8, etc) and rely on my hand-holding skill. But considering that this is small camera, it is understandable.In outdoors, the ZR3 takes just takes beautiful crisp pictures with iAuto mode and I am very happy with the results. Overall I highly recommend this camera to people looking for simple, automatic one with high zoom, HD video.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful  high definition Video  with optical zoom in still camera", "Author": "kevin Bruce \"Kevin in Atlanta\"", "ReviewID": "R1MNOHOT8E2N78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this versatile camera for a trip to Cuba. Great stills. VIDEO is amazing, because full optical zoom can be used while shooting. Video is true high definition and  plays on HD Television and windows seven computer.  Video taken of dancers in a cabaret and of reflections on water at night were great.  The LCD is amazingly sharp. LCD is bright too.  Battery life is good. Camera is light and fits in my pocket.  Did I mention that I love the ability to optically zoom while taking great high definition video, which is still very rare?  All my older video cameras are history.  I love it. Oh, it turns on fast, and power switch is a tiny excellent toggle.  Clever power saving too.  Still photos are great, with good low light ability.

We took both still and video of my friend's BD party just after we got it (without reading the manual) and both turned out great.  The video quality is amazing.We took 2 videos, one with a relatively high end Sony Video camera (HD) and one with the Lumix (HD).  The quality of the video was the same.  The Sony had better controls on the zooming, but amazingly, the sound quality on the Lumix was better.  Of course, you can hook up an external mic with the Sony, but still....I can't say enough good things about this camera.  I was looking for something small that would fit in my purse, and this fits the bill and has tremendous quality as well.  There are some manual controls for experienced photographers, but I am a strictly point and shoot girl.  The auto focus feature determines the correct setting, and the majority of the pictures I have taken are great without fiddling with anything other than the zoom.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "PANASONIC WON ME OVER WITH THIS CAMERA!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "A.

My last camera was a Canon which also makes a great camera, but this Panasonic camera blew my Canon away. The image quality is outstanding all around, even in low light situations. I took this camera to rock concert last month and it did an amazing job even in the low light conditions of the concert arena. Also you don't have to worry if your hand shakes, because it still takes a sharp crystal clear picture. Also it is great at catching fast action moments that are sometimes hard to catch. As for the video, it is amazing, great quality and sound. Also you can zoom in and out with this camera while recording, which to me was an important option to have in a digital camera. I am very impressed and I can highly recommend this camera to anyone who is still not sure which brand to buy.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!!!

Personally I like it simple, therefore iA for me all the time. :)Oh and I even took a picture of a sunset (against the light of course) and it came out beautifully, I was really impressed.5 stars from me, there is really nothing I miss or have to criticise", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix", "Author": "Thomas Kulig", "ReviewID": "R8ZGVRHEHAN52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Lumix DMC-ZR3 is a very good camera.

I wanted a high quality, high zoom camera that would fit in my pocket. The size of the Panasonic is great- it's one of the smallest cameras with a 7x or larger zoom. I liked the Canon SX210, but with its widescreen LCD, I thought it was a little too big. 8X is at the low end of the zoom range I was looking for, but it works pretty well. With a 14MP image, I can always crop a little in software to zoom in tighter and still maintain good quality.The quality of the ZR3 is excellent. Outdoor shots in sunlight are excellent. Indoors shots are very good. Like most compact cameras, you don't have as much control as you'd like. There are about 20 scene modes, but no easy way to simply set the aperture to its widest setting to get a fast shutter speed. One feature I like is that you can put a max limit on the ISO speed so the camera won't jack it way up in its search for a fast shutter speed. That usually inserts considerable noise in the picture. I set the max ISO at 400 and noise is excellent. I haven't shot much above that, so can't comment on noisiness at higher ISOs. However, almost all compacts start to degrade above 400.Video quality is very good. You can zoom while filming, as some newer cameras can now do, which is a great feature. It has the space-saving ACVHD format, although I use the motion JPEG because it's hard to find software to edit the ACVHD.The wide zoom of 25mm comes in very handy when trying to get all of an indoor scene or a big group of people.I like this so much and the portability is so good, that I find I use this camera for most of my needs. I'll use my SLR for shooting my kids sporting events or if it's low light and I need the high ISO capability of the SLR. But it's so nice to have a high quality option that fits in my pocket. I'd highly recommend this.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, nice features and nice price", "Author": "rozman", "ReviewID": "R235JMMJFU1D8R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I previously owned an earlier generation Panasonic Lumix compact camera and was very happy with it.  I did a lot of research prior to purchasing the DMC ZR3 and have learned that over the past few years Panasonic has made quite a name for itself in the camera industry.  The primary reason for me upgrading was that newer cameras have HD recording capabilities as does the DMC ZR3 and also I was attracted to the large optical zoom capability (8X) with such a compact camera.  It is only slightly larger (hardly noticeable) than my previous Lumix, which I bought largely for its compact size.Pictures are nice quality.  Like any camera you buy -- especially compact -- pictures with a lot of natural light are going to turn out the best.  If you plan to take a lot of pictures of scenery or the outdoors during your traveling I would recommend this camera.  It takes very nice quality photos outdoors.  Indoor photos are not quite as sharp generally, but sometimes they can turn out pretty good if you are able to have a decent light source.  honestly, sometimes I force the flash off if there is enough artificial light to make due.The HD video pretty much follows suit with the still photo quality.  Best in good natural light situations, tending to be grainy in low light.  And because it is video as opposed to still frame, the granularity is more pronounced as is to be expected with probably any camera until you get into professional grade (and big bucks).  I find the ability to connect to an HD TV using a mini-HDMI cable very handy.  You should be able to find a generic mini-HDMI cable online for less than $10.  You should realize that when using the HDACV Lite mode of recording, it works nice for TV playback, but is not as PC friendly as it requires the included Panasonic software to load that format onto your PC.  You do have the option of recording in the less memory-efficient motion-JPEG format which will allow you to load directly to a PC without software, making videos more conducive for sharing.I have found the strong zoom to be good quality in terms of maintaining sharpness of the subject.  When you have the zoom at maximum or a very high level, you have to keep it very steady -- especially in lower light.  I have not yet attempted using it with a tripod, but I am confident that would produce quality results.Bottom line is that I paid less for this camera than I did my first Panasonic Lumix (which I really liked) and it has a lot of nice recent technological improvements which I find very useful.  It's well worth the money.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "T. McGrath", "ReviewID": "R2TFBE8KM0975A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product. Works well and is durable. Quality of the video is superb and software to view and edit the mts and/or mov files it produces is available online for free. Using a class 6, 32GB SD memory card and it works flawlessly. My only complaint is that in lower light settings the pictures are not as good as the video; they seem too dark. But that is when using the camera on full auto mode; I'm sure a real photo buff can alter some of the settings and make low lighting shots as good as the video. Other than that a great camera for the money that I highly recommend.

I usually research reasonably well and end up happy with my choices, but not this time. Reviews talked about lens, zoom and functionality, and while there's some truth there, the overall package makes this not worth your time.On the good side: The cameras size is decent, it's light, and the optical zoom really gets you in close to a seemingly impossible degree. I was impressed by that. The wide angle lens also works up close in a way that's better than anything I've experienced.On the bad side, sadly: The light weight felt a little flimsy, as did the battery cover door.  The lens cover was unusually thin too, and while this seemed odd, I trusted it, but I was wrong.  After a week, the lens cover is broken already.  The camera's been in nothing more stressful than my jacket pocket and briefcase pouch, so there's no reason for it to be broken, unless it was poorly designed.  On another count, photo-taking, the camera falls short too, very short, in three ways:  1) POOR IMAGE-STABILIZATION: While the zoom gets you in close, the image stabilization is lousy in zoom.  Why have a zoom capability if your image stabilization chip can't shoot a clear photo at that zoom-level?  It makes the zoom useless.  2) POOR LOW-LIGHT SHOTS: The low-light photos are fuzzy and color-deprived. When this camera says 1600 ISO, it's nothing close to what I'm used to from my previous cameras at the same ISO.  3) POOR FOCUS: The focus just isn't as sharp as I'm used to from Canon, and shots come out fuzzy even in decent light.  Really not what I'd expect from a product released by a company with Panasonic's reputation for making quality products.Panasonic has made some products I really enjoyed, especially the pre-LED TV that I had for a decade. But it's hard to imagine buying a Panasonic camera again, and I highly recommend against it.Sorry, I wanted to like this, I really did, but now I'm going through the trouble of mailing it back defective, and starting my research again.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "E. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3CS0XRXYF20CB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After many hours of online research I chose the ZR3 as my new digital camera.  I compared it to the other Panasonic cameras such as the ZS7,ZS5,ZS3,ZR1 and the FH20.  I was also considering the Canon PowerShot SX130IS.  The main reason I chose the ZR3 over the Canon was the difference in size.  I wanted something small and lightweight and the Canon did not fit that requirement.  The FH20 seems very similar to the ZR3, the only difference I seen was that it records movies in quicktime format instead of AVCHD lite and you are not able to use zoom while recording.  It does not have the intelligent zoom either.  I felt those added features on the ZR3 were worth the $40 difference.  But I didn't want to spend another $90 to upgrade to the ZS7.  I am very happy with my choice so far.  I have only had the camera 2 days so far.  It takes good pictures and video and that's what I wanted.  I was looking for a new camera with 8X zoom or more.  My old camera only had 3X zoom and that was not enough.  The pictures in low light are not excellent but they are acceptable.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Has hidden defects!

It has a high zoom and many features, and is small enough to carry in my pocket. So at first, I was very happy with this camera. But after about 10 months of use, I started seeing black spots in my photos. At first, I thought that this would go away if I cleaned the lens. However, after doing some research, I realized that dust has gotten into the lens and onto the sensor. This dust appears as black spots on all photos, and can't be easily removed. I used the camera for only a year, and I took good care of it. I have never seen this happen before, and it is a serious defect in the Dmc-zr3. However, Panasonic refuses to admit that they are at fault. My warranty has now expired, and Panasonic told me that the repair has to be done at my cost. To remove the dust, the camera has to be taken apart, and this can cost $150! Furthermore, it seems that Panasonic is aware that their camera has this defect, because it appears that they have quietly discontinued the zr3.

I used to have a Sony Cybershot for many years, and I wanted to make a change. It was not as good as the Sony but the pictures were very good. Suddenly, two spots appeared on the camera, and they never went away. I did some research and I found out that is a problem with the CDC or Image Sensor.I called Panasonic Support but they said that they won't repair it. They will exchange the camera for a refurbished one, and of course, I will have to pay for the exchange.Very disappointed! I was punished by Sony.UPDATE 06/21/2011: Panasonic Support referred me to a different unit of their company: The Panasonic Exchange Center. The name says it all: They will NOT repair the camera: They offered me an exchange for a refurbished one for $ 128.35 plus the cost of shipping my camera to them to McAllen, Texas. I am appalled to say the least. The person on the phone was very nice, and she told me that lots and lots of people call every day, and get extremely upset when they found out Panasonic's pseudo-repair policies. She said that Panasonic reads the Amazon reviews, and that if people start being more open and proactive about their experience with them; they might consider change their policies.Doing research online, it seems that the Lumix series has a \"common\" problem with the CDC or Image Sensor, which is the reason why the WARRANTY only covers the CDC for 6 months (parts) and ONLY 90 days (labor).

I think my 10 years old 5MP Olympus C50 took better pictures than this one. But this is a good replacement to my camcorder, because it is very small, wide angle zoom lens, HD(720p).  I am quite happy with it. I use it for family video and use a DSLR for photo. If this camera still works, I will give it 3 stars for photo and 4.5 stars for video (considering the price and size). I give it 1 star because this type of camera should not have dust problem.There is no point to spend money to repair a $200 camera. I just upgraded my Nikon D40x to D5100 to add the video function.Update (5/2013):There several videos in youtube showing how to clean the optical sensor for the similar camera. Thanks for the people who put the video there. I tried few days ago. It was quite easy and took me about 15 minutes. The dust was fairly large (kind of fiber material)in my case.

I tested earlier a Canon SD-1400 and the Panasonic was a good improvement. Pictures will come in focus almost always in contrary to the Canon that has huge problems with the auto focus specially indoors. The camera size and ergonomics are just good. The camera is compact but not ultra-compact. It will still fit in a jeans pocket, but a little bit tighter. The Canon sd-1400 felt much smaller and no doubt has a much sexier design.The zoom and the HD video are very strong points for this camera. The HD video was very good and you can use the 8X zoom while shooting with no noticeable motor noise.My main problem with this camera was the indoor picture quality, specially in low light conditions. We wanted a simple point and shot and neither myself nor wife like to get to play too much with settings. Most of my tests were using the Intelligent auto mode. Unfortunately a lot of the pictures indoors at night will come with a yellowish color. The flash seems not to be powerful enough for the job. I know that it is a problem of many compact cameras but the picture quality was just unacceptable.After some more research I finally bought the Sony Cybershot DSC-WX5. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VCEDR0/ref=oss_productJust to be clear, although I got the Sony on sale, the price price point is a little bit more expensive than the Canon and Panasonic cameras that I tested. My rational was that I want to keep the camera for some years, so the extra $80 will not be a huge deal taking in account that I'm getting a superior product.The Sony really delivered so far the promises.

But film just doesn't make sense or meet our immediate need for gratification in today's digital world. So when that era faded, I stuck with Canon and after much evaluation, bought a Canon Powershot Elph SD450 (5mp) which has been my main camera for several years now. In the two years that followed, I bought two of my grown kids the Canon Elph SD500 and Canon Elph SD750. All basically the same camera with a few more features and more megapixels. We are all more than pleased with the very small size, durable metal construction, excellent photo results including videos, and ease of transferring to our PC's. So when I got the Panasonic ZR3, I compared it in a shot-by-shot contest against my older Canon SD450 and the new, highly advertisied Nikon S8100. Needless to say, I used many difficult shooting situations, including low light and macro situations. How did they compare?  I'll cut to the chase and give you my bottom line results and opinion: the Panasonic ZR3 was my favorite amongst the three, as I felt it did the best job OVERALL with both snapshots and video, plus it had that sturdy all-metal feel in a very compact body, very similar to my Canon SD450. And there lies the rub: the results were so close to my Canon SD450, I could not justify spending another $180 without getting SIGNIFICANTLY better results in a different camera. The other factor that turned me off on the Panasonic was this: it was much more difficult learning to dump the pics to the PC with the included software than with the Canon using the USB cord method, but that can be mastered with practice or maybe even eliminated with a SD card reader (I just ordered one). And if you have an older PC like I do, you'll probably need to download one of the free high definition players off CNET like KM Player to view the HD movies. But that is true, no matter which HD movie mode camera you purchase if you have an older computer to work with. By the way, for those considering the Nikon S8100 which can cost about $80 more than the Panasonic ZR3, it definitely has many more bells and whistles, but if you're shooting on automatic most of the time, here's some of why I passed on it: It's not as compact as the Panasonic ZR3 and it has a plastic feel to it. I could not get use to the auto pop-up flash that kept popping up in the exact spot where my finger was, delaying many shots. It did do a fabulous job taking fast snapshots in low light with that CMOS sensor over the CCD sensor, however, the deciding factor had to do with it's videos. The Nikon's videos in low light were bright but it did not want to focus when I was zooming in, which resulted in much unacceptable out of focus footage, whereas both the Canon SD450 and Panasonic ZR3 snapped into focus.  By the way, I feel I should mention that the ZR3 is a great value and the forgotten step-child in the Panasonic Z line as you don't find many reveiws on it; most go right for the next step up, the Panasonic ZS5 because it has more features. But if you're going to shoot mostly in automatic modes, you don't need those and can save about $50 in sticking with the ZR3.So did I ever find a new camera worth buying with my limited budget? Yes, I did! As a retired person, I really didn't have the budget to buy the digital version of my faithful old Canon Rebel SLR which was about $500, so I settled on the next best thing within my budget: a high-end point and shoot compact zoom that looks and feels like a DSLR without the cost or weight and has a great 18X optical zoom, as well as all the automatic point and shoot modes any new grandpa could want! I purchased the highly rated Panasonic Lumix FZ35 from Amazon and alhough I've had it less than a week, I already love it and it's a great value at about $250. It has techinically been replaced by the FZ40, but many reviewers like the older FZ35 model better and you will save another 40 bucks.

The specs sound great on it and I liked the video recording features it had as well as the long zoom. Unfortunately the picture quality was terrible when used for anything other than bright sunlight. At ISO 400 there is already very noticeable noise and it just gets much worse from there. I gave two stars because the video quality still manages to be pretty nice. Still, this is a camera first and due to the noise it was just not good enough and I returned it. Also, FYI non-Intel macs will not be able to play the video format for this camera and the camera software is PC only.I ended up settling on the Canon Powershot 210SX IS.

I may have gotten a bad example and probably should have returned it, but I didn't.  So here's what I have found in about 9 months of use.One of the factors in purchasing this camera is the 8x optical zoom in a very compact size.  This camera easily fits in a shirt pocket or pants pocket.  The small size does not compensate for poor performance.The 10x intelligent auto zoom is unusable.  The idea is that this is supposed to be a really good digital zoom that gives near optical zoom quality and a bit more magnification.  Instead, it makes soft, poorly-focused images even in bright sunlight.  I generally don't use this setting for fear that I will zoom past 8x and ruin the photo.Which brings us to performance in moderate to low light conditions.  One word: terrible.  If you need the flash and get more that a few feet from the subject, noise (random-colored pixels generated by the sensor, not your subject, that make the picture look grainy) dominates the images.  No exaggeration here, I think maybe 25% or more of the pixels are in error in typical room light.In regular auto mode, images are ok in daylight, but never really sharp.  My son has a five year old, 8MP Canon A590 and the images from that camera are far superior--sharper, better contrast and color, much less noisy.This camera's one positive performance is video.  It uses AVCHD (also known as MPEG-4) to store HD video and consume much less memory or hard drive space versus MPEG-2 or motion JPEG.  Interestingly enough, the video images generally look better than than the stills.  This is the only reason I kept the camera - good HD video in a small package.  The video got this camera an extra star, otherwise, it is a one star product.I wish the camera manufacturers would stop bowing to marketing pressure and stick with the high quality 10-12MP sensors.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great all around camera", "Author": "Blue82", "ReviewID": "R1KY6APQDPASXT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great all around camera.  My old Canon Powershot was getting a little slow to respond and had no video capability.  The low light results were poor at best, but I understand the limitations of the sensors on the smaller cameras.  I bought a Nikon P100 last fall.  It takes great low light shots and gives me a lot of flexibility to play with shutter speeds and aperature settings.  Those things come with the price of a much larger camera body.After reading a lot of reviews on Amazon I settled on the Panasonic.  It takes great quick shots in all kinds of situations and does a pretty decent job in low light.  I like the intelligent auto setting.  I usually get the shot without a problem.  The added feature of video made it perfect for me.  I work with international exchange students through my Rotary district.  This camera is great for getting action shots on trips and at conferences.  Due to its small size and weight I can have it with me all the time.Make sure to use a good quality SD card.  Don't skimp and try and save money in this area.  It will have a detrimental effect on the camera's performance.  Spend the extra money and get the class 10 card in at least 8 gig.

My pictures of the Tower of London and the Eiffel Tower are crisp and beautiful and the zoom is incredible.  I got architectural details of Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower that are great, and a clear zoom-in on the Arc de Triomphe from the top of the Eiffel Tower at night was astounding.A big reason I chose this camera is that my old one was so difficult to change settings on, I had to go into a menu to go through other menus to get the appropriate setting to try to get the shot.  By then, I had always missed it.  This camera was a great pick for getting into menus.  The dial on the top of the camera is super easy to get to and it only takes a little practice to get to know the many settings available.  I found the night settings and a few others the ones I used the most so locating them was very quick.Also, turning the flash off was very quick so if I took a photo in ambient light that wouldn't work with the flash, I could make a quick change and turn off the flash and get a great picture.  And when the flash was off I still (usually) got a nice, still photo (the long-distance Arc de Triomphe at night on zoom took three shots to get it perfect but it worked.)Speaking of zoom, it is SO easy to get to the zoom and it was super-fast responsive and focused so quickly, I could zoom in and get the shot, even if it was something or someone moving, very quickly and easily.I tried the video a couple of times to capture street performers and they were nice and crisp, the sound was good but obviously not great as the mic is built-in and some of the performances were at a bit of a distance.The battery is generally good.  I got almost two days of near constant use out of it but didn't keep an eye on the battery level so I ran out toward the end of day two, grateful that I had gotten most everything I wanted to.  It also charges fairly quickly, less than two hours, I'd say.All in all, I'm completely thrilled with this camera.

With the flash, however, you can literally move the camera across the room while taking a photo and it will still focus on one thing and take a great photo of that.The video quality is awesome! Also great that it has a zoom. Even in low lighting it takes a perfect video and actually seems to make the room appear lighter than it really is. My camcorder didn't even take as good of video's in evening house lighting. The sound is nice also. I also love that with a push of a button you are recording video. No fumbling through any menu's, or changing a dial. Just the push of the button and you're recording!There are a ton of special settings on this camera to choose from. I also liked that you can have it set up in a few different modes so that you can just switch the top dial to change to a commonly used setting so you don't have to fumble through the menu each time you want to use that. You can just turn the dial and you have it ready to go. It's also nice for the more experienced user because you can manually adjust the settings (shutter speed, etc.).

The price was fair for what I would have paid for it.This camera is an update of our previous camera. Which we love. That camera is an 8mp camera, but the little door that keeps the batteries in place broke on the end. The camera still works, but I really don;t want to have to put a piece of tape on it to keep the little door shut (it still works, but the door is slightly open - which bugs me)On this camera, the battery locks into place - I LOVE THAT!, if the door breaks, it won't matter, because the battery and the memory card each lock into position without the need for the door to even be there at all. That one feature is worth the camera.It comes with a battery charger and it appears (so far) that the battery it comes with lasts a very long time. If I was to use it on vacation, I'd think that I could take pictures all day long and recharge the camera at night, so you probably do not need an extra battery. If you foresee taking a LOT of pictures, often, and not being around power to recharge the battery, you might want a spare battery.The pictures and ease of use are amazing.I am a full time professional videographer. Often, stories can be told very well, artistically with still images for the video.

You know you're always looking for a little camera to carry around when you don't feel like dragging out the DSLR?  This might be it!I bought this through the amazon outlet, where I've never been disappointed.  It was \"Used-very good\" If you haven't used the outlet, don't be afraid.  Well, don't pay 95% of new price either, but when it's 20%+ off, what you'll get is as nearly new as you can get.  My guess is, shown by camera reviews here, is that there are a lot of finicky people who return cameras after using or not using them for a couple of days. So there's that, plus I wanted to try something like this on the cheap.Well, it works. Buying at agreat price and the results being so good make me very happy.I'm comparing this against:Sony W370Nikon S80Lumix FP8All are similar size, zoom, megapixels, price etc.The Sony has an expanding lens, the other two are internal optical zoom. Of these, the Nikon is probably the best, and it does very good video.So the ZR3 is better than these three and will be my pocket camera.  The pictures are as good as the much bigger Nikon Coolpix P series, which are much bigger cameras with much higher zoom.  It's just about as good, maybe the same, as my three year old P80, but of course not as good as a new P500. But I wouldn't pay $400 for a ZS7 (that's the current amazon price, it's usually less expensive) just to have things like GPS and otherwise wouldn't do much more. Put another way, if you want to spend the $400, buy the new Nikon P500.Keeping on topic, Lumix are great cameras all around, vibrant colors, excellent contrast, many user options.This is a fine companion camera, it is small enough to fit in you pocket easily even in the smallest case and will yield impressive shots because you'll be able to have it on hand when an occasion happens when you otherwise wouldn't be lugging around your bigger stuff.And if this is the only camera you'll have, that's cool too.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "A camera worth buying", "Author": "Taonian Chen", "ReviewID": "R1QX7IMLRRQTX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on the following reasons:1.

When I got the camera I put it together, and snapped a few pictures to make sure it worked alright then put it away until our trip.  It worked fine the first day.  On the second day a black spot appeared in the upper center of my LCD screen.  I tried to clean the lens with lens cleaner, but the spot remained.  Since I had no other camera to use I took my vacation pictures hoping it was the LCD screen and not the lens.  When I got home I downloaded pictures to my computer, and to my dismay spot was on most of my vacation pictures.  I called Panasonic and got nowhere.  They wanted me to send camera to McAllen, Texas for someone to look at it to determine if it was a defect.  If it was, which it obviously was to any idiot, they would send me a refurbished camera.  This did not sit well with me as the camera was brand new, and they wanted to replace it with what would be basically a used camera.  I then called Amazon, and told the man my story.  He said since I could not get satisfaction with Panasonic and I had a case number with Panasonic they would issue me a full refund for price of camera but it would have to go through their Large item department.  He told me he would personally handle it to make sure I got that refund.  Panasonic would not give me the option of taking my camera to a local repair shop and have them pay for it or reimburse me.  Also, Amazon considers cameras hazardous materials and would not accept it as a return for an exchange.  I got an e-mail next day saying that they cannot take it as a return and to call them to determine how best to proceed.  Got e-mail after department closed so I did not know if I would get that refund.  My husband called next day, and they said they would issue full refund and apologized for the camera ruining our vacation pictures.

After months of research, I landed on this model because of the Leica optics and the effusive reviews of the Panasonic line.  It was, to say the least, a disaster and though I don't usually do such things, I returned it and am still using my 3 year old Casio EXS600 which despite a relatively low megapixel rating, blows this camera out of the water in terms of sharpness, clarity and color balance.  I'm a former pro photographer who has owned a lot of equipment over the years and I cannot believe how bad this camera performed.I tested it outdoors on a sunny day and on both ends of the lens - wide angle and max zoom (with the digital zoom disabled because), the noise was hideous - as it was for all focal lengths in between.  The term sharp seems foreign to this camera.  Auto-focus is nothing more than murky concept to this unit.  I tested it on various shooting modes for close ups and other scene modes and maybe 1 out of 15 turned out sharp and clear. But that's not the worst of it.The flash, was particularly weak as well but even that isn't the worst part.  The color in shots indoors were horrendous.  No matter what I did to adjust any of the settings, shooting under indoor lights using a flash turned out hideously mis-colored shots that would require copious amounts of Photoshop to fix.  I shot pictures side by side with my trusty old Casio and was horrified to see the yellow, and green hues (from tungsten and fluorescent lights) coloring the parts of the photo that the flash was too weak to illuminate.  Several co-workers took one look at the photos and said - \"take it (the Panasonic) back - it's a joke.\"  I honestly wanted it to work, read the manual from cover to cover and tried to excuse it and figure out if the settings were somehow at fault.  But my trusty old Casio and everyone else's cameras (I work in Marketing and graphics are a part of what we all do), some newer, some older,  compensated just fine for the indoor shots, while this one failed miserably.  I called Panasonic, and asked what I might be doing wrong and their only answer, from a person who clearly knew nothing about photography and was obviously reading from some online user's guide said to \"reset\" the camera.  I'd already tried that - so I was done.  Vanns to their credit, shipped quickly, and did a quick and efficient return and refund for the camera.

Indoor shots with ample light always required the flash, and came out horrifically orange to the point that the picture was worthless. I worked with customer service with Panasonic to no avail, so this is being returned and exchanged for the high-end Lumix that I borrowed from a friend.

The Eastman Kodak \"Brownie\" was introduced back in 1900, with millions of Brownie 127 cameras sold between 1952 and 1967. The Brownie slogan was, \"You push the button, we do the rest.\" It was in 1948 when Edwin Land introduced the Land camera which became the Polaroid Land Camera. It was in response to daughter Jennifer's question, \"Why can't I see them now?\"At one time, it was all the rage, as when I was a kid film often had to mailed away for processing. Three or five weeks later, you finally knew who had their eyes closed or their tongues sticking out. My Dad still has his Polaroid Land Camera. Later, it became a niche market used by realtors and by my mentor, Ed Marlo, as you could approximate half-tones for publishing with a screened adapter.\"Point and Shoot\" cameras have always had great appeal. The Kodak Instamatic sold some 50 million between 1963 - 1970. In 1970, the battery-powered flash bulb gave way to the self-contained pyrotechnic wonder, the \"Magicube.\" The Kodak 110 format Pocket Instamatic came about in 1972, selling 25 million in less than three years. Times have changed, the last film camera I purchased was an Olympus 35mm Quickshooter Zoom, 35-70mm. By today's standards, it is monstrously large and heavy point and shoot, but back then it was living pretty large. We went through grocery bags of film shooting pre-illustrative photographs for several of my earlier books.Several AA-powered Canon PowerShots are still in the \"collection,\" with the PowerShot A610 featuring a humble 4x optical zoom and 20 scene modes to go with its 5.0 megapixels. As it turns out, \"megapixels\" are currently the pet rock of the digital camera world. We like more \"mega\" everything, but image quality come from lens quality and sensor size, not just cramming more un-needed pixels onto a tiny sensor. The Mega-Pixel Myth still rages rampant, even though 5 megapixels is more than most consumers could ever want or use, even going up to 16 x 24 posters as David Pogue was able to show in the New York Times in February, 2007.Every couple of years, digital cameras get slimmer, lighter, and more feature-laden. The bulbous old Canon PowerShot A610, long ago retired from the field, looks like odd plastic rock compared to the latest digital pocket cameras, that now actually fit in pockets.The travel zoom category was more or less pioneered by Panasonic, with the 2006 model Lumix DMC-TZ1. It was the first consumer compact to offer a 10x optical zoom. For the hunter, hiker, outdoors person, it is attractive to have a unit that is handy and pocketable, yet capable of grabbing both a dazzling sunset and having enough magnification to get to whatever wildlife is encountered. In preparation for this little article from an enthusiast's point of view, I spend some quality time with a Panasonic 8x (10x intelligent) zoom DMC-ZR3 made in Japan, a Sony 10x Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V made in China, a Nikon 18x Coolpix S9100 made in Indonesia, and a Canon 14x PowerShot SX230 HS made in Japan.One \"feature,\" worthless as far as I'm concerned, is a GPS included with your camera so you can bore people with clumsy maps telling them the coordinates you've been to, or just leave it on and wait for your camera battery to discharge prematurely. It is hard to find products without GPS's, meaning cell phones, binoculars, and even your GPS includes a GPS. It's really dumb, but it is called \"geotagging\" and it is nevertheless a feature. Of the cameras mentioned, the Sony and the Canon both have it. Sony takes the trouble to tell you what direction your camera was pointed in when you took the picture, not exactly wake the President material.The consumer based digital camera, as well as higher end cell-phones, have extremely small sensors. A 1/2.5 in. sensor is actually 5.3 x 4.0mm. Most of the latest cameras (including the Nikon and Canon) have a 1/2.3 in. sensor, or 6.1 x 4.6mm. None of these camera capture in RAW, minimally processed format that more interested photo-shoppers might prefer, saving the files in JPEG compressed format. All of these cameras capture 720 HD video as well, or better. The importance of that is up to the individual.Going down the line, it is easy to eliminate cameras in my terms, although obviously different folks (including the many fine dedicated photophile sites) don't always agree. The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V is close to a disaster, as it is turtle slow. I was able to get reasonably good output, but the camera is like a slow laptop with a lens, insisting on processing and saving at an irritatingly slow pace. It is even worse when attempting video, as it takes as much as 6 seconds before it so much as starts recording. Despite other gimmicks, like 3D shooting and a very good LCD display, this camera is just too slow to be a worthy hunting or outdoor companion.I purchased the \"Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD\" in June of 2011 for about $167. Since then, prices have crept to about $200, although there are newer models (Panasonic DMC-FH25K 16.1MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD) that can be had for $130 or so as of this writing. Slightly smaller and lighter than the rest, it is fast and takes excellent pictures in the \"dummy mode,\" my favorite mode. Though lacking the zoom range of the Canon and the Nikon, not having as large or as crisp of a screen, its long battery life (330 shots) and virtually fool-proof operation make it an excellent, reliable choice for the money.That leaves the two most feature-laden finalists, the Canon PowerShot SX230 HS and the Nikon Coolpix S9100. Both have upgraded, larger and crisper LCD screens. Technically, this is how they stack up, using essentially the same sensors.CANON SX230 HS 12.1 effective Megapixels (BSI-CMOS sensor)28-392mm equiv lens with optical stabilization1080p HD video and HDMI connection3.0 inch LCD with 461,000 dot resolutionISO sensitivity up to 320013 shooting modes, 11 Scene Modes, 11 Color ModesNIKON S9100 12.1 effective Megapixels (BSI-CMOS sensor)25-450mm equiv lens1080p HD video3.0 inch LCD with 921,000 dot resolution'Hybrid' VR image stabilization incorporating sensor shift and electronic stabilization (in video mode, sensor shift VR is disabled)ISO sensitivity up to 32005 shooting modes, 15 Scene Modes and 6 Effects modeThe great appeal of the Nikon is its 18x zoom compared to the 14x of the Canon. The Canon has a GPS, although a poor rendition of it. The Nikon is a bit faster, while the Canon does slightly better in high-ISO, low light applications. The Nikon shoots continuous drive at 9.5 fps compared to 3.2 fps for the Canon.Both have sharp LCD screens, the Canon a bit unusual in that it is a 16:9 aspect screen, more helpful for video than stills. Battery life is rated at 270 pictures for the Nikon vs. 210 for the Canon with the Canon's GPS turned off. Canon supplies you with a handy external charger, where the Nikon as supplied charges the battery in the camera (as did the sea-slug Sony). Extra batteries are invariably a good idea, but you'll need to buy a charger as well for the Nikon (and the Sony) if you want to continue to use your camera.For video, the Nikon shoots full-blown 1080p HD @ 30 fps, while the Canon stops at the inexplicable film frame rate of 24 fps. Both have fun and very usable slow-motion (240 fps) video modes as well, with the Canon's modes a bit easier to navigate to. Although the Nikon is better-handling in my view, it has build-quality issues. There is significant roughness, vibration, and noise when zooming, compared both to the smooth and silent Canon SX230 and the simpler Panasonic DMC-ZR3.If you are on a budget and like the idea of long battery life, the Panasonic DMC-ZR3 (or similar Lumix models) fits the bill with an easy and effective intelligent auto mode. For a true 14x optical zoom range, more manual controls, the best low-light images of the group, along with a GPS of dubious value, the Canon SX230 HS wins this match-up on the basis of both features, performance, and build quality. Its battery life is a concern, particularly when shooting video or with the GPS engaged, so for most folks a second fully-charged battery at the ready will be mandatory. The SX230 is a thoroughly satisfying hunting and outdoors companion with little question.Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman.

Overall we were very pleased with it.  Until we dropped it, in it's case, a few days ago.  We brought it to a local camera repair shop who said there was damage that could not be repaired.  The camera is just over 6 months old and we contacted Panasonic to see what our options are.  Basically, they told us to send it in and they would send us back a refurbished similar model for @ $140.00 (we paid $179.99 for it brand new!)  We were honest with the customer service rep and told her we did drop it, so I guess that goes to show you what you get for being honest!  We have friends and family who have dropped their digital cameras and they still work just fine, and others have dropped them, sent them in for repair and didn't pay a dime because they were still under Warranty.We will not purchase a Panasonic again as we feel their Warranty Policy is unfair and unethical.  We also feel that although this camera worked well, it is far too fragile and the durability is terrible.  If you have children, tend to drop things, or want to use this camera in \"Real Life\" and not be afraid of setting it down wrong, then this Panasonic camera is NOT for you.

I finally settled on the Panasonic Lumix ZR3.  In comparison to my outdated Exilim, the ZR3 was amazing.  My only complaints are that the battery life is not as good, despite having a sleep mode.  Also, the modes toggle out of position easily.And then.  It broke.  I bought a case for it right after I got it and took good care of it.But the shutter won't open all the way (so the bottom left of pictures and videos is black), and the zoom gets stuck sometimes.  I don't know much (i.e. anything) about cameras, but I gather that something is wrong with the lens.Unfortunately, a local camera store said it will cost me pretty much a new camera (200 plus 25 shipping) to send it out to get fixed.I'm sad.  Not to mention that this is EXACTLY what happened to my old Exilim... But it took my Exilim five years and seven months to malfunction in this way, and the ZR3 took seven months (isn't it just precious that they broke EXACTLY one year apart?).  With my track record, it seems that if I can keep a camera for five years (and have it last through three years of college), I probably should have been able to keep the ZR3 for a few years, too.

And, so far I am not sorry I bought it.  I have one major frustration however.  The instruction book is on an enclosed CD and, if you want to have the instructions handy in the field where most pictures are taken, then you or someone you pay (like I did) must print it.  I paid a copy shop $14.00 to print and bind the 187 page booklet.  They did an amazing job.  Spiral bound, clear plastic front cover and a convenient 1/2 size (down from 81/2 X 11).  It looks and and serves its purpose just great - and, it should have been furnished by Panasonic!  I actually waited a few weeks before I used the camera so I could comply with the first line of the instructions which say \"Read the instructions before using the camera\".  It unfortunately took me some time to get it to the copy shop.  This comment isn't in any way intended to detract from what will probably be an excellent rating for the camera once I learn and utilize all of the functions.

When taking pictures of children - or like taking pictures in a restaurant's kitchen like I did today - the mili-second is of importance. This camera isn't smart enough to adjust to different lighting conditions.

There are always costumes that have to be seen to be believed. I did some research of product reviews on Amazon and CNet, and the ZR3 souned like it hit the sweet spot, especially since it allowed zooming during HD video recording. And the HD recording is indeed pretty good.The problem is, the picture quality is awful. Shots taken of the parade outside are full of glare off of buildings. I could see glass buildings doing this, but not brown marble. When I brought it inside to capture the folks posing for photo ops in their costumes, the results were pure rubbish. Grainyness is ever-present, making at least half of the pictures unpresentable. The lobby was pretty well lit, but most picture have an ugly bronzing. And if there's any source of artificial light directly in the shot, it comes out in the photo like a supernova, blotting out the object of focus. I took a picture of a Darth Maul, and what in reality was a cheap battery-lit lightsaber toy comes out in the photo glowing as brightly as in the films.I now have to spend hours cleaning these up in a photo editing program in order to achieve anything usable.

The images she creates will help her frame her characters and their environments, even though today's scenes are so different from the places she writes about.
