Before I purchased this DSLR, I've been using the D90 my friends owned.  I totally love it so I decided to buy one for myself.  The camera itself is great.  No comments about that.  Still have to figure out everything about it.  The 18-55mm and 70-300mm is great for beginners.  The only thing that bothered me is that the Seller sent the 18-55mm lens not in it's original box and the lens cap for both sides are not original nikon.  The lens cap is loose and keeps on falling off so the local camera store here suggested to put the filter on all the time to prevent the lens from getting damaged while I wait for the 52mm cover to arrive.  The rest of the lenses that came with this package is a Bower 500mm +2x converter not a rokinon as advertised, I realized it was difficult to use the 500mm without a tripod and the lens itself needs a lot of work.  Used it to get a photo of the recent supermoon with a lot of ISO adjustments.  You need to use the T-mount to be able to attach the lens.  The macro-wide angle lens is also by bower.  But one thing I have not figured out is how to attach this wide angle lens even with all the adapter ring they've provided.  It seemed that non of the rings fit either with the t-mount to be able to attach it to the camera.  6 piece accessory kit is not that important (comes with a mini tripod which can't really hold up a dslr, rather good for a small point and shoot camera).  The filters are so far.  The flash seems flimsy so I haven't used it yet.Over-all:Pros:Nikon d90 is great only because it is nikon d90.Cons:The whole package (excluding the two nikon lenses):  Make sure you get what the seller is advertising.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Camera Kit includes all BRAND NEW merchandise with manufacturer supplied accessories plus FULL USA warranties\nNikon D90 12.3 MP Digital SLR Camera + Rokinon 500mm F/8 Lens with 2x Converter (=1000mm)\n18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens + Nikon 70-300mm F/4-5.6 Telephoto Zoom Lens\n.42x Wide Angle Lens + 4 Piece Macro Close Up Kit + 16 GB Memory Card + UV Filter (2) + PL Filter\nDeluxe Camera Bag + 50\" Tripod + 3 Year CELLTIME Warranty Repair Contract", "Name": "Nikon D90 12.3 MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens + Nikon 70-300mm F/4-5.6 Telephoto Zoom Lens + Rokinon 500mm F/8 Lens with 2x Converter (=1000mm) + .42x Wide Angle Lens with Macro + +1, +2, +4, +10 4 Piece Macro Close Up Kit + 16 GB Memory Card + Multi-Coated UV Filter (2) + Multi-Coated Polarizer Filter + Digital Slave Flash + 50\" Titanium Anodized Tripod + Deluxe Camera Bag + 6 Piece Accessory Kit + 3 Year CELLTIME Warranty Repair Contract", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fWJEPnh%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003HE2O46"}}
