My 17 year old also has the same camera in a different color. This is remarkably easy to use, has a plethora of features that enable them to take profoundly clear and fun pictures. My budding photographers use this camera to chronicle their everyday lives as well as find the beauty in the world around them. Good choice, pleased with the product as a whole. Only regret is there is no second set of batteries, secondary power source, etc. they use up the charge on this one routinely.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Compact, Full featured, Versatile", "Author": "W.

I have had the power supply go out three times, once under warranty and the second time I had to pay.  After the second repair it would not longer communicate with the camera/pc cable.  Kodak blamed it ont he cable put replacing that didn't resolve the problem.  Kodak took an \"oh, well\" attitude and has lost me as a future customer.  I won't bother to try and get it fixed again.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Broken on Arrival", "Author": "Meghan Overby \"Mego\"", "ReviewID": "R3E5BPDXJ1X5W5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a similar Kodak EasyShare that i loved! It got lost recently so i decided to purchase a new one. Beach Camera got wonderful reviews. HOWEVER. I paid for overnight shipping and got it two days later and when I finally got the camera the box looked like it had been kicked around and was covered in dust and the camera inside will not charge or turn on. WHAT A WASTE! Beach Camera is not open on Fridays and their hours are short and are unhelpful. what a horrible company to order from! 100% displeased with my purchase and service!", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8.1-megapixel resolutiono for stunning prints up to 30 x 40 inches\n3x optical zoom lens with optical image stabilization, 5x digital zoom; HD still capture and VGA video\n2.7-inch indoor/outdoor color LCD; in-camera charging using the included Li-Ion rechargeable battery\nOptical image stabilization, blur reduction technology; High ISO (up to 1600) captures the details in low-light conditions and fast-action situations\nCompatible with SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare M893IS 8.1 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BMZR9PyEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0013FWOJG"}}
