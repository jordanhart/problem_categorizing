In this sense it is a tiny digital cousin of the Lomo film cameras.Pictures tend to be over saturated or bleached out. But that is part of its charm: you never quite know what you get until you enlarge it in your digital processor.I travel with 2 cameras, my Canon S100 and this little Chinon -- and when I'm really traveling light, I usually limit myself to the Chinon\u2026.
