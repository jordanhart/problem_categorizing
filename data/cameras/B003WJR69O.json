{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice upgrade from the LX3", "Author": "Mic Masterson \"Mic\"", "ReviewID": "R1V5G2WWETOEOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really fantastic and a nice upgrade from the LX3. That's not to say that everyone should upgrade, but I think there are some significant advantages.For me, I really needed the additional zoom and was very excited to hear that this is exactly what the LX5 had, without sacrificing the f2.0 lens. My brother needed a new camera anyway and was happy to get my 2 year old LX3. (By the way that camera is in nearly perfect condition. Panasonic really build a quality product with the LX line and I think the LX5 is even better.)Here are the major comparisons to the LX3. Decide if these are worth it to you:- Better image stabilization. I am getting crisp photos at speeds as low as 1/10sec.- Better sensor than the LX3. The colors are slightly more accurate and the auto white balance works better (I need to make less adjustments).- Better low-light shooting. Perfectly usable up to 1600 out of the camera. Shots in ISO 3200-6400 can be used with some photoshopping. ISO 12800 won't be very good, but nice to have if you don't care about quality and just need a quick shot in the dark. With the LX3 I was getting usable shots at ISO 800.- Faster autofocusing.- Face detection.- Autofocus tracking!- Better processor. Faster startup and shot-to-shot time.- Better battery life... this camera lasts almost twice as long!! And I always thought the battery life on the LX3 was already outstanding. I'm going on a weekend trip soon and feel confident that this will last the entire weekend without needing a charge.- As mentioned, the added zoom is terrific. It's interesting to note that the overall size of the camera has remained roughly the same as the LX3 despite the upgrade.- Easier to get into the film mode with the dedicated movie button. I've tested this a few times and it's very useful for quick recording.- Better quality video. Uses the newer avchd codec, but you can always record in motion jpeg.- More comfortable to hold and better build quality.- Hot shoe, but I don't see this as a benefit to myself. The option to add an EVF or flash is nice, but defeats the purpose of keeping this camera compact. At that point you may as well get an SLR.- Better control with the GF1 style click wheel on the back. Seriously, this is the best PaS camera in terms of usability. You literally forget about the controls. Really well thought out. The menus are similar to the LX3 and \"just work\". Really a nice interface and plenty of options to tweak.- Improved screen. Looks better in the bright Singapore sun than my LX3 ever did. Wish it had more pixel density, but still looks great.- Added 1:1 square format is really neat. Not a major addition, but nice to have. I really like that the LX-series has a dedicated image ratio button. Very useful and unique. (note: the LX3 has 1:1 ratio as well, with the latest firmware, but the LX5 has a dedicated hardware button for it).Complaints:- The lens cover needs to be built in. I really don't mind the one it comes with much, but there were lots of complaints about the lens cover on the LX3. Not sure why Panasonic chose to ignore these. I would definitely prefer not to worry about losing the lens cover.- Should be a better panorama mode. I think sony's \"Sweeping panorama\" feature is fantastic. Panasonic should adopt something similar if they can. The current mode works fine, but could be improved.Wish list for the \"LX6\":- Larger sensor, like m4/3.- Brighter lens, F1.7 or lower would be nice :)- Built in EVF!- Articulating screen.- Built in lens cover.- Weather sealed to make it even more durable against splashes and dust.- Manual focus/zoom wheel that can be programmed like the canon S90/95.I think adding these would make for a nearly perfect PaS.Other cameras to consider:Canon S95: I tried this camera out the other day and it's not as good as the LX5 in many ways, but does have a few advantages. Image quality on the S90 was not as good as the LX3/LX5. The LX cams are also wider at 24mm (I think the canons are 28mm). The jog dial on the back of the S95 is cool but since the camera is so small I found myself hitting it accidentally a few times and changing the settings. Can be kind of annoying, especially if you want to take a quick shot. The LX5 is also much nicer to hold and easier to dive into the menus as a result of the control placement. But to be fair, the Canon does start at a lower price point and is smaller. Assuming size and price are more important to you, I would say it makes for a fine choice. It's still better than most other cameras out there and also has an f2.0 lens. The addition of 720p on the S95 is nice as well (but doesn't allow for an AVCHD format, zooming while recording or continuous autofocus like the LX5). Also, having a programmable front selection wheel on the S95 is really smart and useful.Canon G11: Not a big fan of this camera as it uses the same sensor as the Canon S90 and doesn't use as fast a lens. Lacks HD video recording and is more expensive. It's also larger and bulkier than the LX5. Overall I just don't feel like it is a strong competitor. The G12 will probably be something better to compare against the LX5 or any of the other cameras mentioned here. To the G11's credit, it does have an articulating screen and a view finder which is nice.Canon G12: The G12 has since been announced and while it's surely seems like a nice camera I still think it's rather large and didn't add too many features to make it a good competitor to the LX5. It's probably still built like a tank, adds HD recording, but the lens isn't really that impressive to me. The LX5 matches it's zoom capabilities, but with a brighter/wider lense.Olympus EP-L1: This camera is also a worthy competitor and has the benefits of a larger sensor and interchangeable lens. However, the build quality is not as good, the lens that comes with the EP-L1 isn't very impressive and it's a bit larger. You will need to spend some serious money on the 20mm f1.8 lens which makes this purchase almost twice that of the LX5. If you are okay with the kit lens this is a great bargain for just slightly more than the LX5.Pansonic GF1: This was the most difficult decision to make for me. Relatively speaking, the GF1 costs slightly more than the LX5, but comes with a better lens (20mm f1.8) and is m4/3 like the EP-L1. While the 20mm kit the GF1 does take noticeably better pictures, I still ended up choosing the LX5. Why? The LX5 is still cheaper (the price difference does matter to me, it might not to you), has image stabilization (the GF1 does not) and it's substantially smaller. I like the GF1 and think it is tiny compared to traditional digital SLRs, but it's still not as convenient as a compact PaS like the LX5. Basically, I see myself taking the LX5 to more places and using it more in general. I think that beats out the image quality edge that the GF1 has.Ricoh GR Digital III: Looks interesting and has a nice spec'd 28mm f1.9 lens, but is fixed (no zoom) and has no HD video recording. I didn't test this because I need zoom and HD recording, and it's also larger and a good amount more expensive than the LX5. I've heard the menu system on the Ricoh's is one of the best to use, but it seems to be targeted at a very niche audience.Samsung TL500: Was really impressed and seriously considered this camera because I read about it having a f1.8 lens at 24mm! And it has a nice articulating AMOLED screen. I played with the camera a bit and was impressed, but it's larger than the LX5, doesn't have as good a zoom range and about 1/2 the battery life. I've also examined the TL500 image samples on the web and don't think they are good as the LX5. Low light performance is a little less impressive, but the LX5 just produces more crisp images with better colors IMO. This is comparing jpg's straight out of the camera, not RAW files. Lastly, there is no HD video recording (only does 480p). The price on this camera is great though and it looks and feels like it will last a LONG time. Great design here by samsung.Sony NEX3/5: Gorgeous cameras for sure. First I've seen that come with a metal kit lens. This oozes quality and I really wanted to like these cameras. With the pancake lens they are fairly tiny and remember they use a full size APS-C sensor. Also, the NEX3 is not much more expensive than an LX5. I didn't purchase either for a few reasons. First, the flash isn't built in. You need to screw it on, which is annoying because it doesn't go on easily. It took me a few tries to get the threading to interlock. I don't take off too many points for this, because you can just leave the flash attached all the time. The biggest problem I have is the manual functionality and the firmware in general is lacking and isn't very fluid. This is also partially a result of the sparse manual controls the cameras have. It's hard to adjust any settings and really seems to be designed for users who want to just use the auto mode. This is completely OK, just not the camera for me. If you purchase this camera and intend to use the manual functionality (and don't mind digging around the menu a bit) I'm confident this camera will give you excellent results. You also get the great Sony \"sweep\" panorama mode I wish Panasonic would implement. And let's not forget the useful tilt screen. Out of the two, the NEX3 (the NEX5 adds 1080p video) is probably the most direct competitor to the LX5 in terms of price and could be a good choice for many people. Like I said, I really wanted to like these cameras, but the controls and software feel a bit like a rush job.Conclusion:After weighing the LX5 against the competition I think overall it's the most balanced camera out there and a worthy successor to the classic LX3.If you're willing to sacrifice some features and IQ, but need a cheaper camera with a fast lens and with smaller size go for the Canon S90/95.The LX3 still competes with most of the cameras mentioned and is a terrific bargain. I'd definitely recommend looking into getting one if you're a bit tight on cash, but want a great camera that will last years and years.If you don't mind being able to record video and are willing to sacrifice some IQ look at the Samsung TL500, it has even faster glass than the LX5 and offers some unique features like an articulating AMOLED screen. Overall an excellent value for what you get.The Sony NEX3 produces great results with it's larger sensor and is an interchangeable lens system for a price that's very close to the LX5. But it lacks manual functionality and has an awkward to use flash component.Finally, if you want SLR-like image quality and are willing to pay a bit more, look at the Panasonic GF1. The 20mm kit will take amazing photos but you get a less compact camera, no zoom, no image stabilization, and of course the higher price for a camera that's already about 1 year old.Hope this was helpful.Additional Notes:I discovered that if you hold the \"play\" button while turning the camera on, it will bypass extending the zoom and go straight into picture review mode.

I am a professional photographer and have been searching for a quality point & shoot for casual use when I don't want to lug around my DSLR (Nikon D700 at the moment) but have never been happy with the compromises of a P&S.; Some of the features that were most important to me for a P&S; were:- RAW files - LX5 can shoot RAW files to allow changing WB and giving maximum flexibility in editing images in my preferred RAW converter, Lightroom 3.- Fast glass - f/2 lens!!  Even at 90mm, it is still f/3.3!- Wide-angle - 24mm (35mm equivalent) is awesome, the Canon S90 only goes to 28mm and most P&S; no wider than 35mm.- Decent zoom range - I wasn't interested in a 10x superzoom but wanted something at least to 70 or 80 mm.  The zoom range of 24mm to 90mm is just perfect without compromising the quality and speed of the lens.- Reasonable compactness - it is fairly compact without feeling like I'm handling a bar of soap.  It handles well for a P&S; and feels like a real quality piece of equipment.  The controls are logically placed with controls for the most commonly used adjustments within easy and quick access.  Not as pocketable as most compact P&S; cameras, but has the best handling of a P&S; I've ever used.- Low light sensitivity - I almost never shoot with the on-camera flash, so low light sensitivity is really important to me.  I've shot images up to ISO 1000 that clean up quite well in LR3.  I even feel that ISO 1600 is usable in a pinch if you aren't going to blow it up too large.- Manual controls - I love that I can set everything manually: aperture, shutter speed, ISO and the controls make it quick and easy to do so without digging into the menus.- Sharp, high quality images - I have been blown away by the quality of the lens on the LX5.  I've taken shots wide open at f/2 and was very surprised at the quality, and sharpness of the images.  They seriously rival images from my DSLR with some of my pro f/2.8 lenses.Some other things to note:- Has effective image stabilization.  I've taken sharp photos at 1/10 sec.- Shoots 720p video in AVCHD- Has hotshoe to attach an electronic viewfinder, flash, or radio trigger (like a Pocket Wizard)- Has a small pop-up flash- Has a removable lens cap that many complained about on the LX3.  I actually don't mind since I am used to having to remove it with my DSLRs.- Can shoot in a number of different aspect ratios: square, 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9- Can quickly go from play (review) mode to shooting mode with a quick tap of the shutter release button- Can add filters and lens converters with an adapter- All metal body - it feels really nice in the handOne thing I really wish it had was some way to remotely trigger the camera.  There is no infrared shutter release or a manual shutter release available for it.  It does have the usual timer mode.I considered a micro 4/3 camera such as a Panasonic GF1 or Olympus EP2 but the size with the lens approaches that of the smaller DSLRs.  I bought a Canon S90 but returned it because the handling was just terrible.  It was too small, had no hand grip and had a finnicky dial.  Also, the image quality and sharpness were not nearly as good as the LX5.  I've only briefly borrowed a friend's LX3 but I didn't use it enough to provide a comparison besides looking at the specs and reading the reviews.Overall, I highly recommend the LX5 if you are in the market for a serious photographer's P&S; camera.  No, it won't replace a DSLR if you need the ultimate image quality and speed, but within the context of a P&S;, it fits the bill nearly perfectly for me.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Depends What You're Looking For", "Author": "Koytch", "ReviewID": "R2DZG2ICPOOXOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I said \"Depends on What You're Looking For\" because everyone has their own expectations and needs.  In my case, all my DSLRs have been Nikon, and all my small pocket cameras have been Canon.  I was in the market for a new pocket camera since my others didn't have optical image stabilization.  So I bought another small Canon, and for some reason, just not as pleased anymore (I ended up giving to my wife and she loves it).  I must admit I'm picky on quality of the image, high ISO capability, and having some control over camera setting.A friend of mine had been looking at DSLRs, but bought the LX5 and asked what I thought about it.  The more I reviewed and analyzed it, the more I liked it.  So I bought one.  It's close to a pocket size camera, but a little larger.  Though the specs say 4.3 inch x 2.6 inch x 1 inch, that is true, but just for the body itself.  The lens with lens cap adds another inch sticking out.  So the body is OK, but a little bigger than I previously would purchase for casual carry around shooting.  But, it's still not that large overall, and fits in jacket pockets, larger pants pockets just fine.So after using this camera, I changed my outlook.  Why?  Because this camera met my expectations of high quality images, high ISO capability, and having control over all aspects (but I found automatic mode produces outstanding images also, so it's a win-win on this camera).  This camera is the first compact I ever owned that produces superb images which I don't find myself complaining about.  The images actually look like the original scene.  Exposure control is excellent, focusing is accurate, images look great, and the camera is easy to use.  For being picky, I really haven't found a complaint yet.  Lumix did a good job on this one.Even though this camera has a hot shoe on top for an external flash, I don't buy compacts for that reason, normally wouldn't care if one was there anyway.  I would use my DSLR for that purpose.  However, that's me, so I took my Nikon SB800 flash (which is 3 times the size of the camera) and stuck it on the LX5.  I put the camera in Aperture priority mode, set the f/stop and set the flash accordingly.  No problem.  Everything worked very well.  Though you can't expect to get a computerized camera to flash operation that a dedicated Panasonic flash would give you, it does mean you can use whatever flash you want on the camera and get good photos.  (I posted one under customer images using the Nikon flash).So it does depend on what you're looking for in a camera that suits your needs, in my case, this camera does excellent and very pleased with it.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could be really good, BUT...", "Author": "Soured Customer \"Soured Customer\"", "ReviewID": "R2JVCW2LOOXAU1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "...the quality is completely inconsistent.  I have now purchased four, count them: 1, 2, 3, 4 of these cameras.The first one was returned because every image had a greenish yellow tint that was unnatural and could not be eliminated through white balance adjustment.  So, I returned it and ordered camera number two.  This one seemed to take great photos all around.  However, the glass on the the lcd, within a couple of days, was loose and wobbled around.  Strike two.  Well, let's call it a foul tip.  RMA.  I ordered camera number three.  This time, I ordered it in white instead of black, hoping maybe they come from different production facilities and may have different revisions of the build components or better quality control.  Nope.  Camera number three had exactly the same issue as number one - greenish yellow tinted photos.  Returned.  I just got camera number four.  The pictures are outstanding, BUT it has the same issue as camera number two with the loose glass on the back.  What gives?  Seriously.  This is ridiculous.You'd think I'd just order another brand altogether.  However, I've already tried the Canon S95, and this Panasonic blows it away.  It's much much faster (what's the point of having a camera if you miss the shot because the camera doesn't react in time), the low light ability is far superior, the macro is wonderful, it can zoom while recording video, and the battery life is excellent.  It has the potential to be a great camera, if only it was built better.

Arggghhh!!!", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Perfect Compact Camera", "Author": "Anthony Ruggeri \"hard to pin down\"", "ReviewID": "R3F3YF2SZO7V0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm mainly an SLR shooter (Nikon D70, D200, D300), and I've been looking for a long time for an acceptable compact camera to have with me everywhere -- while walking, biking, on business trips, or even side trips on vacation when I don't want to lug around my SLR.  With the emerging choices in micro 4/3 and the latest crop of \"enthusiast\" compact cameras, I figured it was time to make a decision.  I have no regrets about choosing the LX5.The two things that really stand out on the LX5 are the lens and the overall handling speed.The lens is the real deal at 24-90 35mm equivalent and f/2-f/3.3.  You won't find a better lens on a compact camera. I'm mainly shooting landscapes and static subjects, so the range is perfect.  The optical stabilization works very well, and the fast aperture of the lens helps tremendously in low-light situations.The overall handling speed stands out particularly against some of its compact camera competition.  I was a little worried at first when I was doing tests and shooting RAW to internal memory, which is quite slow, but once I added a class 10 SDHC card, that concern vanished.  Everything responds quickly -- switches and dials, the menu, and (of course) actually taking pictures.  The Q Menu is a very fast and easy way to change settings.  I always shoot RAW because I think the difference is worth it, and this camera can handle it.Although I got the optional viewfinder, it's mediocre and the ergonomics of holding a tiny camera up to my face aren't as much like using an SLR as I thought they would be, so I might get rid of the viewfinder.  Finding a spare battery for sale was also tough, but I did eventually find one in stock on Amazon.Here's my assessment of the LX5 against other cameras I was evaluating at the same time:Canon S95 - while the S95 is definitely smaller and a bit more portable than the LX5, I preferred the more serious feel of the LX5, particularly its grip.  The much-discussed click wheel on the S95 I found to be overrated.  Compared to an SLR rig, a small belt bag for the LX5 is portable enough.  Viewing pictures taken by the S95, the lens didn't seem as good as that on the LX5 - more chromatic abberation (purple fringing) and soft corners.Nikon P7000 - as a Nikon shooter, I really wanted to like the P7000.  Ergonomically its functions are similar to an SLR, and it would have been compatible with accessories such as my Nikon flashes.  On the other hand, how often am I really going to want a big flash on a tiny camera?  The killer for me with the P7000 was the overall speed.  It's sluggish.  It responds slowly to various controls and has a well-known problem writing RAW files. These are things that would drive me nuts after an extended period of time.  It also has a slower lens.Canon G12 - I was only going to go with a larger camera if I got the P7000, so I never really considered the G12 seriously.Samsung TL500 - might be the closest competitor to the LX5 in capabilities, but it was hard to find one to try, and I really had no use for the articulating screen.Panasonic GF1 - would have been my first choice micro 4/3, if I went with micro 4/3.  I didn't because zoom lenses are still big, even the Olympus collapsible kit zoom, and I definitely wanted a zoom lens.  With a pancake prime the GF1 is almost as small as the LX5, and would have better image quality, but a single focal length is not compatible (for me) with a general-purpose camera.Olympus PEN - just like the GF1, the lenses are too big.Sony NEX - again, big lenses.Nikon D3100 - I never seriously considered any of the smaller true SLRs.  Even with the smallest lenses, they're a lot bigger than the LX5.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "I have found my Holy Grail", "Author": "DJPeebs \"DJPeebz\"", "ReviewID": "R3G0RKGA5VPXH4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Two years ago, I would have bet and lost a large sum of money that I would NOT own a Panasonic camera by 2010. I had been a Minolta man for 37 years switching my allegiance to Canon when on that sad day Minolta stopped its camera business. I take photography VERY seriously as a hobby and by nature do not like to compromise with the tools I use to create. Therefore, my cameras are sacred instruments...Acknowledging that I was in the market specifically for an advanced and easily portable compact camera, I waited many months before finally choosing a replacement for my beloved Canon SX-20 after its lens was irretrievably scratched. During this prolonged period of time, I asked many, many questions of many, many 'experts'; read countless online & print reviews and made scores of trips to B&H; Photo in NYC for hours of hands-on exploration of a large number of camera makes and models, before deciding to buy the LX5. I've only had the camera for three days and have taken just 200 pictures, yet I will not hesitate to state that the LX5 has already surpassed my highest expectations. In its brief time in my possession, the LX5 has become my FAVORITE ALL-TIME (set lens) camera to date.Immediately I was positively impacted by the LX5's construction, which is simply immaculate -- built mainly from metal, it has an incredibly sturdy feel that is much more akin to an old school rangefinder than to all other sub-DSLR cameras today. This is undeniable.As a Canon user, I immediately found the LX5 controls to be fully intuitive, although I must admit I'm still learning ALL of the menu controls as I crave manual control and creative flexibility! The LX 5 delivers on both points.The f2.0 Leica lens is stunning and the pictures range from perfectly acceptable to superb, in my initial tests, up to and including ISO 1250 (with ISO 12800 max!). RAW format provides jaw-dropping quality and Panasonic's Venus JPEG engine maintains excellent quality. The LX5 has raised the bar to a level beyond anything I've ever experienced with ANY similar cameras available today.And the LX5 fits in my front pants pocket, albeit not as well as the Canon S95 would if camera size had been my main concern.I evaluated it's supposed \"cons\" and have no problem whatsoever living with its \"lacking Burst mode\"; the non-optimal electronic user manual and the lens cap (see the excellent lens cap solution towards the end of this review). As far as I'm concerned, I have not yet found any glaring problems or 'deal breakers'. For what it is, in it's specific digital camera niche, Panasonic friggin' nailed the LX5!I'll see if, over time and in varying situations, my results fully justify these initial comments, but ultimately no matter the extent to which its perceived (but as yet personally undiscovered) deficiencies become apparent, I will be no less thrilled that I waited as long as it took me to find the EXACT functionality I desired in a digital camera.If the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 is seriously in your decision mix, I can guarantee that you'll NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with the LX5 and will MOST LIKELY BE BLOWN AWAY.UPDATE, 11/14/10 -I love my first pictures! If you're interested, there is a link to the very first pictures I took with my LX5 in the comments to my review below. I continued to be impressed by the LX5's lowlight capabilities as I prefer to use natural light whenever possible.I have also discovered that not all LCD screen protectors are created equal and when it comes to the LX5, the best by far is the 14-layer GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector: GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector for Leica D-lux 4 and Panasonic Lx-3 Digital CamerasUPDATE, 12/15/10 -The ultimate solution to the lens cap inconvenience is the RainbowImaging Auto Lens Cap:RainbowImaging Auto Lens Cap for PANASONIC LUMIX DMC LX5 LX-5 (Black), with a free lens penThis item fully satisfies the overriding desire not to manually detach/re-attach the lens cap. Another testament to the LX-5's well-crafted design, the lens threads are concealed directly under the outer lens ring, which simply screws off, allowing the lens cap (and lens adapters) to be screwed solidly on to the camera.UPDATE, 01/07/11 -I adore this camera. I carry it in my left pocket at all times and have effortlessly captured some of life's great moments in vivid color and crisp detail.UPDATE, 03/14/12 -After over 10,000 pictures, my camera operates perfectly in every aspect. If anything, now that I know each and every feature and setting intimately, I have maximized my mastery of the LX-5. As far as wear and tear go, I have always treated my electronics as prized possessions. That said, with as much as I have used my camera the picture format/size designations on top of the lens ring (directly under the hot shoe) is worn and over time a couple of the designations have been scratched out from the camera rubbing against something in my backpack. Other than that, it is in absolutely superb condition.What is now transpiring is that I am ready to migrate upwards to a camera that can give me substantially more quality and flexibility. So I have purchased a brand new Canon G1-X Canon G1 X 14.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom Lens Full 1080p HD Video and 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD. My LX-5 will then be relegated as a secondary (and much more portable) sidekick to the G1-X. I guess it follows that in a couple of years from now, I'll dive into a high-end DSLR, with two backup cameras at my disposal.Enjoy and savor!", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "LOVE that Leica Lens!", "Author": "GG", "ReviewID": "R3M4DKWY8KDTCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (White)I have worked with quite a few high-end point-and-shoot cameras during the course of a few years.  This camera I feel I can give without hesitation 5 stars.  I have nothing bad to say about the LX5.  I am reviewing this camera from a layman's point-of-view and not a professional's.  I am sure a pro will find faults.  This is what I see.  The Leica lens in the LX5 seems to produce much sharper images than the Canon S90 and G11.  Strangely, the images also seem sharper than my Sony Nex 5.  In fact, in some cases, the Nex 5's photos seemed disappointly soft in comparison.  LX5 colors are perfectly saturated but not too much - just enough to make the image pop.  White balance seems right on most of the time.I recently took photos in the dark of amusement rides  at a local fair.  I compared the LX5 photos with ones I took last year with the Sony WX1 and what a difference!  The LX5 on iA produced sharp, bright images with no noise vs. the WX1, which even with hand-held-twilight, had softer and more washed-out images but also without noise.  (Of course, there is a big difference in camera prices, and the WX1 is still a decent camera.)I also compared the LX5' s AVCHD video mono with a camera that takes 1080i with stereo.  The LX5's color seemed more natural (no bluish tinge) and the mono, I believe, might have sounded better than the stereo of the other camera which lacked a deeper base.The LX5 allows for many adjustments the photographer can make in both stills and video to suit his/her taste.

The LX5 seems to have much more accurate color..skin tones overall look near perfect now..dynamic range REALLY is improved and EXCELLENT for a small camera, Highlight clipping or lack of, is REALLY good on the LX5 for such a small sensor (vs a dslr micro 4/3/nex etc. Battery life so far seems really great..another real improvement over the LX3. A couple of cons are..indoors in low light..you still get too much noise for a $499 camera? Actually the LX5 is the best I have seen in a small camera noise wise...well actually maybe the S90 was a little cleaner. I think we have to face facts..you are NOT going to be in the same ball park as a micro 4/3 or the Sony NEX which is a full sized sensor..it's scientifically impossible..or so it seems. \"But\" noise levels are very VERY GOOD on the LX5, just no where near what a dslr or NEX5, GF1 can output etc. I took a star off cause THEY advertise these small cameras like they are going to act like a DSLR indoors...it's simply NOT going to happen!OVERALL though this LX5 is near amazing in what it can do..GREAT lens...I see little or no Chromatic aberration(Purple Fringing) and the lens seems to be very sharp corner to corner. Now back to the title of my review. I also recently bought the Samsung TL500...and not too long ago owned the Canon S90 I can't comment on the S95. The TL500's screen ABSOLUTELY looks WAY better, brighter, and more ACCURATE than the LX5's screen..especially indoors. Believe me I had both cameras side by side!The fact that the TL500'S screen can be moved in any position just magnifies it's superiority. I didn't really believe the specs that the TL500'S 1.8 aperture would REALLY make things brighter using a lower ISO but it's true..I took at least 20 side by side pics...the TL500 lens definitely brings in more light at SAME iso. ALL that being said..I like the LX5 more as it seems much more refined...there is much more control..I love that you can choose isos like 320, 500, 640, etc. So the LX5 seems to be the slightly better camera if you want the MOST control..ala coming from a real DSLR. The TL500 is pretty close, but has an overall ODD thing that SOME things..be it face detection for example may then block out 4-5 other features that are now greyed out, Besides being limited..you never know WHICH TL500 feature is going to knock out 2-3 other features you MAY want to access.Well the point of all the TL500 features (in an LX5 review) are IF you can live with the fact that some features turn off when you turn other features ON, OVERALL to my eyes..the OVERALL output of these cameras are EXTREMELY similar. The LX5's pics look a bit sharper, better dynamic range, and highlights and shadow are superior..Slightly. But the TL500 can stand pretty much toe to toe with the LX5. TL500 is built like a TANK, LX5 is also very well built too..JUST not tank like. The \"TL500 is currently $150 less\"! hence my 4 stars here again.. The reason I sold my Canon S90 is I looked pink-ish in 90% of the photos..plus it had really limited dynamic range..and even with messing with exposure compensation way too many of my pictures had blown highlights...and too much purple fringing. The LX5 to my eyes is nearly in a different league than the S90 hence I did not even consider the S95 as the S90 really turned me off (Just my opinion and the way I SAW the output).If I had to choose ONE camera, the LX5 is the overall balanced BEST output winner here. That being said I plan to keep my TL500 and give it to my wife so I can still use it. :) It has an IT factor..it's DIFFERENT, you will fall in love with it's oled screen and it's construction. But when you are done PLAYING...and want the overall BEST pictures, I have to say the LX5 is the best pocket-able camera out there today (In my opinion)..by a small margin. As I wrote in my TL500 review, if you REALLY want small.the CANON S90 and even more with the S95, are TRULY pocket able and great cameras too, but blown highlights,Pink-ish skin tones, somewhat limited dynamic range will drive you crazy. The LX5 and TL500 with lens cap are just a bit larger..but I feel worth the extra inch and ounce or two.. Let me say though, These are just my opinions, and what my eyes have told me, perhaps YOU may see things a bit differently. No mater what I can't see anyone unhappy with the LX5, Just wish it were $100 less then it would be the true knock out king, dollar for dollar!", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why I chose this camera over the Canon S95", "Author": "John M. Munsch", "ReviewID": "R2ESYMPRZ94QEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Buying this camera involved the really hard choice between this camera and the also (apparently) excellent Canon S95. Both are 10MP compact cameras but the Canon is even smaller and lighter weight, so it begs the question, \"Why buy this instead of the Canon?\"I often use my compact camera as a video solution too. While I have a nice dedicated digital camcorder (the Canon Vixia HF100), when I only want to carry around one camera and take lots of good quality stills as well as video, I need a camera that does both well. This camera has two things in particular that put its video suitability for me ahead of the Canon.First is that it has a dedicated video button; mash the button, start taking video. No need to put the dial into some special mode before you can start shooting video. That makes it even more likely that you will take videos and you will capture the right moments when you do. Second is that it allows the use of zoom while recording video. The inability to zoom into something or out from something to capture the bigger picture is a crazy limitation that many compacts like the S95 and my older Lumix LZ10 have. Often it's to keep lens noise off of the audio on the recording but really, shouldn't that be my decision whether I'm willing to live with that or not. In the end, Panasonic seems to have settled on the compromise of just making the zoom be slower during video so you don't end up with lens noise.Having just had the pleasure of using this camera for a five day vacation in New York City I can say that I am super pleased with the results. Low light results were fantastic for such a small camera. I basically left the flash off for the entire trip and got plenty of shots in restaurants, bars, stores, and even Radio City Music Hall that would have been a grainy mess with my old Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ10 or I could have gotten OK with my Canon Rebel XT but I would have been lugging around something that was five times the bulk and twice (or more) the weight. This slipped nicely into the pocket of my coat and got me great shot after great shot. As some people wiser than me have said, the best camera of all is the camera you actually have with you.Note how fast the lens is even at the top end of it's range: 3.3. That's as fast at the top end of its range as the kit lens that came with my Rebel XT is at the bottom of its zoom range and faster than the one on the Canon S95 at the top end of its range as well. That additional light helps make for better pictures.Note: There are some caveats you should know. First is that there are some tools like Google's Picasa that do not support as of Dec 2011 the RAW image format of the LX5. Adobe Lightroom 3 had no problem with them though. Likewise the AVCHD Lite format it uses for recording video is not yet supported by all tools either. While I've been able to play all of the video with ease using VLC, I think if I needed to edit the video I'd have to first convert it to a different format before iMovie would be able to work with it. Also worth noting is that it is not a great pocket camera if your idea of a pocket is your jeans pocket. Because the lens is outside the body of the camera, it is bulkier than a tiny compact like the S95. However it is plenty small enough to fit easily in a jacket pocket, a purse, or just carry in your hand without ever being annoying.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "LX5 -Excellent camera for outdoor photography", "Author": "Vinoy Kadavunkal", "ReviewID": "R35G9RUPVDDOWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer.

Of retirement age, I shoot mainly landscapes, travel, people pictures. I live in Southern Arizona with lots of bright light.The reasons why the Panasonic LX5 was my obvious choice for a camera that added features I was missing on my other two and had not found on any other camera on the market at the time of purchase (mid-September, 2010):I had good experience with Panasonic digital cameras, their power management, and with Leica-designed lensesFor outdoor shots, an LCD viewfinder almost never works satisfactorily where I live, and the LX5 offers an attachable, variable viewing angle ELECTRONIC LIVE VIEWFINDER (DMW-LVF1) for less than $150 (street) that displays the LCD screen and can be easily switched back and forth with the LCD display. Since the viewfinder attaches to the hot shoe, an accessory electronic flash cannot be attached at the same time. However, the pop-up built-in flash still works.The optical viewfinder (DMW-VF1) offered by Panasonic does not correspond to the actual image except in the wide angle setting.A POLARIZATION FILTER has been the most significant image-enhancing feature I have been missing from my SLR/DSLR days, and its effect is not achievable in Photoshop.  The LX5 offers a practical solution by means of a tube that can be screwed on to the base of the lens (DMW-LA6). It is long enough to allow for the zoom lens extension. It features a 52 mm diameter threat for attaching a circular-polarized filter or any other filter, as well as a wide-angle conversion lens.Attaching and removing this adapter, or the electronic viewfinder, makes the camera system less convenient to use or carry, but I definitely want these two options and am willing to take the extra time or carry camera and accessories in a small bag when I am likely to use them. It's still much lighter than a DSLR. When I know I won't use these attachments, the camera is pocketable. However, I always carry it in a small bag for protection.There is an ergonomic issue when using the tube plus pol filter attached and even, but to a slightly lesser degree, when they are not being used. With the principal controls (shutter release, zoom lever, mode dial) on the right side, and because of the body grip (protrusion) on the right forward end of the camera body, the camera wants to be held firmly with one's right hand and steadied at the left side. The gripping forces on the right side want to be counter-reacted by thumb pressure on the rear of the camera body. However, that is the area where all the control buttons are located. Bummer! With the tube plus pol filter attached, one needs even a firmer grip with the right hand since the left hand (fingers) are needed, at least temporarily, for rotating the pol filter. One should always use a lanyard for a small and expensive device like this camera, but that does not help much in finding a firm grip. When I take over the Panasonic design department we will work on that! In the meantime, make sure you use the camera Leica 18151 D-Lux 5 Digital Cameralanyard in case the camera slips out of your hands. I am willing to accept this design flaw, for now...Optical performance:I display my images on a 22\" monitor or on a 40\" Sony Bravia hi-def TV. So far I have made \"non-scientific\" comparisons on these media with side-by-side shots taken outdoors in bright sunlight with the Panasonic-made Leica D-Lux3 (with a Leitz-designed DC Vario Elmarit) and the Panasonic LX5 (with a Leitz-designed DC Vario Summicron). They were comparable in quality. A friend of mine snapped a few shots inside my Starbucks in available light without the built-in flash, some with bright light from the windows. Result: a major WOW effect! Have not seen that quality on any of my other cameras. I am sure I will enjoy the lens' performance in low-light scenarios.The AVCHD motion picture mode is of low importance to me. I had good experience with the Leica D-Lux3 at a house concert. I only wish Panasonic would offer an optional receptacle for a stereo mike.Accessory electronic flash:I am sure I will occasionally use the provided hot shoe with flash. I will probably use, occasionally, a slave to trigger an off-camera flash. I wonder why on expensive cameras such as the Leica D-Lux3 and the Panasonic LX5 a flash sync terminal could not provided.Lens cover:Some make negative remarks about the clip-on lens cover on the LX5. An expensive camera deserves the extra step, besides - this cover comes with a lanyard! What did you do with your SLR or DSLR lenses?Overall:The LX5 is a versatile and sophisticated camera. One must study all functions thoroughly. When I take over the Panasonic design department, the instruction manual will be more specific and will be in one language! I don't always travel with a netbook computer.If one decides, after careful evaluation, the `extra' features (low-light, high-quality lens, life electronic viewfinder, attachment for pol or other filters) are a requirement, then the Panasonic LX5 with Leitz-designed Vario Summicron is a great camera.Panasonic now (January 2011) offers this camera as Leica D-Lux 5 for $800 thru Amazon, and the Panasonic LX5 went down in price to $400. I recommend NOT to buy the Leica. I opted to buy the Leice D-Lux3 a few years ago over its Panasonic equivalent but nobody noticed the little red dot, not even in the motherland of Leica! It is a major rip-off, charging double for camera and accessories, just for re-labeling the identical hardware, in my humble opinion.I hope this review is helpful.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "A nice camera with some jpeg issues", "Author": "aethelraed", "ReviewID": "R2MTY7XJ52OMA6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful little camera, ideal for those who want to take a camera everywhere, but cannot, or do not want to lug around an SLR with additional lenses. I replaced my Olympus E-P1 with it, keeping my Olympus SLR for critical work, because, though the build and picture quality of the Olympus micro 4/3 system is superb, I wanted a quality pocketable camera to supplement my E-510.Much has been made about the difference, or lack of it, between this camera and its Leica branded twin, the D-Lux 5. Having owned the Leica D-lux 4 previously, I would not have hesitated to buy the updated version could I have afforded to do so. The Leica jpeg quality is outstanding out of camera at the default settings and I do not like the Silkypix raw software included with the Panasonic -- and never have. That being said, the Panasonic can be tweaked to produce decent jpegs, especially at lower iso settings, and after buying the LX5 and its LVF 1 eyelevel viewfinder for $550 here at Amazon, I still had $250 of the $800 I would have paid for the Leica to buy the $299 Adobe Lightroom software included with the latter. On my present budget, the choice was obvious.Still, I do not stand with those who rail against Leica purchasers. The resale value of the Leica is far greater -- a real consideration for those of us who sell used equipment regularly in order to upgrade -- and I sold my 2 year old used D-lux 4 for $500 at a time when its Panasonic cousin was selling used for a pittance. There are good reasons for buying both cameras, depending on one's needs, budget, future buying plans, etc.About the Panasonic jpegs that are often criticized harshly: My experience indicates that the culprit is too aggressive in camera noise reduction, applied with an algorithm that also then sharpens the mush it creates, producing very ugly results. If one turns the noise reduction to -2, however, as low as it will go, the results, at least to iso 400, can be quite pleasing. Non-customizable in camera noise filtration, remains, and any resulting noise is well under control up to iso 400 (maybe 800, depending on your tolerance for \"grain\" -- mine is high). 100% side by side comparisons of jpegs made in camera at that setting, with contrast and sharpness at 0 and saturation at -1, gave results that were perfectly acceptable . Others may find settings more to their liking, but I do advise turning in camera noise reduction down if you are going to use the jpegs right from the camera. Setting noise reduction to minus 2, however, does not seem to turn it off, and at higher iso settings it kicks in too aggressively for my liking, and the raw file becomes a necessary option for any use beyond small (8x10 or so) email files. I cannot compare it to the D-lux 5 jpeg engine, but against my D-lux 4 the jpegs in the Panasonic, while they can be made better with tweaking, are simply not as good, nor are they as consistent. The issue is not a deal breaker, but Panasonic does still have problems with its jpegs. Those who can get by with considerable loss of detail in order to make noise vanish may like it better.The bells and whistles -- program modes, etc. -- are not things I use, so you'll have to go elsewhere to find out about them. The high resolution LCD screen gives very little visual feedback as to how the final result will appear on your computer screen, so set contrast, etc. for your final result, not the in-camera preview. The electronic, eye-level viewfinder does the job and has a nice, though loose, diopter adjustment wheel, but if you are expecting a stunning image preview, you will be disappointed by its relatively low video resolution.The camera can produce stunning results if you take the time to tweak its settings to your liking, and particularly if you take the time to develop raw files, which are amazing good for a small sensor camera, and the look of which can be personalized to one's own tastes. I always shoot raw plus super fine jpeg and go back to the raw file for anything I am going to print. If one does not want to do that, a lower grade point and shoot like the ZS5 -- or the costlier D-lux 5 -- would be a more sensible investment. But overall, I give this little camera very high marks indeed.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's OK but not amazing", "Author": "Marshall", "ReviewID": "R7VDHURXQHLHW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this camera I considered the S95 (canon) and the G12 as they were then the only available point and shoots with wide lenses and full manual control. I read a lot of reviews and tested the three cameras at a store and finally decided to get the LX5 because of superior handling over the s95 and compact size compared the G12. In general am happy with the camera, however there are a number of drawbacks that make it less than perfect for my typical usage patterns. Below I expand with some thoughts that drove my decision making process and the reasons behind my 3 stars rating.1) Compact: I wanted something I could carry in a pocket during long walking tours or long hikes when a DSLR would be too bulky and heavy, or conspicuous. At the same time something not too small because I find small cameras to be uncomfortable and often awkward to handle. The G12 dropped out of the race at this stage as it is too large. The S95, on the other hand was too small. In this regard the Lumix LX5 was perfect being small enough but still comfortable to use... unless you plan to use filters. In which case you need the relatively large adapter that turns this camera into the size of a small 4/3 system without the advantages.2) Manual control: I wanted full manual control and in this regard the camera is also great (as the S95 and G12). Everything is easy to control with little or no interaction with the menus. Aperture and shutter speed are right there at your fingertips and other functions such as white balance, flash control, and exposure compensation can be accessed from quick menu really easy. You can customize one of the buttons to access a function directly, which in my case I use for exposure bracketing. As with all point and shoot cameras, manual focus is a pain to use but the autofocus has been reliable for me. In general, I am very happy with the controls and my only complain is the scroll wheel is a little bit to stiff for my taste.3) Versatility: I like the ability to use filters on a point and shoot every now and then and I am pleased I can do that with this camera. The adapter tube is long to allow for the lens to fully extend, so you loose some compactness factor. Attaching the tube is not hard but I found is not something I want to do on the spot because it takes a few tries to align the threads of the adapter tube to the camera to screw it into position. More than once it took me a few minutes to get the threads true. With this said, the tube takes standard filters and you don't need to buy the -expensive- panasonic ones.4) Wide angle and low light: This was a key selling point because I missed the ability of shooting wide angle photos as my previous PS had a 38mm equivalent focal length at the wide end. I also wanted the ability of shooting in low light conditions without flash or without a tripod. In this end the results are a mixed bag and the 3 stars rating comes mainly from this section. The 24mm equivalent lens is great... however, it introduces a lot of distortion and after the initial enthusiasm I find myself falling back to shooting wide at 28mm or so. Now, there are two prices to pay for the 24mm wide lens which am not too happy with, especially compared with the 28mm of the S95. First is the reduced zoom reach: both the S95 and LX5 have a 3.8x range, but the S95 starts 28mm and goes to 105mm whereas the LX5 starts at 24 and ends at 90mm. The difference is actually noticeable and now that I don't use 24mm that much, it is annoying. The other problem is that this lens has 2.0 aperture at 24mm, but it goes up quickly as you zoom in. The S95 has 2.0 at 28mm, which again, now that I don't use 24 that much makes this camera less than ideal for me. In retrospect, I think I probably would have been better served by the S95 lens, although the ergonomics of S95 (too small) was a key factor why I did not purchase it.5) As other reviewers pointed out, the jpegs out of the camera are not pleasant. Colors are dull and noise reduction is not to my taste. I've been shooting in \"dynamic\" mode, which produces more vibrant colors but still not happy with the jpeg quality. The solution is to shoot raw and do some post-processing but this is not what I bought this camera for... When I do casual shooting I rarely have to time/interest to go and do some serious post-processing.6) The low light ability of the camera is good, but anything above ISO 400 is unusable (really bad)... and 400 is pushing it, since you have to shoot raw and then do judicious noise reduction according to your needs and shooting conditions. On the other hand, I can do hand-held shooting in moderately low light situations where I would not even try with other point and shoots.7) This camera is not for close up photography and the limited zoom makes it pretty useless for macro. Minimum focusing distance is less than a couple of cm at 24mm but it goes up very quickly as you increase the focal length. At 24mm there is a lot of distortion (can be corrected with photoshop) which makes the camera even less suitable for this kind of photography.8) Noise: I don't know if it is my copy, but especially in JPEG mode, dark areas show a lot of noise even at low iso when looking at pixel level. I do use serious cropping every now and then and this has become a problem. Related to this, the resolution at pretty much every focal length is not all that good, even compared with lesser point and shoot cameras. Again, I don't know if this is a problem with my particular camera, but when looked at high magnification, edges are way to soft (even in raw). I am not comparing to a DSLR... even an old canon sx100 is sharper (apples to apples, the canon has no raw mode so I don't know what goes into the jpeg processing there).So...Overall this is good point and shoot camera with full manual control, a wide lens (perhaps to wide!) that is very fast at its widest. I have not tried the movie modes or the intelligent auto modes too much, but the in the few instances when used them the results were good. The camera is comfortable to handle (more than the S95 in my opinion) and the controls are intuitive. The ability to shoot at moderately low light or handheld in a wider range of situations afforded by the 2.0 lens is great and I love it. The image quality is not what I expected thought and that bothers me. I must add however, that at standard magnifications this is not a problem but becomes apparent as you look closely. Most problematic is the unattractive, washed out jpegs produced in the standard mode, which do not become much better in \"dynamic\" mode. Shooting raw and some postprocessing takes care of that, but requires work on your part.Do I recommend the camera? I think this is still the camera that best suits my needs (full manual control in a compact body with low light abilities). I like the low light abilities and the wide angle but the IQ still has me scratching my head.

So,the white one is not ugly but the black one in my opinion is more more beautiful.

For me the $500 was pricy to my student-ish budget, but it was really worth it. I'm squeezing every last option out of this little Lumix! Panasonic's official LX5 page does a great job of laying down the specs. The battery life is great on this camera, but if you want to buy extra batteries, they are about $80.This little camera is fun, fast, and the Leica lens makes really sharp, clear pictures. There are many, many options so creativity is not limited either. The design is sleek, and it takes better than average photographs. One reviewer suggested not getting the LX5 if you just want a camera to take party pics but I could not disagree more! Not only does it take fantastic, artistic party pics but it's a great conversation piece. Just don't loose it at the party....this camera is a people pleaser. Take it out to the city, museum, or country and see what you can really do with it!

In short, it's the kind of camera that inspires expanded creativity. I keep coming back to wide-angle lens on the Pin-hole setting. It makes such a great moody pic.The one complaint I have is the size of the body--I have small hands and still, it feels small for me and there is not much of a curve to wrap your palm around. Find the Lumix protective case with shoulder strap for it (I got mine online for $20) and this solves the prob and also protects your little friend for many amazing pics to come.Also, some reviews have complained about how to attach the lens cap--there is a small hole in the side edge.  Loop it through, then loop the attached lens cover to one of the metal strap loops. Voila, solved!Happy Shooting!", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Seriously an amateur!", "Author": "K. Kuguru \"Herostic!\"", "ReviewID": "R2WRWP91W8ZH0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please do not confuse the subject line, as I can not even consider myself a \"serious amateur\", but rather I am seriously an amateur.  At least up until I purchased the LX5.  Prior to that I wasn't even in the market for a camera.  it all started last month when I was over at a friends house and he had all his pictures scrolling in the background on his massive flatscreen TV connected to his Apple TV.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen because it was just beautiful picture after beautiful picture.  When I asked him if these were real photo's or professional stock photo's, he just cooly pulled out his LX3 and I was blown away because I wasn't expecting him to tell me he actually took the pictures himself and and if he did, then for sure he would at least be pulling out a big 'ol SLR.  Like so many others on this review page, he explained that since he got his LX3, his SLR has been gathering dust (trust me I had no idea what an SLR was at the time, but I was just nodding my head pretending to know the acronyms, dumbfounded by the pictures in the background).  So the camera obviously had me at \"hello\" and I was immediately ready to go out and impulsively buy the LX3 that minute, but my bud wisely told me to wait a week or so and get the LX5 since it had a better zoom which was his only complaint with the LX3... and the rest is history.Since that time I can't stop experimenting and snapping away with my new LX5 and the myriad of picture taking options.  I've been reading mad amounts of forums, talking to people who know photography and learning a ton in a very short amount of time.  It was super overwhelming at first because the camera has a bajillion and 1 options, but it wasn't long before I was really feeling the power at my fingertips and I was truly taking amazing shots for myself.  Most of the happy people reviewing this fantastic product are camera buffs looking for an alternative to their SLR's.  But I'm a person who has been converted overnight into a photography fan because of this product and actually can start to consider myself a \"Serious Amateur\" thanks to this wonderful camera which just begs to be experimented with and rewards you instantly with pictures that sometimes makes even my SLR-owning sister jealous. I don't know if I'll ever be able to use a normal P&S; again and I can totally see why people go and drop the big bucks for SLR's and related photography equipment so it definitely serves as the perfect stepping stone should I decide to move on past serious amateur status. So sorry this review contains absolutely no technical specs (because if it did I would just be making it up anyway), just a testimony to what really matters at the end of the day.  A heck of a lot of fun and freakin incredible photo's that make you proud that you shot em!The only downside is the included software bundle. But then again, in general the software that comes bundles with all of these camera and other electronic hardware products tend to be of the just-good-enough variety.  Upon playing with the RAW editing software, I did notice one particular strange case where the included SilkyPix software could not process the RAW file as well as the JPG that was generated by the camera.  Even when I made no changes and then developed the RAW file as is, the pic didn't look as creamy smooth as the original JPG and no edits I made would improve the picture compared to the original jpg.  I found that to be extremely strange and because of that I continue to shoot with both RAW & JPG on just to make sure, otherwise I was tempted to shoot in exclusively RAW because with batch processing /developoing it wouldn't be that big of a deal but definitely not going to do that if the camera is generating better jpg's than the software does with the RAW files... If anybody has any comments or suggestions on this, would love to hear it.  PLEASE SHARE!  In the meantime, I might try out some of the other RAW processing software suggested on this review page like Lightroom 3 and see if that makes a difference.Finally I also took quite a bit of sample video footage just to play around with the various formats of AVCHD Lite vs Motion JPEG.  I discovered that when I shoot in AVCHD-Lite format, I can edit the footage directly with an editing software called Cyberlink PowerDirector.  Beware that it's the only reasonably priced (e.g. under $100) video editing software that seems to be able to handle the AVCHD-Lite format right now.  Other softwares, like Pinnacle Studio do not currently read the AVCHD Lite format and you will be required to first convert to MPEG-2 or something similar.  This would seem like it would be fine because normal DVD's are ultimately recorded in the MPEG-2 format, but there's always by definition quality degradation with every conversion and I did try it for myself and saw that the quality degradation was quite noticeable vs editing directly in AVCHD-Lite format and only converting to HQ DVD format during the final rendering/burning stage (comparison was done using the same vido editing software).  When I finally did burn my first sample DVD, the outcome was deliciously crystal clear video output (played on my Philips DVD player and upscaled to 1080i), which rivaled the clarity of the Blu-Ray disk playing at the Flatscreen TV store.  Seriously, I'm not kidding, my little 5 min video looked like it was a HD Blu-ray disk.  I also tested burnning a AVCHD format disk which can be done on a normal DVD media and playing it on a blu-ray player (standard player will not play AVCHD disks) and the results were similar to the normal HQ Standard DVD (upscaled).  Later I plan to test burning to an actual blu-ray disk (but those disks cost a bundle), but I seriously doubt it will look any more High-Def than what I already saw with the normal DVD after upscaling.  I did however find the quality of the procedure of using the AVCHD-Lite format directly to be significantly noticeably better than shooting in the Motion JPG format, although you may still want to shoot in this format to save space or if you do not have PowerDirector or similar video-editing software that can handle the AVCHD-Lite. Motion JPG works good enough. REITERATE that at this stage most other software packages can NOT handle the AVCHD-Lite format for whatever reason so remember that before you go out and shoot a ton without a plan on how to edit it later.Bottom Line:  Thanks to the LX5 I am happily looking forward to justifying my new self-proclaimed \"serious amateur\" status!  I have a trip coming up for both the Taj Mahal as well as the Great Wall and I'm embarrassed to say that I'm more excited about the pics that I'll end up taking vs actually seeing the great wonders with my bare eyes.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Falling In Love with Photography-- Again", "Author": "Kerry L Daniel", "ReviewID": "R1QCULMTSSYX1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Santa brought me my first camera, a Kodak Brownie, when I was 10 years old.  That gift was a turning point.  It introduced me to a form of personal expression that seduced, amazed and inspired me like no other. In fact, I loved photography so much I set out to make it a life-long career, and darn near did. Then something happened early on, when I was forced for a time to earn my living as a wedding photographer:  I was driven so crazy by bridezillas and their caffeine-addicted mothers that I threw down my camera at the altar and vowed never again to take another picture. Then digital cameras came along about the same time I became a mom to the most photogenic Norwegian Forest cat that ever set paws on this planet, and the photo bug bit me again -- hard. I owned a few digitals, and thought I had one that I could live with forever -- a Canon Powershot S1 IS. I'm not going to badmouth it because it's a sweet camera.  But for whatever reason, I never felt at home with it.  It was bulky, heavier than I wanted it to be, and I could never figure out the menu to get it to do what I wanted in a seamless fashion.  So about a year ago I decided to research my DREAM camera to replace it.I was determined not to be impulsive this time.  So after determining what features I was looking for, and which bells and whistles I could live without, I methodically read reviews here on Amazon.  Because most of my photos were scenics, and people and pet portraits, I knew I didn't really need a mega telephoto lens.  What was important?  Crisp, delicious images; an easy to understand menu, small size, light weight, good battery life, the ability to take great low light pictures, and a full range of options from point and shoot to manual, with some great creativity programming.I researched small cameras for nearly a year, and finally narrowed it down to the Canon S95 and the Panasonic Lumix LX-5.  The final deciding factor, the one thing that led me to choose the LX-5 over the Canon, was how much other owners of the camera absolutely LOVED the camera.  When I read their reviews I felt that same sense of excitement, enthusiasm, and love that I experienced when I held that little Kodak Brownie in my hand for the first time, way back when.I'm not going to repeat all the technical jargon that others have written in their reviews:  the facts are there in other reviews for you to read. But if you're like me, and you have several options to consider, and the technical stuff is pretty equal, it boils down to an emotional decision. I wanted to fall in love. So I chose the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black). I've had my new camera for several weeks now, and let me tell you:  This little baby does not disappoint! She is lovely to hold and behold.From the minute I took it out of the box and held it for the first time, I could feel my heart swell. I did not buy it from Amazon because it was a lot of money for me, and I wanted to choose a vendor that I had past experience with that I didn't see listed among the options.  However, I'm a huge Amazon fan, and I buy a lot of stuff here--including some of the additional gear I've gotten for my camera.  I'm going to make some recommendations, because once you buy the camera you are gonna want to \"dress her up.\" And there's a lot of fun stuff to do that with that is much more than just eye candy.The first thing I did was order a book.  I knew the manufacturer's manual would be inadequate, and it is.)  So I was grateful I went with my gut, and that some thoughtful individual had written a great bookPhotographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5: Getting the Most from Panasonic's Advanced Digital Camera I bought BOTH the Kindle version and the softcover version of Alexander S. White's book. It is invaluable, a MUST READ, in order to get comfortable with this beautiful camera right from the get go. It's worth every penny!The Lumix LX-5 allows for the use of filters, and these inexpensive additions can add some real zing to your pictures.  Most everyone, including me, agrees that if you can only afford one filter to start with, make it a Panasonic DMW-LPL52 52mm Polarizer Filter.  And with that you'll need a conversion lens adapter, Panasonic DMW-LA6 Conversion Lens Adapter. This filter reduces reflections on water and glass, and with it you can pop the clouds right out of the sky for the most dramatic images imaginable.Once I had the camera and took it outside for the first time, I was disappointed that the brilliant LED screen that was so appreciated indoors was useless in bright sunshine.  I had read about the live viewfinder, Panasonic DMW-LVF1 External Live Viewfinder for Panasonic GF1 Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameraand many of the camera's owners said it was overpriced.  It is, but if you are a person like me who takes a lot of outdoor pictures in bright sun, you are going to want this viewfinder. It is fantastic, easy to use, and absolutely essential.  Someone wrote in a review that it fit too loosely...it doesn't.  It's a very snug fit.  And it's extremely well made.I also ordered Vivitar VIV-VT-67 67-Inch Monopodand the Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mount.  I could not believe what a fantastic bargain these two items are, and the exceptional quality.  Haven't gotten the mini-ball head yet, it's due tomorrow, but the monopod is very sturdy and well-made.  At under $10 for the monopod and $12 and change for the mini-ball head on Amazon, you can't go wrong.The last thing I ordered was a wrist strap from Gordy's, [...]  Gordy hand-makes them, in a variety of styles and configurations, all in leather.Next week, I'm headed to Hunting Island State Park in South Carolina for vacation...and a honeymoon with my new camera.  I'll be taking lots of pics and will post some here for you to look at when I get back. I've taken a number of pictures already, and I'm thrilled with the Panasonic Lumix LX-5.  It makes me feel like a kid again.  I want to thank all of you who have posted such thorough reviews here.  They helped me make one of the best decisions of my life.If you are someone sitting on the fence trying to decide between this camera and another, I highly recommend the Panasonic.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "notes from a novice point of view - plus Update: video tip for Mac users", "Author": "Desert Gypsy \"A Brooklyn Girl Out West\"", "ReviewID": "RIPFYXUTZK5Z2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After several weeks of research and having read hundreds of reviews for this and other cameras with similar capabilities I will cut to the chase and say I don't have a single regret in purchasing this camera. In fact, this is hands down my most favorite *thing* to own in many years....First off, if you are a true novice like me, may I suggest ordering Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5: Getting the Most from Panasonic's Advanced Digital Camera - the PDF version is less than ten bucks - worth every penny.Other accessories I ordered: these are things I think are needed or *very* nice to have straight out of the box -Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10EGGS Optical Glass DSLR LCD Screen Protector for Panasonic Lumix DMC LX5 / LX3 and Leica D-LUX4Olympus  Adjustable Wrist Strap for all Olympus compact cameras (Black)Case Logic Medium Camera and Flash Camcorder Casenow, my review -Why I chose *this* camera:About twenty years ago I took a photography class in college and learned the basics of using an SLR; for a couple of years thereafter I took some pretty nice pictures but as I started a family I found it was easier to use cheap point and shoot cameras to keep up with the kids. It shows in the albums over the years when this changeover occurred.... a \"cheapening\" of the images. Now that the pace of my life has slowed down considerably, I have the time to relearn the techniques that produced better photos but I still think sometimes the ease and speed of a point and shoot is still a good backup plan to ensure that you don't miss the moment entirely.While scouring reviews for this and other options, one thing struck me as unusual about this particular camera; while there are lots of cameras with lots of five star reviews regarding technically spectacular features, the LX5 most often inspires the word LOVE. Not only does it have the features that serve both newbies and professional photographers alike, more often than not *both* will state that they LOVE this camera. It's one thing to be \"satisfied\", another to be \"impressed\", but \"love\" speaks to a whole other level of appreciation.Why I *love* this camera:I think I have a good eye; I figure with the many features of this camera if I *do* have talent, this camera will help bring it out. I like that while I am learning I can rely on the IA mode to take great shots for me. Since many of the professionals reviewing this camera have laid down their DSLRs in favor of this model I think there's little chance that my new skills will outgrow the many manual features and functions.What has impressed me the most so far:I have yet to have the flash go off indoors in situations that would normally create \"brown-outs\" for my old camera, meaning everything would have this subtle sepia tone if I didn't use a flash or appear washed out when using the flash. The low light capability is EXCELLENT with the LX5! Also, the test shots I've done have picked up some amazingly fine detail; apparently my house is much dustier than I thought :)What I am most looking forward to:I would like to fully explore the video capabilities of this camera. So far I think that's going to be the biggest challenge because not only do I have so much to learn with what I want to accomplish with photos, but I am using a Mac laptop with an older operating system (Leopard) which apparently SilkyPix does NOT want to play nice with. We'll just have to see....I'll update this review as I learn more about the camera but oh-so-enjoying the honeymoon stage!_________________________Update 01/26/12: While trying to learn to shoot video on the LX5 I had been using a EyeFi wireless memory card to transfer the files to my Macbook Air. Handbrake could reformat the files for me but it was a hassle and took *forever*. So I switched to a regular SanDisk card and did a little more research.Reading further into the A. White book about this camera, I followed the author's instructions to set the video options to JPEG and was surprised to find that the video loaded onto my MBA into iPhoto in MOV format without a hitch!

But after doing a bit of research, I found out that the Lumix DMC-LX5 was on par, if not a little better than the S95. After taking many still pictures and videos (and processing them), I can honestly say that Panasonic has made a winner with this camera.Still ImagesThe photos I've taken in bright light all look crisp and vibrant which isn't a surprise. In low light, the LX5 also perfoms well - especially considering it's not an SLR. I take a lot of indoor pictures with the flash off. And the results are pretty good at reproducing the exact scene I took - despite the lack of perfect bright light. Still, if you get into a situation where you need the manual controls, this camera has that covered.VideosVideos look great because it records in 720p HD AVCHD format by default. The HD quality is excellent, with smooth focusing, and crisp images. (Other point and shoot cameras often have shifty focusing where the focus jumps depending on what is in the frame at the time.) What's more, in video mode, you have access to almost all the manual controls you have in still image mode - most other cameras in this price range are not as flexible.ControlsManual controls is one this camera's strengths. Aperture, exposure, ISO, flash, aspect ratio, auto focus, manual focus, scene setting, macro settings, and everything inbetween can be adjusted manually with this camera.  Want to keep it on auto focus? No problem - it does that very well too. Most of my own pictures are taken with autofocus on. But sometimes I like to take over and have the aperture set manually (aperture priority), in which case the camera auto-adjusts everything else. When I like to get artistic, I set the camera to full manual and adjust everything myself.Photo and Video processing and conversionOne thing most people don't talk about is processing the photos and the videos from this camera on your computer. I use a Windows 7 64bit PC that lacks an SD card reader. Fortunately, I could connect the camera directly to my PC via the included USB cable. Then by using the PhotoFunStudio software provided by Panasonic (on CD-ROM) I transferred all the photos and videos I took to my PC's hard drive.  By default, the LX5 saves its videos in AVCHD format which is not supported by many video players. But, you can convert these videos to MPEG2 in the provided software easily (which is then supported by many players). The MPEG2 videos look just as sharp and vibrant as the AVCHD videos they originated from. Alternatively, you can also set the camera to shoot in Motion Jpeg format (Quicktime compatible), which is immediately useable by Youtube.SD CardI chose to use a 16gb PNY Class 10 SDHC SD card. It writes very fast and getting the videos off the card is quick as well. I have no complaints about this SD card. In video mode the 16gb of memory gives me approximately 2hours of video on default settings. (This can be adjusted to extend the time at the cost of video quality.)GRIPES:No camera is perfect, and the LX5 isn't either. Compared to the Canon S95 (which shares the same price point and similiar features), it isn't nearly as portable. The huge Leica lense sticks out of the body just enough to keep it from being easily-pocketed in a pair of jeans. The LX5 uses a traditional lense cap which I will probably loose one day when I get careless. And although that 3inch LCD screen is beautiful, it still is hard to see in direct sunlight. I wish Panasonic included a viewfinder with this camera. Sure, I can get an attachment, but for $400, I expect it to come with the camera.CONCLUSION:If you're in the market for a great point-and-shoot camera that has all the manual controls you can use; and it does video really well - check out the LX5 it's one of the best.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "better in low light", "Author": "William Jungels", "ReviewID": "R1SSLX0P0P4YNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned every model in this series. I read with interest the Imaging Resource and DPReview assessments of this new model. What finally convinced me to upgrade to the LX5 from the LX3 was comparing photos that I made of the same subject shot at ISO 400 on the two cameras. At high magnification the dark areas on the LX3 image were blotchy while on the LX5 they were much cleaner. Since then I have found that photos shot at ISO 800 on the LX5 appear as good to me as photos shot at ISO 400 on the LX3. I do a lot of documentary photography in low light which I incorporate into video documentaries and also print large blow ups for exhibit .  I need to travel light and not intimidate people with large cameras. This one stop advantage in a small camera is important to me. Also, I work close to people so I don't need a lot of zoom, but the LX series super wide lens is very useful to me. I've heard that the LX5 has less barrel distortion than the LX3 (which has considerable), but I haven't tried to confirm this yetThere is only one thing that frustrates me about the new model. Focusing with the Manual Focus Assist was fairly swift and painless with the LX3's mini joystick toggle. With the LX5's thumb dial it is both slow and cumbersome, although the dial serves well for other functions like adjusting aperture. It is too stiff for focusing (the opposite of the Canon S90s function dial which is so loose that you are forever changing settings without meaning to).The menu control configuration and the quick menu on the LX5 are improvements that speed up other adjustments.

Something that was light in weight, took good pictures and preferably could save the photos in RAW format. The ZS1 was a very nice camera for hiking because it was small, light, could zoom 12x but it was not good for low light because it had a slow lens starting at f3.3 and could only save the photos in JPEG format.I've been looking at the LX5 for quite a while but was a reluctant to buy one because several of the camera review sites mentioned that it was close to the size and weight of the Panasonic GF1 which I already have. They also questioned what marketing niche the LX5 could possibly fill. When you compare the specs it does look like they are closely similar especially when the GF1 uses the 20mm pancake lens. Since I consider the GF1 to be too heavy to carry during hikes even with the small pancake lens, I was on the fence about buying the LX5 especially if it was considered to be so similar. But when I lost the ZS1 I took the plunge.WRONG! The LX5 is a much LIGHTER and SMALLER camera than the GF1! I'm really disappointed at these camera review sites for giving such a false impression of the LX5. And it is more versatile than the GF1 with fixed focal length 20mm lens because of the 3.8X zoom. If you use the normal 14-45mm zoom lens on the GF1 it's even less of a contest - the size and weight goes up dramatically.So the LX5 will make a great replacement for the ZS1 I lost, though not as compact or light in weight and doesn't zoom 12X. But it does have a bigger sensor and although it takes similar 10mp photos, the pictures from the LX5 should turn out better especially when I can save the photos in the RAW format. You can also save the photos simultaneously in RAW and JPEG. I also won't have to worry about low-light conditions because of the fast f2 lens.I can also use the DMW-LVF1 external clip on viewfinder which is a huge plus because I had a difficult time seeing and composing the image on the ZS1 lcd in bright sunlight.So if you were hesitant about buying the LX5 because you read that it was similar in size to the GF1 try both out at a camera store. I guess the GF1 is now replaced by the slightly smaller GF2 but I would think you'd still find the LX5 to be a smaller, lighter camera, enough to make a difference especially when you have to carry it around all day.I also looked at the Canon S95-S90. Although much smaller and lighter than the LX5, the photos I've seen taken with the S95 had a lot of blown out highlights. It also has a short battery life (I don't want to have to carry an extra battery), only 28mm wide angle opposed to 24mm on the LX5 and more complaints of problems than Panasonic. I also have several other Panasonic cameras and have not had any problems with them so it was a no-brainer.I would give it a 4.5 rating if I could.ADDENDUM:It's the thiness of the LX5's body compared to the GF1 that makes all the difference in how the camera feels. Also the weight difference is only a few ounces but the LX5 seems much lighter.I've used it on several hikes now and I can say that the images are very sharp but there's a slight distortion when in wide angle mode. The people or trees at either ends of the photos appear bowed in. Also the focusing is not instantaneous. It takes what seems like about a second to acquire focus - it probably only seems that long and is faster in actuality but when hiking in a group it's enough to slow down the person behind you which is annoying for them. The ZS1 was as slow or slower than the LX5 so I shouldn't complain too much. I try to get around the slow focus by hiking in the rear where I'm not impeding others except for the sweep or I've volunteered to be the sweep a couple of times so I have the luxury of taking my time in composing the picture. Also pre-zooming or pre-focusing helps if you can do it on the move.I thought I would miss the 12x zoom of the ZS1 but the LX5's 3.8x zoom seems to be adequate and I haven't missed the 12x zoom of the ZS1.The battery lasts a long time. I took over 400 pictures on a hike using the JPEG + RAW mode and still had lots of power left - still on the second bar. I used up a 4gb card and almost all of my 2gb backup card.It's a very good camera and I would still give it a 4.5 rating.As an aside, I bought a much larger case than I normally would because of the protruding lens but the larger case turned out to be a good thing because I can easily stick my hand in the bag and dig out the camera much faster than I normally could with a tight fitting case and because it has a top opening I can just leave it open and the camera will still be secure. It's a Case Logic. I bought it at Wal Mart. Sorry I don't know the model. I checked on Amazon but they don't seem to have the case I bought. At first the case swung about a lot when using the neck strap which was annoying but I trapped the case straps under the backpack chest strap and problem solved.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb Camera!", "Author": "jim5454", "ReviewID": "RK9FQ9WVWIK32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my son for Christmas.

Wang", "ReviewID": "R16U9UU1ATLBLL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic LX5 continues its tradition in form and function in its lineup. I skipped the LX3 but have used LX2 since its introduction all the way until I replaced it with the LX5. Certainly there is no comparison between the two but since many reviews covered the comparison between the LX3 and LX5, I thought I would provide a bit of different perspective.These pro-compact cameras have the best overall design that offers the widest range of application, versatility, and user-friendliness. The LX5 feels just perfect in one-hand control as much as two-hand operations. Its size and weight is also very thoughtfully engineered that makes traveling or shooting on the go a breeze. I have not felt the same way trying out the Canon S and G series, as one is too small and the latter too big for me.Interestingly, while almost every review I read calls LX series' lens cap a drawback, and that Panasonic didn't improve on this \"problem\", I see it differently. First, the new cap on the LX5 has inner latching design instead of outer clamp design on the LX2. This means the cap size is reduced and looks more streamlined. There is also the addition of a beautiful attractive silver bezel around the edge to highlight its valuable and classy look. I would call those a huge improvement over the look and function of the LX2's lens cap. Regarding convenience, my mentality is that I believe I am using a mini-SLR at all time with these LXs, it's only suitable that a serious camera be fitted with a serious looking lens cap. ;) The way I see it, this retro-inspired rangefinder style camera will lose its appeal if equipped with automatic lens shutters.The picture quality are certainly outstanding. However, it is very important for the photographer to know all the quirks this type of camera comes with (and there are quite many). Yes, the LX5 is capable of producing full SLR-like pictures but only if you understand how to use it and maximize its full potential. The user needs to really get to know all the settings and compensations during his shoot to be able to always get shots that one could have obtained much faster using an SLR. Basically, the LX5 is not always consistent at producing extraordinary pictures unless cares are taken during use.One minor complaint I have is the battery case that came with the camera is now virtually garbage. It does not fully enclose the entire battery but only the contact points and side walls. I also miss the leather wrist strap that came with my LX2.Overall the LX5 is an excellent product and leaves little to be desired or improved upon. I would however not recommend or hand this camera to family members or friends that are not knowledgeable about photography and photographic equipments in general. For that they have plenty of choices on the market and is hard to go wrong with the major brands these days.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sharp, wide, quick, great!", "Author": "Design49er", "ReviewID": "R2MIJ2L6A8DJVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For how I like to, and what I like to shoot, I have not had a better camera than the LX5.The Leitz lens is super sharp...\"it's all about the lens\" is the old saying in film terms.  My old standard were Nikon lenses I loved shooting with, the 24mm f/2.8, 55mm f/3.5 macro and the 105mm f/2.8 short telephoto were iconic lenses known for their sharpness.  I shot a few times with a film Leica M5 and that was super sharp too, like the LX5.The 24mm (35mm equivalent) is my view of life - I used to live with the Nikon 24 f/2.8 on my FM - the Panasonic camera and Leica lens is at least a sharp if not more so, with less distortion.  No more fat arms or pulled cheeks at the edges, everything looks pretty normal given it's a super wide.  I can hold the camera at arms length and take good two-shots of my wife and me in a dim elevator or dark restaurant without a glare-y harsh flash.  Magical.The 2.0 maximum f-stop is great for these two-shots.  In the underwater room at the California Academy of Sciences the other day, I did the two shot of us at 24mm @ f/2.0 @ 1/30th at a pretty low ISO so the shot had no digital noise at all but captured the weird color cast of being several feet underwater which wouldn't have happened with a flash - beautiful!  All while holding the camera at arm's length because of the wide angle could get my wife and I with fish above, perfect (no more asking strangers to take our pic!).The camera's light weight and small size fit my hands just right.  I'm getting older and now nearly at retirement cannot put up with the bulk of an SLR anymore.  At the same time, with my eyesight going and getting some arthritis is my finger joints, I no longer am fond of the ultra-tiny digital point and shoots with their equally tiny controls that I'm constantly hitting by mistake.  The LX5 is a good compromise for me, mostly mechanical buttons and switches clearly marked so I can operate them without glasses - my last two Panasonic point and shoots were more pocketable but this led to casual handling and subsequent droppage and cracked LCDs.

I can tell you that after reading the reviews from the LX3, I decided this was the camera I wanted.I have never been much of a photo taker, and I wanted to change that.  So I compiled a list of wants.- Small, compact design.  I didn't want to be the guy with the SLR format camera up in everyone's face at parties just so I could take good pictures.  I knew those things intimidated me when I saw friends whip 'em out so I wanted a small camera that invoked a more casual response from people.- A Teacher camera.  I wanted something that not only took great pictures naturally, but one that allowed for a great depth of manipulation on the manual side for someone who knew what they were doing.  Basically, I wanted a camera that I could grow with.- Amazing photos.  My friends are all very jealous of this camera, especially my learned photography friends.  They use Canon, Pentax, Nikon not to mention a wide variety of film cameras I don't know the name of.  They are all blown away with the ease that I am able to take impressive photos.Bottom Line.  It fits in my pocket (although very tight), I'm learning more about the technical side of photography all the time, and in the mean time I'm capturing amazing pictures with relatively no adjustments.Also, the video is AMAZING!  The first video I captured was an injured yellow jacket walking in the grass.  With the macro focus I got so close that you could see the hex patterns in its eyes.  My brother said it looked like something out of Planet Earth.My complaints are things I already knew before purchasing.- Weak zoom, but that's the trade off I was okay with in order to have a compact camera.- No Vari-angle LCD.  Canon has one on the G12, but after side by side testing with my friend's G12 we both agreed the LX5 takes far superior shots.OH and it's 100 dollars cheaper now than when I bought it.

What is great about it is the quality of the end product.  i have taken pictures and printed them up to ll x 14 with results as good as I have gotten with my Canon 2dx.  I am sure that i could get great results at 16 x 20 - at least that is the appearance on the monitor.  Now there are however some drawbacks - one is the size.  If you are looking for a pocket camera this isn't it. Still I have found that this isn't that large or cumberson.  Another drawback is that lens cover.  Couldn't they have put a cover over the lens like the small cameras do?  But that is minor. Of course there is the lag time - still I find that it is short enough to catch most pictures that I want.  I find this to be a great substitute for lugging around the big 2dx or any other SLR.  For years I was a wedding photographer with a studio.  Upon retiring (a decade ago) I wanted to stop carrying around all of the necessary equipment needed to get quality prints.  For years I shlepped around with the Nikons, Hasselblads and then the pockets.  Always it would be the same - convenient camera but low quality prints.  Then I would give the cameras to my adult kids - they loved the convenience.  At last, after several years and half a dozen cameras later I discovered this camera and I am more than pleased.  It turns out quality prints with only a few adjustments and because of some of its fine features allows me to get pictures where I ordinarily would not try - low light and available light situations.

Bottom line: no it is not equal, but if you are interested in ease, handy size, and perfectly good results in the digital age (for a whole lot less money) it compares very well.I want high quality, but I shoot for content. For me, an eye-level viewfinder is a big factor for getting that photographic moment. Some reviews have criticized this, and the Leica D-lux 5 viewfinders because the image quality is noticeably lower, compared to the 3\" screen. True, the image is softer. That may be a result of a fast refresh (it's much quicker than digital viewfinders I've seen in the past) and to keep the unit relatively small. Compare it to the viewfinders in M-series 35mm cameras that were the photojournalist's standard. They were sharp, because they were direct views through Leica glass. They had 3 lens frames, achieved simply by cropping the full view, but not enlarging it. (And remember, you had to carry the three lenses, and, sometimes, two or three bodies) This digital viewfinder gives the actual view, no matter what the zoom. The visual quality may be better in the future, but for now this zooming viewfinder makes up for a Whole Lot!The camera itself is a little miracle, as are many digital cameras. (Trusted testers say it is at the top of the list.) It's simple and flexible. 10MP seems fine, and probably better than some \"bigger\" cameras. My main use is for photos printed relatively small, with extremely high quality offset printing, at a minimum of 400dpi.I've used Canon digital cameras for years. I own a Canon SLR. I did not buy the Leica D-lux 5 for a few reasons. I use PhotoShop, so I don't need the better software. If I had bought the Leica, I would have put a piece of tape over the coveted red dot, simply because it is coveted and I don't want to carry a target for theft. I do the same on my 35mm Leicas.

I spent several weeks evaluating different brands and models via internet reviews and mfgs. websites. I didn't have the luxury of putting my hands on any units prior to making my decision and as every review website had both positive as well as negative comments. After reading hundreds of reviews a few common threads emerged.1. Some people said the imaging was poor with JPEGS 2. Some people commented negatively on the overall quality of the video. I was somewhat nervous about selecting a unit where people were unimpressed wtih its imaging, however every mfg. had similar comments. I finally found a couple websites that allowed the reviewer to define the type of use they put the camera through (ie. hobby, semi-pro, professional etc.) and so I focused on reviews from those who listed themselves as professionals to sort out all the comments from left field, as the pro comments were written about what was really important to me, image quality and when the smoke cleared, I decided that not only was the imaging apparently pretty darn strong, this unit provided more of the controls that you get with a DSLR including RAW imaging which is important to me as one thing I learned with my DSLR is that if you want to have any control over your image in a post processing environment, being able to shoot RAW images and have manual control over many of the settings for overall image quality and the ability to take bracketed exposure images etc. is a must.I got this camera about 4 hours before an important going away party for a friend of mine who was leaving for Honduras to live and took the camera with a freshly charged battery to the event and shot both videos and stills with factory defaults in the program mode as I had no time to learn any of the more indepth features of the camera.

I recommend buying an inexpensive wrist strap for it, like the Nikon AN-CP19 Replacement Strap.Also, the GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector for Leica D-lux 4 and Panasonic Lx-3 Digital Cameras shows up as \"frequently bought together\" with the LX-5, but it doesn't quite fit.  It's not quite wide enough, and a little too high. You can put it on if you remove the hot shoe cover (then put the hot shoe cover back on over it), but it blocks that little connection socket on the back of the camera, below the hot shoe.

The auto-focus of my camcorder was not working as well as I  had hoped and I was a bit too close to the camera that compounded the problem. Furthermore, somewhere along the way, the movie conversion process resulted in a very poor quality video... I'm disappointed in it and I hope it doesn't drive you crazy.The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 is the camera I have been waiting for. It is a compact, metal body camera with a very fast, high quality Leica lens with a f2.0 aperture. This gives you fantastic low-light performance particularly in conjunction with the high ISO that the camera has. And the recent firmware upgrade, v2.0, adds high ISO noise reduction when ISO is set to 1600 or 3200 thereby increasing the usability of high ISO. It's nice to know that in situations where the only chance to get any sort of shot at all is by using high ISO, that at least you can get something, rather than nothing.I'm impressed that Panasonic has already released a firmware upgrade (v2.0) for the LX5. You can determine what firmware version you have by going to the menu, navigating to the Setup menu, then moving to page 7 of the Setup menu where you will see \"Version Disp.\" A further right click of the 5-way controller takes you to the screen which shows you the firmware version. Here is what was addressed in the v2.0 firmware upgrade...-Miniature Effect has been added to My Color Mode-The upper limit of the shutter speed in Manual Exposure Mode has been raised to 250 seconds. You now have shutter speeds of 80, 100, 125, 160, 200 and 250 seconds in manual exposure mode thus greatly increasing the ability to use the camera for night photography.-Monitor/Viewfinder has been added to the Setup menu. This gives you the ability to adjust the brightness, color or red or blue tint of the LCD monitor or optional external live viewfinder.-High ISN Noise Reduction has been added to the Rec menu.-Active Mode has been added to the Motion Picture menu. This adds electronic image stabilization (in addition to the optical image stabilizer) to further decrease jitter when recording movies handheld. Probably not a good idea to use this when camera is on a tripod in most cases-The position and size of the AF area you set is now stored.-The AF/AE lock operated by half-pressing the shutter button has been improved.-When MF is set, you can mamke fine adjustments to the focus using a simpler operation than before.You can only wonder whether a future firmware upgrade might bring even more exciting features to the LX5. But even if there is no further upgrade, v2.0 adds and/or significantly improves the operation of the camera and gives added functionality.The LX5 has a gorgeous metal body. Of course this means that you'll eventually accumulate some dings if you're not careful. But I'll take a ding any day over a crack which is usually what happens to plastic. The metal body gives  the camera a feeling of quality. The rotary mode dial on top of the camera operates easily and smoothly. The zoom lever is placed well and easily operated with your forefinger. The on/off control is a real slider, not a push button and I like that. A handy feature is that you are able to push the \"playback\" button and while holding it, slide the power switch on. The camera will power up and let you view photos without extending the lens. This is really handy. If you want to then take a photo, simply press the shutter button and the lens will extend and you're ready to start shooting. You must always remember to take off the lens cap before the lens will extend. If you don't the camera will display an error message on the LCD screen reminding you to remove the lens cover then to press any button.Also on top of the camera is a one-touch button to begin and end movie recording. That is a very handy function to have. On the other side of the top is the sliding button to raise the flash... it does not pop up automatically. Finally, there is a hot shoe to enable the use of the optional electronic  view finder or an optional flash unit. I've successfully used my Nikon SB800 flash on the LX5. It's kind of large and makes the camera very top-heavy, but when used in conjunction with a tripod, it's great to be able to attach the external flash.The right side of the camera (from the back side point of view) is where you'll find a small cover that when opened gives access to the HDMI and AV/digital ports. No HDMI cable is included however, a minor inconvenience, only a USB and AV cable are included.The back side of the camera has a beautiful 3\" LCD display underneath a slightly larger plastic screen (or it might be glass, it's hard to tell for sure) Be warned that there are some LCD screen protectors for sale that claim to be for the LX5, but in fact are 3\" protectors that do not completely cover the entire screen. Using one of those would leave a certain part of your screen unprotected and also create a ridge that would certainly be a nuisance.The bottom of the camera has a metal threaded tripod mount and a spring-loaded access door for the battery/SD card slot. The door is operated by a sliding lever and next to that lever is a DC coupler cover that when removed enables you to use an optional Panasonic AC adaptor/coupler.The front of the camera features a couple of controls, notably the Aspect Ratio switch and the Focus Selector Switch. At the front of the lens is a removable lens ring to enable the use of optional lens filters. Unextended, the lens protrudes about 5/8\" from the body (without lens cap) and fully extended is about 1.5 inches.The camera, although quite compact, still feels pretty good in-hand. The rubberized grip area in front gives you a secure feeling and the camera is quite light in weight. The Leica lens is excellent and I am continually amazed by the photos this camera is capable of taking. As others have noted, jpg performance could be better but when shooting in RAW, it's awesome.The provided software is nothing to write home about. SilkyPix is not all that intuitive to use. I'm a Mac user and have not yet upgraded my version of Adobe Lightroom to the latest version. I am however able to use iPhoto to adjust my RAW photos.  I'm not a huge fan of AVCHD format simply because on a Mac, it's not that easy to work with but you actually can import into iMovie AVCHD movies directly from the camera quite easily. I'm not sure why, but you cannot use the File menu to open an AVCHD movie that might be in the Finder in iMovie, it must be imported. Another tip for Mac users is that the Handbrake application can easily open AVCHD and then save in MP4 format using  MPEG-4 or H.264 codec.There are just a few things to be aware of with the LX5. Since it uses a CCD sensor, it is prone to creating obnoxious streaking bands in bright light situations, either outside with sun or inside with bright lights. You need to compose your shots more carefully in those situations to avoid the streaking band characteristic of CCD sensors. This is not a fault of the camera, it is what it is. The file size of movies is huge. I always end up making them smaller with QuickTime 7 or in iMovie. It can take quite a while to do this depending on the speed of your computer and graphics card.For the first time I am now able to take a small camera with me when I don't want to lug around my D300 and not feel like I made a bonehead choice not to bring a \"good\" camera. The LX5 can produce stunning shots once you learn the ropes with this wonderful, pint-sized camera. The various shooting modes, which I usually avoid in these small point and shoot cameras, actually work well in this camera. I am particularly fond of the Miniature mode and have taken some great shots using that mode.I can't think of many negatives for this camera. If you require a mega-zoom, then obviously this will not be a good choice for you since the LX5 only has a 3.8x zoom. If you enjoy macro photography, you'll love the LX5. It's enables you to get as close as 1/2\" to your subject and with that f2.0 lens you get amazingly shallow depth of field. It is somewhat of a disadvantage to have a proprietary battery that is pricey. But it does enable the camera to be smaller than would otherwise be possible if AA batteries were used. I also do not particularly like how Panasonic implemented the Panorama feature. It doesn't actually stitch the photos together in-camera, but simply gives you a transparent overlay of the prior shot to assist you in lining up your next shot. It works, but not quite as elegantly as it could. You still need to use stitching software to produce a panorama photo.Overall this camera packs a lot of useable features into a compact body. The result is that you have big camera performance in a very small package. I'm continually amazed by the quality of photos that the camera produces, particularly in RAW mode.  It's fantastic that you can use the zoom while making movies, but you may notice some zoom noise in those movies. That's usually the case in most small cameras and camcorders that allow you to zoom.  I was lucky enough to get this camera earlier in December when it was featured as a Gold Box deal of the day. Wow, what a bargain. But even at the standard price I feel this camera offers a lot of bang for the buck. It's a great size which makes it easy to carry with you. Great quality, lots of useable features, fast lens, what's not to like?UPDATE: 12-16-2011 - I've just installed and reviewed the GGS Optical Glass DSLR LCD Screen Protector for Panasonic Lumix DMC LX5 / LX3 and Leica D-LUX4 and think it is a must have option to protect the display of the LX5 from scratches and help prevent damage to the display. You might also want to check out a case to protect this camera.

Even with a mono mic, the audio quality is very good.- Image quality (with RAW) is at least on par with Canon S95. ISO800 is very usable with PP. Btw the RAW converter software is included and has tons of advance features too.- Great battery life- very good image stabilizer (IMO gives 4 stop advatage)- Good hand grip while the camera itself is not too bulky and easily fits in coat pockets.- Camera is quick: start-up, AF times, shutter times, write times (incl RAW) .. all best in class- hot shoe for all those other possiblities (flash, remote flash, EVF/OVF)Lowlights:- Though JPEG processing has adjustable settings, it's still too much processing and isn't the best in terms of NR, color accuracy and WB.- Some important feature settings are buried in the menu. Hoping a firmware upgrade will fix this.- No matching flash with bounce/swivel feature exist yet that isnt' too big and heavy.My bottom line advice is your personal priorities will determine which camera fits you best but please still consider the whole package: size, weight, ergonomics, menu system, AF lag times, RAW write times, battery life, possible accessories, etcBelieve you me these less popular factor can make a huge difference for you.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera: efficient and enjoyable", "Author": "Sameh Abdulrhim", "ReviewID": "R19SIR35HBPL9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the LX5 for almost a year now from Vann's at amazon.com and have used it in different occasions. I will try making some chronological order of my experience with the camera.**First, why I chose the LX5:- I was looking for a small camera to take great photos in most of the situations plus having good video capabilities. I searched in the market and ended, as many, choosing between LX5 and canon S95.- Although I liked the pocket ability of the S95, I chose the LX5 because of the excellent build quality, wide angle bright Leica lens and the optical zoom & AF while shooting video. In addition, one friend who is a professional photographer recommended it on the basis of his experience with the LX3 and the presence of the hot shoe for external flash.- I thought for a while of the micro 4/3 (lumix GF1 & Olympus e-pl1) cameras, but I didn't like the lens size mainly, the price, and because I was waiting to replace my sold Nikon D40 by either D3100 or D5100 to be my big camera.**Second, after start using the LX5:- At the beginning I used the camera in Auto mode but didn't like the color tone especially the sometimes pale colors. Not that it is bad but not what I want. The auto \"happy\" setting was better. Gradually, I was satisfied by using the P mode in most situations and the My color mode (for the indoor shots). I also tried night photography with a tripod the got excellent results. I also tried the RAW shooting with minor postprocessing; namely WB adjustment, brightness and contrast. The results were really amazing.- The video was very good in most situations with very clear picture except in low light videos and when there are strong light spots when purple longitudinal streaks characteristics of CCD sensors appear. Actually, they didn't annoy me much.- As I am not a pro and like to learn more, I find it is interesting to take the camera in a waist belt-attached case and try shots I read about. I really learnt more applications for different shutter speeds and apertures which I wanted to apply on my D40 but couldn't carry it everywhere. For the LX5, mostly I could.- I found the LX5 has almost all the capabilities and customizations which reviewers used to tell that entry level and prosumer DSLRs  are lacking. I can call it \"pro DSLR simulator\". For example, LX5 has dedicated ISO button, Fn button and Quick menu button (this approaches all major adjustments rapidly like WB, multiframe, metering, AF mode....etc) to make rapid adjustments without going deeply into the menus. In addition, there are 4 custom settings to save. To know how nice this is, Ken Rockwell appreciates Nikon D7000 of having 2 custom settings (U1 and U2) and wished it has more. Here LX5 has 4 settings (C1, C2-1, C2-2 and C2-3). when you go to different place, you can just move to a custom setting if you think has exposure characteristics similar to one of the custom settings you saved before without the need to adjust from the start.**What I disliked about the LX5 are:- The slightly more size than I wished in a pocket camera.- The relatively pale color tone in iA mode especially in dim light or shadow. I recommend using the P mode. It is much much better and easy.- Some tendency towards blue hue on white or grey colors in some lighting conditions. This can be overcome by using the My color mode.- Sometimes I feel Auto WB is not perfect with the flash (I mean fine but not perfect). update: this is also better in P mode than in iA mode. and it is better to modify the flash compensation a little according to the distance (add + when farther away and add - if too close to the object). This makes better balanced light but of course if you are in a hurry, leave the flash compensation to the middle (0).- The narrowest aperture is f8. But I feel all P&S; with wide angle lens can't go more.**Final word:When looking to the pros against the cons, I really enjoyed using the LX5 and gained more  knowledge about photography by carrying  a semi-DSLR (in capabilities and customization but not in size) camera for longer time. I highly recommend it to enthusiasts and people who want to gain experience and plan to upgrade in photography.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Compact Camera 5 Star", "Author": "Lawrence B. Jones", "ReviewID": "R29VBN5EBQRAHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I reveiwed the other high end compact cameras and chose the Lumix LX-5 due to Leica involvement. After several hundred photos the choice was correct. From very close macro to landscapes the quality of images rival that of DSLR's costing much more. The Leica lens is razor sharp, with excellent depth of field across relatively long distances between focused subjects. Image stabilizer allows sharp handheld photos with 1/5 second or longer exposures. f-2.0 lens yields excellent color and contrast. The 24 to 90mm zoom range is very practical and the macro focusing switch offers true macro capability through the zoom range. I shoot nature photos for exhibit and sale and the LX-5 has taken my work to a new level without toting a heavy load of bulky equipment. Battery life allows hundreds of photos before recharging.The Silkypix software included allows shooting exceptional RAW photos which can be processed into high quality jpegs and tif files. Highly cropped 68.5x11\" prints of tiny flowers show every detail.I have been a photographer (anateur and pro) for roughly sixty years and the LX-5 is not a disapointment -- it matches my pro film equipment.

I haven't done a side-by-side comparison between the two cameras but based on my first test run the LX5 with the larger sensor, f/2 lens and image stabilization gives me better photos in low-light environments, both for still photos and videos.My main concern about the camera before I bought it was that it might not be pocket-friendly due to the size, and I couldn't find a local store that carried them to check one out.  But based on some of the reviews here (plus a great YouTube video, posted by KrzysztofBasel, on the size), I decided to take a chance and ordered one from Amazon.com.  Admittedly the LX5 is not as small as some cameras, but the LX5 slides easily into and out of my trouser side pockets (regular casual adult trousers), although there is a slight protrusion.  Maybe with jeans it might be a problem.My reasons for buying this camera are as follows; I wanted a pocket-friendly camera to use as my main camera (not just a second camera) with good low-light capability, a wide angle lens and the auto focus and optical zoom in the HD video mode,  The LX5 with the large sensor (large for a pocket-friendly camera), the fast f/2 lens (at the wide angle setting), and the excellent image stabilization meets my requirements.  The Canon S95 was a close second for me, but I wanted some camera features that the S95 didn't have, like the auto focus and optical zoom in the video mode and the 24 mm (equivalent) wide angle lens.As far as the great features and image quality of the LX5, other reviewers here at Amazon.com have done a better job of describing them than I can.

After literally months of research I finally settled on the Lumix DMC-LX5, and after about a month of use I have absolutely no regrets. This camera can take some stellar shots.I've found that this camera performs best in manual mode. One dial controls both the aperture and the shutter speed. The ISO can be adjusted quickly with your right thumb. Manual mode is a joy to use, and the pictures this camera produces when you take control are breathtaking. You can even focus the lens manually, but I haven't found using manual focus necessary because I've found that the camera focuses quickly and accurately. I've also been very pleased with its performance in low-light conditions and with a flash.However, I must give a word of caution. This camera probably is not for everyone. I think the \"intelligent auto\" mode (the point-and-shoot mode) is absolutely worthless on this camera. When using point-and-shoot mode, you get crummy point-and-shoot pictures just like any low-end compact camera. If you want great pictures with this camera, the manual setting is the way to go. The good news is that manual is so easy to use.I don't know if it's just because this camera is new, but at the moment I find it to be a lot more fun to use than the DSLR.

The main contenders in this arena at least for me were the Nikon P7000, Canon S95 and the Olympus XZ1. In the end I chose the Panasonic LX5 and here is why.I. Higher MP's in 16:9 and 3:2.  The XZ1 & S95 are 7.47MP and 7.5MP in 16:9. It gets only slightly better with the 3:2 aspect which is what FX and 35mm cameras shoot in. In 3:2 the XZ1 and S95 are at 8.8 MP. The LX5 shots 16:9 at 8.85MP and 3:2 at 9.5MP. I mostly shoot in those two formats so that made the LX5 really stand out. I'd rather have an extra 1.3MP in 16:9 than the XZ1  that admittedly is more stylish and a touch sharper (or so they say).II. For those of us that like to take long exposures of some exotic capital city, the LX5, XZ1 and Nikon P7000 all stay open for up to 60 seconds. The S95 will only go down to 15 seconds. That eliminates the S95.III. The LX5 is the same as the Leica dLux 5. Also, Panasonic has been noted to be the manufacturer that builds the most reliable cameras. Only 1.9% have required maintenance during the warranty period. [..]The Nikon P7000 has been dogged by reliability issues. Thus the P7000 is eliminated.IV. The LX5's autofocus is lightning fast and does not hunt unlike the S95 and the P7000. However, the XZ1 is meant to be very fast as well but no one has one. Those that do aren't going to say anything negative about a product the Olympus factory has given or lent them because let's face it, would you jeopardize a nice cosy relationship with a major camera manufacturer?V. All new products these days are beta tested on the public. As much as I love the Olympus XZ1, it's not available and it's $499 and in six months it will be $399. I was the first sucker to buy an EP1 and it went down in price by $400 within as little as 5 months. Lesson learned.VI. But the XZ1 is just the purtiest little camera you ever did see. This was the hardest part, That XZ1 makes the LX5 look like something built in East Germany before the wall came down. The Leica version is a bit more pleasing to the eye but still nothing compares to the XZ1's stylishness. It's so pretty that I'd be babying it all day long and BAM! Eureka! That thought right there made me choose the LX5. I'm going to Cambodia, Vietnam, South China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and I need something proven reliable and tough that requires no coddling or cuddling.VII. The white LX5 arrives. It takes great shots. Adjust the sharpness in the menu and it's just as sharp as the others. Get a fat card so you can shoot raw in case you get that money shot that you really want to blow up to whatever large size your printer can spit out. Most of all enjoy.VIII. As for the Oly, when it has a proven track record and and shoots 16:9 at 9MP, then I might contemplate the XZ2. Until then, Hasta la vista baby.IX. Reality check. Are the images as good as my Olympus EP1. No they are not. However they are close. And the LX5 can go places the EP1 cannot. Yes, it is pocketable proviso you don't wear skin tight pants like a NY hipster. Lens cap? It's awesome. The first thing that goes on a compact camera are the plastic lens cover blades. After some usage one of them may just hang there like a lazy droopy eyelid on a drunk. No thanks. 24mm really is awesome. Try it. 90mm, wish it had more but the 24mm is a nice compromise especially in South East Asian temples. Dof, there is some and if you're creative and understand the fundamentals of photography then you can get some:)  It's the best camera money can buy for $400 bucks.X. You will get more creative with this little Panny, I guarantee it!Update: As James commented, the LX5 is made in Japan which adds another level of confidence in this little camera. Also, thus far I haven't taken one single shot in the 4:3 or 1:1 aspect ratio in which the LX5 shoots at a higher megapixel rate than any of the other aforementioned cameras (excluding the Leica Dlux5 which is the same camera). Granted, that that is a personal preference not applicable to those who prefer to shoot in the 4:3 & 1:1 aspect ratios.I've also done a comparison at 2-300% in photoshop between the XZ1 and LX5 and have found both to be equally as sharp in real life photos. Maybe the guys at Dpreview got a bad copy as has been speculated upon by other folks commenting on other sites. As for shots with bokeh, naturally the XZ1 will do better at 112mm (equivalent) at F2.5 than the LX at 90mm f3.3. But I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised with the bokeh that I did get at 90mm f3.3. Again, if you understand the fundamentals of depth of field and distances then you can get a lot out of this little gem.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just lovely", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1BJ4H8E3CZOFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera. I replaced the fiddly stock lens cap on mine with a JJC ALC-5 Auto Lens Cap for Panasonic DMC-LX5 & Leica D-LUX5 and instead of using the neck strap that came with it I use the wrist strap from my old Panasonic FH20. Now, after ~8 months, whenever I leave the house, this little camera is still in my front pocket.The metal body feels great and has proven very durable with daily use in all sorts of conditions indoors and out. Examining mine critically after 8 months of daily carry in my front pocket, I can see the paint starting to show a tiny bit of wear on the high spots on the base of the camera. I frequently prop mine up on bricks and rocks outside, so this is actually less wear than I expected. Aside from that, the camera still looks new.The external controls are well placed, plentiful and crisp in use. Tactile feedback is very good. The aspect ratio slider does occasionally get knocked out of position depending on how tight the squeeze is sliding it in and out of my front jeans pocket. Not a big deal since aspect ratio is immediately visible on the display once the camera is powered up.Operation is totally silent if you use the interface options to customize the shutter sound and control confirmation beeps. Even if someone notices me holding this camera, they never hear me using it. The LX5 records, but it never intrudes.The user interface is much better than my Olympus. Tons of customizable options make it easy to make this YOUR camera, set up the way you want for your style of shooting. :)Great controls.The LCD is very bright and sharp, with lush color. Excellent for reviewing and sharing shots. Full sun shining directly on the LCD will make it difficult to see. I have yet to find an external LCD that does any better under the same conditions, however.The lens is fast, sharp, quick, accurate focusing, and has an extremely desirable range (for me) of focal lengths: 24mm equivalent is a must have wide angle for interior and landscape shots; 35mm equivalent is a perfect \"normal\" length for just capturing what you eyes see; the 70-90mm equivalent is perfect for portraits. Macro capability is superb.

It came down to the Lumix DMC-LX5 versus the Canon S95 and G12.  And finally after much mulling over, I pulled the trigger on the LX5 but really had some concerns.  The Canon's have always served me well and I was a bit worried about image quality and usability/menu's.  Thankfully all my concerns were unfounded after unpacking and using the LX5 for the last few days.  My background is as a serious amateur in the old film-days and I currently have a food blog that I do digital photography for.  Here's my initial thoughts...Pluses for the DMC-LX5* Great solid build quality, the camera is a bit heavy but feels VERY sturdy with a lot of metal in the construction* Easy to use controls, pretty intuitive menu, Lumix relies a bit more on mechanical switches over the menu but not hard at all for me to learn* Portability is not as good as the S95 but I can still slide this camera into my jeans, front-pocket.  Yeah, I bulge a bit but that's not all bad...  :-)* Image quality is well above average, I'm still working out settings for color saturation but I have to believe I can get to where I want to be* Control, tons of control in terms of fiddling around with the image (see above), you just need to know what you're doing* Great lens, very bright and excellent in low light, love the diffused image quality at 2.0 apertureMinuses for the DMC-LX5* Thickness is definitely there in the camera, the lens cap adds a 1/4\" of depth for a non-functional feature* Lens slow to start up and telephoto. It's a very smooth and quiet mechanism but slow.* Busy back menu, there's a lot of stuff going on in the LED panel, still not sure about everything thereOverall it's a very good purchase to me, the camera gives me all the control I need with high quality images and most of the portability I need.  And it's 10% cheaper than the Canons I was considering.

Moro \"JM\"", "ReviewID": "RLNEQYRHIE0DL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATED 1/30/2013Still unfreakin' believable.  I love my LX5.  I was considering upgrading to the LX7 but why?  Really why?  This little LX5, after 15000+ images is still awesome.  Last week while traveling I came across a semi-frozen lake that had some amazing ice fractals and sculptures in the freezing shoreline.  I took a bunch of macro images and submitted 76 of them to my stock agency.  Out of the 76, 53 were accepted -- and the rest were not the cameras fault, but mine.  I don't think much has been written about the incredible macro mode in the camera enough!  It is amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  If you aren't careful the front of the lens will touch the subject!  That's how close I can get.  Many times I leave my 3, D700, or D800 plus the lenses at home and just travel with the LX5; that's how confident I am in it's ability to nail the shot for personal use, and nail the image for potential sales.UPDATED 3/15/2012I'm not well over 9000 images with this camera and am still thrilled.  In November, I took a four day trip to San Juan on vacation and as a scouting trip for an upcoming wedding i will be shooting there this summer.  I ONLY took my Lumix.  Man, what an absolute JOY to use.  It performed flawlessly!  and I mean flawlessly.  the images I came back with of the beach, trees, and old San Juan just blow me away!  I have them on my website at www dot viewfromthetopfloor dot comCheck them out.  When I return in July for the wedding shoot, I have to take all my dSLR equipment but I'm also taking my Lumix.  Once I'm done with the two day wedding shoot, I'm leaving the dSLR in the safe, and exploring with the Lumix.  Last November's trip was the second trip, the first was Quebec,  I've ever taken where I didn't pack a dSLR and didnt' worry about the image quality.  Even my stock agents, and my online micro sites have accepted my images shot on that trip with the Lumix.Not much else to say except if you want a walk-about camera, that shoots raw, jpeg, movies, and can handle up to iso 800 (even though it goes higher) with great quality get this camera!UPDATED 10/11/2011Just returned from two days of shooting images up in Quebec.  I only took my Lumix.  No dSLR, no lenses.  Just the LX5, my filters (of which I only used one) , battery, and memory cards.  What a joy.  So much fun just creating images, not worrying about lenses, etc.  It was very, very crowded on some of the more popular streets in old Quebec City so I was glad I didn't have the big dSLR and a bag to contend with.  The camera performed flawlessly from dawn through dusk.  I returned with over 1200 images (jpeg + raw) -- yet to be reviewed, but from what I've seen so far, many marketable images.  My only complaint, and a minor one at that is that the way I hold my camera at the ready in my right hand for some reason my finger presses the self-timer button and activates it.  I wish there were a way to \"lock\" the menu button.  My highest ISO was at 400.  I DID NOT use auto ISO feature.  I shot primarily in \"Aperture\" mode, ISO 80.  I used the \"sunset\" scene mode, well, at sunset to get saturation in the brickwork, and I used the \"IA\" mode on a couple of occasions.Battery life was great:  I got 497 jpeg+raw files the first day and the battery was down to one bar.  I probably could have gone another 100 shots if I had to.  I don't do much chimping though when I'm out shooting.  Rarely, unless the lighting is so strange I need to check exposure, do I review out in the field.  Nor do I delete images out in the field.  All that work is done at home, in the compute.I'm so thrilled with the LX5 and it's performance.  Today, I ordered the viewfinder as I did have some minor difficulties using the LCD in the sun.  It wasn't so much that I couldn't see the image, but what I had a difficult time determining was the polarizing levels as I rotated the filter while looking through the LCD.  I knew that was going to be an issue.  In December I will be in Puerto Rico, where I hope the sun is really shining so I want to make sure I can see what I'm shooting, and get it right.  I will report back on that as soon as I give it a good workout.UPDATED 9/26/2011This amazing camera just doesn't stop impressing me.  Photography is fun again!  This past weekend I went on a short-notice shopping trip. Took the LX5 instead of my dSLR equipment.  I found a farmers market where I shot many photos of the fresh vegetables, and pumpkins.  I also visited an older barn that was a treasure trove of images just waiting to be had.  Did I regret not having my dSLR?  No Way!  Once I arrived home around ten'ish I ingested the jpegs and Raws into LR3.  From that point,  I selected a total of nine  images to submit to one of the stock agencies (to test the Lumix capabilities) and by midnight I was done.  This morning I was notified they accepted three of the nine images.  The GREAT news is that the six rejections were not due to lack of sharpness, or oversharpening (keep in mind I submitted, as a test, the jpeg out of the camera), or any noise issues, they just did not care for my subject matter!How amazing is that?  That, quite frankly was my biggest concern:  That I would come upon a photo (and stock) rich shooting situation, and only have my Lumix with me and I would blow the opportunity to build up my stock library.  That seems to NOT be the case!  And, as I stated below in my original review, I'm still going on my trip, and I'm now more positive than ever about NOT taking my Nikons.  Did I miss the nikons?  No.  Not at all.  Also, keep in mind that some folks may have a problem with someone shooting with a \"professional camera\".  With just the LX5, I looked like another dumb tourist snapping shots.. LOL I hope that helps you make a more informed decision.I got this little gem and now am well over 2000 images. I shoot about 85% in \"A\" aperture mode as I shoot a jpeg and a raw file, and when I just want a snapshot, or don't want to fiddle with any settings I crank it over to the iA (intelligent auto) mode (jpeg only). In either mode, this camera just produces some gorgeous images in various formats -- from the 1:1 square to 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9 for wide-screen TV's.  I just returned from a three day jaunt in Maine where i used my dSLR (D700 and the holy trinity of Nikon lenses), plus this little beauty for those times when I wanted to go incognito -- say inside a restaurant, or where I didn't want to be noticed.  The images came out incredibly detailed, colorful, sharp and low noise, and just plain perfect.  I am a person that despises noise in images and this little camera produces clean, beautiful images at ISO 80, 100, and 200 in the right light.  Around 400 to 800 it has some noise, but I can deal with that in LR3.  I do have Auto ISO set in the iA mode to a max of 800 though.  I'd rather take my chances shooting at a lower shutter speed with the image stabilization on, rather than a higher ISO and noise.I had been searching for a small p+s with dSLR features and I do believe this is it.  My choices were to go with the Canon g12 or the Canon S95.  But I didn't go with the Canon S95 because of the lack of raw, or the G12 because of it's massive, unpocketable size.  Now, I will say that even though over the last 2000 shots or so I've shot about 85% with the the raw+jpeg combo, for my needs I've only needed the raw file a few times.  This camera just produces beautiful images.  Not sure how else to say it.  You can read about all the reviews here, and specs but seriously until you try it, you'll never know what we LX5 users are talking about.  In past years, I've used the G10, G11 from Canon but they were just waaaay to bulky to carry.  Even though this camera has the slightly protruding lens I can still fit it in my pants pockets where the others did not fit.Battery life:  I went 476 shots, shooting jpeg+raw about 85-90%, and the rest in the iA mode, PLUS about 25 short videos (under 1 minute each in length) before the camera died.  That's awesome as far as I'm concerned.  I did us the LCD for playback of images ONLY, not the video, and I used the flash TWICE as I'm not big on flash even with my dSLR.I also purchased the automatic lenscap as I didn't want to deal with the lumix lenscap even though I had it tied with the little string to the left side camera strap eyelet.  This little lens adapter just opens like a flower when you turn the camera on and closes when the lens retracts. No fuss, no mess.As an additional accessory I also purchased the filter adapter.  Not the panasonic, but an off brand for like 10$.  I then attached a 52 to 77mm step up ring so I can use my 77mm Singh-Ray filters on the Lumix.  Yes, I do get weird looks, but I must say I love using my filters and the camera handles them flawlessly.I am planning a four-day trip to San Juan in December and I am NOT taking ANY dSLR equipment.  I'm taking this Lumix LX5, and my filters, plus the battery charger and memory cards. That's it.  That is how confident I am this camera will do the job.  Even though the trip is more of a vacation, I do shoot stock for several companies and I do expect to be able to present great images taken with this little gem of a camera.I couldn't be happier with my Lumix.  I had been looking for something to have with me at all times as I didn't want to carry around a dSLR and I found it.  It's such a liberating feeling that I can get great images, anywhere, without the weight, bulk, and attention of the dSLR and a camera bag full of equipment!! And, I'm not even talking about it's ability to shoot HD videos!! It also does that, but that's not the primary reason I purchased it.  However, I have taken quite a few short videos of my new grandson just because I have it.

Also the LX5 has room for some customizations such as the wide angle lens, which I've never used so I don't know how well it plays, but I did just order the adapter tube and a few filters to try out. The P7000 and G12 seemed really good as well but they were just too bulky for what I was looking for.

It's a take anywhere, and take photos anywhere sort of camera that gives outstanding results. (And I guess that's why Leica re-brands the identical camera as their D-LUX5 and charges twice as much for it.. as Leica says about it \"Classic Leica Design\".)The only thing I didn't give it 5 stars on is \"Ease of Use\" (it got a 4, if there was 1/2, it would have been 4&1/2) Anyone buying it should buy Alexander White's book \"Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5\" (available from Amazon) - and read it carefully with the camera in hand.  The powerful features of the LX5 lead to a somewhat complex system of menus to access all of them. With White's book - these become much clearer. Of great use is the button that calls up the \"Quick Menu\" (a drop-down from the top version) - which is much simpler to use for everyday adjustments and settings. Remember that button!  The camera requires some skill to get the best out of it - but with a bit of time and thought - that best is going to be outstanding.I've taken photos in bright sun and snow (an almost impossible to take combo in the film world) to night-time moon/streetlight illuminated photos. I've been delighted with the results. The ability to also do manual adjustments, and bracketed exposure bursts makes it possible to get the impossible shots. The F2.0 Leica lens is outstanding for resolution and color clarity - I've done enlargements to poster size and still haven't reached the limits of the lens/camera combo.Do I like it - yeah, a bunch.

I have a Canon SD 1400 IS (which I love), a Lumix ZS7 (which was a disappointment) and I finally have a compact camera that I cannot put down. I have been shooting stills on manual setting capturing the combination of RAW and JPEG and shooting all of my video on Ai(allowing the camera to handle the settings) and the results have been outstanding. The lens is the key. Very wide and great for indoor shots. I have never been able to capture so much of the room as with this camera. I am loving taking shots indoors with no flash and still getting terrific exposures. I have yet to use the flash! This lens lets in so much light, once you have tried this approach you will never want to go back to the washed out flash shots. I was concerned about the size of the camera before it arrived, based on other reviews. Granted, it will not fit in the back pocket of your jeans. But this is not a large camera by any means. I was surprised at how small it really is. The protruding lens does catch a bit on my jacket pocket if I try to grab a quick shot, but it does not bother me once in the pocket. Granted it is winter, so warmer weather may change my mind a bit, but I have a feeling if the snow was not peltering down, the camera would not even find its way into a pocket. I would be too busy taking photos! The colors from this gem are amazing. If you buy one, take it with you to the grocery store on your next shopping trip. I could not help myself as I photographed the vibrant colors in the produce department and recorded the patterns of jars lining the glass aisle. This camera has turned me onto to composition and creativity again, something I had not delved into since I put my SLR and slide film away. The videos have been very good and I was especially impressed by the sound capture. Before I made this purchase I was considering The Canon S95, Nikon P7000 and even the Canon G12. I may well eventually buy the S95 and the G12 at some point, but I am glad I started with the LX5. I cannot imagine enjoying any of the others as much as this camera. One other tip I got from these reviews that I must echo. The RainbowImaging Auto Lens Cap is a must.

I also didn't want to spend a ton and worry about things like changing out lenses and all of that. Just give me something easy to use, that will take clear photos right out of the box, and I'm happy.Very pleased to find this camera does all of that. At one point I turned the lights off with just some dawn light coming from outside, and even then it took a decent enough picture. No problems with \"normal\" indoor lighting or closeups or really anything.The video capability is quite good as well, though for the moment I don't see a lot of need for that, but I might later.

I am still exploring the feature of LX5. I compare LX5 and Sony DSC-W530 on landscape photos and it is not easy to tell the difference. DSC-W530 has a 26mm wide-angle lens. LX5 24 mm covers a little bit larger area but the difference is very small.There is a big difference in indoor photos. LX5 got much much better photo than DSC-W530. Of course they are not the same class of camera. I will not give up my DSC-W530 yet, because I can put it in my shirt pocket.I went to Metropolitan Museum of Art and used my new LX5 to take pictures of the paintings. The quality of the photos is astonishing. I played them on my Sony 46\" LCD 1080P TV and the photos are exactly the same as what I saw in the museum. The color is very precise. I zoomed in the details of Van Gogh's paintings and it came out good.I noticed that the 4:3, 3:2 and 16:9 ratios for LX5 are well designed. The covered areas are almost the same. I believe 4:3 is the best. It caught the largest area of the scene. The 1:1 just chops off the areas.I noticed DSC-W530 16:9 sacrifies a large area. I recommend using 4:3 on DSC-W530.Manual Focus of LX5 has a nice feature of using cursor buttons to adjust. There is a yellow bar on LCD. It is getting narrower when it focus. There is no explanation of the yellow bar on the instruction. I try it several times and I can not tell the difference of automatic focus and manual focus on picture quality. The MF Asssitant Focus time is too short and the enlarged area disappears too soon, I guess I need more practice.In general LX5 is very good in low light(indoor) environment. It is very good for close objects. The colors are very precise. The speed is very fast (I noticed I have to hold it a little bit longer, otherwise the picture is not that sharp, especially indoor.)Update: 9/28/2012I just came back from a tour of Canadian Rocky Mountain and about 1000 photos were taken.

I soon discovered the LX5 and the D-LUX5 are 95% the same but have some differences.  For example, the LX5 has a different casing with a grip molded into it + no red dot.  The most significant difference is the a Dlux 5 firmware is supposedly better - based on comparisons on the web. I think it might be. In addition with the DLUX5 you get lightroom, etc which is really excellent software.  Other things such as the lens, etc. are the same.  I choose the LX5 over the DLUX5 primarily due to price- less than 1/2 price. Both cameras are made by Panasonic.

I have owned many digital cameras, including the Panasonic DMC-ZS7. The LX5 is definitely an enthusiast's camera. It offers some of the easiest full manual controls I've seen on a point and shoot. There is a thumb dial on the rear of the camera that you can push in to adjust the exposure compensation. There is a slider switch on the side of the lens that allows you to switch between AF, Macro AF, and MF. The Macro AF is slightly slower than the standard AF, but it allows you to focus on subjects about 1cm from the lens. This allows for great close up shots of flowers, bugs, or other tiny things. I've used the manual focus a few times, which is quite easy to use, for a few shots on a tripod. The standard AF works quite well for normal shooting and is fast and accurate. There is also a manual switch on top of the lens which allows you to switch the aspect ratio which can be fun to play with. Image quality is quite impressive for a small camera. I typically shoot this camera in RAW and limit the ISO to 800. I'm a little picky with digital noise in the photos and try to keep the camera under ISO400. I feel images are usable up to 800, but don't like to push it over that. The RAW files that come out of this camera are amazing at low ISO and are very close to entry level dSLR cameras. The JPG files are the best I've seen in a point and shoot and offer some cool effects you can choose including miniature effect. I would say the images are noticeably better than the ZS7 which I think does quite well among other pocketable cameras. The LX5 is the first point and shoot i've used since really getting into photography that I've been surprised and impressed with the image quality. It does have the advantage of a larger image sensor which helps a lot with image quality. I primarily shoot a Canon 5D, but this camera is surprisingly convenient and a nice companion to a DSLR. I would recommend this to someone looking for a more advanced point and shoot.PROSexcellent image qualityfast lensfast autofocussmall size, though slightly too large to put in your pocketwide angle lensConsthe lens cap is not built in (not a huge issue, but slightly inconvenient)in full auto, the flash does not automatically pop up. you need to pop it up manually in order for it to be on. this is not a problem for me, but when you hand the camera to someone who is not familiar with cameras, this can be a problem.Wish ListLarger image sensor (maybe micro 4/3)Even better ISO performance", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceeds my expectations", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R1UAU90ML5D4BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First thing I must say is kudos to Amazon !

I own two DSLR's and over a dozen compacts, including several Panasonic's latest offerings. I really don't like carrying either DSLR around, and I was never all too happy with the image quality of the compacts where image quality really mattered.Then I read about the LX5 which brought back memories of reading about seemingly gung-ho online reviews of the LX3 a few years back. I decided I needed a compact with a F2.0 lens. Amazon was offering it at a discount, so I bought it.I've been much happier with the picture quality offered by the LX5 than with any of the dozens of compacts I've owned over the years. Actually, the last time I was very happy with the image quality of a compact, in absolute terms (i.e., not comparing with other compacts), was with my old Fuji FX5 with its SuperCCD construction. The LX5's image quality is vastly helped by its top-notch Leica lens at a fast speed of F2.0 (at the wideangle 24mm setting). That 2.5 to 3.2 times as much light as most top-brand compacts (like my other Pannys and Sonys and Fujis and Olympus) with maximum f-stops of 3.1 to 3.5, respectively. For example, several other Pannys have a maximum aperture of F3.3, which admits only 1/3 the amount of light as the LX5's F2.0 aperture. At the maximum 3.8X zoom end, the maximum aperture is F3.3. At the normal focal length of 50mm, the maximum f-stop is 2.6.[BTW, the formula for calcualting the light-admitting ratio of two f-stops is, in Excel, =-2*LN(A1/A2)/LN(SQRT(2)) where cell A1 has the faster of the two f-stops, e.g., A1 has 2.0 and A2 has 3.3 - just thought you might be interested to know :) ]Many advanced photographers, amateur or pro, would agree that the maximum aperture spec of a camera system is all too often improperly ignored when choosing a camera. The F2.0 rating, and the apparent high quality of the Leica-licensed lens, make the LX5 a good shooter in low-light conditions. Now, do NOT expect this to have the same performance as a DSLR or even a Four Thirds camera, because the LX5 still uses a compact, 1/1.63\" CCD sensor, which cannot match the light and color sensitivity of a DSLR sensor that is larger -- the LX5's sensor is about 45 mm^2 in area whereas a Four Thirds sensor is 225 mm^2 in area and, say, the Nikon APS-C sensor in DSLR's from Nikon, Pentax and Sony measure 370 mm^2 in area.But the LX5 is a compact, and its design reflects the trade off between high quality image and portability. Due to its protruding, 3.8X lens, you cannot just put it in a backpocket like I do with my Sony compacts, but it's far, far lighter than the smallest DSLR out there, so it's something I can carry in my jacket pocket or hang around my neck without feeling the weight. And since at the wideangle focal length it lets in over 3x as much light as a typical Sony compact, I can do things like shoot in dimly lit situations or achieve a blurred background.Because I've been using Panasonic cameras for quite a few years, I'm familiar with their user interface, and the LX5 largely conforms to that interface tradition. If you're a newbie to Panny's shooting world, you'll need to take some time to get used to its interface. The interface itself is not difficult to understand, but the myriad options can give you quite a headache. Of course, options are good for a serious photographer, amateur or pro, so if you take the time to read the electronic manual, you will get the most out of this camera.I want to end this quick review by emphasizing that the LX5 is not a replacement for a larger DSLR. It's a compact, but one that'll likely give you satisfactory indoor shots without using the flash or very high ISO.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera - new firmware available (2.0)", "Author": "R.

If you don't count the many film-based point-and-shoot cameras I've had over the years, the Lumix LX5 is my fourth camera.  I really started with a Nikon FG, went digital with the Nikon CoolPix 995, upgraded last year to a pretty nice Kodak EasyShare Z915 which, despite being about 1/5 the price I paid for the Nikon, was a good upgrade and had a nice 10x optical zoom.Now comes this Lumix LX5.

They put real optical image stabilization into most of their stuff. I have a Panasonic camcoder as well, both are really good in stabilizing the image. Don`t believe to other brands that their software stuff is as good as a real optical stabilization. It is just not true. It is almost impossible to make blurred pictures with this.

I actually bought a knock-off version of it (as the Panasonic one was over $100).  It really has a quality old school feel to it, and you no longer have to worry about using the (terrible) stock neckstrap.  The only letdown with this case is that the Tripod Socket Mount is on the far end of the case, rather than the middle.  As, with the extra weight of the case, it causes the camera to no longer sit on Flexible/Gorillapod tripods - rather it just makes them collapse or fall to the side.Raynox DCR-250 Macro LensLet's face it, Marco photography is the bomb.

I have large hands and like a little weight to my camera so the S95 was eliminated. The Olympus was great on paper but serious smearing problems kept me from going any further with it. That left the TL500 with its super fast F1.8 lens, gorgeous maneuverable screen and lower price against the LX5 with its slightly longer range, more options, faster focus and processing. As much as I like the screen on the TL500 and the lens it's inability to fire multiple RAW shots due to slower processing and its sub-par video capabilities I just had to pull the trigger on the LX5.I am VERY HAPPY I did. The menus and options are so easy on this camera that after a while curiosity should turn even the hardcore auto users into better photographers that use more of what this gem has to offer. The video is amazing for a small camera. If you have ultra steady hands or especially if you have a tripod and follow the camera's direction in manual exposure mode it can NEARLY see in the dark!You will want to get at least a class 6 card for the LX5. I noticed a slight improvement in speed when I installed a class 10 card, so that's what I have in there now. However I didn't notice any boost going from the class 10 transcend to the superfast class 10 samsung extreme. So the cheaper transcend is the way to go in my opinion.I simply couldn't be happier with my purchase.

A near- identical copy of the Leica DeLux 5--at half the price--this tough little jewel-like tank of a camera takes splendid pictures, portrait, landscape, and especially macro shots.  Totally TOTALLY impressed, and Ive been shooting pics for nearly 50 years with all kinds of gear.  So never mind the clueless naysayers and sausage-fingered klutzs, if you want a quality, fixed-lens P&S; with some of the best and fastest glass on the market, go for this little gem.  Sure it doesnt have 12x optical zoom, but, really, do you NEED that?  24-90 is the *perfect* range for a camera of this size.  Just get it already!!(Postscript regarding Amazon customer service: the first LX5 they sent me was clearly a customer return, the camera was loose in the box, it was dirty, and had a BIG fingerprint on the lens!  Although it took me a good deal of digging in the dark (like being in a coal mine with a dying flashlight) to find Amazon CS phone#, the CS rep processed the return and had a PERFECT replacement to me the next day.  This is the first time in 12 years of dealing with Amazon where I had a problem, and it was resolved with perfection.)(2nd postscript: attempted to shoot a fashion show for the first time using the video feature.  All went well except for one detail: I shot AVCHD.  TIP: unless U have Windows 7, which can play back AVCHD's.mts files, do NOT use the AVCHD setting for videos to play back on a computer, instead use M-JPeg.  Makes life a little simpler, because MJPGS can be viewed in just about any player.  I tried to attempt playback of the .mts files using the enclosed software, but I could not get it to work.  Plus using Vista, I'm not brave enough to attempt any third party .mts player downloads.)BTW, on camera, the videos look excellent, with the optical zoom operating near perfectly and smoothly.

G11 strengths include a longer lens and more logical (to me) ergonomics. I like the articulated LCD, but it's smaller than the now-standard 3.0 inch LCD, and swinging it out all the time tends to be a pain. The video is not up to contemporary standards.So enter the LX5W. It is smaller than the G11 and it has a fixed LCD, a shorter but faster lens and faster shot-to-shot times. To many, the lens cap seems to be a deal breaker, but many DSLR owners have reported they are OK with the lens cap. The LX5W also fits perfectly in the Lowepro Classified 30 pouch.I can easily justify buying this camera simply for the HD video. The purple lines do appear when you shoot into a strong light source, as reported. But the video is demonstrably better than the Canon G11.My great surprise is how much I love the wider end of the LX5W lens. I'm shooting wider more often than I did with the G11, in part due to the LX5W's faster lens.The LX5 might be a great addition to your camera collection, especially if you value small size, a fast lens, and faster shot-to-shot times.I love it!", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "DMC-LX5 great!", "Author": "Stephen Atkinson", "ReviewID": "R22KR1L91ZXFDQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hesitated about spending $$$ on an upper-end compact camera when so many cheaper models are available, but glad I made the choice!

I also, if possible, wanted to stay with Panasonic as I had become familiar with their menu system. Naturally my first instincts were to look at the newer super zoom models, so I compared the FZ30, FZ40, and then finally a FZ100.  The FZ35 produced the best pictures of the three with the least noise, but I wanted the more advanced features of the FZ40 or FZ100.  It seems that the newer or more advanced the model the lower the quality of the images, and all three cameras exhibited a lot of noise under less than ideal conditions.  Although not a professional by any means, I do take pictures on our travels under less than perfect light conditions and wanted a camera that could perform satisfactorily under low light.  I was interested in the FZ100 because the video quality (1080i) was excellent, but still images left a lot to be desired with mixed and inconsistent results.  Despite my concerns about IQ, I was about to settle in on the FZ100 when a neighbor loaned me her LX3.  Although it lacked the zoom range, I found taking pictures with the camera was a complete joy and that the image quality was superior to the above mentioned cameras.  In side by side comparisons the noise level was far below that of the FZ100.  No contest here.  It seemed like it was difficult to take a bad picture.  Knowing that the LX5 had a longer zoom and more features was a plus.  So I ordered the LX5 and although I have only had it a while, I have thoroughly enjoyed using it.  I'm very impressed that a camera so small (especially compared to the super zooms) could do so much and have the great image quality that it does.  The combination of features, size, and excellent image quality make the LX5 the perfect camera for me. Highly recommended.

I own a standard point-and-shoot camera that isn't an adequate substitute because the pictures from the P&S; are good but not great and the controls are limited. However, I think I've found the solution - the Panasonic LX5 which I purchased from Amazon.In my judgment, although the compact Panasonic LX5 could be used as a P&S; camera,  it is in a different category. The pictures from the LX5 are excellent and it has all the same controls that my big SLR has. What a delightful camera to use. It fits in a pouch on my belt. And it only weighs 9 oz. including battery and memory card.Here is what I like about the LX5 and why I choose it rather than the Canon S95, a camera of similar design:1. Fast Lens -  in telephoto mode it shoots at f 3.3, a whole stop faster that the S95's f 4.9.2. Macro Setting -  can focus down to 1 cm, true macro,  while the S95 goes only to 5 cm.3. Battery Capacity - up to 400 pictures per charge while the S95 charges to 200 or less.4. Size - because of faster lens and better battery, it is slightly larger that the S95.5. HD videos - can produce videos for HD TV which the S95 can't doFeatures in common with the S95:6 Ability to Reproduce fine Detail:  - it can produce high resolution pictures.7 Excellent Image Stabilization: - I've made good hand held images to 1/15 of a second.8 RAW Option - possible to increase image quality by shooting in RAW, more control.9 Sensor Size - sensor is 50% larger than standard P&S; camera, allows for larger pixels.Here are the things I did not like about the LX51 Removable Lens Cap - something that Panasonic should correct in the next upgrade of this camera. The lens cap either goes into your picket, what a pain, or it is attached by a small string to your camera. Neither are very satisfactory. A Chinese manufacturer has designed an \"auto lens cap\" for this camera. Several vendors sell it through Amazon: One is: \"Rainbow Auto Lens Cap for Panasonic Lumix DMC LX-5\". I'm going to buy one and try it.2 Camera Manual  - the manual is supplied by Panasonic on a CD in PDF format. It is 226 pages long and not an easy read. I found it difficult, to impossible, to find information about specific camera functions. It is especially bad in explaining where the menu options are located in the many menus and how they work. And there are many menu options. Alexander S. White's book \"Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5\" may be a necessary addition.

No, I did not ding the LX5 a star for the malfunction of the S90.]  Four reasons for ordering the LX5 were: (1) the new Canon Powershot S100 was completely out-of-stock despite me waiting over 4 weeks prior to a vacation trip (Yes, Canon was out-of-stock right before Christmas.  Perhaps due to the recent floods in Thailand and possibly related to rumored production problems with the S100), (2) the lens on the LX5 was somewhat faster than the Canon Powershot S95,(3) I read very good reviews of the LX5 after Panasonic released its 2.0 firmware which fixed some of the JPG quality issues and (4)Amazon ran an unbelievably great sub-$300 Black Friday sale price which effectively made it cost neutral to the sale price of the the Canon Powershot S95.PROs:The image quality has been very good, especially in RAW format.  Photos have been rather sharp.  Color has been good, but I would advise shooting in JPG+RAW mode with at least a 16GB SD card.  The single button 720P video quality is very nice.  The battery life on the LX5 has been better than the battery life on my Canon S90.  The build quality of the LX5 has appeared to be quite solid for the first 3 weeks.CONs:Unfortunately, the menu set-up does not appear to be as intuitive as the Canon menu system; however, part of this will pass as I get more familiar with a new menu system.  Yes, it is not as compact or light as the Canon S100, S95, or S90.  It is maybe 40% heavier than the Canon S90 or S95. The LX5 has eyelets/lugs on both sides for installing the LUMIX camera strap which is included; however, I will most likely replace it with a 3rd party leather wrist strap.  As others have noted, the lens cap is not automatic and requires manual removal.  There is a 3rd party replacement of lens cap that is a work-around to this deficiency. Due to the position of the flash (which is not an automatic-pop up unlike the Canon S90), there is a shadow cast on the lower right hand side of the photos when you use the flash on photographing objects that are closer than 1-2 feet (i.e. macro).I have paired the LX5 with a large-size Crumpler \"Tuft\" case and have recently ordered a leather camera strap from[...].Overall, this is not bad for a 1 1/2 old model.  For Panasonic fans out there, it is worthy choice compared with the GF3 due to the \"relatively compact\" nature vs some 4/3rds models.

Andersen", "ReviewID": "R1I0BFVOS0KXBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a compact camera that was small enough to carry around everywhere all the time, but with the flexibility to get exactly the shot I wanted if the occasion arose.  I also wanted something that would shoot raw images, since I like to work on my photos in Photoshop, and lower resolution JPEGs just don't give as much flexibility with adjustments.  I did a lot of searching, and this is the camera I decided on.  I haven't regretted the choice.  The one drawback with this camera for my needs is that it doesn't zoom further - but if it didn't the lens wouldn't be as fast as this one, which would mean sacrificing low-light and narrow depth of field.  A longer lens would mean a bigger camera - or would have required that I spend quite a bit more for multiple lenses and an interchangeable lens system.  This one was in my price range, and the faster lens was more important to me than the zoom potential, so I'm quite happy with it.Others have given detailed accounts of the features, I'm just going to note a few things I really like about it.First off, I like the feel of it in my hand.  It's solidly built and I like the texture and the grip, and it has the right heft so that it doesn't feel like a toy.  It would have been nicer, I think, if they'd designed it with an automatic lens cover rather than the hanging lens cap, but I think there would have been a trade off in the size of the lens if they'd done that.While there is a very wide range of options, presets and manual capabilities here, they are laid out so clearly that it's a cinch to select them.  I love the fact, for example, that there's a dedicated slider on the lens to set the aspect ratio of pictures, and that this is not just a digital adjustment but actually changes how the image records on the sensor (so that with 16:9 you get a \"true\" 16:9 picture and not just a picture that's cropped from 4:3 for example).  There's another slider on the lens to select from Auto Focus, Manual Focus and Auto Focus Macro.  That means if I want to get an extreme close-up shot of a bug or a flower or a texture, I don't have to do anything else but move the slider and move in close.  The menus are easy to follow, and I like the fact that in picture preview mode you can change the number of photos shown and even zoom in on individual photos just by using the zoom knob.  I like that not everything is in the menus - that you can select the shooting mode with a dial on top of the camera, and that there is a dedicated movie recording button.It's not bad as a camcorder, by the way.  The movie quality compares favorably to that of my latest HD model Flip Camera.  The sound is a bit more noisy, but not bad in the right conditions.  Obviously, for better sound and better images you'd want a dedicated camcorder - or a DSLR with an external microphone.  For many uses - and especially just to capture memories - this would do just fine.  You can capture video in a very high quality but effectively compressed AVCHD lite mode (which is great for playback on HD televisions and for conversion to Blu-ray), or to Motion JPEG with a .mov extension (that's more convenient for editing in iMovie and playback or sharing on the computer).What matters most, of course, is the picture quality.  I've been very happy with it - you can easily take good pictures with this camera and with a bit of care can take some great pictures with it.  When I hand this over to my kids I put it into instant automatic mode and it shoots JPEGs that come out looking good every time.  They look good enough that I keep it in that mode if my focus is just to capture a memory in the moment.  But if I want to get a certain kind of emphasis in my photograph - by using narrow depth of field or by changing the shutter speed to capture action, for example, it's easy enough to do.  I think this would be an ideal camera for someone who's just moving up from a simpler compact with more limited options and really wants to begin to learn how cameras work before stepping up to a more serious DSLR.  This camera won't meet every need, but for its convenient size and incredible flexibility it's a great tool for the right occasion.

My daughter carried her Sone NEX-3. Based on the photographic results I would say the Panasonic won hands down. It gave up low light performance to the Sony, but because of it's size it was always with me, and the external controls allowed me much quicker access to the critical adjustments (pretty much everything on the Sony is reached with the touch screen on the back).  I came back with the nicest group of photos that I have taken in many years, and truly enjoyed using the camera.

I got the bug about six months ago and did some really in-depth research. Being in advertising I have quite a few professional commercial photographer friends who without skipping a beat said DSLR. However, my objective was to get something I can carry in my laptop bag. To be honest, still images were a secondary priority because I wanted a camera that can shoot very good video.Bought this from Amazon and salute to each and everyone involved, it arrived well before the estimated time at my friend's house who was visiting the US. He reached Pakistan yesterday and I picked it from him and boy the build quality reminds you of the good old days when things used to have a solid feel to them.I know absolutely nothing about photography. The days it took for my friend to come back, I saw some videos on YouTube to get at least the most basic of stuff. One mistake I made was not to order a pouch with the camera.So I started taking some pictures and they look good. Well not like those taken with the huge DSLRs they will be using in tomorrow's shoot but for the size and money, I think this is more than enough. So now to the main purpose; video. Shot a colleague playing guitar with the 'pinhole' effect under ordinary light and with a little bit of post, I think it can be aired on TV. That's how good it is.AGAIN, this is not your 35mm Arri camera and neither is this the professional Canon/Leica/Nikon/HB. If you want that result, you should be prepared to carry a suitcase with you. This is for on-the-go but much superior to the regular point and shoot that I have seen with friends.The detachable lens cover yes is a bit odd for practicality but it does have that nostalgic feel to it. I bought a generic wrist band/strap for it, makes more sense. Its only a day old and I will update here but if the regular P&S; don't offer you the quality and the DSLR are cumbersome, this is a perfect middle ground.Panasonic, how big a hassle would it be to put stereo mic on this? It's 2011. That's my biggest complaint. Other than that, I doubt you'll regret buying this camera. And this is from someone with least knowledge about photography than everyone here. Go for it!Update 28th September 2011:Absolutely LOVE this camera. I have taken it with me on every TV commercial shoot and every time I have learnt something new. The Intelligent Auto mode is amazing but I am under oath not to use it because I want to learn how to take pictures manually.If you are in the process of research on which camera to buy, stop and get this one. I have not used the built-in flash at all since I bought this camera, that's how amazing it is in low light. I saw people complain about losing the lens cap. THIS IS IMPORTANT: there is a small thread in the box that you attach to the cover and then to the camera. That way it hangs.Few suggestions to Panasonic: a) Put in a stereo microphone PLEASE! (b) Add Wifi, it makes perfect sense since almost everyone now has Wifi. That way one would transfer pictures over the network.

I loved the features, responsiveness, size, and capabilities.  When we returned, I was disappointed with some of the (video) results, and ended up selling it because of what I saw as some serious limitations -- mostly video related.  There was blooming (purple vertical lines) during video & some still shots.  The built-in microphone was criminally bad.  The joystick on the back was fiddly.  The battery life was pretty poor.  The UI had some annoying quirks, too - you had to have the aspect-ratio switch in the \"right\" position to record video.  A real hassle if you always shoot stills in 4x3 RAW, and video in 16x9.I've been wanting to replace my (un-replaced) Fuji F20 and/or my Nikon D40.  After looking at the new Nikon 3100 and Sony a55, I decided that maybe having video on an (albeit light & small) DSLR wasn't what I, as a dad of 2 young girls, needed in my life.So I picked up an LX5, gave it a once-over, and found they pretty much fixed all my niggles.  The purple blooming was (mostly) gone, the audio was fixed & AVCHD was added (a +/-), replaced the joystick with GF-1 wheel & video button, battery life is supposed to be better.  They also improved the sensor & IS a little.  They also enabled optical zoom during video AND continuous auto-focus.  It's like a pocket video camera that looks like a point & shoot.  It's also a CCD based camera, so you don't get the CMOS jell-o when you shoot video of small fast creatures scurrying about.  The added video record button corrects the UI issues mentioned above.It's no DSLR (4 stars for not increasing the sensor size, and being almost as expensive as a DSLR!), but it's reasonably fast, semi-pocketable, very flexible, and going on our coming trip to Mexico this year.  :-)", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Absolutely love it for stills and HD video.", "Author": "Book Reader \"bob_spez\"", "ReviewID": "R7R8KL0Q9PZ5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because I saw a number of reviews complaining about Panasonic honoring their warranty I also bought the Panasonic 3 year extended warranty. Hope I never need it, but if I do it seems I must drop the camera before I send it in since the extended warranty only covers accidental drops and spills, while the regular warranty may be denied for alleged owner misuse. It seems warranties are the dirty side of retailing these days. But I digress.I also bvought this great cheap case for this camera on Amazon: \"EzFoto Black Simulated Leather Case for Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX5\". It's a great value. But now on to the camera...This camera is a marvel of technology. I bought it for stills and primarily for HD video, after having good luck with a second hand Lumix DMC-FZ30 I bought on ebay about a year ago. The Lumix camera Leica lenses are very fine and I am very happy with them.  I bought the LX5 for a number of reasons and have been happy with all of them\"PROS:1. F2 lens. Unbelievable performance in low light with this lens on stills and HD video. I used the camera in a darkened hospital room to take stills and videos of my new granddaughter with no flash and no room lighting, except what came in from the windows  with closed curtains. The images were actually brighter on the stills and the video than what I saw with my eyes in the room.2. HD video (1280 x 720 with 48,000 Khz 16 bit stereo audio). The Panasonic software is (as I expected) totally useless to process the HD video, but using free software to convert the Panasonic MTS files to AVI files at full 1280 x 720 resolution produces unbelievably crisp HD video (I can read the time on a person's watch clarity) with great sound when viewed with free viewer software like SMPlayer. There is even free software on the web to create self executing AVI exe files which will let you burn the files to a data CD or DVD and let anyone view them on their Windows computers without having to find viewers, codecs, etc., to be able to view the HD files properly.  Or you can burn them to blu ray if you have a blu ray burner and player.3. If you are into video, this camera allows you to set both aperture and shutter speed in video mode. It's not required to do so, I shot my video at f2 in Aperture mode. But this capability is something that only was available on professional production quality (probably shoulder mounted) video cameras until very recently.  And to have this capability in a camera you can carry in a jacket pocket is incredible to me.4. The auto focus is excellent and takes a fraction of a second to track, and is silent.5. The built in stereo mics produce excellent sound. I got no auto focusing noise or any other sound artifacts. What I got on the video was true to what was said in conversation around me.CONS:I have found no cons on this camera, but a con of shooting HD video is file size. For a minute of full 1280 x 720 video with stereo sound, the MTS file produced will be 100MB. Using a converter to full HD 1280 x 720 AVI brings it down to 50MB. When shooting HD video, the camera told me I had 14 minutes of time available.  Whether that was due to the battery, or the 2 GB SD card I bought on Amazon \" SanDisk SDSDH2002GA11 2GB Ultra II SD Memory Card (2-Pack)\" I'm not sure. But the card and camera performed flawlessly. Still, these are large files. You don't have to shoot in HD, you can shoot hours at a lower resolution, but after seeing the quality of the HD video I couldn't not use it. Also, as mentioned above, I only found one software viewer for windows, SMPlayer, that displayed the HD AVI files flawlessly. Also for editing HD on my 8 year old desktop running Windows XP with SP2, and a 1.59 Ghz AMD chip and 1.21GB of RAM, the choices were slim. But if I can do it on this PC, I guess anyone who wants to can as well.In summary, about a year and a half ago I was all set to Purchase a Sony DSLR, but they were out of stock so I bought the second hand Lumix DMC-FZ 30 on ebay instead. I really liked the Sony cameras and Zeiss lenses ever since I got a Sony S-85 many years ago. A year later this Lumix LX5 seems to me to be much more camera, at about 1/4 the price and 1/4 the size and weight as the Sony DSLR I was going to buy. While the output of the Lumix/Leica has a slightly softer look than the Sony/Zeiss, I like it just a well.

This camera was over my budget for a POS, but it was way cheaper than dSLR that I don't really use, and cheaper than the rangefinder camera that I really wanted, and seemed to offer many of the features that I need.  It's definitely a good investment.Pros:* Sharp lens, fast focus, big f2.0 aperture!* Presets are intuitive and menus are easy to navigate - This is the first digital POS (or digital SLR for that matter) that I've used that has an intuitive interface.  Once you figure out the letters on the top dial (e.g., A = aperture priority, S = shutter priority, Ai = Auto, etc), you can control exposure and depth of field without breaking out the manual. After using the Lumix, the menus on my Nikon DSLR and my old Canon POS are a real pain to the point where I just leave everything on auto.* Love the color palette setting (on the top knob) which lets you play with vintage coloring, B&W;, etc in the camera rather than in Photoshop or Lightroom.  The \"smooth B&W; film setting\" is actually my favorite so far because it's really close to my style of B&W; printing in a wet darkroom.* Solid construction - It's not too heavy but is a good size to hold in my size 6 hands (e.g., S women's gloves).* Easy to clean - I melted a chocolate peanut butter egg from Easter on it by accident and removed the mess with a little rubbing alcohol and everything was fine!Cons:* Low light photos still need some more work on the noise reduction.  I have heard that the LX5 is supposed to do better in that regard, but I don't see much of a difference between images from my friend's LX3 and my LX5.* If you're used to using a camera where the built-in flash will go off in Auto mode (well, automatically), then you're in for a surprise - as far as I can tell, you have to manually deploy the flash before the auto-flash kicks in.  With an f2.0 maximum aperture, you probably won't need a flash in most indoor situations - but this is just something I have to get used to.So my overall rating is 5 stars, minus 0.5 stars for the low-light noise reduction - a solid camera and a good investment overall.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm picky and this scratched my itch!", "Author": "Lawrence Jacobsen \"LJguitar\"", "ReviewID": "R175IQPA60CFJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shoot with DSLR cameras with a host of lenses, but was looking for a smaller camera with the capability to shoot RAW and great resolution.

There's minimal shutter lag; the LX-5 shoots fast.The lens zooming to 90mm is great -- the out-of-focus areas around the focused area are still wonderfully attractive -- nicely-executed lens design.I really like the one-shot film clip capability; now I don't have to change my format from 3:2 and turn the knob to Movie mode before I can film. And you can zoom while you're filming. Sound quality is really good and focus adjusts smoothly.I especially like the fact I can use a EVF - it makes the camera useful for steady and quick street-style photography. It has a diopter adjustment knob so one can customize it for their vision. Put the LX-5 on burst mode and you have a stealth shooter!Negatives: Doesn't shoot unlimited bursts like the LX-3, which can keep on shooting on burst mode till your SD card maxes out if you want. On the LX-5, I can only shoot 3 shots on a burst and then I have to wait until it finishes before I shoot again.Some key functions are not as readily available from the top levels -- exposure compensation, auto bracketing, flash on-off, flash power up and down, etc. Now you have to choose which one you want to put on the Function button. On the LX-3, I could easily access these options with one button. Hopefully this could be adjusted on firmware upgrades.Also in the LX-3, the movable guidelines could be modified and shifted from the display button while you're setting up your shot. In the LX-5 you have to go back to deep in the menu functions to move it to where you want it.Negative waiting to be a positive: The new battery on the LX-5 does allow more shots per charge and that's a plus. But the negative, to date - October 13, is that you cannot buy an additional battery because Panasonic has not made them available for purchase yet in the US.

Durand", "ReviewID": "R3P5FFDM4I1UAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much research and comparison to the Canon S95, I decided to purchase this camera during the recent Gold box promotion.  I would like to point out some impressions that I find pertinent.Build Quality / Design: The build quality does not disappoint, it is appears very well built and feels very sturdy in your hand.  It also has a definite heft to it that is not common in most P&S; cameras. By nature of it's more retro looks it is has a lot of buttons, sliders and outward controls that some might interpret as  less refined than its competitors in design, namely the Canon S95 which is noticeably more svelte.  Compare the two and decide on the one that best appeals to you.Size: The camera is not what I would call ultra-compact. I would refer to it as more of a mid-size camera. While it can be placed into pockets the pocket has to be large. The lens protrusion and lens cap make the camera thick compared to true pocket cameras. I find it to be a nice size but if you want utmost portability you might want to check out the Canon S95 or even the Canon Elph 300hs which is actually a surprisingly good P&S; camera.Ease of use: The menu is standard Panasonic style and it is very intuitive. However some things that should be more readily accessible (in my opinion) are hidden within a very extensive menu system.  The most notable item is the adjustment for flash intensity or bracketing. These functions are on page 6 (or 7 I have to look again) of the menu. In previous Panasonic cameras this was accessible via the buttons on the camera and quick to adjust; now you have to dive into the menu.  However, there is a small workaround this \"issue\".  Within the camera settings you can set the camera to remember the last position on the menu system. I simply turn this feature on and leave the menu parked at the flash setting spot; that way every time I hit the menu button it immediately pulls up the flash setting.Controls: The plethora of controls, either via direct buttons on the camera, or via menu access is extensive. Many items are accessible for your tailoring that are not typically accessible in P&S; cameras. I personally like the ability to turn down noise reduction, since I prefer to preserve detail over an artificially softened picture.Picture quality: I have been impressed so far with the pictures I have taken. Detail is very good and the lens, as many have mentioned, appears to be very sharp.  Noise is very well controlled up to ISO 400, although in certain areas of shadows, you can notice color blotching / yellow blotches, even at ISO as low as 200.  They are very small and only noticeable under very critical viewing. They are likely more visible to me because I turn down noise reduction on purpose.  Ability to shoot Raw is very good but to me pictures taken as JPG's with noise reduction turned down have been so good that I have not found any need to go to the RAW file.  I suspect at ISO's above 800 though the RAW would outperform the JPG.  The camera seems to be programmed with ISO 400 as its normal upper limit, almost as if the engineers know that this is the top ISO for utmost quality. If you set ISO to AUTO it will top out at ISO 400 regardless of the conditions. However, if you set ISO to Intelligent ISO then it will go above ISO 400 and you can set a limit for how much over ISO 400. Color is natural and not overly saturated, although this can be adjusted to your liking.While I like the camera I must point out a major negative...........The review above is based on my second camera. The first camera had to be returned, because it had a very noticeable magenta shift in color rendition. It literally could not render silver or blue as their respective colors and instead would render them as purple.  If you look up reviews for Panasonic cameras you will find various persons that mention this as an issue. However, the second camera has performed perfectly in terms of color rendition and has so far rendered all color accurately in all lighting I have used it in. Perhaps this is quality control issue...I don't know.Lastly, I came very close to ordering the Canon S95 (especially during it's recent Gold Box day). It is more pocket friendly than the LX5, however already having numerous other cameras and access to a Canon Elph 300hs, I could not justify investing in the Canon with the unknown risk of the \"Lens Error\" problem. Search this issue and look at the Amazon reviews and you will see it is more of a problem than you might think. I have personal experience with this since a simple P&S; Canon used at work died for the same reason with very little use.  With the LX5 one can further protect the lens and the retracting mechanism by using the lens adapter and a filter. It makes the camera bigger but it protects the investment.

The DSLR was just too bulky and a pain to drag along on family outings. However, we wanted quality shots during these outings and the ability to get excellent quality shots and RAW was desired. So, for the most part, a point and shoot was out of the question. But then came the LX5. Just the right set of options and a reasonable size to carry around no matter what the occasion. I don't think I will or could slip this in my shirt or pants pockets, but a small carry case or neck harness allows us to carry it anywhere. And we are overwhelmed by the quality of shots this small package takes. Crisp, clear, and quality! Even in low-light situations. Video quality is great too. It's easy to use. And the options are endless. I will say that manual and RAW is the way to go rather then the automatic settings. It takes this camera to its full potential. But automatic settings will get you by to start with, and you will be pleased with those results too. Only negatives for this camera so far are the shoulder harness/strap that came with it (not very substantial) and the lens cap (why not have a built-in mechanism?). But we are happy nonetheless.

It was an outside afternoon affair in early August, so hopefully, available light would be a viable option (it ended up raining, so the ceremony and reception took place under a tent--much darker than I anticipated). I've since purchased a Metz 50 AF-1 and ALZO Digital Flip Flash bracket, but at the time, all I had was the relatively anemic on-camera flash (which I preferred to not use).I can't say enough about the pictures I was able to capture with this camera. I love the minimalist approach to photography the camera encourages--no fussing with removable lenses (or having to lug all that stuff around)--for wedding candids (the kind I like to take, anyway), it'd be hard to find anything better.Rather than posting more images showing how sharp the lens is (and it is a beautiful, fast lens), I'm intentionally uploading photos taken in low light--ISO up to 1600, handheld as slow as 1/4 second--with wedding photography, it's not just about razor sharpness (at least it wasn't with this couple--they loved the pictures). So yes, there's noise (the higher the ISO, the more noise). But these are images I otherwise wouldn't have been able to capture (direct flash would TOTALLY change the mood of the pictures). Noise or not, they come very close to what I remember seeing.I really, really like this camera.I also got the DMW-LVF1 live viewfinder (great little gadget, more than adequate for when I can't see the LCD on a bright sunny day) and (from another vendor) the Panasonic leather camera case (pricey but high quality).I'd buy it again in a heartbeat (actually, I may buy a second for a backup if I start doing weddings again, which I very well may).", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Thing", "Author": "Heath1", "ReviewID": "RFEHULIYAEDCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to review this camera because I'm so fond of it.  I did a lot of 35mm photography years ago and then purchased a Canon A620 digital that I wanted to upgrade.  I went through magazines and read all the comments on the cameras I was interested in - thanks Amazon.  I was looking for quality without bulk.My general thinking is if you need a strong telephoto or a camera that easily fits you pocket this probably isn't for you.  As an all-purpose tool though it's just great.  The metal body, made in Japan has that old-world craftsmanship, the speed and quality of the lens impresses me.  I enjoy the ability to take most any picture without a flash.  It has all sorts of capabilities as mentioned by others.  I purchased the SDHC 16 GB additional memory which has plenty of space and a Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag.  I don't see any need for a spare battery unless you plan to be away from electricity (recharging) for days at a time.  I do still use the Canon software which I'm used to for organizing pictures.  I haven't worked with the RAW editing to comment on that.  I also found the companion book \"Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5 by A. White helpful.

I've owned a bunch of higher end digital point and shoots (Ricoh GR Digital, GRD II, Sigma DP1, DP1x) and while they all have great, fun features, they all suffer from too much noise when you go above 200 ISO.  Sure, you can process the noise but with a sensor this size you really can't afford to give up much detail.  With its incredible number of options I was surprised how easy the camera is to use (fortunate, as the missing manual on the DVD isn't great, especially in its description of some of the \"intelligent\" features).  The displays are clever and very well thought out.Turning to the image quality, it seems as good as you can get in a camera this size.  The LX5 does seem to be a little better at dealing with high contrast scenes than other comparable cameras.  Other than that, it's quite good up to ISO 200 but to my eye, things go south pretty quick at 400 and above.  Yes, it's the price you pay for something this light and small but let's not kid ourselves about the limitations of tiny sensors.  If you can live with ISO 200 or just don't want to carry anything bigger, this is the one to get, for now at least.  The lens is also quite good for a zoom that goes from wide angle to short telephoto.  Not surprisingly, stopping down helps a lot, especially at the 24mm end.I've noticed an interesting phenomenon.  People love checking out the LX5.  The LCD looks cool and you can show them cool stuff like the stitching overlay.  If it's possible to like using a camera a bit more than  the results it produces, put me in that category.With so many people complaining bitterly about the lens cap, I figure I'm entitled to something equally silly.  The battery charger displays a green light when you first start charging.  This light goes out when charging is complete but this has to be the only charger I've ever seen where green means \"not ready\".So, depending on what you are comparing it to, and what you are willing to carry, the LX5 can be anything from the best camera you've ever owned to a camera that's good to have when you just want to have a camera with you.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the very best...", "Author": "Steve N", "ReviewID": "RLKGRZRIX8LXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned/used many of the higher end 10+ megapixel cameras.....G10, G11, G12, S90, S95, HX5V, and TL500.

Amazon was only 5 days too late for my schedule (sorry guy's) so I paid top dollar.  Anyway, this camera has a trillion features - most I'm still learning and I can't stop using it.  I put my TZ5 in the handbag as a backup but never grabbed it once in 21 days.  The LX5 has a cool manual over-ride and the ability to take filters and a supper flash.  I have gotten  great shots - but the camera is so complicated that every now and again I get all out of synch and a few action pics are way blurry - kind of trippy but also goofy.  The zoom isn't as cool as the TZ5 but the clarity of wide open terrain is spectacular.  With the right settings, Europe's finest churches are able to be captured in vivid clarity of color, sharpness and pure magnificence.  It took a week to get a handle on a few features - but my wife said it is cause I'm getting older.

We found it in the Lumix DMC-LX5.Note: It shoots 720p HD video. The included software lets you upload to YouTube in HD, easy! Converting to mpeg to view on another PC failed, no audio.

The control buttons and dials are easily accessible and having macro/aspect sliders around the lens work nicely.Picture quality is excellent and having control over specific settings (A/S/M/ISO) really helps bring out the potential this camera presents you. Limiting the ISO to 800 while shooting in low light situations helps keep noise down to acceptable levels. Applying a small amount of Noise Reduction in Lightroom brings the quality of low light pictures up quite easily.The Color Modes are fun and Scene Mode is great for beginners to choose specific types of pictures they will run into.Great camera with the only thing I would have changed is the lens cap.

I've had other digital cameras and I was always disappointed with the way the photos looked flat (no depth of field) and with low-light performance (I prefer natural light to flash so that people and places look more natural). So these two items were main considerations for me. This camera does really well with both. The lens is great - is easy to throw the background out of focus and have sharp focus on the subject, giving pictures the depth I used to get with my film SLR. I take photos without flash all the time and they look great, so I'm VERY happy with it. Of course, I have to stay very still, but several friends have commented about how good my pictures look without flash.The lens also has a wider angle, and there are several format size options, so the pictures I took at holiday parties all look very cool because they capture more of the scene and the focus is very sharp.The only downside is that the zoom is pretty short, but I wanted a compact camera and this is a trade-off I made to be able to carry the camera in my jacket pocket.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Point & Shoot", "Author": "Jimmy Lin", "ReviewID": "R1JAD0WT1SUCZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a semi-pro who spends a lot of time with DSLRs, I wanted a compact P&S; camera for walking around whose image quality would hold up to my standards.  I started by looking at the Leicas and found that a few Leica models were identical to certain Panasonic cameras, just with different firmware.Panasonic's Lumix LX5 is the same build as Leica's D-LUX 5, for a few hundred dollars less.  The camera feels great in the hand, solid with a nice heft without being heavy.  Not the tiniest camera - but one that is comfortable for walking around with.There are a number of preset options - but one of the main selling points is the flexibility to go beyond the presets.  In this, the LX5 is an outstanding product - all of the settings that I am used to having quick access to on a DLSR are similarly accessible on the LX5.Image quality at lower ISO's (400 and below) is outstanding, rivaling that of the Canon 5D Mark II with an L lens.  Over ISO 400, images become progressively noisier, as expected.  The flash helps somewhat in low-light conditions, but its range is very limited.  If you plan on frequent shooting in low light, you'll want to opt for a separate flash unit.However, in good lighting conditions, the images come out amazing.  Colors are rich and saturated and focus is tack sharp.  High-def video is similarly impressive, although with one caveat - with high-contrast bright spots (say, a spotlight on a stage, or a sunspots off of water), you will see purple streaking.  This is a problem that is difficult to correct - I have tried several combinations of filters, lens hoods, etc., and none of them have worked satisfactorily.  This is NOT a problem limited to the LX5 - all CCD cameras have this shortcoming.Otherwise, this is a fine camera.  Battery life lasts forever - I videoed a couple of two-hour burlesque shows and only used roughly 75% of the battery.Excellent camera when used under the right conditions.

I have no quarrel with the colors that the .jpgs from this camera produce. The screen is bright and colorful. I had seen some comments about all of these things and was a little worried, but no longer. No complaints. Love the camera. It is a bit large for a pocket, and I kept mine mostly hanging from my neck in a soft case. I had no problems with the lens cover; it has a little string to keep it attached to the camera and works fine. By contrast, the automatic iris lens cover on both my G7 and SD 870 have had to go back to Canon for repairs. The separate lens cover is one reason I bought the camera. The menus are easy to navigate and provide numerous useful options. I definitely like the manual pop-up flash as compared to the S95's automatic pop-up.Speaking of Canon's S95, my friend brought one on the trip and was in awe of the Lumix when we reviewed pictures at night. They both take great pictures; each has slightly different strengths and weaknesses. I was a bit jealous of the S95's compactness and convenience. One thing at which the LX5 seems to excel is macro and food photography. In my opinion it is much easier to do this well with the LX5 than with the S95. I filmed numerous flowers, product labels, and dishes of Chinese food. Both of these cameras take great photos at night; if you get one, be sure to try it at night for street photography without flash.In summary, I'm completely satisfied with this camera.

We already have an FZ28 so we were in no real hurry.We set our sights early-on, on the LX5 and considered the LX7. Other cameras like the Canon S100 & S110, we felt, couldn't hold a candle to the LX'ses'. The only camera that made us pause was the amazing Sony RX100. However, the RX100 was beyond our budget.Initially the LX5 sold for about $350, the LX7 closer to $500. Then, as the shopping season approached, prices began to drop, eventually the LX5 hit $250. The LX7 was selling at about $300.After some consideration we got the LX5. It had a longer track record than the LX7, and the quite sudden $200 price drop of the LX7 scared us a little. Also some accessories like the automatic lens cap were not available for the LX7.In hindsight we should have gone with the LX7. It may not be \"better\" than the LX5 but It does have a CMOS sensor and longer zoom.Nevertheless both cameras were incredible value.

I have a 20d that takes incredible pictures obviously but the processor from 2006 or so is showing its age with especially low light situations.  I won't get rid of it though because in daylight and with some good cheap Canon lens, it is still incredible.But I wanted something smaller and when I got the LX5 I was amazed.  I also received another cool camera awhile back in the Canon G12.  It's been fun comparing the two.  I like them both for various reasons.  The G12 reminds me of a loaded small SUV by BMW or Lexus.  The LX5 is more like a Mazda Miata.Simply, the movable LCD screen is a cool G12 feature.  LX5 doesn't have it.  The viewfinder I bought extra for the LX5 is better than the miniscule, blurry viewfinder on the G12.There is a longer zoom on the G12 and this is useful like when I wanted to blow up something from a considerable distance.The LX5 does Macro photography unbelievably better than the G12.  My wife and I did multiple tests of this on flowers and such in the yard.  The processor on the LX5 guesses in auto mode better than the G12 across the board.  So if you want to work in the less space of a 90mm zoom as opposed to a 130mm zoom, go with the LX5.I'm not getting rid of either.  You can't go wrong with either one of them.  The LX5 is slimmer and is cheaper, but then with the price drop finally of the G12, and the fact you have to pay 135 dollars for the EVF of the LX5, they are both priced pretty close.I'm not, at this time, interested in similar 4/3 with interchangeable lens.

The colors are rich but exposure and brightness need some adjustments. The zoom is not that great but sufficient enough. I also noticed that quality of pictures is reduced with a higher zoom. It takes camera longer to focus at a higher zoom level. The night pictures came out great with little or no noise. ISO levels could be adjusted to 12800.

Over all, I would give it 4.5 stars.I've bought a Case Logic QPB-202 for it, now I carry it with me everywhere and nobody notices...I've turned off all the sounds so it's totally silent so I can use it in church, in restaurant, in concert, you name it, very convenient.UPDATES:I've just bought a Nikon AN-CP19 Replacement Strap for my LX5, good quality, works for me perfectly.I've found that JPEGs out of box are looking good (sometimes the color is on the cold side), but RAW files's DR looks better to me, besides I have more control of it, so I shoot only RAW now as I do with my K-x.I hope this helps a bit, good luck!", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera.", "Author": "mdculpepepr", "ReviewID": "R379EGG0D0XOGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.It works great as a \"point and shoot\" camera.But the real benefit of this camera is in its manual settings, which there are many.If you are an experienced 35mm SLR photographer and want to unclutter your camera bag - this camera will be a good choice.If you are a point-and-shoot photographer and want to up-grade to a better quality camera with lots of manual features this is a good camera.The lens has good range and the quality is very good.The flash is decent.For my travel photos, I did buy the lens adapter so I could use a few of my 52mm filters.I bought a spare battery and a 64gb SD memory card and a very small tripod.I use a small camera bag and in it is the camera, the lens adapter, 3 filters, tripod, spare battery and the charger.I also on occasion use a compact slave flash and a wide angle lens for specialty shots.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ergonomics not so good", "Author": "Andy Madone", "ReviewID": "R2IURZ24C5840A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With all else said already I must call attention to the poor controls and handling of this camera.

From best to worst:The standout feature of this camera is the video. The first day I took some handheld video of my little girl doing homework and focused in on her face. This was while we were in the car. The camera automatically smoothed out the zoom and the video quality rivals easily the Canon T2i that I have. For the average joe this camera will work great as a simple video camera. I plan on using this to record some short interview snippets at work instead of setting up a traditional video camera.Picture quality on macros is awesome. Might not be as good as DSLR but DSLR is too much for my needs.A great travel camera. This camera fits in a pocket or small bag easily. So far the battery life is fine too comparable with other small digitals. Love the charger, which doesn't have a detachable cord you have to worry about but is pint-sized and just plugs right into an outlet.Regular picture quality is pretty good. Did a family photo shoot with my kids snapping pictures with this while I used my T2i and a lot of the shots we will end up using came from this camera. Great color, easy intelligent focus, simple to use.Cons:1. Low light is not great. Wouldn't buy this if that is a big deal for you.2. The lens cap, which you take off before turning on the camera, is a minor annoyance. The XZ1 has a cool feature where the cap automatically falls off and is caught by the tether.

I was attracted by two things initially: that beautiful wide aperture Leica lens ... and HD video.I've used the camera on several trips - skiing in the Rockies, hiking in the Arizona mountains, a NYC trip, and a beach trip. It has been an exceptional camera. The instant access HD (lite) video is surprisingly good and you have full exposure control and AF in video mode. Creative controls are fairly intuitive and really flexible, although the manual aperture control is a little tricky to use. Still at f2 you get really nice selective focus. Not quite as narrow as a comparable DSLR f2 but still nice. For a compact, it's an excellent lens with a surprisingly wide focal length - really useful in so many situations.The aspect ratio control on the lens barrel is pretty sweet. Took me awhile to understand the situational uses for it but depending on subject and ultimate output, it helps you maximize end image quality.The pop-up flash is fine but nothing special. Then again, it has a hot shoe and doesn't look or feel ungainly with a small external flash mounted. Impressive!Ergonomics are nice. It feels good to hold and there's no question where your hands should be.The LCD is big and sharp. In manual mode the focus assist is nice. Slow! But nice.Using the shoulder strap, you can walk around all day with this camera around your neck and not really even notice it.Shutter lag is, like every compact I've used, still there, but it's not terrible. I haven't used it for true sports shooting because I count on my DSLR for that. But it does have a mode for it so I'll give it a shot.Overall, this Lumix DMC-LX5 is everything they say. Great lens.

Wide Angle + Low Light + HD Video = LX5.", "Author": "Kebs", "ReviewID": "R32VB5F8NVX45T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'd like to thank all the other reviewers here who have helped me make a decision. After spending nearly 3 weeks searching for that \"perfect\" camera, I decided on buying LX5. There are some really excellent technical reviews here. So I'll try and refrain from those but instead share my experience that helped me make that final push.I am an amateur photographer. I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT (that I bought in 2004), a Tamron 28-75, and a Canon HG10 HD camcorder. Recently, I bought a zoom lens that I always wanted. But then, they were all too bulky to carry them everywhere. So I thought it would be better to get a P&S; that I'd carry with my zoom and keep the other two home. So I started looking for a camera that had it all - Excellent image quality, features, HD video, etc. While certainly there exists no such ideal camera today, I started looking for my closest match.My three basic requirements were wide-angle, low-light performance and excellent video quality. And I couldn't be happier with my decision.I had considered Canon ELPH 500HS, Canon PowerShot S95, Sony WX9 etc. and did not even knew about LX5 in the first week of my search. While they all have excellent IQ and some of them with nice features such as Full HD, touch screen, miniature mode etc., none of these or others fit all the 3 requirements that I had. S95 came very close and I spent one whole week deciding between those two primarily because of S95's smaller size. But that was before I had held LX5. While not the smallest in the lineup, LX5 certainly is not bulky and I am easily able to slide it in my jeans front pockets.1. Wide-angle is fantastic - After using Tamron 28-75 for so many years, I have found a whole new dimension in wide-angle photo-framing using LX5.2. Low-light performance is terrific - I have several handheld nighttime shots that would envy a tripod-mount with very low noise.3. 720p HD video is amazing. In fact this is one of the biggest reasons I bought LX5. I have had two friends, on different occasions, ask me what camera did I use to shoot the videos. They never asked me before when we saw videos that were shot with my HG10 :)While I would have liked the fancier features in Canon/Sony, I realize that on a packed vacation trip, usually it is very difficult to use those features. But don't be fooled. The LX5 itself is loaded with a whole array of similar features and more. Knowing that and the fact that it is EXTREMELY configurable in terms of manual settings for both photo and video, I have the peace of mind when shooting. It's a different story, that I don't use them and prefer to shoot with its I.A. (Intelligent Assist) mode all the time :) and that's because it is intelligent indeed. Moreover, the startup time is very quick, and point + lock + click is extremely fast too.The packaging comes with two straps: a thin strap for the lens cap, and big neck strap for the camera but I don't use the neck strap since it takes out the portability. I bought a small hand strap instead.Finally, the battery life on this camera is superb. On my recent trip, I constantly shot about 400+ photos and 30+ videos (30 sec - 1 min) in one charge. (This was with immediately shutting off the camera after the photo was taken and no review thereafter.)5 stars all the way.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing little gem!

About 40% faster AF, which really shines in low light situations where the AF and CPU will acquire faces and your point of selection much faster.2.

This means I don't get the versatility or picture quality of the SLR.  I know that.  I've had a Lumix DMC TZ3 for years and it has given yeoman service over 4 continents and through some pretty brutal conditions.  It has never let me down.  Thus I wanted an upgrade to it, while staying small.  Hence the choice of the Lumix DMC-LX5.  Many of the controls are familiar, which helps a great deal.  The problem is that the LX5 is a far more versatile and sophisticated camera, and thus there's far more to know.  The instructions manual is pretty good.  You'll need to spend a couple of days pressing buttons, and even then, it may take a while.  This is the problem, not of the camera, but of a person who is not particularly techno-savvy or interested.  I love the wide aspect and the ability to choose aspect ratios.  There is also a clarity to the pictures that I never had on my old Lumix.  The camera seems to weigh about the same as my old one but it is a little larger in width and breadth, and a great deal larger in depth because the lens always sticks out about 1/2 inch.  I knew that before I purchased the camera, and decided that it was a compromise I could live with.  My guess is that this camera will be one I will come to love, once I am a bit more comfortable with it.

The LX5 isn't that much longer but every little bit helps. I also hated the snap on lens cap with the LX3 and found a auto lens cap online here at Amazon for only $22. Works like a charm but I had to figure out that it screwed on. You have to unscrew the ring in front then screw on the auto-lens cap. It's great! If you think you're gonna get amazing low light performance - forget it. A lot depends upon how low the light is. However, the low light performance is better than my Panny ZS7 which was F/3.3. I think with any camera you still have to use a tripod in order to get really good results. You can get fairly decent photos indoors with strong ambient lights without using a tripod but it will also boost the ISO and ISO levels above 400 - 600 tend to get grainy. I supppose there is no perfect point and shoot camera but so far, this seems to be the best one on the market. I shoot architectural for a living with Nikon D700 and a 14-24mm lens and even with that camera indoors I use a tripod. I may look into the flash for the Panny in order to bounce it. I hate direct flash. I think the biggest issue for p&s; cameras is direct flash. Whoever comes up with a camera with a built-in flash that will diffuse and/or bounce will have a LOT of buyers!!

I prefer the Lumix over the others because, for me, it produces high quality photos more consistantly than the others, particulary indoors.  In the case of the canons and the sony, as long as the auto focus and exposure performs the sharpness is probably better. But both the sony and the canons seem to produce shots out of focus or improperly exposed more frequently than the Lumix (again, while in auto mode).  I know many people that will disagree with this assessment, but it has simply been my experience.  I particularly like the way the lx5 handles flash up close.  The other cameras have a tendancy to over expose and blow out the detail.  Some that love the sony or canon tell me that I just don't know how to make the proper adjustments, which may be the case.

There are vertical purple blocks due to lighting.  Do a little research and you will see this is a common problem.  I'm not sure if Panasonic address this issue yet.-The automatic setting is more often than not overexposed.  I always have to reduce the exposure or focus on the sky rather than the subject.  The most annoying part though is every time I turn the camera off and back on, I have to repeat this step just to shoot using \"intelligent auto.\"  The LX3 actually remembers your last used setting and keeps it there.  The LX5 resets the exposure back to zero which is a huge pain.  The intelligent auto doesn't feel auto when I constantly have to adjust the exposure.-Bulky.  I knew this from the get-go but eventually I realized it would have been nicer to just get a smaller camera that can do almost the same stuff.  Instead, I have to pull this out of my backpack or have it hung around my neck constantly.- My thumb wheel eventually stopped working.  This is also a common problem.  I'm not sure why mine in particular stopped working since I didn't open it up, but one user said Panasonic found a little bit of dust/sand which voids the warranty.  If you think about it, the grippy wheels will always be rotating dirt/oil/dust from your finger or gloves and rotating them INTO the camera.  Of course there will be debris found behind the wheel.  This is a poor design.- Shooting at high ISO is extremely grainy.  Then again, most point and shoot cameras suffer from this so I won't really dock down a star for this.- Shooting on really fast burst mode is also grainy.So what I'm left with is a camera that I'm pretty much stuck with shooting on auto and scene settings (since the thumb wheel refuses to work, manual/shutter mode is useless).  To make matters worst, the auto setting is more often than not over exposed.  If I try to aim at the sky to fix this issue, it is often underexposed.

The TZ5 has a longer zoom range (10X), but in every other way, the LX5 is superior. The LX5 menu system is familiar, but the addition of extra controls around the base of the lens actually makes it easier to use than its predecessors, while offering far more control -- quite an accomplishment. Low light performance and video quality are unbelievably improved. Under perfect lighting conditions, the TZ5 was a good basic point and shoot travel camera, but the LX5 takes far better pictures under a wider range of conditions. It offers simplicity for the novice/casual photographer through its intelligent auto mode, while providing a multitude of controls for the advanced photographer who wants more control over the process. This is truly a remarkable balance, and I suspect that I will be keeping this camera longer than 4 years.NB: Two \"must-have\" accessories should be factored into the purchase cost of a LX5:1) Auto lens cap: JJC ALC-5 Auto Lens Cap for Panasonic DMC-LX5 & Leica D-LUX52) Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX5: Getting the Most from Panasonic's Advanced Digital Camera. The PDF guide that comes with the Lumix LX5 is not unusually badly written, but in a camera with so many features, it offers very little useful help, with a focus on identifying controls, but without detailed explanation of what they do, or why one would use them.UPDATE: Impressions from my first long trip with this camera, 3 weeks in Alaska: I have mapped the exposure bracketing setting to the 6 o'clock button on the jog dial. Whenever I'm shooting in difficult lighting conditions, especially outdoors with strong light, I like to bracket exposures; +-1/3 EV is usually enough. Although this camera generally does a very good job of nailing the exposure, it can be fooled. Bracketing means more photos, of course, and the battery is up to the job, as I've been able to take far more than 300 photos without recharging.

I looked around for lighter/smaller cameras that did not give horrible compact style pictures - washed out, blurry kids with spot light flash effect.  I narrowed it down to the GF-1 with a 50mm equivalent lens, but the price eventually rose to near $900 which did not make sense for me when you can buy the new Nikon D5100 for the same with much better performance, but won't fit in your pocket.  Anyway, I looked then at the high end compacts and settled on the Lumix lx5.It may be unfair to compare the photos to my four years old 5D purchased used on ebay, but that is my reference as a 'down grader' wanting something small and light.  I love the autofocus tracking.  This is huge for moving children and the one feature I enjoy the most.  It is present on many of the new dslrs now, just not on my 5D.  The interface is nice, and you still have the P,A,T,M modes.  I find the camera is more sensitive to the bright sky moderately reducing contrast.  I have the adapter tube attached and plan to experiment with a polarizer.  The focus is good, but the lens is not as sharp as my cheap 50mm prime.  If you stay at ISO 400 or less, you will not be saddened by noise.  Zoom is nice but you need to realize anything under 35 mm will distort an image's near far relationship creating large noses - this is the same for all lenses, not a fault of the camera.That being said, I find many of the 4\"x6\" or 5\"x7\" images pleasing.  My wife looks at her photos and says how much she likes her camera.  So for her, I'd say it is 4 stars, for me 3 stars.

Other than this, I own a Sony DSC-HX9V and a Sony SLT-A55 DSLR.  The LX-5 takes excellent pictures in bright light.  The pictures are very sharp! However, I got this camera strictly for its 'low light capability'.  Unfortunately, it brought back memories of my Panasonic FZ100...the bad memories.Even in a brightly lit mall, I could see the all-too-familiar yellow blobs in the shadows.  Those yellow blobs are very hard to get rid of.  I know all too well with the pictures of the FZ100 which I owned for almost 2 years. I've spent hours with photoshop to get them out and I'll end up with soft pictures which look ok only when resized much smaller.  The FZ100 ruined most of the indoor faily pictures when we went on a cruise.On the plus side, the LX5 has super fast focusing speed and start-up times.  Compared to the HX9V, its super fast in start-up and changing menus.  The hx9v also focuses very quickly and locks on.  This camera, even with the 3 stabilization modes (Auto, mode1 and mode2), the pictures can get shaky.  However, I found the flash recharging between shots almost the same in both the cameras.  but with a f/2.0  who needs flash right?  But, the LCD display is misleading.  I would focus the camera on a dark bedroom and it would actually look brighter on the LCD (of which BTW, I cannot reduce brightness).  I snap the picture and it looks bright and clean.  But when I look up the picture on the computer, the picture is darker than it showed up on the LCD!And people are complaining about losing the cap, I think they are failing to notice the tiny black thread that's included in a white bag stuck behind the cables bag.  Nowadays cameras like the HX9V are pocketable with a 20x lens and a camera with a 3x lens cannot have an inbuilt shutter?This will probably be my last panasonic camera.  I'm done with those yellow blobs.  Yeah, the hx9v might not produce sharp pictures indoors, but at least, I don't have tons of yellow blobs staring me in the face.  I can apply some sharpening, brightness and noise reduction, I'll have a usable picture.  And oh, the hx9v produces excellent sharp pictures in bright light.  I mean which camera nowadays doesn't?

Lappasi \"omonk\"", "ReviewID": "R7QHY4YB8SSCK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got a LX5 today and the time I have spent with it is one day.  A bit of my background: I have owned numerous point and shoot in the past (at which time I almost always used the auto/P mode and may be changed ISO settings at the most, and was more interested in the video capabilities of cameras).  I purchased a SX40 a couple of weeks back and after a good amount of getting used to the ISO/f-stops/aperture/shutter speeds/depth of fields etc, it revived my interest in cameras and good photos, especially low light photography.  Now I shoot manual or Tv (shutter) almost all the time.  With this new interest, I wanted a pocket-able \"take it anywhere\" high performer.  And hence this LX5 purchase after seeing nothing but praise for it.  My primary needs are indoor (night light) shots of the never-remaining-still 3 year old.Now the pros and cons of the LX5 (in some sense based on comparing it to my SX40; and on my expectation of what it should have been for it's steep price; and also keeping in mind the results from so many other 'over the counter' point and shoots I have owned).----------The good----------+ Super fast focus.  The SX40 on the other hand does drift all over the place for focus sometimes.+ Medium benefit: Multiple custom C1/C2 modes (I did not use it on the LX5, but have realized that it is very handy to have them).+ Minor: Play button to toggle b/w shoot/review which is nice.  Most panasonics I have owned before have a mechanical switch for play/shoot.  Some of the older panasonics even had the review as one of the positions on the dial which was even worse.+ The shutter lag spec is 310 ms - which I think is good.  I felt it to be reasonably quick in that department as well.  May be I \"felt\" so because I knew the spec a priori.---------The bad---------- Very noisy; low light shooting is much poorer than expected.  I thought the F/2.0-3.3 lens would help a lot here and keep my shutter times lower, but it has been a disappointment.  I am comparing it to my SX40 which I got a couple of weeks back.  I have to say that after witnessing the performance of this LX5, I am very very satisfied with my SX40's high ISO / low noise results.  Canon has done a really good job (has to be some excellent algorithms and the new Digic processor since the sensor size of the SX40 is a small 1/2.3\").  May be this is also because the LX5 has a CCD sensor and a 2 year older technology.- Medium: Only 2 or 10 sec preset timer options.  For tripod shots to avoid shake, 2 is a bit too quick, 10 is eternity. I am spoiled by the canon custom mode where I have a custom 4 second timer (on the canon you can also specify the number of shots which is nice).- Minor gripe: Has a mechanical thumb wheel to change shutter/aperture values, instead of a up/down button.  It is a bit cumbersome to use.- Minor gripe: Lens cap; prefer a built in lens cap for smaller cameras.- Minor gripe: The exposure correctness dial will be displayed only when you half press the shutter, so you have to half press, change settings as needed and then shoot again, whereas the SX40 shows the scale all the time.---------The only tangible benefit I noted was the fast auto-focus.  The rest as you can see are miscellaneous.  I am assuming the movie/video mode must be quite good since that has been my experience with panasonics in the past (I have always felt the videos are much better in the panasonics, and casios compared to the canons, at-least in the low end point and shoots).  But I never got to or even want to test the video since I am quite content with the videos from my Samsung galaxy.If you are looking for a low light pocket size miracle like I did, I suggest you get something else may be a four thirds.  As of now, I refuse to enter the DSLR world for it's sheer bulk.  I considered the XZ-1, but the video format being Motion JPEG on that became a deal breaker.  By the way, the LX5 is not really very \"pocket-able\".  It is perfectly fine for coat/jacket pockets, and loose jeans but not so much so if you wear correct fitting pants :)I never used/tested it in broad daylight yet, and I do not intend to (even cell phone camera results can be quite acceptable in good light).", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect back up camera at current price", "Author": "Vinylspinner", "ReviewID": "R1GVEJJA5YHJW7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are situations when DSLR will draw too much attention and ruin candid camera opportunity.Also, when the opportunity strikes, having a pocket camera with you beats having D800 in hotel room.

I shoot with a Nikon D300 and own a cadre of high end lenses.  I purchased the Lumix primarily from the reviews as well as some tinkering with one in a very good photo store in Denver.  I was impressed with the overall build of the camera, albeit, it is much smaller and requires some getting use to when handling.  My main purpose for purchasing it was to have a pocket ready camera to take with me on business trips when lugging the 25 lbs, of Nikon equipment didn't seem necessary.When I received it was was very impressed with the diversity of the controls, the Leica f 2.0 lens, zoom range, handling and quality of photos that came out of a relatively small sensor. I like the fact that I can shoot raw, which I do most often with my D300.  I did use the high resolution jpg setting with a 8-GB card and got some nice shots that had the potential to elevate themselves to an 8z10 print with low noise not to much loss in quality.  During my testing, however, I did experience a magenta tinge on the right side of the photo which only occurred randomly. I have heard reports of a greenish tinge appearing and don't know if this is a sensor related issue. From the reviews that I have seen, it seems that shooting raw will alleviate this matter but I don't want to be relegated to post processing if I don't feel the need.  I do feel that this camera has a great deal going for it and I will definitely try again with a new one.At this writing I have returned the camera for a replacement and hope that I don't experience this again. The one thing that I have rated the shipper poorly on is the packing, or lack of it, that I have experienced.  The original camera came to me rattling around in an over sized box with no packing material.

I replaced it with a Panasonic GF-1 that while I really like the camera - it is just to big to be my compact (primary is a 5D2). I plan on selling the GF-1 to pay for it's replacement. That was to be the LX5, G12, S95 or TL500/EX1. I tried the LX5 first and frankly - am quite disappointed.Pros:1. 24mm f/2 Wide Angle - love it.2. Love the aspect ratio switch that ISN'T just cropping the main 4:3 aspect ratio. The 16:9 24MM angle of view is very impressive - my favorite thing about the camera by far. I originally went with this over the S95 strictly for the 24mm FOV and it is great after seeing it.3. 3FPS while shooting raw is pretty cool.4. Zoom/AF during video is also very nice.5. Hotshoe - definitely a must have and the primary reason it got picked over a S90/5.6. Battery life is pretty good - another reason it got picked over S90/5.Cons:1. When composing - the camera quadruples the pixels on the back screen - so only after you take the photo is the 460K dot screen actually utilized. This is a huge drawback and makes a camera that came out last week feel dreadfully dated in use.2. Image quality is really just ok - my G11 was way better. I shoot raw exclusively - and I have to use Lightroom's noise reduction even when shot at ISO 80 to get creamy soft skys.3. As stated the screen above isn't 460K all the time - but I also didn't realize how much I loved the swivel screen of the G11.4. Video quality is ok - but I don't want to fire up iMovie every time I want to dump stuff off a card - wish it was a self contained file like the h.264 out of Canon.5. Menu system feels like a 1999 camera - very dated and disorganized.6. Build quality feels just ok - the G11 or TL500 are both built like tanks - this just doesn't have that feel.7. The lens cap is crap and adds too much thickness - I much prefer the G11/S95's automatic cap.8. When you turn the camera off after taking photos in succession or a video (where the buffer is used) - the lens doesn't retract immediately. You have to wait for the camera to finish writing to the card before you can put that dreadful lenscap back on. I bought a faster memory card and that did improve it - but I never had this problem with my G11.Really I suppose what I want just isn't here yet.

So far, so good ... I've not upgraded to CS5 or Lightroom upgrades so I can't judge as yet the RAW files which is all I prefer to shoot.  So, for the jpeg images: Excellent exposures, well balanced colors/saturation ~ mildly 'soft' focus which does concern me - again, I haven't tinkered with settings or evaluated files in the RAW stage.  Composition with the wide lens is outstanding and the 3.5 times zoom is truly enough for me and a camera for these purposes.  Size is good, nice fit in the hand and not too bulky or heavy - this is compact.  My main disappointment at this stage is the finish of the WHITE version I bought ... very cheap looking - shiny pearlized white ... looks more like a Lexus paint job for a car than a camera.  White is my favorite color and I waited extra time to purchase it in white, but if I had to do it over again, the BLACK would win hands down .. too bad they didn't continue with the previous silver color option as on the LX3.  I'm close to sending it back for black but I kinda like the idea if I see a white camera walking away it might be mine and easy to spot :)  I won't can't evaluate the video so many of you are interested in as I would never buy a camera for video purposes ... actually, if they could charge a hundred dollars less and leave it off I'd prefer it.

Consider Canon S95 .", "Author": "Mark A. Bajek", "ReviewID": "R5SMI12089KGW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I normally shoot canon point and shoots but after laying waste to three of them over 5 years, I decided to give panasonic a try.  And I really want to like this camera.I use them primarily as a backup to Nikon DSLRs while walking around or to shoot over my steering wheel or out a window while driving blindfolded and drinking coffee. (just kidding , I've given up coffee).I've used most recently Sd 800, A720, and S90's for this purpose.  The S90 if it's actually working correctly can take a pretty good snap.  Even the A720 shoots pretty well in available light and it seems more balanced than the panasonic. (but they're both not really pocket cams).  The A 720 works surprisingly well one handed in decent light while at 70 mph.  I wish the lenses were more sealed against the elements, but they're not....so in high winds like I sometimes shoot things (dust) can sometimes..ruin a little camera.So my 720 after 10000 shots has sensor issues, and my s 90  even after being repaired by canon continues to have intermittant focus issues and can now only focus at 24. (but I mostly shoot it wide anyway)..So just before leaving for a long 7200 mile road trip I bought a panasonic as a walk about camera and maybe shoot it while driving (but that cap issue is a real drawback). It has decent specs, decent reviews and it's not too too big ...yeah it is..too big. too heavy,cap is annoying as heck..It's a heavy little guy. certainly not as pocketable as an s90/95 and it seems at least at night, not to shoot as reliably as the S90. and not having an integrated cap? at this price level? means, you're using a case of some sort. It's not in your pant pocket. It's strapped to your neck or in a case on your belt....not nearly as available as an S90/95.  Not nearly as concealed.It does feel substantial and with both the s90/95 and panasonic transfer cold from metal to skin fast. (wear thin gloves in 20 or below weather or you're hands will get cold really fast).The Panasonic certainly doesn't work well at all while driving....I'm not sure if it's the bulk , or the weight to one side while holding it while driving with the other hand. It just doesn't work well.  You've got to take off the cap, power it up, and shoot.  With the canon's, you just power it up....point it out the window at 100 mph and fire away. No real worry about the cap...no excessive wind resistance, not any more so than holding your hand palm up out the window, the panasonic....just handles differently one handed.  I might just have to practice more one handed with it, popping off the cap , blindly one handed., but you can hold an S90 or A series canon out the window of a moving car with one hand and not really fear dropping it. and fire it with a finger on your left hand or your thumb or finger on your right depending on which hand you're shooting with.  The panasonic not so much.... and it's probably button placement to weight ratio with one hand issue with my tiny little hands.  It's a special application use that it fails miserably at. Score one for Canon.The picture quality seems OK in daylight to dusk, night it's a bit less capable hand held than the Canon 90 in very dark situations.  I don't know why yet , I've only shot under 3000 pictures  and haven't really inspected the shots that well. But the canon seem less grainly for shots taken of the same subject at similar settings.(yeah I carry at least two cameras at all times while walking around, maybe three, thank goodness for cargo shorts.) I made the mistake with the panasonic of shooting a series of dusk after sunset shots at 1600 hand held, and it's a bit too grainy over 800.  Usable maybe at 1600 but pretty grainy.As is the S90.  But the S90 seems to take a more stable picture at a lower ISO even as low as 80 compared to the Panasonic....and it's really easy to change settings on the Canon via the rings.  the panasonic isn't hard...but the Canon seems easier. You don't have to look at the display as often or maybe its a twist of the rings on the canons vs. to a sequence of button presses on the panasonic that make the difference in handling feel better leaning toward the Canon S90/95.I can almost reliably be sitting in my car at a traffic light at an intersection and snap a half way decent shot at night on the s90 at 80-100 iso thru an car open window. Yet the panasonic for some reason and it might just be the way I hold the two cameras, even if I'm standing on the street with the panasonic at 800  the canon seems to best it at 200 , maybe the stabilization systems are different,. Could be I'm moving a tad bit more with the panasonic balancing differently. IF I have enough time to get the shot off with the panasonic while at a light...it doesn't seem to do as well.It's nice that it shoots wider 24 v 28. and can zoom kinda far. but if I'm missing shots? due to camera operational time lag 4 mm means nothing. It's still is missed shot.And I do like some aspects of the panasonic's handling.  But I think it's gonna be a second place finisher to a new  now discontinued replacement s 95 to my now 28mm only S90.  . (even with all the little problems users report).  The S100 seems to get dim fast after 28mm. But it might be worth looking at too for the extra 100 smackers considering I do sometimes forget just where I took a particular shot. (gps) and maybe it can shoot more reliably and with less noise in low light.  The other CMOS Canon I own the SD4000 is a royal piece of kit....couldn't shoot it's way out of a wet paper bag ......just a waste .

The noise is acceptable when using ISO 100 and 80, but in ISO 200 and above noise is very obvious even viewed in PC screen, shrink to fit view. It has more grains than my ancient Kodak Z7590 in full-size, but after manual resized the picture to 5MP using lanczos, the noise level is no worse. So if you want to view it on a computer or print the photo no bigger than 5', then set ISO to 100 and you'll be fine.Don't set ISO to auto or 200 and higher, or you'll get pictures that has massive grains in RAW mode and are much blurred in jpeg mode, especially in low light environment.My previous work involved programming with Canon G2, G10, G11 and G12. All but G12 have much worse image quality than LX5, but G12 has slightly better noise performance and also slightly better color range in RAW (but not in jpeg, Panasonic does better jpeg post-process). Since I bought this camera as my own P&S; camera with my D3X, api and sdk is never a factor, plus I care jpeg performance more and I don't like the complicate handle of Canon so I chose LX5.2) Dark corners are very obvious when aperture is wide open. This is visible in RAW but concealed in jpeg. If you want RAW output and light condition permits, try not use 1/2.0 but 1/2.8 and slower.3) Lens cap design really s**ks. You can easily lose it and when you find out that, the lens has already been scratched, just like my friend just did.

Vincent", "ReviewID": "R3R4SPFD9OS3LW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace a Canon SD1000 that I purchased nearly 5 years ago.  Nearly 50% of my photos are taken inside my house of my dogs, wife, etc.  With the Canon I had issues with the white balance and the sensitivity.  Many of my pictures would come out orangeish and grainy.  I upgraded to the DMC-LX5 to alleviate this, the large sensor (bigger than the S100 which I was also looking at) as well as the f 2.0 lens made this look to be the perfect camera for these shots.Now, just to break from that line of thought, when I was looking for the right camera for this job I saw so many posts on camera forums with people asking for the miracle point and shoot.  Something that is good for children / animals and fast movement in low light.  Responses invariably involved suggestions of a DSLR.  The point being that this type of shooting is difficult for the average point and shoot camera.  Well, when I want into this my Canon could shoot in my house with only some extra grain and white balance issues.  With the upgrade I wasn't looking for perfection, only something better.So, back to my experience.  When the DMC-LX5 arrived it was mid-day on a Saturday.  Photo's inside the house were great, the video was smooth.  I really liked what I was getting into.  Then as the shadows became longer I continued taking shots, mostly in the Intelligent Auto mode which worked well.  But around dusk, I was ending up with more blurry images.  Spoiled by my last point and shoot things like aperture speed and ISO have fallen from my mind so I had to read the manual, the manual on the CD, and start looking up information online.  Over the remainder of the night Saturday and the night on Sunday I took quite a few pictures.  Adjusting everything that the camera offered.  Using different scene modes, ISO settings, shutter speeds, taking photos in RAW, tweaking them on the computer end...And after all of this, I still ended up with blurry photos.  I thought that I was being hard on the LX5, expecting too much.  So I turned on my treadmill and set it to the lowest speed, 0.5 mph and threw a sneaker on the treadmill.  Then I started the side by side test, using an ISO of 800 which is fairly clear I took photos of this shoe moving past with the LX5 and with the 1000SD.  In nearly every case the LX5 either gave a unusable dark image or a blurry mess.  Meanwhile the 1000SD consistently gave very noisy images but they were still not that bad, you could see the sneaker and it was reasonably bright.I posted one of these photos in the shared area.  Still, I don't know why this occurred.  I contacted Panasonic and they put me through the usual steps but it was repetitive to what I had already been doing, I only called because I was worried that I had a defective camera. I don't know if the image processing is just a little more geared toward those types of shots in the SD1000 or what but I just couldn't live with using the LX5 for the type of shooting that I do.  Still, at comparable ISO and shutter settings it always gave a brighter image than the SD1000 it's just the issue with movement of the subject.  So, back to the drawing board for me.  It just looked so good by the numbers...Think I'm going to get a Sony NEX and get it over with.  I did love the camera body, and the customization was awesome.

I wanted an every day carry around camera. I don't expect it to replace my Nikon system. If a situation calls for a big boy lens I'm gon'na bring the big boy box. With that said there were two choices that I was interested in (my personal choices) the Canon S95 and the Panasonic LX-5. I wanted low light without flash photography and HD video. End quality is everything. I had an Olympus 1030SW and it was an awesome workhorse, but the image quality was less than I hoped for. And the main reason I purchased it was the weather proofing ie: water. The first time I got it seriously wet it failed, permanently! It seams I failed to read the fine print in my owners manual that said my camera had to be serviced by the factory once a year at a cost of $39 to ensure it stayed waterproof. My Bad!! Ok so my only complaint with the LX-5 is that you have to have Photoshop CS5 to process it's raw files. Sorry Panasonic your software works but it's not Photoshop. I wasn't planning the photoshop upgrade until I upgraded my computer system first. But I have to have my RAW files. The only knock on the Canon S95 were the dials were easily bumped changing the settings. It's built really tight my 6' 4\" 200lb frame had a little problem operating the lens ring and rear thumb wheel at the same time. The LX-5 had just enough meat to it to be comfortable. And the image quality is superb. Mind you I am not trying to replace my Nikon system with something smaller.

The LX5 was really the smallest camera with the most amount of outstanding features for video/stills. Once you got smaller than the LX5, you started to compromise.The Canon S95/S100 are amazing, but their video capabilities have been disappointing as you don't get full manual control over Aperture/ISO/Shutter/Exposure/Focus in video mode at the same time.  The LX5 gives you manual control over everything in video mode. For me, it's better to have 720p with full manual control over 1080p and no manual control.The Sony HX9V's video quality blows every P&S; out of the water, but it's mostly automatic control and as a stills camera, it's average. The LX5 beats it as an overall stills/video package.I just got the Olympus XZ-1 and while the stills are fantastic, the video quality is probably the worst in any P&S.; It's shockingly awful: soft, muddy, grainy -- awful for the price.I want a P&S; with the best video/stills capabilities for manual control. Manual control in video is especially important to me. SO, I have been debating whether or not I should buy the LX5 again after going through most of the competition this year OR if I should wait until the next LX5 model comes out.I'm not loosing sleep over this, but I'm just annoying that camera technology improves by the month and there are so many P&S; cameras to choose from, yet there are only a handful that stand out and of those handful, each has compromises for the manual control enthusiast.

The 2.0 lens just is not that big a deal when you can jack the ISO anytime you want and it won't blow out the background in any case as it is too wide.  Then came the 24mm crisis.  I rarely shoot at 24mm but that is where this camera starts when you turn it on.  I found that the first thing I was doing was getting the lens down to 28mm to 35mm, a step that I did not always have time for.  In other words it was not ready to shoot right out of the box (pocket?).  Don't get me wrong, 24mm is wonderful sometimes but if the subject is not right then 24mm is a handicap.  I did love the 90mm top end however so I was reluctant to give the camera up, but I did.I am now making peace with a Canon G11 which I like very much even though it is bigger and does not do pockets even a little bit (and is no where near as cool looking).

Primarily, every picture I took with this camera in RAW, I said to myself afterward afterward, \"I wish I had just taken my D300 with me instead.\"2. Everyone, including yours truly, is seduced by the notion the LX5 and its counterparts are great walking around cameras that can shoot RAW and offer a number of other important options, not the least of which are manual control and a fast lens. While it is true one can walk around with this camera stuffed in a shirt pocket as opposed to any DSLR, it is still somewhat more bulky than real compacts especially with its lens and cap. A camera bag over the shoulder or a camera with strap slung around the neck is not going to be as comfortable, but if one is concerned primarily with imagery and its qualities, shirt pockets come in a distant second. In other words, see number 1 above.3. The images from this camera can easily be printed at a large size, but they cannot in any way compare to those from a larger sensor. The lens has a limited zoom range, too, which makes it less optimal than some of its competitors. I noticed far too much noise even at ISO 200 when shooting in lower light. I was stunned by this result.  I also think the color saturation is too intense though shooting in RAW provides options.In the end, to spend nearly $500 on a camera that is inferior in most regards to its bigger brethren isn't worth it to me. I would get a less expensive compact camera and use it for snapshots and less demanding images. I'd take the savings and put them toward a DSLR or lens that in the end will yield far better results. BTW, I have successfully printed files from an old Canon Powershot 850 at 18X13\" inches with great satisfaction. That camera cannot match the LX5 for control, but when I want real control I use my D300.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ok camera, much better choices available", "Author": "David E.

Truth be told, I was slightly disappointed with its performance, especially in low light. But most importantly, I think this camera falls into a strange middle ground where personally, I found it rather annoying to carry around.  This camera is too bulky to carry in your pocket.  Its big, its heavy, and it looks awkward and awful if you were to put it into your pocket because its so thick.  At first I didn't think this would bother but turns out I was wrong. It bothered me a lot. If you're going to carry this camera around that you can't fit into your pocket (I guess it would fit into a purse if you're a woman) you may as well lug around your SLR.  The whole point of a point-and-shoot camera is so you can comfortably have it on you all the time.  I found that I NEVER carried this camera with me.  Next is the lens cap. A lens cap?! On a point-and-shoot?! Really?!  The lens cap is extremely annoying.  You want to be able to turn on your camera and have it ready to go at a moments' notice.  You don't want to have to fumble about putting the lens cap on and off. Its gets super annoying within the first 5 minutes of owning the camera. Things like a hot-shoe for flashes and stuff, just seem ridiculous to me on a point-and-shoot camera.  If you're going to be carrying around a small camera, that you cant fit into your pocket, and a big flash unit, you may as well bring your dSLR. The whole point of a point-and-shoot is so you DON'T have to carry your dSLR with you everywhere you go.  So you can just pull it out of your pocket if you're say at a club, driving along and see something interesting along the side of the road, or just get a flash of inspiration while you're at work, etc.  I sold this camera and am getting something smaller and more nonsensical.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "build quality not good. replacement also failed", "Author": "Daniel R.

There are several differences you should be aware of:1) The LX3 lens/filter adapter, and any 46mm filter, is not usable on the LX5. Panasonic changed the filter thread to 52mm.2) The LX5 scroll wheel is not an improvement on the LX3 joystick. I don't have large hands, but the LX5 scroll wheel is recessed and difficult to push unless you use a fingernail.3) On the LX3, exposure compensation is a dedicated button on the 4-way controller and you change aperture (or shutter speed) setting with the joystick.  LX5 exposure compensation and aperture are only accessible by pushing the scroll wheel once or twice.  These settings require more button presses with the LX5 implementation. Although there is an assignable Function key on the LX5 4-way controller, you can't assign it to exposure compensation.4) On the LX3, exposure bracketing is accessible through the exposure compensation screen.  On the LX5, bracketing is only available through a separate menu item.5) The labels printed on the LX5 4-way controller keys are barely legible.6) The LX3 came with a full printed manual; the LX5 does not.Bottom line, I've returned the LX5 and am keeping my LX3.

The camera is not easy to hold for large hands. Setup menus also are not intuitive for a Nikon user. In fact there are two menu buttons. The one that is not clear, in the middle of the \"flower\" is the one that is needed for the main set up. When you call tech support first level they do not know this camera at all and for 45 minutes had me on multiple holds with the most annoying music before they came back on and then just hung up.  Once I dialed back and got thru to actual Lumix support, however, they were courteous, helpful and good. Hopefully the pictures will come out as well. To be continued...Jan. 20, 2011 - Have had it a few weeks now and took it skiing last weekend. It did a great job! I need an eye view and this camera has a well designed add-on viewer with diopter adjustment. Perfect, but now I need a larger case because it is tedious and time consuming to have to assemble and disassemble the eye viewer. The connect for the add-on uses the flash shoe and a socket right below. It feels a little fragile but does flip up, a nice touch. The camera design has 2 menu buttons on the back. The main menu is the center of the flower but only noted in extremely light type. On-going, the battery use time is the weakest point. It is rated for 200 shots and it's doubtful it could make that. Need to carry a couple of spares, totally different from Nikons which seem to shoot forever. The instruction download is not as clear as it could be regarding the menus. As stated above the initial tech support was not good. Very important to penetrate thru the people who initially answer to those who actually know Lumix cameras. Once I got there, they were fine and very helpful. My initial rating was 2 stars due to tech support and also the instructions that don't come with the camera. Once you learn the camera tho, it is worth 4 stars and with a couple of tweaks could see 5! Very nice design and picture performance, the prime reason we buy after all. This is my second recent small camera. I tried the Nikon P7000 before this one, but it was too slow and had a weird RAW setting.

When you set the camera to 1X the lens is extended almost all the way out and hits the scope eyepiece.  In this setting there is total vignetting.  When you zoom to 2 X the lens retracts and I can slide the adapter down and vignetting is better but not gone.  When I zoom to 3.5X the lens extends again and pushes on the eyepiece so I have to leave the adapter loose to prevent a fault from the camera.  At this setting there is no vignetting.

This camera has a lot of great qualities, and as the rating indicates many people are happy with it.  My main complaint is the high level of noise even at low ISOs.  I looked at all the images from a recent trip and there was a LOT of noise at ISOs between 200-400 which should be well within the abilities of a $3-400 camera.  From what i hear it's due to a 5-7yr old sensor... the same used in the lx3.  It has a lot more control than the basic P&S; canon but so what if that doesn't amount to better quality images (in my experience).  I did also try a Canon s90 for a few months about a year ago and had the same complaints.  About 1/2 the images I got from the s90 were amazing... the other half very very noisy with terrible blown out highlights.  The lx5 is better (but not great) about preventing blown out highlights, but created less \"keepers\" than the s90.  Maybe I expect too much from this class of camera but I don't think so.  Clean noise free images in daylight with ISOs between 100-400 shouldn't be difficult for these cameras.  At the end of the day I honestly can say i didn't think it took better pictures or 720p video than my Canon 780 IS... and for the money I decided to stick with my cheap, highly pocketable and impressive (for the $125) Canon 780IS.Other negatives:  No 1080p video (in this day and age? for that price? really?), It's a bit bulky to keep in your front pocket but it's possible, horrible sun flares in video mode, menu navigation takes a bit of getting used to (not a biggie), popup flash can be blocked by your finger, lens cap design (would rather it be a built in cover so you don't have to remember where you put it at all times).Positive qualities:  Good in low light (but often bad in daylight), Excellent build quality, design, zoom in video mode, dedicated video button, great low light performance, looks awesome.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "best looking pocket camera", "Author": "Hogoc", "ReviewID": "R1FSQVUKRDU88M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After trying Canon, Olympus, Sony camera, this is my 2nd Panasonic Lumix camera.I bought it before the Hong Kong Electronics Show, and lots of people look at my camera and ask which one it is, you can tell it attracted lots of people just by the look.I love this camera not because all the feature and quality but it is good looking (just like iPhone and iPad - it is looking good.)", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best choice of compact manual Digital cameras", "Author": "Photography lover", "ReviewID": "R1XQVC5MED8QU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Try the best reviewed compact cameras with manual and raw file capable before making your choice because they compete with each other closely.

However, I am not satisfied for the following reasons:1. The Leica lens is very sharp and fast. I love the f/2.0 aperture. However, as stated in the title of this review, a good lens by itself does not make good pictures... The electronics and the hardware just do not do justice for this lens. Too bad!2. The jpeg engine in this camera is pretty lousy. raw is clearly sharper than jpeg for the same pictures. To add to the insult, one cannot select raw format when the camera is in full auto \"i.something\" picture taking mode. Only jpeg is available there...3. The full auto \"i.something\" picture mode is pretty stupid and does not make full use of the fast lens. Even in decent light, it often selects ISO of 400, 800 etc... resulting in grainy and noisy pictures for what would otherwise be really nice pictures if a larger aperture is used in connection with a lower ISO number setting.4. The auto face recognition autofocus often locks onto the wrong face/object in the frame, causing great irritation/inconvenience at best and lost picture taking opportunities at worse. Note that the full auto \"i.something\" mode does not allow for center focusing, and one would be at full mercy of this lousy auto face recognition monster.5. The mode selection dial and the zoom lever decided to quit working suddenly one day in the middle of a photoshoot. They both became sticky, like molasses. The zoom lever in particular does not \"spring\" back to the center as normal but rather sticks at the zooming locations, causing the lens to continually zoom.6. The picture aspect ratio selector switch is a joke. It allows one to select the picture aspect ratios of 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.... But one can always change the picture ratios or crop them in one's favorite photoshop software. To add to insult, the selector slider is in a place where it could easily be moved by accident. Just give me the aspect ratio of the full sensor frame and let me crop later, thank you very much.7. No indication on the camera when the macro focus is activated. This caused me to walk around taking pictures all-day on macro focus when I accidentally hit the focus mode selector slider and hit macro focus.8. Somehow, subject's faces almost always come out to be slightly soft and off-colored a little compared to other objects like clothing, hair, etc... Skin tone just looks weird.9. Data writes to the SDHC card seemed to take a long time. I have a class 10 SDHC card, formatted by this exact camera, and it frequently took 4-5 seconds at times before I could take another picture.So the search for a high-quality compact point and shoot continues for me.

I switched from my 7 year old Sony DSV1 since I felt it was really slow, especially when I had to use flash (long recovery time) and I kept missing the best moments trying to shoot my active 1 year old son.  I also wanted something with a better video quality.So far, I must say I'm not too impressed with the camera.  I'm satisfied enough with the quality of the photos, but it hasn't floored me compared to my old Sony.  Here are my impressions:Pro:1) It is a nice looking camera.  I got the white version.  It is traditional looking but fashionable.  I was afraid that it would feel too big, but it wasn't for me -- but I wasn't looking for a camera to put in my pocket either.2) HD video quality is amazing, but since I mostly upload videos online, I decided to use the .mov format most of the time.Con:1) Even in auto-flash mode, the flash doesn't automatically pop up; I need to manually open it with a button.  This slows down shooting.2) I realized that in automatic/program modes, I cannot force flash easily.  The only options that are readily available are auto flash (when the flash is open) or off (when flash is closed).  In order to get it to force flash, red eye reduction or other flash modes, I need to get into menu options, 5-6 pages down, and get into flash menu and select that option.  Of course, if I'm on a move shooting my son or traveling and happen to see a nice scene, but back lit etc., I don't have that much time to be scrolling through the menus. I ended up using a couple of custom settings to save various flash settings, but it feels very odd that that they don't give more flash options in a user-friendly way.3) It isn't that fast.  It takes a while for the camera to set exposure/focus.  It often takes 2-4 seconds to adjust focus and exposure.  It has happened indoors in reasonably lit conditions with regular lighting.  It seems like if I know I'd be shooting in one room for a while I have to use the AE lock so shooting would be quicker after the first photo - feels like I shouldn't have to do that  - frustrating.4) In the movie mode, there's a significant lag (1-2 seconds) between when I press the shutter button to when it starts shooting.  Again, it seems like it's taking time to focus.5) When I use flash in macro mode (or maybe just close to the subject - slightly less than a foot), it give a ring of a dark area (where flash does not reach) in the lower right corner of the picture.  I'm shooting using 4:3 ratio.  Is it impossible to make flash reach the corner of this ratio format when you're too close?  I thought it's because of the lense cover that I bought separately that's blocking the flash so I took that off and tested it.  It is better, but there is still a dark area (thinner than with the cap, like a line) in the bottom right corner.  I was using 3:2 when I tested.6) The macro mode (as well as AF/MF modes) selection is on the lense dial.  Not as bad as other \"con\"s listed here, but I find it inconvenient, since I have to take my eyes off the viewer/screen to adjust it (whereas my old Sony or Canon had it in the back panel where I could quickly adjust using my thumb while looking through the viewer, my finger on the shutter button ready to shoot).I'm not sure if I got a lemon (flash in macro mode, slowness adjusting, etc.) or I'm missing some more convenient control options that the camera has available.  If I'm missing something, I'd appreciate someone letting me know.  If it seems like I got a lemon, I'd like to know that too so I can return it.  Overall so far in terms of ease of use, I can't give this camera high marks.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "one problem", "Author": "John H.

I agree with some of the points others have in their high praise for this camera but no camera is perfect. This is my 4th Panasonic digital camera - ZS5, FZ35, GF1. I have been for the most part happy with them except for their low light capabilities which this camera is suppose to remedy.It has have a great field of view at 24 mm but the zoom does not even get you up to normal vision. You can get a converter telephoto and extension tube but that would throw this camera so far out of balance and would be bulky like an SLR.Its Raw mode really slows the camera down and at this point of time I have not found a program like photoshop to convert the Raws. Maybe Lightroom could do it. *** SEE UPDATE BELOW FOR RAW . I am sure the proprietary software could do it but I try and stay with more mainstream software.Its videos are typical for a point and shoot and you still get those bars of light from the sun and street lights that are typical of the CCD sensor. But one thing you don't get with the CCD that you get with the CMOS sensors is that Jello rolling shutter effect when panning.You have your choice of AVCHD or .Mov for easy editing which is nice feature. I like the position of the video dedicated button on top instead a thumb job on the back - just makes more sense. Although after taking AVCHD movies I could never find them in the camera. I went through file after file hidden somewhere. Final cut could not locate them in a download? A mystery.It is very small camera, big hands may find it too too small. Luckily there is a nice leather (maybe) simulated neck strap so it won't fly out of your hands on the ground as my ZS5 did once. Has a sort of useless flash over 9 feet.Clearly the low light capabilities, full manual controls, tiny size - not as small  as the S90 or 95 but smaller and lighter than the G10 or G11 , better battery life than the LX3 clarity of stills (2X), ease of operation, live view and 24 mm field of view may make you cross over from another point and shoot. To upgrade from a LX3 you should think about it. If you think you are going to get photos like a DSLR well I don't think we are there yet, but we are getting closer.PS One note - Many of the accessories from the LX3 are not usable on the LX5I will be returning this camera. I need a 15+ megapixel camera for large prints and little higher quality video. Just not what I expected maybe its for you  - not me.The clincher was in pixel peeping. Compared the Canon G10 to the LX5Maybe it was not fair because G10 was 15 MP the LX5 is 12MP but it was dramatic.The G10 was far greater in detail.If you are going to blow up areas within a photo Megapixels matter. If you are using it for on line posting or 4X5 prints the LX5 will be fine.Update*** RAW updateMACUPDATE HAS A FIX FOR NOWAdobe Negative Digital converter can convert until adobe comes out with its own forCS4[...]LX5 Raw converterCAMERA SUPPORT FOR PHOTOSHOP CS5 AND LIGHTROOM 3Camera Raw 6.2Mac OS Windows\u00aeLightroom 3.2 Mac OS Windows\u00ae[...]", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "CLeung", "ReviewID": "RWORQMGXUXWD4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to love this camera, givent the glowing trade reviews (Wired for example).

It is just to catch the attention of anyone who might be buying this camera right now, because there's an excessive cost, in my view, for an extra battery. The cheapest battery I have found for this camera costs 80 dollars. So I haven't bought a spare battery yet - I hope the price comes down! I've only found a couple of places that sell it - none on Amazon. And there don't seem to be any off-brand substitutes for the Panasonic version. This is problematical anyway, because I anticipate, from reading about the LX3, that off-brand batteries are not reliable with this camera line.Putting aside the battery cost, the camera seems to be pretty much what I was looking for. I bought this camera for my wife. It is way too much camera for her in many respects, but it has some advantages that aren't present in other compact cameras. Unfortunately, this means that the camera is about twice as big as I'd like it to be, but that's just an unfortunate tradeoff for the features I regard as advantages.The first advantage is a manual picture mode selection dial. This is the sort of thing that used to be the way you set the camera to capture scenery, portraits, etc. Unfortunately, there is a digital screen component to doing this, but at least one can start with making a manual selection.A second advantage is the wide angle lense. We are always taking pictures indoors, and most of them suffer from the lense not being sufficiently wide angle to get a good shot of all of the room. This one does. Add to that a mild telephoto zoom, almost 4X optical, and most of our needs are covered. Unfortunately, there's not any optical zoom which would allow for in camera framing of distance shots - ball games, etc. But that can be taken care of on the computer, given the 10 megapixels.One thing that I did not realize that this camera has is a manual switch to change the aspect ratio. Very nice.There are only a couple of things I'm not pleased with so far. One of them is that the battery compartment requires a manual switch to lock shut. In other words, it does not automatically click into place when the cover is shut, but requires that the lock be slid back into place. The second is that the still/video switch is a button placed close to the shutter/zoom button. This looks like an accident waiting to happen, but maybe that won't turn out to be a problem. And finally, the lens cap is not attached to the camera with a cord. Oddly, the cap has provision for one, but there's none in the box, & I don't see where it would be attached to the camera anyway.

I upgraded my Lightroom to 3.2, and it does not import the movie files. I tried installing the included software, thinking that it would see and install the movie files, but it will not install because my gateway netbook does not have enough resolution.

Unfortunately, the tube is 46mm on one end, and 45mm on the other, and both the camera and the accessories are 46mm. Another bummer.Third, I have been unsuccessful in finding a \"Panasonic approved battery\", as a spare, and was not able to find the leather camera case for sale anywhere.I have work-arounds for most of these issues, but in my mind, after shelling out more than $600 for the equipment, I should not have to resort to work-arounds.The camera itself rates 5 stars, but the frustrations pull it down to 4.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good camera with some strange limitations", "Author": "Frog G", "ReviewID": "R3DYD663S36M1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a sony A55, and bought this as a less conspicuous camera for everyday events (like preschool trips).

However, the pictures still look very good and perfectly usable, but there is visible difference if you do a side-by-side comparison.

I thought I won't need those unobvious features.  False.  Taking kid pictures means you want the ability to shoot continuously (not wait for seconds to take the next picture).
