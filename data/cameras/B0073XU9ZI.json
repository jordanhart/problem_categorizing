{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why is it so slow and sometimes dumb?", "Author": "MutAtuM", "ReviewID": "R170ZB40S27R5J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture quality is good, so long as you are not using the optical zoom. It becomes fuzzy and grainy with artifacts no matter the lighting. If zooming indoors in low light using the flash, it'll flash in on closer items leaving the subject dark and looking like it was taken using a very high ISO. Pressing the button halfway to get it to focus and meter sometimes does not work right. It'll suddenly become stupid and not focus in and sometimes will not take the picture making for a missed opportunity. Forget about taking a quick picture or many in succession with this camera, it's impossible. The internal software (firmware) is not good enough to handle what the potential of this camera is. All in all, it's okay for a fairly quick point and shoot pocket sized camera. For the money, it's not bad I guess. I just wish Kodak had taken better care in developing the firmware so it could work better. Sometimes it's very frustrating to own.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Kodak EasyShare C1550 16 MP 5x Optical/5x Digital Zoom HD Camera General Features: White color\n16 megapixel resolution Capture beautiful HD pictures in 16:9 format\nView your pictures in high definition on an HDTV or other HD devices 1/2.3-inch CCD Face Detection\nLens: 27 135 mm (35 mm equiv.)
