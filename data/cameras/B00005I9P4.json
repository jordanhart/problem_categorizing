It's not the best for either, but it is the best for both.  The reason is the floppy drive. I can take pictures for others, and hand them the floppy.  For personal use, you need to purchase an additional memory stick, otherwise you will be swapping floppys after every third or fourth high res picture.  The controls, and the view screen are very good.  The camera takes excellent pictures.  I also love the 15 secon video clips.  This a new option for me, and I love it.  I am slightly annoyed with the cycle time to take a second picture.  If you need a camera that can use floppy's, look no further.  If floppy's are not needed, keep looking.", "Date": "November 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Not so good for fast moving subjects", "Author": "H. Gatjens", "ReviewID": "RTHVBWCI3AUNZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a replacement for an FD91. I loved eveything about the FD91 except the need to carry a bunch of floppies around with me.This camera solves that with the memory stick option, yet still let's you use floppies for when you want to take a quick couple of shots and hand the pictures off to someone else.The only problem I have with it is that it uses a focus and exposure lock when the shutter release is pressed halfway. This doesn't work when you are following a moving object. By the time the camera is ready to fire the object has moved and is no longer in focus. I read the manual thoroughly and found no way to override this feature other than shifting to manual focus. The FD91 had a continuous focus system so this problem never occurred.If you don't shoot a lot of fast moving objects, this camera is superb. If you do, you will be dissatisfied.", "Date": "May 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "Haven't Found A Downside Yet", "Author": "Duane Monkres", "ReviewID": "R3DIAK6HIFQ20R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having shot at least 1000 pictures with my Mavica FD97, I have yet to find the downside. Features I especially like:  Optical 10X zoom. This optical zoom covers any situation I have encountered, from getting-up-close to the action while staying behind the fire lines, to getting close to a facial shot without distortion or intimidating the subject.  High resolution images. When coupled with a good printer, the resolution of the images shot at the highest available count renders a print that looks continuous-tone, even under a jeweler's loupe.  Ease of operation: Basic operations enabling great pix are quick to master. Advanced options aren't necessary to utilize in order to get the picture desired, but they are there, and I have yet to discover their full potential.", "Date": "September 28, 2002"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Camera", "Author": "Gregory H. Goeppner", "ReviewID": "R3J0SV4CQRXD81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow! This camera is so easy to master. Just follow the instructions. It takes the most amazing pictures. It's a little slow processing using floppys, and if you use high resolution settings, you only get 2 to 4 pics per floppy. If you're not interested in real high resolution pics, you can get 20 to 30 pics per floppy. Memory sticks are the way to go. They process quickly, and depending the size of the sticks used, you can get hundreds of high resolution pics per stick. Buy the Lexar Memory Sticks. They're a great product at a great price. Film will soon be a thing of the past. I highly recommend the FD97, and Lexar memory sticks.

Not going into a lot of detail, the first comment out of a supervisor's mouth was \"look at the blood glistening on the barb wire.\"  That says it all in picture quality.I will agree with one other person here who mentions the slowness in recording, especially with the memory stick. There is a problem taking pictures of active targets.  And the picture you get may actually be a millisecond later than you pressed the button - a lot of time for those kids to move around.Vacation shots are a dream come true.  And the zoom telephoto let's you crop your pictures before taking them.I get about 140 pictures using 1600 pix on the 128 memory stick. I recommend it five stars, my wife and I each own one now.", "Date": "December 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Memory Chip Slow", "Author": "Barbara Stodden", "ReviewID": "RRIAOHCH63UK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had my FD97 for a year now.  I bought it to replace my FD71 because I needed one that would give me pictures that would print out good 8 x 10s.  This one takes excellent pictures that print perfect 8 x 10s, which I need for my business.There are only a couple complaints I have about the camera, one is the slowness in recording, especially with the memory stick.  The other is the problem to taking pictures of babies or any child that might move before the camera decides to record once I press the button.  It is wonderful for stills, but misses a lot of otherwise good pictures of my grandchildren!", "Date": "November 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Looking back, A Really Good Camera", "Author": "Kurt", "ReviewID": "R197NGWC04FEZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since 2001 and it still takes great pictures (it's also nice to see the price (used) is close to what I paid for it new back then). The only drawback I'm now finding is uploading pictures to Windows Vista. Sony hasn't (at this point) made updated drivers available for this particular model, hence my Windows Vista-based laptop doesn't recognize the camera when attempting to upload images. Hopefully, this situation will be corrected over time, as it is a great camera for pretty much everything else.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R12FNPUEIZX6FF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow!
