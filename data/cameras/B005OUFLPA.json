{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Precisely what I waas looking for", "Author": "k1drbar \"Steven L\"", "ReviewID": "RAFB29XOW10DN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only nit I have about this product is the mount, it is rather flimsy and there are very few alternatives for installation.  I suspect many cameras like this one are mounted in a suspended position, my only choice was to us a mount point in the back of the package.When delivered the camera rattled, so I opened it up to find a small screw which was unattached.After installation I found this camera did exactly what I wanted it to do.  I have it so that I can see my mail box at the street, and now I have images that allow recognition of someone standing at that distance.  It also allows better recognition of vehicles parked at the curb or driving by.The IR LEDs create a brilliant night time image, in fact my other camera shows the illumination from the new camera as if someone left a bright porch light on.  I'm convinced that a \"bad guy\" coming up to the house at night would see those two dim lights on the house and know that they were being watched and decide to go elsewhere.", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Truly Amazing Cameras", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "RV40P0DBI2BPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Zmodo Surveillance ZMD-DC-SBN6-1TB stand alone DVR. I wanted higher quality cameras than what come with the sets.I bought three of these cameras to start off with.Hooked the DVR to a computer monitor, connected the wires to the camera, and sat the camera on the front porch. Instantly I could see my yard and the house across the street, plain as day. It has a beautiful clear colored picture. This camera is truly amazing.  Left it on and waited for the sun to set.The night vision is EXCELLENT.  I was mesmerized as I watched the leaves on the tree in the front yard blowing in the breeze. It was pretty. The camera even picks up the little moths flying around.  They look like little white balls of light \"whooshing\" by. It is pitch black outside but I can see everything in front of the camera. I saw the man across the street when he came out into his yard.  I can see the cars going by.  I can't see the drivers, but I can see the cars.  Sometimes the lights on the cars show up as red, sometimes as white. Anyone coming into my yard could be identified.The next day I threw one of the cables over the garage to the backyard and hooked up a camera back there. I just sat it near the ground.  Now I can see my chickens.  It is so nice.  I can sit here in my living room and watch my chickens. Again, at night I can see what is going on back there very plainly.  Tonight there was a cat another night there was a possum.Youtube has a man demonstrating the night vision of this camera.  That is what convinced me to buy it. You might want to look at that.  Just search for the camera number and you should find it.I really like these cameras so far!I bought the AWG24 cable wires for them, as one of the other reviewers recommended. I just have to get the cameras up on the house, wires through the attic and back down through the wall now. Have been watching youtube videos on how to do that too.  There are tools that help bring the wires down the walls.The DVR is capable of posting your pictures online so you can see them with your tablet, smart phone or other computer, you will need to bring the camera wires inside the house somehow and attach them to the DVR.  The DVR is then connected to your modem. I have chosen to bring them through the attic and down the wall into the living room.It gets a little complicated.  I still haven't figured it all out. What a great feature though, to be anywhere in the world and be able to access your DVR and see what is going on around your house!Also as someone mentioned the mounting brackets are pretty lame. Other than that, my only complaint is the narrow view. These cameras are made for long distances, not close up wide angles. That is okay though, I can add cheaper cameras with wider views to cover the blind spots. These are great cameras and I will purchase a few more.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but not great!", "Author": "preybird1", "ReviewID": "R3083HL96B145H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has better color quality than a 450 tvl camera but at night this camera really shines. It is like the sun is out at night. Very good night camera and more of a long range camera. Works better at 65' and farther up close like 65' and closer is not so good.

That is why I bought this model. I am monitoring a thief that lives 2 doors down from me. I can see the middle of the night activities without any light other than the IR that this camera offers. I did find that my particular camera has soft focus for about 10 to 15% of the left side. If I would have noticed sooner, I'd have sought a replacement. but I am happy with it as it is. I'm keeping it. Be sure to pay attention to the angle of view... make sure this camera will be wide enough of a view for the pictures/videos that you want coverage of. This camera has a 12mm lens which is like a medium to long telephoto lens on a regular (now ancient) film camera.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Clear picture but narrow field of vision", "Author": "William Covington", "ReviewID": "R1L6S9UK5WZXQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The day and night images are awesome.A very limited field of vision tho.Only use if you are wanting to focus on one particular area.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "now i see", "Author": "R.
