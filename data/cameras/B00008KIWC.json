This does not mean that this is a bottom of the line camera. It is a VERY good camera for any user ablility and age.The down side is that it is almost impossible to find the accessories for this camera. Fortunately mine came with the AC adapter and the case that actually goes to this camera. I have not seen either anywhere online. There is also an optional remote control for this camera but finding it has proven to be unlikely at this time.But still; overall a perfect camera for someone/anyone who does not want to take time to read a manual.", "Date": "January 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "MorningSciFi", "ReviewID": "R1K87JCX7K9THO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Digimax V4 (a slight variation of this camera) was by far one of the best overall digital cameras I'd seen when I was researching cameras to buy, and I'm very glad I purchased it.  The thing that made it stand out the most from other cameras was the battery usage.  I've heard of some digital cameras using their batteries really quickly, but the batteries in this camera can last me a full day of photo taking.  It can take several kinds of batteries, AA x 2, Lithium, and more.  When I come home after a full day of taking pictures and pull them up on the computer, they look so clear and beautiful-every time it seems my jaw drops, the quality is amazing.  Even a friend of mine who is very knowledgeable of cameras told me that he was stunned at the quality of the JPEGs I was showing him that I'd taken.  Not only that, but when you go to the max zoom (which makes use of the digital zoom, which technically just \"crops\" the picture and enlarges it), the picture still looks just as clear as the normal pictures that didn't make use of the zoom.Something that doesn't usually get mentioned is the lens company.  The lens company that makes this camera's lens is Schneider-Kreuznach, a company that's famous for its quality in lens making.  Because of this quality, this camera might possibly give you overall better looking pictures than a camera that has perhaps 5 Mega-Pixels.  This is a great buy for beginners and those who love taking quality pictures.  There's plenty of information about this camera all over the internet- this should definitely be considered if you're looking for a great camera at a reasonable price.", "Date": "June 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent little camera - same model as the V4", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R6OGQ2MXWV5O4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In case you were wondering, this is the same model as the V4 and it takes very sharp photos outside, and not as sharp inside w/flash, but still very good quality.  All this was done on \"easy mode\" so the photo quality gets even better when you manually select the finest quality.  I haven't ventured into that yet.  It's pocket-size and comfortable to hold.  I shopped extensively and researched comparable digitals, and Samsung seems to have put a lot of thought into this one and the price is very competitive, which was a big deciding factor for me.  For an amateur like myself, the easy mode works very well.  For an experienced photographer, there are many possibilities.  My original goal was to find a digital with a large LCD screen, however, I learned that the larger screen eats up batteries very quickly. This LCD is only the standard 1.5\", but the image is very sharp so you get a good idea of what the photo will look like.  I'm new to digital photography, so I cannot tell you how long the different types of batteries will last you.  I've read that the rechargeable li-ion batteries perform the best, and next to that would be the AA NiMh 2200 mah or higher.  But the best information I received was on a great website called \"Steve's Digicams\".  It was very helpful.  I do recommend this camera, but please keep in mind that I've only owned it for a few weeks, so I have not encountered any technical problems.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nice Looking Camera", "Author": "Richard Turner \"Zinger\"", "ReviewID": "R32RAG9NRF9FDY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the camera but I found out that there is a short some where in the camera and drains the battery fast and batterys are not cheap I've taking about 10 pictures and went through 3 batteries", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Battery Killer", "Author": "Keith N.

It seemed like we were buying a new pack of batteries every other day.  Granted she was taking hundreds of pictures as well as some audio recordings but it just seemed like the camera is an energy hog.  We are very pleased with the quality of pictures.  Downloading is very slow compared to my Sony camera.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera but battery eater", "Author": "C. Jesson \"photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R4WE5ZLD6WW70", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Canon Rebel SLR and another slightly smaller digital camera, but wanted something I could easily throw in my purse or pocket.  I just came back from a trip with this one and went through a lot of batteries without a lot of photos.  I had a large arsenal of batteries - regular alkaline, and two types of rechargeable NiMH batteries.  The low battery symbol would come on and off after only a few shots, then the camera would beep & the battery would go.  I was averaging less than 30 photos per set of batteries.  With my other digital camera (which takes 4 AA batteries) I would get 150, usually more without trying to conserve on viewing the ones I had taken.  It has a lot of features that most people won't use (most will use the easy button) - the manual is almost as thick as my digital SLR.  I had it on easy button & handed it to my 6 year old to take photos.  Forget about using the timer to get it the photo yourself- I could barely count to 6 before the shutter goes off (guess they want you to buy the optional remote control).  Also, a few times I found myself on movie mode by accident, so I can only guess it is easy to change it accidently. I did not try the software that comes with it as I always just use the card reader that plugs into my USB port and File Explorer to transfer my files.  I can then view them in Shutterfly or Ofoto programs and upload them to the photo printing and sharing service.  I tested the flash in a dark room & it seemed to work at close range, did not have the opportunity to try it any further than that as all my other photos were outdoors.It did a decent job of capturing a sunset from a moving car. All the other photos I took with it were in full sun. The photo quality was quite impressive for a camera that cost me $99, but it would bankrupt me if I was not using rechargeable batteries.  I am wondering if the weight I save in a smaller camera will be used up in bringing along extra batteries.  I would have given the camera 5 stars (for the money) if it wasn't for this critical issue.", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00008KIWC"}}
