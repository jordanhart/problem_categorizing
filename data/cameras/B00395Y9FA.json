{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera with a couple notable issues", "Author": "Jerald Wuorenmaa", "ReviewID": "R2OF0UZR0VFVK3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a 2007 model Lumix (LS-70) that broke due to water damage.  This model is more advanced in some areas (more megapixels and longer zoom) but less advanced in others (no optical image stabilization [OIS]).  It was the latter point that was my main misgiving upon ordering the F2, but the lack of OIS so far has not seemed to be an issue.  I am still able to take sharp ISO 80-100 photos indoors with the flash or reasonable ambient lighting.Overall, pictures from this camera are very good and of higher quality than my last Lumix.  Colors are fairly accurate as long as white balance is set correctly.  Barrel distortion at wide angle, one of my pet peeves, is minimal.  Noise is kept at an acceptable level from ISO 80 through 200.  (I have not bothered to test higher ISOs as I would probably not use them.)Sharpness is very good in the central part of the image, especially at wide angle (35 mm equivalent being a respectable 33 mm), and even at 100% resolution for 5-megapixel images (I have little need for the 10 MP setting).  However, moving out toward the edges, problems begin to appear.  Severe blurring affects the right upper and especially lower corners at wide angle and extends to a lesser extent along the edgebetween the corners.  Along the bottom right edge, blurring extends into at least a third of the image.This may seem like a minor point, but it is noticeable in certain textures even at a much reduced resolution (less than full screen size for 4:3 images on a 17\" widescreen monitor).  The best solution I can think of for this issue is to favor the upper left corner when framing the image, leaving the opportunity to crop out the right edge for a crystal clear and vivid image.  Blurring on the left side of the frame is minimal, and chromatic aberration does not present an obvious problem anywhere.Another issue I noticed right away is that the zoom control ring, which surrounds the shutter button, is flimsy and has a fair amount of play (not just in the ring itself, but back and forth movement of the entire ring/shutter button mechanism within the case), leading me to question its longeivity.  But Panasonic digital cameras are among the most reliable, so perhaps this fear is unwarranted.  At any rate, the zoom works fine in practice.Beyond the image concerns and the zoom lever, I love this camera.  It has an attractive appearance and lots of features including the ability to record widescreen VGA (WVGA) video.  Sound is provided for in videos, but HD resolution is not.  In still images, there is some opportunity for manual manipulation of camera settings including exposure compensation and ISO.  As for automatic settings such as Auto Scene Mode and Face Recognition, I have not used them yet but doubt they would play a role in my rating.  I will eventually get around to using specialized modes such as night scenery, though.  Finally, I have mixed feelings about the rechargeable battery.  All of my past cameras have taken AAs, which was nice in a pinch but also kind of a clunky system.I would hesitate to recommend this without qualifications due to the aforementioned issues, but based on my research and experience this camera has to be one of the best choices in the \"entry level\" price range.  I buy cameras at this level not because I am a beginner but because I don't have a lot of money to throw around, and so far I think it was a good choice.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera for Dummies!", "Author": "FoodDiva \"FoodDiva\"", "ReviewID": "RI450NNP008NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is sooooooo easy to use!  It took me about an hour of playing around with this camera to find all the features (and more) that would meet my needs.  The pictures come out so beautiful with just a simple press half way to focus and shoot!  I've purchased more expensive cameras that gave me less than beautiful pictures (probably due to user error), but this camera is MUST I emphasize VERY EASY TO USE!  I'm sure my other cameras could have done the same thing, but they were more complicated and I'm sure I messed up the settings by playing around with it.There is a scene mode that allows you to take pictures in different settings (parties, snow, aerial views, indoor, night sky, babies, pets, etc.)  There is also the normal shooting mode which allows you to shoot in color, black and white, sepia.There is the coolest feature (i found) where you could shoot in bursts with or without flash...meaning...you hold the shooting button down and it takes continuous photos...like one of those flip books...so you don't miss any moment!  I don't know if my other cameras had this function...if they did...I could not find it.I am very satisfied with this camera!  So 5 stars for ease of use, and great quality photos with simple and easy to use modes!", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Impressed with both photo & video quality", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R1Z3PQ8GMDCIT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already own a more expensive Lumix camera so I know the great quality cameras that Panasonic builds - but I didn't want to carry my other camera around in my bag on a daily basis, so this DMC-F2 fits the bill for me.It is not fair to compare the two so I will just say I am impressed with this  camera, even though it does not have OIS like my other Lumix (optical image stabilization - helps with camera shake).  Truthfully, so far I cannot tell the difference in most instances.  But if OIS is a must-have for you, for a little bit more this Panasonic Lumix would be a better choice Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH1 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black).Pros:>> Fast cycling - time between shots before it's ready again is about 1 second>> Takes good pictures, good contrast, although a little soft>> Burst mode - easy to change between one shot & burst mode via the quick menu button (lower right corner)>> Small & compact, but not too small that it's hard to grip, lightweight, easy to carry in your pocket if you want>> Black finish is matte, so it doesn't show fingerprints>> Lithium battery charges in less than 90 minutes and so far has not needed recharging and I've taken almost 275 pictures>> Movies are darn good for not being HDCons:>> Cheap plastic body, - the build quality is a little \"iffy\" for me - like the reviewer above who has the most helpful review votes, the entire zoom button moves back & forth, side to side in my camera also, like the hole was drilled too large, but it hasn't affected my ability to zoom in & out>> No optical image stabilization, most of the time it's not been an issue>> Not many manual controls, but you can't expect them at this price point>> Photo Fun Studio software isn't worth installing, Picasa is betterMovies!  I can't believe how great the video quality is, even though it's not HD.  I own a 3rd generation Flip MinoHD camcorder and this Panasonic camera takes better-looking videos.Movies are in the QuickTime format (software is included).I also want to note that you cannot zoom in/out while shooting a movie like most cameras of this price range.  But you can set the zoom before pressing the shutter to record.This camera uses a lithium battery, part number is CGA-S/106B, which is a 3.6V, 740 mAh 2.7Wh lithium-ion battery, in case you want a spare.  The battery is charged outside the camera in a separate included battery charger that plugs into the receptacle.This camera does have some internal memory, but on full 10 MP setting will only take 9 photos, so pick up an SD memory card.  I'm using a 4 GB Class 6 and this will hold 787 pictures at the 10 MP setting.This is a great case for this camera:  Lowepro Volta 20 Camera Case (Black)  Fits perfectly!", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice pics, but very fragile", "Author": "stella", "ReviewID": "R31OTUIX791P32", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were thrilled with the camera at first.  It took very nice pics and was easy to use.  However, after less than a month, the display went blank.  It still takes pics, but it is a blind point and shoot--Can't see the menu or anything that is needed to make selections either.  The unit was never dropped.  It was stored in an inside pocket of a purse.  It was working fine when it went in, but was blank when it was pulled out.  As I said, the purse wasn't dropped or anything; clearly the camera must of gotten knocked but there was no \"oh-oh, there goes the camera\" moment.

I'm no expert but the camera seems fine, I've gotten some good photos from it- most of the best ones in natural light. When light is low, either the camera is slow to shoot (without flash) or the flash (also a bit slow) washes out my subject's face and creates a slightly unnatural looking picture.
