I bought it and it arrives without the 300 zoom lens, tripod, and HDTV cable. After calling, they said they made a mistake in advertising and they were not going to honor the price. My options were to send everything back for a refund or take what they gave me. That would have been acceptable if....I had not spent the past 2 weeks shopping and comparing pricing online. I literally had to threaten to get the Attorney General's office involved and report them to the BBB before they decided to send the missing items. As they told me, \"We're doing you a favor\". Me a favor? What really annoyed me more than anything was I had a showcase sporting event for my son that I needed the zoom lens for. I asked if I could pay the addition for expedite shipping for the balance of my order and they would not agree. I even offered to use my own personal business FedEx account but was told no. I felt like the representative wanted to prove a point and would not cooperate as she expressed, \"We're losing a lot of money on this deal now.\" They shipped FedEx home delivery which took 7 days when if they would have put it on my account, I would have received in 2 and had a camera to use at my son game. I am now in the market for a couple of upgraded lenses and guess who's not on my list and won't get my money. Won't use them again.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my new camera", "Author": "Samantha Chiw", "ReviewID": "RLIKK5644FO8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for my husband (And myself..) for a birthday gift. We'd done a lot of research and decided that this was the model that we were going for. The price offered was phenomenal at under 700 including the shipping. The accessories are OK quality and will definitely do the trick until we require upgrades. DavisMAX made an error in shipping the first time around and left out some items but quickly fixed their error.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008EK0BZ2"}}
