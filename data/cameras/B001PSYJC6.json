The DVR battery is crap and only seems to last an hour before its dead. The DVR is very cheaply made and comes with hilarious engrish instructions. I like the fact you can power the camera with the dvr but it kills the battery that much quicker. If you want a good quality helmet cam look somewhere else.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Intresting System", "Author": "Kirk Baker \"Elmer Fudd\"", "ReviewID": "R2US3M2JGIDSB8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system has what is Needed to get the Video that is needed, but there are still some questions...Like can we use alturnative Power,what is the max gig's on  Chip Size ???For BMX you only want 40 minent run time but for Quad Touring, you want a full 8 hours, I mean I want as much as I can Get, that is why we edit...I might buy this system, but there is much research to do yet...However it dose look like a REALLY GOOD DEAL!!!", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001PSYJC6"}}
