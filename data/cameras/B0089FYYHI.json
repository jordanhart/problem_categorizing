I have been able to capture stunning images wiht it without any issues, iso is fantastic for its price and quality is outstanding, I have never had an issue with Nikon in the past and continue to be a long term customer of their products. only one issue i had was not with the camera, more with the seller. not huge just the fact that in the descriiption of the items included with the package it says \"25 free photo's, voucher included\" I didnt find them in the box that the items were shiped in. nonetheless  that wasnt why i bought there product. i purchased it because it was a Killer deal. the photos were just a bonus taht made no difference with me.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love Love Love it", "Author": "Katrinka G.", "ReviewID": "R3SSNHAOAMEBTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was great.

We looked at another camera, also from superfinds, which came with a 70-300mm sigma lens. It was $750, though. This one believe it or not came with everything pictured. the wide angle/HD lens (they are no bigger than my pointer *FYI*) are a great plus as is the flash motor.The camera is a great DSLR camera for those who haven't owned one before. The manual is very easy to understand and the circular dial on the body is not confusing at all. you just turn it to the mode you want it on and- boom! beautiful photo! It is great for action photos, portraits, macro photos, etc. while on Action mode, the camera takes about 70 photos per 2 seconds! Many reviews said that the camera bag would be moldy, but no, it was all in great shape.Even though we did end up buying a new lens, this is a great value! do not hesitate!", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nikon d3200", "Author": "John Coker", "ReviewID": "R1ML3PHWB46Z5S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera is really nice for the cost and takes excellent photos.

The camera is solid, takes great shots and has a breadth of potential for the amateur. I imagine it is of a caliber for those with more advanced needs and talents, but cannot speak to that.It is also fun!This package is ideal- lenses for your basic needs (a fisheye may be in my future . . . ), the auxiliary flash is perfect for capturing high-quality photos in a variety of lighting scenarios. I found the carrying case to be the right size, if a bit small. But at this point in photography, I am taking everything with me as I go, as I don't know what I will or will not need. I find the tripod to be beefy and sturdy. However, I carry two paperclips with me where I go, because, fully extended, under the weight of the camera, the top segment of the tripod leans. It is not significant enough for me to dock a star though.I have to say, this package arrived QUICK, well packaged and just as pictured.
