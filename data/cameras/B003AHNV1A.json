Especially on this item since it was only one negative review.  I based my purchase off of the same brand and other reviews and I understand you get what you pay for.  These worked perfectly as expected and I didnt loose any quality in the output of the cameras.I would suggest being careful with them while your running them, they are thin and if you try to stretch them, or get it caught on something while your running the cable you do run the risk of the cables not functioning correctly.  This is with any cables and yes the more expensive quality cables will hold up better to that one time abuse during the install, but as long as you dont abuse it you will be fine.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good at all", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R3FEU2CS2WCYJU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a 4 pack of these exact same cables because the price was right & their were plenty of stellar 5-star reviews...I purchased a CIB All-In-One Security system about a year ago (see my reviews) which came with cables which were thin, but OK. So I expected something similar when I bought these cables. When they arrived, I was a bit disappointed that they were thinner than the free cables I got with my CIB System. To give you an idea, these cables are thinner than the cable on my cheap computer mouse. But I figured they would be OK since the reviews were so good & that they would be easy to hide since they are so thin.Before I even unwound the cables, I plugged in a camera & power to each one to test them. The 1st cable had excessive static/interference, the 2nd cable had good video but the power did not work, the 3rd cable had no video, but the power worked & the 4th cable worked OK. I even tried each cable again with a different camera & power adapter to be sure the cables were the problem since I could not believe 3 out of 4 were bad.With 3 out of 4 cables being bad, I am just returning them & will look for something else. I would not buy these cables again even if they cost half of what I paid. The only positive thing I can say is that these cables came with BNC Female to RCA Male adapters.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.95", "Features": "2 X 100 feet video power cable for CCTV security cameras\nVideo and power all in one cable\nPlug and Play ready.
