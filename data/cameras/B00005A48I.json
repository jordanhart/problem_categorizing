{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Polaroid 2300Z Digital Camera is just right for me", "Author": "Carol C. Kladis", "ReviewID": "R2ROCI143ACKDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an upgrade to the Polaroid 1100 (my entry into the digital camera world.) The 1100 was just fine, but it didn't have an optical zoom, and I also wanted a bigger memory card.  The 2300 has an optical as well as a digital zoom, and an 8MB memory card, which is plenty for me.  It's a little more complicated than the 1100, but once you've got it down, everything becomes second nature.  The pictures look great, but if by some chance they need a little tweaking, the Photomax Pro software that comes with it can take care of any little imperfections.  It's very important to always remove the batteries when not in use, as these cameras soak them up fast. I also recommend Energizer Lithium AA batteries for longer life. And always use the AC power to upload.  Another recommendation: To enhance your photos, it can't hurt to have a couple other software programs to do the job.  I can still use the Photomax 3.0 that came with the 1100 (although you can't upload pictures to it directly from the 2300, but you can retrieve your photos from it). I also have Adobe Photo Deluxe, which came with my computer.  It seems if one can't do what I want, I just go to  one of the other programs. Another fun thing--I can connect to Polaroiddigital.com from the program and set up albums on their website for others to see and perhaps make prints of. Can't think of any downside right now, so I'll sign off.

It is designed and built by Pretec digital, a very reputable company.  The camera takes some of the clearest and best pictures I have ever seen.  And it is very easy to use, especially when compared to my old Sony digital camera.  [....]The only things I have to say negative about the camera is A) 8 mb is not a lot, so you'll need a new CFlash card [...] B) You'll need to buy NiMH batteries to extend the battery life (which is quite long due to an econmic design and an auto shut off) and [...] C)The camera is a bit heftier than others, in size and weight, but weight is related to a good build, a heavy camera is that much better.This camera is awesome, and the value is by far the best of any price or quality class, it's really unbelievable!  So if your looking for a good, solid, family digital camera on a budget, look no further than the 2300z!

Not to digress, but the sub-mega-pixel PDC 640 was a terrific little camera that was a favorite among my friends and family during festive get-togethers. My next camera would have some big shoes to fill.Let's start with the obvious benefits I now have from upgrading to the PDC 2300Z:The resolution is fantastic! 1792x1200 or 896x600 with 3 quality settings each. Even the lowest rez is higher than my PDC 640.Zoom! The 2X OPTICAL zoom is important. Sure it has a 2X digital as well, but Optical is where the money is.Incredible Battery Life! The ol' PDC 640 would eat a fully charged set of NiMH in about 30 to 60 shots. Now it's more like 60 to 90.More control! White balance and exposure (EV) settings give you more flexability with your shots.There ARE a few things that don't bode well however:Shutter response can be slow. By the time the flash goes off, the train has already left the station.Stuck with still life. Don't expect to get clear action shots, and hold it VERY still for low light situations.Software sucks. The PDC 640 used the PhotoMax software that lets you download the entire contents of the camera into the computer with nifty little unique month/day/image# file names. This one uses PhotoMax Pro and makes you name each picture yourself by using the \"Save As...\" function on every image downloaded.It also has a few needless complexities such as a cumbersome mode selection wheel, and be careful on \"point and shoot\" pictures because the shutter button has 2 positions instead of just one: Click - it focuses (about 2 secs). Click harder - it snaps the picture.Overall, it's a fine camera that succeeded in filling the shoes of its predicessor, and when you compare it to other brands with similar features, you'll find that it gives you more for your dollar than any other.", "Date": "November 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Specifics on this 4.5 star product.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R25B3C3VAC13AC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Re. photo quality:  Darn good for 2.x megapixel.  Great colors.Re. flash:  Marginal to ok/good.  They should have put a hot shoe on it, for a large (aftermarket) flash unit.  Flash is not evenly distributed.  Flash photos at distance=10ft yield burnouts (i.e., bleached centers).  I bought a slave flash unit for better coverage.Re. limitations:  Don't expect to take action shots in dim lighting.  The camera will hold the \"shutter\" open in order to acquire enough light and the photo will turn out blurred.Re. software:  After 50 hrs of use, it still feels kind of odd.  Re. batteries:  The optical viewer is super.  I rarely use the LCD screen... especially since one set of top grade alkalines lasts for about one shooting (i.e., a \"roll\" of 24 or 36 pics) with the LCD on.  With the LCD off, I have shot about1000 pictures with one set of high-quality alkalines (the copper colored ones).  Of course, being the thrifty sort I recharged my non-rechargable alkalines four times now. (I am not recommending that you do this risky thrifting but I have been getting away with it for years.)Re. size:  Feels too thick even though my hands are slighly larger than an average adult male.  Fortunately, Polaroid added some well positioned rubber grips - they have kept the camera from falling several times.Re. zoom:  The optical zoom is a real life saver.  My first camera was the PDC1100 and what a difference!  There is NO WAY I would get a camera without a zoom.  Note: Zooming to 1/2 the distance results in (effective) 4x the resolution.So, the difference between the PDC1100 (1 megapixel) and a PDC2300Z (2 megapixel) using the 2300's zoom is MUCH better than just twice as good.A main reason for my buying the 2300 was the dual output (serial and USB).  Presently, my \"old\" 200MHz computer does not have USB.Without USB downloading is tedious if you have dozens of high res pics.  I bought a 256M compact flash card and would recommend against it if you have serial only.  128Meg would have been more than adequate.Oh, I take out the batteries from my camera when not in use to help extend their life.  The disadvantage is that the clock needs to be reset upon reinstallation.How could it be better:  A wrist strap, a hot shoe, better distribution of the flash, computer controlled activation of pictures, more ease in automatic labeling of pictures when downloading (e.g., autonumerical sequencing available), hands off (i.e., single click) download-save.Was it worth the money?  Yes.The areas where the camera could have been made better probably would have cost the company $40 more but would have been worth 80 to me.", "Date": "October 29, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "MadTownCA \"jdfloriano\"", "ReviewID": "R35DPEZ33CISFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This will be my second Digital Camera in over 4 years and I think it is a great value.  The opportunity to switch from several different pixel levels is great for just about all ocassions.  The resolution on the best setting is phenomenal.  I haver used it at work and at home.  The uploading from camera to PC is quick and easy.  Erasing unwanted pictures is also easy to do.  You can view the pictures on the LCD screen on the camera, on the PC, or on the Television set.  I owned a Canon Previously and it was not as easy to use the resolution was not as good quality as the Polaroid PDC2300Z and I paid double the price for that camera.  Also, one more thing to add.... The batteries seem to last a long time.  You do not have to use the LCD screen to take pictures you can use the traditional camera view finder.  That saves a tone of $$$$ on batteries.

I use Shutterfly.com to process the prints and they come out great .. even the 8\"x10\".A simple solution to the white-out on the flash is to get some (low-tack) WHITE (because standard masking tape will produce a yellow glow to all your pictures)and place it over the flash. it will calm down that burn-out quite a bit, and since its low-tack, you can take it off easily without leaving the camera \"tacky\". I keep a roll in my camera bag, I usually only use one strip, but you can double up for close-ups if you are still getting burned.I recommend this camera to anybody seeking a good entry level digital. And on another note, if you are using Photoshop to manipulate your photos, I strongly recommend the plug-in Intelihance by Extensis, it really cleans up the pictures good.(while still giving you full control).", "Date": "December 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good...Kinda", "Author": "Trevor \"Tjash\"", "ReviewID": "RP1VOWAWZUR2J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "THis camera worked for about 2 months.

The zoom gets you in for most shots; the selectable resolution will stretch the life out of the memory (buy more than the 8 MB installed to make the most of it).

I did buy larger memory card -64MB from the onset. With the lowest resolution, which is enough for just e-mailing photos, I can take around 1000 photos. Pretty good if you have no access to a computer for a while.As for the camera, I just love it - quality of pictures (2 types of resolution and 3 modes for compression) is pretty amazing; mechanical zoom is great ( I never liked digital zoom, because it destroys the quality); ease of use is great( you can figure it out in less than half an hour); and it comes with a whole kit of software, cables, leather case, etc. (something you have to pay extra if you are buying other digital cameras).Oh, and it is pretty resistant - I dropped mine twice on the floor and it's still working well.  But don't just drop it on the floor to try that....Now for the bad side. My basic complaint is the flash- it usually \"whitens\" the object, I can't explain why but someone in another review did. As for the complaint that it's bulky and heavier than some other digital cameras, yes, it's true, but I like it. The software is not your dream one, but you can use a different software - I am using PhotoImpression 2000 (comes with HP digital cameras) and thus I get arounf the tedious task of saving each picture individually. You can download the latest driver for PDC-2300Z from Polaroid website.Finally, let me finish on a positive note - Polaroid technical support is pretty good and their website has a good Q &A section to help you with any problems that might arise. My review is featuring 5 stars since the disadvantages are really minor in comparison to all the other great features of the camera.
