{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value in a small camera. Reminds me of a modern PowerShot", "Author": "J. M., Tamur", "ReviewID": "R3V6NYTECPT0ZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my Powershot finally died, I decided it was time to buy a new camera. I came across this camera recently, because I saw that Pentax (a SLR camera brand I also know) sold a compact camera, I had to try it.I have been impressed so far! It seems to have so many more features than other camera (including Canon) has. It has a 16-multishot burst frame mode, Face or Smile detection and even macro and super macro modes. All for about 30% less than those other Canon, Nikon and Panasonic cameras. I liked this better than another Fuji camera I was comparing it with. Plus,  it had good reviews on Photography Blog dot com and CNET UK.What I like about it most is the fact it has so many customization options including muting the camera, changing the sounds and the option to use the 22x digital zoom. I also liked the fact the charger is separate from the camera and the battery life is excellent. It has held up about 3 months between charges and only takes about 1-2 hours to charge.Great job Pentax!", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Convenient, screwless removable faceplate system holds interchangeable cosmetic skins of any design from colors to gradients, patterns to images, to uniquely suit the photographer.\nChoose from 10 included skins, or create your own using PENTAX Personal Skin Designer software or skin stencil.\nInterchangeable colored lens rings compliment skin designs.\nUltra slim, lightweight, and pocketable for easy portability.\nHigh resolution 14 megapixel CCD records outstanding detail for large prints or cropping flexibility.", "Name": "Pentax Optio RS1500 14 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom and Interchangeable Face Plates (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Cu%2BR2RSL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004S9BVS4"}}
