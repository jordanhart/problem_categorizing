In September 2006 it stopped working and in December 2006 it was repaired under warranty.  I am not an avid picture taker but I wanted a decent digital camera to use on vacations.  In June 2007 I left for a 7 week trip of Canada's maritime provinces but 2 weeks into the trip the camera failed again.  since it has been over 1 year since the original camera was purchased Kodak will not stand behind the product.  I will never buy another Kodak product again!", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "V705 Camera", "Author": "G.

The wide angle ability is amazing and you dont truely appreciate it until you look thru someone elses camera and see how limited the frame is. I dont know why they dont make more p&s; cameras like this. Im about to move up and purchase my first DSLR, and im actually very sad to be letting go of this camera. Its not the best for zoom or high resolutions but its made it thru tons of vacations and always took adequate pictures. Although when i bought it the price was significantly less, i definitely got more than my moneys worth.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "pennyo", "Author": "Penny Ostlund", "ReviewID": "RLOVIPXVDQWBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product.
