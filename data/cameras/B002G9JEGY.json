{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great for the money", "Author": "William Winters \"Polaroid Fanatic\"", "ReviewID": "RB0T59SBYUZ8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this toy camera for something fun to have in my photography bag.  It's very simple to use, insert film, wind it up, and start shooting.  There is no changing of the aperture or anything else for that matter. It is NOT a true-color film camera.  The contrast from each picture is different from reality.  Now this is why I bought this camera.  Depending on the film used and light conditions, colors can become extremely vivid, washed out, or just right.  It's hard to tell what kind of color you'll get unless your an advanced or professional photographer.  I myself am neither, however I'm not a beginner.  I use more digital.  Another thing this camera produces is the vignetting (the darkening in the corners).  Again, depending on the film and light conditions, vignetting may appear.  This camera can be purchased in a variety of colors such as blue (the one shown), white, black, gold, yellow, pink, etc).  I am giving it five stars because it has done what I wanted it to do.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Little Camera.....BIG Fun!", "Author": "SuPReMiuM", "ReviewID": "R34TH75HR9M2MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, Let me just say, that when looking at, or buying these cameras, keep in mind that they are a TOY-camera. Aside from that, this little guy or gal is a doozie. It is super light, super slim, and the lens is super wide. I have found my best results to be with 200,400,and 800 speed films, 100 is ok too, but make sure it is a bright one outside. DO NOT take indoor pictures with this camera, unless you are in a sun room, you will not be happy with the results, there is no flash or hotshoe for this camera, that is why I do not suggest indoor pics. Anywho, the colors and sharpness of the photos you get back are AMAZING! I have taken this hiking and camping, and got tons of great photos! Plus the light weight and compact size make it easy to travel with this camera. I bought this one for my girlfriend, and a Slim Black Devil for myself! Get one! Tons of Fun!", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brilliant", "Author": "Travis Juntara \"Frug-O-taku\"", "ReviewID": "R2PAYIECOOE2L3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes great photos.However, the camera needs a lot of light, and at 1/125 leaf shutter, you have to hold it a bit stiller than I would've liked. Definitely the cheapest, most pocketable super-wide in the market, and an excuse to keep shooting film every once in a while.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shipping and handling wasn't that great", "Author": "MinMooMoo", "ReviewID": "R29Q00XGJ3M5RC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered a Superheadz Wide and Slim Blue Ribbon camera. I received a Black Slim Devil. Which was fine since I didn't really want a blue one (I only got it because it was cheaper).But the thing that wasn't really acceptable was that mine was tampered with. The stickers that held the packaging together was obviously opened and covered with lint. I nearly panicked when I noticed that the strap that was supposed to come with it was missing. (I found it IN the camera when I checked to see if the inside was damaged).But the camera itself is good. It's light and easy. Although I wasn't able to use it yet, I'm very excited to.Although the handling was not as great, everything came in one piece. Nothing was missing.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$34.95", "Features": null, "Name": "Blue Ribbon (Wide Angle Lens) Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hOx3SCADL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002G9JEGY"}}
