I am so glad that i did. I have never had a camera with such clarity and speed at the same time.  I take a lot of pictures of sunsets and i was blown away when the Jet trails in the sky showed up so clearly.  There is a lot of flexibility with this camera for professionals and for those who are just learning.  This kit came with everything i need to get quality pictures. I would recommend this camera to anyone that is ready to take the next step in their photography!", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Lena Campbell", "ReviewID": "RQYUYL7KSAPW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm still learning, but so far this camera is awesome.

There are a few things I have to learn to use, but my original idea was to shoot with a camera rather than the guns I had been using.  Seems like I have lost my interest in \"shooting from the hip\" and hope to make my time in the woods A-OK for me.  The boys can hunt and I will hunt for neat pictures with my camera.  I have to admit I was scared to touch it because I am use to a PHD camera (Push here dummy) this one will take a bit to learn the in's and outs of and I am still scared of it.  Hopefully I will get over that part.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "great starter kit", "Author": "Jeff57", "ReviewID": "R29X20B66YZOOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All ways had 35mms film, it's been many years scene using.
