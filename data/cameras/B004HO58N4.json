The reviews that could find were pretty good.  First the good:  It is a solidly built, attractive camea that fits well in the hand.  The image stablization seems very good.  After going through several cameras destroyed by damage I was looking for something I could take cycling, hiking, etc and have it survive modest drops, rain and sand.  It might be that this camera will handle the elements well, but I was so unhappy with the quality of the pictures and the camera's performance that I wil be returning it today.The first big negative is that it takes 4-5 seconds to start up.  Given that the most recent coolpix cameras are basically instant on their startup I really don't see an excuse for this.  Second, the auto focus is extremly slow, often 2+ seconds.  And finally the shutter lag after depressing the button is 2 seconds.  This means from the time I take the camera out of my cycling jersy until I can take a picture is 9 seconds.  That is a long, long time.Secondly, this camera is pretty much the worst I have seen in low light conditions. And I use \"low light\" loosely since basically anything other than full sunlight is a problem. Anything inside, even with full lighting, will be blurred.  The other thing is that inside pictures make very \"orange\" looking pictures unless the flash is used.The description of the camera tauts its ability to take \"sports\" pictures and to \"hold\" focus on moving objects.  I just can't agree with this at all.  I tried a whole variety of pictures of moving objects including running children, cyclists and slow moving cars and it just blurs.  I wish I could upload some pictures taken with the camera to show what I am talking about.While I didn't have high expectations of their \"continuous\" shooting mode, it is basically worthless at a picture every 4-5 seconds even with a class 10 memory card.  Looks like I am going to have to investigate more expensive options.The movie capture ability was actually pretty decent although I do see a lot of artifacts in the encoding when I play it back.  But the capture is very smooth.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality is Poor", "Author": "B.

Antonio \"CMDTA\"", "ReviewID": "R4U3TASVLXKUX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I want to start by saying that a lot of the reviews for this camera really surprise me.  You buy a camera that is designed to be abused and then complain that it doesn't have the best picture quality?Nikon, Panasonic, and others make a camera very similar to the Fuju XP30.  The major difference is the XP30 cost about a third of the other makers.This camera feels like it should be fragile but you really can drop it, drown it, and use it in some extreme conditions.  The picture quality is outdoor daytime lighting is very good. The optical zoom in a camera like this is a nice feature that comes in handy. The GPS doesn't only work well it's amazing that this camera even has one.  I challenge you to find any other camera with built in (real)GPS for under $130.  They just don't exist.The low light quality is not good but I wouldn't expect to take decent photos in low light with a $130 point and shoot camera.The one place that this camera does suffer is it's battery life.  This thing will chew right through it's charge in less than a day.  The best thing you can do is buy a second battery if you are going on vacation and plan to be taking a lot of photos.  If you are only going to  be using it for four or five hours of shooting between charges you shouldn't need a second battery.Overall you are going to have a hard time beating this camera.  Waterproof, dust proof, drop resistant, cold resistant, and GEO tagging for under $130. I've seen a lot of $130 point and shoot cameras that don't even include a battery.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "a huge dissapointment", "Author": "outwash", "ReviewID": "R2IIIBOBF9B9IE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera becasue it was the cheapest ruggedized GPS camera on the market.  I needed to georectify pictures for my job - but they did not have to exact - just within 100-200 feet.First the pros -1) takes pretty good pictures for a ruggedized camera.2) it seems like it will be very ruggedized.3) It creates a file that can be added to ARCGIS and and then linked to the photos.  It took me awhile to figure out how to do this (tech support was not help at all) but it can be done.Now the cons: -1) the GPS is awful - I've been using GPS since 1992 and I have never come into contact with anything near this bad.  some of my points were two miles off.  I don't know how they found a GPS this bad - they must have looked really hard.  The idea that you could use the camera to navigate back to a photo (as they advertise) is a joke.  I didnot expect 1 meter at this price but I thought at least the pictures would be within a 200 feet of so.2) sometimes it takes 10 minutes or more to lock in on a point - and this in Colorado grasslands - not the amazon rainforest3) the battery is awful - if you use the GPS as all the battery will drain after about 30 minutes of use.  Even if you set the camera to only use GPS when the camera is on, it appears to have a defect where it keeps the GPS running all the time.If it was just a ruggedized camera I would give it 3 or 4 star, but because the GPS was such incredibly false advertising I am giving it a 1 star.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for Surfing", "Author": "Sickpup94", "ReviewID": "R22QLEQJ2SJX07", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took this camera to the beach, more specifically, surfing. It did a great job of catching my friends riding waves and wiping out. Easy to operate the functions even through my 3mm surfing gloves.I love the one touch video function. You can zoom in & out while in video mode. It also allows for \"scene' modes. I didn't really need those on this trek so I kept everything on \"Auto\". The pics and vids came out really good.I couldn't find the max zoom on it (digital), but I was in the ocean, so I wasn't going to screw around with settings too much.Very durable display screen. I kept it tucked in my wetsuit and it didn't get a single scratch. I highly recommend the Olympus Float Strap for around $13 so you don't end up camera-less with it acting as a new fish home at the bottom of the ocean floor. Get a bright color so you don't lose it in all the white water.Overall, it's a good waterproof camera.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera, But Water Got In", "Author": "R. Toro \"Tech Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R2LJXJ981FLSTC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for a recent cruise to the Caribbean. I wanted something I could use to take pictures at the beach and while snorkeling - and not have to worry about it getting wet or sandy. In that sense, it was a pretty good camera. The quality of pictures it takes is not great, but it is pretty good (though at 14 Megapixels you would expect it to take good photos). However, after a week of use, water got into my camera.It is important to note that the battery door has a double-clicking lock mechanism, which is an improvement over the previous version of this camera. The new lock mechanism displays a visual indication of whether or not the battery door has been closed and sealed properly. This is important because if the door is not closed all the way, then water gets in. With that said, I made sure that the door was always closed properly, but I still got water in the camera, eventually ruining the unit.Knowing that I would be snorkeling, I was very happy to see that the description of this camera states that it is waterproof up to 5 meters (16.5 feet). Most of the other waterproof cameras were only waterproof to 3 meters (about 10 feet), so I was hopeful that this camera would work well for snorkeling, as I often hover around the 10 ft. deep mark while snorkeling.  I may have gone too deep with it, but I would be surprised if I actually made it down to 16 feet, as I tend to have a difficult time diving down that deep while snorkeling, but regardless, the camera got water in it in less than a week of use.So just a warning, if you use this camera in the water, try to avoid diving down too deep (I would definitely stay above 10 feet), in order to prolong the life of your camera.Camera Function:I was not pleased with the actual function of the camera and the layout of the menus and buttons.  This may be due to the fact that I am used to using Kodak cameras and not Fuji Film cameras, so if you have used a Fuji Film camera in the past, this may not apply to you. But I found it difficult to quickly change between shooting modes (i.e. underwater mode, to beach mode, to panorama, to close up, to back-light mode, etc). With other cameras I have used, all it takes is a twist of a dial or pressing one button to pull up a screen of all available modes, but with this camera, you have to go to settings and scroll through the options (I found it cumbersome).The only good thing about the buttons that I really liked was the REC button for videos. With one button press you could quickly switch to video mode and begin recording - that is definitely a plus if you are in situations were you might want to quickly record something (although I think most newer cameras now have this feature).In summary, the picture quality was acceptable, the battery life was good (I could go the whole day on one charge while on vacation), the underwater photos and videos came out well, BUT the menu functions were not very user friendly and most importantly, the \"waterproof\" camera got water in it - therefore it failed to meet my needs. If you were to use this camera strictly on the surface of the water, or at the very least, not take it too deep, then this may fulfill your needs. However, for a snorkeler, this camera will probably not last very long.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for the active.", "Author": "JLJanda", "ReviewID": "RHY8YD10MGJCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the XP30 to replace the last model after I ended up breaking it.

All the menus and features are very intuitive and the battery life is respectable in real life usage... I haven't had to worry about missing anything due to battery life. The only con that I have noticed with the new XP30 model is that occasionally I get \"fuzzy\" pictures. The older versions couldn't take a bad photo, and this can be frustrating.

I do have to admit that I have dropped it and all is well.The problem, however, is the response time of the shutter. I don't think I am a picky person but when you are trying to shoot pictures of little ones, they don't really wait for the camera to actually take the  picture. I usually get a crazy face or the back of a head rather than the shot I was looking for. Another problem I have is the lighting has to be as if the sun was on my shoulder at all times. The flash feature is ok but if it is on, it stays on. This also drains the battery very fast. The video option works only if there is a lot of light as well. If it is at night and you are using a lamp or \"indoor\" lighting, your video will look grainy and orange/red in color with difficulty seeing the video it's self. I wish I would have gotten the other camera I was looking at that was less expensive. Don't get me wrong, the under water photos are a cool idea but I think that the disposable cameras that are used for underwater photo capture work just as well. I would not recommend this camera unless you don't mind losing the shot you were working for. If you didn't plan on taking pictures and just want something you can fling around,then this is the one for you.

I took this camera on a two-week sailing trip to the Bahamas.  I read the instructions carefully to make sure that I was doing everything correctly (I didn't want any issues due to operator error).  It worked fine -- above water.  When I finally had an opportunity to go snorkeling, I was very excited to see how this camera would perform.  It did fairly well...for about 45 minutes.  Then the display stopped working.  I learned afterward that the camera would still continue to take photos, you just couldn't tell what the subject was.When I got back on the boat, I carefully rinsed the camera in fresh water, as instructed.  After it had time to thoroughly dry, I opened it and noticed a small amount of moisture inside the battery compartment and cable connector compartment.  I left those two doors open for the rest of the day, and gradually the display began to work again.I successfully used the camera again -- above water.  Two days later, when I took it snorkeling for the second time, the display screen filled with water.  Thorougly disgusted, I brought the camera home and returned it.

Furthermore it seems that you have to turn off the GPS completely instead of putting the camera on the GPS only when on option to stop the technology from draining your camera.

Always make sure the latch to the battery chamber is locked, if there is yellow showing, that means it's still open!

Underwater features were nice, but you have to test out all the scene selections to figure out which does best.

I hurriedly brought it to shore and dried it off and opened the hatch, a drop of water had seeped in and had gone in where the battery was. Dried off battery and sd card and left it for a day, then reinserted the battery and sd card. Worked fine for a while, then the screen kept freezing and wouldn't unfreeze til you removed the battery. Camera is totally ruined, screen doesn't function, so you can't view any of pictures, or use it to take any anyway.

I bought this camera prior to going on a kayak trip. The pictures from the kayak, especially in low light, were terrible. But the video worked pretty well. After a month, I used the camera in the water to take pictures of waves crashing. During the second session, water leaked into the battery compartment, destroying the camera. I thought it was my fault, and, since it was cheap and took decent video, I bought another. The second time, I used it twice to take pictures of my gf learning to surf. In tiny waves, with little to no jostling, the camera completely filled up with water, ruining my memory card.

The viewfinder screen on the back is nearly impossible to discern on even a cloudy day, making it very clumsy to ask another person to take your picture.  Picture quality underwater is barely acceptable - barely means you can sorta determine the subject in greenish-gray lack-of-color, unless you're very close in gin-clear water.  The proprietary battery is another, expensive, unnecessary hassle; AA or AAA batteries are standard for virtually all other digital cameras.  I lost the camera to water intrusion via the button area on top after 18 months of sporadic use.  I discovered there is no \"o\" ring-type sealer there, just a tight fit and \"good-luck, sucker\".  When the camera gasped it's death rattles, I was on a long-awaited tarpon fishing trip to the Florida Keys.  Timing is everything, but I won't be the proud owner of another Fuji product.  The camera had too many cheesy short comings to believe that, in the future, Fuji can produce a camera worthy of my scarce money.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warning!

On sale, so why not give it a try, and even bought an extended warranty?  My caution to only use the camera top-water snorkeling after the Olympus experience extended to a break-in, above water time so that I could get used to the camera.  That period was about nine months (no water exposure).  Finally a dream trip to French Polynesia gave me the perfect time to finally test out the camera under water.  First time, no problem.  Since it was in salt water, and according to the owners manual, I soaked the camera in fresh water.  Next day, prepared for more great shooting, I again took the camera snorkeling.  Yes it dangled from my floating wrist strap, but no more than two feet.  First picture, the screen went white and the camera died.  I called Fuji upon my return.  Their reply was, \"You do know that you need to have all seals replaced after one year or the warranty is void.\"  No, I didn't know and replied after learning the price of a seals replacement, \"You mean to say that every year the camera will cost me an additional $50 for seals and cleaning + shipping costs?\" \"Yes, and because I did not have it cleaned and seals replaced, even though the camera failed the second time in the water, that voided both warranties.\"  Fuji suggested I read the manual more carefully next time.

I went to Fort Lauderdale, Florida with a friend, her and I LOVE taking pictures of everything an anything. When we first got there we stayed a friends house I used it in their swimming pool worked great, picture quality was decent. Rinsed the camera off and soaked it. Then we went to our hotel, I used it in the ocean for a few hours, again, worked great, picture quality was good. Again went back up to the room and rinsed the camera and soaked it. The next day we went on a snorkel trip, we were required to wear life vests which I thought was idiotic but anyways..I got my flippers and goggles on, and hopped on into the water. Not even 10 minutes later the camera started making this very high pitched noise and then it shut off, refused to turn back on. As i said before we were required to wear life vests so I wasn't able to go more than 5 feet deep before being yanked back up to the top. Got back to the hotel rinsed it off, soaked it, waited for it to dry. I opened it up and low and behold there were signs of rust I hurried up and took my memory card  out I was afraid it was ruined (thank goodness it wasn't). I'm so happy I bought this camera right before I left for my trip as I was able to return it to the store.

I researched cameras and thought this one, in the $150-$200 offered a lot of the features she'd like - as a teenager. The tagging and easy Facebook uploads were a bonus, being waterproof an even bigger bonus.When she opened it, she was disappointed. She had been looking forward to a Canon or Nikon (if only in hindsight I'd listened). But got used to the waterproof idea and liked the easy upload features. The clasp for the memory card seemed a little loose and occasionally it would snap open. When I called about it, I was told to pay $30 and they'd SEE if it was a defect. Really? After JUST purchasing it less than 90 days ago? We took it to an authorized shop, paid and waited two months before we got it back.In May, she went on a trip to Catalina Island with her 8th grade class. The first day she took it underwater, the clasp snapped open again and flooded the camera. We sent it in per FUJI guidelines AGAIN. This time they said it was user error and would not cover it.So I paid $150 for a camera, $30 for shipping TWO Times ($210 total) and have a broken POS that FUJI refuses to replace.

On my first usage in a river rafting event, I already see the problems with this camera:1) I am experienced with Camera and camcorders, I know how to hold them properly. But the lens head is placed in a very awkward place, your fingers will easily cover part of the lens head. So, don't be surprised to see your fingers in the final photos and video clips. It's almost for sure that you will not get photos or videos of yourself. Because other people may not be able to hold this camera properly to take yours.2) Hard to fine tune the zoom speed. Not convenient, but I can live with that.3) The camera won't focus while zooming (it will focus after zooming stops). This is a typical issue with non-DSLR camera in video mode. I saw the same thing in Panasonic camera also. Not a big issue to me.4) This is the biggest flaw, the audio is not in sync with the video. I have to turn off the audio from the video clips, and add background music when producing the final movie for the rafting trip. Even my simple Flip video camera handle this better than this Fuji camera.5) The video quality is no way to compare with regular HD camcorder. The image is kind of grainy, even at 1pm strong sunshine with good light. Again, I can accept this since I am in a condition (around water) where normal camcorder can not be used.6) Indoor photo quality is no way to compare with my 5-year-old 5MP Panasonic camera.But this is OK to me since I am in a condition (around water) where my normal camera can not be used.If this is the only camera you want to have, I won't recommend this. However, if your intend is \"ONLY\" to take photos, videos in conditions where your normal gears can not, then I think this Fuju XP20 is acceptable....if you don't mind the out-of-sync audio problem.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very poor picture quality", "Author": "D.
