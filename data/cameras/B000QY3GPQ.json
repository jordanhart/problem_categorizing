Roesler", "ReviewID": "R3LLFX5IIEE7FW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited for this camera, bought it as soon as it came out (in August 2007) and have been extremely pleased with the purchase.  This camera is easy to use right out of the box---I selected it mainly because of its great zoom capabilities (the major feature for me). Although I wish it were a little smaller, it still fits just fine in a pocket and has been really rugged.  I haven't had any issues with the batteries, 1 set of batteries lasted for my whole 2-week vacation where I took approximately 200 photos with it, and the batteries still aren't dead. I love the optical zoom capability (truth be told, I rarely use the digital zoom but when I do, it works great:  may look grainy on the viewing screen but the actual photo comes out just great), the stabilization, the large viewing screen, the great photos it takes, and the ease of use. Adjusting the flash enables the camera to take great photos in pretty much any kind of light:  if you want lowlight photos (for silhouetted sunsets, for example) you just turn off the flash and it takes really good, true-to-the-eye photos.  I am just a normal person with no real camera experience other than my earlier digital cameras that I owned (I like this one a lot better).  I could take basic photos and easily use the basic features (such as zoom) right out of the box:  it took me a little while to get used to all the features but once I learned to use them, this is truly a compact, awesome little camera.  I am a Hewlett-Packard employee and could select any HP camera for my personal use, but I really like this one for a simple family digital camera (and the Wasabi would be my second choice, which is a little more compact but doesn't have as much zoom).", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works Great!", "Author": "J.

Pierre-louis \"Great taste but Cheap\"", "ReviewID": "R1166WBCMZBSOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am happy with my purchased of the HP Mz67, it is extremely user friendly, simple and straight to the point. It is a major difference from a 3x zoom camera to the a 6x zoom.Likes: 6x zoom, anti-shake mode and super close-up mode work perfectly, 2.5\" screen, easy to change settings, the price. Fix red eyes right in the cameraDislikes: The lens does not retract all the way in the camera, making it a little bigger thank I expected, only 16Mb internal memory (for emergencies). The design gallery could use a little more options and borders etc.. even though I never used those fancy design gallery options, it is always nice to know that you have it if you ever need it and besides that is why photoshop software was created.The camera takes excellent pictures and I don't have to wait for the next presidential election to take another picture. for my line of work the super close-up mode is like a gift from heaven. I had more expensive camera and the Mz67 out-perform them in every category except for fancier options(photoshop fix that issue). For the price and the performance I will recommend the Mz67 to anyone.

I choose this camera instead of replacing the R742 mainly for the price.  The MZ67 had 8 megapixels, and it had the stablization feature and a more power zoom.  The camera takes stellar pictures.  I also like that it uses 2 AA batteries which is easier to replace than having to carry around a special charger for the R742.  The only draw back I have is the size of the lens for the powerful zoom.  The camera is a little chunky.  It fits in most of my purses, is not as slimline as the R742.

Very easy to use, nice large display.  The bad, be careful when you open the compartment that holds the batteries and storage card.  The clip that holds the flap down is made of soft cheap plastic and breaks very easy.  I have to use packing tape now to hold it together It should have been made of metal.  If you take a picture or movie and use the zoom control wait 3-4 seconds before you take the picture or your image will be out of focus.  I found out the hard way and missed a shuttle launch now I have a clip that is out of focus.

This camera is totally useless outdoors in bright sunlight.  You cannot see a thing on the LCD screen, even at its brightest setting, and the battery saving feature turns it off too soon while you are struggling to see the picture.  Trying to use the zoom with a questionable live view is also impossible as you cannot find your target.  The photos that do result appear to be OK, but you can't count on getting what you really wanted.  We had to resort to our old HP Photosmart 935 camera on recent vacation - fortunately we took both along.  Whoever decided that optical viewfinders should be eliminated is crazy.

This camera has a menu that's easy to navigate, and the photos are excellent.  Using non-proprietary AA batteries and an SD card are another two advantages this camera has over the G3.

Gibbons", "ReviewID": "R2XAQLI9MQ7UUW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very disappointed with this camera. I hate to leave a negative review, but I have no choice...I have owned several HP digital cameras(and other products) over the past several years and have loved each and every one of them(I am very faithful to buying only HP products) . They were all easy to use right out of the box and I never ever had any problems with the color of my photos. UNTIL NOW:( I was so exicted to purchase this camera and could not wait til it arrived.It got awesome reviews so I knew it had to be good... The seller sent it promptly(THANK YOU J&R; camera:) and when it arrived I opened the box, and I immediatly started to use it. I work with preschoolers and could not wait to see the photos I had taken of the little cuties. Much to my surprise my photos were a horrible shade of YELLOW!! So I tried again and again and still my photos were yellow...Now, I'm no professional photographer, but I do have several years of experiance using digital cameras, and have never had a problem like this...I called HP and after over an hour of trouble shooting, they sent me a replacement camera thinking perhaps it was defective. Well, that was a month ago and I still have the same issues. I am not sure what I could be doing wrong. I have tried changing the settings and everything and still they are yellow. I am not used to having to change any settings for the color, as I have never had to in the past and my photos turned out beautiful...so perhaps I'm doing something wrong...or perhaps this isn't the camera for me....it's certainly not as easy to use as my past cameras...unfortunatly, it has been over 30 days and I can't return it.
