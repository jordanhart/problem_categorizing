{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This Cable is good", "Author": "John B. Havener \"John H.\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y1GF5HAAKE27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this cable to hook up a CUC7281 700TVL camera.  I found no evidence of high signal loss in this cable.  In fact, I was impressed with performance of the cable.  As with all coaxial cables, I took care not to kink it, bend it too sharply, or crush it with cable hangars. Doing so can cause high signal losses.  This cable is medium gage, so it is easy to handle without kinking or tangling.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the best solution", "Author": "Donald Autrey", "ReviewID": "R20MAKQD25XJWI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The cables seem to have significant signal lose. I am not an engineer so I did not measure db loss. I found a better solution is to use Cat 5 with baluns.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap, poor quality", "Author": "MattKara", "ReviewID": "R3RTVKO0IM3NJG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This cable is extremely thin and cheap. I installed the original cable on my 4 cameras and all suffer huge noise.
