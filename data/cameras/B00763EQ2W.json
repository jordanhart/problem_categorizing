Battery life is only drawback.", "Author": "Richard Hart", "ReviewID": "R27840KPXM8C8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good general use camera with sharp images and very high resolution...it rivals my Canon 50D at one tenth the price.  Waterproof for a pool or snorkeling.  This sells at Walmart for $119.00 as a now discontinued model so do not pay more!  My only disappointment is a very small battery which requires you to use the auto-off feature or it will be dead in an hour.  Otherwise it would get 5 stars!  You need an extra lithium ion battery if you do much shooting, probably $30 or so.  The selling price of $448.56 must be a mistake so be careful.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good deal for $129", "Author": "hha", "ReviewID": "R2PSM33S6BRR1S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for one month and shot more than 500 pictures. While the TG620 can be used in fully automatic mode, it is very flexible in P-mode. Fiddling with the various shooting modes using the toggle and the LCD screen works, but is very slow, particularly under bright outdoors conditions, where the screen is harder to read. The only feature which I miss is exposure bracketing. The internal HDR mode (3 shots are combined in the camera in a very slow 15 seconds!!) is not worth the trouble.  Almost all my shots this far were made in P-mode with -0.3ev exposure compensation, with sequence mode (5 shots per second at full resolution for up to 20 seconds!) enabled.  Shooting with this camera (mine is black) can be very discrete: out of the pocket the first shot is captured in under two seconds, 5 more in the next second, and back into the pocket, all in less than 5 seconds. Try this with your cellphone or DSLR!  Use your hand to keep direct sunlight from shining on the lens (window)to avoid the lens flair which appears to be typical of the periscope lens design.The image stabilization appears to be very effective.The battery is claimed to be good for 300 shots, which may be true. I bought a spare battery ($7), but this far have never used it. Shots at iso800 are perfectly usable, but also more frequently needed due to the  f/3.9 aperture, a compromise for a shirt-pocket camera with the periscope lens design. When inspected at 200%, the image quality of side-by-side shots under bright out-doors conditions with the TG620 is a little below the quality achieved by my Panasonic LX5, but the LX5 rarely leaves my house. My LX5 shows much less lens flair.The LCD screen is very usable outdoors, but nowhere near as much contrast as that of my LX5. The processor and CMOS detector of the Olympus TG620, TG630, TG820, TG-2 and XZ-10 are the same, but the last two cameras have different and two stop faster lenses. Read [...] to get an idea of the TG620 image quality.  I have not had a chance to test the TG620 under water.The seals on the two doors look OK, if they are kept clean. The quality of the seals of the other buttons is hard to assess, but I have not heard any complaints.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "buttons not great", "Author": "Yolanda Leon", "ReviewID": "RA5HD06AFWRQ2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the wheel for selecting different functions is too small, one very often presses the unintended direction and ends up in the wrong menu.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tough and capable", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R1RRHK487HUL60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a wonderful camera. i am what you might call a experienced enthusiast, having owned or operated a wide variety of cameras. canon, nikon, samsung, sony, panasonic, and olympus. everything from $70 point and shoots to $2,000 DSLRs and mirrorless compacts. i can honestly say this olympus TG-620 is capable of capturing stunning images and the weatherproof-lifeproof element is a bonus for a camera which can stand alone for its' image quality. all cameras have their limitations, even $2,500 professional DSLRs.(would you take your Canon EOS 6D out in a blizzard) . this camera has a place in every ones gear bag and i would recommend it in a heartbeat", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, bad USB cable.", "Author": "Marco67", "ReviewID": "R3PGY42KIYZ753", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good camera that gives you great pictures for the price.  But I think is it very annoying that Olympus does not use standard things.  For example the USB cable plug is CB-USB8 which I never saw before.

Afaik, the only rugged cameras even smaller are the Sony cyber shot TX line (super expensive) and the Panasonic TS line.This camera is not supported for UHS speed class, meaning that paying more for a \"Class 10\" memory card is not necessary.  Despite the marking on the memory compartment, you also don't need an expensive XC card because the lowest XC is a whopping 64 Megabytes (holds over 15,000 12MB jpegs).  $$ave by buying an 8 MB Class 6 HC card (holds almost 2000 12MB jpegs).According to many sources, the main difference between the TG-620 and the 630 is the 630's upgrade from Truepic V to VI processor, which speeds up the camera's operational speeds. (it's a bit deceptive that Olympus mentions the Truepic VI on their 620 web page...unless they ran out of TP5 chips and started putting TP6 in the last few 620's just before they were discontinued).  Both models have the same CMOS sensor.I took a star off because both the 620 and 630 have relatively short battery life (the 630's being slightly longer)...although not enough to worry about unless you're filming video.So, basically, if you find the TG-620 for an extremely low price and don't think you're going to need the 630's faster burst speeds and slightly longer battery life, then get the 620.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for active people", "Author": "kathleen l cusimano", "ReviewID": "R17F207EWI3DHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We love this camera.
