{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great in-between camera for walking around", "Author": "Fredric Brown", "ReviewID": "RK4YGE6RT8OHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using both DSLRs and point and shoot cameras for over a decade and they both have their pros and cons, often relating to size vs quality.  This PowerShot is a nice compromise to both goals and has a few bonuses on top of that.  It's obviously not as small as most pocket cameras but its definitely still light enough to be portable and carry around for hours at a time.  The picture quality and setting options are definitely comparable to a low-end DSLR and get the job done even in poor lighting.  Now the perks, this thing has an amazing zoom lens that outshines the range on both of my other cameras, as well as the big flip-out screen which is something they've only just started adding to the newest DSLRs. This camera was a great investment for the money, I almost wish I had splurged and got the newest model but didn't know at the time how much I would love it.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008GKN24W"}}
