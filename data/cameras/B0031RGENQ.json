Then I read some of the negative reviews on Amazon, and started to think that I had gotten duped into buying this camera due to the price point. At first it seemed that all my pictures were blurry, but now I'm here to defend this camera. It really is a great camera. Not the best best camera, but still a good camera. The problem with this camera is that you can't just unbox it, put it on the \"Auto\" setting and constantly get great pictures. You actually have to do a little bit more work with it sometimes. The thing that changed my first impression of this camera was the \"Scene\" function. All I wanted was to get some pictures that could clearly show others what I was seeing at the moment I took the photo. Pictures were blurry, some of the main aspects of photos were out of focus, too dark, too bright, too shaky, or zoom just messed everything up. Then I discovered the \"Scene\" function. Any photo that the \"Auto\" or \"Manual\" setting had a hassle of getting right, the \"Scene\" function could fix. After that, my photos were phenomenal. In the end, the outcome of the photos are really what matter, and that's why I'm giving it a high rating. The reason I don't give it five stars is because of the view screen. Something happens between taking the photo and seeing the outcome on the view screen. No matter what, it will look like you've gotten poor shots judging by the view screen. Today, I asked someone to get a shot of some friends and myself with the camera. The person took a second shot because the first looked blurry, I responded by saying \"It's okay. The picture is fine, the camera just does that.\" Cameras shouldn't do that. I was right though. The picture was great when viewed on my laptop. I will also agree that this camera looks cheap. It looks like a cheap Vivitar. Also, on the issue of batteries. If you hook the camera to a computer, the screen comes on and will continue to drain juice. I use an external reader, and my battery life is fine. Like I said before. This really is an actually decent camera.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "Vickie S. Chapman", "ReviewID": "R2TZLK6SCGVS79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has gotten some bad reviews but I don't know why. Surely it must be the best camera out there for under $100. Check out pictures on my blog ([...]) from June, July, and August 2010. These were all taken with this camera. The menus are very easy to use... I didn't even need to look at the manual to figure out how to do videos, closeups, control the flash, etc, etc. The screen is as visible in bright sunlight as any I've seen. The software that comes with it works well and has some cool features (like face recognition).My one caution is that it's fragile. I dropped it from maybe 4 feet, and it quit working. I don't know that this is any more fragile than most cameras; I did the same thing to my previous camera which is why I bought this one in the first place. Anyway, after I dropped this one, because I liked it so much, I ordered another one just like it.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "a good little camera", "Author": "Engine Driver", "ReviewID": "RQAA9H4PI2NP9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great value.  It is a good little camera for the money.  It is handy and takes good pictures inside and out.  My only issue is with the seller, who said that they were sending a black camera.  This was what was ordered, but not what was sent.  A silver camera was sent. This is not a big deal, I'm not especially fussy about the color.  I am fussy about factual truth, so find the seller's bogus claim that they sent what was ordered to be annoying.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Meh", "Author": "Steve in AZ \"author1701\"", "ReviewID": "R2J3SUCSYBE10L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as a backup to my main camera. It's not bad in bright sunlight or even bright indoor light, but get it in low light conditions and it's marginal at best. Getting autofocus to work in low light conditions is just about impossible. Even in overcast conditions, ideal for most photography, the autofocus is horrible. Using Olympus' version of motion dampening didn't help, either.Lots of great bells and whistles including the ability to go full manual. Can't seem to turn off the digital zoom, though, which is quite annoying. Battery life seems pretty good. Photo quality, when you can actually get the thing to focus, is very good with very little fringing even with the zoom.It's an OK camera if you're using it for everyday outdoor shooting, but don't count on it to be anything other than mediocre. Even with a lower end camera like this, I expected more from Olympus.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Issues from the start", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R18NSIHEUUB13V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera was suppose to be a really good camera.

Also works well for macro shots and in the zoom setting.  Lots of extra features - pretty self-explanatory or on the included CD manual.  You do not have to be an expert to use this camera.  Color has been excellent and true to original.Video quality is okay - what we expected with a camera in this price range (I am coveting one of the more expensive Olympus cameras and hope to eventually get one with a better video option).  A bit grainy and doesn't do well inside - need a lot of light to get a good quality video.  Does MUCH better outside during the day.  BUT we purchased this to be a photo camera, not a video camera - this feature was considered a bonus for us.I am a loyal Olympus purchaser.

Adams", "ReviewID": "RGQUHJQH10FFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having two weeks to try this camera out I have come to a couple of conclusions - find SPOT autofocus setting as quick as you can as the Face/iESP is responsible for most poor photos.  I assume it is trying to find faces in the grass, trees, water, rubble, etc. and produces a poor focus.  Second, the 14 mega pixels is empty resolution, probably past about 4 or 5 mega pixels - the very large jpg files are a nuisance to edit as they require a lot of memory and beyond 50% of scale in Photoshop shows why so much of it is empty resolution - filled with blotches (50% of resolution means I'm looking at 1/4 the area of the image.)  Not the best on batteries, but I haven't been using the powersaving settings, yet.  It is pretty handy for a quick grab-and-go camera and takes adequate pictures.  For the $60 I paid this really is quite a good bargain, just don't expect it to compete with an SLR.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "good camera for the price,not perfect", "Author": "ariel", "ReviewID": "R3HUG7K7JGHSWV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "well i bought this camera in another site for $ 100 and bought another one here in amazon for $ 61 dollars including shipping ,what a great deal.to be sincere the camera is great,you must adjust some settings before use it for the first time.i take amazing pictures with it but must admit it looks like it has lower megapixels than 14,anyway is a very good camera for the price and iam happy with it after trying a vivitar brand that was awful and i got very desapointed,there are better cameras out there but this olympus camera is a great deal for the quality and price.i recomend it if you can't afford a high price camera.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get to know it", "Author": "Randale", "ReviewID": "R5SI7DYMXBGN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Heres my take it's a camera that looks cheap and my be a bummer if you are someone who is used to just using the auto setting. Read the manual and experiment with the photo modes and the really neat features hidden.The screen is deceiving as the images on review look ugly but are real nice quality on the PC.The battery life is good and the power save mode is a real nice add on. It also has features to adjust between battery cell type. Setback is the focus is not that good most times unless using the DIS or face face tracking.Heres a heads up read the manual and try the different modes in different conditions rather than using auto mode and you will see vivid sharp images.

This camera is easy to use and to figure out and it takes pretty good pictures. I got this camera for sixty nine dollars and it's worth it.

This is my first digital camera and I think that this could be a good camera for anybody. A cool thing about this camera is that it not only came with a USB cable to hook up to a computer, it also came with an AV cable to hook up to a TV. I'm so glad that I bought this camera!
