{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Service & Camera", "Author": "John A. Carlson \"Elk Grovian\"", "ReviewID": "R2FNPI71N0KYJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received all items on time and as promised.  All items were new products.  Bought this group of items primarily for the camera but needed the additional stuff to use with the camera.  Had SLR with lens, filters,  & other paraphernalia before digital but have been buying digital point and shoots because I didn't want to carry all that stuff around.  I realized with the new digital p&s;, I could get the picture I wanted most of the time with editing programs compensating for the deficiencies.  I have been waiting for a camera with a good zoom lens that has all the bells and whistles that current DSLRs don't have.  I think I found it with the FZ70.  So far I am impressed with the lens (very good, even at full zoom) and all the features.  It almost seems you can handle most of the editing in the camera.  For example, one feature is, in a sun/shadow shoot, the camera will automatically take 3 pictures and combine them to even out the exposure across the picture (something you would normally perform on a Raw picture with an editing program.)  BTW, the larger body is easier to hold for people with large hands (me).One problem, except one free basic editing program, the camera is so new that few editing programs can process the Raw picture format.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera and good camera set", "Author": "Diego Cabrera", "ReviewID": "R2NHN41MNXVWDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is amazing; of course, it doesn't perform like a reflex, but it exceeds field performance of a reflex, at least in field work for biology and environmental sciences. The only thing that I dislike of the camera set was flash, this is maked for a reflex as I confirm with a friend's camera. However I recomends this camera and its camera set.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "the Precision Design DSLR300 Flash isn't compatible", "Author": "Justin M. Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R14WTZX2OFF6VO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera in here is great including most of the products in here. However, the \"Precision Design DSLR300 Flash\" that mounts in the hot shoe of the camera isn't compatible. The \"Precision Design DSLR300 Flash\" comes with a tiny little cord that is support to plug it in with your camera to sync the flash with your camera, but my camera does not have an outlet for the cord to plug in. I was really looking forward to using my camera with the extra flash, but I'm not able to. other than that the camera is super great although i wish it had an exposure option that was more than 8 seconds.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera and great deal", "Author": "Sherry Caldwell", "ReviewID": "R3VITY63PYAKM2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the camera and all the extras in this package were worthwhile.  I had a Nikon before and this camera out performs it.  The only feature that is missing on this camera is a tilting screen, but everything else is great.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$419.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 13 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 Digital Camera (Black) + <2> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card + <3> Spare DMW-BMB9 Battery +\n<4> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <5> Vivitar 55mm UV Glass Filter + <6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +\n<7> PD-C20 Camera/Camcorder Case + <8> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<10> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> LCD Screen Protectors + <12> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <13> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 Digital Camera (Black) with 32GB Card + Battery + Case + Flash + Tripod + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61D6wZFaj3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E3W3XSC"}}
