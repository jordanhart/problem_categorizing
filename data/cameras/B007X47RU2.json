Years ago my last SLR broke and I replaced it with a pocket sized point and shoot.  I complained for years about the poor quality of that camera until my wife got fed up and got me this kit for Christmas.  It is such a joy to be able to take real photographs again.I'll leave the really technical stuff about this kit  to more advanced folks.  I am totally satisfied!!", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "busymom", "ReviewID": "R3UZMWZRG5EXPI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera for Christmas and although there is a lot of camera, it can also be used surprisingly easily with the auto functions.
