Taken almost 3,000 photos so far, seems to be working great.Pros:Lightweight, easy to useExcellent lithium rechargeable batteryCons:Sometimes not the sharpest photosDoes not include SD cardIf you're looking for professional-quality photography, this is probably not the camera for you.  Go buy a DSLR.However, if you need a cheap, easy digital camera with a great rechargeable battery, at this low-end price level, you can't beat it.  Most of the cameras in this price range do not have rechargeable lithium batteries.  Good first digital camera for those interesting in getting started.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Need a refund..getting the run around", "Author": "sthiede", "ReviewID": "R146DK9CE6ELDF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After only 1 week it broke and we could not get it to turn on or off..it was just stuck and buzzing.

That pretty much sums up how I feel about this camera. Honestly it was horrible, the quality of the pictures were horrible, the camera functions are bad too. Say for example you want to quickly switch from pictures to video capture mode, it takes too long to switch cause instead of having a switch like other cameras, on this one you have to scroll options to get to it. It was so bad I had to return and get a sony cybershot, which works wonders. I went to Japan this summer and if I had used this camera I would've missed so many opportunities for videos. Just go for something kinda expensive and good, that what I say, don't get this thing.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy this Crap", "Author": "Mav2564", "ReviewID": "R716JHLNQT99S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cannot believe that you would sell this product without even a 250mb memory card.
