Worth the price I think. However, it is slow to take a picture. Plus my CB350 does not turn on at certain times. It's an off and on issue. I push the power button, and nothing happens. Funny thing is, I shake the camera, then push the power button and it works then. My wife says to return it. Any others have this issue?", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME SERVICE AND PRODUCT", "Author": "wes", "ReviewID": "R1K9WWDEJ30Y7N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera a week ago and it came to me fast. I am in Afghanistan and I was looking for a camera that will take a toll out here and still work. I can see already that this (being brand new) is something that I can stuff in my pocket and pull it out when needed. The internet is slow as all get out in these parts and I love the feature that lets you pick the size of the photo because I can upload more quickly and send off more expediant than ever. I also like the way this camera takes pictures in the FOB areas at night time without a flash; they come out so clear and seem live like. I am extremely happy with the delivery because it was mailed the next day after I purchased and it came 9 days to my location and that was standard delivery. I read the other reviews before I made my buy and some people say that this camera was cheap made but I disagree. This camera is made like any other that Ive seen so that is not a worry. The only issue Ive noticed was that after a few shots (<20) the battery goes dead but then again it might be the cheap and old batteries they sell out here in the px. But the camera and the service all in all was a great decision and I highly recommend this product and service.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "pdf \"pdf\"", "ReviewID": "R1IW7VU7TLBA5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have owned a HP camera before, so when we went looking for digital camera we naturally selected a HP and we have not been disappointed.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "improve delivery", "Author": "mercedes valentina salazar", "ReviewID": "R1GC443U5MAZJ5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera takes high quality pictures of the product but the presentation was not adequate, operating manual did not bring was shredded and left personal photos should borrarlas.La shipping safety of the product was defective because they sent in a bag, that could deteriorate.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002QQ004M"}}
