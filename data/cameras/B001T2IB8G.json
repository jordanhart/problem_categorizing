Bayko \"Roadwarrior\"", "ReviewID": "R1IRWP8O9701P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many years ago I did quite a bit of photography; and so I know what it takes to get a great photo.  Unfortunately the digital cameras, particularly the small ones, have been hampered by slow ability to capture light, and thus get clear pictures in Low light without a flash, or get great shots at High Speeds.  Also the digital camera's ability to distinguish between a strong backlight, faces, a variety of scenes, like bright sun, shade, cloudy days, indoor light, has been poor, but gradually getting better across the last 4 years.  This Nikon S620, solves all of those problems.  All of these situations are corrected in this camera automatically if you want to just point and shoot.  It is a master of computer engineering.  For several years now with most of the strong brands, you could get good pictures in all the above situations, by correcting for red eye, selecting special scenes, and using tripods in low light.  What I wanted to see if, with this Nikon, IF you set it to complete auto, you could get great pictures.  Has the computer advanced far enough, where it could anticipate all these situations and give you a great picture?  Answer is a resounding yes.  I have tested this for a month, and I love it so much; I have now bought one for one of my daughters.  This model as some professional reviews have said is a bit more practical for everyday situations, because of the wide angle.  What it lacks in the Zoom, though the S630 is tempting; it makes up in speed, to handle all the above situations well.  The controls are easy to operate.  The high Megapixel count let you crop photos closer and still have a great picture; like the one I uploaded with the bird nesting.  The anti-shake /vibration works well; to give you almost always clear shots, in these difficult situations.UPDATE MAY 7th. : I looked at the S630 Product page and noticed 6 reviews, all but one positive. The one negative review, talks about noise in pictures and poor performance in low light. The speed rating of the 620 is much higher than the 630, at native resolution; thus resulting in sharper pictures in the extremes of photography, low light and high speed. I belive by my own photo's the 620 is a remarkable advancement in giving excellent pictures acorss the range. I am not saying, to not buy the 630; only that the powerful zoom in such a small camera is not without compromise. Thus there may be issues with that camera when used as an all around camera. If you are looking for an excellent all around camera; the Nikon S620 is THE one to buy!", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Tiny, powerful and fast.", "Author": "Mark Dalzell", "ReviewID": "RKQMP9ICQT0KT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this S620 as a replacement for my aging and failing Coolpix S51. I was looking for something faster and smaller and this camera is definitely both of those things. It was a tough decision between this and the S630.. which has a slightly higher resolution and a 7x zoom, but I decided that the speed more than makes up for it. The advertised .7 second startup time is pretty much right on... power button press to first image recorded is a little less than 2 seconds, and it can take 2 pictures in about 3 seconds in single mode. This varies a bit depending on light, subject and which extra features that you have on.  The smile detector and blink proof are nifty toys, but I don't really care and I leave them off. It's true that it takes about 3 seconds to load up the zoom and other features, but if you just need to power up fast to catch an unexpected shot, then 2 seconds is all it takes. The pictures it takes are very sharp and the colors are vibrant, and the macro works great down to less than 1\". It takes pretty clear pictures in nearly pitch black, automatically adjusting to ISO 1600. I tried setting it to ISO 6400 to see what would happen but the resulting picture was mostly useless. It must be for high speed action rather than low light applications. As for negatives, my biggest would be that the metering options are limited. The 2 choices are Matrix and Center Weighted, but the Center Weighted is all over the place. On my old S51 if you told it center, then it focused on whatever was in the center no matter what. The center weighting on the S620 tries to guess what you were aiming for somewhere near the center, and it's often not right.... so you have to keep trying until it figures out what you want. The other negative was already mentioned by another reviewer, and that's that Nikon uses a non-standard USB cable. I usually pull the card out to save battery power when I'm transferring pictures, but it's worth noting for other potential purchasers.As a side note, I purchased this from J&R;, and when it arrived it was the kit version, which included the Nikon 5811 leather case - so I'm glad I didn't spend the extra $18 on that... before you buy the case separately, check with the retailer to see if it's included.** Update ** Okay - it's been a few weeks, a few thousand miles and 1000 or so pictures and I have one negative to add to my review. The camera boots up and shoots instantly and takes a few seconds to load up everything else, which is already known. What I discovered is that between about 2 and 4 seconds after the camera is turned on it won't do anything at all. So 0-2 seconds = take a picture, 2-4 seconds = miss your shot, 4+ seconds = full power. I tend to turn my camera off and was relying on the instant startup, but I had to plan accordingly if something was coming in 3 seconds that I wanted a shot of... :)Otherwise, the camera has worked perfectly in every other respect so far.[...]", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but has a few caveats...", "Author": "M. Paisner", "ReviewID": "R34EU7LUJDBEKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: Great Flash, Three inch LCD, Easy ControlsCons: Made in China, Long time to take picture, PROPRIETARY USB CABLEBest Uses: Point and shoot, Flash shotsI just got back from two weeks in Australia and bought this a couple days before I left for my point and shoot as an adjunct to my Nikon D200 DSLR.I got flash shots the wimpy flash on my D200 wouldn't get.Startup time is a bit too long for me. Time between shots is great.I didn't take the manual figuring if I needed it, I'd download it. I didn't need it. Controls are intuitive although it takes getting used to the rotary control. HOWEVER, the flash is fast and easy to shut off (or change settings) and that's a big plus over my old Canon.On the negative side, this baby takes a long time to take the photo. It's about 2 seconds. It must be doing all the face searching and focusing, etc., but I had to learn to hold the button down until it went through it's gyrations, and that's a long time.MOST ANNOYINGLY: I went to download the pictures at the end of the first day in Australia only to find it doesn't use a standard USB cable. I left the proprietary cable at home because I carry one standard USB cable. I didn't have a card reader with me (I have about 3 at home) and they were very expensive in Austalia. So I waited until I got back to download and backup my photos. With my girlfriend's Canon point and shoot and my D200, I downloaded the photos each night to my Macintosh laptop, then copied the full sized photos to my iPod. That way, there were 3 copies. And I never keep the 3 devices in the same place.I'd give this camera 4 stars with faster shoot times and 5 stars for a standard USB cable interface.Lastly, I would never take the advice of \"get a large memory card.\" Get several 2Gb cards and rotate them. This way, if you lose a card or the camera gets stolen, you don't have all your vacation photos in one place.

I also bought it to replace an aging digital (Kodak). I did a lot of research because for me $300+ is a lot of money.  For my purposes, which is home inspection pictures, I could not be more pleased!It is THE fastest starting, compact digital point and shoot out camera out there right now. The speed of startup is very important to me. The old camera took about 7+ secs. to start. This one is about 1.5 like others have said but, not all the functions are available for another second or so depending on which features you have enabled. It shuts off just as fast. I turn the camera on and off a lot and it adds up over the course of a day.The other nice thing about this camera is that it is almost a pro-sumer camera. It's a great blend of a high end digital SLR features and the ease of point and shoot. I know it's not a $2,000 SLR so pros please don't blast me. What I mean is that it takes excellent photos in a wide range of situations, automatically. Auto is the setting I use most because, unlike a lot of other cameras, other Coolpix included, it does do what it is supposed to do. Odd huh? Funny when that is the exception instead of the norm.That said, it is easy enough to use right away and has list of features deep enough for anyone wanting to manually set any or all the the controls manually. There is an automatic setting, the one I use most of the time, which is like any other auto setting people are used to but, there is also an *automatic* SCENE setting. So it's not just inside vs outside or flash vs no flash. No guessing or fiddling with \"Is this a sport shot or a back lit situation?\". That will change to the best scene mode available, automatically. It's all the cool features I was ever promised on other cameras, delivered.It also has an automatic lens cover which is awesome. My other one was always clanging around one way or another. Putting it on or taking it off sometimes I would accidentally touch the front of the lens and it drove me nuts!The stabilization is also very good. I shake a lot when taking photos and this camera has two stabilization methods. You can use one or the other or both or none. Depending on how you set the camera up it, works very well. I used to have to carry a mono pod with me all the time. I now leave it at home.The panorama feature is also one of the best and easiest I have ever used. It overlays the last shot to the next in the LCD as you take the series of photos. It can pan left, right, up or down. Very cool!The only con I can think of is that the LCD screen on the back of the camera is flush with the back of the case, like an iPod, and I am afraid I'll forget and set it down on its back and scratch the screen. I am looking for one of those silicone skin covers to give it a smidgen of inset to prevent this from happening. So no worries there for me.Aside from that one issue the camera is just great and I am very happy with my purchase.Whether you want to take no hassle pictures or dig into all the settings available (which you don't have to) it really is a wonderful camera!There is so much more I could say but you're probably tired of reading by now. :0)PS. After owning the camera for a week I bought a nice Nikon neoprene case fitted just for this camera for $15 at Target that works like a charm!", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Travel perfect...........", "Author": "P.

While no slouch, I have not necessarily noticed that it is blazingly faster than my previous weapon of choice, the Fuji Finepix F30. I would estimate the average time at around 5 seconds-ish.While on the subject of speed, the auto-focus I find to be quite speedy. Obviously, the lower the light the more time it needs.Writing to card (in this case a Class 10 SanDisk 8GB) is decent, but could use a smidgen of improvement, especially since I'm using such expensive and high-performance storage media and still find myself waiting a couple of extra seconds to hit the view button.It has exceptional low-light capabilities while holding down graininess to a minimum as long as the subject is not in motion. The color is good, although to be fair I am not a shutterbug and my eyes glaze over as soon as talk turns technical on this point. I just know what I like when I see it, and this gives very good pictures for my taste.The menu system with thumbwheel operation is very much better than the aforementioned Fuji FinePix F-30 (which is just awful, in my opinion). You can generally find what you're looking for pretty quickly and toggle through the available selections.The included Li-ion battery lasts well, but here is where I must register the largest drawback from my personal perspective. You must physically remove the battery and insert it into a rather bulky external AC-fed battery charger. Other cameras of this type have the ability to charge the battery whilst connected via USB. I do not wish to carry around an artificially large collection of plastic and wires to charge the battery. This doesn't work well for carrying in my laptop bag, nor is it desirable for long-distance motorcycle trips, where packing space is at a premium, and AC power isn't guaranteed.I have given this product an overall satisfaction rating of \"3\". If not for the battery's inability to be recharged via USB (as noted above), my recommendation would have been a very strong \"4\".", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S620", "Author": "Avid Reader \"Nikon Shooter\"", "ReviewID": "R1KGZBKDVVPZRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Nikon D300 for my serious shooting, but often I just want something for in the pocket--especially when lugging around a DSLR and lenses is just not practical.

I wanted to replace it, but went ahead and read the reviews on the S620 and the S630. The S630 got pretty bad reviews, so I went with the S620. Huge mistake. I, frankly, HATE this camera. I've lost so many photo opportunities - my best friend as he said, \"I do\" for one - because this camera would not focus because the light was too weak, or too bright, or because the subject wasn't the exact right distance away, or because the wind was blowing in the wrong direction.  The camera simply will NOT focus if the conditions aren't ideal - I would say at least half of the photos I take are blurry because the camera was unable to focus. Simple portraits - a friend standing still in front of a fountain, sun high in the sky - come out blurry. I have NEVER had these types of issues with a camera, especially a Nikon. After owning and loving the S610, buying and attempting to use this camera has been a nightmare.

In hindsight, I wish we had re-bought that one.The \"Auto\" setting is guaranteed to produce blurry, yellow pictures in anything other than incandescent or natural light. If you have good lighting, then you get blurry pictures with vivid color. If you tinker with the manual settings, you can get a picture in non-natural lighting that is nice, but if you forget to change it in other settings, I.E. you're chasing your toddler inside and outside, then it wrecks all your other pictures. This completely defeats both the purpose of \"auto\" and the fact that we elected to spend extra on the camera because we're not professional photographers and don't want to be. If fluorescent bulbs were a concept invented last week then I'd be more forgiving, but come on Nikon,  they have been around for a very long time, learn to deal with them already.I'm not sure why the pictures are blurry, but it seems all the fancy steadying tech supposedly in this camera is junk. My 2-year-old $120 camera didn't have any of it and those pictures are much sharper (and properly white-balanced in \"auto\").Having spent more on this camera than on any camera prior and not being the sort of folks that just have $250 to burn, we were extremely cautious with it. After getting about 300 pictures on it, the shutter button is permanently stuck in the halfway point. If we really smash the button in all directions, it will eventually take a picture, but the effort in doing so results in even blurrier pictures than normal. I was tempted to hold off on the review until I found out how Nikon intends to treat us in the warranty department, but I'm assuming I'll at least have to pay shipping charges, and I'm not certain I want to spend even more money risking the possibility of bad customer service on a product I'm already experiencing serious buyer's remorse over.The battery pack is bittersweet. It lasts a pretty long time compared to the regular AAs from our last camera, but you can pick up AAs anywhere and they're comparatively cheap. For this, you either need to shell out a not insignificant chunk of change on a spare battery or take no pictures while the one you've got charges up. Overall, I think I'd rather have AAs than a battery pack, but I imagine that's personal preference.It is compact. However, so are most of the rocks my daughter picks up, and those are equally functional to this camera, less frustrating to operate, and free.Overall, buying this is an expensive way to get a cheap camera.

I primarily use the camera to take pictures of my son -- a toddler who is always on the move.  As such, I've always had to use an action/sports setting to capture him clearly.  The Nikon camera has this setting, but the shutter speed is too slow, and the flash cannot be enabled in this mode.  Every other mode I've tried produces blurry images.  Also, the red-eye reduction and face finder features typically cause my son to shut his eyes for every picture.  I have some lovely shots of him napping, but that's about it.  If you are shooting landscapes or other photos where your subjects will remain still, then this camera is probably fine.  However, I wouldn't recommend it for folks trying to photograph small children or animals.  Additionally, I've found the video mode to be disappointing as well.

I didn't even know cameras went that high (like I said, my other camera is 4 years old....I thought 5 megapixels was pretty decent)!!!I thought if it came in and was too difficult to use, I'd just foist it off on my husband and carry the old one.  Man...can I just say I'm glad I carried this camera.  I have the most amazing pictures; and I didn't even delve into all of the fancy settings.  It is so easy to use, and I am very pleased.  I used the \"nighttime\" setting, the \"sunset\", \"snow/beach\", and \"dusk/dawn\" settings, and the rest of the time it was on \"auto.\"  We did a side by side shot between the his/her cameras for a nighttime picture, and there was no comparison, my shot was clear and bright.  I also have a shot of our ship in port at dusk in Cozumel, the sunset is fading behind the ship and the lights are on all over the ship.  We were showing the photos to a friend and when he saw that picture, he asked what kind of lens and filter I had on my camera.  My response was, \"Uhhhh. Huh?\"  When I told him it was \"just a regular camera\", he wanted to look at it.  He didn't believe me that we didn't have some kind of color filter on it to pick up the sunset colors.  Now my husband wants his own.  Me and my bright ideas!!!

I have done lots of night time shots. However, it seems to always choose an aperture that makes bright light sources have rays around them.This camera even does pretty good with a flash but I try not to use one if I can help it.The speed is pretty good and it will burst up to 2fps at 12MP in bright sunlight.  The white balance is not always the best but it does have a setting that allows you to set custom white balance for a scene.  Snow tends to have a blue hue under most white balance settings though, especially at dusk or early morning.The camera's design and construction are good. I have dropped it several times and I almost always carry it in my pants pocket.  All of the exterior case screws have fallen out and the ends are held on with superglue.

The feel of the camera isn't cheap like many other cameras in the same price range.  The picture quality is always great.  Usually we just take pictures on the auto mode but the other manual picture settings have been useful from time to time.  The nightshot feature is very good at illuminating objects when you take low light pictures.  The downside to the nightshot setting is that you have to either hold the camera extremely still or set it on a stable surface or you will get blurry photos.  The screen is very large and makes it much easier to review your photos versus plugging the card into your computer and later seeing that the picture you took is not good.  That being said, the very large screen on the back is very easy to get fingerprints on since it occupies most of the space on the back of the camera.  The start up time is very quick.  Once you hit the \"On\" button the camera is ready to shoot a picture in less than 5 seconds.  Also, the zoom is very quick as well.The cameras stability feature is very good for leveling out normal hand shaking when taking pictures so on most of the settings (except nightshot) the picture turns out very clear and is rarely blurry.  The buttons are all well place and are very intuitive.  The rotating dial selector on the back of the camera makes it very quick and easy to move through all of the menu settings.  Instead of hitting one button over and over, you can instead rotate the button and more rapidly scroll through the selections on the screen.Overall, this is a fantastic camera for point and shoot applications.  It doesn't have the quality of an SLR camera but still produces great images for the rest of us.  It's size makes it very handy to carry in a pocket or in a purse.

Nowak \"Prophotoman\"", "ReviewID": "R1JR5KN4YQ8ZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for my brother who wanted a camera with vibration reduction technology, since his hands are at times a little unsteady. I myself am a professional photographer who uses strictly professional equipment.  I am impressed with the photo quality of a camera that costs less than 3% what my DSLR/pro lens combo does (over $5000).  No the images are not pro quality on this camera, HOWEVER, they are as good as what you can get on any 35mm point and shoot camera, and in most cases sharper than 35mm.What separates a point and shoot from a single DSLR body/lens combo that costs $5000 or more?  It's a LOT more than just money!  Shutter response time even on consumer level DSLR's is MUCH quicker than ANY point and shoot.  This is important for a professional who has to capture images NOW!  Timing is critical to the professional, especially sports photographers!  A good DSLR will give you almost instantanious shutter response, roughly about 1/80th of a second! whereas a point and shoot is always over one second.  My pro DSLR will take up to 8 frames per second in RAW 14 bit mode!  No point and shoot at this time can take more than two frames per second, most are less.  And that is in basic (low quality) JPEG mode!  There are many other differences such as lens quality, image sensor size, video noise, buffer size, etc.All that aside, this camera is perfect for taking family photos for prints of 8 x 10 size. The number of pixels a camera sensor has is not nearly as important as most people believe.  A tiny sensor with 12mp will not give as good a photo overall as a point and shoot with a larger 8 mp sensor.  It has to do with video noise and color separation.  The lens on this camera is pretty good.  It does give pretty sharp images up to about 11 x 14 in print size. Bigger than that and you start seeing what's called chromatic aberration in the print. Edges of the image contents appear to be slightly off color or multi-colored (kind of a rainbow effect).Overall, though, this camera's quality cannot be beat for the price!  Also a good choice for your older pre-teen who is showing some interest in photography.  This is a small camera in size, yet takes very good photographs.Joseph NowakNikonian Gold Member.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera at great price", "Author": "D.

Its smaller then my cell phone (Verizon LG ENV2) so you can pretty much take it anywhere without it being in the way.  All the pre-set modes are nice to play around with.  Its fast and the quality is pretty good for a point shoot camera that fits in your pocket.  Only downside i found so far was when i was at a wedding trying to take pictures of the slow dance in very low light from about 20 feet away.  It just couldnt quite get the focus right, even with them moving rather slow.  I flipped threw a few different modes including auto mode and they came out blurry every time.  So in situations like that, it might not be the best camera for the job.

I have a really great larger one but hardly ever take it because I don't like hauling it around. So Nikon has a great reputation, right?

So I went back to basics and just used the auto setting...still yellow and a lot are still blurry.
