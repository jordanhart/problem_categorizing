{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Pleased So Far!! 5 Stars For A Under $100 camera", "Author": "Rude Boy 1979 \"Ralph\"", "ReviewID": "RKLSCXD9V1BNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was scared to buy this seeing the one star reviews but I figured at the price ($79 on Amazon) I could give it away if I was not happy with it. I know a lot of poor people who would be very appreciative to get anything for free. I have now owned 6 digital cameras. The two being the ones that I used the most were a Canon 2 mp ultra compact one I bought about 8 years ago, and a Samsung 8 mp compact one I bought 4 years ago (Digimax i85 http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Digimax-Digital-Camera-Optical/dp/B000VQ8MB2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1324849121&sr;=8-4). The other 3 cameras I bought were too bulky and I gave them away to family pretty quickly.My general experience with digital cameras after 8 years of using them is they don't last forever. And usually when they break I'm angry that I spent $250 to $400 on it. So with that in my mind I wanted one under $150 with an optical zoom, compact size, and HD video (at least 720p). My Samsung broke on me while I was home on vacation (I work overseas and don't see my family much in person). I bought the Samsung based on a recommendation from the techy comedy news show called \"Attack Of The Show\" and they loved it. Well I hated that camera but I had a good amount invested in it so I kept it. I'm happy now that it broke because now I have a camera I really enjoy, this Kodak.The Kodak was much under $150 it was even cheaper then $100, so that was a easy pick. On top of it having an optical zoom, and HD 720p video, it has a rechargeable battery, a great bonus as I hate throw away batteries if I can avoid that. So I took the plunge and got it a week ago. I know I am in love with this camera because despite it being so inexpensive it's very very fast! This camera takes pictures the instant you click the shutter, I have never had a digital camera as fast as this one. The pictures so far have also been very sharp using the smart photo setting (everything auto). I also just tried out the video (720p) and it looks very sharp compared to my low resolution cameras before. Kodak provides a simple book with it and online a pdf book thats more detailed. They also have video instructions online which I thought were cool to watch and a help since I like to only turn on a camera and start shooting assuming it can do everything on its own.The camera can do editing and has instant sharing to your Facebook page but I am not interested in those features as I will crop the photos and such using my laptop, but they are there. And I can pop out the memory card and download the photos myself, but it's on there in case you like that. I really like that it has a film start button and a separate photo shoot button so you don't have to switch modes, that is the first camera that I've owned to do that, very easy to operate. The auto settings seem very good, they are called smart photo, and the camera really seems to be great in auto. I have not played with the sports modes or such but may as I gain experience with it. It seems to be doing a great job just on its own so I may never ever mess with the manual controls!Overall for a $79 camera I rate it a 5 out of 5, I may buy another one and keep it until this one breaks so that down the road I'll know I have another one of these around, I'm that happy with it. This is my first Kodak product and I always considered them low end because of the price and old Instamatic camera days, but hey, I'm a Kodak customer now, GOOD JOB!BTW I read when from anothjer review here, I was buying this, that it only took up to a 4gb card, the manual says it takes up to 32gb card so I'm bummed that I bought a smaller card then I wanted, so keep that in mind. Also one of the one star reviews talked about their daughters camera freezing up, the firmware upgrade on Kodak's site says that is there for a freezing issue, so that may have fixed it before it died. The other one star review was about one purchased on Ebay so possibly it was used and abused, who knows. Sometimes you get varying tolerances between the same model so maybe they just got lemons, maybe peoples expectations are too high for a under $100 camera, maybe people are trolls and are trying to kill Kodak from selling their products, who knows, I know I really like mine and wanted to share that with the Amazon community.5 out of 5, great camera for the price and really a great camera for something as compact as it is!", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Ruth P.H.", "ReviewID": "R3DOTX3GIT1QL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchase this camera about a week ago at Walmart.  I love this camera.  It may not be as fancy as a Sony or Canon but it works great. The pictures and videos are crystal clear.  I have taken photos and videos extensively of my grandchild and outside taking pics and video of my dog.I replaced my old camera that was also a Kodak but it was a 7 mp and the video was not very good.  I don't know why the other reviewers think the photos aren't clear but one thing you need to do is hold the shutter down part way before snapping the photo in order for the camera to focus.  I did extensive research on compact digital cameras, wanted to stay within a certain budget and also didn't like that some of the more expensive cameras only charged their batteryoff the computer.  This Kodak comes with an adapter that plugs in the wall to charge which is much more convenient.  I have used the share button once and it did send my video directly to Facebook.  I could not get it to send to my email but I think the video was too large.Overall this camera works great to me and I was happy I chose it.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I WON'T BUT THIS CAMERA AGAIN", "Author": "Jeanette PM", "ReviewID": "R1P1K6LGS5CPTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter who was graduating high school, bought this camera so that she would have a camera to use to document her last weeks in high school. We bought the camera at Walmart.A mere few days after she started using this, it froze on her a couple of times but she managed to do something to get it going again. I think she took the battery out then put it back in again to reset. We've had another Kodak digital camera in the past and it worked alright so that was one reason we bought this one, and because the price was within her budget.As far as the quality of photos, this is ok for everyday use, nothing fancy. If you're like my daughter and just use it for taking photos of your friends, then it will do. It does not take very good low light photos as she found out when she took the camera to a couple of concerts. Low light photos come out very grainy. The overall sharpness of the photos are less than the ones we take with a Canon point and shoot similar to this model. (Coolpix is a great model) Close up shots (macros) are not very good on this camera either. Compared with the Canon, the macro shots taken with this camera came out flat.Anyway, about a month after my daughter bought this camera, using it almost daily, the camera stopped working for her. When she tried to turn it on the lens would not come out. It was stuck. Rather than messing with it, I decided to send it back to Kodak since it was still within the one year manufacturer's warranty. I followed the instructions and sent the camera and accessories back to Kodak.I just received an email from Kodak this morning saying the warranty on this camera has been voided because they found \"sand damage inside the unit\". Now this is only after one month of normal use, albeit daily. The unit was not dropped nor buried in the sand. Whatever sand or dirt got in the unit is due to normal use. If they say there's sand damage, I can't argue with that. However, I think it sucks that the warranty is void because of that, AND that their repair costs are so ridiculously high!The offer they gave me is to repair the camera and I pay them $76.95 plus tax; return the broken camera to me with a $35 fee for them inspecting it and telling me I'm out of luck, or take advantage of their 'upgrade' program by giving me 15% discount on a new product. Whopee! eh?For the amount they're asking, I might as well buy a new digital camera!

It will not shoot pictures comparable to the latest Canon DSLR! But for sub $100 pocket cam it is very good. Also I am admittedly not a camera pro or anything close to it. I got this camera for my son on his 10th birthday, and he is thrilled with it. It has some nice features, some that we haven't even figured out yet. But I like the facial recognition on this cam. The controls are easy to use, and everything still works well after a couple months use.

Its easy to use, and it takes GREAT pictures! When i recently just broke my last camera from dropping it, i desperatly needed a new one, because as my friends say, im the \"queen of picture taking\" and i never leave the house without it. My most favorite quality on the camera, is you can take 4 pictures and it forms it into a photobooth picture, or filmstrip. The only thing i wish it could do would be turning the filmstrip to black and white, or sepia. but you can always do that on an editing site. It has scene modes, like; action picture, portrait, up close and lanscape and so on. and it also has, film effects like;kodacolor, ektachrome and kodachrome which are all different strengths of regular color and T-max, and tri-x which are different strength of black and white, and also has sepia.

But I did expect it to take clear, visible photos without a lot of hassle.  And I did expect this camera to be simple and easy to operate without having to carry a manual around with me (or in this case, my laptop or tablet computer because the \"extended manual\" is only online).  I am also fairly technologically savvy - I know my way around my electronics with ease and rarely have any difficulty figuring out how things work.That said, I have to say that I feel that I wasted my money with this camera.  Even with the added in accessories (camera pouch, charger, SD card, battery, USB cord), it wasn't worth the sixty $ I paid.  The camera takes photos that are unreliable at best.  When I attempted to take a photo of my sons playing in their band concert (a very well lit gymnasium and I wasn't more than 30 feet from them), I found I couldn't get a decent shot.  If I didn't use the flash, they were blurry because I couldn't hold the camera steady long enough (noone could without a tripod).  If I used the flash and just the very basic setting where the camera does it all, the picture was so dark I could barely see them.  My cell phone flash works better than that.The other annoying things are that I cannot figure out how to change the setting on how long the photo stays on the screen after you take it.  It seems like forever which not only wastes the battery, but causes you to miss shots while you're waiting for the camera to finish.  The menu is not very intuitive, it's very difficult to find the settings to change things like what type of lighting you're using, which ISO, etc.  Most cameras have this basic stuff easy to find (again, my cell phone camera does).Finally, I have very small hands for an adult.  I found this camera felt too small and it was difficult to push the button to take the photo - I often ended up turning the camera off or accidentally turning on the video recorder instead.I paid fifty-nine $ for this camera which included a neoprene case, USB cord, SD card, battery and wall charger.  I don't think it was worth that much - the accessories are worth more than the camera.  Maybe I'm just too frugal, but to me, that's a lot of money to spend on something that doesn't work.  Maybe others are able to give away $100 items if they don't like them, but I don't have that kind of throw-away money.  I'd value this camera at around $30 considering it only works under ideal conditions.All in all, I wish I had saved the money I spent on this camera and paid a little more for one that actually worked.  It might be appropriate for a young child (though not for this price). As far as photo quality goes, unless you're only going to take pictures of things that are not moving and are in bright sunlight, you're probably going to be disappointed.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R7WDWKLA90XR7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at Walmart for $99.00 including insurance and I love it.

I figure 12-15 hours is long enough for a Chargeable Battery.The ONLY GOOD POINT I Found...it that it does NOT need AA Batteries!!.Now it's THURSDAY, AUG 4th-THE NEXT DAY...& I'm on my way back to Walmart to get my $110.00 back.
