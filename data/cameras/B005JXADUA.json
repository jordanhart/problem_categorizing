The option to take both pictures and video is great. The quality overall for both pictures and video are very high. Overall, would recommend for people looking for it being convenient, but not looking for awesome video.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a nice little camera", "Author": "michael", "ReviewID": "R10Q1TXZJU9MC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am totally happy with this little camera. It works perfect as advertised. It is attached to my computer via the USB and gets charged at the same time. Can not get more convenient than that.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nowhere Near the Quality of a Flip Video", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R2GX0MZCOALY57", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my classroom to give my students more quality video capability than their cell phones.  And although this camera is easy to use and better than many phones, it is nowhere near the quality of even the oldest/cheapest $100 Flip Video camera.  If you have the extra money and looking for crisp videos, I would invest in a better video camera.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sound", "Author": "Michelle Mong", "ReviewID": "R2L2Y594JS1V2P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great for my video purposes, but the sound quality isn't great unless you're right on top of your subject with no background noise.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Video, So-so camera", "Author": "A P M \"Choosy Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R35CUX760ZBYSL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For a cheap camera, great buy.  For photos, not so much.  I'm not going to use it for photos at all, because I can hardly snap a good one.  A smart phone is perhaps better for both video and photos.  However, being what it is, I think I'll make good use of it for video.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera at an amazing low price!!!", "Author": "Willie Stylez", "ReviewID": "R7TKQ1K3MTWZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this camera for my 9YO daughter, and she ABSOLUTELY loves it! I like it because it was super cheap (only $25) and I don't have to worry about her (or her younger brother or nephew) breaking it. The only thing it's missing is a flash. Otherwise, the still picture quality is excellent for a 5MP cam. The zoom feature is pretty good. The video cam is fantastic! My daughter makes tons of videos and they are all clear and crisp. Low lighting produces grainy pics/vids but that is to be expected. Get this camera, it is well worth the money!", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "digital camera", "Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "R319GDLH54ZQBE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "They are functional, but not very hardy.
