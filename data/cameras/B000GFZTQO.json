The F20 (and its virtually identical sibling the F30) includes Fuji's 6th generation SuperCCD sensor that promises high sensitivity in low light conditions without the usual image noise associated with conventional digital camera sensors.  The F20's ISO range of 100-2000 turns out to be quite useable throughout the range.  I've taken hundreds of pictures in low light at ISO 800, 1600, and 2000 and the images are simply unmatched for their clarity, color fidelity, and lack of noise.  There is no other point-and-shoot camera that can hold a candle to the Fuji sensor's low light capabilities.  The noise \"grain\" at high ISOs has none of the multicolored pixels that dominate the high ISO images from competitive cameras.  In addition, the Fuji comes wrapped in a nice, solid body with good ergonomics and features for its small size.Prior to purchasing the F20, I've been using a Canon A610 (an excellent camera all around) and have been spoiled by the fine Canon image quality under normal lighting conditions (using ISO 50-200).  It's hard to beat the Canon in daylight using its low ISO settings.  When pushing the Canon to its ISO 400 limit, the images are very good but the multi-colored pixel noise is obvious if not distracting.  The Fuji F20, on the other hand, produces images at ISO 800 that are easily comparable to the Canon's ISO 400 and, in many cases, even its ISO 200 setting.  The Fuji can snap photos under low, natural lighting that the Canon can't even attempt without using its flash.  At normal print sizes, I find the F20's ISO 1600 images completely printable and useable.  Several professional reviews have compared the Fuji F20/F30 image quality at ISO 800/1600 against digital SLR output at similar ISOs and found the Fuji output to hold its own remarkably well.  Now that I've used the F20 in a variety of shooting conditions I can say that its low light output indeed sets a new industry benchmark.  The Fuji F20/F30 has opened up a whole new range of shooting modes that have simply not been possible without investing in high-end SLR equipment.For those who've been wondering whether to go for the F30 or save some dough with the F20, here's my take.  First, the F20 and F30 share the exact same 6MP sensor, processor, and lens.  There will be no difference in image quality between the two cameras.  What the F30 offers is aperture or shutter priority modes, a higher resolution LCD monitor, ISO 3200 instead of 2000, and a longer battery runtime.  However, the F30's pseudo-manual mode may only be marginally satisfying to those craving full manual control since, like most point-and-shoot digitals, the f-stops are limited by the zoom setting you've chosen.  I have seldom relied on using aperture or shutter priority modes in my point and shoot cameras since the program modes are excellent for most of my shots.  As for the LCD, I have compared the F20 and F30 side-by-side and there's little to differentiate them especially since the F20 includes a 153,000 pixel LCD that is already at a higher resolution than most other 2.5-inch screens on competitive cameras.  The LCD alone should not be the deciding factor.  Battery life is very good on the F20 and typical of most consumer cameras at about 250+ shots per charge; however, the F30 nearly doubles the capacity per a single charge and this can be significant for many users who don't wish to have a spare battery on hand.  Personally, I like to have a spare battery handy since I may not always have a full charge on the in-camera battery when I go shooting.  That's just my preference to safeguard against being totally stuck.  Finally, the F30 has an ISO 3200 at its top end compared to the F20's ISO 2000.  But nearly everyone is of the opinion that the F30's ISO 3200 is much less useable than the F20's ISO 2000 (and this may explain why Fuji reduced the F20 setting to something more realistic).  All the other controls such as ISO selection, focus modes, scene modes, LCD refresh rates, and low-light (\"anti-blur\" as Fuji likes to call it) are the same between the F20 and F30.  To summarize:  The F20 and F30 are identical cameras in terms of image quality.  The F30 comes at a competitive price with some nice additions (though not quite deal-breaking if image quality is your goal).  But the F20 value is simply remarkable and the price difference goes a long way towards buying you a 512 MB xD memory card and spare battery.There is very little to dislike about the F20.  Fuji's 6th generation sensor delivers on its promise for high ISO performance.  Some folks think that Fuji's color saturation is understated but I find it quite natural and more representative of the original scene.  The preference for enhanced color saturation is nothing new -people like \"better than real life\" colors and so many manufacturers boost the saturation in order to generate what the customer believes looks good.  To address this, the F20 provides a \"FujiChrome\" color setting to boost saturation but I find the Standard setting to be the most accurate.As for lens performance, I have found moderate amounts of purple fringing in the high contrast areas of some images.  I'm sure Fuji will eventually solve this problem as some other manufacturers have.  I have been impressed at how my Canon A610 is totally free of purple fringing at all focal lengths.  Keep in mind that this purple effect is usually only noticeable when you view the remote details of your images at full size on your computer screen.  You will seldom detect it in printed photos unless your prints are huge or highly cropped.  Focusing performance has been very good with only a few mis-focused shots in very low light settings with the flash disabled.  Nothing unusual here.On the controls front, Fuji has provided a good range of controls such as exposure compensation, multiple scene/low light modes, various flash modes, and an unbeatable ISO range.  There's a really neat mode called Natural+Flash that shoots your scene with and without flash with a single shutter press.  This ensures that you'll always get a good picture to choose from and you won't have to ask people to wait while you change camera modes.  Very, very clever.  I also find Fuji's menu system to be fast and logical to manipulate which is especially useful since most modes are accessed (quickly) through the menu system.Besides manual ISO settings, Fuji also includes a couple modes called AUTO (400) and AUTO (1600) that limits the highest ISO that the camera can select.  I really wish they would have thrown in an AUTO (800) setting since I have no problem allowing the F20 to select up to ISO 800 for just about any photo purpose.  Just remember to dial in -1/3 or -2/3 compensation if you'll be shooting in bright outdoors -you'll help avoid blown highlights that can never be recovered in pp.The only other minor issue is that Fuji is still sticking it out with xD memory while the rest of the world has virtually standardized on SD cards.  Not a major deal, but it will probably require you to buy an xD card (I had to) and possibly a new card reader if you're coming from a different brand camera.  I will probably buy the reader since I'm not fond of downloading images by plugging in the camera to my PC every time.  It would also be nice if Fuji included a separate battery charger instead of requiring the camera to be plugged in for charging.  But this is the concession for making this camera available at such a low price and so I won't blame Fuji for that.Having owned three Canon digital cameras (S10, A60, and A610) I thought long and hard about the switch to Fuji.  The Canons are superb cameras and you're hard pressed to get a bad image from them.  However, I've increasingly found that I prefer to shoot natural light/low light scenes without flash and it is under these conditions that the limitations of conventional imaging sensors become apparent.  This is where the F20 shines and I haven't found any competitive sensor technology that comes close.Fuji is poised to introduce some amazing cameras using this 6th generation sensor.  But they will need the commitment to make sure that their entire camera line-up performs well from the lowest model to the highest. Success can't be built on just one or two successful models amongst a line-up of average offerings.  This may well explain the success of Canon -every one of their cameras is a generally a high performer in its market segment.  If Fuji implements their remarkable new sensors across the board and standardizes on SD memory, just imagine the choices we'll have!  I applaud Fuji for bringing revolutionary CCD technology (that delivers on its promise) to the low-end market.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Right price, excellent quality for a point & shoot", "Author": "K. Nixon", "ReviewID": "RDL9OOPDR7K4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research, I decided on this F20 rather than the F30.  Buying the F20 saves approximately $100 or more and only had to give up:1) manual shutter and aperture priority (which I wouldn't use anyway in a basic point & shoot)2) some LCD screen resolution (which is still better than many other cameras and doesn't affect picture quality at all)3) some battery life (still takes approximatly 300 pics on one charge - plenty for me)I appreciate Fuji putting this version out allowing us to save a little money for features that we might not use or that might not matter much for the extra money.  Now I can take that savings and put toward a nice camcorder!The real selling point for me on this camera though was the picture quality!  The F30 (which this F20 is the same internally) is known for excellent low-light pics - giving great photo quality even at higher ISOs when pics usually begin to get 'fuzzy' (aka 'lots of noise').  And that was super important to me considering many pics are usually taken indoors anyway.  The ISO 800 quality for this camera is equivalent or better than ISO 400 pics of many other cameras in it's class/price point.Even when knocking the pic quality down to 3 mp, the detail and clarity of my first shots amazed me!  Just as expected, indoor shots came out excellent - the flash backfills really well.  And I found the controls easy to learn.  I really love this little camera, and I'm picky when it comes to my electronics.You will need to pick up an XD card though, as this camera doesn't have much internal memory.  I found the 1GB card on sale, but probably would have been just as satisfied with the 512 mb - especially since I will take lots of pics on the 3 mp setting for email purposes.", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent P/S alternative to the already superb F30", "Author": "R. Lee", "ReviewID": "R2V1M7L81PPUGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those on a budget and looking for a high-ISO capable compact digicam, this now available Fuji F20 does a wonderful job.  Fuji took the internal picture quality essentials of the highly-regarded F30 (arguably one of the best overall P/S compact digital cameras) and made a budget version in the F20.  This camera includes the same superb lens, low noise sensor and processor of the F30 while using a lower resolution (153K vs 230K) 2.5\" LCD screen and a smaller battery.  No shutter or aperature priority modes, either.I have spent two days with this camera and its sharpness, color rendition, and amazing low light capabilties are identical to the F30.  Resolution is high.  Colors are natural and not overly saturated (like many Canons and some Sonys).  For low light, non-flash photos, the least useful ISO3200 mode of the F30 has been limited to ISO2000 in the F20 which helps, though noise does start to creep in.  Bypassing the \"Anti-blur\" feature and simply using the auto ISO (up to ISO1600) keeps noise manageable and pics are very clean.  I have not yet noticed he much-discussed chroma problem -- aka purple fringing -- nor the tendency of the F30 to blow highlights in bright, contrasty outdoor scenes.Shutter response is excellent.  Handling is a bit different from the F30 -- noticeably lighter and the feel is not as substantial (it fits in my hands differently).  The lower resolution screen seems to have a more limited field of view and is not as clear as the F30, though images are bright.Overall, a great package for novices and advanced photographers needing a compact, affordable, well-designed camera that produces amazing results under varying conditions.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera for price range with a couple quirks.", "Author": "M. Hills \"Golden Retriever Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RBBJV8J0WYCXJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this camera and at it's current price it's hard to beat. There's been a lot said already but I think what it boils down to when choosing between the F20 and F30 is - do you want to pay more for a \"dial\" - more about that later.PROS (in order of importance to me)1. Excellent low light shots! I cannot emphasize this enough. But please don't compare it to a DSLR - that's simply not fair. I compared it to a Canon SD700 IS - I carried both for testing and took identical shots. The Fuji outperforms the Canon hands down in this department. The Fuji took clear shots inside libraries and museums using natural light which is specifically what I wanted. The Canon produced photos in natural light that were grainy and blurry. I prefer to use natural lighting as much as I can so this is probably the most important factor to me.2. Out of the box simplicity. I read somewhere someone saying this was not a good P&S.; I do not agree with that. My SO was visiting DC and the Baltimore area and I debated which camera to give him - the Canon or the Fuji. This is the most un-technical person I know - he still has trouble with the whole \"holding the shutter halfway down to focus\" on digital cameras. However, knowing he would be in museums, memorials, etc, I gave him the Fuji and made sure that after I played with it, it was all set back to auto. He came back with beautiful clear shots! Far nicer then anything he's been able to achieve with previous digital cameras. Most indoor photos used natural light and his flash and outdoor photos came out great - all set on AUTO.3. Nice size and solid construction. This is not a \"plastic\" camera like a couple others we have in our house that cost nearly the same. It's metal and feels solid in your hands. It's not as compact as others (like the Canon SD700) but actually for me, it's better. I don't have big hands at all, but some of the smaller cameras are just too small even for me. It's small enough for a pocket or purse.4. Lots of scene selections for when you want to experiment. This camera gives you a lot of pseudo-manual controls to play with but not like an SLR where you can adjust shutter/aperture. It gives you enough to experiment with and manipulate. Read the specs - I won't go into them all here except to say that the Natural/Flash mode is genius!Which leads me to CONS1. Nearly everything is menu driven. I find this cumbersome at times. I think I would be happier with the F30. But I was new to Fuji and didn't want to sink that much money into a camera brand that I was unfamiliar with so c'est la vie. Here's an example of how it's annoyed me: We're in the forest and I've gone thru the menus to select the macro setting - minimum 6 clicks in the menu system. I am taking closeups of some foliage when behind me, my golden retriever does something comical that I would have loved to take a picture of, but I don't even try the shot knowing that in macro mode, there's little hope of a good outcome and it would take too long to get it back in auto mode using the menu system. With the Canon, I could have quickly moved the external dial to AUTO and tried the shot. I know that this is a bit of an extreme example but I wanted to share it knowing that a lot of you, like myself, want to experiment with the scene selections but will also use AUTO. If you think you're going to use AUTO most of the time, then it's probably of little consequence to you. But you may want to consider the F30 for this reason. Now there *is* a button on the back called f-mode which is there to allow you to make some quick settings changes. It's basically a smaller selection menu which means you'd get your settings done quicker, but what Fuji chose to place in this shorter selection menu is befuddling to me. I can see the value of the ISO setting there but honestly, the other two settings are (IMO) dumb. Picture quality (choosing between Normal, Fine, and a few others) is something I usually set once and forget about. This belongs only in the longer more tedious menu selection. Same with the other selection - Finepix Color where you can choose Normal, Chroma, and B&W.; If I'm setting those I'm thinking about the shots - they don't need to be in the \"quick pick\" menu. I think Fuji should replace one of those with a quick pick setting that puts the camera in all auto mode. Maybe I just haven't found the way to do it - if there is a simple fast way to get into AUTO mode, then someone please tell me. One of the few external buttons is the anti-blur button and it is very handy.2. Like everyone else - I dislike the charging system. You can purchase a standalone charger however.3. xD card - everything else I have in life takes SD cards. My card reader doesn't read xD. A mild annoyance.4. I don't particularly like the slow zooming when in playback mode.5. Slower then other camaeras when deleting photos in camera and formatting the card.The rest - LCD quality, no optical viewfinder (the Canon has one but it is so tiny it's hardly worth it) the battery life, zoom, macro mode are all good enough - not spectacular on the F20, but not bad either. They really weren't much of a factor in my buying decision.All in all - I really like this camera and use it a lot. There are some annoying quirks but they simply don't overshadow the wonderful photos it produces - especially in low light when compared to other compact cameras.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply Marvelous!", "Author": "JAD \"TechMan\"", "ReviewID": "R1AYRQ2FGNB5DP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little champion wins best in class for compact all purpose camera.

Image quality is OK, just be sure to dial down the exposure compensation about -2/3 stop (in manual mode) on bright, sunny days- like a previous reviewer has noted. This camera does not hold shadow or highlight detail very well at all in high contrast scenes. I find I have to do a lot of post processing with photoshop to get the images up to par. Low light performance is very good as advertised however. It is a 'fast' camera; it powers on quickly, very little shutter lag - although the autofocus can be just a tad slow. Battery life is very good. The Manual mode and Anti-Blur mode seem a little gimmicky; it's not a true manual mode where you can control shutter/aperature combinations, just ISO and exp. compensation. Anti-Blur uses ISO 2000 to get a faster shutter speed, however, with the noise it is not very useful, I don't think.

At under $200 on Amazon and with a couple of gift certificates, the price was easy on the wallet.The performance was good. Without the image stabilization on I was able to take good daylight pictures but indoors the slightest movement caused some blurred shots. The image stabilizer seems to work adequately; although I did a comparison of indoor tripod shots without stabilization and hand-held with stabilization. The shots without were much crisper and more well-defined but the stabilized shots were very good but just didn't seem to have the same focus quality.Where this camera really earns its keep is in low light situations. I was shooting without flash in museum that did not allow flash photography and was amazed at the results that I got in very low light conditions. Noisy images were a problem when the light level was very low but I must say that with a certain minimum level of light the pictures were very good!Indoor flash photography leaves me wishing for a little better performance. The images are a bit washed out and the flash is not well diffused. My wife has the Canon SD800 IS and side-by-side comparisons of the flash photos shows quite a decided performance difference. Perhaps not a fair comparison given the Canon is twice the price but I think the Fuji should perform a bit better than it does.The speed of the camera is good and I never found myself waiting on the camera to take the next picture or come on.

About 6 months ago, my lens got stuck and the lens cover came off. No big deal. The camera still worked. Then, about a month ago it went completely dead. No big deal, I'm still under warranty. I went by the book, called for an RMA, and sent it in to their Edison, NJ repair center. About two weeks later I got a bill for over 75% the cost of replacing the camera. The estimate description reeks of a company trying to sidestep their warranty obligations. So, I call them. I soon reach the typical I-Deal-With-Angry-People-On-The-Phone-All-Day-Every-Day rep, and end up in one of those conversations where you are presumed guilty before you're even heard. Eventually, I am put on hold, and in the meantime apparently \"the manager\" has decided to give me leniency and cut the repair bill down to about 50% the cost of replacing the camera [mind you I never spoke to \"the manager\" and quite frankly if I were to find out it was one of those Seinfeld conversations where you're put on hold for a few minutes while someone has a fake conversation with \"the manager\" I wouldn't be the least bit surprised].Some things to bear in mind,1. I am a lifelong photography hobbyist, and did not abuse this camera in any way2. I packed it six ways from Sunday so that there could be no disputes with the USPS3.

IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY!I like Fuji's cameras, despite the stupid xD cards and I have enjoyed owning this camera. I don't know if any of the other manufacturers are any better about honoring their warranties, but HELL wouldn't it be refreshing if a company simply honored their warranty without argument or question? There are companies out there who do that. Fuji is categorically NOT one of them. I am not exaggerating when I state that I will not buy another Fuji camera EVER, simply on account of this experience. In fact, I am in the market for a digital camera as a gift this holiday season, and I will go with Canon or Sony or anybody else.

The flash does a fine job illuminating the subject without blowing them out, but I don't really use it all that much (strictly a personal prefrence).I knew before I purchased the F20 that there was no viewfinder, and that the LCD screen wasn't top of the line, so I don't feel it would be fair of me to say that these are \"negatives.\"  Sure, I would have liked a viewfinder and a super bright 3\" LCD that works in super bright sunlight, but in my mind that is not a realistic expectation from any $100-150 compact point and shoot camera.Overall, I am very happy with the F20 and would gladly recommend it to anyone.

It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The \"anti-shake\" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).

Buy it over the F30, F31.  I got mine in great condition - full package with cables and SW on a big auction site for $80.  The camera has the best low-light performance short of a DSLR and a fraction of the cost.  A huge advantage over a DSLR is that this camera, with its collapsing lens, truly is pocketable.  It has double the flash output and is perfectly fine at ISO 800.  The F30 gives you manual control.  You don't need it.  Aperture control is useful for DOF/bokeh effects.  You're not going to get that with any small sensor camera.  So it's not needed, aperture control is really irrelevant with compact digitals.  You can use this to control the shutter speed.  Manual folks want to keep shutter speed at a fixed 1/30 or 1/15th for low-light shooting without camera shake or too much motion blur, intentionally underexposing shots to easily correct later in their photo editing software. Shutter speed, can be controlled indirectly but nearly as accurately with the F20's +/- exposure control. Set it to -1, 1.5, 2 stops as appropriate. Shutter speed will increase to between 1/15-1/30 in most low light conditions, just like direct control over aperture.  So, save yourself some $$$ and get the F20 over the F30.Neglected is that the F20 makes an excellent natural-light indoor camcorder with its high ISO capabilities.  It's /better/ in a lot of ways than a camcorder.  Its resolution is beyond standard TV res and the key is its high ISO capabilities enables low light shooting without a blinding light attachment.  It captures at 30 discrete frames per second without scanning just like expensive pro digital cams intended for digital capture and film output. I'm waiting for some low-budget filmmaker to exploit this capability.  It has an excellent black and white mode that looks like real black and white film, a good \"punchier\" chrome mode, a very good macro mode, and a decent lens that's fast by modern standards with a F 2.8. It's flash is about 2X the output of most digicam flash units, and it has good battery life.  The auto flash mode is extremely accurate in addition to being powerful, accurately powering up or down based on distance to the subject.  Very well-done, Fuji. Only thing I wish it had was true optical image stabilization.  Alas, can't have everything...The Fuji Finepix F20 is - price included, a \"steal\". A brilliant product.

My assumption is it is dust on the inner lens, which I've never heard of happening with a digital camera. I don't feel like I used this one any differently than I had with my previous or new (Canon) digital camera. I might have been able to send it in to have it cleaned under warranty at the time, but it was too close to my vacation, and I didn't want to be without the camera. After vacation, it was too late.Additionally, Fujifilm does not make available for download the full software for their (very good) FinePix Viewer software, for offloading pictures onto your computer. I called about this and the solution the CSR gave me was to transfer the contents of the CD-ROM onto a jump drive and then install it. He then got into an argument with me after I told him that Fujifilm needed to get with the times and support netbooks, saying that the files would be too large for them to offer. Yeah right. I've downloaded 350 MB software from HP's site to run an all-in-one wireless printer, which is a lot more complicated than Fuji's little viewer.Not impressed with the FinePix's longevity or Fuji's customer service. My advice is to jump ship to Canon, as I did.*** end update ***After it became painfully apparent that my old digital camera had been passed by smaller, faster, better ones, I decided I needed to buy a new one.I knew I wanted something that worked well in low light, and this one more than delivered. Since I bought it, I've consistently been the one not using flash when everyone else is, and the pictures turn out better with natural light. It's ready to go quickly -- turn it on and within seconds the lens is out and the camera is ready to go. It takes pictures quickly, too, even when using the flash.The other thing that impressed me about the camera is how easy it is to use. The menus are intuitive, and I've hardly had to touch the manual aside from putting the memory card in. Battery life is good, too -- it goes hundreds of pictures on a charge -- and after all the AA batteries my old camera ate, the rechargeable battery is refreshing.I'm a point-and-shoot person, so I don't profess to know enormous amounts about digital cameras or photography, so I can't speak to any shortcomings of the more advanced features. It does seem to go red eye a lot when I do have to use the flash, but fortunately the light has to be extremely low for that.Overall the camera has been outstanding so far.

I tested it prior to giving it to make sure all was OK. Being familiar with Fuji digital cameras (ours is also a Fuji) it was quick and easy to start using without reading the manual. It is significantly smaller than ours yet feels very solid and well built. One nice improvement over ours it the placement of the On/Off button. Now it is all but impossible to hit this by accident. Focus is fast, recycle time is quick and if there isn't a mode to suit your situation (like, 14 of them) then you can do some serious manual work instead. I have used the FinePix software in the past and it was also nice. Now we use iPhoto on a Mac and life is REALLY simple. My only suggestion for anyone buying this camera or any digital camera is buy 2 memory cards in place of 1 huge card and if the battery is a Lithium Ion type, get a spare battery and external charger. This way you are always ready to go for even extended periods away from power. The 2 memory cards help if, for some reason one gets damaged, you have a backup. We have had memory cards go bad so at least you would have a decent sized backup. We purchased 2- 512MB XD cards because of this. Typically we shoot at about 2 resolution settings down from best. This yields over 500 photos per 512MB card! At this resolution the quality is good enough for prints and there is enough data for your photo editing software to make necessary corrections and improvements.

The flash is not overwhelming at close range, and it really does a fantastic job at taking pics without a flash under relatively low light, such as around dusk. Pics in general have very good color balance under various conditions.The main functional weaknesses are that it's rather user-unfriendly compared to other cameras I've used, requires an expensive battery and memory card, and has a lousy macro mode: about 4-6\" is as close as you can get.  Particularly annoying is the location of buttons such that it is difficult to avoid inadvertently changing settings.So it performs well, but I have to wonder about the quality of its manufacture and its durability.  Crapping out in 3 weeks is not good; trying to weasel out of the warranty is even worse. If you still want to buy this camera, get a store warranty or use a credit card that provides extended warranty coverage automatically.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "As Advertised", "Author": "S.

Firstly, the camera comes with a special Fujifilm battery, so if you forget your charger when you're away from home for a while, you're going to run into problems.

Boy am I glad that I waited for this gem of a camera to arrive.  I have used Fuji Digital before at about the 1.3 mega pixel range and was realatively impressed with the shots that came out of it but was always looking for a better camera to handle low light situations.  Look through quite a few cameras in the DSLR range, but alas, I don't own a hedge fund or private equity firm that would afford me the cash to actually purchase one!  Nothing else left to do but to go to my favorite links: Dave's Pick List and Steve's Digicams.  I have enjoyed Digital potography since my body suffered a Major Stroke; cause it gives me visual work to stimulate my affected brain areas, especially with the software and I needed aroun 5-6 mega pixels for cropping purposes.This camera is just what the Doctor ordered, so to speak, it went on my trip back to Ohio with me from Phoenix for a 28 year reunions with a couple of musicians that I worked with in the late 70's early 80's for personal around town shots, If I can figure out how to include a few of those shots in here I will.Fairly simple to use even with someone like me who has traumatic brain injury, I like the way it handles and I have the 1 gig memory.  The photographs in low light and daylight are impressive to me and I have shot only at the 3mp range so far.  I am happy as hell with this camera.  To borrow a phrse from one of the other reviewrs who brought it into their review, it is an excellent 'PHD (push here dummy)' camera, I would have to agree.The quality of the pictures at ISO 800 are far better than cameras I have tried at ISO 400 on those points others have mentioned I would have to share consensus with also.  The only thing that really 'bugs' me about the camera is the charging port/download compartment---Fuji---Come on---You could have come up with a much better flip cover for that, with all the brains in your corporation, that was a cheap shot, so I hope you have a future cover for it when the one on mine breaks at some point.Nice feel to the camera, charges fairly quickly, I am happy as heck about this camera.  Yes I would buy it again, although I might try the newer ones (F30 etc) when they get control of the noise on the higher ISO settings.  Can't go wrong with the purchase of an F20.  I would have to say Dave's Picks and Steve's Digicams were clear and informative in leading to my selection of this camera and boy they are right on the mark, other than going to see some of the other cameras that were so much smaller, this one is comfortable in the my hand.Do Yourself a favor and get a case for this one, it deserves it. Cause you are going to want to have access to it throughout the day and night.  Only other down side I have with it is thatI wish FUJIFILM would have included some drivers for it to be used as a webcam cause the clarity of this camera is phenomenal.  You need anything better?

But when I compare it to canon's and nikon's P@S cameras, this one is indeed excellent performer in low light, but again, comparing with p@s digital cameras.  If your subject, person or whatever you are taking picture from is still as a stone and your hands as steady and sharpshooters hands-you will take good picture even on ISO1600, but otherwise it is going to be blur multiplicated on noise.  Again I did all of my shooting in horrible poor light conditions, in order, to see how it perform without flash-it performed better than Canon's and Nikon's point and shoot digital, but didn't outperformed my Nikon D50.  I suspect this camera will do fine in good light condition.  One more thing, this camera appears to have higher ratio of compression of JPEG image files, which make it pretty much useless when you want to sharpen it in image manipulating software, on the other hand the noise this camera produce is much more pleasant to the eye, it looks like painting of French impressionists.  So, my verdict is this: buy it as supplement to your DSLR if you need it-but remember this camera isn't what Leica M camera used to be for film SLR cameras.Update:  1.22.2007Still good for outdoor shooting.  Indoor pictures getting worse and worse.  You should always spotmeter while photographing people in poor light condition, never use cameras matrix meter.  You can't believe camera's monitor-it always shows picture in better, means brighter condition than they are eventually appers at photographs.  I don't know after using Nikon D50 it's hard very hard, quality is just not there.  Still better than Nikon's and Canon's P@S I used to use.  I short, don't expect miracles with this apparatus, it will get you buy but never ever ever will come even close to your respectful DSLR.

I just packed it up and shipped it to Fuji to repair the front lens cover, which either stays half closed with the lens extended or half open with the lens closed, depending on how you look at it. Either way, cannot take pictures with it anymore.After only a month and a half of ownership, I'm not happy about this. Even if Fuji fixes it under warranty at no charge, I have no use of the camera while they do so, and I had to pay to ship it to them insured, with UPS. Adding that cost to the camera alone, I could have bought a more fully featured model from a competing manufacturer.Maybe I'm spoiled, but I've had a ton of digital cameras since the first floppy Sony Mavicas debuted back in the dark ages.

This is why I feel so: when I load a pic from it into Photoshop, and apply standard adjustments like Auto Levels, Auto Color etc, there is no difference. In other words, the camera already did that on the image, it seems; whereas with my Sony V1 (old reliable horse), I can apply those adjustments. I don't think this is bad necessarily but just am curious if anyone knows this for a fact (that F20 indeed does some default post-processing on the image).", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Totally Non-Functional", "Author": "Syracuse Pete", "ReviewID": "R5G52N3C5DH6H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Refurbished Camera just arrived.Gives a \"focus\" error.

Stumbled on this neat little camera and was blown away by the feature set. Ended up buying two - the other was for me since I was looking for a decent smaller camera to take with me on my frequent business trips.After 3 weeks, I finally returned it. I tried to reconcile the fact that it was such a good deal but I just didn't think it met Fuji standards. I think they simply crammed all sorts of features you typically see in much higher end cameras but didn't really maintain the same quality levels.  I own a Fuji A400 and a more sophisticated S5100 as well as a couple of nice Olympus cameras and really expected more.The LCD screen is misleading because photos look decent there but wait until you see them on a full size computer screen.The best shots are made using the AUTO mode without zoom and taken in bright daylight.The things that bugged me the most were the zoom, both optical and digital (too blurry), the proprietary battery (many Fuji's use AAs which are easy to find in a pinch), mandatory software to transfer fotos (majority of digital cameras are recognized as an external device and behave just like an external drive for easy transfer), and the lack of a view finder which would overcome difficulty in seeing the LCD in bright conditions.The features that I really liked are many.  Here's a few worth mentioning. Remember, these are extremely rare in a pocket size camera.  First are the super cool variety of shooting modes especially the \"Natural &\" which takes two shots in sequence, one with and one without flash (really handy when pesky shadows are around).  I also had never seen continuous shooting mode options in a small camera.  That's the best way to capture subjects that are ever changing like kids playing, animals, or sports.  It also helps to be able to change resolution settings with several to choose from topping off with 6 megapixel.This is a decent starter-trainig camera that will teach a novice how to use many features that are common in more upscale cameras when it comes time to upgrade. Casual users who can tolerate photo quality comparable to disposable cameras will probably not notice any difference.So I would give it to a first time digital user who has limited camera experience. The features are fun to use - just don't expect award winning photos.", "Date": "May 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "I think there's some hysteria going on here.", "Author": "T.

It fires up in a split second eager to take pictures. But it's low light performance is being exaggerated. It's not the camera's fault really, they put a restrictor plate on it. It's true that the F20 has the same guts as it's bigger brother F30, but the F30 has much more horsepower, and the reason why? MANUAL CONTROLS. You simply cannot take advantage of the high ISO's without some shutter control. If this isn't your bag, then you should be okay.
