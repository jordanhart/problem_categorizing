{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great little camera that blows you away!", "Author": "The Big RG", "ReviewID": "R26JVAF004EORV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a new digital camera fast in order to beat the deadline for an online video contest recently.  Previously I had owned the Kodak EasyShare Z1275 model which cost me just under $200 three years ago.  Money was tight and so I didn't want to spend that kind of cash.  So I decided between two models: this one and another Kodak EasyShare listed at $104.  In the end I went with this model, the C142 and I shudder to think if I hadn't.This little camera with the small price just blew me away.  Not only does it take high quality video but the pictures are even better than my old Kodak $200 model!  I wasn't expecting that.  The photos this camera takes are absolutely gorgeous!  Even if you take a shot of your garbage can the picture is gorgeous!!The camera takes double AA batteries, has a thingie on the bottom for mounting a tripod on, a beautiful LCD screen to view your pictures and video with, a slot for an SD card, a flash, a self-timer that goes up to 10 seconds, auto focus, a review of all your shots, and best of all a feature that allows you to easily share/transfer your pictures and videos to YouTube and other social networking sites (Facebook I think).  Email as well I believe.  On screen directions are in various languages when you first turn your camera on, there's a time and date stamp, and much more.When you're ready to transfer your photos and videos to your computer all you do is plug  it in using the USB cable/plug that comes with it and instantly the software appears on your screen for use.  There is no software disc included -- it's already in the camera every time you transfer.  An important note.  You will need QuickTime to view your videos after they're transfered.  And, yes, sound is included on your video but only available on playback.  The camera has no speaker.  Volume is adjustable but I find it to be just right.  Great sound!How Kodak can afford to put out a digital camera like this with such a small price tag is beyond me.  But I have one and that's all that matters. I got the blue color and it looks like a much more expensive camera.I wish I could afford to buy another one as I would just give it away to my favorite person.  You won't be disappointed with this baby.  I highly recommend!", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!!!!", "Author": "book luvin' sistergirl", "ReviewID": "R55J7ESWTMW4M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to take pictures at the family reunion that took place over the weekend. I was in a hurry for a new camera, my old one still worked, but I knew that there was more to be had with the new digital cameras, so I ran to my favorite online store Amazon and took a look at the cameras that were available for under $100 dollars there were so many I had to rethink price and go for a name brand and Kodak is always one that comes to mind because it has been around for so long.  I choose the C142 because the price and the ability to put in on facebook right away. It has been a great purchase the pictures come out clear, even when I was talking, walking, eating and taking pictures at the same time. You can never say that I can't multitask, I had no trouble with getting the pictures that I was trying to take and uploading them was a breeze.  If you are looking for a good camera try this one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the user friendly features of this camera.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just OK", "Author": "La Yoyis", "ReviewID": "R1QFRA1968RY9Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this camera two monts ago for our 11 year old son who right now is pretty much into LEGO stop motion movies. He is more than happy with it and the excitement hasn't worn out like it would had happened with a toy. The camera really does all what long description given at Amazon says but only when used in ideal-normal conditions like a sunny day. In this conditions, the pictures are exceptionally good for the low price. However, the functions of the camera are limited. For example, we were in a restaurant and there was enough illumination to take the picutres without flash but incandecent light made the pictures look orange. Every camera I know has a fuction to compensate this but this camera simply doesn't have it. For my kid, this camera is excellent but I wouldn't use it as my family camera.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Kodak C142 Digital Camera (blue)", "Author": "David J.

I wanted a small point-and-shoot camera with features I actually need and will use. The Kodak C142 is perfect.The Smart Capture mode makes taking great pictures every time a reality.  Open the box, pop in the batteries and memory card (not supplied with the camera) turn it on and click away.I tried to \"fool\" the camera with tricky situations, it has never failed. From 6 inches to infinity, this camera takes tack-sharp pictures you will be proud to share! Sharing has never been easier.  You can send pictures or video directly from the camera to many different applications such as flickr, Kodak Gallery, facebook and YouTube very easily. You can even set the camera to send email by typing in email addresses on the screen with the multifunction buttons.  Take a picture, want to send it to facebook, while reviewing the picture press \"share\" and choose facebook. All the rest is done for you automatically when you link the camera to your computer.Even setting the time on the camera is done automatically when you link the camera to your computer.  Kodak has done it right with the C142!Who would I recommend this camera for?  Everyone, young adults, technology challenged people, people who want great pictures with no fuss, and advanced photographers who want more control over the picture taking process.  The auto focus is spectacular! I framed my dog in the focus area, as she walked around in the frame, the focus area followed her...  another perfect shot!If you are thinking about buying a camera and this model is in the running... buy it!

If someone were to ask me if this camera was worth my money I would say definitely worth it and maybe more... photography is one of my greatest hobbies and I have a 5 yr old I can never get enough pictures of and yes I absolutely do love this camera... it's also lightweight and fits snuggly in my purse without taking up a ton of space.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Product, Outstanding Price!!", "Author": "K MavAZ", "ReviewID": "R2FT0PEKT380VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product last week at a famous \"Diehard\" walk-in store, going back today to price match Amazon's price, its the lowest I have seen and I have done hours of research on this!!!You will love this camera for the price and the quality is superior.

I have gone on a few trips with it,and it has proven to be a decent camera. I only have a few complaints.  First one that annoys me the most is the fact that there is no option to keep the date on all the time,you have to do it one by one after you take the photo! The video quality is really bad in some conditions. If you don't have a ton of light it becomes very grainy. The camera does lock up,especially when the battery life is running out. I also found out the camera goes hay-wire if you put cheap batteries in it. Literally it changed the colour of the photos,made them yellow. Also it started to refuse taking photos. :( But there are some good qualities about this camera. It is a decent camera for around 70 dollars.

It worked for a little over a week (probably would've been sooner had I used it more often, instead of taking a few pictures and putting it up.) before the darn thing powered off suddenly w/ the zoom lense stuck out like a tired dog w/ it's tongue hung out. I thought since it was Kodak it'd last for the long haul, dispate some of the reviews I'd read. A few of them said the same thing happened to them, but I thought maybe those occurances were flukes. WRONG!!!. The battery life is a joke, from day two it was showing that the battery was almost dead. I hadn't really taken more than 8 or 9 pictures at that point. So you can imagine my surprise. But still I pressed on. I noticed that you have to fiddle and fool around w/ it a bit to get a good picture. Which was fine cause once you start getting the hang of it the pictures come out pretty decient, some of them anyways. However, the memory is a joke, I could never get the video to work, and the editing takes a rocket scientist to work. It would've been nice if some instructions were included w/ the thing. But I guess they figure why bother. Save the money and time including this and just let em fiddle around w/ it till they figure it out. I hate to say it, but Kodak isn't what it used to be. My mom has one of their old cameras from wayyy back in the day. That thing can really take a licking and keep on ticking. It's been dropped, gotten wet,... you name it and it still looks new and works great. Too bad companies are all for quantity and profit over quality these days. But in all fairness, my niece has the exact same camera and from what I've heard she's not had any problems w/ hers. But If you asked me I think the fact that her's is still working is the fluke rather then the fact that mine stopped.

This camera was the biggest disappointment I have ever had with Amazon!  Huge disappointment!  I bought this as a gift for my grandson's birthday.  It only allows 4 pictures for internal memory - luckily I also bought the sd card.  Now it keeps shutting off and he cannot use it at all.  His birthday was June 30th.  I just found out I cannot return for a full refund as my time period elapsed June 29th.  We tried to use it last night for Fourth of July and could not even use it for one picture!  This experience has changed how I view Kodak and even Amazon.  I am a Prime Amazon member who places multiple orders every month and have almost always been happy and satisfied, but the lack of assistance on returning a defective product really makes me wonder about future purchases!  I cannot express how upset I am over this camera and worse is that it was a gift!", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "PAULINE A (HAYWARD)INDIHAR-GOBLE", "ReviewID": "R1FQMUIP486P7J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just bought a Kodak C142,I previously owned an older model Kodak c330 4mpthought I would get better and not at all this new camera is hard to figure out and my screen is all fuzzy but the picture comes out ok some pictures come out blurry even tho I put it on the setting to reduce blurrinessnot  happy with it at all", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "D.
