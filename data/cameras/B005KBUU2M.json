{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Looks cheaper than other Kodak EasyShare units...", "Author": "Nyxdia", "ReviewID": "R3P2YI3PYLJAES", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is offered at a great price on Amazon, really hard to beat. However, I've owned other EasyShare units and this one feels cheaper than most of them. It's kind of too light, almost as if it was made of low quality plastic. Also, you cannot store *any* pictures until you insert a memory card - other models will allow you to store at least a few pics. But most of all, what bothered me is that this model doesn't allow it to be used with a wall outlet charging device - batteries are the only option. So, you'll end up spending more money purchasing batteries in the long run.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy camera", "Author": "Terry DiBenedetto", "ReviewID": "R2NGEWHRV12ZXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good for children ....my grandchildren love this camera and it is very easy to use ..I would recommend this camera", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Kimberly P.

Comes with Kodak photo CD and a USB, making sharing pictures a jiffy. 12 MP are more than enough for crystal clear pictures. Saving pics on computer or uploading to social media sites also easy using the USB cable. Overall, very pleased with the camera and the price. Totally worth it.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thanks", "Author": "Geofrey Nyombi", "ReviewID": "R26DC2TEZ7CN2S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Its old than I thought, So I would recommend in the future Try to be more clear as we buy things as per your guidance", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$74.59", "Features": null, "Name": "Kodak EasyShare CD24 12MP Digital Camera - Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419DEfVXVqL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005KBUU2M"}}
