A .exe camera set-up file.  This will allow you to set the local date and time and a few simple camera settings.  Outdoor/or indoor lighting?  Compensates for fluorescent lights, incandescent or none (outdoors).  Low light on/off?  This is so it doesn't take pictures in complete darkness.  It also allows for one custom time interval for time lapse picture taking.  NOTE:  You can't use a Mac to tweak a .exe file (without running windows on a Mac).2.  A simple video viewer program to view the time lapse video created by the camera.  The camera creates .avi format files.  They can be viewed on a PC using the Brinno program.  It will also allow you to move through the video file one still picture at a time.  I haven't figured out how to take one or several still pictures out of the .avi file for use as separate pictures.  You don't have to use the Brinno software to view the .avi file.  Almost any program capable of viewing video files should work.  Quicktime works too.NOTE:  Each time you turn the camera on/off it will create a separate .avi time lapse video.  This means that you will need to be familiar with how to use a video editing software program to combine the files into one longer/complete video.  This is important if you are planning on a long project (home construction).  I'm currently practicing with iMovie to combine the .avi files, adjust timing, add music, trailers, etc.  It is simple to move the files from the flash drive via Mac/Finder or Windows/Explorer.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not impressed for the price", "Author": "Southern Gent \"S.G.\"", "ReviewID": "R2E0XO3QUM3HM1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Update 2/26/13I would not recommend this product IF you appreciate good design leading to good output. The camera does what it was intended to do, mostly, but it is not an easy path the user must take to get there. For example, the lack of a viewfinder makes framing the scene a hit-and-miss proposition as you must set it up, take a shot or two, review the shots, set it back up, wash, rinse repeat. Also, to change the rate at which shots are taken means you have to take off the back cover, remove the USB stick and use a thumbwheel; or plug the USB stick into your computer and have the software set the rate. Even then you have to move the thumbwheel to the \"custom\" setting, replace the USB stick and mount the rear cover, and THEN turn it back on. Finally, as I noted before, it is sometimes difficult to know whether you even turned the camera on and it is taking shots. More than once I was disappointed to discover that there was nothing on the USB stick. I'm just not impressed with this product AT THE PRICED I BOUGHT IT. If it were $50 then I could more easily forgive poor design. I\"m dropping this item from 3 stars to 2.I literally just got it out of the box, set it up and it's now (hopefully) recording. That was all very easy and I think they did a great job of packaging and including the batteries and USB stick. However, see a couple of design flaws:1. No viewfinder. As someone mentioned in another review, this might be a serious limitation. I've got an idea of what I'm capturing but there's no way to know until I grab the USB stick and plug it into my laptop. We'll see if this is a fatal flaw.2. There's no way to know (that I know of) if it's actually recording. It would be nice to have it beep or make some noise or something. As it is now, I have it set on my office's window sill pointing out to the forest so I have no way of seeing the LED on the front. I guess I'll find out in a few minutes.I will update this review as I gain more experience with it. I hope it's a good replacement for my DSLR as I hate to \"waste frames\" doing time lapse with it and an intervalometer.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera and easy to use!", "Author": "cheryl terry", "ReviewID": "R1FCMSRE2W0VKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently purchased this camera to create a time lapse video of our house being built. Right out of the box, it was very simple to use. It only took a couple minutes to take our first photos. The software was just as easy, so viewing our first attempt was also user friendly.

Overall worked great once everything was set up.  As others have said, it doesn't have a viewfinder so you have to set it in a location, let it record for a while, then review to see if you like the position.  The quality of the video was excellent given the price of the camera.  I viewed the video on a 55\" HD TV and it was great quality -- 4:3 ratio only, no 16:9 option, but for the price you can't have everything.Battery life was okay.  I set it to take a shot every 12 seconds which turns into 1 hour real time in 15 seconds play time.  Batteries lasted for one week of daytime recording which was fairly convenient as far as battery replacement goes.Pros:  Price, quality of video, ease of programming, standing up to weather, standard AA batteries used.Cons:  No viewfinder (set up, record, view to see if you have the location right), hard to see if camera is on during the day (green light is very dim and beeps are hard to hear outside).Would definitely recommend as a value time lapse camera as long as you spend the pre-time before you actually want to record to set the camera up.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is a lot bigger that it looks.

You can use it for that but unlike a trail cam these have to trigger feature.To date I have collected time-lapse video of my property, plants, assorted creatures, house construction, and security since 2009.Great fun and excellent as a learning tool.Rechargeable batteries are NOT a good choice. Fresh alkaline or lithium work best.One important note. If you set the low light option, and set the time wrong and it may only make exposures at night. I have had some wonderful night shots of total darkness!.The camera body is virtually weather proof.
