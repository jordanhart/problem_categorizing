Personally, I think this is a mistake, butas a result, I purchased 3 of the 4 models available.The three main differences are that the on/off switch has been replaced with a lever, as has the zoom button. There is no longer a view finder as well, so you must become accustomed to using the LCD screen, as some do anyway. Overall the performance has been excellent as the 26x zoom is powerful and the 16MP pics both wide angle and telephoto are clear, crisp, and detailed. I have also shot 346 pics without charging the original Kodak batteries (included). This is Kodak's best effort thus far. I hate to see them go. I've purchased at least a dozen of their cameras over the years! Get a Z5120 before they are gone for good!", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Caroline H. Nesbitt \"sealionne\"", "ReviewID": "R100AN2ODOABVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For under $200, this camera is a great value in a super accessorized point & shoot camera with really nice features. The 20x zoom is incredible - I have used it extensively & though it is a little difficult to stabilize & focus at full stretch, the photos are still remarkably clean. The sweet spot for the zoom is, I would say, from 50% to 75% extended for very sharp, nicely framed shots. It was for this that I bought the camera, really, but I have been very impressed with its overall performance in all sorts of conditions & couldn't be more pleased. An ideal camera for a person who is either not ready to step up to a dslr or (like me) who is stepping back to something that is a bit more portable & a bit less fussy. And hey. As a person who loves bling - the cranberry color rocks.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare Z5120 Digital Camera- cramberry", "Author": "suzzy", "ReviewID": "R2RBFWAXO84NBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best camera yet!. Although I am concerned with the battery cover that requires a bit of paitence... you can not load the batteries or the memory card and close the cover fast. I find myself having to put the camera down and make sure I dont cram it into the slots. But other than that, I love the large view screen, and the easyness of using the buttons, and its set up like a regular 35 milimeter camera.  If your want a camera that has weight to it, this is the one, it will not fly our of your hands by accident.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "FABULOUS", "Author": "Amber lover", "ReviewID": "R11IJE44QYN9XZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Kodak cameras and this is a great one. I have had other cameras like the famous Nikon and Kodak beats them by far.  I wish Kodak cameras of this quality was easier to find. The only thing missing from the new package was the camera strap.  However, I used the camera all weekend long and it was wonderful. On Monday I will call Kodak for the strap.  Over all my satisfaction of this camera is extremely high.  I would buy more soon.

Seems to me most cameras in this price range have a real issue with light levels, you have to get enough light in the frame for a good picture.Anyways, I have been obsessed with the \"slow\" speeds at which the shots are processed/previewed, etc.  Since this camera does not have a real Sports/multi-shot mode, it is important to reduce time shot-to-shot any way you can (other than dropping the rez).I have tried 3 brands of cards so far, all 32GB.  Adata, PQI, and Sandisk Extreme Pro, all \"class 10\".  The Adata card was fairly slow, slowing down as more images were retained on the card.  PQI is somewhat better, but Sandisk (newly obtained as of this writing) blows them away completely.  It has cut down the lag times so much, I actually feel that this is the 21st century, not the 19th ;)  Down from up to 10-11 seconds of processing time, to 1-2.  Not bad at all!  Maybe the cheaper Sandisk card could work just as well, but I like to have some \"future-proofing\".Now all I have to do is get a good tripod to maximize the camera's potential ...", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Joyce B. \"Joyce B.\"", "ReviewID": "R3MHLE8L509NS9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to order this as I love Kodak even though I also have a Canon and Sony. At first I was less than impressed. However the more I used the camera and different effects and the P mode I began to love it. It is very easy to use the video feature. Plus I love the fact it is compact and not black!!! I believe Kodak was getting it right and I am sorry they aren't  going to be making more cameras. I am thinking of purchasing the z990 now just \"because\".  Planning to take it on a cruise through the panama canal due to the ease of video. Give this little guy a chance...From someone who has  and lovingly uses a Canon g12, I can tell you this little guy is easy to use and can take some great photos!!!.  And it does a great job on macro and super macro!!!  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I still love my Canon best...but for ease of use this is a winner.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its a great product", "Author": "ARob", "ReviewID": "RO12MXA5KCHZ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera has an outstanding zoom lens, nice picture, great when taking video and doing zoom. The IS its a little slow when doing zoom. the camera does not have the option for multiple picture taken, I'm not referring to the panoramic view. Is also slow in responding to get ready to take another picture.The product does not include a strap or a minimum GB SD card memory.Overall its a great camera for a low price, recommended, for those stating in photography.Can any one let me know if there are filter kits as well as option to add Zoom lens to this camera?RegardsAROB", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "james gillespie", "ReviewID": "R2GGI9IB16WOF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Real good camera,love the distant it covers.

I just wanted a camera that is easy to use and takes amazing looking pictures.  I owned a Kodak Easy Share a long time ago and switched to a Canon but wasnt thrilled about it so I deceided to go with another Easy Share. Im glad I did.

The only drawbacks I have found are the slow processing speed and the awkward battery/memory card cover.  I've taken _a lot_ of photos with this camera and have been mostly pleased with the results.  Just took my niece's graduation photos and I have had people say \"Wow, you must have a pretty expensive camera.\"  The clarity is about as good as a film camera (which I still prefer) and it's easily portable.
