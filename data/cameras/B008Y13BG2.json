If other brands of items are to be included then that should be indicted in the listing.Camera is excellent- I love it.  There was no manual in English inclosed and the cd rom would not work. There were manuals in French and German- so ok you can download a manual from Fuji direct of course but I have since been told and of course I stand to be corrected that if a camera has been issued to a country such as France or Germany should an issue arise then Fuji in the US would not service this item and it would need to be sent to the country from where it originated. This information I was told in my local photography store and only have their word to go on- but maybe someone wishing to purchase a camera should inquire which country the camera was issued for.In hindsight would I have purchased this kit with the knowledge I have today? probably not and returning the kit was not an option as I needed the camera for my photography degree and I do not have the funds to purchase another and wait for a refund.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008Y13BG2"}}
