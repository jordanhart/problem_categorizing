Even at full zoom the lens extends out only 0.55\" (14 mm). I'd recommend visiting the Panasonic product website as they have good details on the features of the camera. Such as, quick startup (less than a second to power on), quick focusing, long battery life (despite a small 3.7V 1000 mAh battery), and high sensitivity modes, mostly all improved with new Venus III engine. The battery charges up in only ~2 hours with a very small charger that has a fold down AC plug.Very nice LCD display: 2.5\" with 207K pixels. Wide horizontal viewing angle. Has a High Angle mode which works well to see the display above your head. Easy to access boost mode which helps outdoors and it does \"gain\" up for low-light. No reflective coating, however this does not cause a problem since the display is viewed straight on. May want to invest in a clear protective sheet to limit scratches.A few gripes: Given the fact it records good video, why do they have it record sound in low quality? The built-in microphone does pick up sounds okay, however you do notice a difference compared to cameras such as the Canon S2 and Olympus C-770, which record in 16 bit, 44.1 Khz, stereo. With a 2 GB card you can record only ~20 minutes of high quality video. It would have been nice if Panasonic had built-in a better video codec, like MPEG4 to keep the file size down. If you're inclined, save the video to your computer and run it through an encoder such as Windows Media Encoder or QuickTime 7. You can shrink down the 20 minute video to ~150 MB without much loss in video quality. Granted this does require a CPU with some horsepower.The tradeoff with the lens design is that it does not have a wide range of aperture settings (F2.8 - F4.2), thereby causing some limitation in light gathering ability and depth of field ability. Other long zooms can open up to F3.7 at full tele. It only adjusts to it's minimum setting of F7.1 in very bright scenes. Although when you compare to other cameras in this size, the apertures are not bad. In regards to noise, there is minimal occurence at ISO 80/100. It increases as you move up, however it never seems to balloon out of control, even at ISO 800 or 1600. Granted it's noisy, but you can clean it up with a program like NeatImage. Also, you can open up the shutter for night shots to 1, 8, 15, 30, or even 60 seconds.The flash is physically small and adequate in output. Seems to have decent coverage (not quite as good as the Oly C-770 which had a dual range pop-flash). However to compensate for the limited output it will boost the ISO to 200 or 400 which makes for a more grainy picture (a well-lit room may keep it at ~125). There also could be red-eye problems here (if you don't use the red-eye reducing flash mode). With Image Stabilization, you can utilize more natural light shots w/o having to resort to the flash as often.A few tweaks: I'd recommend adjusting the picture quality from \"Fine\" (default) to \"Normal\". This will compress the image down to around 1.1 MB, however there is minimal loss in quality. There are three picture modes to use: Natural, Standard, & Vivid. Each mode progressively increases the sharpness and contrast of the image at the expense of noise. Natural will display a smooth image with more neutral colors; Vivid will make the image sharper and colors will stand out, at the expense of some additional noise. I was using Vivid, however it may saturate colors more than I like. Also, there is an economy mode that will turn off the display after 15 seconds of inactivity and during flash recharge. This seems to work well since the display instantly powers on with a touch of any button.Accessories are hard to find right now, however the only one I'd get is the spare battery. A 512 MB SD card is very inexpensive now and even the supported maximum 2 GB card is a drop in the hat (limited to 2 GB due to FAT16 file system).With a current street price of $300, Panasonic expects to sell a lot of these. In fact, given the features and performance, it will likely take sales away from it's other models. I'd highly recommend this to both beginner and expert users!RECOMMENDED BAG - Search for the \"LowePro Rezo 50\". It's a great fit for this camera.", "Date": "May 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best big little camera, but downfalls are major", "Author": "cogitation", "ReviewID": "R2TCVSSL1VO46D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had a Lumix FZ20 with a 12x zoom, which we loved to death except for three major downfalls -- it was big and clunky, it was slow to focus and wouldn't focus at all sometimes, and it had a major noise problem in lighting that never bothered our previous cameras. When we heard that the TZ1 would give us a 10X zoom at 1/3 the size and without focusing problems, we obsessed for months waiting for it to hit the market. We've now had our TZ1 for a few months and have taken 2 long vacations and about 2,500 photos with it. Here's our expansive list of thoughts...Incredible: Having a 10x zoom that can go in a standard small case from Target and can be tossed in a daybag or purse.Great: Panasonic has improved their focus system and added a focus assist light, and the old focus struggles are gone. The time needed to lock in a shot and capture it is now fast and accurate, and capturing subjects in low light isn't a problem any longer. What a relief.Life Saver: How did we ever live without image stabilization? Panasonic started this movement, and now many other brands are using it. When utilizing the full 10X zoom, this feature is just plain necessary without a tripod.Amazing: The macro/close-up mode allows you to get close enough to a bee that a 4X6 photo is all bee and the veins in its wings are crisp and clear. Our photos show things on raspberries that we couldn't even see with our naked eye. This feature, more than any other, makes people say, \"What kind of camera do you have?!\"Major Downfall: Our greatest joy in this camera is the 10X zoom. But it has also proven to be our greatest disappointment because it is unusable over large distances. We didn't have this problem with our larger FZ20, and we can only assume that it's because the TZ1 lens is about 1/3 the size. If you want to zoom in on your child 25 feet from the water's edge, or a bird 15 feet up in a tree, you're in business. But if you want to zoom in on a mountain top, or crop a scenic vista, you'll be greeted with print quality that rivals the old 110 film format of 1980. Everything gets fuzzy and washed out, as if the photo was taken through a window with the sun bouncing off it.Marjor Downfall 2: For some reason, Panasonic can't seem to get past their problems with noise in less-than-optimal lighting conditions. We've owned Pentax, Olympus, and Minolta cameras and never had this problem with them. Outdoor photos at dusk, night photos with a subject more than 6 or so feet away, and indoor photos in a room larger than about 10X10 all turn into a grainy, spotted mess. The \"starry night\" setting helps in specific circumstances, like shooting a city skyline at night, but there's still some noise to spare. And if there's anything red in the shot, forget it. You can manually lock in a lower ISO to counteract this effect, but then you get a photo that's too dark to use anyway -- not to mention that the whole purpose of a point-and-shoot camera is to eliminate manually setting things.Unnecessary Hassle: While the menu system is easy to navigate, we wish we had to use it much less. The scene mode wheel at the top includes only three of the usual suspects (auto, macro, and movie) and leaves out all other obvious modes that should be at your fingertips (portrait, scenery, sport, night portrait [flash] and night scenery [no flash]). Reaching any of these requires digging through the menu. There are two \"open\" settings on the wheel that you can pre-set to these choices, but two isn't enough and those \"open\" spots would be much better utilized with unusual/personalized settings like baby (records your child's age to the day), underwater, etc.Hassle Saver: In contrast to the bizarre shortage of settings available on the mode wheel, there is an extremely handy dedicated button for adjusting the exposure value. Too much sun? Too much shadow? Without having to go into the menu, you can bump the exposure up or down, one to three increments at a time, to achieve the balance you want.Worry Saver: There's a great review setting that not only plays back your shot for a couple seconds after recording it, but also zooms in on it for a couple seconds to show what your quality will be after printing at 4X6. We used to think things looked fine on the little screen, then realized they were blurry after reaching print size. Now we know right away if we need to retake the photo.Good and Bad: The 2.5-inch screen is big and wonderful, and it does a better job of gaining up and down than our previous digitals have. However, it's still hard to see in bright sunlight and we often gamble on whether we framed a shot as we wanted. The biggest inconvenience is that we often don't find out until later that we took some blurry or overexposed photos.Irritating: The detached lens cap drives us mad. If you have even one other thing in your hands (like the case you just pulled the camera from), removing the lens cap becomes an ordeal. And once it's hanging from the strap, even the slightest breeze will blow it in front of the lens. I understand the lack of an automatic \"door\" for the lens saves on battery useage, but it's so not worth it.Appreciated: The battery charger is ultra-tiny and requires no cord. The prongs flip out from the back to plug into the wall directly. This is a huge plus for us because we hate that we have to pack a whole bag in our suitcase just for chargers -- the cell phone, iPod, shaver, back-up camera (made that mistake once and never will again), etc.Bonus: Of all the batteries we've owned over the years, this one lasts the longest. We've had 200-photo travel days where we haven't even had to use the spare we always carry. Another bonus is that the batteries are affordable, relatively speaking.Confounding: We'll never understand why every camera over $200 isn't weather resistant. For just a few bucks more, they could be manufactured for the real world where simple things like rain and snow happen, and where real people do things like drink something cold on a hot day and get condensation water on their hands. Olympus seems to understand this, but their photo quality isn't as high. Why should we have to choose?Overall: Despite the number of negative comments above, we really do love our TZ1. If the two \"Major Downfalls\" above were remedied, we would even give the TZ1 5 stars. Our current 4 stars is based on \"The Big Picture\" (yes, bad pun intended). Considering the $300-ish price point, and the fact that a point-and-shoot does all the work for you, you can't expect the moon served to you on a platter. Given the size of the TZ1, we can hardly believe our good fortune in having a 10X zoom packed in. Given that it's an automatic point-and-shoot, we can hardly believe our good fortune when we see the gorgeous photos we turn out with little to no effort on our part. And we can hardly believe that we got all of this for just over $300. The pros far outweigh the cons, and when this camera is good, it's VERY GOOD.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Compact, 10x Zoom, Great Outdoor Images", "Author": "Robert Salita \"Software Developer\"", "ReviewID": "R3QVL4DZU6TD76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looking for a compact long zoom camera with optical stabilization that takes great outdoor photos? Currently this is the only choice and a pretty good one at that. I'm very pleased with the image quality of outdoor photos. Colors compare well to the Canon SD600 that I also carry. The TZ1 takes sharp photos. A handy feature is that the zoom works even in movie mode. Indoor image quality seems ordinary. Movie mode is quite adequate so much so that I sold my video camera.The camera has quickly won praise from professional reviewers. It also won a TIPA (Techincal Image Press Association) award for innovative design and image quality.Update 4 May 2006: I don't think I've given enough credit to the TZ1. I'm astounded by the versatility of this camera. Photos are amazingly sharp.Update 21 May 2006: Oy! Camera is totally dead. Some kind of power problem that requires warranty work to fix. The warranty is only 60 days from purchase! Awful.Update 18 July 2006: Bigston (Chicago), the repair depot for Panasonic DMC-TZ1, deserves credit for getting me a loaner camera (albeit a lesser camera), making a quick repair (new electronics and lens), and shipping the repaired camera directly back to me in Paris. The whole process took 7 weeks with several major Bigston snafus.Conclusion: This is an excellent zoom camera. I was unlucky that I got a lemon. There are no other reports of the same failure. Had I been in the US, I would have had an acceptable repair turnaround time. I was lucky to have the failure within the 60 day warranty period. THE WARRANTY IS OUTRAGEOUSLY SHORT. Had I bought the camera here in France, the warranty would have been 2+ years. I RECOMMEND BUYING ELECTRONICS ONLY IF YOU GET/PAY FOR A 1+ year warranty/exchange.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "WOW, Bang for the Buck", "Author": "TomG2", "ReviewID": "R18X8JYKL3BQIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've spent the last year reading and looking at the Canon Powershot S2, Sony H1 and Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7. Looking at the new Canon Powershot S3 and the Sony H5 I found myself drawn to the new Panasonic TZ1K camera because of the new Venius III engine, fast response times and the best Lens in the business. For a Family person that takes pictures of children playing sports and takes over a hundred pictures a month but never develop pictures bigger than an 8 X 10, this is the perfect camera. Sure some people criticize Panasonic's cameras for picture noise above ISO 200 but it doesn't matter if you are doing less than 8 X10 photos. The sharpness of the photos is amazing for a camera that's under $350. After all, if noise is a concern then spend a lot more money and get a DSLR. This camera is not totally perfect and requires a little learning curve of the features but it worth the half hour of time to read the manual. The best feature of this camera is that is a megazoom that is lightweight, can easily fit in your pocket and is $150 cheaper than a Canon Powershot S3 and Sony H5. Sure the Canon and Sony have more manual features and higher megapixels but they can't fit in your pocket. I think 5-megapixels with a Leica lens will be more than satisfying for most people that take spontaneous family pictures. This TZ1K feels well made and the screen is very sharp. Good job Panasonic for making the perfect pocket do-all zoom camera!", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good quality camera with awesome zoom at a reasonable size", "Author": "Neil Munro", "ReviewID": "R3DQ3NN8ZIDR99", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a while researching before purchasing this camera, finally making the choice between the TZ1 and the Canon A700. Both had above average zoom for relatively compact cameras (6x for the A700) and both were around $300. I was initially attracted to the TZ1 by the excellent 10x optical zoom, at the time not found on any other camera of this size (not small enough to go in jeans/shirt pocket but can go in jacket pocket or round neck or in a bag), but there were a few features it lacked that I wasn't too happy with. For one, the battery is a proprietary lithium-ion, instead of the two AA's that the A700 used. I have always preferred to use AA's, as they are easily replaced if they run out when you're not in a position to be able to charge them, and high capacity batteries tend to have good life (although obviously this depends on the camera). I had read that the battery life of the TZ1 was below average, and this was probably the biggest rubbing point in choosing this camera. My other problem is that it lacked a \"Manual\" mode where aperture size and exposure can be manually set. After having a point-and-shoot camera and being unhappy with its performance, especially in low-light conditions, I had hoped to be able to play with manual settings on my next model. Before making my mind up, I tried out each camera at a local store and was immediately impressed with the build quality of the TZ1. I thought the A700 felt cheap and plasticy in comparison.Although tempted by the AA batteries and the manual settings of the A700, I eventually took the plunge and ordered the TZ1. After playing around with it for a bit, I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase and don't regret it at all. There are far more manual settings than I was expecting - exposure can be manually set to 1/8, 1/4, \u00bd or 1 second for low light conditions, or to 15, 30 or 60 seconds in \"Starry Sky\" mode. The ISO can also be manually selected up to 800, with 1600 automatically selected if necessary when the camera is in \"High Sensitivity\" mode. There are no manual aperture size controls, but there are a wide range of modes and also white balance settings (e.g. cloudy, artificial light, sunny, etc.) which really do make a difference if you use the right one. I haven't had a chance to play around with it that much yet but I'm hoping that the starry sky mode combined with one of the white balance settings which gives a smaller aperture size will allow photos of car light trails etc. to be taken. I have used the 60 second exposure to successfully take pictures of constellations, and the movement of the stars is even visible. I have also found that the TZ1 takes really impressive low-light images that really capture what the eye is seeing, rather than making everything bright orange like my previous camera did. The image stabilization also helps considerably here, and exposures of up to about \u00bd second can be used without having to support the camera or use a stand. The issue with the proprietary battery still bugs me a bit and I would have preferred it if it used AA's and had a longer battery life. I can still get a full day's shooting out of it though, and the battery charges within 1-2 hours. I also bought a spare battery which I carry with me just in case.Of course the main selling point of this camera is the zoom which is certainly impressive. 10x zoom is substantially better than the 3x or 4x usually found on cameras of this size, and by setting the image quality to 3MP, an optical zoom of 12.5 can be used - 50x with digital zoom! The image stabilization really helps here as well, and clear pictures can be taken at 10x (or 12.5x) without using a stand. Although I only tried the A700 briefly, I found that even at only 6x, without the image stabilization, photos at the tele end of the zoom were invariably blurred, especially indoors. I may well have not been using the optimum settings, however.In conclusion, I would recommend the TZ1 to anyone who wants a good quality camera capable of taking clear pictures at high zoom and in low-light conditions but does not want to carry around a large D-SLR. For my uses, the 10x zoom and 5MP resolution was is a far more potent combination than 3x or 4x with a 6MP or 7MP resolution like many other model's at this price point. The interface is simple to get the hang of if you have used a digital camera before, yet there are still more advanced features that previous owners of point-and-shoot cameras can have fun exploring and experimenting with.", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Taking a great pictures -- first step", "Author": "Edison \"hightech lover\"", "ReviewID": "R1S854PS855SSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have a old Leica camera that gave me really nice pictures.  After playing with many different film and digital cameras in last few years, I am glad to re-discover the beauty of Leica lens on this great pocket sized camera.We have purcahsed a few different digital cameras from other brands, including Canon, Sony, and Nikon.  For larger size, I really liked Nikon D70s, which takes great pictures, if you don't mind the weight and size.  But my wife really likes a smaller one for taking with her in her hand bag.Many people selecting the camera with how many mega pixel first. From our experience, mega pixel is not the first critiria for selecting a good picture.  For many instances, with other brand of small camera (I don't want to bash other brand, so no name mentioned here), when my wife tried to shot photos for our children, camera would not be ready until they already gone from the scene.  Many times, the other small camera would not be able to get good focus.  Another problem we have with other brand small camera was no enough optical zoom so that the person very small in the picture.  You can see mega pixels will not help in any of those cases.  From our experience, if you have taken a good picture even with 3Mega pixel, that would be able to produce a nice 8x11 inch print out.This little Panasonic DMC-TZ1K solved many of our problems. It produces fabulous pictures.  Its pictures have vivid color. It reminds me my old Leica film camera in its picture quality.  Its amazing 10x optical zoom with optical stablization produce really nice picture. 10x optical zoom is similar to a 200mm zoom lens in DSLR or SLR camera.  This small camera also can take three pictures per seconds, instead of take three seond per picture of our old smaller digital one.  Its size is not smallest for men's shirt pocket all the time, but small enough for fit in wonmen's bag without noticed.This camera has no manual focus, due to its small size. For taking picture in different situation, it has two sets of scene sittings, one set for different objects, another one for different sceneray. If you are shooting for dark situation, please make sure select the night scene setting -- this camera will emit extra light for help focus in the dark night.  The camera has a built-in light meter sort of thing that showing you if the light is enough before taking the picture.If we plan to take a lot of night picture in dark places, we probably will take our Nikon D70s with a big external flash. Without flash shoe and manual focus, like all other small camera, it is hard to take good picture in dark places.With enough room light or outdoor light, getting this camera is the first step for shooting a good picture.

Other long zooms can open up to F3.7 at full tele. It will only adjust to it's minimum setting of F7.1 in very bright scenes.

The flexibility is there though to take a low light, fast moving subject shot at up to ISO 1600 with it's High Sensitivity mode.  The resulting images have a sort of watercolor effect, however the image is definitely usable.  The file size is smaller in this mode, maybe  because it \"blends\" out unusable pixels.  Other cameras simply can not capture photos in these low light, fast moving subject situations.  You can open up the shutter for night shots to 1, 8, 15, 30, or even 60 seconds.  The few night shots I've taken have been quite impressive.  The overall image quality is very good to excellent with photos pushing towards more vibrant and colorful, albeit slightly softer.The flash is physically small and adequate in output.

When the flash is used it will sync at 1/30 second.A few tweaks: I'd recommend adjusting the picture quality from \"Fine\" (default) to \"Normal\". This will compress the image down to around 1.1 MB, however there is minimal loss in quality. There are three picture modes: Natural, Standard, & Vivid.

I would liked to have seen separate controls for Saturation, Sharpness, and Noise - rather than seemingly blending them together in one control.  There is an economy mode that will turn off the display after 15 seconds of inactivity and during flash recharge. This works well since the display instantly powers on with a touch of any button.  It will also go in to a power save mode after 2 minutes (this can be changed or disabled), which basically powers it down.

In the last 4 days, I've take over three hundred photos and numerous video clips. From this short experience, I have to say the camera is simply amazing.I was a Canon fan. I had powershot G2 for four years. I liked it, though at the end the software malfunctioned. We had twins for two months. The G2 wasn't up to the job to record the babies life. The lag from pushing the button to taking the photo is too long. The video clip it makes is too small and too short... I read many review from dpreview and amazon since last month. Mainly considered Canon S3 IS and TZ1. At the end, my wife made the call to pick TZ1 since she wants a compact camera.What I like the camera so far:1. The action is super quick. Turn on the camera, shoot the photos, focus, zoom... You don't feel the lag too much. Perfect for shooting babies.2. The quality of the photo is very good. At the beginning, I was a bit worried for the critics of TZ1's noise. What nonsense! Photos are nice, sharp, well exposed and I don't feel the noise bother me at all even at iso 400 level. Photos printed are equally good. For anyone who doubts its photo quality, if you don't work for national geographic, leave your doubt aside.3. The video works great. I put 1-GB SD card there and use it like a regular camcorder. It takes minutes good video clip. I'm about to buy a 2GB sd card and sell my digital camcorder all together. I don't feel I miss out much.4. Did I mention the 10x zoom and its compact size? What a bless! The camera is well designed, engineered and crafted.5. The menu is intuitive and easy to operate during action. Much better than my G2 experience.6. Price? $308 from circuit. What a steal.Things can be improved.1. The software bundle has nothing I like, just normal stuff. It installed 6/7 different software, most useless.2. You have to use the external battery charger to charge the battery.

This camera not only has a fantastic zoom but it is still smaller than many of the non-compact cameras with limited zoom. The camera is incredibly easy to use. It has a macro setting, which is fantastic for close ups and has adjustable flash settings. The flash itself is a teeny slit just above the lens but it is amazingly bright. You can review your pictures quickly and easily on the generously sized screen and downloading was a snap. The pictures come out amazingly clear and crisp. They're just terrific. It also has color settings right on the menu so if you wanted to make color look warmer or cooler (or in black and white or sepia) you can select it from the menu. The only thing I don't love about it is that it has an external lens cap that you have to actually take off yourself. It comes with a string to attach the cap to the side of the camera so you don't loose it though. I've found that most if not all cameras with an extended zoom tend to have external caps though. I also don't love that you have to take the battery out of the camera in order to charge it. I'm a little afraid that I'll forget to put it back in. I've seen that it's recommended to use high-speed SD cards with the camera but I don't find it very necessary. I used a normal 1GB SanDisk card and it still records the picture faster than many other digital cameras. One thing you have to know though is that the TZ1 does not have a viewfinder. You just use the LCD screen on the back. I actually like this more because then you're seeing exactly what you get and there is no more squinting through that teeny hole. Basically I think that it is the best camera that you can get - certainly in such a tiny package.", "Date": "June 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sets the Bar for Zoom, Exceptional All Around", "Author": "Brett W. \"Nrbelex\"", "ReviewID": "R1V8UNRY9CZ3YN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've tested this camera out for a good while now and have found it hard to believe I ever considered less zooming capability acceptable. Very little jitter occurs even at the furthest settings due to the camera's great stabilization. The sport mode at an ISO of 200 produced usable but somewhat noisy pictures... even with a huge amount of zoom. Capturing the action wasn't much of a problem and the Continuous mode worked quickly and delivered nice action shots. The macro mode usually works great and the camera really stood out here so long as lighting worked out. I haven't had a chance to use it yet in bright sunlight but other reviewers around the net seem to find it stands out there as well. The menus are easy to navigate and any more complex questions are usually answered easily through the manual. One thing to note is that the camera has a detachable lens-cover which gets strung to the camera itself. It's not a major issue but it's a little different than most cameras. The battery lasted exceptionally long for its size and charged in around two hours through a wall-attached charger. When I got the camera, I opted for a 1 gig SD card which has been compatible and allows me to store 410 images at the highest quality or around 11 minutes of (surprisingly good) video. Videos are produced as .MOVs which is slightly annoying but can be worked with and are really great from a point-and shoot camera. While filming, you can even use the zoom features, granted they are slower than usual. All around, the camera seems well made and solid and it's clear Panasonic put a lot of work into it. The modes are intuitive and even technophobes will have a hard time getting confused in \"simple-mode\". --APPENDED-- After months of use and thousands of photos, if I could, I would change my vote to a 5. This camera is excellent!", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best big little camera, but downfalls are major", "Author": "cogitation", "ReviewID": "R3P6ZRNK9WNWF2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We had a Lumix FZ20 with a 12x zoom, which we loved to death except for three major downfalls -- it was big and clunky, it was slow to focus and wouldn't focus at all sometimes, and it had a major noise problem in lighting that never bothered our previous cameras. When we heard that the TZ1 would give us a 10X zoom at 1/3 the size and without focusing problems, we obsessed for months waiting for it to hit the market. We've now had our TZ1 for a few months and have taken 2 long vacations and about 2,500 photos with it. Here's our expansive list of thoughts...Incredible: Having a 10x zoom that can go in a standard small case from Target and can be tossed in a daybag or purse.Great: Panasonic has improved their focus system and added a focus assist light, and the old focus struggles are gone. The time needed to lock in a shot and capture it is now fast and accurate, and capturing subjects in low light isn't a problem any longer. What a relief.Life Saver: How did we ever live without image stabilization? Panasonic started this movement, and now many other brands are using it. When utilizing the full 10X zoom, this feature is just plain necessary without a tripod.Amazing: The macro/close-up mode allows you to get close enough to a bee that a 4X6 photo is all bee and the veins in its wings are crisp and clear. Our photos show things on raspberries that we couldn't even see with our naked eye. This feature, more than any other, makes people say, \"What kind of camera do you have?!\"Major Downfall: Our greatest joy in this camera is the 10X zoom. But it has also proven to be our greatest disappointment because it is unusable over large distances. We didn't have this problem with our larger FZ20, and we can only assume that it's because the TZ1 lens is about 1/3 the size. If you want to zoom in on your child 25 feet from the water's edge, or a bird 15 feet up in a tree, you're in business. But if you want to zoom in on a mountain top, or crop a scenic vista, you'll be greeted with print quality that rivals the old 110 film format of 1980. Everything gets fuzzy and washed out, as if the photo was taken through a window with the sun bouncing off it.Major Downfall 2: For some reason, Panasonic can't seem to get past their problems with noise in less-than-optimal lighting conditions. We've owned Pentax, Olympus, and Minolta cameras and never had this problem with them. Outdoor photos at dusk, night photos with a subject more than 6 or so feet away, and indoor photos in a room larger than about 10X10 all turn into a grainy, spotted mess. The \"starry night\" setting helps in specific circumstances, like shooting a city skyline at night, but there's still some noise to spare. And if there's anything red in the shot, forget it. You can manually lock in a lower ISO to counteract this effect, but then you get a photo that's too dark to use anyway -- not to mention that the whole purpose of a point-and-shoot camera is to eliminate manually setting things.Unnecessary Hassle: While the menu system is easy to navigate, we wish we had to use it much less. The scene mode wheel at the top includes only three of the usual suspects (auto, macro, and movie) and leaves out all other obvious modes that should be at your fingertips (portrait, scenery, sport, night portrait [flash] and night scenery [no flash]). Reaching any of these requires digging through the menu. There are two \"open\" settings on the wheel that you can pre-set to these choices, but two isn't enough and those \"open\" spots would be much better utilized with unusual/personalized settings like baby (records your child's age to the day), underwater, etc.Hassle Saver: In contrast to the bizarre shortage of settings available on the mode wheel, there is an extremely handy dedicated button for adjusting the exposure value. Too much sun? Too much shadow? Without having to go into the menu, you can bump the exposure up or down, one to three increments at a time, to achieve the balance you want.Worry Saver: There's a great review setting that not only plays back your shot for a couple seconds after recording it, but also zooms in on it for a couple seconds to show what your quality will be after printing at 4X6. We used to think things looked fine on the little screen, then realized they were blurry after reaching print size. Now we know right away if we need to retake the photo.Good and Bad: The 2.5-inch screen is big and wonderful, and it does a better job of gaining up and down than our previous digitals have. However, it's still hard to see in bright sunlight and we often gamble on whether we framed a shot as we wanted. The biggest inconvenience is that we often don't find out until later that we took some blurry or overexposed photos.Irritating: The detached lens cap drives us mad. If you have even one other thing in your hands (like the case you just pulled the camera from), removing the lens cap becomes an ordeal. And once it's hanging from the strap, even the slightest breeze will blow it in front of the lens. We understand the lack of an automatic \"door\" for the lens saves on battery useage, but it's so not worth it.Appreciated: The battery charger is ultra-tiny and requires no cord. The prongs flip out from the back to plug into the wall directly. This is a huge plus for us because we hate that we have to pack a whole bag in our suitcase just for chargers -- the cell phone, iPod, shaver, back-up camera (made that mistake once and never will again), etc.Bonus: Of all the batteries we've owned over the years, this one lasts the longest. We've had 200-photo travel days where we haven't even had to use the spare we always carry. Another bonus is that the batteries are affordable, relatively speaking.Confounding: We'll never understand why every camera over $200 isn't weather resistant. For just a few bucks more, they could be manufactured for the real world where simple things like rain and snow happen, and where real people do things like drink something cold on a hot day and get condensation water on their hands. Olympus seems to understand this, but their photo quality isn't as high. Why should we have to choose?Overall: Despite the number of negative comments above, we really do love our TZ1. If the two \"Major Downfalls\" above were remedied, we would even give the TZ1 5 stars. Our current 4 stars is based on \"The Big Picture\" (yes, bad pun intended). Considering the $300-ish price point, and the fact that a point-and-shoot does all the work for you, you can't expect the moon served to you on a platter. Given the size of the TZ1, we can hardly believe our good fortune in having a 10X zoom packed in. Given that it's an automatic point-and-shoot, we can hardly believe our good fortune when we see the gorgeous photos we turn out with little to no effort on our part. And we can hardly believe that we got all of this for just over $300. The pros far outweigh the cons, and when this camera is good, it's VERY GOOD.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's everything they said it was", "Author": "A.

I've usually found Panasonic to be reliable, technologically advanced and of high quality. I had narrowed it down to Panasonic DMC FX01 for the shirt pocket, but then I learned about the TZ1 and my decision was made.It is all it's represented to be. The 10x optical zoom is so effective and the pictures are beautiful. Autofocus is almost instantaneous and I can take many pictures in rapid succession. The quality is superb and 5 megapixels is all I need.  The viewfinder (one of the reasons I was ready to replace my Kodak 4900) is bright, large,clear, and angle-able so you can hold the camera over your head and still look through the viewfinder.I found the operation to be intuitive, but there are so many features that it may take quite a while before I fully explore them all.Battery life seems outstanding.  I zoomed, shot and flashed pretty continuously for 3 days and the battery still had lots left.I put in a 1 Gigabyte ultra II card and I got the Lowepro D-res 20aw case for it.  The case is lined in Tricot which is a good idea to avoid scratching the LCD. The camera fits nicely, but if you're going to carry any but the smallest accessories with it, go for the next size up in cases.Tiny downsides... I would have liked it to be smaller, but then there would have to be compromises; and it's really not big or heavy.  And, a lens cap rather than an automatic cover.I'm truly surprised that the quality, features, technology, and Panasonic name came at such a reasonable price.I would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Search is over - Finally the one I was looking for.", "Author": "Jin J.

Between the Leica design approved lenses, the incredibly effective optical image stabilization and the very decent ergonomics, just about every need is accomodated.  I wanted a pocket camera with extraordinary zoom capability. The TZ1 pretty much satisfies my needs. There are things I don't like about it. No optical viewfinder - but the reality is that with a 10x zoom, you're not going to get an optical viewfinder. (The TZ1 is compact because it uses a truly unique folded lens system. The image is actually diverted by 90 degrees. Very slick design.) The battery is only good for about 200 shots if you use the flash. You definitely want to carry an extra batter or two with this camera. Flash recycle time is also a bit on the lengthy side. The conventional lens cap is something of a pain to work with. Attached by a short cord, it tends to drift into the way of the lens when you are taking pictures. Best to keep it cupped in your hand while you shoot.  That's pretty much the worst of it.  There are abundant good points. The TZ1 is not super-compact, but it does fit nicely in  pants or jacket pocket. Start-up time is quite quick for a point and shoot. The 5 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for most purposes. The 10x zoom is great, though zoom speed is a tad on the slow side. Focus is also a bit soft at maximum zoom. Exposure metering is quite good. The video capabiltiies are extraordinary. With a 2 GB SD card, you can capture slightly more than 20 minutes of 640 x 480 24 fps video with good quality audio. As noted above, the optical image stabilization is as good as it gets.  Ergonomically, this camera is a pleasure to use, even with my relatively large hands. All the controls on the back are well placed and accessible. The exposure button is almost ideally placed: I've had very little difficulty locating it. The zoom swith comes to hand naturally (though, as noted, the zoom speed is on the slow side). You can easily use this camera with one hand.  The LCD screen is usable in every situation except direct bright sunlight. The viewing angle is surprisingly large, so you can shoot from low and high angles. The flash, by the way, appears to work beyond its published range. The exposure metering system does an excellent job with fill flash.  Overall, the TZ1 is a very nice pocket camera. Don't be bothered by the 5 MP sensor - with the Leica design approved optics, the 10x optical zoom and optical image stabilization, the TZ1 is more than suitable for most casual photographic situations.Jerry", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "The most you can get for the price", "Author": "The Crystalline Entity", "ReviewID": "R332TEDOQRCC88", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Lumix DMC-TZ1K for several weeks now, and I couldn't have asked for more in a compact digital camera for this price (which has already gone down since I ordered).

The quality and clarity of the photos is simply outstanding.  The image stabilizer was a huge selling point for me, and has works almost flawlessly, and is irreplaceable when using the 10X zoom.The camera is packed with features, and has many customizable settings.  The interface is very intuitive, and the camera is easily operated with one hand.  You can tell the quality by the nice heft and solid body construction.  It also has nice touches like springs on the battery cover, a locking digital/charging port, and internal battery for date and time storage.Using a tripod with the \"Starry Sky\" scene mode yields some beautiful results in low light settings.  If you don't want to wait the 30-120 seconds required to use the scene mode, you can set the shutter speed to (1second), set the EV level up slightly, and use the 2 second timer with the OIS to eliminate jitter.  The results are still outstanding.Once you get familiar with how the camera operates, there are a lot of settings you can adjust to get the best picture possible.  Don't let the built-in scenes limit you.  Through experimentation you can use the built-in settings of each scene mode for incidents other than what they were originally intended.  Another wonderful feature is the ability to set your own white-balance level.  You simply choose the white-balance custom setting (grouped with tungsten, low-light, daytime..etc), point at an area in the environment you are shooting in (preferably NOT a white area), and the colors adjust accordingly.My favorite aspect of the camera is how user friendly it is.  You don't have to guess how to use it, or how to access settings and review photos.  The brilliant LCD takes the guesswork out of composition, and the many focus modes, coupled with the OIS, almost guarantee a good shot.

Other members of my family had brought their digital camera but they were disappointed that they couldn't get better zoom or clarity.  They took a look at what I was capturing and are now thinking about purchasing one.  We took a night time limo tour of some places but pics were coming out to dark.  I did a little playing around and found a setting on my camera that boosted the flash, the only thing with that is the shutter speed is slower (took up to 8 seconds to capture the pic so no moving in that time).  I just had to switch my camera over to SCN 1, hit the menu button and went down to night scenery.  That greatly increased the light output from the flash.

This is much better than without stabilization at all, but not nearly as good as on the cannon s2/s3 or Sony h5, where if I'm still I can get clear images down to almost 1/3 of a second at 10x zoom.  Unfortunately, you can't just force the camera to limit itself to 1/80 easily, as with a camera with manual settings.  Instead, I found I had to sort of trick it by changing different modes to get a clear (darker) shot, or change iso levels and suffer pretty bad noise artifacts.In fact, all the iso modes show color noise in all but the brightest of environments, even iso80.  However, with a flash at up to about 10 feet, and certainly with daytime outdoor photos, I found iso80 and 100 generally give acceptable images.Finally, I see the macro mode as the saving feature of this camera.  I can get incredibly detailed and clear images of bugs of flowers practically right in front of the camera. (an inch or two).  Detail I can definitely not see with my naked eye becomes clear.Given all this, I'm still planning on returning this camera.  If you're like me and want reliable 10x image stabilized zoom in normal realistic light levels, I just can't recommend this camera.  If the 10x zoom is only going to be used in conjunction with a flash, or outside in close to direct sunlight, and noisy images and lack of manual control aren't that much of a concern I think this camera is a great choice, and a great step forward.Update:  More than the image stabilization, it was the noise in the images that in the end clinched it for me.  There is no setting where the image noise is not apparent or even glaring.  I returned it just before I left for two months in Europe.  I grabbed a Fugifilm s5200.  While it didn't have the image stabilization and is certainly more bulky, it has very clean images and great color.To be fair however, in hindsight, it may have been very useful to have a camera this size (I would have certainly gotten some images that I didn't while i was fishing around in my backpack for my s5200.  Of course, I could have just worn the s5200 around my neck the whole time also), so I am yet undecided if I should have kept it or not.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Panasonic lumix rocks", "Author": "C.

This camera not only has a fantastic zoom but it is still smaller than many of the non-compact cameras with limited zoom. The camera is incredibly easy to use. It has a macro setting, which is fantastic for close ups and has adjustable flash settings. The flash itself is a teeny slit just above the lens but it is amazingly bright. You can review your pictures quickly and easily on the generously sized screen and downloading was a snap. The pictures come out amazingly clear and crisp. They're just terrific. It also has color settings right on the menu so if you wanted to make color look warmer or cooler (or in black and white or sepia) you can select it from the menu. The only thing I don't love about it is that it has an external lens cap that you have to actually take off yourself. It comes with a string to attach the cap to the side of the camera so you don't loose it though. I've found that most if not all cameras with an extended zoom tend to have external caps though. I also don't love that you have to take the battery out of the camera in order to charge it. I'm a little afraid that I'll forget to put it back in. I've seen that it's recommended to use high-speed SD cards with the camera but I don't find it very necessary. I used a normal 1GB SanDisk card and it still records the picture faster than many other digital cameras. One thing you have to know though is that the TZ1 does not have a viewfinder. You just use the LCD screen on the back. I actually like this more because then you're seeing exactly what you get and there is no more squinting through that teeny hole.

The feature set and overall capabilities of the TZ1 are superb - really over the top.  The TZ1 can do things we couldn't even dream of in the age of film and the early age of digital.What I like:  The 10X lens (in a compact body), the Mega Image Stabilization (This is really a \"great thing.\"), the 3 fps burst mode, The selectable autofocus and exposure modes, the easy to use menues for lots and lots of other settings, the (relatively) high sensor sensitivity, fast auto focus, convenience, etc.If used within the very reasonable limits of the camera, the TZ1 produces excellent images.  These limits include \"only\" 5 megapixels resolution.  Even that was almost unheard of only 5 years ago.  However, it is best not to crop the images too much.  You can do the crop in camera though, which is a good thing.  Another thing that could be a limitation for expereinced photographers is the lack of manual controls.  The scene modes are fine.  They produce good exposures, but you have to really think about how to set up the camera for some shots that would be rather routine with a camera with more manual controls, ie shutter and aperature modes or full manual.  However, as I said, the TZ1 can produce some excellent images.  The \"point and shoot\" shooter will be extremely pleased with the results.That said, I gave the TZ1 \"only\" 4 stars.  The camera is \"noisy.\"  I  like to use existing light for most exposures,and turn off the flash.  In high contrast photos and dim light photos - especially at the higher ISO setting, there is very noticable \"noise.\"  Minimize the noise by shooting mostly at the lower ISOs, and mostly keeping your prints to about 4X6 inches.I bought this camera to stick in a pocket when I didn't want to carry the D-SLR kit.  Limitations aside, the convenience of having an image stabilized, 10X lens, in a pocketable camera is a real boon.  Since I bought the TZ1 I have actually taken far more pictures with it than with the D-SLR kit - mostly because it is so \"handy.\"  I've even taken some pretty good wildlife pictures  with it, including a couple of bald eagles - because the camera was \"in my pocket,\" and the D-SLR wasn't.  In summary, pictures are pretty good, the feature set is excellent, and the convenience is superb.I look forward the the \"TZ2,\" which hopefully will address the noise problem, add a bit of resolution, and if not full manual controls, at least add shutter and aperature priority modes. - are you listening, Panasonic.

But the overall quality of the pictures has been somewhat disappointing compared to my past experience, even with a digital camera five years old. The images are not particularly sharp; in fact, they're almost fuzzy and sometimes have noise in them when you zoom in only a little. Also, the flash is horrible. Up close, it overwhelms everything (overexposure) while farther away it gets nothing (underexposure); there doesn't seem to be any real middle ground.Unlike what some have said, though, I think the battery life has been great. I got a second battery, but it has kind of seemed pointless since I rarely have to switch batteries out.

I was drawn in by the great feature set - optical image stabilizer, 10x zoom, small form factor (for such a large zoom). I had read every review I could find of the camera, and was a bit wary of the noise complaints, but I decided that I had to give the camera a try for myself. I need a camera that I can pocket and bring with me to concerts. I need the zoom because I can't guarantee that I'll be close to the stage, and the image stabilizer will really help with slower shutter speeds in low light. So, I bought the camera in time for our Christmas party, where our band was going to be playing. Unfortunately, the camera failed the test miserably. It was too dark to use the camera without a flash, and any picture taken with ISO 200 or above is really unusable for anything except a quick snapshot. I didn't get any pictures of the band that I really want to save. I tried to get good shots in a few different modes - simple, standard, and a few of the scene modes, but nothing looked good. I didn't give up immediately and tried to take some more low-light pictures at home the next night, but there was just more of the same noisy pictures. Any white area in the picture ended up with red, blue, and green speckles through it.I am not new to digital photography - I've owned two Canon point-and-shoots (the great S30 and the S410) and primarily use my Nikon D70 now. I know how to get good photos from a camera, but this one is just too noisy to be useful in low-light. If you're primarily going to be taking pictures outside during the day and can keep the ISO set at 100, then this might work very well for you.

The quality appears just about as good as our normal cable signal.

I was worried about many reports of noise in images and was prepared to try it and send it back if that proved to be a problem. But I'm keeping it.Overall, this camera is great. It is very compact, though not really pocket-sized like the Elph, and it feels sturdy, having a mainly metal body. The zoom is incredible for a camera this small, and the optical image stabilizer works well at reasonable magnification levels. Obviously if you zoom all the way to 10x, any shake from a hand-held shot is going to have a bigger impact. In general use, though, the image stabilizer seems to help quite a lot.On the noise issue: it is true that this camera's images have some more noise (to me, almost like film grain) when taken in lower light levels. If that really bothers you, it could be a deal-breaker. However, I have also noticed that I can GET more shots that my old S400 would not have gotten at all. For example, the first day I shot about 100 photos at a birthday party, which had minimal light, using the camera's \"party\" preset, which slows the shutter speed down and lowers the intensity of the flash. They turned out amazing -- the whole background illumunated, rather than dark as in a typical point-and-shoot flash photo, with the subjects subtly boosted by the flash, instead of blown out by it. The image stabilizer seemed to compensate well for the slower shutter speed, allowing me to hand-hold the camera for everything. There is some pleasing blur around objects in motion, given by the slower shutter. In that context, I can live with a little noise. Many cameras in this compact class would not handle the situation nearly as well.I also have to point out that even fast film (800 or 1600) in traditional 35mm cameras would show some grain, and people often like that. The noise in these is obviously not film grain, but it softens the images in a similar way.The other shooting experience I have is a five-day trip to Hawaii -- no complaints at all; all the photos turned out wonderfully.", "Date": "January 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "T.

The image stbilizer works even at 1/2 sec exposure. However, viewfinder problems and power management need improvement.  The view screen is large, but in sunlight, it is impossible to see the image. There is no optical viewfinder to supplement the LCD screen and I have missed photographs since I could not see what I was aimed at.  Now, Panasonic must have realized this shortcoming, and has a \"Power LCD\" setting which still does not give enough brightness in bright sunlight.  I would suggest placing an optical viewfinder on the next version. I tried to compensate for the brightness of the viewfinder by attaching an \"eFilm\" hood made for the Nikon D200 SLR.  This helped a bit and probably saved many mis-aims. I was disappointed with the battery life, but this could have been because I did not activate the economy mode which switches the LCD monitor off after a fixed amount of time.I would recommend the purchase of this camera with its long telephoto lens, outstanding image quality, and convenient size.

The image stabilizer controlled any shaky movements although I'm still experimenting with that feature. The camera fits comfortably in your hand and the buttons are easy to locate.

Plus, Some Info About its Video Quality!", "Author": "FrontPage", "ReviewID": "R3IIQW2MMSUUDU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have posted some video of what I had shot with the Lumix FZ1, which I had purchased for less than $200. I'd love to have another; the one I did have crapped out on me, resulting from the video footage I had taken in Washington State. Feel free to search in motiono[...] under \"daterace\" (all one word) which will show 10 videos I had shot. First, you'll see the type of shooting I do, which is professional. Second, it gives you at least a small idea of what the TZ1 can do, which is, shoot some decent footage. I actually used it, in conjunction with a high-definition camcorder, to shoot some alternate angles because this camera is soooo compact, you can place it almost anywhere!Back to the reason that I have it no more: watch the footage in motiono of Ocean Shores, Washington. See the sand being whipped into a frenzy by the wind? Well, a grain of sand lodged in between the lens and camera housing, which jammed the lens. While it can be turned on, even the slightest zoom from 28mm would stop the lens, causing the camera to shut itself down, and show a warning that the lens cover was still on. It tells you that the TZ1 is not at all weatherproofed. There aren't sufficient seals to guard against a decent rain or some grit. Be very careful where you use it!I'm a professional photographer, learning how to shoot video. This makes a really decent \"b-roll\" camera, because I can plant a suction cup on glass and mount the tiny camera there, or set it between items, or on top of something, to get a unique perspective that a large camera (like the Panasonic AG-HVX200 1/3\" 3CCD 16:9 HD/DVCPRO/DV Cinema P2 Camera) could never fit into. The footage of Lotte Plaza in motiono will show you where this camera can go. Unfortunately, with any videos posted on the web right now, you simply can't see the quality of the video; the websites compress the video footage too much, which degrades the image quality! But the very fact that I had been using this camera along side of a 3-CCD camera with HD capabilities should tell you that I trust the video that the TZ1 shoots.Meanwhile, I've been missing this camera's capabilities, and I'm arguing over whether to still buy one (in black, please), or whether I should upgrade to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K 7.2MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) instead. While there are some significant issues with digital noise and in-camera \"overprocessing,\" which tries to hide the actual \"digital noise\" (that graininess you see when you try to enlarge some of your pictures) which is a result of a small image chip in the camera, I quickly learned how to compensate and work around the issue to minimize those issues to yield some rather nice results in the still images. It makes me confident enough to leave my Nikon D2Xs 12.4 Megapixel Digital SLR Camera and Nikon D2HS SLR 4.1 Megapixel Digital Camera - BODY ONLY bodies at home when I travel for fun. I at least have a shot of shooting some quick-grab images or videos if something happens. I like keeping this kind of camera close by, in a pocket or something, which makes it more handy to grab if something unfolds right in front of me.I have many pictures posted in xanga, and you're welcome to go to the site and search for \"daterace\"  which will also get you to the pictures I shot. If your settings are tweaked, you'll be able to get some nicely-toned and less-washed out images. The TZ1 does a better job, if you simply move the exposure compensation setting to about -.6, about 2/3rds stop under-exposure. And try not to go above 100 ISo in lower light, while staying at ISO 80 during the daytime!

I am STILL in love with my camera.  I didn't want a bulky SLR since I am a novice, and the 12x zoom version seemed too big for me to realistically carry around.  But, I wanted something with enough zoom to capture nature shots (bears, birds, insects, plants, etc) and that meant I had to accept that it wouldn't fit into my pocket like the cameras of my more \"fashionable\" friends.  Well, they envy my photographs now!  So I can't put it into my pocket, but I have a decent case and I carry it around when I know I will want to take pictures (otherwise I use my annoying camera phone - not the same).I have taken pictures in challenging situations like: on moving vehicles, people running/dancing, night photos, stars, indoor, portraits, etc. and the only challenge I can find is perhaps discovering which setting is most appropriate.  Sometimes, the setting that the camera says is the best, isn't necessarily so.  For example, I took a better \"night\" picture using another setting (I don't recall now what I was, but I had time to try some different settings - so I suggest you use trial and error and get a feel for what works).  I've even taken gorgeous pictures driving on the \"top of the world\" highway under overcast skies!The only two complaints I have, and one I believe has been addressed, are: 1) I hated the lens cap.  But I saw a tourist on my travels who had a new version and it did not have the lens cap, so I am jealous, but I still feel that we belong to an exclusive club of superior camera ownership, and I won't trade my baby for a new model.  The other complaint is with the software, the Lumix Simple Viewer.  It seems very rudimentary and I wish there were a better way to organize my photos.  Sometimes I want to keep certain photos in my camera to show friends, but I don't want to download them again each time, and the Lumix software doesn't allow you to pick which photos you want to download at a given time.But, as my mom used to say, if you ask for ten things and you get nine, why do you complain.

I was looking for a small camera with a large optical zoom to take with me on hiking and backpacking trips. After purchasing the camera, I noticed right away that the picture was out of focus about 50% of the time in simple mode. I reviewed the manual several times thinking I was doing something incorrectly, however to no avail, as the the focus continued to be unreliable no matter what settings I changed. To me this makes the camera virtually worthless. To add to this however, the camera's white balance sensor is very poor and I found that when taking a picture with anything light in color, the light areas are completely washed out in the picture.

This camera has been great.Pros:When I received my first TZ1, the first thing I did was extend the full zoom and shoot some stabilized pics. They were great and I was amazed. Zoom blur was gone even at 10x!!Then I shot a stablized video, and while its was not perfect, it was better than my non-stabilized 12x video camera!! Unlike other \"picture\" camras, you can use the zoom while you are taking a video, and the was a compact camera 1/4 the size!! Out went my video camera.This camera will fit into my pocket when on a work site, and take every picture I need. I use it almost daily.Colors are good and saturation is above what I expected from a compact super-zoom.I was able to buy an underwater case from Panasonic reasonably for this camera as well. It works perfectly, and due to the cameras small initial size, even with the case it is not too big to haul around the Ocean. The underwater pics it took are excellent, and the flash works pretty well too!! A great bonus!!This is a very very versatile picture and video camera.Cons:The battery life is only fair, and the small S007 batteries seem to fail totally in too short of a period of time.Replacements of both Lumix brand and aftermarkets have been no better. There is a limited expectation for such a small camera/mega-zoom/battery combo, but this should be better.Flash effectiveness and dependability has been spotty, especially with the last 2 cameras. While I did not expect an amazing flash, the overall flash results are a bit weak. The first 2 I owned flashed well and about as expected, however lately I have had a couple of flash-sync issues that are bothersome. Could be the used/refurb purchases.Summary:I rated the camera 5 stars because its issues do not outweigh its advantages at all. There is no perfect camera or woman out there, or everyone would own or want only that one.This camera fills my compact camera need wonderfully, and even gets used as our primary video camera.I was a little sad when the newer models went to a wider angle 10x and gave up light efficiency (f2.8 to f3.3) for it. I prefer this f2.8 lens much better, with clearer low light pictures indoor.This would be a perfect entry camera for a novice, or a student, or a grandparent.I am glad to see other Mfg's following Panasonics lead in this arena.

I was very pleased by the compact size along with 10x optical zoom.  I thought the picture quality was fair, as others have mentioned on here.  I compared pictures to an older Olympus I had and found the Olympus was superior.  I figured you have to give up something when you make a more compact camera.Things really went down hill when my charger stopped working 6 months after purchase.  I finally called Panasonic support.  I was floored when they told me that the charger is not covered under warranty.  How shady!I decided to buy a new charger, but found they were $40 a Best Buy.  I took the issue up again with Panasonic and escalated to a supervisor.  In the end, I spent too much time on hold and waiting for call backs from someone in charge.  You have to wait 1-2 days for a supervisor to call back.  If you miss the call, you cannot call them direct and you have to again go through a lengthy process to leave a message.When I finally spoke to someone, they wanted me to produce a receipt or old credit card statement showing when I bought this.  This may be reasonable, but I was so sick of dealing with them over $40, I told them to forget it.  The last thing I wanted to do was spend more time sifting through my files to maybe find the receipt or try to remember which credit card I put it on.Overall, the this camera is fair.  If you end up having to use their support for some reason, your experience will probably go from fair to poor.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cool, Good, Must have", "Author": "Nailesh", "ReviewID": "R216Z0CVXMCQBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What more you expect form a compact camera - manual focus, hot shoe etc?

There is no view finder but the LCD Economy mode might help. The LCD is big and good. First decide what type of photographer u r, how fast u want your camera to click, how frequently, do u have patience to make manual controls or u use Auto mode always, what u will do with your snaps - print BIG posters or share via email and then buy a suitable camera.Standard advice - Keep 2 set of batteries. 1 or 2 GB card.

The best part about this small camera is that it has a 10:1 zoom, which no other small camera has at this time.  As with most small cameras, there is a delay between snapping the shutter and the actual shutter movement.  For faster moving objects, that might mean you aren't going to get a picture of what you thought you were going to get.  There may be a way to avoid that, but I haven't had the time to read the manual.  The camera's 6 megapixel capacity is more than adequate for this type of camera.  Anyone needing more that 6 megapixels should be using a single lense reflex digital camera instead of this type of camera.  The only minor annoyance I have encountered so far is that the zoom is hard to control.  It takes a few \"ins and outs\" to finally compose the photo that you really want.  I guess that I am used to using a zoom lense on a single lense reflex camera, where I can really get what I want more quickly.

It takes clear beautiful pictures and you can put in your own memory cards so you can have it take thousands of photos. The good thing about the camera is that the battery lasts a long time and charges within a couple of hours. The settings and menus are easy to use and understand. The video is HD and very clear as well. I would definitely suggest buying this camera new or used, because it seems to have a long life, but that could just be because I take very good care of my electronics. I always have it in the case when not in use and I still put the lens cap on it whenever I'm not taking photos.The negative is that it is not as light as some portable digital cameras. It is a little on the bulky side too, but it's not a big deal unless you are ALWAYS carrying it in your purse or bag(it does not fit in pants pockets).Overall, I've had great results with this camera for several years and I won't be getting a new one until this one stops working! :)", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Years Later, Still Works Well", "Author": "camera man", "ReviewID": "RVZXRTZB8BAX0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few years back, back when it was still being produced. Through heavy research I decided it looked like the one for me, and haven't ever, not to this day after thousands of pictures, been disappointed much by it. Still viable as a point-and-shoot for day-to-day applications; it takes pictures that look quite good on a computer screen, even as a desktop on a modern monitor, though that is near its resolution limit and noise becomes visible but not prevalent. I don't print my pictures so I cannot tell how they come out.Though 5 megapixels never looked outstanding, it's plenty for almost all applications, and with the lower resolution it can store upwards of 700 pictures on a 2 GB memory card. The screen is good-sized and adequately bright even for direct sunshine, and it looks good too. Menus are simple and fairly intuitive as are most controls. Burst mode seems to work well enough, and the self-timer takes three shots rapid-fire, so at least one will turn out well. The Starry Sky mode is useful for its intended purpose but also works much better for night time landscapes than the Night Landscape mode which tops out at 8-sec. exposure; Starry Sky can be set to a 15-, 30-, or 60-second exposure. Video can only be recorded in VGA or the smaller QVGA sizes, but at 30 fps it looks good given its size. Battery life is pretty good and the battery holds out well over the years.On the down side, it's got flaws. Macro mode can't seem to focus very close at all, though that could be due to my camera's age. Though manual settings exist, they are very limited and do not include a manual focus. Also, the low light performance isn't impressive, and the flash has a short range inside of which everything is washed out and outside of which everything is dark. Though 10x zoom is nice, it is useless for distant scenery, but that's the result of haze and I see no way that could be avoided. The image stabilization may be inferior to most modern cameras but works well for my purposes. If your lens cap isn't tethered, it's easy to lose and expensive to replace.All and all, it's a good camera that has served me well over the years and still shows little sign of wear. Though I have been looking at replacing it, I haven't yet, and likely won't for a while yet, and even when I do it will be because of the newer features and my increasing demand for a very high quality shot, but to be honest, I will have to spend quite a lot to get a device capable of producing a better picture than this one.

Unfortunately, the photo quality using the zoom is very poor (extreme blurriness), making it virtually unusable for that purpose.  No doubt our results would be better using a tripod, but if I wanted to carry around a lot of equipment I'd buy an SLR instead of a compact.  Since the 10X zoom is of no use, I would have been better off buying a better camera with less zoom but that is smaller and that has more megapixels for the same price.  Regular (non-zoom) photos are OK but lighting, focus, and stability can often be a challenge. Even at regular settings, I've never had a camera that produces so many blurry photos.  While the camera sometimes performs well, occasionally it inexplicably refuses to focus and the flash seems erratic.

There is no need to suffer with Panasonic any longer as the other manufacturers have caught up with optical zooms on the digital point and shoot cameras.  There are two primary still camera manufactures: Nikon and Canon.  This applies to professional SLR's and consumer cameras.  If you don't believe me, look at any professional journalist.

This camera is a battery hog.  I got approx. 40 pics, zooming in and out, some previewing and a few flashes.  The battery (a Lithium Ion, no less!) was dying in less than a day!  By comparison, I just went back to my Cannon PowerShot A70 (because I returned the Panasonic) and got 200 pics, many flashes, etc. and the batteries (4 AA NiMH rechargables) are still going strong.Lack of dial presets means you must navigate many menu screens before being able to compose and shoot.  Not convenient at all.On the control dial you get \"Scene 1\" and \"Scene 2\".  I thought, OK I'll use the menus to \"customize\" the two scene settings to 2 situations I frequently encounter: portraits, and landscapes.  The problem here is that the scene selections don't \"stick\" and the latest settings become universal.  The effect is that if you select \"Scene 1\" and go through the menus to set it for, say, portrait and 4:3, then set \"Scene 2\" for landscape with aspect ratio of 16:9, and go back to \"Scene 1\", the aspect ratio isn't 4:3 anymore, it's 16:9.There may be other pro's and con's.

I cannot fully conclude on this camera because I am currently exchanging it for the same model. Why? Well, I ordered it off Circuit City's website for quite an amazing deal and when it arrived I was extremely thrilled. I heard about this camera a few months before it came out and have been awaiting its arrival ever since. I even sold my old camera on eBay before this one even arrived! High hopes? Yes.It arrived and it is gorgeous. But, before I could test it I had to, of course, charge the battery. Once it was charged I put it in and turned it on. Here is the interesting part... the LCD screen was slightly crooked. Not by a drastic amount but enough to make you a little nuts after a while. Only when viewing the menu modes could you notice it. The lens itself and the pictures you take are not crooked, just the menus. It is very odd. I have never seen anything like it. So, today I began the long return and exchange process in hopes it is just a defect in this one camera and not like this with the entire line. Again, this is nothing major but for over $300 it definitely makes an impact.Therefore, I cannot rate this 5 stars just yet but I am hoping to soon. I was able to test out the zoom and it is amazing. The image stabilization and high sensitivity mode are godsend. No more blurry images! In addition, NO red eye in pictures at all. I was and am extremely impressed by the picture quality of this camera and I am convinced it is definitely worth another try. If once the new one arrives and the LCD is straight I will be over joyed. If not, extremely disappointed as this means it is a mass defect in this model. I plan to review again once I receive my replacement with the final answer, so to speak.The only other downfalls with this camera is the fact it does not come with a memory card but I was able to purchase a very good one on amazon for quite cheap so that is no worries. Also, a case is a MUST for this camera. You definitely do not want to drop it. I have also ordered that.
