It was a horrible grey scale with a lot of interference. And we were no where near any other wireless devices at 2 of the 3 locations we tried to use the camera. I sent it back and bought a cheap Sony Camcorder that works great for our purpose. I did email the company and got no help from them. Thankfully it was bought through Amazon.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great cheap solution - using as a baby monitor...", "Author": "Lee \"JWI\"", "ReviewID": "R2A75ZCKTL7A9P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am writing this review from the perspective of someone using this as a baby monitor. Works great, 2.4ghz will reach across a 2500sqft house with ease, but prone to interference by 900mhz or 2.4ghz phone - go with a DECT or 5.8ghz phone and you'll be fine. Audio and video are good for a unit of this price, camera feels really sturdy and has lithium battery backup. Camera transmits fairly wide viewing range, and is still clear even if it is across the room from the crib.My choices were to pony up for an all-in-one LCD video baby monitor, or build my own system with this Clover unit and an LCD monitor. I first tried the all-in-one LCD video monitor but it broke after 6 months (monitors prone to overheated internally, fried the receiver), and decided to use this Clover the second time around. Bought a 19\" LCD TV and this thing is great. Big picture, multiple cameras for the two babies, and if anything breaks I can replace the component rather than throwing the whole system away (as I did with the first all-in-one unit).", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "No 400 foot range here", "Author": "Leslie Ablondi \"Lawles\"", "ReviewID": "R1DOMKN3PNS8DA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to be able to see my reception area from my office. Through one wall, 30 feet at most, and the antenna is very sensitive for the picture. I don't see any way that this would reach 400 feet. For the price, you get what you pay for. Not very sophisticated, which makes it plug and play.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Clover Wireless camera a Good Value and Good Performer", "Author": "Stanley F. Zubel \"sfz\"", "ReviewID": "R1AIML6BHD49OJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This unit functions very well and appears to be well built.  Picture clarity is very good and audio quality is better than average.  The high frequency makes the picture vulnerable to people movement and electronic interference as the maximum range is approached.  Also, the box doesn't say one way other the other whether the camera is suitable for outside application, which it is not.  Also, there is no battery isolation switch, so when the adapter power is removed, the camera switches automatically to lithium battery power.  This is a disadvantage for applications where the camera is fired up by a remote motion sensor, and requires that the camera run all the time. All in all though, this is a good buy at the price.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Security System", "Author": "Private", "ReviewID": "RM4M8C3ET9GKW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Security camera has very poor wireless connectivity.

L. \"JL\"", "ReviewID": "R2NEEDB4G7O9AD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I used it as a baby monitor but the reception was very glitchy. I've had several of these in the past from when I purchased a 3 pack from Sam's Club and this one from Amazon (total of 4 cameras and receivers). They all failed over a period of time as I used them for a 2 year period. The type of failures ranged from the camera to the receiver. But they all consistently gave an image with a single fuzzy line across the screen that would travel from top-to-bottom in a cyclical pattern, as the static line traveled across the screen it would also give an audible static sound. As far as failures go, sometimes the camera would stop responding and sometimes the receiver would stop responding and eventually both would stop working. I've had one of those cameras stop operating in as little as 1 week and had another last longer than 12 months (yes the other 2 died somewhere in between), so it didn't have a good track record. As a baby monitor, it did capture a clean image (when it was visible) and decent audio (when it wasn't interrupted by the static line), especially in comparison to the baby monitors out in the market which were usually more expensive and with a grainier image.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "have not field tested yet", "Author": "frank anderson", "ReviewID": "R2Z8PQCLSH0Q2T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "tow walls and about 30' away works ok at home when i get out in a open area works good up 50'", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It was just what I wanted", "Author": "W Williams", "ReviewID": "R2PWGML59NRZFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this on the front porch and front yard.

I get color during the day with a clear picture, and black and white at night in the dark.  The night vision works well and so does the sound.  The picture flickers once in a while but it never was a bother, it really reminded me to take a look at it once in a while.  It was super easy to hook up and install, it even came with the mounting bracket for the camera.  The battery backup lasted me almost 6 hours before i realized it had come unplugged.
