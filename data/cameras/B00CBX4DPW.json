The zoom is excellent in bringing things in the distance closer with clear, concise photos but if you are close to a very small item like a \"peeper\" (frog) which is tiny and needs enhancement, well the photo's were muddy.  If I remember to push the button to release the flash, then the flash does an adequate job if the room is dark / low light.  I use a background light that is strong to get the best effect since the flash alone in low light can sometimes leave a shadow.  Low light photographs without the flash do not come up with clear pictures if using automatic settings - at least with my understanding of this camera and may improve with more use.  Manual settings are effective and generate pictures similar but not quite like a DSL.  But then this is not a DSL and shouldn't be expected to perform as such.  I tend to gravitate in recent years to cameras with automatic settings.  I noticed that while using the automatic settings that the camera will automatically pull out peoples faces but if they are at different distances from each other, some faces will be clear while others will not.  I haven't tried the 3-D feature or panorama.  The automatic settings (there are two) will sometimes take multiple pictures to combine into one picture on it's own.  It does take a little longer sometimes to process the picture before readying itself for the next.  There's probably a reason that it will process slowly on some pictures and not other's in the same lighting with no movement but it seems arbitrary.  I put it at 15 mega pixels since I list items through auctiva which does not easily accept the 20 mp.  The nice feature this camera has is the option allowing one to take 20 mp, 10 mp and 5 mp, vga, 15 m and 2m.  HDTVs and printing up to A3+ (13\" to 19\")is 15 mp and 3 mp.  Although I have read that the 20 mp is not a true 20, it certainly provides clearer pictures than my Canon IS which is a 14.5 mp.  The movie function appears to work well on facebook if HD is pressed before playing the video (on facebook) but really does it's best with a tripod which is not always an option.  If you buy the camera without a kit, the camera will only have a computer connected charger and not one you can plug into the wall which was a disappointment.  The card-reader does not look like the picture (short and black) and the battery is not an OEM Sony battery.  The editing software that comes with the camera is inadequate.  I'm not a professional photographer but editing is very important.  I use Picasa 3 which is adequate and best of all; free.  The tripod works but not the quality I use.  The 32 gb memory is adequate but not the best memory card for movies/video.  The bag is compact with compartments for accessories and helps to protect the camera while traveling. The other items in this kit are helpful and helps to stop the nickel and dime costs for each of accessories one would purchase.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Item", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R20MJO3WAHI0PY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a deal!
