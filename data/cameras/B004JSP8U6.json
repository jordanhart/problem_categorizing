I got some great pictures on the trip.  A few had a small spot slightly smudged from a water spot on the lens, but that's not the camera's fault.  There was splashing throughout the ride down the rapids.  Most of the pictures were very good.  Some were great.  Previously I had used disposable cameras for water sports, but these pictures were infinitely better than those obtained with disposables.I also had my daughter take pictures with this on the rest of our vacation, while I used my Nikon D90.  She got plenty of good pictures, both in good light and at dusk as well.  As a point-and-shoot, pocketable, waterproof camera, this works great, and I wouldn't hesitate to use it when I don't want to carry a large dslr.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gives up early", "Author": "Mary C McConnell", "ReviewID": "R3RB92FV0AJ7NQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter and my husband.

I assumed that the ruggedized case would be a better fit for the dust, occasional stream crossing, vibrations, and general havoc of deployments.  I was right on those counts.  10 months later, the outside camera still looks fairly new.  However, there are some issues with it.Poor performance: this camera does well outside, focusing and taking a picture in usually around half a second.  Inside, however, is a totally different story.  With a flash or without, the camera had a hard time getting clear pictures.  It would spend an excessive time trying to focus (usually on what was not the subject) and then take a muddied picture at such a slow shutter speed that the picture was generally unusable.  If using a flash, there would be a lag of 2-3 seconds between pressing the shutter release and the camera firing.  Sometimes it would just refuse to take a picture.  There are many times I would have to have somebody else take a picture because the Fuji XP refused to.Weak points in case: I had the camera in my pocket one day and took it out to find that several of the buttons had been smashed in and were no longer usable.  So while the case can stand falls, water, etc., the buttons can't take the pressure from my thighs pushing it against the inside of my pocket.This camera is essentially trash after 10 months.  I'm not fooling with repairs or warranty service on a camera that performs so poorly anyway.  It's loaded full of virtually useless features but can't get the basics down: take good pictures (fast) and don't break.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Working for now...", "Author": "YourNameHere", "ReviewID": "R15P7MJOEAU41X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*EDIT: Raised to five stars - I have taken this camera on numerous trips now, fully submerged it repeatedly (never more than a foot) I have beaten the crap out of this camera and it keeps comming back for more. When closing the battery compartment make sure (as the manual says) that there is absolutely no yellow showing on the latch and you should be golden. At this point I cannot confirm the durability issues reported which nearly lead to me not purchasing this camera and have to attribute the complaints to opperator error.Figured I'd take a chance on this camera, I do a good bit of kayaking and was hoping I might get a decent waterproof with abit of optical zoom. First of all the image quality is good, I like the layout of the camera, and definitely like the one touch video. Good out of the way I have taken this out once, I don't do underwater photography but it's definitely going to get hit with water along the way. Then, according to the manual I rinsed/soaked it in clean water when I got home. Then hung it on a peg and went to get dinner quick, two hours later when reviewing the days shots water leaked out of the camera any time a button was pressed - and low and behold the area around the battery also had a few drops. The way the seals or designed that isn't a problem the antechamber can get wet without the battery/smart card getting wet but for the price of the camera I am not pleased with that. Audio playback from the camera is horrible but once the video is uploaded it's fine. It also boggles my mind you have to hold the power button a few seconds to turn it on but one bump will shut it off instantly.My final thoughts on this camera are that it's not bad but I don't have a ton of faith in it. I have used the Kodak C123 sport and find it takes far better pictures when moving and it has dual locking doors providing a higher level of confidence in it's waterproof(ness) and it's cheaper.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fuji disappoints", "Author": "Norberto Rivera", "ReviewID": "R1WGMO2EFOY8TE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "A co-worker and I both bought this same camera and have used it for about a week now both indoors and out.  Photography is part of our job and we know enough to have an educated expectation of what a point-and-shoot camera can and cannot do.  This camera fails miserably in most situations we put it through.  The auto-focus is sluggish in both regular and macro modes.  The white balance doesn't seem to work correctly, yielding yellowish photographs inside a white room with white lighting in all white balance modes.  Simple indoor photographs with a flash of people from 4 feet away are blurry and very noisy.  The camera does not handle objects in motion well at all, even using the sports setting.  Judging from previous experience with a number of brands of digital cameras the XP20 seems to have serious firmware problems which I would totally not expect from Fuji.  The actual camera handled extremely dusty conditions very well but the software just doesn't capture and process the images very well at all.  Needless to say I will be returning this camera and going back to Olympus or Cannon for my point-and-shoot needs.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "Spudinski", "ReviewID": "R116Y3ZIG6J13O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife and she loves it.

Wang \"jwangamazon\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZEFKWTNMAIWA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got the Fuji XP20 mainly for taking videos in conditions that my Canon HD camcorder can not. On my first usage in a river rafting event, I already see the problems with this camera:1) I am experienced with Camera and camcorders, I know how to hold them properly. But the lens head is placed in a very awkward place, your fingers will easily cover part of the lens head. So, don't be surprised to see your fingers in the final photos and video clips. It's almost for sure that you will not get photos or videos of yourself. Because other people may not be able to hold this camera properly to take yours.2) Hard to fine tune the zoom speed. Not convenient, but I can live with that.3) The camera won't focus while zooming (it will focus after zooming stops). This is a typical issue with non-DSLR camera in video mode. I saw the same thing in Panasonic camera also. Not a big issue to me.4) This is the biggest flaw, the audio is not in sync with the video. I have to turn off the audio from the video clips, and add background music when producing the final movie for the rafting trip. Even my simple Flip video camera handle this better than this Fuji camera.5) The video quality is no way to compare with regular HD camcorder. The image is kind of grainy, even at 1pm strong sunshine with good light. Again, I can accept this since I am in a condition (around water) where normal camcorder can not be used.6) Indoor photo quality is no way to compare with my 5-year-old 5MP Panasonic camera.But this is OK to me since I am in a condition (around water) where my normal camera can not be used.If this is the only camera you want to have, I won't recommend this. However, if your intend is \"ONLY\" to take photos, videos in conditions where your normal gears can not, then I think this Fuju XP20 is acceptable....if you don't mind the out-of-sync audio problem.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Piece of JUNK, Amazon should stop selling FUJI Products", "Author": "Olivia and Luiz Marques", "ReviewID": "R3CPX210FDKRA9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was the worse headache ever.

When I asked what they had changed on the numerous models since this one, I received the same answer- the door. Duh! It leaks! Based on the numerous door changes and similar reviews to mine, I suspect they know that and they should stand behind their product when they've made something that might have problems. I am never buying a FUJI camera again! If you make the choice to do so after reading all the negative reviews, be sure you buy a lengthy extended warranty.
