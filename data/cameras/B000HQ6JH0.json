It's not damaged from over use because it's not on a main door but it seems the keypad just isn't weather proof enough. The CPU seems fine, but it's indoors above the ceiling tiles.  I'll have to make a box to protect it from the weather I guess?.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT!!", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R1WKQ3AMLWSLJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this stable, reliable and durable unit since 2004 and have only good things to review as well as my customers. If more were available I would definitely want to wish list them all.
