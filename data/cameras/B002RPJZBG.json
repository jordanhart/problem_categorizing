VideoSecu Mini Security CCTV DVR Recorder Motion Detection Overwrite Schedule Videos with Audio Recording 3UA The camera that came with this combination is part number IR31A.  The camera is a weatherproof audio/color/IR  420 TVL 1/3 Sony CCD camera with a 3.6 mm lens.  It is well built with an adjustable sun screen except for the mount and the way it attached to the body of the camera.  The steel part that attached to the camera body with 2 small screws was loose upon arrival.  These screws may be threaded into the aluminum body.  They were tightened with extreme caution as not to strip the threads in the camera body. They could also have steel inserts in the body, I did not check.  The mount relied on pressure on two round balls trapped between two metal strips.  When tightened and in place the camera could still be moved.  It may work OK only time will tell. The camera images are what you would expect for a 420 TVL camera.  The color images were detailed and clear while the IR images were OK and what would be expected at a distance of 25 feet from the camera.  The audio was not used. The combination with the DVR work great.  Performance get a 5 star, construction of the camera/mount gets a 4 star.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.95", "Features": "Mini DVR Recorder.
