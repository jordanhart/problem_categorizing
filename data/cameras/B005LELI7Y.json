The BNC connection twisted on fine, but they weren't tight. You had to wiggle them to get the cameras to show up on the screens. I had to order different ones (without the wire) that fit tighter, to complete the install.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent solution for security DVRs", "Author": "James D. Blackburn", "ReviewID": "RXM7K4ZTJO3U5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used this in combination with DC baluns to wire security cameras back to DVR over cat 5 cable.  The longest run was ~160' and I had no issues with the signal quality.  The center pins are blunt on the end, with no radius or taper whatsoever, this can lead to the imperssion of a tight fit or not fitting at all.  the easiest way I found to insert them is to align the outer sleeve with the retainer posts, then push the connector inward via holding the boot and spinning back and forth slightly.  Once the connector is seated you can then spin the outter sleeve into the locked position.  Great price on these compared to other sources!", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly works", "Author": "L.
