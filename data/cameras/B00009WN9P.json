{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A nearly perfect mid-range digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1C6X710H7MIG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've taken indoor and outdoor shots with this camera and blown them up to 12x18 ($2.99 at the local Costco) with astounding results. The few artifacts there are (mostly in the shadows) aren't viewable unless you are within a few inches of the 12x18 print. Of course I only printed the very best shots at this large size, but I haven't seen any artifacts in any of the shots I've taken (~1000) that would be visible on an 8x10 print from a distance of more than 3 inches. Also, the artifacts themselves are quite interesting. They aren't the square blocks or jaggies you expect in JPEGs, but rather the kind of blobs that you get when you look at a grainy part of a 35mm print under magnification. Anyway they seem to blend in and enhance the picture instead of weaken it. For instance my cat has extremely fine fur that is gray with a very very small white tip in places, giving the cat a grizzled appearance. These tips show up in the pics making the image look razor sharp. A similar thing happens with the \"peach fuzz\" on my kids faces. These details don't show up in any of my 35mm point-and-shoot photos. Battery life is very good. I've never ran the 2100mAh nimh batteries I bought (Walmart-- $16 for 4 batteries with a home and auto charger) completely dead but I've taken over 100 shots (many of them flash) between charges several times. The thing I like most is about this camera is that I haven't had to edit any of the shots (except for cosmetic purposes) before printing: the sharpness, brightness/contrast and color of the shots seem to be optimal. The size of the picture files is small, most of my pics come out at 700k - 1.3mb. The flash is strong. While experimenting, I took a picture of my (large) living room in the near dark with the flash. The picture came out perfectly sharp and exposed in such a way that it looks like the lights are on. Flash strength is adjusted appropriately most of the time and red-eye is not a problem (when I remember to turn on the red-eye setting). I don't miss most of the adjustments available on \"higher end\" cameras. For instance the auto white balance seems to work nearly perfectly in all situations as do the auto aperture size and shutter speed. There are settings on the dial for low light, high shutter speed, and close-up focus. However these settings are only selectable and not adjustable. This brings up the one thing I would add to the camera if I could and that is a setting that would allow me to get the raw data in either uncompressed or TIFF format. This hasn't been an issue really since the camera seems to do a better job of sharpening and color adjustment than I can with Photoshop (I'm not an expert). However, when I did edit some pizza sauce out of one the pics with Photoshop I found myself in a quandary. The original picture was about 900k in size (about 10:1 JPEG compression). How should I save the file? I was afraid that I would lose some picture quality if I saved it at such a high compression. In the end, I saved the picture to a 1mb JPEG took it to Costco and had them print a 11x14 print which turned out flawless. Let me finish by saying that this camera is extremely easy to use. My six year-old picked up this camera and started taking shots (albeit using the view finder rather than the lcd display).", "Date": "December 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "Awesome Point-N-Shoot Digital Camera", "Author": "\"foxwell12\"", "ReviewID": "R9V454WX4SOJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this as gift.

The price is good for a 3 megapixels camera and it was really simple to use (I learned to use it without the manual). Picture quality is good (similar to other 3 Mpixel camera), colors are saturated, maybe too much in the reds. The images are a bit overprocessed, not terrible but can be seen in the details of a 8x10 pictures.I did not acquired the docking station and will not do it, it was very simple to transfer the pictures with the included USB cable. A must is a 1850 to 2200 mAh rechargeable battery set with a fast charger (as with other digicams).This camera was designed as a point-and-shot, so it have  few manual controls (the most useful control is that exposure can be varied by +/- 2 EV). The white balance is automatic only (no manual options), but the camera can handle different light sources with very good results.The autofocus system is very good, specially considering that the camera has no focus-assist lamp. You can lock the focus and the exposure, partially pressing the \"shutter\" release.You can not select shutter speed or lens aperture (as with other point-and-shot cameras), but you can use the scene modes to vary it (I use speed mode more than the standard auto mode, and turn off the flash except when I really need it).The LCD is ok (average), considering the price, my only complain is that it was difficult to see in very dim light and is better to use the optical viewfinder in these cases.The startup time is slow if you compare it with a film camera, but equivalent to other digicams in this range. The same issue applies to the \"shutter\" delay after button pressure. The camera was well constructed and I consider it beautiful designed. The size was small if not diminutive, almost the same as my Rollei 35 (the smallest 35mm camera in the 60's), I am using the Easyshare with a hand made Rollei 35 bag.

The Kodak 6330 is a great overall digital camera for the price! It is really easy to use, and the EasyShare software is very simple. It creates great pics, and I've already used the print ordering function on the software to print photos to my local grocer. Great quality photos up to 11x14.The size of the camera is average, but if I had another $100 to spend, I would probably go with the Elph or Minolta's slim body camera (XT?). I don't know if they are as simple to use, but they are less than half the thickness and the Minolta doesn't have an external zoom, which cuts down on noise and there is nothing to bump around. The only problem with the smaller cameras is the proprietary batteries (you can't just throw some AA's in them, as you can with the 6330).All of that said, I'm VERY HAPPY with my 6330. I got a 128 MB card. I would recommend watching the papers for deals on this one. I found one with a free 64 MB card on sale for 199 at one retailer, and got another retailer to do a price match and throw in a 128 MB card instead of the 64 for only $10 extra. Not too shabby. :-) so, for under $300, I got the camera, rechargable batteries and charger, a case, & a 128mB card.:-)", "Date": "January 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Kodak makes an interest in photography a passion", "Author": "MC", "ReviewID": "RHBHRA6ARM5FS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received Kodak's cx6330 camera for Christmas 2003 and could not be more pleased with it. I have always been interested in photography as are many members of my family. Having this camera has turned my interest into a passion. The photos are sharp, clear, with wonderful color. The camera is easy to use but not so basic that you lose out on creativity. There are many innovative  features such as the burst or action mode and the color modes: sepia, black and white, and color. This has allowed me to move past basic photography and get creative. The selftimer (10 seconds) is available for both photographs and videos. Video is available with audio, which is perfect for capturing moments that surpass a single shot. Cx6330 is a 3.1 MP camera, which is plenty for a novice photographer. Eventually, I would like a camera with 4-5 MP. The LCD is a nice size and makes it easy to include all necessary parts of a photograph. With 3X optical zoom and 3.3 advanced digital zoom, you can get even closer to your subject. That being said the more zoom, the poorer the resolution. However, for someone not taking professional photographs this is OK. I received a battery charger rather than the dock for this camera. I am glad because I later purchased the compatible printer dock 6000 (great buy) and another dock would be a waste. I reccomend the dock as a battery charger and an easy way to share photographs. However, I do not advise purchasing it if you will buy the printer dock 6000. I removed one star due to the flimsy door covering the memory card storage and USB port. Hasn't been too much of a problem but when one isn't gentle, it could be. Also, the Kodak EasyShare software could be imporved. Yes, it is easy to crop, reduce red eye, store, share, and explore other fun effects. However, it is very tempermental and slow on my computer. If I need to transfer more than 5 pictures, I pray it won't freeze. All and all this is a wonderful camera. I will be able to look back fondly on this camera as it inspired me to be an amateur photographer. I hope this review helps anyone find a wonderful digital camera.

The picture quality is incredible, as well as lighting even on the darkest nights.  The flash is very strong.  I get tons of compliments on my pictures, and i'm by no means a professional photographer.  Kodak's EasyShare software is nice for a beginner, but for professional picture editing I'd suggest either Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro.  I have a SanDisk 256Meg card as well, and it works great, i can either take about 306 highest quality pictures or about 16min of video.  In fact, the card is about 3x as fast editing, taking and thumbing through video and pictures vs. using internal memory.  I'd recommend a small camera bag for this camera [doesn't come with any bag] and a 4-pack of rechargeable AA batteries.  I got SONY batteries and they work very nice, although the camera does eat power very quickly, so make sure to have a pair of batteries always handy.

(See reviews of those below, just in case you run across them.)CX6330 is extremely easy to use. The photo quality is wonderful (yes, you are able to choose the photo quality from 1.1MP to 3.1), and there are many innovative features not present in any other cameras I have used or owned. It is also very small, compared with older cameras or to the HP or Fujifilm models. Another great feature is that you can buy rechargeable batteries to use with either a 3-volt AC Adapter (not included, unfortunately) or the optional camera dock or camera printer dock. Or, if you already have a recharger, the camera only takes two AA batteries.Another great feature is the video mode. Not only does it capture video with sound, the quality is also very good. I suggest getting a larger memory card (at least 256MB, but 1GB for the longest shots) if you want to use it frequently for video.I docked one star for reasons stated by other customers. One is the extremely flimsy USB/SD card door. I don't think it'll break unless you put some pressure on it, but I recommend you be careful when you open it to insert/remove the memory card or insert the USB (which is mini - it uses a smaller head than the standard USB cable) cable. Another problem is the Kodak software included. It tries to be \"too helpful\" which just gets in the way. Kodak should release a simpler program for those of us who just want to load pictures and video to our computers!If you can look over those two problems, I recommend this camera strongly. It isn't for the professional - it is for the family, the high school or college student. I think you will enjoy using it as much as I.Kodak CX6330 is my third digital camera to date. My first is a Fujifilm MX-1200, which I received when I graduated high school, nearly five years ago now. It is a good camera, and it still continues to take great pictures at 1.3MP, but I needed a camera with a video capturing option. It is a shame Fujifilm doesn't make thin camera's any more...most of their cameras are so thick now. If you are looking for a used digital camera for your younger children or for very casual pictures, I recommend looking for this one.My second digital camera is an Omisys 4.0MP 4-in-1 camera, which I bought for a measly $80. I was curious about this camera, because it came with so many options. It is a so-so camera - it takes still pictures, video with sound, records sound only, and also works as a webcam. The LCD quality is absolutely dreadful, the flash takes more than 15 seconds to load, and the white balance is practically non-existant. The flash is also too strong for any shot closer than six feet. I keep it to use as a webcam that I can take anywhere with ease. It takes great outdoor pictures and videos, however. But I don't recommend ANYONE purchasing this camera, unless you ONLY take outdoor pictures/videos that doesn't require flash.", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Decent digital camera", "Author": "Rocco", "ReviewID": "R3AQK7X9OQ1OB9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While a little too expensive to be a \"throw away\" camera, this is a basic digital camera that provides good pictures for home use. Pictures are of good quality and can be enlarged up to 5x7 and barely 8X10. This also means you can crop your pictures and magnify your pictures up to a point. Photos are sharp and generally more than adequate for home use, although the results are typical for an autofocus: decent overall, but occasionally it focuses on the wrong subject and flash photos can tend to look washed out. I have not found the other settings: landscape, closeup, action to be of much use yet. The video feature is handy, it is a bit choppy but decent enough to be shown in a small window on a computer monitor. The software is helpful for the novice user who doesn't want to manually organize his or her photos via Windows. The software makes it easy to upload pictures from the camera, but the default setting is for it to be constantly running in the background whenever you turn the computer on - this will slow your system down. ALso, managing your pictures can be a pain especially if you have a lot of previously taken photos already stored on the harddrive. If you use Windows XP, you probably don't need their software. The card uses Secure digital flash media which I think is good: it is stable, has a good price point, and is widely used by many items (such as my notebook computer and Pocket PC ). There is a plastic cover which flaps over the lens when the camera is off, but you really need a case for this if you want to protect it adequately. It uses 2 AA batteries, and seems to consume them pretty rapidly. Overall, if you are looking for an uncomplicated, inexpensive but well performing digital camera, I think this is a good value, and I'm pleased with this purchase. However, if you can afford a little better, and are technically apt enough, I strongly recommend getting a camera with more megapixels and more control over your images.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "I think this camera is great!", "Author": "D.

Indoor shots without the flash are even better than with the flash, while indoor flash pictures are not over-exposed.I also love the way the settings show up on the monitor with a brief description of the setting and what it's used for. It makes the camera very easy to use, with no chance of turning the dial to the wrong setting by mistake.Its one weak point is that the battery door is very fragile, and the catch tends to break, so that the door won't stay closed with batteries in it. This issue is so ubiquitous that it's almost a non-issue: replacement battery doors are inexpensive and very easy to find.When my battery door broke, I put my camera up for sale to someone who could replace it - after buying another CX6330 that I hope will be as good.

The optional \"easyshare dock\" is not at all necessary, as I upload my pictures with a simple USB cable.I've been, for the most part, happy with the pictures I've taken (over 1000). It usually focuses well, but on the pictures I took at the zoo, I could not make it focus on the animals instead of the fences I was looking through.Low-light pictures frequently turn out badly. Also, the LCD review misrepresents the brightness of pictures. Pictures that look perfect on the review are often too dark on my computer. Sometimes I have to force the flash on, because it doesn't recognize that there isn't enough light.I didn't have this problem when I first bought the camera, but now, it will not focus in extremely bright light (such as on the beach, with bright sunlight and reflections from the ocean and sand).The quality of the pictures is perfect for 4x6 prints, but I've never tried anything bigger. Overall, I usually do edit the pictures I take, but I don't think the originals are that bad. Just too dark, often.If you are planning on using this camera for video, CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE. Even on the highest quality setting, the videos are a tiny resolution. Also, the camera has a microphone for recording sound, but if you want to review your video, it has no speaker.

I absolutely HATE the software that comes with this camera. It is not user friendly at all, I lose my pictures, they don't show up in their folders when I go to retrieve them and every photo I download has to go in this software. It prints nice pictures after you finally get them ready. All mine have red eye, so the dock was a waste of $200 as it only gave me about 3 photos and is basically an expensive recharger which takes up space. I also want to use it for auction photos but cannot get good close ups or find my photos later and dislike waiting while each picture downloads again everytime I take a new picture. I have to sit and wait about 5 minutes or more to even get to my new pic for my auction as  have yet to edit every pic. Most end up with red eye and need retouching. They also do not always turn out as I take them. Sometimes the flash is delayed and I don't get the shot i want. i have set the red eye and flash but it does not work properly.

I've found that the camera begins to stick and sometimes makes it challenging when you want to start shooting pictures right away.  It appears that the internal functioning of the lens does not always spring out forward when you turn it on.  This can slow down your shooting time frame as you have to use the manual wide angle features to open it up.  This was the only area of challenge I had and you might have.

I recently switched to digital camera after using the 35mm camera for a LONG time.  My first digital camera I ordered online from Walmart was the HP-733 for the same price.  The HP-733 was a crappy made camera. The pictures was always too dark when taken indoor, even with all the lights turned ON. Another bad thing about the HP-733 was it thru batteries almost every 10 picture takes...I couldn't believe it! It drains the battery so fast.  I hated and returned the camera to Walmart. Then I thought ALL digital cameras are the same until I researched and purchased the KODAK CX-6330...and WOW!! What a difference!! The CX-6330 has changed my perception about digital camera. Like this camera for these reasons: [1] picture qualities was beautiful and bright even warm light. [2] battery seems to last at least 3 times longer than the HP-733. [3] The Kodak Easy-share software...they NOT kidding when they called it EASY SHARE. It's really fun to use their software.  I was able to email directly from the camera or from the computer after loading the pictures. I can run the slide-shows continuously.  The pictues editing/enhancement features allow easy editing your pictures before save. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera.  I have shot over 120 pictures so far and maybe replaced the batteries about the 4th times - which is not bad.
