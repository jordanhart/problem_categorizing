This camera holds up to our expectations.  The picture quality is amazing.  The scene modes perform well, but we don't use them that often, we prefer to point and shoot with the auto-mode.  This camera is replacing a 3MP nikon coolpix, that finally wore out.  Just remember when you buy this camera, it is a pocket sized digital camera for around $100.  Don't expect to be taking photos for National Geographic!!  It is a great little camera  :)", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Could use one extra mode in scenes", "Author": "C. B. Fagan", "ReviewID": "R3440YSH1WH6Y9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nice camera-especially for under $90. One thing I failed to check before purchasing is the various scene modes. Unfortunately, living in Florida requires a mode for Beach scenes, and this doesn't appear to have one-but it does have many others. The display is quite good and compares well to the Canon A590IS. The on-screen menu is good-fairly intuitive. The instruction manual is available on disc (provided) or can be downloaded and saved from the Olympus site (pdf). You do not need the proprietary imaging software provided-Windows Photo Gallery or Picasa does just as well. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery appears to hold its charge very well-it is not rechargeable in the camera, but comes with a swivel wall plug charger and is easy to use. Battery removal/insertion is easy. Haven't used the micro SD adapter yet, so can't comment on that. The camera is described as \"dark gray\", but is actually clad in a highly reflective- almost mirror like-finish. It does show fingerprints as a result, but they are easily avoided by being careful or removing with a semi-damp cloth. It was a good purchase for the money. Olympus seems to make a very good product, both in terms of build and image quality.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dissapointed", "Author": "Gerald", "ReviewID": "R15XN60UDMU8CS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited to get this camera because the reviews seemed pretty good. I was disappointed in the picture quality and would have sent it back but needed it for vacation right away. The video is not very good and most pictures seem fuzzy and have lighting issues. It does have quite a few settings and I may be able to get some better pictures but I wanted a decent point and shoot. This wasn't it. It does have some pros. I like the lithium battery, the screen is nice and clear, the menu is fairly easy to navigate, the video uses Windows Media Player not Quicktime like a lot of cameras, and it's nice and slim so it fits in a pocket well.

After reading all the negative reviews, I feel that this camera has gotten a bum rap!  It has most of the features of much more expensive models and is a trememdous bargain.  As for it's performance all you have to do is learn how to make the proper settings and have the patience to wait for the Auto-focus target box to turn green before shooting.  If setting the best shooting mode and scenes is to much for you, just use the \"iAUTO\" mode and everything is automatically selected for you.  But you can't just take this camera out of the box point & shoot.  The biggest problem I had was trying to figure out the hopelessly inadequate operating manual supplied on disk by the manufacturer.  It is worse than the IRS tax code.  I just studied one button at a time until I figured out all the functions for myself.

I got the camera very fast, and was so excited, and could tell from the very first shot, it wasn't what I wanted. The shot was blurry, doesnt adjust well to light, and has a hard time focusing. So very disappointed because I loved my other model that took pictures so much better. Now I have the pain of having to pack it all up and return it and order the other model from Best Buy.

Since my other one started having issues after the warranty, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a new camera and to fix the old one, it would've cost me $100.  This Olympus Camera is very hard to use. I miss the wheel on the cybershot that gives you the features right away.  With the Olympus, you have to use the menu feature and search for the settings you want.  It is not a point and click camera.  If you point and click indoors, your pictures will not come out well if there's not enough light. Don't listen to the hype about the 'i-auto' feature.  It does nothing good for you.  It doesn't instantly focus or fix the lighting settings.  My pictures were mostly grainy and blurry.  I'd recommend you buy something else.  Not worth the price.

It also isn't really pink at all. Its a really dark mucky color. I ended up with my sister in law's old camera. Which is a waaay better camera. I gave the Olympus to my daughter as a toy.

Uses an XD memory card (or micro-SD), which is why I bought it, but may not fit your needs. Other reviewers said it takes \"out of focus\" photos. This is incorrect. If you just mash on the shutter, yes, the photo will probably be out of focus.

As for point and shoot, hopeless. For real, cant get a decent shot unless i spend a minute adjusting the settings. As for asking strangers to take pictures of your group, embarrassing. the picture is so grainy adn poorly lit that they have to take several pictures to get a decent one. Im really tired of my special moments not being appropriately captured by this camera and will probably be getting a new one soon.It does have some pros. About every third picture i get an amazing one. And everytime i transfer the photos to my computer, they look much better than they did on the tiny camera screen.

ANY excess light makes the photo terrible.  The reduction settings are weak, and as expected, the manual shutter speed settings are useless.  Also, the 'Shaky Hand Adjustment' feature does virtually nothing.  I love my P&S; cameras, but this one is terrible for it.  Every single photo takes three to four seconds to actually capture.

There must have been no quality control on this model or else they just didn't care. I would rate the final picture quality beside that of a 1960s Kodak Instamatic.

Maybe I had a lemon, but the macro capability was ...well, incapable. Color was okay, but side-by-side comparison with my older FE-230 showed inaccurate and spotty rendering. The overall feel of the camera was cheap and shaky -- I should have trusted my fingers on initial examination! Lesson learned.  But Olympus's race to the bottom came home most depressingly when the camera broke -- one morning, after the lens came out to play, it wouldn't retract -- and I sent it back for warranty repairs, and my warranty was deemed invalid due to impact damage. Fair enough, had there been an impact, but there wasn't. Previous Olympus cameras sustained serious shocks -- this is a pocket camera, after all! -- and kept on clicking.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.

I have the \"small frame\" pocket cameras at work (several models) and none of them take good point and shoot pictures with out messing with settings and holding them real still. So when I looked for a camera like this for personal use I wanted one that was not so hard to work with for a good picture, all the reviews (here and other sites) said this was a great small camera..... well mostly...  it still needs a lot of work on your part to take good pictures unless you are outside on a sunny day.  I am very disappointed in how it takes indoor photos and if anyone has found the pocket camera that actually works please point me in the right direction as this is not the one.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor Picture Quality", "Author": "David Marquardt", "ReviewID": "R33TQI07FQQ6UU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very poor picture quality with this camera, you might think you're saving money buying this one instead of a nicer model for 30-50 dollars more but you sacrifice a ton of quality -- don't buy this one.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Steer Clear!!", "Author": "latka-wodka \"korkumi\"", "ReviewID": "RVML3GC576CUU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hands down awful camera.

However, the first thing I noticed about this camera was the awful picture quality. The camera itself is equipped with a appreciable number of settings but none of them seem to affect the quality of the picture! What use is a 12MP camera if the vibrancy of the colors of the scene being taken is crappy quality? The video setting does not have sound and the flash is concentrated in one area rather than lighting up the entire scene. Photos taken in a dark setting are awful even when on the indoor setting. The one good thing about this camera is the thin width and light weight: two qualities that make the camera manageable and able to be carried around with ease.Overall, I was so disappointed with the camera that I actually returned it. I will definitely not be gambling with an olympus camera again.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too much plastic", "Author": "J.
