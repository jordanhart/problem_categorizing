Does what it needs to do!", "Author": "Vero A.", "ReviewID": "R37E7TYSP23D3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, I don't know why others are giving this camera a low review.  Perhaps they haven't played with it enough.  I have only had this camera for about two weeks.  I gave it to myself for a birthday present cause it was time to get rid of my old Nikon 3.2 mp camera and I am about to spend a semester in France and throughout Europe doing some field work for my Master's thesis.First of all, the sheer size of this camera is amazing (its smaller than my ipod video).  I was originally going to get the s10 but was unable to find it (I guess they're not selling it anymore), but quite honestly 2 mp difference is no big deal.  12mp is more than enough.  I have gotten so many compliments on this camera so far just because of its size and the fact that it has 12mp rather than 10 or even 8.I think the picture quality is outstanding!  I have been playing with it practically everyday taking pictures of anything and everything to get a good test out of it.  So far, all these pictures look very very nice.  One thing I like to do with cameras is play around with its settings.  This camera, although it has a Best Shot Feature (pre-programmed settings for certain situations), I'm the type of person who likes to experiment with those settings anyway.  This camera allows you to do that with the best shot feature and it has a manual feature so that you can adjust everything!  I hate cameras that won't let you mess with its pre-programmed settings cause let's face it they don't always get it right!  Then the best part is, you can save these settings that you've created and the camera will remember them for you.One thing I see in these reviews is that the picture quality is bad.  The s12 (as I'm sure with other casios) has a \"quick shutter\" setting.  This setting will immediately take the picture before it has a chance to focus (why you would do that I'm not sure).  You can turn this off!  That was one of the first things I changed when I started playing with it.The HD videos this camera takes are very impressive!  I have posted a couple of them on Youtube (look under my name: vsa23).  They look fantastic on our 52\" HDTV!  Have not run into any problems like the sound not being in sync with the video.My ONLY complaint about this camera is that when the camera is on \"Best Shot Auto Focus\" (the lowest, easiest, setting for grandma), the focus makes very loud almost scratching noises because it is constantly focusing.  I took the camera back, exchanged it for a new one, and even tried the store's two displays and they all seem to do that.  Perhaps this is something that will change with the later s12s that come out.  But in all honesty, I don't use that setting anyway (not that I'm a pro or anything), so it doesn't bother me too much.All in all, I am very happy with this little camera!  It does everything I need it to do (which is really to primarily take pictures) and it offers so much more than I need at the same time (make up setting, dynamic photo, smile shutter, face detection, youtube capture, and more!).  If you're looking for a very nice camera with lots of features in a small compact travel-friendly camera then this one is a very good choice.  I will be posting some of my sample photos on Amazon's customer images thing.  Hope you all find this review useful!", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hard to recommend this camera...", "Author": "Brian K. Martin \"diggio\"", "ReviewID": "RQ128OTUKV2PJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I usually shoot with a DSLR and wanted to get a new small camera to carry around and replace my 5 year old Pentax Optio S4i. My main criteria for picking the camera were weight, HD video capture, image quality, and ease of use. I've since updated this list to include image stabilization.The casio s12 is one of the smallest cameras you can get. Reviews also said the camera was snappy. Looking at reviewer's test shots showed it had very good image quality, so I picked one up.I wanted to like this camera. I tried to like this camera. But in the end the camera is just too unreliable to be used as a point and shoot. The images typically look very good on the camera's screen, but on a large monitor they were often under saturated, auto white balance was off, and most importantly they were frequently out of focus.  With this camera, you need to pre-focus with a 1/2 shutter press before taking a picture. Far too often, the camera would never focus - even in sunlight.  The only time there was reliable focus was when the subject was relatively close to the camera (a couple yards or less away) and cooperative. When the focus worked correctly, the picture quality was still not perfect (harsh chromatic aberration) but was admittedly much better than average. I cannot figure out why the focus is so hit or miss. Perhaps it is operator error or lack of image stabilization. It may even be that the camera defaults to focus a few feet away when its autofocus algorithm fails. This would be fine for taking a picture of your friends sitting at a table with you, but it does not work if you are zoomed-in on your kids playing in the yard.The HD video quality was fairly good for nearby subjects. It did suffer from lack of any image stabilization technology and it is doubtful anyone would be using this camera for shooting video with a tripod. With a camera this small I really think you need some form of image stabilization.I will return the Casio and try one of the new Canon's or the Lumix FX-35/37/48 (or even the new Pentax w80).  I would only recommend the Casio for someone who primarily shoots nearby, cooperative subjects. Those images seem to come out OK most of the time and even excellent once in a while.  This camera would not be my recommendation if you want to capture your kids candidly. If you like the Casio style or feature set, perhaps the Casio Z400 will be better since it has image stabilization, a longer zoom, and perhaps some updated firmware.Positives:* Easy to use* Great feature set* Small (but not too small) size* Great set of 'best shot' modes, including a unique whiteboard and business card mode which can replace your scanner* Unlimited length HD video capture in AVI format (good for Windows) at 24fps. The lack of 30fps in HD mode wasn't noticeable.* Good build quality with excellent LCD screen* Good low-light focus lamp* Potential to take some very good picturesNegatives:* Very unreliable focus and sometimes unreliable white balance* Terrible printed user manual (but the online manual is very good)* No standard cable connections on camera for USB* No digital video out from the camera* Some of the in-camera features just did not work reliably. Most notable is the feature where you can subtract the background from around your subject and place the subject in another image.* Lens not very wide (~36mm)", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but you'll need to get a bigger capacity SD card", "Author": "Kenneth Young", "ReviewID": "R3RQ63K8YLOZBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Casio EX-S12 was chosen over other compact cameras in the US market, due to its tiny size and price. My intention is to find a super compact but decent camera for my wife to travel with, where a full size DSLR is not desirable.The camera started up quickly but does take about 2-3 seconds between shots (not bad considering that I had the automatic flash on and it'll take time to charge up the capacitor).  The buttons and the menu are intuitive and easy to figure out. The camera is packed with features that I'll never use, such as BestShot, Youtube, Dynamic Photo, smile recognition, etc.  On the other hand, I do find the historgram and the tripod mount highly benficial.Battery life seems to be good. Although it didn't make sense to have a compact camera, but the battery charger is as big as the camera itself, with a long power cable to the outlet. It's a generic detachable cable so I'll replace it with a shorter one (or shorten the one provided).  I've not tried if I can charge the battery by using the USB cable only.As for the resulting photos, it does a great job with portraits as I'm impressed with the smooth and natural skin tone that it produces. I had no problem with noise with the normal ISO setting. It produces beautiful, peaceful pastile color for landscape photos as well.  I did not play with any camera setting to adjust the internal processing, but you'll probably need to do so if you want photos with more contrast and more punch.  It's not an issue with me, since I can always post-process the files later via Photoshop.  As with most point-n-shoot, too bad it doesn't create RAW file format.I tend to use the wide side rather than telephoto with my photography style.  Thus, I hardly use the zoom feature.  This camera has the 36mm equivalent, which is about the normal human's view point so images aren't distorted much.  Not an ultra-wide, but not bad.The on camera flash is okay for a tiny camera, and the output is adjustable.  I do rather see a PC port added with the future model, so I can shoot with an off-camera flash.As for the HD video, it works fine.  Originally, I tested it with an old SD card and was suspicious if audio and video were in sync. Later, I put in a better SDHC card and had no issue with the video. The video in HD mode started up quickly, but it's limited to 10 minute clips (due to size limitation of FAT32 file format as with other point-and-shoot?).  You'll have to remember to find a break to stop-and-restart quickly before the 10 minute is up.Be sure to get the biggest and fast SDHC card that you can get.  My old 1GB SD card was filled quickly with about 7 minutes of HD video and few 12MP photos.  Also, due to its tiny dimension, be sure to use the hand strap.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "NON-TECHIE'S VERDICT: It's sleek, fits easily in your shirt pocket and shoots REALLY great photos!", "Author": "AmazonLoyalist \"BenS\"", "ReviewID": "R22L3Z9NSCCSZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, here is the non-techie's verdict on this camera... I really like it and rate it a SOLID FOUR STARS !!!I will leave the techie's to discuss all the pros and cons of the specs. In a nutshell, here are my thoughts:1) It's definitely mini and fits easily in a shirt pocket.  So bring one along in your pocket and you'll always  be ready for a Kodak...oops! \"Casio Moment\"2) I was all set to buy the silver one, but when they  took it out of the box, it looked way tooo shiny!  Like the color of bright, polished tin... so I  asked to see the other colors and bought the gold,  champagne, beer-colored one. It looks fantastic.3) WITHOUT the manual, I played around with the MENU  and the various buttons and got everything working  to my liking within 30 minutes. And I am no  techie!4) OUTPUT: Yes, the photos and videos ROCKED for this  mini-camera. Expensive, separate-lens, high-end  cameras will take BETTER photos, but these are  DEFINITELY VERY GOOD! Colors are vibrant!5) BEST SHOT - Pre-programmed settings for outdoors,  night, and about 20-other almost-any-event. This  is a fun gadget and let's you focus on the  subject/s while this little cam does all the  work.6) PRICE: Definitely OK for all that you get in that  size!7) C'MON !!!.. I said enough... go out and buy one!  YOU will be HAPPY you did. Trust me. It rocks!", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best camera in this category.", "Author": "Solarx.110mb", "ReviewID": "RJL3FEDT8P18B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion this is the best camera in this category.  Before I buy any camera I review sample photos full size, which for this camera at 12mp is wall size, about 60 inches wide.  I look for noise, detail and color.  I have had this camera for a week and ran it through my tests and it did not disappoint.  Noise in the blue sky is almost non-existent, something you would expect from an SLR.  Detail in pretty good also.  In daylight I just leave it in auto and it shoots awesome pictures.  Indoors you could leave it in auto, but all your shots will be at 400 ISO which is starting to add noise at this level.  I set it at 200 ISO indoors for near perfect noise free pictures.I have tried some of the Best Shot settings and the landscape scenic setting is terrible, don't even bother using it because it messes up the saturation.  The composite setting is cool that it pictures the subject in motion but there is not much use for it.  I am yet to try all of the Best Shot settings, there is a lot of them.Make-up function works perfectly, maybe too good. It has 12 levels of make-up.  Makes my 79 year old mother look like she is 19.  I would rather take pictures of the way things really are, but this is definitely a cool feature.Low light performance seems really good, it is able to focus and take good shots.HD video is really nice, though 24 fps is a bit choppy.  You will need to learn how to take video at 24 fps.  Basically you need to keep still and do not change direction too fast.  The 640x480 is smoother at 30 fps and it looks pretty good also if there is enough light.  One surprise for me is that it is able to zoom during video.  It is not optical zoom during video it is digital zoom but it performs like optical zoom.  There is no deterioration when in full zoom, and the manual states this also.  This is great to be able to zoom in video.  You can consider this optical video zoom since it performs the same as.  The colors of the video are not as good as broadcast HDTV, but it seems almost as sharp in good lighting.There is no photo editing software included with this camera, which is a shock to me since all my last cameras were Fujifilms and they include a great post processing software.  I searched for a replacement software and found Photoscape, it is free and even better than Finepix software.  At full resolution this Casio comes out with 5-6.8 mb picture file size.  Well with the photoscape I can save in 70% jpg compression that brings down the file size to 1.1 mb, saves a lot of memory.  I compared the difference and I cannot see any difference between the 1.1 mb picture and the 6.5 mb picture, and I am viewing them full size.I normally keep this camera at 3:2 and Normal, again I don't see Fine as being any improvement over Normal.  3:2 is wider than normal to look better on tv's but still can be printed on a 4x6.  The 16:9 seems too wide and then when you go to print them, stores like Walgreens may have a problem cropping part of the picture out of it.I have always had Fujifilms, but Casio just seems to come out with things first and I just couldn't wait for Fujifilm to come out with a comparable camera.  I am glad I made the move to Casio and I think I will stick with Casio for all my future cameras.There is no camera this small with all these features and that takes such awesome pictures.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Quality Pictures & Video, BUT...", "Author": "R. M. Mayhew", "ReviewID": "R21WD5678VAVWP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a prior version of this camera that had a docking station to charge the battery and transfer pictures to storage.  It was simple.  You put the camera in the dock and that was it.This version does not have the docking station.  It requires you to remove the battery to charge it.  If you remove the battery for a period of time you will lose your settings.  If you have a charged backup battery and you switch it quickly, I've found the settings (date, time, quality, etc) are retained.The picture quality (still and video) is improved from the EX-S500 I had before.  The screen is much, much easier to read in sunlight.  On the EX-S500 I sometimes had to hold my hand over the screen to block the light so I could see it.What would make this camera an absolute standout is if the charger was a docking station AND could be used to charge the battery separately.

The Casio EX-S12 offers exceptional value in a small package.Pros, to mention a few- Costs about $200 from Amazon.- Creates totally new pictures or video through object isolation or scene separation (powerful).- Allows customizable control panel of the monitor screen.- Supports personalized options through best shot.- Uses the very friendly best shot selection.- Allows personalizing Power On Default Settings.- Creates decent pictures up to 1600 ISO where I prefer 400 ISO or lower.- Allows HD video in 24 frames per second (pan or move the camera slowly).- Allows SD video in 30 frames per second.- Uses standard or legacy parts, such as, SD or SDHC memory cards, backward compatible batteries etc.- Fits easily in a pocket.- Blazes a new trail because this camera is hard to beat.Cons- Charger requires cord and charging unit rather than flip out plug (not a major problem).", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "I wish it was better", "Author": "Andy Sernovitz \"Author, Word of Mouth Marketi...", "ReviewID": "R22PHFJTKWMYGL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned 4 previous versions of this camera.

It easily fits into a shirt or cargo pants pocket and is so lightweight, you will hardy notice it is there. The LCD screen is crisp and almost the sie of the camera itself. I have found it to be very easy to operate and it has proven to be good for general scenery shots, as well as close-ups of flowers and other objects. The zoom is good and it has an auto anti-shake mode. It has a very nice \"best shot\" feature, that allows one to optimize the photo based on the type of shot. It has a good flash and you can select whether or not to use the flash (useful in a museum). It doesn't compete with my digital SLR for its zoom capabilites, but I bought it to use on business trips and as a back-up camera. On a recent hiking trip, I found myself using it more than my SLR for standard shots, because it was so easy to use and the image quality was very good.

Have a flaw on Auto-flash - shot when you blink", "Author": "B.

It snaps right when your eyes half-way blink due to the flash - everytime. I did self-portrait to find this out, and it should apply to shooting others as well. It is a design flaw I believe. You have to remember to choose Red-eye reduction, which does not make me blink in the picture, before shooting persons.Also I cannot believe how poor the quality of the image when I shoot the 1st picture out of the box. If I did not try harder, I would have returned it the same day. I don't understand why Casio wants to set the default to its worst.I am still wondering if I should return this for Canon SD780, which performs (responds) better and felt more solid in my hand.

If the camera is perfectly still on a tripod or table, video is okay, but holding the camera made the video very grainy.For the price, I can't complain.

After messing with the options a little bit I realized that if you switch the mode to best shot mode it tends to stop doing the busy please wait message , it only seems to happen with other options. When I first took it out of the box the first thing I noticed was the buzzing noise it makes when the zoom is trying to focus... its an odd noise almost as if a little bug is trapped inside it and trying to get out. I had recently tried the Canon PowerShot SD780IS but had to return it because of the ridiculously blurry pictures. This Casio on the other hand takes amazing photos even in low lights... with the canon i remember trying very hard to keep still just to get a sharp picture, it was nearly impossible.

Alas, it was dropped and could not be repaired.  I was offered the opportunity to replace it with a refurbished Casio Exilim EX-S12 for $100.00.  I decided to take a chance on it.I received the new camera and it was defective.  It would continually give me an error \"Busy, Please Wait\" after shooting a photo, instead of flashing the photo on the screen for review.  If I reset the camera to the stock settings, the error would stop, but as soon as any changes were made to the settings, the error would re-occur.I took it to Time Machine, the local repair center for Casio.  Actually I took it there twice, it was never repaired.  I contacted Casio direct and was told I had to send it to New Jersey.  I was also told to include a description of the problem, which I did, at length.  Anyone who took a minute to read the correspondence would understand that resetting the camera would alleviate the error, and making changes to the settings would make the error occur.Guess what.  They reset the camera and sent it back to me!  Hellooooooooooooo!  Did anyone read the required description of the problem?  I guess not.  Calls to Casio to speak to a supervisor went unreturned.For the $100.00 I have spent way too much time trying to get what I paid for.  Maybe that is Casio's strategy, wear the purchaser down.I do not know if customer service is better at other manufacturers, but I will not be spending any more money with Casio.  It really is a shame.  It is a great camera minus the error.  It is super slim and perfect on many levels.  It takes excellent photos, as did the previous model I owned.

With some tweaking of the settings (lowest ISO and stepped down exposures) and saving them into memory I was able to make the camera produce OK pictures.The LCD screen shows vertical pixel cross-talk which gives a false impression that the image quality is quite bad, but after a picture is taken the cross-talk is gone. Perhaps there is an algorithm eliminating the artifact by post-processing - this might explain why it takes 2-3 sec for the camera to save a picture.The body of the camera is aluminum and is quite sturdy - good for a pocket camera. However, the battery compartment lid is made of thin, cheap plastic, and is very easy to open accidentally. After only 2 months of use (during which I took the battery out at most 5 times) the plastic lid fell off and broke into pieces. This has essentially rendered the camera non-usable since the battery started falling off or losing contact 50% of time. To keep the camera working I had to machine a new lid out of aluminum; I then had to drill and tap holes in plastic inside of the camera to hold the new aluminum lid in place. Here the overall sturdiness of the body has helped since the camera had to be clamped in a vice. :)Pros: Cost, size, picture quality given cost+size, good video quality.Cons: poor design of battery compartment lid; unreliable autofocus; unreliable auto exposure settings.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Owned 2--both broken after couple months", "Author": "Medusa \"booklover\"", "ReviewID": "R364T2GVQ91HN2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned two generations of this camera and both lasted only a short while. The 1st began to malfunction after about 2 months. Instead of allowing me to turn it on and take photos, it would go directly to date time settings, and I would have to reset the date time every time I turned it on. Date/time settings can be bypassed, but if they are, the camera would not know what order the photos were taken and they would download all jumbled up, which is actually a bigger pain than you'd imagine when going to order prints or locate a specific photo. I also had problems with the battery/charger from the very start. Sometimes it would charge, sometimes not.I misplaced my first and a friend learned that my original camera was lost bought me a newer version as a gift. About a week from the time I began using it, it also began to malfunction. It won't turn on much of the time, and I've already replaced the battery and charger.

There are a few nit picky bits about this camera that i thought i should just mention. Thought it has a large rich screen, part of it is used for a 'sidebar' and though it's convenient to have compared to little icons scattered around, the sidebar somewhat shrinks the image. Upon reviewing the picture, however, it looks fine. I do now know if the picture is being stretched out to fit the screen or if it's shrunk to incorporate the sidebar. Image quality is superb so the shrinking/stretching doesn't matter. This camera is filled with extra features, but the manual doesn't really explain them. This shouldn't really matter to normal users as the camera is ready to shoot as soon as you put the battery in, but i'm a techie so i HAVE to go through all the menus and play with all the adjustments the camera had to offer.
