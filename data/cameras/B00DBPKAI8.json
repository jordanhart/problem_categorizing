LOVE!", "Author": "DBGoode", "ReviewID": "R1CCJAU9NLG3FB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been researching and shopping for a DSLR camera for months. I had narrowed my choices down to Canon or Nikon, or so I thought. Then, I discovered PENTAX on a few blogs and found overwhelmingly positive customer reviews on different sites, which seems to be hard to come by when it comes to DSLRs. Most people seem to really love or really hate certain brands, leaving the ratings and reviews somewhat lopsided. When browsing Amazon recently, this lightening deal sealed the deal and I could not be more pleased. The price for the kit with a second lens was affordable considering the competition and I have to say that the picture quality is excellent! This camera has a lot of features, but you can get started quickly snapping shots using AUTO or SCAN. I have yet to take any video with it, but I will soon. I look forward to taking more pictures with this camera to fully explore everything it has to offer.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "A diamond in the rough.  Pentax delivers yet again.", "Author": "Wesley Williams", "ReviewID": "R1O6N9T8FNAQVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Pentax K-500 is a great mid-level camera, particularly if you are invested in the Pentax universe.  I have multiple Pentax lenses from my conventional SLR that I've had for 10+ years.  I looked into purchasing a Pentax because I wanted to leverage my older Pentax lenses as I delved further into the digital SLR world.The 16MP sensor may not be as high as some of the other cameras on the market, but I've found that 16MP is more than enough for most photgraphers unless you plan on printing images above 22''.  Otherwise, you will be nmore than satisfied.The manual, automatic, and semi-automatic (Av-Priority, etc.) are highly responsive.  Changing the manual settings is seamless once you spend a few miniutes with the camera.  I was pleased with how responsive and accurate the sensor is.All in all, I think that this is a good buy for any mid-level photography who doesn't want to go the Nikon/Canon route for any number of reasons.  Admittedly, I have a somewhat irrational attachment to Pentax because it is the brand that I first learned how to shoot film on, but I objectively think that this is a great camera.  I would recommend it.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Impressed", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1KEJ34S67O9EN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this camera in the mail a couple days ago and have already put it to the test in multiple ways\u2014including low light situations, as I attended a wedding the day after receiving it!!

I decided to go with the pentax k500 camera and two lenses because of the price. It is very easy to start using even without reading the instruction manual. This camera takes good quality pictures with good color.It comes with the two lenses, battery and battery holder, usb cable, strap, and instruction manual.

Unfortunately, I do not have another comparison, but for my needs (design portfolio), this camera rocks!! It shoots RAW (DNG) and high quality JPG photos and takes video. It shoots very well in low light, even without tinkering around with the settings.My camera came with four double A batteries, battery holder, neck strap and kit lens, but did not come with the AC power supply (not sure I\u2019ll need this anyway). The lithium batteries (an optional purchase), are only sold to consumers in other parts of the world \u2013 there\u2019s a notation in the product manual.The printed manual is very thick and provides functional step-by-step instructions. I did, however, have to view a YouTube video to figure out how to put the neck strap on! Oh, and make sure you put the lens on correctly, otherwise nothing will be visible in the viewfinder and the large screen will be quite dim \u2013 it will still take photos though!", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Francis J.", "ReviewID": "R1DQ0UD16SPDUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I purchased this camera, my interest in photography has been renewed.

I am in a media major at school. I know what aperture is. I know what shutter speed is. I know what ISO is. But this is my first dslr. I looked through all the comparison sites and decided that I wanted a Pentax k-30. At this point you're thinking that I'm posting a review for the wrong item. No. I wanted a k-30. But after some research, I found that is has an older (uglier?) brother. The k-50. It was the perfect camera but I did some more research. By giving up an electronic level and the weather resistance, I can save about $100. And what else? I can also get double the lenses for the price. This is perfect. Lenses are working great thus far, though I can't wait to save enough for a 50mm prime. I've gotten a few filters, a rechargeable battery, and a camera bag with the money I saved. Can't wait to go pro :)", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for stills......NOT a good choice for video!!!!!", "Author": "A.

If your primary use is going to be for still shots, by all means....get this camera.But, if you are looking for a good budget DSLR camera for video, I don't think you will be too happy with the K500.

I was experimenting with various combinations of settings and features. I love the in-camera anti-shake feature because all my old Takumar and SMC Pentax K-mount lenses can use it. Even my really old screw mount lenses work with it. It really does allow hand held slow shutter speeds! Sharp at 1/15 sec. Super high ISO speeds are grainy as expected but I am able to take pleasing pictures that are impossible with cameras limited 3200 ISO. The two kit lenses are not \"prime\" but they are very very good and sharp. The camera can automatically correct for distortion and chromatic aberration, two common attributes of most non-prime lenses. So why pay the prime price?  Viewfinder prism is top notch. Flash has good range.  Auto-focus is fast and accurate.All in all, it feels well made, solid, and durable. I've had it for only a month.  I will post again if it fails for any reason.
