Across the board, everything about it is just plain wrong.Powerline networking is a relatively good idea, but it looks like the marketing department at D-Link got together one day to see what kind of products they could cram it in to. With this surveillance camera, the implementation is sloppy and unnecessary.Keep in mind too, that Powerline networking isn't always as straightforward as plugging in a \"wall wort\" and connecting ethernet to it. If you're using any multi-outlet adapters, or if your home's wiring isn't nearly pristine, the experience can be almost as painful as just running CAT5 cable through your house.The camera itself is massive compared to any web cam made in the past decade, and assembling it to the base is needlessly complicated for what it is. On the plus side, the base is quite heavy, so it isn't going to be knocked down easily. On the other hand, you absolutely must use wall anchors if you plan to mount the camera on a wall. And given the size of this camera, it's so large and obvious that your baby and pets are the only ones who aren't going to notice it.Perhaps the most mind boggling issue I have with this kit, is that you can't host it yourself. To see what's on the camera, you have to go to D-Link's site (which is simply not possible if you aren't using Windows and Internet Explorer) and create an account. Once you've done that, you can only see the camera through D-Link's site.I'm not typically a paranoid person, but that really raised an \"Are you serious?\" from me. Why the heck would you have a camera in your home broadcasting to D-Link's site? What stops D-Link from peeking in? And perhaps more importantly, what happens if D-Link goes under, or decides that they're just not interested in offering the service anymore? More likely than not, you'll be left with expensive, useless junk.Don't get me wrong, I can see the value in offering a camera that \"just works\", but not having the option to host it yourself, and being locked in to Internet Explorer are ridiculous barriers.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "High potential but limited applications for very specific users", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R3EXZPDFDA28D1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "REQUIREMENTS:Broadband internet serviceRouter with available Ethernet portPC running Windows 2000/XP/Vista AND Internet Explorer + Active X SupportSorry Mac OS X users, including myself, it won't work on your Mac.

Design flaw numero uno ('Number One' for the non-Spanish, or in my case, Spanglish, speakers).WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:CameraCamera BaseMounting KitRouter Powerline AdapterCamera Powerline AdapterBlack Ethernet CableWhite Camera CableCamera Connection AdapterQuick Install GuideNote: User manual is downloaded from the manufacturer's website on D-Life.SETUPI have a Windows laptop, in addition to my Macbook Pro.  I set this up on the Windows laptop.  Assembly took 15 minutes.  Troubleshooting took 30 minutes.Assembly of the product is very simple in concept.  Installation of the camera, in theory is also simple.  Connect the broadband modem to the Powerline Adapter and plug in the adapter.  Connect the camera cable to the camera and plug the cable into the camera adapter, then plug it into the wall.  That is when simplicity stops:I had only the Powerline LED light up (not the Network LED).  I had to connect the Ethernet cable into the Camera Adapter (Strike 2) - What good is monitoring the office, if I cannot go wireless.  I proceed to check the product support on the D-Life Website and the solutions are listed below:\"Because Powerline Adapters use your home's electrical wiring to communicate with each other, try the following to troubleshoot your Powerline Adapters:Try plugging your Camera Powerline Adapter into a power outlet that is closer to your Router Powerline Adapter.If your Powerline Adapters are plugged into a power strip, try plugging them directly into a wall outlet.Make sure that the outlets that your Powerline Adapters are plugged into use the same electrical wiring circuit in your home. Some homes use different electrical circuits for different floors; in this case, your Powerline Adapters may not be able to communicate with each other when plugged into the different circuits of your home.Power-cycle the units by unplugging both units, then plugging them back in.If you still cannot get your Powerline Adapters to connect to each other, you can connect your adapter by directly connecting it to your Internet router.\"Ok, so I hook an Ethernet Cable directly to the Camera.  It has taken me, now 30 minutes, troubleshooting why the camera is offline.OPERATION OF THE CAMERATo operate the camera, you need to initialize an account on the D-Life website.  From there you verify your email address to active the account.  You have a Serial number and PIN code that is on your instruction sheet.  Rather than logging into the website each time, I chose to use the D-Life Widget which launches the device from a separate program (you can enter your email address and password to be saved by the widget), which in turn, launches Internet Explorer.There is a status icon showing your D-Life device(s) whether it is online, busy or offline.  Tabbed menus show Live Video, Snapshots, Sharing, Notifications.  Only 100 snapshots can be stored - email notification occurs if you reach your limit.  You can program your camera to be activated with motion through the website (not through hardware settings).  An email alert, which can be sent to 3 of your designated email accounts (with notification frequency and when your queue is full).  You can also send your snapshots to 15 email designees.Of note, you can purchase an accesory monitor to view this camera without using the internet.CAMERA QUALITYImage quality is decent (grainy appearance) but does not operate as well in low light.  Settings can be toggled for low light, brightness and motion detection.  Refresh rate of motion is low.  Sound can also be detected but not recorded or archived.PROSInternet driven camera for remote access.Simple set up for WINDOWS users using INTERNET EXPLORER.D-Life Widget for quicker access.User friendly and intuitive website.CONSNo support for other operating systems.If connecting on 'different circuits' the wireless capability is non-functional.If wireless capability is non-functional, your camera needs near the router for Ethernet connection.Camera Color and Adapter are different colors from the Router Adapter.Manual is only accessible as a PDF from the D-Life website.Solid internet support with video tutorial on installation.No motion picture capability.Requires Active X controls which may be limited for users on \"secure networks\" trying to view from work (i.e. Federal or Government Networks).Only 120 second intervals for a live feed.SUMMARYThis camera is only useful if you are operating on the same electrical circuit.  Otherwise, your camera needs to be next to the router.  The concept of this device is good but unfortunately, with specific requirements of operating systems/browser, this is going to have limited use.  Wireless range is rated at 300 meters (it wouldn't even work in the hallway 5 feet from the router).In my own household, the only use I have for it is the unauthorized use of my FAX machine/color printer since I cannot monitor something very far away (like the Lanai for golfers lurking in my backyard or watching my dog).If you are willing to deal with the limitations, then try it.  Otherwise, try other alternatives.  This gets one star for the website and one star for the concept. This lost one star for OS limits, lost one star for browser limits, and lost one star for limited wireless range.VERDICTNot recommended", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware!! Make Sure This Fits ALL of Your Requirements!", "Author": "EMTP EJ \"EJ\"", "ReviewID": "RPKKHEOJ16V8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Make sure that you have everything required before you buy and set it up:An XP or Vista PC with Internet explorer 6 or 7.When you set it up you have to install several ActiveX controls, so be prepared for that.An available Ethernet jack on your home network router and a fairly close proximity between the router and an electrical outlet that is not on a power strip.A broadband internet connection.An uncomplicated home electrical system and an available outlet near to where you want to place the camera.To mount it on something, you will need a drill or it has screws and anchors for sheetrock. So, you will need a hammer and screwdriver, at least. The mount is very sturdy and heavy and some people might get good results by just placing it on a bookcase and taping it down. This device connects to the internet through your router, so it does not need to be connected to a PC before being used which is good, but that also makes it a little harder to get it mechanically set up properly. To help with the set-up you might consider following the very large (but easy to follow) poster and running the web side of things from a wireless laptop, and then having that laptop in the room where you are setting up this camera. This way, you can adjust the orientation and focus of the device much easier, especially since you only have 2 minutes at a time to view the video live. The camera cable is flat and that might help you to hide it or at least make it less noticable.To make sure that this is (or is not) the camera that meets your needs, be sure and go to their website [..] and examine the features and requirements. Download and view the manual, too. That can really help you decide. At the time I got it, the Amazon product page for it was pretty sparse, which may explain why some people have been disappointed in the product's performance.Also be advised that all of the components produce some heat, which is why they all have ventilation grids on them. You may wish to take some care with locating the components so they get enough ventilation and are not too close to flammable items. I do not know if this system would interfere with any other powerline equipment (such as X-10) or powerline bridge networking equipment.It is supposed to be a `surveillance' camera, but it is kind of large to be a `hidden camera'. It might be useful to keep tabs on a pet or if someone enters a space they are not supposed to be in or if someone delivers something, but nothing very `covert'. I have wanted to have a camera that we can use to monitor our property and so I was very excited to try out this product. I had no connection problems from having the camera on the third floor (pointing through the window) of our house and the network adapter on the first floor. The setup for me went step by step as directed on the setup poster.I understand that the powerline bridge ($50 to $150) and the web-hosting costs some money, but the price point seems a little high at the time of this review. Other products may fit your needs and your budget a little better. If you are looking for a wireless webcam, you might consider one of the following:Linksys WVC54GCA Webcam 640x480 802.11G Wireless Internet Home Monitoring Camera or Linksys Compact Wireless-G Internet Video Camera or Panasonic BL-C131A Network Camera Wireless 802.11.Amazon also has some different products that provide powerline ethernet from D-Link and Linksys, etc. if you think that might be helpful.NETGEAR XE102G Wall-Plugged Ethernet Extender Kit or Linksys PLK200 Powerline AV Ethernet Adapter Kit orD-Link DHP-301 Powerline HD Ethernet Kit.I did not really expect much and for my purposes and my existing installation, this product works fine and setup was easy.Update -- I have had a problem with this device -- the live video freezes after 80 seconds (instead of after 120 seconds). Their tech support says it is my fault as my upload speed is not high enough. I guess if you make junk, the best thing to do is blame the buyer for being dumb enough to buy the product!

I called D-Link's 24-hour help line, but their automated system would just keep me on hold, then hang up on me (I have never been a fan of D-Link support).Eventually, I made sure both black and white bridge ends were plugged directly into a wall instead of a power strip, I figured out a way to open the D-Life email's link in IE vs. my default browser and I restarted the system a few times. It took awhile, but I got the surveillance kit working!The system operates via a collection of ActiveX controls, which essentially means you and the people you want to view your camera feed are limited to Internet Explorer, and only in environments where they can install ActiveX controls (many workplaces won't allow ActiveX installation on company machines). I wasn't happy with this limitation, but since IE is still the most pervasive browser, I imagine it won't be too much of an inconvenience for most.Also, even viewing the \"D-Life\" site is a bit awkward. If you try to view multiple pages on the site, it will eventually switch every window to the page you most recently viewed. Odd!Despite all of the awkwardness, however, it works! The camera runs and you can configure the unit to save pictures to the internet (where thieves can't steal the images if they break into your house). This, I believe, is the biggest selling point.I'm not sure I'd recommend the system, necessarily, but I can at least vouch that it does what it claims, with noted limitations.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Mac user beware....", "Author": "Karen Bierman Hirsh", "ReviewID": "R1PTRXLRUGCEIP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was very excited looking forward to being able the D-Link D-Life internet survelliance camera to keep an eye on things at home (most notable the dog who likes to eat things while we are out) - I was thrilled at how simple the camera seemed to install yet was very disappointed to discover that it does not really work on a mac.

Unfortunately, there are some limitations not made clear by the Amazon product description that was provided when selecting the product.  As a result, this camera can only be recommended for some users... definitely do your research before purchase to make sure it will suit your needs.The camera is touted as \"easy-to-install\" which is true.  Setup was pretty simple as it works over your wireless internet.  Once you set up the camera, you register on the D-Link website.  You must view the video through D-Link's website (no hosting on another website).  The description that it \"allows you to monitor any room in your house from anywhere over the internet\" led me to believe that I could view it not just on our computers, but also on our internet-capable devices like the iPod touch.The major con for me is that the device only works on Internet Explorer Versions 6 and 7.  I have a MacBook Pro and cannot access the camera through their website.  The latest version that you can download for a Mac is IE 5.3, which isn't compatible with the camera.  Unless your PDA uses Internet Explorer version 6 and 7, you won't be able to monitor it from that device.  IE Version 8 isn't supported yet.  I assume that D-Link's browser requirement is for security reasons, but it's pretty restrictive and a real bummer that other browsers like Safari and Firefox are not supported.While the camera isn't as versatile as I had hoped, we still can use my husband's desktop computer and netbook to monitor the camera.  Right now we have it inside our kitchen window pointed to the outside of our house.  (Note: it cannot be used outdoors, but can be pointed outdoors from inside your home).  You can set up the camera up to monitor for motion certain times of the day.  It will e-mail you an alert, then you can log-in to view the snapshots or a live feed.  This is a nice feature because you wouldn't want D-Link to constantly e-mail you about motion when you are home.  We are expecting our first baby and we could potentially use this as a video baby monitor as well, using my husband's netbook.  It would provide a much larger picture than a handheld monitor.  We'd probably want to use only the live feed option and not the motion detecting feature in this case.Overall, this is a nice camera but there are some restrictions that limit its versatility for some users.

Speaking from experience with getting webcams to work from the home, you just almost need a PhD (or have me for a son) to get these things working reliably.  You have to understand arcane things like port forwarding, be able to monkey around with DNS port forwarding on websites that often charge a fee, and make \"advanced\" changes to your router - just to get a single basic webcam working so you can view things remotely.  A few months ago I got a new home security system from [...] (who also sells on Amazon) and had my first experience with this powerline adapter technology - where IP signals are carried through your home's electrical system instead of wirelessly.  It worked really well - and on a whim, I decided to try this D-Link starter kit.  While very basic, it is by far the easiest system I've seen to setup and install - I was up-and-running in about 10 minutes.  Their d-life website completely takes the DNS hassle out of this and handles everything behind the scenes.  I would recommend this package to my 65 year old mother - who could easily figure this out without my help .  I read many of the reviews on this site for this product - I really can't imagine why anyone would have problems with this.  It's very entry-level and basic - so you can't expect too much.  Sure I'd like to have a full PTZ (pan / tilt / zoom) camera, be able to view for longer than 120 seconds, and have more control over the camera in general - but this package is very good for what it is.  The ONLY problem I had is that my home is on 2 different electrical panels(we had a large addition done - seperate panel) and one side of my house is basically invisable to the D-link \"server\", since it's next to my router on the other side of the house.

John \"military mom\"", "ReviewID": "R2G0LEXFAAAHSF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really excited to get this so I decided to try everything in my power to make it work. First off, the makers made it compatible with IE6 which made it difficult to use since we have IE8. Forget it if you have Safari, Firefox, Opera etc. So since I couldn't use it on my computer, I decided to hook it up to the kids who had the older IE6 browser.I must admit that the set up is pretty easy once you have the right requirements but once it's up and running it was a let down. To operate the camera though you first have to get an account on the D-Life website, but as I said before you need IE6 to do that. You can only view live video and there is no way to record.If you plan on using this at work or elsewhere to see what's happening in your home, be prepared to not be able to. If it's supposed to be a Security Camera, I would have thought they would have made it so more users could use it, thus the 2 stars.All in all it's very limited in what it can do.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Does not work with Mac OSX", "Author": "Scott Richardson", "ReviewID": "R2KDKHBT530TGD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I picked this up because I thought it would work with my Mac.

Kooiman \"nerdette\"", "ReviewID": "R2GP7AQJ5FQ63S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was looking forward to using this product to watch what goes on in my home while I'm away but am really disappointed because, after trying several things, cannot get it to display live video.  I've contacted support and their response was \"sounds like you have an issue with anti-virus software\".  They did not offer things to try to correct the problem nor contact information to discuss with a human being.  This being said, straight out of the box, the product has the following pros and cons:Pros:1.  Very easy setup.Provided you have a router that has an open ethernet port, you simply plug one component into the router and into a wall outlet.  It lights up to let you know it's connected.  If you do not have an extra ethernet port, you are provided (or can download) instructions to get it to work.Next you plug one end of a cable into the camera and the other end into the component that plugs in to another wall outlet and it's set up and ready to use.2.  Website setup is pretty simple.  You are provided a card with the necessary information to register your device with the d-life website.3.  You can schedule through the website when the camera is active and it is simple to do so.  You can also set the camera to take snapshots when motion is detected during the hours the camera is active.4.  You can setup the website to send you an email when motion is detected. You can also set the frequency that you want those emails sent so you don't get an email every few minutes if something just keeps moving - like the clouds over the sun.5.  you can set the sensitivity of the motion detection.  I set it to high and the clouds going over the sun created lots of snapshots but when set to low, the dog jumping on the sofa didn't trigger anything.6.  The website will send you an email if you are getting close to the limited number of snapshots.  This is handy if you have a cloudy day (like I did) and sensitivity set to \"high\" AND the dog keeps jumping from one sofa to the other to get comfortable.CONS:1.  The website requires the use of active X controls.  This means the ONLY browser you can use is Internet Explorer.  In addition, you will probably have to alter your security settings to allow popups and to allow certain functionality for active X controls.  You have to do this carefully or you will suddenly find yourself dealing with obnoxious popups or, worse, a virus that found a backdoor through active X.2.  The instruction manual is only available online and is somewhat incomplete.  There is very little troubleshooting help so if you have a problem, you have a problem.  Good luck.3.  The website is extremely slow.  After I created my account and registered my device, I waited as much as 10 minutes for a screen change.4.  Hopefully this is just my issue - after allowing popups and allowing all kinds of great functionality with Active X, I was never asked to download an important control and so the view live video now button remains greyed out.  Support was no help.  I tried to view video with two different computers with the same results.  Apparently, some anti-virus software can prevent viewing the live video.  I would normally be using the camera when I am away from home and at work.  The anti-virus software on the work computer cannot (and should not) be disabled so I cannot view the live video.5.  Picture quality is not good enough.  When you have the camera set up to record when motion is detected you get 5 frames.  However, whatever was moving to trigger the snapshots is a massive blur.All in all, the problems I have with watching live video is enough for me to put this gadget back in it's box and not recommend it for other users.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "\"It Just Works\" (as long as you are using a PC and IE6 otherwise not so much)", "Author": "@homemom", "ReviewID": "RHMGK68XPHD07", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The homepage for D-Life has the tag line \"It just works\" yet for me, next to that is a little box explaining that it only works using internet explorer 6 or higher. So for me, on a macbook it does not in fact work at all.I was so excited to see this product, there is very little info here on amazon so I checked the dlink product page for it: [...] and reading it I was beyond excited over the potential. I have a reef fish tank I've spent more money then I care to admit on and when we go on vacation I'm forever worried about my fish & corals and figured this camera would be the perfect solution... I could view my tank over my laptop while traveling.Per the website:ANYWHERE ACCESS TO YOUR CAMERA VIDEO FEEDWatch your video feed or view the status of your camera(s) anytime from anywhere over the Internet, whether you are at home or at the office - just sign in to the D-Life website.

Anyone else notice no mention that in order to view the camera you have to be using a PC running IE6? I didn't notice that either because it's not anywhere on that product page. Digging further into the website specs and you'll see it requires a PC with IE6 however it isn't clear that in order to view remotely you must also be using IE6.I have a PC with IE at home, so I connected the camera to my D-Line router (which for the record I love) and it was found immediately, setup did take a bit longer then I expected with me having to approve numerous activex popups. Finally I was able to view the live feed (I had the camera upstairs aimed at my tank) and sure enough there it was, though the lighting was awful even though it's midafternoon and the room is bright. You get 120 seconds of live viewing before you have to refresh.You say \"I'm running a windows computer and I use IE6 so I don't care about your complaints\" well... one of the big selling features is that you can share live views with others.... well you can, but specifically only 15 of them and they can only view your live feed if they are also using IE6+ and only if they sign up for their own D-Life account. So much for sending a simple link someone can click on.Two stars because the technology is amazing, having it run though the homes power lines and plugging directly into a router is very neat and allows so many options in placement but this is mute to me if the camera is useless for those running anything other then IE6+.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "limited useage", "Author": "D \"D\"", "ReviewID": "R19U2YDQ7UVMOA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited about this, I wanted a security camera but this is not a good deal and I would not have gotten this if I had known just how limited it is.
