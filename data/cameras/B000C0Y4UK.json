It comes aready at 50HZ so if your having problems with it beeping and flashing and the picture still not right that is it.  It is slow to relize your pushing buttons but it does respond.  In the container I got the cord(usb), bag, batteries, and carry string.  I love it.", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Warren Christensen \"Wo\"", "ReviewID": "R3HSEAOGA04SRW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had had this camera for 3 months now and I can't tell you had much I love it.  It has many more fetures than I would ever use but there are some drawbacks to this item. First, in low light conditions you must hold this camera steady after pushing the button or your pics come out blurred. Other than that it is a well made product.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "My Old Camera is Better", "Author": "Insert Cool Name Here \"Flow\"", "ReviewID": "R2ESDXQRDAZKCX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera from another site thinking it was a wonderful price for a 5.1 MP camera and a flip screen. The light sensor seems to be out of whack. Every picture I take inside without the flash ends up having a red hue (no matter what I change the setting to) and when I do use the flash many times the person is whited out. Even my old HP 3.1 MP takes better pictures, and I was buying another camera to replace it. It also can't take vertical pictures, as in when I turn the camera, the viewfinder shows it as sideways or upside down, which I found weird because I've never known a camera to do that. And when I did take a vertical picture, there was no rotate feature to be found on the camera. It also makes this annoying 'beep' when I take a picture. I'm the type of person who likes to take pictures without another person noticing and the beep is neither inconspicuous or desirable.Other than that I really have no problem with it. It lets me change what size I want the pictures to be, which is good, I guess, even though I'll just resize them on my computer; it comes with a nice carrying case, it's a good size, and again--I love that the viewfinder flips out and that the view can be flipped as well. Had I had known everything about it before I spent my savings on it, I wouldn't have wasted my money or my time, but I suppose I can live with it now that I have it.", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not so great.....", "Author": "A. Reece", "ReviewID": "R3AU3C5W4GITK1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I thought with this being a 5mp camera it would have great resolution....not true I have found.  My pictures come out fuzzy, the coloring looks weird no matter what setting I have it on and I can't take pictures close up without catching a lot of glare.  Also I can't take pictures in any kind of low lighted place.  I think I actually got better pictures with my Kodak 2.1 MP camera.", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price and outstanding customer service!", "Author": "L. Frenz", "ReviewID": "RJH238S770OTW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Polaroid's outstanding customer service makes this camera an excellent purchase. I received the camera in exchange for a less expensive, different model camera that had a defect. The exchange was made quickly and easily.The camera is easy to use and has more features than I expected from an inexpensive camera. Picture quality is better than one should expect from an inexpensive camera. At the highest resolution a picture can be zoomed to display excellent detail.Polaroid A500 5.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Digital Zoom", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "What a Piece of Junk", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R1R8OEX2B73WBO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a gift for my 9 year old daughter.  When I selected the entry-level/beginner camera, it was largely based on price - $50 at Target. I studied the product packaging before buying it to determine whether I needed to purchase a memory card as well... Absolutely no indication on the outside of the package. That would be nice to know before gifting it!She was excited to receive the gift but highly disappointed that she could not use it until we made another trip to the store.The camera construction is light and flimsy.  The control buttons are so small that they're difficult to engage. All images on the viewer were extremely blurry and the photos that we uploaded to the PC were likewise blurry. The images were so bad that we checked several times for a plastic lens cover. There is no cover to protect the lens when the device is stuffed into a pocket or bag so I see this as a long term issue (or short term issue for a child). The sole positive:  it was easy to transfer photos to my PC.I checked Polaroid's website for downloadable documentation or troubleshooting and could not quickly find anything.Rather than trying to make lemonade, I'm taking this lemon back and moving on to another manufacturer.If you're considering the Polaroid a500, put it back on the shelf and move on. There's a reason that this once trusted name has twice filed for bankruptcy.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "So disappointed", "Author": "Tracy Givens \"jobgem\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q9DITWLP60NP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera was not worth the money spent.  The pictures, no matter the setting come out blurry, too dark, too light or odd looking.  Go for a different camera.

Every picture I take that is not naturally lit comes out fuzzy no matter what I do.  There are horrible glare problems, the flash lag is very frustrating as well as the lag between pictures.  When the flash is reloading you can't do anything else on the camera - it is like it's frozen - not even turn the camera off or use the menu.  The camera has a cheap plastic feel, the LCD screen is pretty small.  Overall, this is a camera I would give to my 7 year old daughter.  If you want good pictures go somewhere else.  I would recommend the Nikon Coolpix series or the Sony DSPs.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE picture quality", "Author": "Sugar \"online shopper\"", "ReviewID": "RCQM9D6OVFREH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I tried over and over to convince myself that this camera will get better as time goes by, and I am done trying.
