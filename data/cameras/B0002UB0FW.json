As a camera, it does okay.  I carry it around with me everywhere so I won't miss any of those \"Kodak moments\"  It's nice to have a digital camera in general.  I don't feel like I'm wasting film taking silly pictures; I'm much more likely to just go wild with my picture taking.  On the other hand, I think that there are certain things about this particular camera that aren't up to par.First, and I know this is a problem with many digitals, the lag time between taking photos is sometimes very short, but sometimes up to 4 or 5 seconds (which is a lot when you have people standing in front of you smiling and waiting, or you want to catch an action shot)The most upsetting problem for me is if you turn the flash off, even in well lit areas with a low resolution selected, the picture will come out blurry, unless you have it on a tripod or something stable.  It took me awhile to figure out why all my pictures were blurry, I thought I had perhaps received a bad camera.  After much experimenting I discovered that with the flash on, I took wonderfully crisp photos, with it off, I took blurry junk.To go along with the previous problem, the flash is _very_ bright.  All the pictures I have taken of my boyfriend are of him squinting at me.  On the other hand, most other people don't seem to have as much of a problem.Those are the only complaints I have, everything else is wonderful.  The pictures do come out nice if you leave the flash on.  The computer software is easy to use, the camera menus are easy to navigate.  There are built in settings for taking portraits, landscapes, action shots etc, all the same stuff that you see on most point and shoots nowadays.  You can adjust various settings manually as well, although I think the built in ones are fine.  To me, if you want to manually adjust stuff, you buy an SLR.  I haven't used the video camera part yet, to be honest I forgot it even has that ability til I read about it in the description.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "What a bargain!!!", "Author": "Mark Prospero \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "RFT5U0DYJ8IFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been an Olympus buff since my first digi in 2001 I was wary of switching brands to the up and comer in the digital world Vivitar, particularily because some of thier lower end cameras got some dreadful reviews (as lower end cameras often will!).Nonetheless two hours out of the box, and I knew I had a winner!The camera weight,size,build quality,and lens are outstanding! how ever all that means next to nothing if the picture quality is not great which it really is, color is really spectacular and vivid, strangely you do get a slight red hue under tungstun light though.The Auto setting is really great and the feature where it actually tells you what it is doing when it is doing it (changing ISO, aperature, etc.) is something I have never seen before and really appretiate.The flash is very nice as it does not over-power the subject as I have seen on many olympus and canon cameras, the drawback of this is of course is that it dosen't throw the flash as far, some make sure you are close enough or have sufficient lighting.I cannot believe I actually use the digital zoom! although don't go over the 3x mark or pic quality really bugs out.I could really go over the features forever but I won't.Video is OK for emailing short clips but not great.2.2\" screen phenominal!I could go on but I won't.For the price of this camera you really shouldn't have any reservations buying it I compare the camera to Canons, and Olympuses of two to three times the cost.You'll still be able to afford that 528mb SD card!", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Vivicam 4000", "Author": "K. Mooney \"Take it Literally\"", "ReviewID": "RHUEXKCBXXTFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been such a wonderful camera.  I purchased it for $199 in May 2005.  The sharpness cannot be beat.  However, I recently needed to get a replacement because my toddler got a hold of it and somehow jammed the lens (it won't go back in or back out all the way and just won't work anymore \"ERROR 2\").At Christmas, I ended up getting my hubby a Canon Powershot S2 IS - which is just too bulky to tote around and doesn't take such sharp photos!  I was disappointed because I thought it would be at least close to the Vivitar quality.The replacement camera I chose for myself was the Vivitar 6320.  It is a very nice camera too, but the DELAY seems even longer. Plus, I was so spoiled with the long-lasting rechargable battery of the 4000, that I'm not sure I can get over it.  The 6320 takes AA batteries which need to be changed after a dozen or so photos (I haven't tested them shooting video yet.)  So, if you have the Vivitar 4000 camera...take good care of it.  It's the best!!!", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "This camera is the same as the Traveler DC6300 from Aldi", "Author": "M. Keep", "ReviewID": "R22RS6MH31DMWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Which is where I bought mine.It is a great value little digital camera, and competes really favourably with the Canons et al of this world.Prints are fine and crisp.The blurriness mentioned in a comment above is a complete non issue, since it is a phenomenon common to ALL other cameras. When taking pictures at low light without flash, even a trustly SLR will give you a blurry image if you can't hold it steady while the shutter is open for longer.However, beware of battery problems. Mine stopped being able to hold any charge after 1 year of ownership and I was forced to buy replacements.My father bought the same camera at the same time and had exactly the same battery problem as well.But for that it would have been 5 stars.", "Date": "January 27, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0002UB0FW"}}
