Which is kinda worthless. I bought it, thinking it was 4MP, thinking I would have excellent shots with it! But when I tried it out, pictures were really bad!! And it doesnt have a flash so... 2M is like emailing quality so.. dont be fooled, it says 4 MP everywhere, i got fooled too, but when I looked closer (too late) i saw it only had a 2mp sensor, this is with most of those cheap models.IT DOES HAVE AN EXCELLENT webcam functionality!! its a great webcam cause most webcams are only 1.3 MP. And it'll probably be a good mp3 listener too.", "Date": "April 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "sorry to say, when you first get it , it is like \" is this a real camera ? \" , it looks so tiny but, it delivers everything it p", "Author": "john hancock", "ReviewID": "RSGEKMQ8H161T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "sorry to say, when you first get it , it is like \" is this a real camera ? \" , it looks so tiny but, it delivers everything it promises.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple Basic Old Technology Poor Quality Video &  Bad Drivers/Software", "Author": "Johnny Electromechtech \"Johnny\"", "ReviewID": "RMQT0EGG2ORQE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good Day All! I hope you're enjoying a pleasant one. I bought my Mustek DV-3500 used on Ebay for about 20 bucks grand total... it came complete with the box and all included contents. I like the heavy duty USB cable with the toroids on either end. The owner also gave me a small tripod which was a plus. The camera is old technology I guess. It may have been great in its heyday... but not so now. I believe even the cheapest Dollar Store digital video camera has better features, software, and video quality.It really all boils down to the video quality... which... on this unit... is poor. It doesn't do well in low light conditions and doesn't have a headlight or hotshoe for placing a headlight. I'm only a very amateur digital photographer... all I can say is... if you want a nice pic with this camera you better have decent light.The sound recording works great. While recording a video, I noticed that the camera does a great job recording sound... I'm using it on the tripod, setting on a stool, to record my 78 Rpm records playing... for YouTube videos associated with Ebay listings and classified ads. I take some outdoor video of my sweetheart and our dogs occasionally. So for me... it's Ok.I still would like better video quality, working drivers, and even some simple usable software for Windows XP Home... I'm using Google Picasa for creating videos to upload to YouTube. My still picture cameras, both Kodak, also do video about as good if not better than this Mustek. I was hoping being a Digital Video Camera, the Mustek would outshine my still cameras... not so.The really bad part is that the Driver Software doesn't work. You can download the latest version from the Mustek web site... but I'll bet it doesn't work for you. I searched the web... and didn't find anyone who got it to work with Windows XP or Vista or anything. I haven't found any software really integrates with the camera and knows it's there... plugged in.Fortunately though, Windows recognizes it enough that you can get the files off of it. It works great as a storage medium. Windows will also ask you what you want to do with the files on the camera... and you can choose from whatever list of programs it presents to you. I find it convenient to just choose Picasa and place the pics/videos in a folder of the current date.The Menu on the camera is also lackluster. The Advertising says it can do Video Soundtrack... but I guess you need the software to work for something like that. But again, fortunately you can import the video files (ASF File Extensions) to your favorite photo/video editing program (I use Piicasa) and do whatever with them.I bet it would make a nice WebCam! ...if you can find the drivers and software that will recognize the camera and work with it... if anybody knows of any... post the link in a review or something.Enough said... if you want an affordable, useable digital video camera, keep an eye on the Dollar Store Ads and sales... get an Emerson or something for 30 to 40 dollars.Enjoy Everything!John B.Mustek DV-3500 Digital Camera w/Digital Video, Voice Recorder, and MP3 Capability", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best camera ever!!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R20PGOS0V6H3XN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best camera EVER, but it would be better if it came with a USB cable, like it's supposed to.Then it would be really AWESOME!!", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not Bad pictures", "Author": "T.

Finally decided to try taking pictures.  The first pictures I took didn't turn out that great.  It turns out theres settings where you can choose the quality of the picture.  I am not sure why this is since most people I know would almost always prefer top quality pictures.It takes pretty decent pictures and I plan to use it more now that I know it takes pretty good pictures.  I just need to purchase an SD card to use so that I can take more pictures.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0002E83VM"}}
