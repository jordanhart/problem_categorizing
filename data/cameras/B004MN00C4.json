{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Choosing between the T3i, T2i, 60D and 7D", "Author": "dojoklo", "ReviewID": "R5O3RQJXIOBDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Rebel T3i takes the consumer level dSLR a couple steps closer to the mid-level Canon 60D with the addition of the rotating rear LCD screen, remote flash firing, and in-camera processing features.  The already highly competent, older Rebel T2i already shared many important features with the 60D (and even features of the semi-pro 7D) including the 18 MP sensor, 63-zone exposure metering system, high ISO performance, HD movie capabilities, and Digic 4 image processor.  With these new upgrades, it might make it even more difficult to choose between them.  But there are some important differences.If you are considering the Rebel T3i vs T2i, the Rebel T3i is replacing the T2i.  Since both cameras share the same 18 megapixel sensor and Digic 4 processor, both the T2i and T3i will create images with exactly the same image quality, produce the same low light/ high ISO performance, shoot at 3.7 frames per second, and have nearly the same size and build quality.  They are both offered with the same 18-55mm kit lens (with some minor cosmetic differences on the new T3i kit lens).  The T3i is very slightly larger and heavier due to the addition of the rotating rear LCD monitor.  And that is one of the biggest differences between the two cameras.  Do you want and need a vari-angle rear screen or not?  The other major difference is the ability of the T3i to remotely control multiple off-camera flashes.  Like the 60D and 7D, you can use the built-in flash of the T3i to trigger other Canon Speedlites.  Some other minor additions to the T3i include the Scene Intelligent Auto Mode, which is a feature borrowed from point and shoot cameras.  When in Auto mode, the T3i will make a determination of what type of scene you are shooting - close-up, portrait, landscape, etc. - and automatically configure the camera settings accordingly.  However, if you want to use a powerful and costly digital SLR as a point and shoot, you should probably save the money and just buy a nice, high quality point and shoot like the Canon S95.  Other additional but not essential upgrades include the in-camera processing Creative Filters, and the ability to choose different image size ratios and to rate your images.  (Helpful hint: press the Q Button while in image playback and you can access features like rating, rotating, and Creative Filters.)  There is also a marginally helpful Feature Guide which gives brief descriptions of various settings and some additional video features like Video Snapshot, which you can use to shoot short video clips that are automatically joined together into a video, with music.Canon Rebel T3i  vs. 60D vs. 7DSensor and Image Quality:  All three cameras share a very similar sensor and 18 megapixels, and so their image quality will be virtually the same.  All are capable of taking professional quality images.Exposure Metering: The three cameras all share the latest 63-zone, dual-layer exposure metering system and 4 metering modes. That means they will all determine the exposure virtually identically and enable you to take properly exposed photos in most every situation, including difficult back-lit scenes. The size of the areas metered for Partial and Spot metering vary slightly between the cameras, but that isn't anything critical.Autofocus: The T3i shares a similar autofocus system to the 60D, with 9 focus points and three auto focusing modes. However the 9 AF points of the 60D are more sensitive than those of the T3i: all are cross-type in the 60D, only the center is cross-type in the T3i. The 60D autofocus system is much less complex than the sophisticated AF system of the 7D with its 19 AF point system and its additional Zone, Spot, and Expansion focus modes.  These various modes address how you want to deal with and group the numerous AF points.  Plus the custom settings of the 7D allow one to customize how the AF system works - how it tracks subjects, how it deals with objects that come between you and your initial subject, how quickly it responds to these changes of possible subjects that are at different distances from you, etc.  However, if you are not an avid sports photographer, a wildlife shooter, or someone who understands, needs, and will use the elaborate features of the 7D AF system, then this shouldn't sway you.Construction: As you can probably figure out from the prices, each camera is not built the same. The T3i has relatively strong construction of a stainless steel frame with polycarbonate body.  The 60D has a stronger and lighter aluminum frame and polycarbonate body, but not as strong as the 7D's magnesium alloy construction. The 60D also has some amount of weather sealing - more than the T3i, less than the 7D. But for most users, including even those using the camera daily or in travel situations, the construction of any of these cameras is far more than good enough, strong enough, and durable enough.ISO: Since they all share a very similar sensor, the ISO sensitivity and performance at high ISO settings is virtually the same for these three cameras. But don't take my word for it, don't be swayed by pixel peepers on forums, instead check out the camera sensor tests at dxomark to verify this.  As you can see, they all share the exact same overall score, and show very similar performance.Controls: As with construction, the buttons and controls vary with these cameras. Unlike the T3i, the 60D and 7D have nearly every control an advanced photographer needs on the exterior of the camera and they also have the top LCD panel and rear Quick Control Dial that are not on the T3i. With all the cameras, any controls can also be easily accessed with the Q Button and Q Menu or in the other menus on the rear LCD monitor. The top buttons of the 60D set only one setting each, so this is less complicated than the multiple-setting buttons of the 7D. Canon has removed the white balance (WB) button on the 60D that the 7D has, but that isn't a big deal - use the Q Menu. Another change on the 60D is that the Multi-controller has been moved from the thumb joystick like the 7D and 50D and placed in the middle of the rear Quick-control dial. This doesn't change how it functions, and should just be a matter of getting used to the difference.  If you plan on using your camera on Auto or Program most of the time, then the controls of the T3i are more than sufficient for your needs.  If you work in Av, Tv, or M modes and need quicker and more direct access to your controls and the additional top LCD screen to view and change your current settings, then you need to consider the 60D or 7D over the T3i.Menus and Custom Functions: These allow for greater control over customizing how the camera functions.  The T3i has less Menu and Custom Function setting options than the 60D, and the 7D has yet a few more than the 60D. These settings enable you to customize the operation, function, and controls to work how you want them to, including things like exposure increments, peripheral illuminations correction for lenses (fixes dark corners), tweaking how the autofocus system operates, setting more precise white balance settings, and customizing which button does what.  There are ebooks such as my Canon T3i Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation With the Canon Rebel T3i / EOS 600D and Your World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60D which walk you through all of the Menu settings and Custom Function settings so that you can set up your camera to work best for how you photograph, and also begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR camera.Wireless Flash: Like the 7D and 60D, the T3i incorporates wireless flash triggering. This allows you to trigger multiple off camera flashes at different output levels. The T2i does not have this feature.Articulating LCD Screen: The big new feature that the 60D and T3i have that the 7D and T2i do not is the articulating rear LCD screen. This may prove useful for videographers, as well as for setting up compositions while the camera is on a tripod, for macro use, or for using it from unusually low or high vantage points. Some users will be able to avoid buying an expensive angle finder because of this feature. There is also an electronic level in the 7D and 60D, visible in the viewfinder, rear LCD, or top LCD.Viewfinder: The T3i has a pentamirror viewfinder with 95% coverage of the actual resulting image.  The 60D has a large, bright pentaprism viewfinder with 96% coverage, not quite as nice as the nearly 100% view of the 7D pentaprism.Processor: The T3i shares the same Digic 4 processor as the 60D. The 7D has dual Digic 4 processors. However, if you don't need to shoot dozens of continuous images, you probably won't notice any processing speed issues.Continuous Shooting Speed: The T3i can shoot 3.7 frames per second.  The 7D can shoot a blazing 8 frames per second, in which the photos barely change from frame to frame.  The 60D can shoot a respectable 5.3 fps which is actually a more useful rate.  If you need the extremely high fps for sports, wildlife, or other action shooting, get the 7D.  If not, don't be swayed by this excessive feature.Memory Card: The T3i and 60D use the SD memory card.  The 7D uses the CF card.Battery: The T3i and T2i use the smaller LP-E8 battery with less capacity than the LP-E6 battery used by the 60D and 7D.Size and Weight: The T3i is smaller and lighter than the 60D, which in turn is smaller and lighter than the 7D.  Go to a store and hold them to get a better feel for their size, weight, and feel.  The 60D and 7D \"feel\" like the more substantial cameras that they are.  A nice improvement of the T3i is that its hand grip area has been modified, and has a different feel than that of the T2i - the area where the thumb rests is contoured differently and has a nice channel for the thumb, which allows for a much more secure one-hand-grip of the camera.AF Microadjustment: The 7D has this feature, the 60D and T3i and T2i do not.  This allows you to adjust the focus of each of your lenses in case any of them are slightly front-focusing or back-focusing.Locking Mode Dial: This is a new feature for a Canon dSLR, only on the 60D, that keeps the Mode dial from accidentally rotating. A nice touch.Full HD video: Of course they all offer this capability.  Note that this is not video for your kids' parties and soccer games.  It does not have continuous autofocus while shooting, as a camcorder does.  It is not designed for that kind of use, but rather for serious videographers who typically manually focus.  You can adjust autofocus while shooting by pressing the shutter button or the AF button, but it may have a less than desired looking result and unless you are using an external microphone, the autofocusing sound will be picked up.  The T3i has the digital zoom feature in video, which allows for nice smooth zooms while filming.Flash Sync: the 60D and T3i do not have a PC sync flash socket to plug in PC sync cords for off camera flash use.  The 7D has this.  However, they all offer wireless remote flash capability with the built in flash as a commander.Ease of operation: While beginners may find all the buttons, controls, and menus of any dSLR difficult and confusing at first, the menus and controls of the T3i and T2i are pretty basic and simple to learn for a dedicated user.  The additional controls and menus of the 7D and 60D are all quite intelligently designed, intuitive, and straightforward for the more advanced user.  Again, have a look at helpful guides such as my Canon T3i Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation With the Canon Rebel T3i / EOS 600D and Your World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60D to begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR cameras.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Busy Mom/The Family Photographer - T3i a great intro dSLR", "Author": "W. Edwards", "ReviewID": "R3AMTDCW73QB03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a camera expert, but rather, I'm a busy mom who likes to take pictures and who adores my subjects. This, then, is a review from a mom/amateur's point of view.MY GOALS/EXPECTATIONS:I have always been a photo fiend, taking my camera everywhere and pulling it out at any opportunity. While I'd gotten to a decent level of archiving important moments with my point-and-shoot cameras over the years, I wanted to take my photography to the next level. I was inspired by my brother-in-law's photos of his kids to take the dSLR plunge. But I knew (and still know), very little about professional photography. I wanted to start taking better photos right away. But I also wanted to have room to grow as a photographer and a camera that would grow with me.I also wanted the focus to stay firmly on my family - while I was willing to invest some time and care into the camera, I didn't want it to become like a pet I had to constantly watch over. While any dSLR takes some care and consideration, I've found the T3i has been an excellent camera for me and I've been quite pleased with it.PROS:* VERY USER FRIENDLY: The auto mode (or auto without flash, my favorite) is highly forgiving, taking fantastically sharp images, true to color. They look so clear that I feel I'm capturing as close to real life as I've ever seen before in a camera.* FAST: While I sometimes go in for trying out new modes and manual settings, I often leave the camera in auto or auto-sans-flash mode and just click away so that I can at least capture a moment before it's gone. I then play with manual settings if my kids stay still long enough for me to try something new. My previous cameras always had a horrible delay for the autofocus (the only mode they usually had), meaning I nearly always lost the moment when the toddler was on the move. The t3i is so ridiculously fast that I can snap multiple pics in the time one picture took before.* BEAUTIFUL PICTURES: This kind of goes without saying at this tier of camera, but the pictures are just amazing quality. Coming from the land of point-and-shoot, I'm pretty blown away. And I know I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg for what's possible.* BEAUTIFUL VIDEO: This is the nice new feature of the t3i. I wasn't sure I'd want or need the HD video. But hey, when you've got it, you use it. I've gotten some amazingly clear footage of the kiddo playing in the park with daddy and I'm so glad we went for the model with that feature.* BIG, CLEAR DISPLAY: It's really easy to see what pics you've just taken and adjust your photo-taking accordingly. Just by seeing what I've gotten, I'm able to try again and improve a shot almost immediately.* CLEAR MENUS/ABILITY TO IMPROVE: The interface on this is so intuitive that I've been able to learn a lot without even cracking open the manual (though that manual is my new reading material). The entry point for a new user is just a step up from normal photography - the possibilities, however, are nearly endless.* NICE KIT LENS: For all that photographers get into new and better lenses, the kit lens on this is really nice and easy to use. I think it will hold us for a good long while before I get to be more of an expert. It gives me the range of zoom and focus I need for now.* EYE-FI COMPATIBLE: WOW. I cannot even tell you how much I love this feature. If you get an eye-fi card, your pictures can be set up to automatically upload to your computer whenever you are within range of your synched wireless network. My husband set up a SmugMug account and the eye-fi capabilities. I take pics to my heart's content while out on walks, in the park, etc., and come home, then leave the camera on (auto-shut off after 8 minutes) to upload the pics. I can then tag and sort pictures later at my leisure. For me, this is amazingly useful. I don't have to take time out of my day to upload the pics - the camera does that for me.* BATTERY LIFE (for common use): So far, the battery we bought for the camera lasts very well during normal photo-taking. It's just a standard Canon battery for the rebel line and it charges quickly. Even when taking pics like a mad-woman, it lasts through a shoot. HD video eats it up more quickly, so be warned. Still, I rarely run out of juice during the day so long as I pop the battery into its charger in the evening. However, uploading is another story (See below in cons).Those are just the first few things I love about this camera. Here, however, are the...not cons, really, just challenges:CHALLENGES:* dSLRs ARE EXPENSIVE, DELICATE, BIG AND BULKY:And parents have enough precious and delicate things to worry about - namely, the kids. No getting around it - you can't just toss a dSLR into a pocket and go. I'm in a quest for a good bag/carrying solution (heh, yeah, wish me luck with that.) and I'm trying to get used to having one part of my brain keeping an eye on the camera as well as keeping the majority of my focus on the kids. When I'm in photo-journalist mode, it's no problem, but switching back to mom-mode is the hard part. I've already seen the camera knocked onto the ground (a very short distance onto very soft ground, so it was okay, but still, the experience practically gave me a heart attack) and once, when bending over, I caught the toddler on the temple with the kit lens (She sobbed. I felt so awful!) This thing requires constant awareness to both the camera AND the kids when using it. I'm quickly adjusting, but if you're not totally committed to learning to use and love the dSLR, you may want to stick to really good point-and-shoot camera if you're a busy parent.^ That's the big one.* BATTERY LIFE (when uploading pics via eye-fi): Uploading pictures by eye-fi seems to eat the battery alive. It appears that the camera won't autoshutoff when uploading, so this morning, after a few hours of uploading big, glorious pictures to my SmugMug account, the battery finally ran out of juice. I wish there was a plug-in mode or some sort of docking-station I could plug the camera into when I return home. If it's only a few pics, they upload and the camera shuts itself off. But if it's a bunch of pics (and when the weather's nice and the lighting's good, I take a lot of pics), the camera requires a battery recharge just to finish uploading my pictures.* SWIVEL SCREEN WORRIES: I find that the swivel screen, while hugely useful, is something I constantly worry that I'm going to snap off. However, you can keep it closed with the screen facing in(a nice feature) or tuck it onto the camera with the screen facing out. I also find if I'm looking out of the eye-piece, I leave cheek smudges all over the screen when its facing out.* MANUAL-MODE GOOFS: Some of my manual mode forays have been less than stellar. I've taken a shot - set up so nice, focus just perfect, subject just so... only to find out I left it in white-balance adjustment for indoors and I was outdoors so the whole picture looks like I dipped it in blue. I've learned to take pics in auto-mode first before experimenting too much. I also learned to check the screen a LOT before proceeding.SUMMARY: While the dSLR has required me to make some adjustments for including it in my busy life, I really love this camera, am pleased with the investment, am inspired by its ease of use, and I LOVE the pictures I've gotten of my family.5 STARS: And so I give it 5 stars - my whole point in buying a nice camera was to make and preserve FAMILY memories - and the t3i records those memories beautifully - in .jpg, raw, or HD video - with a minimum of dSLR fuss.*** UPDATE: about 6 months later ***STILL AWESOME:  I totally stand by the above review. If anything, I've come to adore this camera even more than I did when we first got it. When baby #2 arrived, the quality of pictures that we got far surpassed the pictures from the first baby's photo shoots. I'm truly pleased with this investment, as the pictures we get are lovely, clear, true-to-light/true-to-color, and just capture the memories so well. Really, this is EXACTLY what I was hoping for as an amateur photographer/mom.GOT BETTER:Battery Woes: We invested in an A/C adapter for the camera and now no longer eat the battery alive when leaving the camera to upload pictures via the Eye-Fi connection. It's a little annoying to have to swap over to the A/C and then back to a battery all the time - I would rather have a charging station of sorts - but it works and it means I stick the battery in the charger so it's almost always ready to go.Ease of Use: I adjusted to using this thing pretty quickly. I invested in a LowePro FastPack 250 and it works nicely as a diaper-bag/day bag/camera bag. Not the most attractive purse, but it works well. I'm much better at being ready for any photo situation now.Swivel Screen: No problems to report. I just leave it screen out all the time.SAME: Awesome camera all around. Truly, truly impressive. There might be higher tiers of quality out there, but for what I use in following the kids around, this captures amazing shots quickly. Love it.GOT (just a little) WORSE:Eye-Fi Annoyance: This is going to differ from person to person, but our Eye-Fi stuff has had some kinks to work out. The card we bought required several updates lately, then we had to change SmugMug account stuff, but the changed password meant Eye-Fi couldn't upload. Blah, blah, blah, I'm sure most of the problem is ME not getting the changes my hubby made. Still, Eye-Fi is usually automatic, but from time to time, it requires maintenance and understanding from all parties uploading stuff. Just be warned, it isn't so automagical as I hoped it would be.Getting used to the dSLR bulk: I'd be lying if I said the size of the camera wasn't occasionally an issue. There have been quite a few times I think, \"Oh, where's the camera? That's right, I left it at home/in the car because it's kind of a pain to pack around.\" On many occasions, the hubby's phone camera stood in for us (and it takes pretty decent pictures, so it's okay). But if I'm not being really deliberate about bringing the dSLR and using it, this camera becomes a very expensive toy that I never play with.Other than that ^ though, awesome camera. I'm truly loving it. On the whole, a Lotta camera for Low maintenance.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "gabol67", "ReviewID": "R3DDTGWU7DVRTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First time DSLR buyers might be a little scared at first when they start playing around with this camera.

On YouTube search \"2012 T3i Best DSLR\"Okay, now let's take a fresh look at the Canon EOS Rebel T3i (600D) DSLR and compare it to the 60D and T2i. In this review I'll also talk about some \"MUST HAVE\" accessories for this camera.The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR was release in March of 2011 and has quickly become one of the most popular DSLRs available.As if the Rebel line wasn't popular enough with budding photographers... The introduction of the T3i has captured the imagination of thousands of aspiring videographers... with it's ability to capture FULL HD video... bright, articulating 3 inch LCD screen (which comes in really handy when shooting video in the field), and the ability to select from a host of lenses... which is common to DSLRs in general.Professionals prefer DSLRs because they allow for an accurate preview of what they are shooting, at the moment they push the shutter button. DSLRs also have larger sensors than compact point-and-shoot digital cameras (which means a better quality and high-resolution image)...Full HD video and interchangeability of lenses are particularly attractive to wannbe videographers (especially in a sub-$1000 DSLR... like the T3i)... because NOW they can shoot amazing HD video footage for a fraction of the what it would have cost... just a few years ago... PLUS they end up with a great camera for still photography...The Canon T3i (600D) ships with the body, battery, battery charger, USB interface cable, AV cable, EOS solution disk (that contains the really handy EOS utility - I'll talk about this a bit more later...) and a suitable strap (although I quickly replaced mine). AND if you desire... a kit lens...The T3i is considered a compact DSLR at 5.2 inches wide, 3.9 inches high and 3.1 inches deep (not including a lens)... compared to the larger and more expensive 60D at 5.69 inches wide, 4.17 inches high and 3.09 inches deep.The T3i is very similar in size, weight and features to the less expensive T2i. The T3i feels solid and well made and is comfortable in the hand...But I do have smaller hands... So if your hands are larger you may want to look to the 60D OR grab the Zeikos battery, power grip... for your T3i...with an additional battery...This battery grip doubles the amount of shooting you can do between battery changes AND provides a much large grip surface.At the heart of the Canon T3i is an 18 megapixel CMOS digital sensor and the DIGIC 4 processor. This sensor and processor are also found in Canon's 60D and T2i.The camera has one SD card slot that can take a regular SD, SDHC or SDXC card... The T3i does not ship with a card. So plan on adding that to your your list.I highly recommend using nothing less than a class 10 SDHC card for with this camera, especially if you want to shoot HD video.  Even if you don't, you'll want a fast card when shooting continuous photos at 18 mega pixels. I personally like 32 GB cards because they are pretty cheap now and give you enough room to shoot photos all day. Plus 32 giga bites is large enough to hold almost 2 hours of HD video.The T3i has what Canon calls \"Live View Shooting\"...which provides a very accurate simulation of photos and video using the LCD screen... This is especially helpful when doing a video shoot without a separate field monitor.The 3 inch variable angle LCD monitor is bright enough for shooting in full sun... and can be flipped so that if lays flat against the camera back or can be positioned at various angles for high and low shooting.But remember... as with any camera-powered monitor, it will consume your batteries faster when you are using it. Brightness also effects battery consumption (which can be adjusted in the camera's setup menu). That being said, the flip and twist capabilities of this monitor make it a priceless asset for videographers and creative photographers.One of the major differences between the T3i and the 60D is it's continuous shooting speed of 3.7 frames per second verse the 60Ds 5.3 frames per second.For me, this was not an issue as I purchased my T3i primarily for shooting video. But if you like to shoot action, you may want to consider the 60D.The controls of the T3i are easy to access with the thumb and four finger.  And are pretty easy to master with little effort... I do suggest keeping the manual near as it will prove a valuable asset and will save frustration as your skills progress.One thing that really impressed about this camera was a real world example of how easy it is for a beginner to get professional results, with this camera... out of the box.One day my son... who has never used a DSLR camera before, went on a walk with my new T3i. When he came back I could tell from his face that he experienced something really special. His big smile made me very curious to see his photos.I was amazed at the stunning images this camera enabled him to capture... as he simply used the camera's scene \"intelligent auto mode\" and the dial-selectable \"creative zone modes.\"When you select a different dial mode, the camera shows a short and helpful description of that mode. This feature can accelerate your progress and help to quickly hone in on a mode that is best suited for the type of shooting you are doing.My son's experience helped me realize what a fantastic job Canon did skinning over this formidable professional-level camera... with a simple and easy to use point-and-shoot-like interface... that enables the novice (like my son) to achieve very satisfying results.I am convinced that results are one of the reasons that owners rate this camera MUCH higher (close to 5 out of 5 stars) than professional reviewers who usually rate this camera at less than 4 out of 5 starts... and tend to nit pick about technical details and specifications.I'm not saying that specs are not important... but what I am saying is that, at the end of the day... all that matters is that you have good quality photos and videos to show for your effort, regardless of your experience level.The T3i allows you to easily select and scroll between ISO 100 (for well-lit scenes) to ISO 6400 for lower lighting scenarios.Photo quality generally looks great up through ISO 800 and begins to show some small signs of degradation from ISO 1,600 on.The little scrolling wheel toward the front of the camera makes selection of a variety of functions... including ISO... really easy.The 9-pt autofocus systems is accurate and quick for photos... but does struggle in very low light situations.The T3i camera does have the ability to autofocus while you are shooting video... but often takes a few seconds to refocus focus...Plus the noise of the camera while focusing.... will likely be heard in your video. You will also find that the battery life will deplete rapidly when autofocusing a lot during a video.All this being said, the T3i's video autofocus is pretty useless. Fortunately there are plenty of other great reasons to like this camera...As with most cameras these days the T3i includes optical image stabilization that works well... with off-hand shooting.The T3is battery life is generally good... however, battery life is so subjective and is very dependent on how you shoot, the brightness of your LCD screen...  and things like... whether you are using autofocus or not...For shooting photos, I have found the battery life to be excellent allowing me to take 400 to 600 shots before needed a change.Shooting video will consume your batteries at a much more rapid rate if you are using the camera's LCD screen to monitor your video.So I would recommend that you pick up a few additional batteries. I have found a very inexpensive, after-market brand... that have proven to be just as reliable as the OEM battery that came with this camera. See my YouTube Review for more info on the accessories that I mention in this review...And if you want to seriously extend the battery life of this camera (which is especially useful on location during a video shoot)... you should pick up the Zeikos Battery Power Grip for this camera that I mentioned earlier.This is a high quality accessory that matches the camera in look and feel in every way and is less pricy than Canon's version.It easily and securely attaches to the camera and has a removable tray that allows you to power the camera with 2 batteries instead of one.This grip also comes with an additional tray that allows you to use 6 double A batteries to power the camera in a pinch. This is a great safety net for those involved in remote shooting... away from a power source.If you don't want to be limited by batteries, Canon offers a DC power unit. There is a battery sized coupler that you simply insert into the battery port to power the camera by plugging it into a wall outlet.For this accessory, I would only recommend the Canon brand.One nice feature for those who wear corrective lenses (like me)... is the quality dioptric adjustment knob for the camera view finder.This knob allows for plus and minus adjustments to ensure that you see things clearly through the view finder. Although this feature is common in many DSLRs... I was glad to find out that the T3i had it after the fact...The T3i has a built-in mono microphone that sounds pretty good for general video shooting and includes an effective wind filter that can be toggled on and off in the camera's setup.However, for serious video production I recommend that you use a quality external microphone to capture your audio. I use a Zoom H4N for a large range of purposes and really affordable Audio Technica lapel mics for shooting interviews and promotional videos. A Rode shotgun mic is another that you may want to consider.On the side of the T3i there is a 1/8 inch stereo mic input. With the appropriate adapters you can send audio from 2 different mics directly into the camera's left and right channels. The camera allows you for manual adjustment of the record levels which is very useful.There are several other camera ports which include... A remote control terminal. I picked up a very affordable timer remote that I use often for time lapse videos and low light situations.There's digital audio / video out terminal and a mini HDMI out terminal this is great for using an external field monitor or hooking your camera up to your HD TV.The SD card slot is on the other side and the battery compartment in easily accessible on the bottom of the camera.When it comes to video the T3i really shines. It offers full HD video at 1920 by 1080 pixels at 30, 25 and 24 frames per second... on the high end... and also offers 1280 x 720 pixels at 60 frames per second (which is nice for slow motion) as well as 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second.You can get exceptional results from this camera with a little attention to detail and by experimenting with the automatic and manual video settings... and by trying different lenses.For low lighting situations, you may want to consider picking up a Canon 50mm F1.8 lens. It's been dubbed \"plastic magic\" because it captures surprisingly good quality photos and video for a a lens with a street price that hovers around $100.The T3i also offers a 3x and 10x digital zoom that produces amazingly crisp video in movie mode.The camera also has a new video snapshot feature that takes short clips of video and stitches them together. It's a fun feature for walking around town and shooting short video clips or having some fun at a party.There's one VERY important aspect of shooting video with most DSLRs, and in our case, the T3i that you should be aware of.To protect the camera from internal heat generated when shooting video... the T3i will stop recording video when the file size of a single movie clip reaches 4GB.This means that if you are shooting in FULL HD that your maximum record time will be  around 10 to 14 minutes. This can be a bit annoying yet, it's easy enough to restart the video.... and if you only need to shoot clips shorter than 10 minutes you will probably never experience this issue.However this function can be problematic in situations where you need to shoot longer lengths of video, like at a conference, a sporting event, or a church sermon.One very helpful surprise that Cannon includes for free with this camera is the EOS utility software. With this software, the T3i, a reasonably modern computer (I use my MacBook Pro... 2010 vintage) and the included digital interface cable... you can extend the use of your laptop computer as a field monitor and command central for the camera.You can remotely control all important camera functions from within the very intuitive interface of this program.The EOS utility functions well for both photo and video shooting and provides a very nice simulation of what you will get...  This bonus has been particularly helpful to me for shooting video since it eliminated the need to purchase a $1,000 field monitor. Note though, that using the EOS utility will deplete your camera and laptop batteries faster than you would think. So I recommend plugging in your laptop and having a few extra batteries for your camera of getting the Canon DC coupler and power unit.The camera also has a very useful built-in flash that will automatically pop up when needed or can be accessed manually with the touch of a button.For more advanced photographers... the T3i supports the latest developments in wireless flash photography.SO who is this camera for?The T3i is best suited for those who want an easy to use, fast, reliable high-end prosumer DSLR that shoots incredible 18 mega pixel photos and FULL HD video... all in compact package for well under $1,000.If you plan on doing a lot of high speed photography you may want to consider the 60D for it's faster 5.3 frame per second continuous shooting... which is the only real major difference between the two. However this upgrade will cost you between $300 and $400.Also... if you want to save some money and don't really need the flip and turn LCD screen of the T3i... you many want to consider the T2i. This will save you around $100....I will caution you though...  if you ever think that you are going to want to shoot video, macro-zoom photographs or anything at high or low angles... you may be sorry that you didn't get the T3i with it's flippy screen.The T3i is also NOT for you if you want a compact, carry-in-your pocket camera to take with you everywhere... Even though the T3i is compact compared to many larger DSLRs... it's not small... So... if your main purpose is finding a camera to document life and have with you at all time... the T3i is probably not the camera for you.Also... If you want to eliminate your camcorder with the T3i, look somewhere else... that's not what the T3i is purposed for. It lacks seamless autofocus in video mode and is not as easy convenient to set up and use as many mini-camcorders.However, if you have a creative flair and want to shoot HD quality video productions, the T3i will help you get off to a great start.All this aside the Canon EOS Rebel T3i is an amazingly popular, all-around DSLR camera... which is evidenced by the fact that... at the time of this video review... the T3i is the #1 best selling DSLR on Amazon.The Canon T3i is an impressive value rivaling the Canon 60D in just about every way... and with it's full HD video, easy-to-use interface, exceptional 18 mega pixel image quality, large flip-and-turn LCD screen and a full set of professional functions... The T3i is a great place to jump into the wonderful world of DSLR photography and video... all for an astonishingly low street price of less than $800.VIEW MY FULL T3i VIDEO REVIEW with Test Video, Sample Photos and Time Lapse Video on YouTube by Searching \"2012 T3i Best DSLR\"Enjoy!", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "a high end for DSLR beginners!", "Author": "Arsene Lupin \"gentleman cambrioleur\"", "ReviewID": "RMA616S7HD9D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was so surprised how light is the T3i, (in comparison to 7D /50D or 60D) with its 18.0 mega pixel the  CMOS sensor captures superb image quality with low noise and natural colorThe EOS T3i, positioned between the EOS T2i and EOS 60D, features scene intelligent auto, 3-inch vari-angle clear view LCD and a selection of five creative filters including the new fish eye effect (which is awesome!!)honestly, once you get this camera, no need for Photoshop.I initially purchased the 7DCanon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-inch LCD (Body Only), but then I returned it due to the more complicated usage, and the post-photo processing/ editing necessary for making pictures look better.T3i comes with an instructional guide built in, like the Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens.

I shoot my toddler in continuous mode, and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps it's supposed to.  It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture.  The T3i, however, adds frequent and unpredictable delays when \"busy\" flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.I used the same exact settings on both cameras (large Jpeg, P-mode, Quick AF).  Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i, this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots.

Having only ever used a Canon PowerShot SD610 and cell phone cameras before, this was a huge leap for me.I use the camera primarily to take pictures of the kids and flowers/gardens.I have read through the manual and found it a great asset (I have written techmanuals and read a lot of manuals, and find this one to be very easy to use).  With its use I have tried every mode on the dial and used the Q - Quick Control to try the different functions.  With the exception of the \"M\" -Manual Exposure, I have taken great pictures (OK - Excellent/Awesome by my standards, the people on the photo blogs may disagree with my assessment of my photos:)).The video capability is truly amazing, but does require a fast card (class 6 and up) I have a Class 10 and noted some lag when my son was running around in a low light living room.  The Grandparents will be able to watch HD movies on their big screen.The weight is a bit hefty compared to the Point and Shoot but feels right in your hands.  I have larger hands and the grips feel really nice even when holding the camera for extended time.Battery life appears to be good, I have yet to have the battery fail on me when I need it, but I have only had the camera a short time.  Time will be the judge of this.  I did by a second battery (Canon clone, not OEM).File size requires a SD card of decent size (Large .jpg High Quality = 6.4MB, RAW = 24.5MB) the camera is compatible with SDHC and SDXC cards, I have a 16 gig SDHC Class 10 (A-Data 16 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card 16GSDHC10 (Blue)).  Not sure what the SDXC brings to the table but if I pick one up I'll update this review.Live Mode (like a standard point and shoot - LCD screen shows image to be captured) is great for videos and can help when composing shoots from various angles (taking pictures of the dog near floor - without kneeling).  There is even a Live Mode with facial recognition and tracking, chases my sons face all over and gives me the correct focus.  The Live Mode was the only mode I figured I would be able to use, but I find the standard viewfinder eyepiece to be very easy to use and has all of the information you need.I plan to have this camera for years to come and hope to someday master all of the settings (high expectations).  I feel this camera is the perfect match for my current ability (A+ Fully Automatic Shooting allows me to take excellent pictures while using the camera like a Point and Shoot) and my desire to become the photographic artist I hope to be).Anyone thinking about make the change from Point and Shoot to dSLR should really consider this camera.  May I also suggest a camera bag, and cleaning kit.I have posted a few of my images on in the photo gallery here on Amazon.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product for entry-level photographers and those who want to shoot pictures/video!", "Author": "Dennis A. Amith (kndy)", "ReviewID": "RVY3QR2FZA6EH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I typically write, while we have professional photographers who do a lot of our legwork at events.  But recently, at an engagement party, I was using my trustworthy Canon Powershot and when it came to photos, for every one photo I took, my friend with his T2i was take 10 or more.  And even indoors, his pictures looked great!Because I travel and cover so many events and there are times where our photographers are busy covering things, I figured...It would be great to have a DSLR.  I was at E3 and using my point-and-shoot, I knew right then and there, it was time to get a DSLR. I've been wanting to get one but frankly, the thought of me having to invest in the camera and several lenses and knowing they are not cheap...  I hesitated.But no longer.  It was time to get a DSLR!I have to admit....I was struggling between a Nikon 5100 or a Canon T3i (EOS 600) or even considering going a little higher-end.But I've read from professionals who say, \"It's the glass, not the body\" and even our photographers, some of them are still using DSLR's made in the early 2000's and are quite content with the body, just focusing on the lens.For me, I wanted the best of both worlds of having something to shoot photos and video.  While I was close to getting the Nikon, the video review on digitalrev was enough to convince me to go for the T3i (EOS 600) and for its price range, I was comfortable with that.  Maybe in the future I can get something high-end but for now, I need something entry-level and with the T2i having dropped in price and selling out online and at stores, I noticed the T3i can be found and sure enough, while there are a few more technical things that it has compared to the T2i, for me, the swivel lens was something that I liked.  Especially for shots that require taking photos from weird levels and angles.  So, that was a plus for me!Upon opening the box, I realized that the T3i felt good but the higher-end cameras were more to my liking and are much more tougher.  But I figured, you get what you pay for and with the T3i, I just need to make sure I take care of it.WHAT YOU GET:I bought the version with an EF-S 18-55 IS II, so I got the lens with the two caps, inside are also the USB cord to transfer images and the Canon EOS Digital strap.  Instruction booklets, warranty registration and more.SO FAR, SO GOOD:Since owning the T3i, I have put this camera through hardcore use in a short amount of time.  Different events, different weather and have purchased quite a few things for this camera.If there is only one thing that I WISHED this camera did have was an easier menu to change things.  Aperature or Shutterspeed.  Granted, higher end models may have a display right at the top but looking at the LCD, definitely read the manual and experiment how to change various settings and experiment how you can change on the fly.And here are my thoughts that will definitely be different recommendations from others but it works for me:*  Get a good prime lens - 50mm 1.8 (preferably a 1.4) Canon lens.  I have the former which works great for portrait shots but I know already that the 1.4 works much better...it's also several hundred dollars more.*  Third party - I went third party for batteries, grip, hoods and they work perfectly.  I know there are diehards who purchase official Canon products but they are expensive and if you want to save money, look toward third party products.*  Read the Manual - I know there are people (like myself) who are impatient of reading manuals but in this case, read the manuals, especially those Canon-based brochures of lenses they recommend.*  Lenses - L lenses are great if you can afford them but if you can get yourself some Canon glass with image stabilization, this works great for entry-level photographers!  But if you are in it for the video, you want to get better glass!*  Research and Flickr! - I did a lot of research before buying this camera and for the most part, camera sites have all been positive. But definitely do your research.  I call my photographer friends and staff with questions but seriously, I learned that they are used to their high-end cameras and used to their lenses that they can give you some advice but it's best to experiment on your own but also go on Flickr and study other photographers, look at their exif data and get an idea of what lens they shot, what aperture, what shutter speed, etc.  And try to experiment with those settings.  Granted, lighting and setting is different but it's good to research and see what others are doing and what they were able to capture and knowing what lens they use.*  Last - Shoot Raw and consider purchasing a 10-speed, 16-32GB card.  Shooting at RAW gives you more options when using software like PhotoShop or Lightroom but you definitely want to shoot at RAW.  Nothing wrong with shooting via JPG, if you can manually fix those images on your own but I regret going to one event and shooting in JPG...I wished I shot RAW.  Now I do most of the time.  I say most of the time because I am in the process of purchasing a 32GB card (10-speed) and I have shot RAW 90% and 10% of the space, shot in JPG.JUDGMENT CALL:The T3i definitely delivers in picture quality and video.  Granted, if you have another $1,500+ to spend and money is no object...then go for the higher end Canon DSLR's.  But if you want to spend under a $1,000 but want very good quality for photos and video...the T3i is great!  There is not a humongous jump in features vs. its T2i brother and for some, the T2i may be enough, in fact, if you are not planning to shoot video, some people may want just the XSi which I still see people using and have taken great pictures with it.But for me, the extra features that I saw with this camera, I have seen the potential that I can utilize in different settings of event coverage that I go to.  If there is one thing that I wish I had...better lenses.  The kit lens is a good entry level but at 18-55, there are times when I needed to switch to the EF75-33 (f4-5.6 III) and I see that my photographer had the convenience of having an 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens and saw how it would make my life easier to have such a lens.In fact, I really like the IS (image stabilization lens) and now looking towards those lenses for my T3i.  The kit lens is good but you will definitely want a good zoom!  And also, I felt that using the cheap Canon 50mm 1.8 gave me more vibrant photos and better bokeh than the 18-55mm that came with the kit.As for video, the mic on the T3i is not the best, so you may want to consider purchasing a mic (one person I know uses a boom mic, another uses a mic that attaches on top T3i).  Taking video is very good but once again, if you are going for the T3i...plan to invest in larger GB cards...8GB is very good but I'm learning that I need more than that!  You may as well if you do cover events or take a lot of photos.While the menu interface could have been better, part of the convenience that Canon does give to those who spend more money...so, for under $1,000...the T3i is still a great deal for the quality it gives.I love this camera and I'm still learning as I go but so far so good! I still have yet to buy a Speedlite Flash (I do have an older Canon Speedlite from the late '70s (which I have used on a Canon A-1 SLR) that does work with the T3i but rather purchase something more modern.  And a few other things but for now, I'm just enjoying the pictures I take (and not enjoying the pictures I take, which is part of the learning process) but I'm quite content and happy that I bought this camera.If anything happens 6 months or a year down the line, I will definitely update this review.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera", "Author": "Jerry Peery", "ReviewID": "R5JWMLFX3JG8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been a professional journalist and a horse show photographer in the past, I wanted a camera that was user-friendly yet capable of providing me with truly excellent, high-resolution images.

I have other EOS and Canon cameras. Digital and film.Wanted to try this new model as it had the flip out back which I wanted.The first day it worked great. Took some great photos.Next day, I went a few miles from home and took what i thought would be a great series of shots.  Never used the swing back as it was a very bright sunny day.  Just used the view finder.  It took photos...BUT...when I got home I flipped out the swing back to look at some of them real quick and discovered that there was an error code showing... Error 01  Failure of lense to communicate with camera.  Ok, fine...went to look at the photos I took and discovered I had no photos.  apparently the error happened immediately on me turning the camera on at the spot i took the photos.  I was not happy because you do not get an error code through the viewfinder if there is a problem..least not one that I saw.  Triedf to resolve the error code..as explained by support, and though nothing worked at the time, I continued trying different things and finally the error code disappeared and camera working. Ok, fine...next day...went to take some more photos..checked the screen.and the error code was back.  This time nothing i did helped.Contacted Canon support and was told to return the camera or send it to one of their repair centers. I called because on the Canon website when i clicked on their support icon for this model with lense since they dont have a listing for body only, I would get a screen saying that they were not repairing this model. Kind of strange.So am returning it to Amazon for replacement rather than sending it to the Canon repair center as I didnt want to wait possibly weeks. Amazon is great about it especially since I had it only a few days.  They are shipping a new one immediately which is fantastic and gave me a return label for return shipping for the defective camera.Not sure just what is wrong with this first one as I have never had a problem with any of my Canon cameras other than normal wear and tear over time.  So I was very surprised. But I guess with all the ones I have bought over the years, there was always the chance to get one with problems. This time, I did.  I still like the camera and I will always use Canon's.  Just diappointed that I am now having to wait a couple of days to get the new one before I get out taking photos with it.  I would still recommend it, buy which and gave 4 stars..but cant give 5 because of being disppointed at getting a defective one.I will update this review after I get the new one and see how it does.///////////////// OK, I RECIEVED THE NEW CAMERA. //////////////////////////////////////And have been using, also purchased the battery grip for it and extra batteries.First, the new one is great.  No problems and I dont have the error with it and my EF lenses. Though the weather hasnt permitted much outdoor photography for me, I was able to attend the photoshoot that I had had scheduled and because of Amazons wonderful service, I was able to use my new camera.  And it performed as I had nticipated.  It is as good or better than any of my other canon cameras. I am going to upload some photos shortly taken with this new camera.  Its a good camera.  Fast, sharp and easy to use. The controls take a little getting used to as placement is some different from my older canons. But once I was familiar with them it didnt take long to change settings or to switch modes or whatever I wanted to do.//////////////////Another Update //////////////////////////////////Been using it even more.  And the error code 1 has begun appearing again.  And after alot of discussions with Canon support, it seems that this new camera is not going to be compatible with so-called 3rd party lenses.  Right folks, if you have Sigma or Tamron lenses or otherss for the EOS system, then there is a good chance they might not work on this new camera.  Just wondering if this is planned?  Now in order to use this camera, I have to buy new lenses.  I have Sigma lenses and only one canon lense.  My sigma lenses arent cheap ones either.  So now, only canon lenses will work.  Not what I liked to hear.  Makes we wonder why.  Of course, its obvious when you consider the cost of 3rd party lenses compared to buying a canon brand lense.  3rd party leanses are alot cheaper in cost and at little difference in quality.More I find out, the more I am disappointed in this camera. I still like it, but am NOT happy at having to buy lenses just to be able to use it now. Not the camera, but Canon. Sigma is being great and as a long time customer is allowing me to trade my old lenses for new ones.  Still going to be out more money, but now where near as much as I would have//////////////////////////////// NEW UPDATE //////////////////////////////////Have gotten my new Sigma lens. Used it extensively testing it the last few days. It works perfectly.  No problems and am really happy with the images.  Very bright and color saturation is good.  Photos look great. I print mine on a Kodak printer which I am very happy with. My small prints anyway.  I have larger ones done by a specialty shop.Regardless, the problems seem to stem from the camera and older 3rd party lenses being incompatible in some way.  New technology...??  Very possible.  And likely designed in by canon.  They will fix any canon lenses to work with the newer cameras.  So what the change was...who knows.  I do know that Sigma does stand behind their lenses.  They have a program for long time customers, so if you experience problems, like I did, get in touch with them.  You will not be disapponted. Just dont expect something for nothing.  I didnt...and I love my new lense.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "First time DSLR owner", "Author": "MacMaven234", "ReviewID": "R8MFL8HYO9FW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not worthy to be a serious reviewer of this product, as I'm just learning what all the photo jargon means.

I'm happy with my choice so far, having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art, using the Canon 60mm macro lens.  For that use, the camera and lens seem to work very well.  I find the ergonomic arrangement of controls on the camera to very very intuitive and pleasant to use.  The camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip.  The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions (ie, overhead, or low to the ground) are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.  The camera comes with a comfortable, good quality neck strap and is quite light and small compared to other SLRs. Battery life seems to be very good - longer than I expected.  The included corded battery charger will appeal to some, but not to those who prefer the travel type charger with a swing-out plug.

I will instead focus on the camera itself (the hardware/software) instead of the picture quality, which is SUPERB.PROS:The sheer amount of features allowed is nice.  As my first DSLR, I can only judge this camera against point and shoots.Everything can be tweaked and tuned as expected in a DSLR, but it also has a \"auto\" mode, which is nice when you just want to take a quick shot and not have to worry about ISO settings, etc, etc.The shutter itself feels much better than a point and shoot, and the focus time, and the downtime between shots is also WAY lower than the run of the mill point and shoot.A feature I haven't seen as flexible in point in shoot is the timer shots.  You can set it to take anywhere from 1-10 pictures with 1 timer.  This is great for big family photos where you prop the camera up on a tripod and just want to do 10 photos in a row - and hopefully everyone will have their eyes open in one of those 10 photos (especially hard with little kids).CONS:The software/hardware feels sort of undated.  Canon has stuck with this same layout for a long time for continuity, but new point and shoots have a much more streamlined interface.  For example, the wheel on the top (where you switch between modes), does not allow for 360 degree rotation, only like 300 degrees rotation.  This means, for example, if you were in Video Capture mode and wanted to go to Macro Mode, you have to spin the wheel 300 degrees instead of just 60 degrees.The software is one that takes getting used to.  They use a \"tab\" system to tell you which settings you are messing with in the Menu.  The tab system may be familiar to long time Canon users, but the way the tabs are labeled sometimes make it confusing.  Instead of using words, they use symbols, which I feel do not match well.  For example, there are \"tabs\" with a Wrench icon.  Unless I memorize which setting is where, there is a hard time remember exactly what settings are changed in the \"wrench\" tab.The battery must be charged separately from the device.  I don't know if this is a standard for DSLR, but I liked how I could just plug in my camera itself and charge it on point and shoots.Overall:There is no arguing the picture quality, it is basically the same as the T2i, and professional reviews all across the internet rate this as the top entry-level DSLR.  It has settings for a beginner like me, and it has settings for advanced users as well.For those wondering between T2i and T3i, the main difference is a spin-out LCD screen, and digital zoom during video.  These differences are small, and I know I was confused when I first researched this DSLR.  The T2i and T3i are much more similar than the T3 vs T3i.T2i or T3i - Get either, T3/T2 are a lower-end model, they are made for two different budget targets.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Jesse Jack Riddle Jansen", "ReviewID": "R24EO2Y8YZROJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at many items before pulling the trigger on the Canon T3i. I went to Best buy and tested out the Canon T2i, the Nikon D5100, the Canon 60D, and the Nikon D7000. After testing out all the products I came to the decision that the only cameras I liked that felt good in my hand were the Canon T2i, Nikon D5100 and the Can T3i. I went for the T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only, which is not a huge deal. The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at $789.99 with the lens kit.I took the camera out to the beach and tested it and was amazed by the Canon T3i quality. I literally took a picture of a surfer 75 Yards away with the kit lens, and was able to zoom in, in Photoshop and crop an up close beautiful detailed picture of the surfer. The quality is amazing I am upgrading from a Canon XSI and love it. I also took a picture of a cherry tree that was about 30 yards away, and then opened it up in Photoshop, zoomed in, and could see cherries that I could not even see with my eyes from the spot where I took the picture.

You just have to chose which one you want..I'll tell you what is , if it's useful just click my review as helpful..Oh go on then, I'll tell you anyway :)Up until this camera came along I used an hd camcorder for my video and a dslr for my bird photography. This camera along with the 70-300mm lens means \"one camera does all\". This is because the t3i has a 3x zoom with no loss in quality and really without pixel peeping that is pretty much true.In a nutshell the newer t4i with the newer sensor and the \"autofocus\" loses this feature...mmm If you are are even contemplating filming on safari, or birds in you're bag yard getting a 900mm lens with your 300mm lens is just too useful to lose.The video quality is great but you need to work at it. Its certainly not as easy to use as a dedicated camcorder but the results can be better.So if you're thinking of getting the t3i, reading the reviews, comparing it to the 6t4i and countless others you're probably pulling your hair out at all the pros and cons? Am I close. I'm a photographer and have used this, the t4i and its sony equivalent.But herein lies the real point of this camera and the t4i and the others. You know its the person behind the camera that takes the pictures but do you really know it? This and the t4i take pictures so good (if you have the skill) you could blow it up the size of front door but are you going to want to. The thing no sellers want to tell you is that for years, maybe 5 , all of the big names have been making great dslr. Since the nikon d40 perhaps. But you really want to know, if you bought this, would you be happy or buying a pup?. Be reassured that neither canon, nikon or sony make chocolate teapots. They know how to make a great camera and this is one.So the photos will be great and its a great camera, you've read other reviews so I won't duplicate what you have already read but one thing you may not have read is about the video. All the makers have got dslr right. No pups in sight, but video is a relatively new feature and Sony have tbh been leading the way. This camera sets to rectify that.It doesn't have autofocus but a lot of places on the net, say it's not needed, you should be using manual focus. That's nonsense. Manual focus is ok at times but can be a pain. Filming your dog on the beach for example..You could go for the autofocus on the t4i is actually pretty good. Not as good as a camcorder but pretty good. The slowest part is for it to get going. But when it's locked on its sound. Well worth having. So thats sorted right..err no, not really. This is the t4i 's killer feature. Trouble is, they left out the killer feature from this t3i. The 3x zoom with \"no loss in quality\". So here is the choice if you are buying this for video.if you want you're 300mm zoom to be able to zoom to 900mm for filming sport or wildlife. It's the t3i for youIf you love the idea of autofocus (or hate the idea of doing it the old fashioned way) its the t4i for you.In my opinion if you're considering the other makes like Sony, it comes down to who makes the the lens you are likely to want. I know I have focused (terrible pun intended)  about video but hey, there has been thousands of photo reviews already about iso , shutter speed etc etc. Nothing for me to add there!One more thing I forgot to mention (and yes it is regarding the video) is that to get great video you need to use the right settings in the menu.Unfortunately these are counter intuitive and if you don't use them you may be under whelmed.

Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice. But then I remember the heft and bulk of that camera and all the times I've left my SLR at home for those very reasons, and I know the T3i was the right decision.

This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.

Just last night, I took some outstanding low-light shots that were exciting for a newbie like me, and would not have been do-able with a standard point-and-shoot.I really like the swivel on the live view when doing video clips, which was another reason I chose this camera over competitive models.

I am a videographer and this thing is amazing with video (even better with fast lenses of course).  Being that I shoot video, the fold out screen has been very useful in seeing what I am shooting whether the camera is high or low, for example, I am able to have the camera mounted on a monopod and lift it up over the dance floor at a wedding... Without the adjustable screen, many of my shots would be useless. Much of the research I did, didn't make a big deal of this, but I definitely think it worth the difference in price, if not more.  If you just shoot photos, it may not be as necessary, but I'm sure it will still help more than you expect.If you're a professional photographer, you may want to skip the rest of this review.  If you're new to DSLRs, DON'T GET THE KIT!!! I know its very tempting because as soon as your new toy comes in, you want to play with it. To do so you obviously need a lens.  Well to say the least, I wish I listened to everyone and put the money into better lenses than these.  If you haven't looked into lenses yet, be prepared for sticker shock, because many of them cost much more than the camera itself.  I know it's a bit overwhelming at first, but your pictures and video will be much better AND your lenses will retain their value whereas your camera body will not.  To be honest, if you are just getting into photography(and no video), I would say save some money on the body and buy a used canon xsi and put the rest into a lens or two.  It's sad to say but they will outlive your camera body (as long as you care for them) and if for some reason you decide you want to stop shooting, they can easily be sold for close to what you bought them for.The canon 50mm 1.8f is an amazing value for about $100-$120 (see the product link at the bottom) which I would strongly recommend over the kit lens. If you're planning on doing professional photography in the future, you may want to get the 1.4f, $300 - $400, if you have the money because it's a faster lens with better construction, and the focus ring is much nicer. It is important to note that the 50mm lens is a prime lens (meaning no zoom) so you would have to walk closer or further from the subject to manually zoom.If you want a zoom lens, I would recommend a couple things... Research \"Aperture\" and understand what the \"f\" number is when purchasing a lens(a constant aperture throughout the range is preferable, yet more costly).  Also I would recommend doing some research on Tamron and sigma brand lenses.  Although canon lenses are definitely the best, the price tag definitely reflects it.  I have decided to go with sigma lenses myself, but that's not really the point of this review so I won't go any further than to say if you have lens questions, feel free to use the comment section of this review and I can share everything that I've learned researching them.  I am by no means an expert but I will do my best to assist.Sorry for that rant, yet I see these reviews as a way of helping others learn from my mistakes and benefiting from my research.

Choosing a camera that works for you, while wondering what to spend is a difficult task. I'm still using the 2nd edition of the Rebel, a 6.6 Megapixel camera without video and it's become obvious that I want more resolution (more megapixels) and more features. The T3i, though now two versions below the current T5i, is a strong contender.What you give up: If you choose \"entry level\" you are giving up some new features you may or may not want; for example, the mid-level 70D Canon has wifi. While this may seem frivolous, during a recent trip to a remote area, I personally would have loved wifi on my camera as I was trying not to have to bring every electronic device under the sun with me, and opted only for a Kindle -- no laptop. This was a good choice, as hotels had wifi and the Kindle is decent enough as a tablet-substitute, but I could not upload and share photos with locals who wanted a shot I took of a rare bird. Wifi would have given instant access to online photo editing, or sharing.Mid level also means a better processor (speed, better interpretation of images, less noise), a more advance video system, better viewfinder and waterproofing. If any of these features are sounding desirable, you should consider a mid level such as a 70D and skip the Rebel.If cost is paramount, however, the Rebel T3i has a lot to offer. For one thing, it is easy to use. The controls are logically laid out, and though you have plenty of choices of mode (manual, shutter or aperture preferred, for example) the automatic mode is fast and easy and great for grabbing quick shots in tough situations. I find I can grab quick shots with no fumbling, and that is something that is important if you are shooting sports or nature, for example.The Rebel T3i came out early 2011. It still is one of  Canon's most popular DSLR camera, followed by the Rebel T4i. It is preferred even over the 60D (the midlevel predecessor to the 70D, which added wifi.) The T4i and T5i are practically the same, but add a newer processor, faster shutter speed and more noise reduction; if you notice noise and want 5 frames per second, and a touch screen, you'll want the T4i or T5i. It is also better in low light situations, again, what do you like to shoot? If you do low light, if you are doing multi-shot, sports photography, you may want the newer version Rebel and skip the T3i.The T3i has 18-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with image quality that is not inferior to the more expensive 60D. The 63-zone dual-layer exposure metering system is entirely adequate for most situations.You can buy it with the usual 18-55mm EF lens, but this is a lens that I don't prefer--it's a good point-and-shoot choice, with wide-angle to mid telephoto focal length, but a more versatile choice is something like a 28-to-105mm which gets you from wide angle to portrait-telephoto without lens changes. Adding a 70-300 for nature shots would equip you very well with minimal need for lens changes. (It all depends on what you shoot--I like action and nature shots while walking in areas that are not amenable to fiddling with camera equipment, so I try not to have lens changes. If you shoot on a tripod, at sporting events in stands, in areas where you have leisure to adjust your equipment, you can choose lenses to suit your application, ie wide angle for real-estate photography or interiors, telephoto on a tripod in a bird blind.)The rear of the camera has a fully articulating 3-inch LCD with a 3:2 aspect ratio. This is a bright, easy to use screen. The viewfinder is what you use for still shots, but if you plan to do videos, the fold-out screen is almost essential.  You can do HD videos with relative ease, choosing different aspect ratios.Bottom line: If you are moving from \"point and shoot\" fixed lens cameras to a DSLR, and do not want to spend a lot of cash, or if you prefer to spend on the lens and budget for the camera body, the T3i is a stellar choice. If you need some weatherproofing or wifi or more advanced processing and you have moved past your original entry-level DLSR, you might consider whether it is worth spending almost 3X more to get the features of the 70D. If you are shooting low light and want the newer shutter speed and processor, a budget choice may be the newer T4i or T5i, which is a few hundred more but not as much as the 70D.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, bad, and ugly", "Author": "Greggrey Cudworth \"cuddysark\"", "ReviewID": "R1F1RHNLRGUWGD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The 3ti is a great camera and takes great pictures.

You would think that a camera costing almost 3 times as much would have at least as many, if not more, capabilities as one costing almost 3 times less.After buying the 3ti I found out that the Nikon 5100 has these features.  Go figure that.Also you must be careful about the deals being offered.The 75-300mm lens that comes as a special kit does not have the shake resistant capability. you have to read the fine print to know this. It also helps if you are not a novice, like I am.  Shame on me for not spending months researching. An honest retailer would have explained this in the item description. I don't know if Amazon is at fault or the retailer; but either way a little heads up would have been nice.

This is my first DSLR (I upgraded from the Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS, which was a point-and-shoot), I got it a few days ago, and I have had it with me 24/7 unless the battery was charging.This video mainly talks about the buttons and what they do, but I'll give some pros and cons of the Canon Rebel T3i, and the 18-55mm lens I purchased with it.PROS:Flip screen (allows you to take pictures, and see them as you take them, from just about every angle!)Lots of modes on the mode dial, including Scene Intelligent Auto (I've mainly used the manual modes)IS lens (Image Stabilizer)Live viewMicrophone jackEverything!  (This is my first DSLR and I can't really compare it to others, but I'm satisfied and love it!)CONS:Big and bulky, as are all DSLRsBuilt in flash isn't amazing (I recommend getting an external flash, although I don't have one)Microphone isn't amazing (unless you're doing an interview or need a great microphone, just stick with the internal one)RECOMMENDED ITEMS TO BUY WITH CAMERA OR AFTER PURCHASE:Tripod (big and small)Extra battery (It has a long life, and will last for about a day on a full charge.  But I highly recommend getting another one)Macro reverse ring (allows you to reverse your lens and mount it on your camera for close-up macro shots)Relatively large card (I use SD cards and have a 16 GB card.  I will be buying a new one soon because shooting video takes up a lot of space)Camera bag (as you start to get into photography, or just use your camera more, you'll eventually end up with a lot of accessories for your camera.  This is a good way to carry those around)Note: sorry for the poor quality of the video, the maximum amount of file size I can upload is 100MB.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i with 18-135mm zoom lens", "Author": "Megagauss", "ReviewID": "RDCP5XHPW6AHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital SLR camera.

Will edit this if this does not turn out to be true. My switch was mostly due to pathetic nikon warranty service.The IS works really well and I think better than nikon's which I had tried for a week with a borrowed D5000.Digital 3x zoom in video mode.The 430EX II external flash can be supported by the camera wirelessly. On nikon's this is only true for the more expensive SB800s flashes.Cons:Auto focus in \"live view\" mode (seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder) is extremely slow. Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.No mode in canon to set Av mode and set min shutter speed while letting the camera pick the ISO. Standard in Nikons. Canon seems to pick the shutter speed based on the zoom (focal length selected).White balance in Full auto mode sometimes messes up. Some pictures came out blue-ish.No good priced \"normal\" 50mm/35mm lens available. There is only one 50mm el-cheapo which apparently looks extremely cheap but I will buy it anyway.I upgraded from nikon D50 to this. So of course the pictures are much much better.In hindsight, The nikon D5100 has a better (larger DX sensor vs canon APS sized sensor) sensor. So less noise on the Nikon.Also, I think that video modes in SLR cameras are fairly useless unless you are good with manual focussing and use the tripod. BTW, the lens IS does work in video mode.I will edit this review as I play with this camera more. The 18-135 lens is nice but a bit large.

The quality is superb and low-lighting is a breeze (as soon as you get used to working the correct settings).The main reason I chose the T3i was for the 1080p video is offers. The video quality is great, but there are a few things to be aware of.1) You'll want to get a memory card rated at a 10 for speed, and make sure it's a good-quality brand. If you scrimp on the card you'll forever be hitting yourself when the video recording repeatedly stops for no apparent reason. I have been through three cards that don't cut it (three different brands). Make sure you shell out the money for a quality card or you won't be able to record the data fast enough for 1080p (particularly in bright lighting or when you have a light source in the background--like a TV or lamp).2) The camera does not auto-focus while recording video which can be really annoying. If you do any panning or zooming you will find yourself constantly toggling the manual focus on your lenses. Most DSLRs are the same, but I made an unwise assumption that this one would be different since they seemed to solve many of the conventional video problems DSLRs have.3) If you use an external video monitor while shooting video, plan on 480i resolution. The second you push the record button on the camera, the 1080p output signal changes to 480i (DVD quality video) instead of 1080p (High Def). This is not a problem at all if you don't use an external monitor, but is really annoying if you do.4) Sound quality from the built-in mic is not good. I use external mics, so this is not an issue for me, but if you depend on the built-in mic for your audio you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Still, it does okay for home video in a pinch, but for professional-quality video you'll want to purchase an external mic.All-in-all, this is a fantastic camera for still photos and a great camera for video quality/clarity. It is a little weak on the video recording features, but...what can we expect from a DSLR, right?I would definitely recommend this camera for anyone in the market for a camera in this price range. If I had a little extra to spend for a DSLR I would recommend a Canon 7D. If I were to purchase solely for video I would recommend a Canon HF G10. Yeah, I'm a Canon fan.

My other option was the 5D Mark II, but it would have been too hi-tech for me (plus it does not come with a built-in flash), and not to mention $1200.00 more expensive.The Canon T3i is a perfect START for anyone who is not already familar with the DSLR cameras.The shutter sounds will need some getting used to, and auto-focus as well.I carry my camera everywhere I go, the pictures are fantasic.

This body is rock solid and worthy of purchase for ANY and ALL people entering or needing an advanced DSLR camera. I purchased the body only - I have several lenses from my previous Canons which are NOT currently 'IS' lenses. I've been shooting people, places and other things for more than 45 years and LOVE this camera. It's extremely mobile. I can just flip open my tripod lock and GO! My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE (as I've found so far). As soon as you move up to manual for full control, you lose the grid (I use the 3x3), which helps me set my composition. Yes, I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder, but WHY when one is readily available.With my additions on the camera already, video/image reviews will be plentiful. As I learn new tricks and shortcuts, I'll inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasn't necessary, yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. I'll be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months, as well as trying out the 'IS' lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced (and WAY higher priced), big brothers to this camera. Now, the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW! The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out, are bored with the out of date \"point-n-shoot,\" want to upgrade your digital cams, or you want to move from film to digital, the T3i will not disappoint. It's an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro, this camera really shines. Oh, and the video.....It's 1080p HD, nothing more needs to be said.

I upgraded from the t1i and what a great upgrade it was.The size is great, it's relatively light and fits in my hands perfectly.The kit lens (18-55mm) is also better than to be expected. Takes pretty sharp pictures and for the price, can't get any better!The articulated swivel screen is probably my favorite part of this camera. I can close it when not using the camera and not worry about the screen getting scratched, and it really helps for getting those low shots where I normally would had to lay completely flat on my stomach. The screen itself looks beautiful, there are so many pixels so you can get a real good idea if you were in focus or not.Recently, I was considering getting a Canon G12 because I thought I would use it more, but I decided against it. Either way I have to lug a camera around. The G12 may be significantly smaller, but I won't just throw it in my purse without a case, so I might as well have my t3i with me and use my iPhone if I don't have it.Side note: for those looking to get a good CHEAP portrait lens, look at Canon's 50mm Prime f/1.8 lens. It's only about $125 and will allow you to get those great portraits that the kit lens won't.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top of the pack, picked T3i over 60D, a55, D5100 and love it", "Author": "Christopher Burian", "ReviewID": "RO7J4VGGD88BR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We compared the T3i head to head against the Nikon D5100.  In full auto mode, the T3i beats the Nikon.  They are probably identical in the hands of a pro using manual settings, but in auto the D5100 has lousy white balance and notable motion blur.Then we compared the T3i head to head against the D5100, the Sony Alpha 55, and the Canon 60D.  Found the 60D to be too heavy, and that the 18-135mm lens is also too heavy and cumbersome.  I really liked the fixed mirror of the Sony and continuous phase autofocus in live view and movie mode.  But the snapshots of the T3i were slightly better.  With the shortcomings of the a55, it is probably a tier lower and thus overpriced.  I think we'd have bought the a77 over the T3i if both were $700 for the body and 18-55mm kit.The T3i excels under low light, the whole point of moving up from a point and shoot.  It was hard to not go with a mirrorless or fixed mirror system, but the T3i had the best pictures, simple as that.  After taking about 600 pictures in the last few days, had to learn a little about the semi-auto features.  Very useful are setting white balance to scene instead of using auto or a preset, and using portrait mode for indoor shots and putting the flash up or down as desired.  Also find shutter priority mode helpful to get shots without motion blur, and also like locking max auto ISO to 1600 or 800 for lower noise.The bottom line is that we get extremely natural looking photos taken indoors at night without flash.  I took pictures in dim tungsten lighting that look like they were taken in the afternoon with indirect sunlight coming in the windows.  Amazing--why we bought the camera and why it gets 5 stars.Also bought the Tamron 18-200mm zoom lens and the Rode Videomic Pro as accessories--both of those earn 5 stars, too.We purchased the T3i and the Tamron lens online from B&H; who has a no-hassle return policy.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING!", "Author": "LTA", "ReviewID": "R1GPEB1NV9CW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just bought this camera a little over a week ago.

This is everything I could have dreamed for! Literally!The T3i functions like a dream and is easy to use. It also tasks beautiful pictures and has allowed me to expand my photography horizons from point-and-shoot and iPhone/iPad to something more flexible.Everything functions as expected and I have not encountered any hardware or software problems, even though I use it pretty much every day. The lens swaps out easily for another lens if you want and it is very easy to clean and care for. The LCD screen is very helpful. It fits perfectly with a standard non-Canon tripod I had from my point-and-shoot (also non-Canon.)The stock lens provided is excellent for general photography and covers pretty much every scope you could desire but I also got a telephoto zoom 75mm-300mm lens to augment my range.When I got my T3i, I was a total and complete novice. It took me months of deliberation and research to decide on this particular camera. I am so glad I did! I HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone who wants to step up from smartphones and point-and-shoots to something a bit beefier but doesn't want to invest a couple months' rent.There isn't a high learning curve and I have mastered quite a few more complicated techniques using exclusively online resources and books checked out from my library.The camera has allowed me to further my creative desires and broaden the horizons for this particular art form, which is exactly what I wanted.

At the time all I had was my phone and a Toshiba Camileo H30. For the start-up of my channel it wasn't bad, but doing vlogs indoors left a lot to be desired as far as quality goes and just shooting in low-light in general would be a pain. So after research and talking to a few buddies. They couldn't say enough good things about the Canon T3i, I had to reconfirm their opinion with those of \"Professionals\" and long and behold almost all the reviews have really positive things to say about this camera.I bought this with a 50mm 1.8 lens and I am super happy that I did, low-light, dark nights (outdoor street lighting), indoors, outdoors it doesn't matter this camera has not let me down. This camera has a ton of buttons and modes for which I recommend reading up on if you decide to move-up from your phone or a point and shoot. After messing with it for about 2 hours I felt confident and I simply love this camera, pictures are nice and sharp, Video (can be shot in 1080p@30fps, 1080p@24, 720p@60p) comes out looking superb, Just be warned ahead of time that all the high-quality photos and videos come at the price of your memory card, especially the video aspect. It will eat up space super quick so I would recommend nothing less than a 16GB (Class 10) memory card to really have a great time with this camera.Also for those who will just buy the body as I did, this camera is classified as a 1.6 crop body, meaning that your lens will actually be a little tighter then what it says. For Example, the 50mm that I purchased really shoots at 80mm (1x50mm=50mm + .6x50mm=30 = 80mm shooting depth), which is pretty tight in spaces between 4 to 8 feet. So keep that in mind when thinking what your needs are, I think I would've been better suited with a 40mm (would shot as 64mm), but that is my fault and it does nothing to hinder the camera's performance when out in the open world.If you want to become semi-serious about your photography and HD Filming, I can't think of a better place to start.

It has been a great introductory DSLR experience for me and this is what I can base my recommendation on and it has only served to improved my thirst for creating better images which has led me to researching materials and training videos to get my skill set up to scratch.I bought the camera with the standard EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens and it is a great learning lens for beginners I can definitely see myself progressing to other high-powered lens as I immerse further into the DSLR world and image photography.

I already have the Canon T1i and have used it and loved it and thought that it would take a lot to beat it but the T3i has.  Using the kit lens from my T1i which is basically the same lens available with the T3i I took fantastic low light shots of my daughter's Christmas tree without a flash.  I used the \"P\" setting with auto ISO and was very happy with the results.  I used a Tamaron 18-270 MM lens to take some low light shots of my house and the Christmas lights and again was amazed at the results.  Noise levels at even high ISO are very minimal and can be cleaned up with a good editing program.  I have yet to explore all the features of this camera or use the HD video feature but if it is as good as the results I have already seen, it will be amazing.  I am retired and have taken up digital photography as a hobby and while I am no expert or even close, I do consider myself to be an informed amateur and always research any camera before purchase so when I received this from my wife without my input I was a bit surprised but seeing the results very very happy.  The camera can be used by someone new to a DSLR with great results and I am sure that someone who is familiar with all the bells and whistles this camera has will produce amazing results.  I used the T1i while my friend used a Canon 1D and I feel my pictures where as good as his despite that the 1D is a superior camera so I am sure that the T3i will produce even better results.

I am an avid home photographer with no desire to learn any more about my camera than to take pictures in the 'auto' mode that comes with cameras.I've always kept a Canon point and shoot and a Sony video cam (~2005) since my first child was born, and have great photos/videos marking many milestones. I held back from upgrading my DV Video cam to a HD video cam knowing that soon enough (2 years?), I would find a single device to take with me that does pictures and HD video. I started looking into such devices in 2010. I was glad I saw the Sony NEX 5 that had high reviews on dpreview.com. Went with it for Christmas when I had my favorite extended family members and their kids with me for the first time with my new born. It was meant to be a season to remember. Guess what? The pictures were too soft when compared to my previos Canon point and shoot. The HD video was better than my Sony DV camcorder though. But the pictures left me 'wishing'. Kept it for a couple more months while checking dpreview.com if new products that did pictures and HD video were out. Then came across the Olympus PEN EPL2. Sold my Sony Nex 5 for half-price and went for the PEN. Even with the PEN, I was found 'wishing the pictures came out better'. There were no other products that I wanted to try as I slowly was losing hope for one camera that did it all. Then came the Canon T3i.BOY! AM I GLAD I BOUGHT IT! This is a regular DSLR and bulkier than the Sony Nex 5 and Olympus E-PL2 which are Micro Four Thirds. But the pictures and video immediately delighted me. The colors were nicely reproduced. The flash lighting in indoor shots was excellent (a main draw-back with the Sony NEX 5 and Olympus Pen E-PL2). Most family shots are indoors and a good flash is necessary.I can say that I have stopped wishin for good pictures and instead enjoy the beautiful pictures from the Canon T3i with the kit lense.

I wish i would have gotten this sooner. I am not camera guru or anything like that. Lack of knowledge when it comes to photography and about cameras.  After I bought the camera some of my friends told me to buy Nikkon. So far I don't regret it.Before I continue I want to say that the next paragraph may be helpful, take for what it is worth from a simple minded person in this area:There is a lot of features to the camera that I am sure that I will never use mostly because i did not see a difference when testing them out.  The movie HD is nice to have and I used it for the first time and I am grateful for it when something happens and need video camera in a matter of seconds. Make sure you read the manual and experiment with the options. Another feature that is pretty cool, you don't have to go through the photo on your memory card one by one when you go through the pictures on the camera, You can break up the photo up to 9 thumbnail so it will save you the time and hassle of pushing the next button.  The battery keeps it charge and doesn't take long to bring it back to a full charge.  The one negative thing for me was auto setting shooting.  I let the camera do all the work and there is a long gap between the auto-focus and when it take the pictures.  I quite often want to take 4-5 pictures in a quick second to get the timing of a little kid who don't want to sit for 15 seconds for three pictures that are the same.Lastly, I read a lot of review the good and bad, and I from a simple point of view: It takes a great high quality pictures, It has all of the bells and whistle (maybe too much for me), but i like to have the options, who knows when they will be handy.  If you are looking for the camera with my mindset, i have to say it is perfect fit for me.  It is a little pricey but looking at some of the pictures i now know that I will get great pictures and not have to worry about all of imperfections of a cheap ($100-$250) camera with a lot of megapixel.

So after shooting around a 180 pictures mostly with the view finder the camera went dead no power to the unit. I also had an error code display, I can't  say  for sure  that I could see the entire code, but the camera stopped working. When this happened I removed the battery, and placed it back in the camera, and then the camera powered on. It  performed flawlessly for about 20 or more shots. The shots I took looked amazing but I also had some bad shots. I will take credit for the bad shots  it was not the fault of the camera. When I was finished shooting,  I removed the camera battery and placed it in the charger. The very next day I went for a photo shoot. I shoot mostly view finder,I shot about 200 photos this time. When I was finished shooting  I turned the camera off. Sometime later I went to use the camera  again, I turned the camera on, and no responded. I removed the battery, and charged it, when it was fully charged I placed the battery in the camera and  it worked just fine. I have not used the camera since.

I bought the body only, then got a Canon 28-105 lens seperately. I recently purchased a 50mm f/1.8 lens as well.The camera is very easy to learn how to use. I watched some videos on youtube and skimmed the manual online while I was waiting for it to come in the mail (I ordered it from a different site around New Year's, so I had about a week and a half wait from when I ordered it) and as soon as I got it, charged the battery and started using it. Before this, I was using my video camera or old point and shoot for stills, but I have used a couple of other people's DSLRs (on auto mode). I've been using this exclusively in manual mode so far and it took a little bit the first day to get used to picking the right exposure settings, but once I got used to it, it's not bad. This camera takes really great photos.Other good things are: compared to my Canon Vixia HF200 (video camera), the battery seems to last a comparable length with video and the recording rate is somewhere around 5.5 mb/s with the T3i, where it goes up to 24mb/s (I believe) on the HF200, so the videos don't take up as much room on the memory card or my computer, but they look better because of the lenses and, I assume, the proccessing. The audio is surprisingly good too. I shoot videos at shows occasionaly(**Youtube search username chunkvideos and look at the Pianos Become The Teeth videos for the best example**), I manually adjusted the audio level to the lowest possible level (it indicated clipping otherwise) and the video actually sounds really good. That being said, when you're not in a loud environment, the internal mic picks up all of the camera and handling noises, so the fact that it has a mic input jack will come in handy in getting better audio.The autofocus works good sometimes. I'm trying to mostly use manual focus unless I'm taking a photo of my puppy running around the yard or something with similar action (which is also hard to autofocus on, btw). I used autofocus the first few days and it wouldn't always focus where I wanted it to (it'd focus on my puppy's nose or toys instead of her eyes, etc). I know there is a way to select focus points, but I'd rather just do it manually, plus it doesn't have full time autofocus while shooting video. Autofocusing on video does not look or sound good with this camera.I haven't used the vari-angle screen as much as I thought I would yet, but even without using it for different angles, it's pretty convenient. I like that I can store it with the screen facing towards the camera body, so it's protected. I also like that when I have it flipped out to the side, my nose isn't against the screen and there is a little extra room for my face when I'm looking through the viewfinder. I have tried \"self portraits\" with it (in quotes because half of them were just me pointing the camera at my face), but it's hard to do without a tripod because neither of my lenses will focus closer than 18\". It's kind of hard with a tripod too, because of focusing before you get to where you're going to stand (again, autofocus wouldn't focus on my face).Continuous shooting and exposure bracketing are really nice features. I also like that you can do both with a timer. Exposure bracketing is something that I overlooked when I was researching camera options, because I didn't know what it was. You can quickly and easily set your camera to take 3 continuous photos with the same aperature, but at different shutter speeds, so it produces an under exposed, normally exposed, and over exposed version of the same shot (assuming you use a tripod or hold the camera really still) and if you use software that can merge the three images into one, you can create an image that shows details in the dark, light, and medium areas of the photo. For instance, in a normal photo of a sunset, the sun would be bright and anything like trees or buildings in the foreground would be dark, merging would allow you to see details in the foreground too.Pros:-Photo quality-Manual settings-Ease of use-Manual focus-Low noise-Good low light shots-1080p video with good quality-Manual settings for video-Vari-angle screen-Mic input jack-Manual audio levels-Small file sizes for HD video-Not too big or heavy-The flash doesn't pop up in manual mode (it hasn't for me anyway)-It actually comes with usable software (I've been doing all of my photo editing with the included software, I think it's called Digital Photo Professional)-It can store camera and lens setting information on your photos (not literally on them, but in the file information)-Continuous shooting works nicely-Exposure bracketing is a cool feature which allows you to edit high dynamic range photos-Able to use a timer and choose how many shots you want the camera to take and if you want it to be exposure bracketed or notCons:-Autofocus hasn't worked well for me-Cropped sensor makes it hard to get wide angle shots without spending a lot on a nice lensUpdate: I've gotten some better lenses since writing this review and the autofocus issue seems to have had to do with the lenses and not the camera.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Those Indoor Portraits that Your Compact Can't Do", "Author": "Greg Scowen \"Author of The Spanish Helmet\"", "ReviewID": "R1FJ55QNPFY4JY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Canon EOS user for about 15 years, starting out with manual cameras and then working my way up to the EOS digital models in 2005.Two years ago, I was getting a little frustrated carrying around a bag with multiple lenses and the camera on holidays.

I resisted and ended up waiting to purchase the T3i, which was the best decision I made. At a glance the camera has a good feel to it and overall has the same features as the T2i. The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen, which I use more often for some of the photos I take. Among the screen, the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not. I am a person to read through and learn the various features the camera has to offer. I am impressed with the lens that comes with the camera for the wide angle aspect of it due to a lot of places I shoot pictures there are a lot of people and requires me to get close to get the shot I want.

I also photograph airplanes and so it helps to have that little bit of increased resolution when I blow those photos up to poster size. If you are only wanting a camera for head shots in a stuido or close up shots of yourself and other people; for a tourist camera, then I would go with the T3 or even the T2, but if you do landscape photography this is the only option. Get a fish eye lens and you will have the best photos of expansive landscapes. I take mine hiking, camping and bouldering.  Definitely invest in a UV filter protector though; it's only about $7, but it has saved my $500 lens from being cracked and is really durable. Tiffen makes a great one 58mm fits for the T3i.

The T3i is absolutely perfect for this.I don't actually care about the video-taking capabilities of this camera, though when I have taken video with it, it's been fine. What I really care about is how well it takes pictures, and for that, it's fantastic. The full-on automatic setting is great, sometimes taking a much better picture than I would have. The \"no-flash automatic\" is what I tend to use most, especially in indoor areas like museums. When I want to play with DOF, the Aperture Priority setting is excellent.This camera performs admirably in low-light settings, often getting shots without a flash that shock me with their quality. In Lightroom, I don't have to do much postprocessing to get my shots to come out looking great. My only complaint is that the automatic setting does tend to overexposure, so if you're in a situation where the lighting isn't standard, keep an eye on that and switch to a more manual setting. It's a lot harder to fix overexposure than underexposure.If I have any complaint about this camera, it's that I would have liked more, or better, indicators via the viewfinder. I find I use the viewfinder -- which is not, by the way, the brightest or sharpest viewfinder I have ever seen -- more than the LCD monitor by far -- to the point where I sometimes don't flip the LCD monitor over at all. And about the flipping -- that's a very nice touch. I don't often use it like one would use a side-view mirror, but I do love that flipping it over protects the screen.Likely, if you're an enthusiast who can afford this camera, you're not going to use the postprocessing techniques in the \"Creative mode\" section of the camera; you'll use an outside tool like Lightroom. I wouldn't put much stock in being able to, for example, apply a magenta tone to your picture. And labelling on-phone is a giant pain. Unless you think you'll forget the location, don't even bother.The kit lens on this camera is actually quite good - I alternate between the kit lens and the f/1.8 50mm that everyone who owns a Canon DSLR should have.

Unfortunately, this camera could not get the job done. The issue was the autofocus. I tested the sports setting, resetting aperature and shutter speed, and various focus settings. I just could not get a clear picture...and I shot almost 1400 before returning the camera. I opted for the Sony a55 and couldn't be happier! Crystal clear action shots with vivid color on the first try. I used a tamron 2.8, 70-200 lens & a tripod for both cameras so the only thing I can attribute the difference to is the camera itself.

The course encouraged students to bring their own camera but their focus was mainly DSLR.

Knowing these concepts I could really see and utilize the power of the T3i and it's capabilities. Over the last 2 years I have photographed many family events and personal travels. I have bought many additional lenses and accessories so I can utilize the potential of the Canon T3i. I appreciate that the camera does not feel heavy in hand and I also like the feel of the grip.

So let me keep it short and simple.If you're new, this camera with a kit lens is NOT going to disappoint. There's so much to learn on it right off the bat that you will not notice any of the things more experienced photographers might complain about (then again, you're spending way less too!). Excellent pictures. Excellent videos. As one reviewer put it 99% of people looking at your photos are going to see a beautiful picture. The other 1% are professional photographers who are nitpicking things you don't care about or notice.Camera takes brilliant pictures in auto, and even more brilliant pictures once you learn you play around with the settings. If you're trying to decide between this and another camera, do what I did. Write down what you want. Then go watch review videos with a pad and paper. Write pros and cons of each, then see what works best for you. I was comparing to the Nikon D5100 and found that since I want to do more with video, I wanted this for its better manual video and audio controls. While the 5100 has somewhat of a continuous autofocus, many complain that it doesn't give you much control and I find the T3i manual focus a breeze to use in video. Allows you to get more creative too.Anyway, whatever you decide, the Nikon and Canon DSLRs are all great cameras. Write down what you want your camera for, write pros and cons of each camera, quit stressing, order, and start shooting!Good luck!", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great value!", "Author": "J. Cronin", "ReviewID": "R32OAHMYLSUGAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything is relative when technology is considered. Between different brands you'll see one does something better than the other. In this case, the T3i's direct competitor (Nikon D5100) is a little better with low light performance, but the T3i does video better. D5100 also seems a little more 'newbie' friendly control wise, while the T3i offers ease of access to more advanced functions. Overall though they're almost identical!I could go on all day about how this camera compares to others, but ultimately that is something you should research yourself when you're making an investment such as this! Consider the ergonomics, the interface, what you're going to use it for, your budget - so on.. Find a camera that works for you!With that, I'll continue with some pros/cons. I'm not going to list things that are available on all DSLRs though (mirror lockup, manual control, etc):Pros:- T3i's quality. The body has a high quality, durable feel to it. Nothing really feels cheap on it.- Image quality. Sharp images (sharper yet with a prime lens), good color quality, minimal lens distortion (18-55) with some minor vignetting (nothing that can't easily be fixed in post processing). The picture quality will ultimately be decided by your lens (and your photography skill).- Video. DSLRs aren't really that great with video, but the T3i offers a \"sensor crop\" zoom function. Basically it'll use a small part of the sensor to record 1080p without skipping pixels on the sensor. This works well for some things but it means you're getting a 3x zoom level so your FOV is going to be very narrow, especially with a telephoto lens. This sensor crop video mode eliminates/minimizes  moire/aliasing issues typically associated with doing video on a big DSLR sensor. There's a whole lot more on this video topic for DSLRs (\"Jello\" effect, getting the proper shutter speed for the framerate, lighting, lens, etc), more than I can possibly include in this review. Google is your friend when learning DSLR!Cons:- Low light ISO noise.. One thing the D5100 does better than this T3i is low light iso performance. Less noise at higher ISOs. That's not saying this camera can't produce some superb night photography, but you'll be using a tripod to get those results.- Lens quality.. both the 18-55mm and 55-250mm IS II lenses are all-plastic body.. It's hard to imagine lenses that costs hundreds of dollars could feel cheap like this. The focus ring on the 18-55mm lens feels gritty and the inner body of the front lens element wobbles within the lens body. The 55-250mm is better overall, but the focus ring still doesn't feel as smooth as it could. Overall they get the job done (and quite well), but I feel kind of gypped when such an expensive (again, it's all relative) camera has such cheap lenses. You can expect to pay as much as your camera body costs (and more) for some good quality L lenses that don't have these minor setbacks.Neutral points to consider:- This is a crop-sensor camera. What that means is the sensor is 1.6 times smaller than 35mm film. This effectively multiplies your focal length by 1.6. So, with an 18mm lens you're actually getting the field of view of a ~29mm lens on a 35mm film or full-body DSLR camera. The big thing here is that with Canon's \"Nifty 50\" 50mm lens, the FOV will be like an 80mm lens (narrow and not very useful inside).- Live view. While this can be very handy for getting good framing, autofocus is slow as hell in live view mode. The camera can still function quite well, however.All in all, this review may have been weighted more towards the \"Cons\", but that's only because it's far easier to address shortcomings than identify things a DSLR does well at in a sea of DSLRs! This camera has everything you need to get great results if you know what you're doing. Overall the camera is superb and the shortcomings aren't remotely close to being dealbreakers. As I said early on in the review, make sure you do your own research and find a camera that works for you!Regardless of what camera you get (assuming this is your first DSLR), get a decent tripod (Amazon has an affordable Dolica Proline tripod that is great), a good 16GB+ Class 10 SDHC card and a DSLR cleaning kit. Other accessories (external flashes, nicer lenses) are quite expensive and things you shouldn't really worry about until you've learned the basics of DSLR photography.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera.

However, it is of course not a cheap investment - especially when you buy the T3i with the 18-135mm lens.  So you are perhaps wondering - was it worth the money?  And the answer is yes!  Even without getting to creative and playing with the variety of manual settings you can make photos in the auto-modes that will make your point-to-shoot camera photos look like photos taken with a cell phone.  The colors and focus on specific objects give the photos more dynamics.  The different modes allow you to select the right auto-setting for the object you are trying to capture.  The screen info on the T3i helps compared to the T2i (my dad has one) when you are new to such camera.  Overall I am very satisfied.  If you are considering to purchase the T3i, then you should think about getting the 18-135mm lens compared to the 18-55mm lens.  Reason being that the 135mm lens gives you more tele and you can zoom more than with the 55mm introduction lens.

I strongly urge anyone buying a camera over the internet make sure you read the customer reviews, because if it looks too good to be true IT IS too good.  Several sites advertised the Canon T3i for almost $100 less but they were scams, I started to buy it at one site but I realized that I did not review this site (I was back and forth between several site) so I stopped the ordering process and checked the site out, it was a scam and people did not get camera but was charged on their credit card.  I really take my time now due to that near miss.  Something like this I order through Amazon.com their prices are very good but most important I feel protected there.  I am not associated with Amazon in any way I just like  the sence of security from them on a big buy.  The Camera is a dream.  I love the viewer.  I did how ever did have to buy newer memory chips with a highere write speed, the picture size is Big and if you take 3-4 shots in a second you may slow down the process with the old memory cards.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "First D-SLR = Infinite Photographic Possibilities", "Author": "Kindra K. Martinenko \"Technology Wiz\"", "ReviewID": "R3SQE36R8F2NVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon Rebel t3i a few days ago directly from Amazon.com.  While I was waiting on the camera to arrive, I poured over youtube videos on the technical aspects of the camera to familiarize myself with all of its operations and capabilities.  This is such a magnificent piece of equipment and the quality is top notch, just like you would expect for a $600 camera.  I highly recommend soaking up as much information as you can because right out of the box, there is so much in front of you that you can become easily overwhelmed by it all.  The first thing that impressed me and kind of scared me, was how dang smart this camera is!  I skipped getting the kit lens (18-55mm) in favor of a \"prime\" fixed-focal length lens, the 50mm f/1.8.  Once I charged up the battery, I put the lens on, and turned the camera on.  I put the camera on Av (aperture priority mode) and pushed the shutter button.  NOTHING, but a disturbing shuttering vibration and noise.  Turns out I was too close the subject I was focused on for the 50mm to handle.  Once I pulled the camera back and locked in on my subject, \"Snap!\", and the picture showed up on the view screen.  I tested different lengths and f/stops to test my limits with this particular lens.  Being that I am quite new to the world of owning a SLR of any sort,  I am learning as I go.I included my first two shots with this camera in the user images.  My very first shot is the pink primrose with the beautiful bokeh (blurred background)!  Pretty decent, considering that this was an attempt at doing a close-up shot (macro) on a non-macro lens.I also included a picture of my nephew wearing his Iron Man mask (second shot).Notes:1) This is my first DSLR.  I have only owned point and shoots, my last being a Panasonic Lumix.  I was feeling so limited by the lack of control and felt my level of knowledge about photography had reached the point where if I wanted to have semi-pro results, I needed a semi-pro camera.2) I contemplated a Nikon d3100, but decided on the Canon because of its good reputation and the quality of their lenses are top-notch.  I think the flexibility and ease-of-use are the two non-technical functions I appreciate the most so far.3) The lens you get will make all the difference in the quality and creativity of your photography.  I highly recommend skipping the kit lens and getting the 50mm f/1.8 or f/1.4 and then move your way up as you learn the camera (for newbies). Then move up to a \"all-in-one\" such as the Canon 18-200mm or Tamron 18-270mm.4) Don't be afraid to take a gazillion pictures, even if they are horrible at first.  In photography, practice DOES make for better results.5) Don't be afraid to experiment.  The beauty of digital is that you can shoot a picture and re-compose it over and over until you achieve the result you want.  Don't let this functionality go to waste.6) Lastly, read the manual!  I know its a knock to some people's pride to read a manual...but Canon has done a pretty good job at going over the functionality.  If you don't want to read a manual, I highly recommend this book by Jeff Revell: Canon EOS Rebel T3i / 600D: From Snapshots to Great Shots.  I started reading this book as soon as I submitted my order, so that I would know what to do and what not to do once I unpacked my camera. This might seem a bit obsessive, but this is a pretty big investment for me and I fully intend to put this camera to work.  Why not learn how to maximize your results at the start?Best purchase I ever made.  I highly recommend the Canon T3i camera from novice to semi-pro.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm Happy", "Author": "Atlas", "ReviewID": "RGSNXSD37VG3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR camera and i'm HAPPY.

In addition to a reliable picture taking machine, T3i owners can experiment with off-camera flash, record HD movies with great audio, and creatively play with their images while they're still in camera. Here are a few of those highlights.Built-In Wireless Flash Control (new feature for Rebels) If you have an external Canon flash unit with wireless slave capability, such as the Speedlite 430EX II, you can fire it off-camera with the T3i. You don't need a separate wireless controller. Options include firing a single off-camera flash, balancing the off-camera flash with the built-in flash unit on the T3i, or operating multiple external flashes. The upshot is that with just one external flash and the T3i, you have a number of flexible lighting options. This is a powerful feature for a consumer camera, putting pro lighting techniques at your fingertips for an affordable price.Vari Angle LCD (new feature for Rebels) The T3i's adjustable LCD is an excellent design for recording video. You flip open the LCD, then swing it out. You can angle up or down, or turn it completely around and fold it against the back of the camera. The resolution is terrific both for Live View capture and playback. When you're done, turn the screen around and secure it face-first against the back of the camera to protect it during transport. This encourages capture from a variety of angles helping you make more interesting movies while not straining your back and neck in the process.Full HD Movie Recording with Controls On the T3i you can record 1920x1080 video at 24, 25, or 30 fps; plus 1280 x 720 video at 50 or 60 fps; or standard definition 640 x 480 video at 25 or 30 fps. Emerging filmmakers can opt for auto or manual exposure mode while shooting video, and even choose between auto and manual options for recording audio. The audio is further enhanced thanks to the built-in mini-stereo mic jack for an external microphone. There's even a built-in wind filter.Video Snapshot Function This feature allows you to record a series of 2, 4, or 8 second video clips, then, without editing, the T3i combines them into one movie that can be saved to your Mac or played via the HDMI port that allows direct connectivity to an HDTV. Each Snapshot is saved to an album after you record it, and you have the opportunity to keep or discard the clip. Once you've captured the various sequences, go to playback mode and watch the fast-paced move you've just created. It's a cool feature that saves you a trip to the desktop movie editor. Once you're finished, disable the Video Snapshot mode to return to regular movie making.Creative Filters After you've captured an image, you can continue to play with it via the Creative Filters mode in the playback menu. There are five to choose from: Grainy B/W, Soft Focus, Fish-Eye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, and Miniature Effect. Once you choose an effect, you can apply one of three different strengths. When you're finished, the T3i processes the image and saves it as a separate file on the memory card. The new Fish-Eye effect is a new addition to the Creative Filter line up, and one of the most interesting effects. Be careful, though, it can be addictive.Setting Maximum Speed for Auto ISO Existing-light photographers will appreciate the ability to set the maximum speed for Auto ISO. Auto ISO, without a top limit setting, can sometimes result in noisy photographs. The T3i allows you to set the maximum ISO speed to a level you're comfortable with so you can use this feature with confidence.The available range is from 400 to 6400. If you're conservative about how high you want the ISO to go, then you can choose a setting such as 800 for the top end limit. But because this camera performs so well at higher ISOs, you can easily set the limit to ISO 1600 or 3200 and still get very good image quality. The choice is yours.Star Ratings In Camera While viewing images in playback mode on the T3i, you can assign a star rating to it. These ratings are transferable to Aperture, Bridge, and Lightroom, but not iPhoto. So when you upload your images to your Mac, the star ratings are displayed to help you immediately identify your favorite shots.Copyright Information Setting When you access the Copyright Information tab in the Menu, you can set the author's name and copyright details for every shot that is recorded with the camera.Image qualityWith either kit lens, the 18-55mm or the 18-135mm, the Canon T3i provides excellent image quality in terms of sharpness and detail. If you're tempted to upgrade to the 18-135mm kit lens for its extended zoom range (29-216mm in 35mm terms), then it's probably worth the bump in price. But in terms of image quality, the 18-55mm holds its own nicely against the upgraded zoom. So don't expect better pictures with the more expensive kit option. Base your decision on zooming range, not picture quality.Even though either kit zoom isn't a particularly fast lens (maximum aperture ranges from f/3.5 to f/5.6 on both), the T3i is a reasonable low light performer because you can push the ISO to 1600, even 3200, and still get quality images.In our lab tests, the T3i performed incredibly well in its test group, earning a word score of Superior in the Exposure, Color, Sharpness, and Distortion categories. Click on any of our lab's test images to view the original files.DrawbacksThe limited amount of physical real estate on the T3i seems to have influenced the location of control buttons. The Menu and Info buttons are awkwardly placed in the upper left corner of the back of the camera. They're not nearly as easy to access there as, for example, the 60D's placement of them on the right side.The T3i would also benefit from the addition of a dedicated movie record button. Currently, you have to rotate the Mode dial to movie mode, then you can initiate recording with the Live View button on the back of the camera. It would be nice to directly access movie recording for those spontaneous moments.And finally, as with most Canon cameras, Auto White Balance produces excessively orange cast when shooting without a flash under tungsten lightingI would recommend that to anyone looking to buy a DSLR and it's probably the best DSLR I know today", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Megan", "ReviewID": "R2E5IIS1RHXLQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera!

The T4i is also out now, but I did not feel any of the feature upgrades were worth the higher price.  The T3i takes great photos, I purchased it though for video work in the field. unlike most people purchasing this camera for home use, or hobby, I use it in my job to make a living.  Theses were the main factors in my decision:  1) Features - Must have manual control, rotating screen (sun is brutal), full HD, manual audio.  2) Bonus - HD digital Zoom 3x any lens on this camera without ANY loss.  3) Weight - After carrying a pack around for 8-10 hours, every ounce matters. This camera is light.  4) Dependable - Tested in 100 degrees and - 10 degrees, has always been there for me when I need it.  5) Price - Can be purchased now for less than the older T2i for some reason, a steal! Use the extra money  for a lens!  6) Cards - takes SDHC cards for quick swap, easy downloads for back up, always go with class 10. * I attached a video I took last night of the moon using the T3i, and the Tamron 70-300mm, VC lens. Digital zoom was x3, lens was at the full 300mm, f5.6, with a 160 shutter. Taken at 1080p, 30p.

I purchased this on a friends recommendation who does professional photography for weddings and other events and he mentioned this one as a great intro DSLR camera for the family. This camera is great for the average home user who is in the market for a really good camera. It's not quite professional grade however it does have many professional grade features. The 18 megapixel camera takes very clear quality images even when blowing them up to very large print sizes. We've printed 11X14 images and they look very sharp. I also really like the HD video feature that it has. I didn't think I would use it so it wasn't a factor when buying this camera but I'm really glad I have it for those short videos. If you need anything longer than 10 minutes you might want to consider buying an actual video camera. The only missing feature on video is the ability to autofocus while shooting the video.As far as taking pictures, autofocusing with the screen on takes a bit longer, if you use the view finder the autofocus seems to work much better and quickly. I'm not sure why this is but it's OK since the battery life is significantly better without the LCD on. We do use the LCD when taking a self portrait and it's really awesome that is swivels and rotates. It makes setting up the timer family portait really easy and saves a ton of time. I can't compare it to any other DSLR's because this is the only one I own, however it's a really good one and I would recommend it.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Film Student: Amazing for an Entry Level Camera", "Author": "William Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R3W1FAN6UVQ1VE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great overall DSLR for the price, not the best under low lit conditions (night time/dark out) but I've gotten a lot out of it but instead of just talking about it, how aboutyou see for your self; I'm a film student and videographer/editor: the following short films, trailers and promos where all shot on my Canon T3i at(Main Channel/Big Projects): Youtube.com/abovethenormfilms(2nd channel/Videography/Promos for work/Media Team): Youtube.com/abovethenormpromos-William Rodriguez", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny", "Author": "hermanator", "ReviewID": "R1J79Z6AKT4CBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is everything I was looking for.

Banici", "ReviewID": "R3G817VL6NALPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Rebel T3i is an excellent camera if you want good professional photography and professional movie making on a budget. I will note, however, some issues I have run into so you are aware they exist and plan accordingly.MOVIE MAKINGSome people (myself included) get this camera for the ability to shoot 24p, 30p and 60p movies through a large lens into a large sensor, which in the world of pro video cameras would cost you many times more, all the above being equal.POWEROne thing I would like to tell you from the start is that if you get a 6 battery add-on power pack for this camera, plan to use it for photos only. For movies, you will go through a battery magazine in a few minutes!Find the AC adapter to use the camera straight from wall power for movies. Such an adapter is available right here on Amazon to buy separately and it will save you lots of frustration, recharge waiting time and battery costs.FLASH (for photos)The MK off-camera remote flashes are well worth the investment, because they will give you the ability to capture amazing photos by experimenting with lighting, color, exposure and shadows.ENHANCEMENTSYou will focus manually when shooting movies with a DSLR, but that is OK because you want to use this camera especially for movie effects such as close-ups or dialogues while pulling focus. A follow-focus device will help here. They range from a few hundred dollars to a plastic strip with a handle on eBay for $14, and an upcoming \"$50 follow focus\" Hondo Garage project to be released soon. All the above devices other than the eBay cheap solution will require a $120-300 rig. To make your rig look impressive (if you film for clients) and to enhance your movie making ability, add a matte box that holds filters or at least one that works as a shade.Zebra stripes, HDR, more control, etcOne gray market utility that greatly enhances photo shooting and movie making is a firmware sidegrade called Magic Lantern. I've used it with no glitches.Tripod, dollyThink Ravelli and Peartree, both available here on Amazon.Lights and studio backdropsYou will want a perfect white, black and green background, and the key to success is good and ample lighting. Neweer and Cowboy Studio among others, here on Amazon.By now you're realizing that making movies on a Canon Rebel T3i is neither cheap nor hassle free. However, it beats spending $15,000 for a cinema camera that needs $600 storage media and a $3000 lens.The lens included in this kit (18-55mm) is excellent for most purposes, and appears to be a favorite for making movies. In pictures it has a slight corner distortion at the widest angle setting, which may go unnoticed unless someone's face happens to be there. Overall, considering the awesome savings and the ability to work like a movie director without a Holywood budget, highly, highly recommended.TIPIf you use another camera to capture other parts of your movie, and the T3i just for the high quality portions (close-ups, pulling focus, dialogues, faces, etc) then make sure you shoot at the same frame rate or close (if your other camera is 29.97 / 60i then use this camera at 30p (closest setting) and interpolate the footage from the other one so both are progressive before combining them. Also do a white balance on both cameras right before shooting.TWEAKINGThis Canon (with minor adjustments and a little patience) can match footage shot on most other cameras if you need to work with 2 cameras; at least it matches my Canon and Panasonic pro video cameras close enough so people can't tell that two or more completely different cameras were used.CONCLUSIONExcellent deal for photographers; a godsent for indie movie makers.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "T3i video recording", "Author": "Harry \"Cheers\"", "ReviewID": "R2E5H6Q5LWAJLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After purchasing the camera, I never thought I would ever use the video recording function even though it has the capabilities of recording in full 1080HD.

The 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilized (IS) Kit lens that it comes with is perfect for getting used to the camera. It's good for those relatively close up group shots, or portraits. Even very small subjects can be brought into focus with this lens. And when your'e ready to upgrade, the 55-250mm IS lens is very reasonably priced (that's what I plan to get next anyway). I would recommend getting a SanDisk Extreme SD card to go with this (at least 8gb). OH! one last thing, the HD movie mode. That was another huge selling point for this camera. Although the Nikon D3100 AND the Canon T2i both have 1080p HD video recording, they do NOT have inputs for an external microphone.

I'd call myself at least a semi-professional, having had 10 different digital camera since my first (a Kodak DC120 that cost $1,000) in 1998, including a number of Nikons and Canons.  There are some very long reviews on this site for the T3i, so I'll spare you the details.  But, I take lots of different digital images (over 6,000 since April with this camera), from action photos of our grandchildren playing in their basketball and volleyball games to macrophotographs (using a Canon 100mm macro)of flowers and other organisms, and I'm almost always amazed by the results - images are sharp and colors are right on.  And a number of times folks around me looking at the results have commented on \"how amazing\" the images are.  Videos have also been lots of fun to take, although the learning curve for getting good video is a little steeper than for still images.  And honestly, if I were going to take very much video, I'd get a dedicated video camera.  This camera, as one might expect, is very versatile, and the important lesson I learned early on is to read the book and go to the internet for advice on how to get the most out of it - some fantastic information there.  Practice, experiment, practice, experiment, etc., and not surprisingly, the more you do the better images you'll get. Common sense I know, but it is tempting and easy to simply set the camera on Scene Intelligent Auto setting and click away, expecting the best (and actually getting a lot when you do).  I rarely use that setting, choosing rather to mostly use the Program AE mode and customize my image taking to the situation.

My previous camera was a Panasonic DMC TZ5, a great little camera that even after 3 years is still pretty impressive for it's size.  A little background on me, I work in the film industry as a motion graphics / special effects artist, so my review might be a little skewed towards the video side.  I bought this camera with a 50mm f/1.8 prime lens.When I first picked this up, I was surprised at how lightweight it is.  The older TZ5 is pretty solid but feels almost as heavy as the T3i!  I shot some pictures during the day, played with the awesome depth of field and got some outstanding pictures.  Great contrast, color, white balance, exposure, everything was perfect.  It was actually difficult to get a bad photo even on the more manual settings.Where I was really shocked was low-light performance.  I got pictures I had never thought I could ever get without using the flash.  Even at 3200-6400 ISO I was amazed by the clarity, balance, detail and noise level.  Yes, you can see the noise, but in my humble opinion I actually like a little noise, to me it gives it a little cinematic flare, but that's just me.  But in my old TZ5 I had to severely decrease the shutter speed so much which made it almost impossible to get a clear shot, and even if I could get a clear shot it was either extremely underexposed, white balance was off, or the noise was just too much.  Again the T3i has excelled in every photo I have shot so far (200+).Even more amazing is when shooting 1080p video.  The exact same settings in photo mode will translate directly to video mode with the exact same results on screen.  It is really quite beautiful.  With the TZ5 shooting 720p video, I had to re-adjust the white balance, exposure and aperture for video, and it was still hit-or-miss which was sometimes painfully discovered late after reviewing the footage.  The T3i also has a standard mount and Microphone input and I was able to immediately mount my microphone for great audio.I'm probably a little biased because this is my first DSLR, so I can't really make a comparison with other DSLRs but I am certainly in love with this camera!

Featuring an 18.0 megapixel APS-C CMOS Sensor and a DIGIC 4 image processor it packs quite a lot of power in a small body. The camera is capable of shooting continuously at a maximum speed of 3.7 Frames per second; which isn't bad. It can also shoot in Full HD at 30 frames per second or 24 frames per second; or 720P at 60 frames per second.The Drawback with video:There is one thing that might make you avoid this camera if you want it specifically for video. It doesn't have the ability to focus automatically when recording a video. It is per say, possible; however, the time it simply takes to automatically adjust the focus takes way too long and is very noisy when using any lens that doesn't have USM (Ultrasonic Motor). This is not a bad thing though if you plan on shooting video in manual focus, it takes a while to get used to it, but the video quality that is produced with this camera is simply superb!The camera features a 9 Point AF system which for the most part in my uses has proven to be decently accurate for the most part. Considering this is an entry level DSLR, it is more than enough for the average user. You can always just manually focus on your subjects and avoid being mistakenly focused on something that you don't want to be emphasize.One of the most useful designs of this camera is the Vari angle LCD display it offers. It is what made the camera unique when it came out and it introduced a wide variety of possible shots without the discomfort that you would have had to go through before. Let's say that you want to take a photo from the bottom up, at a bug's eye perspective; before, you would have had to either lie down on the floor to look through the viewfinder or struggle by looking at the display that was only viewable at a certain spot. Now you can simply take a knee and flip the display in order to compose your shot with ease. The complete opposite of this scenario is also applicable, taking a picture from top to bottom you simple flip the display and adjust to where you can see your environment and subject perfectly.Low Light shooting with this camera can be a struggle, at least with the stock lens that is usually bought with the camera (18-55mm). Pictures begin to look noisy reaching about ISO 1600. They are however still usable. When at ISO 6400 it can be pretty noisy, but any other camera would struggle here as well unless it is a true professional DSLR that reaches extremely high ISO sensitivities. The ISO on the camera is expandable to 12,800, but at that sensitivity pictures are pretty much useless. They will look as if they were taken with a cell phone and noise is observable everywhere even without zooming into the picture. If you want to take pictures in low lighting conditions you have two options: A) You can always use an external flash if possible, or use the pop up flash that is integrated on the camera. B) You can purchase a separate lens for the camera that a wide aperture; such as f/1.2, f/1.4, f/1.8Some of these lenses can cost a lot of money, some more than the camera it's self. Remember though that the overall quality of an image can usually be a lot better with a great lens that an excellent camera with an average lens. The f/1.8 Canon lens runs you about $100, the f/1.4 about $300, and the f/1.2 for either $1,400 for the old version and $2,000 for the newer version.How does this camera compare against a normal point and shoot camera?A main concern by many is if having a DSLR like this will make a vast difference than the average point and shoot camera or high quality cell phone camera. The answer to this question is a simple yes. You will notice the difference with just the first time that you take a picture with this camera. 18.0 megapixels is a lot! There are other camera's in the market such as the Nikon D3200 with a 24.2 megapixel sensor, but in reality... you will never have a need for such a plethora of megapixels unless you are going to be printing out billboard sized photos. 18.0 megapixels is already enough and megapixels isn't always everything. The truth with megapixels is that sometimes too many of them can degrade the quality of a picture. In low lighting conditions a camera with a lower amount of megapixels will out perform the one with a higher amount of megapixels. This can be proven even with the simplest of camera's such as a webcam. The less the megapixels, the more light enters due to the pixels being larger.The body of the camera is tough and is sure to last a long time if taken care of. I have owned this camera since the month that it came out and I don't regret purchasing it. It has never failed me in any occasion. One thing you should note though, if you want to record video with this camera; make sure you purchase a good memory card that is capable of processing the data quickly or else you will find the camera automatically stopping video recording. I would recommend a memory card such as the PNY Elite Performance SDHC memory card. It features 90 MB/s read speeds and won't let you down when recording video. It is also enough to capture continuous shots when shooting in RAW which extends the usefulness of a picture when editing them. The advantages of editing when you take a picture in RAW are simply amazing and is something that no normal point and shoot can offer.Overall I rate this product a 5 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review has helped you out!UPDATED on 12/15/2013", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "William Salisbury", "ReviewID": "RRYAF30UI338N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my Wife because she told me she wanted a Camera that was easy to use and that takes good pictures, I read all of the reviews I could find about the Cannon T3 and the T3i and I felt that the value was there so I bought the T3i.

Most of my photography consists of dogs and nature out kayaking, playing on a beach, or out camping.  I have the Canon T2i, and am thrilled with it all around.  I have two favorite L lenses... the 24 - 70 mm and the 70 - 300.  I also have several primes that I use as well.Since I cannot stand running out of battery, I also use a battery grip.  I recently bought a double harness so I could more easily manage out in the field while using my Rebel with the long lens and my G10 for close or wide angel shots, since I managed to crack the LCD screen on the G10 by carrying them both around my neck.  When it came I realized how off balance it was with one heavy camera and one light so I bought the T3i as an early Christmas gift for myself.I wanted another T2i, because I don't do video OR creative filtering in camera so the changes from the 2 to the 3 didn't appeal to me at all.  I LOVE my T2i, but somehow couldn't justify spending nearly the same amount as the new model cost.The camera came today and I did a few test shots between the two using exactly the same subject, flash, and lens.  I actually have to admit, the ones with the T3i came out obviously ahead of the T2i, even before any editing was preformed.  I was really surprised since I expected them to be exactly the same.I am nervous about the articulated LCD screen breaking off and I wasn't thrilled that the screen doesn't shut off like the T2i did, but I guess both worries are easily solved by keeping it turned around.I do wish Canon would make a STILL camera without the addition of video, but I do understand the appeal of video to some people.  I only used it once with the previous Rebel and I must admit, it was quite good!!!In closing, unless I discover something bad in the next few weeks, I expect this camera will also become a favorite, and congratulate Canon on continuing their great Rebel tradition!!!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "I would definitely recommend this for a friend!!

The only thing that the description doesn't give any information about is the type of memory card to be used. In the manual, they say Class 6 (6 MBps) or higher. And I have purchased a 32GB Class 6 SDHC card, and it can only record 640x480 30fps video. But lets be honest, you buy an amazing camera with pretty cool features and why do you want to compromise on some feature that degrades the whole purpose of the camera.But anyways, I did some research about HD video recording on DSLRs and found that even though Class 6 SDHC cards work great with the photos, they don't work for HD videos. And the best memory cards suitable for the HD video recording are supposed to be Class 10 (10 MBps) or higher. And following that I also found that in some cases Class 10 (10 MBps) might also not work. And I did further research for find the apt memory card for HD video would require minimum of 30 MBps data rate (45 MBps would be better). But I had to compromise and buy the 30MBps version which is quite costly (about $95).So, if you are buying this camera for a photography purpose its a wonderful and great camera.

But as far as >$1,000 HD cameras go, this is about as good as I've seen for an SD-Card video camcorder. The real bonus is that the recordings have a film look to them compared to the common flat \"video look\".There are multiple video formats and if you film at the 60 FPS video setting, you can actually produce some cool slow motion effects with a video editing program.Ease of Use:Pros will probably scoff at the large amount of newb presets, but at least everything can be controlled manually. newcomers and hobbiests like myself will like the time-saving presets. Do yourself a favor and read the manual front to back while the battery charges.Low light pictures:Images look great in high, mid, low, and really low light conditions.My only gripe...The Video mode turns off the viewfinder (since light needs to continuously hit the sensor), and the LCD is hard to see in bright daylight, so focusing can be a chore. But this is only a minor gripe.All in all, this is a GREAT camera for the beginner and hobbiest. It's also a very good back up camera for the professional. This is an easy choice to help you transistion from 'snapshot' cameras to professional gear and I've found the video capabilities to be remarkable for a an SD-Card format camcorder.This is a great camera for vacation pics and home movies and all at a great price!UPDATED: (1 Nov, 2011) I need to contradict my earlier review on the video results. This is an incredible camera for capturing 1080P HD video! I have an XH-A1 and after months of shooting video for my company, the T3i consistently outperformed the A1 in video image quality.

When that happens, it will not work in auto, period.  When that happens, you have to pull on the lens focus ring, until you hear a click and then it will work again.

More 'DSLR' than 'entry level'. Let me use my usual disclaimer, and admit that with so many good cameras around, it is more about what mix of traits or features you are looking for.On that note, the camera's trait mix is as follows. It is a DSLR with 18 megapixels resolution. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is APS-C. That's just one step below 35mm Full frame.It has an optical viewfinder, which works through a pentaprism. That is the classical SLR construction. You are using the properties of light to view the subject before and during the shot. The purists would argue this is the way it was supposed to be- that is, with minimal electronic intervention. The ISO rating is 12,800 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1920x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control the exposure  manually. It does have an external flash option. You would need that for portraits, at least. The LCD screen resolution is a whopping 1,040,000. The sustainable burst rate- for fast action- is 3.7 frames per second. That is a bit low for DSLRs. The camera also does RAW processing which is useful if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. The camera body weighs 515 grams, which is light compared to DSLRs.The T3i is a considerable improvement over the T3. The list includes higher ISO (T3 had 6,400), video is Full HD, and the LCD screen got much clearer. T3i also added a depth of field preview. Personally, I am not a big fan of this feature in general, because it is not easy to use. The screen gets darker as the aperture tries to show you the depth of field as it would actually appear in a picture. It is easier to view it on a screen, and retake it.A nice camera, and a lot improved compared to its predecessor. Somewhat dated when it comes to some traits, compared to other DSLRs.

I am thoroughly impressed with all the function this camera has to offer, cosmetically the body feels more stout than the XTi, not overwhelmingly bulky or cumbersome.

Many moons ago I owned a Pentax SLR film camera and had my own darkroom. I gave up the suitcase full of lenses and filters and all the nasty chemicals for an Olympus point & shoot film camera and then a couple of Olympus point & shoot digital cameras. To be honest, I bought the Canon Rebel because some of the reviews said it was the easiest camera to use for someone transitioning from a point & shoot camera, and it was one of the top-rated cameras on Amazon. A year and three months later I am not sorry I bought it. I think I have some pretty decent photos for an amateur. And I now own four Canon lenses so I've made an investment in it. I managed to get out of the automatic setting but still take most of my photos in P (Program). But I am getting the hang of Aperture Preferred (Av) and Shutter Preferred (Tv). It's very exciting. I see myself getting back to shooting in Manual which was where I was 25 years ago. But believe me, I forgot everything about camera settings in the intervening years so I am starting all over again, and besides, digital is a whole other ballgame from film.

It is a great entry-level and beyond camera.  I'm still growing into it.I purchased it with Canon 55-250mm and 18-135mm lenses which I am also pleased with.Additional add-ons that I recommend for other newbies:  1.  I highly recommend using a Black Rapid strap (mine is designed for women) instead of the neck strap.  It distributes the weight of the camera across the body, not the neck, which is much more comfortable and keeps the camera ready to use but less likely (for me) to bump things.  2.  Invest in a quality lens filter to protect your lenses  3.  Purchase a hood for your lens, it has protected my lens multiple times even though it isn't it's primary purpose.  I purchased a Canon one but it doesn't have to be the branded one.  4.  Buy more memory than you think that you will need.  Remember this camera has video recording!  I have two 32GB cards and I have used a full card while traveling.  5.  Buy an extra battery... or two (I haven't actually needed the second one but definitely at least one extra)I haven't found a carrying case that I love yet (I've tried a sling style, the Amazon & Canon backpacks, etc).

Struggles on the white balance a little, focus points can be unclear, shadows can be dramatic", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3K0ZDSO6X7IL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are plenty of incredible and far more in-depth reviews for this camera that you can read online. This one from DPReview will tell you everything you need to know, and far more than you ever wanted to know about this camera.[...]My few thoughts to add to this...I bought this camera because the T2i's price had jumped since it had become discontinued, the T4i was being pushed and promoted, and as a result the prices for the T3i were being slashed in preparation for the T4i. The camera takes great pictures, and it has rich quality, it can handle a surprisingly high ISO levels.The UI is a little bit confusing, for the most part it's fairly intuitive, but tweaking some of the settings in some of the modes like aperature priority or shutterspeed priority, can be a little less then clear.Outdoors, this camera shines, and handles lighting beautifully for the most part, however, sometimes, the camera for some reason greatly emphasizes shadows depending on the angle that you're shooting at. Of course, adjusting the angle of your shot will change the way your camera deals with the light, and the way it records the light, but there are certain, very FEW, situations where the camera for some reason struggles to properly capture the light correctly and as a result the photos come out very underexposed.Sometimes on indoor shooting the camera struggles with white balance, for the most part the auto-white balance is satisfactory, but at certain points it struggles and you might it necessary to go in and tweak WB settings for the camera, it's something you should be aware of as you shoot, so as to avoid slaving over the computer fixing the WB in all of your shots.Sometimes when the camera is on autofocus, it will choose the wrong focus point, changing the camera's focus point is not exactly intuitive, quick or easy which is unfortunate and annoying. It'd be nice if the camera had a more intuitive and quick way to change the focus point for your camera instead of having to recompose your shot everytime :/But again overall, it's great.

Masters \"Ron Masters\"", "ReviewID": "R2R3E19ZJFBV23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shot film in an SLR long ago (Canon A-1), & had opted for portability lately (Canon SX110-IS). This is my 1st DSLR.Read several reviews & chose this over the comparable Nikons with slightly better sensor technical specs, mostly for the swivel viewfinder.  I had one on a Canon G-3, & really missed it.  Lots of shots my favorite become possible only when I can brace the camera high against a fixed object, or cradle it low in both hands, and frame the shot in the swivel viewfinder instead of aligning subject, camera & eye.Happy with the choice for many reasons.  The range of application, shooting RAW with this 18-135mm lens, is enormous.  Camera+lens is very lightweight, easy to handhold, & the lens is remarkably compact for its range.  I use it as a macro lens (.38 image size, I think, but don't rely on my memory), for some landscapes & portraits, & lots of tight telephoto shots.  It's a great \"walkabout\" lens--shot whatever happen to see, wherever you are.  I shoot mostly aperture priority stills, stopped down to 9 or 11 for sharpness, mostly ISO 100 to minimize noise, but sometimes 400 or higher to get short exposure times.  I've gotten some nice shots of birds in flight or running grand kids, using the \"sport\" mode, which auto focuses while I track the subject, & keeps shooting as long as the button is pressed.  Reviewers claimed that the controls are more accessible on the Canon, and I have found it easy to set useful defaults and make shot-to-shot adjustments in the most important controls.I had been dissatisfied with the lens speed & dynamic range on my point-&-shoot, and was worried that this lens is not very fast & the sensor does not have quite the dynamic range of the competing Nikon.  However, I discovered that my real problem was that JPEG gives you only one exposure for the whole frame unless you shoot multiple-exposure HDR.  Shooting RAW, I can back down the highlights & boost the shadows when the intensity is uneven, and that actually solves my problem.  Also gives me a more natural look that I prefer to most of the HDR I've seen.  The sensor has greater dynamic range than the final JPEG, so even more would provide diminishing returns.  Even with a cropped sensor, I'm not having much problem with lens speed, even for macro shots & indoor light. Graininess at very high ISO can be filtered, but sometimes it's a nice effect.I did eventually get the Canon 100-400mm EF L lens for even longer telephoto shots, & probably will eventually get a high-end wide &/or macro lens as well.  They say you should spend most of your available money on lenses rather than bodies, so it may be quite a while before I upgrade the T3i.I went through a photo drought for over a year, but since I got this kit I'm shooting a lot.  1000-2000 exposures a week on a couple of recent vacation trips, steady use in between, many diverse projects, posting new work on Flickr daily.

I have had the T3i/600D for about 4 months now.I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Note that this is not the latest model. There is very little difference between this model and other later or more expensive \"crop frame\" (APS-C sensor) SLRs from Canon or other makers. Don't get caught up in the spec wars. Concentrate on the basics and in improving your skills, not on the latest gadgetry or features. Picture quality is excellent, once you know what you are doing and practice. Even the 18-55 mm kit IS II lens is decent, especially if you work with it in its sweet spot-- medium to wide angle, and f-stops in the 8-11 range. Make sure you get the latest model (II) of this lens. I also recommend getting the inexpensive but very good value Canon 50 mm 1.8 lens as well.The build quality is excellent, and the camera is intuitive to operate. Controls are convenient. The built-in TTL flash is good for quick convenient snapshots (GN=13), but if you do serious low light photography you'll want an external flash that you can bounce. Get one of the off-brand, manual flashes (such as Yongnuo), and you'll enhance your photography as well as save a lot of money compared to an original Canon flash.  I also highly recommend installing the free, open source \"Magic Lantern\" software to enhance the camera's capabilities. Particularly useful in this software is the \"intervalometer\" (timer) feature, HDR bracketing, and the ability to control the bit rate of the video recording.You typically get about 400-450 shots on a battery charge. The camera comes with a CD containing good software for processing RAW files, editing jpgs, transferring files and controlling the camera via the computer. The included printed manual is thorough and well written, and covers a lot of photography basics in a very readable way.This camera is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to people wishing to step up from a point and shoot camera to something more serious. This camera can produce professional looking photographs.I would also recommend buying a moderately priced tripod (the very cheap ones will break after a few uses so don't get tempted, especially with your $600+ camera perched on it). A tripod significantly enhances your options in various situations (low light or landscape)  and will improve your photographs immeasurably.The only serious limitation this camera has is the relatively slow continuous shooting rate. It is rates at 3+/sec, but in reality it is less if your are shooting in low light or in RAW mode.

Beck \"Always the Devourer of Good...", "ReviewID": "R7FK5RZRHEIZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**Please note that this review was written by a novice photographer.I have been asking my husband for a camera for years. You know how it is....the entire time he is taking pictures with his Nikon D80 (he fancies himself a fantastic photographer...and he is), I am constantly in his ear telling how what I see and envision would make a better picture. I also tell him how he should take a picture of something that I believe will make him the next Ansel Adams. And I complete the photo shoot with,  \"if only I had really good camera, I would\"..... Well,  I guess he was tired of hearing it, and decided to buy me this camera (for Christmas thru Amazon) if for no other reason than to shut me up. I guess it was his way of putting \"his\" money where \"my\" mouth is, and I was delighted.Now what is there to like about this camera.-This camera is user friendly and great for a beginner photographer or at least one that is ready to move from a camera like a Nikon CoolPix. It is perfect for still shots and video (HD). It is easy to select a setting (portrait, action, etc), point and shoot. It focuses automatically (press halfway) and can be manually adjusted (tight or far away photos). There is a menu that allows you to edit and even make images, black and white. **Please note that this is the one feature that no matter how much I read the manual, I can't quite get it to do what I would like. I can edit a picture, change it to black & white, and even use the zoom tool, but when I attempt to save it, it won't.  That is a feature that I will have to continue to fool with. And if anyone can help me, I would appreciate it.-You can manipulate the viewing screen...it flips out and turns (for use while recording video) so that you can view it. Or you can swivel, flip and turn the screen around and collapse it against the body of the camera.  This allows you to see or view the pictures you are taking or have taken.- This camera takes crisp/clear photos. They are amazingly clear.-This camera has a continuously shoot feature/function. It is great for my son's wrestling matches.-This camera has an automatic flash that is useful if you aren't sure about the lighting.-This camera is light (weight wise) enough to carry around for a long period of time (your hand won't get tired), but it also comes with a comfortable and adjustable neck strap. There are also cords that come with the camera so that you can use with the computer or TV.-The battery life is decent. I assume that it also depends on how many videos you do versus still shots. However, I have done both and found and didn't have a problem.  This camera also comes with a convenient battery charger.Overall, I love my new Canon Rebel T3i and look forward to (a) learning everything about it that I can and (2) taking tons of fantastic pictures for years to come.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exciting", "Author": "Valerie Douroux", "ReviewID": "RWFLSL2TZTFPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is everything I hoped for in a beginning professional camera.

Digital photography was becoming mainstream and I purchased a Panasonic and Canon pocket cameras.The images from the Canon were very reminecent of good ol' Kodachrome 25 meaning intensity and warmth color, crispness etc. So when I decided to get back into SLR land it was a choice between the T3i and the simialar Nikon.  After spending time researching the net for comparisons I chose the Canon based primarily based on image comparisons not necessarily features.  After a month with the T3i I can say that you have to read the book and experiment.  The first pictures out of the gate were nice but where was the punch? ...after reading a few chapters the depth of programs and customization of same, led me back to my Kodachrome 25 images.I continue to play with it and burning electrons in my search as I continue to learn how to get more and different effects.In a nutshell, this is one fine camera and would recommend it to anyone. There are the Nikon and Canon die-hards out there that will continue to say their brand is better than the other, but my defining characteristic is that good old K25 look and feel of my photos.From a technical standpoint the menus are well laid out and easy to understand drill downs enhanced by short menu descriptions that even a photo-tyro can understand.

In fact, here is a link to the video I made on YouTube, check it out to see what an novice can do with this camera... [...]All the shots in the video are with the kit lens except the very first moon shot, I borrowed a friend's 75-300mm lens.The kit lens has been great. Sure I would love to buy a nice L-series Canon lens, but can't afford it at this time. I took some portraits over the weekend and loved the results! Here is something to try, put the focus at about 50mm, set aperture as low as possible, make sure your shutter speed is at least 1/60 for handheld (maybe be in the aperture mode so that is automatic), increase your ISO if it is darker, and take some head shots of someone. Put them up against a cool background (a brick or stone wall...) and take a few shots. Really, I have been impressed with the great photos I have been able to take.To take it to the next level also check out Photoshop Lightroom. It is an amazing program and can really help your photos stand out.Anyway, if you haven't been convinced yet from all the other reviews, this is a great camera, I have loved it, have not regretted spending the money for it, and it has brought a lot of fun to my life.

T3i is a really good camera for the price and for what it is. For film this camera is awesome, it has option for an external mic and I would recommend this model over the T2i because of the swivel screen but also for the manual audio controls. The T3i is definitely modeled more for film than the T2i. I heard T2i does well if you get magic Lantern but I didn't want to have to hack my camera software to get the benefits of audio controls that the T3i already has built in. The T3i gives plenty of options for filming it has 1080p 24p, or 720p 60p, and some others that I wasn't interested in. I just care about the film look and some higher frame per seconds to do some super nice slow motion. The benefits of filming with the T3i is that you can interchange the lens and really add more to your cinematography. The only downside to the camera when it comes to filming is that there is about a 12-15 min cap on how long you can film one continuous clip in Full HD, if the clip exceeds 4 gb in size the camera will automatically stop recording, although recording back to back is not a problem, just an inconvenience that make camcorders still the leading cameras for broadcasting. This camera is not ideal for filming events but good for making narratives. The quality is amazing and has convenient controls to change shutter speeds and aperture and ISO. For filming this camera is superior to its Nikon competitor Nikon D3100. For Photography this camera does pretty well, its 18 mp picks up clear and crisp pictures it has a ISO range from 100-6400, but beware that ISO 3200-6400 the pictures have considerable noise. It shoots 3.7 pictures per sec and has a max shutter of 1/1000 not bad a little less than the 60D and 7D but it shares the same sensor as them, it is a great camera if you're learning photography or wanting to get into video.

If you want better quality pictures than the provided kit lens gives you, go buy yourself a Canon L lens for this T3i body. Buying a better body is not the answer to better pictures. It is like stereo equipment, the quality of the Stereo PreAmp/Amp  can only audibly improve the sound just so much. Having overkill amp power and statistical levels of inaudible  distortion, that the ear cannot hear in the first place, does not improve sound quality.

I wish that you could have more frame rate options in 720p and I also wish that ISOs above 400 were a little less noisy.The kit lens is nice, but I recommend that you get a larger telephoto lens.  The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.  If you plan on doing a video shoot of any length, you'll need to purchase additional batteries.  I'd recommend getting a battery/power grip.  They have a cheap one on here that comes with 4 batteries and has a timer for doing delayed photos and time lapses that I'd recommend.Also, for fun, install the Canon EOS Utility on a laptop.  You can use your laptop to take pictures, do time-lapses, change settings on the camera, and more.Technicolor has a picture profile you can download called CineStyle, which is good for color grading your video in post.  Otherwise, I recommend the Faithful picture style that the camera comes with.Check out LegendaryMedia and 8bitDigitalTV for pictures and videos using the T3i.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Should have gotten this camera sooner!!!", "Author": "Ronald Nagassar", "ReviewID": "R7VO2WFNV0UO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the simply the best!!!The iAuto feature is also great for persons who do not have experience with the many features of such cameras.I am simply amazed at the picture quality this produces! it is exactly as i am seeing the object or scene it takes an exact duplicate of it, awesome.The speed of this camera is also unparalled, great for taking shots of my oh so active daughter, over all great camera", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "May be premature, but...", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2B66TUKQUOZ8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome!

Editing is arguably the hardest part of filming. So the ability to trim down footage on the fly is beneficial. Also, The tilty swivel screen comes through all the time.

I love the body design on the 60D, but wasn't feeling the extra debt for the same sensor. If you are an amateur, just grab the T3i.

I recently went on a cruise to Alaska and found myself hiking up a mountain, sweating a lot with the camera around my neck I learned once I made it back to the bottom of the mountain, that the camera was acting up.. I guess some of that sweat ended up in the camera and basically it became a brick.  Once back on the ship, I tore it apart and over night it dried itself.. in the morning it was working completely fine and I have never again witnessed a problem.. learned my lesson however and have since placed a rain hood on it.The tech on this thing is great, with the ability to not only shoot in RAW mode but RAW+ mode, giving you both types of files for each shot.. this is a great time-saving feature, not having to convert from RAW for those shots that do not require the major file size.Leaving it in auto mode, even a child can use it since it is completely auto. My friend who has never used an SLR before bought the T2i at Costco before the cruise so I was teaching her the basics and she caught on pretty quick.  She had troubles with one of her lens when she gave the camera to me to take her picture, I thought it was a hair on the gate but it turned out to be part of the autofocus gear as the autofocus would not function without a small nudge. Upon returning to Seattle she returned it to Costco for a full exchange as they didn't have any in stock, she ended up buying a new one when in Texas and even saved a little on the tax. That being said, and the fact that hers was the T2i and this review is about the T3i.. the only real difference was the retractable viewfinder which is a must for me, that and the video mode offers a few more enhancements but I don't believe anyone should be buying a DSLR for the sole purposes of shooting video but that being said, you most certainly can use it, especially with all the available remote adapters (ie: focus puller, cables)The battery life is very good.

I bought a used Canon EX back in the 70' when my first son was born. Over the years I must have taken a million pictures with that guy. As time went by and digital technology got better I bought a Sony Cyber-shot 3.3 maga pixels. It has a fairly large Carl Zeiss Lens and took beautiful pictures but was slow. When my youngest son started playing basketball I needed something faster I went back to my Canon 35mm camera and got good shots but the digital age has spoiled me and I hated having to wait for prints to be developed. I went ahead and bought a Sony Digial Handycam and took movies of his whole high school basketball and football career. Fast foward to 2011. I decided that I needed an SLR camera again. I was missing too much with the point and shoot camera that I had. It was good for shooting outdoors but in low light situations it did poorly. I started shopping around for SLRs. After reading a lot of reviews and it came down to a Canon or a Nikon. I went with the Canon because I had history with Canon and felt comfortable with it. I bought it from Amazon, they had a summer deal going on and I got the long lens added to the package for $30 bucks. Out of the box this guy is fantastic, it takes beautiful low and very low light pictures. Everything I have shot with this camera has come out sharp and crisp. I bought a DVD telling how to get more out of this camera and am amazed with it's capabilieies. I'm trying to learn how to do everything that is possible with this camera but that'll take a while.

My experience with the extra f-stops, ISOs, lens stabilization felt like being let out of jail! The photos came out of camera requiring minimal tweaking in Photoshop; a real time-saver! I was very pleased with how well the built-in flash worked (the one that came with the PS Pro was feeble at best). I have a Canon 430 Speedlight and never needed it once, but as I begin to take more time with flowers and other macros, I look forward to using the Speedlight as a wireless flash. The most pleasant surprise, though, was the performance the Tamron zoom lens. WOW! Sharp at all focal lengths. I opted for this lens over the newer Tamron 18-270, which is considerably more compact, but the reviews showed significant compromise in sharpness as it zooms out. Although the 70-300 is BIG, it isn't too big, and it makes great photos! This was my retirement gift to myself. While I retired in January, I took my time on this purchase and glad I did.

The camera itself is very sturdy and well made but feels very plastic like when you first touch it which could be a dealbreaker for some. The settings and menu is easy to navigate through and the rotating screen is good for getting those perfect angles. The 18-55mm lens that is standard with a majority of dslr's is above average for taking pictures or video when doing this as a professional but other lens out there can give you much better quality and that perfect movie look. The cannon 50mm should be bought next after you buy this.  The 75mm to 300mm lens reminds me of a sniper scope which is too cool and can get those far off shots but without a tripod is very shaky.The camera can be equipped with microphones too and XLR cables for sound recording.

I was so excited that I couldn't wait any longer and I buried it in mounts of tissue paper and ribbons and headed to work to give it to her. We told her mother what we had done and she started crying right on the spot nearly ruining the surprise. At first when we gave her the present she thought it was a joke, her family didn't give each other presents and she was extremely unused to people doing genuinely nice things for her for no reason, threw the tissue paper around at everyone and then she got to the box and when she opened it she froze and just started bawling her eyes out. It was the happiest I have ever seen her, and every time she looks at that camera I see how excited she is and how happy it makes her that she can photograph everything how she really wanted.

I bought a supposedly very good point-and-shoot camera from Canon (ELPH 310HS) two years ago and thought that would solve the shutter speed issue when taking my children's pictures. But it did not. Finally I had enough of that sluggish and decided to take a look of this DSLR.Some of the reviews really make me pause, especially those suggested that if you only want to use Auto feature of this DSLR, you better buy a high-end point-and-shoot camera instead. To be honest, I don't plan to use features other than Auto. But my current point-and-shoot camera falls short of my expectation and I don't want to try a new point-and-shoot, which may be only marginally better. So I finally took the chance. I must tell you the experience so far is liberating. I could take pictures whenever I want without that dreadful delay, which ruined so many precious moments. Now I could concentrate my mind on taking beautiful pictures instead of pressing that shutter button frenetically. The only thing I don't like is the weight of this camera. However, I am more than willing to sacrifice a little weight for beautiful pictures.Since I hate to switch lens all the time, I bought the 18-135 one instead of 18-55. So far it meets all my shooting requirements. I have since taken so many beautiful pictures which I don't think it is possible with my point and shoot.  The one thing I still look for is a good all-purpose camera bag. After reading through a lot of reviews, Lowepro Passport Sling seems a good fit - easy to use and comfortable with enough storage for both camera and personal items. Will take a look in the store this weekend.

I bought it as an entry-level DSLR for use in typical family situations (kids, sports, travel, etc.). We had a pretty limited budget and I was worried that I was going to buy a camera that couldn't deliver the kind of photos I want at this price point. Happily I can say my worries were unfounded.I'm sure the Nikon is also a great camera, but given the terrific price of this camera it's the superior option.After my initial use, here's my observations:1. It's easy to use. I'm not a pro, and while I don't mind fiddling with settings to get a superior shot, this camera has done a great job in auto mode for all sorts of different scenarios.2. It's fast. Having spent years with several good point-and-shoot, I've always been frustrated with the lag between pressing the shutter button and getting the shot. With this camera, that's no longer an issue. It quickly auto-focuses, fires the flash if necessary, and captures the shot. Even better, the flash recharges rather quickly so I'm no longer missing the 2nd, 3rd, etc. shots while waiting for the flash to recharge.3. It takes great pictures. The richness of color, the depth of the photo, and the clarity of image are all wonderful and confirm for me why it made sense to go to the DSLR. I've taken tons of close-ups of my kids and can't get over how beautiful these pictures are. And using a 75-300mm zoom lens (which has a $150 discount when bundled with this camera!) I'm able to capture tight shots from across the room.So if you're in the market for that first DSLR at a modest price, you'll be thrilled with the T3i.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "katie", "ReviewID": "R39MPZWKBLCAWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS MY FIRST DSLR CAMERA AND IT IS EVERYTHING I WANTED AND MORE!!

I got this camera because I wanted something to do with video blogs with that had really good interchangeable lenses. What sold me on this camera over other cameras was the manual controls and the 1080p video.Really the manual controls are the most important feature to me in a digital SLR camera. Being able to adjust shutter speed and aperture are a must. If you don't understand or want more information about shutter speed and aperture filthy to ask a question to this review and I'll get back to you on it. And this camera thankfully allows you the ability to adjust both of them.For me being with you 1080p video was a most important thing and no other camera in this price range at the time of buying mine could do 1080p with manual controls. In the video looks great and the best part is that you're able to adjust your shutter speed for high light or low light situations. Another benefit to using something like this over dedicated cameras for video recording is you can change the lenses. This was the second most important factor when I decide to purchase this. Being a little slap on a 50 mm fast lens (very high f-stop) means I can adjust to basically any lighting situation I run into while recording.And the video from these cameras looks amazing when you have the lighting f-stop and shutter speed all set correctly. There's a reason that many independent filmmakers run digital SLR's as their video cameras because they just have so many abilities. And to me future proofing a purchase is very important because you can take 1080p and turn it into 720p and it looks great but you can't turn 720 and a 1080p without ruining some of the video quality so to me it was worth the hundred dollars more to get this camera over any other.I also recommend getting the extended battery grip for a camera like this. It had so much to what you're able to grip and hold on the camera to me just feel so much safer having a nice battery pack to hold onto. This is especially important if you start using larger lenses or if you're out shooting for extended periods of time. Below is a nice grip that comes with extra batteries which are also necessity.Battery Grip Kit for Canon Rebel T2i T3i T4i T5i Digital SLR Camera Includes Qty 2 Replacement LP-E8 Batteries + Vertical Battery Grip + More!!Thanks for reading!If you'd like to know more about digital photography leave a comment on this review.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great photos and video", "Author": "mshahmd \"mshahmd\"", "ReviewID": "R2E77OXOR6Z37S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Takes amazing photos and videos.

It's not too expensive, and it performs extremely well. However, this camera is better suited for photograhy, as indicated by the slightly restricted menu in movie mode. For photography, you have full manual control over pretty much every aspect of your shot, whereas in movie mode, there seem to be a few things missing.Nonetheless, it shoots very well, with no complaints. Just make sure you get your shutter angle at 180 degrees and your videos will look flawless.My only qualm is that at 60fps, the video doesn't record very smoothly, even with my 80mb/s SD card. There are a few glitches in the video, but it still looks fairly well.I got this camera with the kit lens, and it works, at least.

I switched from point and shoot to a bridge camera (Sony DSC HX200V) to DSLR.  I've had it for 9 months and have taken 2000+ photos with it.  It's been a great camera from the start: beautiful image rendering (not blotchy like the Sony even though they have same pixel size), really good with low light situations (I recommend using a tripod), intuitive user interface, and fairly sharp images with kit lens and the Canon 55-250mm lens.  The price for this camera is good for the quality, especially for a DSLR beginner or amateur.  I chose this over some Nikon cameras because it felt more intuitive and comfortable, especially with smaller hands.  The live view with vari-angle screen is nice.  It allowed me to take shots at awkward angles easily.  However, I don't use Live View or auto-focus often because using auto-focus and with Live View takes a long time to focus and capture images, even after I've adjusted Live View shooting modes/options.  Sometimes the camera will not capture/record the image if it can't focus.  I've missed many shots because of this.  You'll need to switch to manual focus and/or not use Live View.  The battery life is pretty good for this camera - about 350-400 images (~3 hours of shooting time).  After market batteries work just as well as Canon batteries and are way cheaper and more affordable.  The Polaroid macro filters available on Amazon are a nice and inexpensive addition to your kit (~$15).  It's allowed me to take some really nice macro shots with the kit lens and allows me to cut the minimum distance for the zoom lens (makes it much easier to shoot indoors with zoom lens).  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this camera as it's easy to use and comfortable to carry around.  I rate it a 4.5/5 stars due to the issue with Live View and auto-focus.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE", "Author": "Amanda", "ReviewID": "R2BXLOPCLADUW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this from a Canon Rebel XS.

My previous digital camera was a point and shoot style. We had been debating taking the plunge and purchasing a DSLR camera. Here are some of the highlights.Value: If you keep an eye out you may be able to purchase the camera in conjunction with an extra lens rebate deal. This is how I got the camera and the total package was a bargain.User Friendly: A DSLR can be intimidating with all of the buttons and options available. The camera is setup to handle a beginner from day one. All of the menus have clear explanations of the functions. The camera has a fully automatic mode. This means it can operate like your point and shoot camera until you learn the extra features. There are also separate auto functions that allow you to make some adjustments without going fully manual.Focus: The focus speed and quality is incredible with a camera like this. It\u2019s great for taking pictures of kids. You can easily capture several shots in a row of that special moment. There\u2019s no waiting for a slow point and shoot to achieve focus.HD Video: The camera can also function as a camcorder. The recording quality is HD. The camera has a fold out/tilting screen to make video recording easier.Battery Life: The battery life is incredible. If you use the eye piece for shooting and the LCD only for viewing the shot the battery can easily last long enough that you\u2019ll forget when it was charged last.We\u2019re extremely happy that we went with the T3i.

Most people might think that this would be a downgrade from my past cameras but the funny thing about photography is, if you have a camera, you have all that you need.This camera does everything I need it to do. The sensor might not be a full frame but I make up for it by using higher quality lenses.The video capabilities are great.The one thing I would have to say, as a word of wisdom is...buy a cheaper body that will do everything you need it to do (minimum).

It frees me up from composing all my shots at eye level. You could get down low and get up high. Anytime I use a camera without a tilt screen, I cringe.Digital Zoom (for video) - My Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras is a great, versatile lens for video or photography. But it can only zoom in so much. This feature is a life saver because I could get that extra reach. Although, I only recommend using the lowest setting (3x). Anything higher and you'll start noticing the \"digital\" side of it.Snapshot Mode (for video) - This is great for a lot of things. On vacation I was able to summarize the whole day using 4 second snippets. I shoot tutorial videos and products reviews and this shooting b-roll really easy. It especially comes in handy when I take it into my editing software Vegas Pro 12 because all the little clips I took are combined into one.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Piece of Equipment", "Author": "barry stepp", "ReviewID": "R37DUN0RYDP2QS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best camera I have EVER had!!

It's relatively cheap for the quality that you get out of it. My passion for photography was always with me from a young age but I only recently really got into it. I bought this camera in future shop downtown Toronto last year December. The body is made of plastic and if it gets lightly scratched or nicked rubbing the area with your finger removes the scratch. I was blown away by the quality of the pictures this camera provided me with. It was my first DSLR ever. I used to use a Kodak 5MP point and shoot and then moved to my Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc 8MP phone. When I got this camera I dived straight into using manual mode. It is the best way to learn. I live in the Caribbean on an island called Trinidad and Tobago. It's too expensive to ship items out of the country or fix here so I needed to make sure the camera works perfectly. I used this camera in doors and out doors in very cold weather and it held up amazingly. I was a bit skeptical of the Flip screen, living in Trinidad if it broke off or damaged it would be too expensive to repair. (Might as well buy over a new camera body). My fears are no longer, I constantly flip the screen whether it's for video recording of picture taking. It's well designed and built. It is a crop sensor camera which means the lens length is longer. Multiply the 18-55mm standard kit lens by a cropped 1.6 sensor and your lens becomes 28.8-88mm. While it is true most times that the glass (lenses) you buy for your camera are what make the image look amazing because of the optics etc..I have read online many times where people cry down the standard kit lens you get with this. This kit lens is an amazing lens for learning on, so if you're new to photography go ahead and get the lens on the body. If your more of a seasoned photog well you will know to buy the camera body alone and hopefully you already have some prime glass. Checkout some of my pictures on flickr at amazon won't let me paste the link so here is how to see my pictures. In the URL type in [...]  Many of these pictures were taken with the Canon EOS Rebel T3i.Update Wednesday 20th March 2013This Camera Body is the best, I have taken thousands of photos with it already and it's still going strong. Definitely be careful swapping out lenses in any windy area that you know could potentially carry dust, dirt or sand particles that could get into your camera. I took my T3i on the beach last week to get some shots. I got down low enough to get a couple shots but it never touched the sand. However I was swapping out my telephoto lens for my kit lens and some sort of particle got onto the mirror of the camera. I could see it through the viewfinder. Got me scared I tell ya! I was lucky though I was able to blow it out on my own right there at the beach without it going anywhere further inside near the sensor. I got some awesome shots. It rained very lightly so the camera did get a few drops of rainwater on it. Stashed it in my camera bag till I got to shelter and gave it a quick wipe down. Still works. I flip the screen out more than I thought I would, up to now it's still solid as a rock. I only used one battery that day I didn't need to swap another battery in, the camera was on for more than 4 full hours and got around 550 shots that day. I did notice at times of above average use the grip area near the battery compartment did get relatively warm as the battery got hot. When I mean hot I don't mean extremely hot but you can tell the difference. Check out some of my shots on flickrUpdate- Wednesday 4th December 2013Hey Everyone, just giving a quick update. My Canon Rebel T3i will be making a year in about 14 days or so. I am still in love with this camera, even more than on day one actually. I only shoot in Manual Mode and RAW files. This Camera is a BEAST!! Since I last updated my review of this camera I have used it particularly at outdoor,water and powder based events. IN particular Hardcore Caribbean, Water Wars and Kaleidodash Trinidad. Each brought a different challenge. The hand grip area is perfect for holding for long hours. All buttons are still in tact and none are loose. The Flip screen is in perfect condition. 0 scratches and 0% failure. This camera did get soaked down at the cooler party called water wars. I was literally soaked down by a similar hose to those firefighters use. My camera was soaked, all the buttons got wet all the screen. Ended up giving it a quick dry down but seeing as I was soaked as well the camera stayed wet for that entire evening event. At kaleidodash, powders were thrown on me and got onto the camera body, lenses and flash. I tried my best to clean out the crevices of the camera but to this day the coloured powder still remains in between a couple of the buttons and the Canon logo. I used one lens in particular for these events, the 24-105mm F4 L lens which has a small rubber gasket to help fight water from getting in. The flash used for these events was the Young-Nuo YN 560 3.As of today I have clocked 26,155 shutter actuations on this camera in less than a year. The camera is starting to show some signs of wear. The front of the hand grip area of my camera is now slightly pushing out. It could be the sealant is giving way. This could be because of the soaking it got (did shoot in light rain a few times as well) mixed with the constant heat in the Caribbean. My camera screen did flicker once when I put it on but at the time it did this I was using an after market battery. I don't usually record video however i do small tests for my personal use. At times I do find there is a white noise line in the playback of the videos. Not sure what that is. The lens checks out fine. I noticed when I set my camera lens to auto focus in relatively dim light it forever searches for a subject to focus on which is too slow for me. It's faster for me to manually focus and shoot at the night parties. The highest ISO I mostly shoot at is ISO 800 but am noticing a bit of quality degradation.I am looking to upgrade to the Canon 70D for the new year due to the 'better' specs. I need the higher ISO for many of the night events I do. Double the shutter speed is a bonus even though I haven't had the chance to shoot at the T3i's max 4000. The Weather Sealing is much better for the shooting I do. If I had the finances I would have moved directly to the Canon 5D Mark 3. I don't look forward to built in Wifi or Touch screen. Especially having used my cell phones touch screen with a slightly sweaty hand. I won't be putting my T3i down altogether yet though. The T3i will act as a backup of mine when I get the 70D. I have recently met a person who invested all his money in buying a T5i and a backup T4i both brand new with some basic lenses.

The picture quality is no doubt amazing, the 18 megapixel sensor delivers exceptional performance. I'll upload some pictures that I've taken with it. For beginners, I strongly recommend auto settings for your pictures until you get used to the camera, and want to experiment around. The T3i is not a hard camera to master. In fact, all you need is a full battery and a good lens, and you're all set, just switch it to auto and shoot away. The screen on the body of the camera is also very high quality, on my 20d, the screen is very small and dark, therefore very hard to see in the sunlight. The T3i screen is very bright so it is very easy to see. The ports on the camera include a micro hdmi port, digital av (cable included) an SD card slot, the main storage for all your photos, a 3.5 mm headphone port and another port that I'm not sure what it is.

Lagonick-Weitzel", "ReviewID": "R25QZ2S47EA45X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will preface this review by stating that I am not a camera expert and am still learning much of the functionality of this camera.  I do know the concepts of white balance, aperture, frame rate, f stops, shutter speed and other functions however, I am not all that familiar on their use and which settings are best for which shots.  I have worked with a higher end video camera and do know some things about shot composition and such, but again, only at a basic level.All that being said, here is my review.A simple two-sentence, simple, bottom line review: This camera allows me to capture ideas and shots, even in automatic mode, that if attempted with a simple point and shoot camera would look like garbage.  It has enabled me to make ideas I've had in the past into a reality which makes it worth the money.OK, so maybe that doesn't cut it for an in-depth review.The Canon T3i has a fairly rugged design and feels good in the hand.  It does not feel as heavy as it looks and has a variety of easy-to-access controls for adjusting all manner of settings and features on the camera.The camera is simple enough for a beginner to take a quick glance at the included guide, throw it into Automatic + mode and capture some great shots right out of the box.  However, it is also complex enough that a more skilled photographer or someone who wants to become one will have all the room they need to compose magazine-worthy works of art.The lens that comes with the camera, the EF-S 18-55mm is a great starter lens for medium to close up shots.  My wife and I purchased this camera from another retailer along with a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens.A WARNING: To those hunting for great deals out there, do not be duped into getting a package deal with a poor telephoto lens as an add-on.  Always research what you are getting, otherwise you can end up with a cheap telephoto lens that has no image stabilization.  Image stabilization is what keeps the lens and image balanced and is an absolute must for a telephoto lens.The above lenses are of the same family and will give the average photographer the variety they will need to accommodate the majority of the shots they will be taking.  However, Canon also has an extensive line of lenses in their EF and EFS family that will fit this camera body for higher image quality or specialized uses.The photo quality is superb.  The average user will be satisfied with the 18megapixel image compressed as a 5MB Jpeg file.  Advanced users will love the access to Canon's RAW format, which is literally the digital picture data as captured by the image sensor in the camera.  This allows for advanced tweaking and manipulation of the photo.The T3i does have a full 1080p HD video mode, however, I have not used it at this point in time and cannot review it for that reason.  However, I can say that if the image quality of the still images are indicative of the picture quality of the HD video, it will be a treat.Overall, I will say that this camera is well worth the money for someone looking to take a step up from the dull world of point and shoot.  It will give a user room to grow and learn more about photography.  For more advanced users it is a great mid-range option that has a huge level of control over shots.  That being said, this camera, like any tool, is only as good as its user.  The A+ mode will allow for pretty good shots without adjusting settings, however, a user will get the most out of it by learning more about photography and delving into the full feature set of the camera.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Drey", "ReviewID": "R1CGCLKAGVW2KM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.

Also, this cam is very reliable in all sorts of temperatures. Haven't had a single problem with it so far and I don't expect any.

However, with a Rode VideoPro mic, it's fine to record voice only audio straight into camera (no JuicedLink or Beachtek).

Take the cons with a grain of salt considering this camera's pricePros:-Articulating screen makes shooting at odd angles easier- Relatively inexpensive price for a good selection of features-Video quality is great (if you really want good video go with the T4I instead)-Good button layoutCons:-This camera isn't meant for fast-moving subjects because it shoots a low amount of frames per second.-Picture starts to get grainy around ISO 800, noticeably grainy at 1600 and unusable above that amount even with heavy editing.-No audio jack, which makes it hard to monitor audio levels without external equipment. Very few cameras have an audio jack and are high-end models.Overall, this is an excellent camera and is a good first DSLR. I plan to upgrade to a 7D or 5D mark iii once I have the money.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compared to the HF G10", "Author": "DK \"Coach\"", "ReviewID": "RURNWBGAQITAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this as both an upgrade for stills and to compliment my Canon HF G10 for video.  I'll start by saying that it's a great still camera - no surprises really.  It's as good as the other entry level Canon's.  The \"creative\" features are a little silly if you ask me, but easily ignored.Video:  The quality (using my 85mm 1.8) truly is outstanding.  Go watch some semi-pro stuff on Vimeo - this camera can hang with most stuff there.  Manual focusing is a real trick - and on that alone, I would not recommend this as a video camera for the casual videographer.  I wish there were some settings between Auto and Manual (like aperture priority, shutter priority, etc).  Full manual is simply too much work for many situations, and the full auto leaves something to be desired.  I also wish they had put more energy into the audio.  You cannot monitor the audio while recording (with either headphones or even audio levels).  A level is visible while setting the record level, but not while recording.  This oversight really puts a damper on the camera for me, and I have a hard time believing that it would really have increased the cost too much to simply add a headphone jack.I use the Rode VMP, and have had some difficulty getting the audio just right.  The onboard mic is garbage.  I have not gotten around to trying my other mics (lapel, wireless).  Get ready to spend a lot of time getting the settings just right.Still, my overall opinion of the camera is good.  I intend to use it to compliment the G10 (a terrific all around video camera).  The T3i does static shots very well (think: interviews).  The depth of field available is amazing and it performs well for artistic shots (just be prepared to spend time learning how to follow focus).  As to general video shooting and anything handheld, I'll stick to my G10.UPDATE:  I'm quickly becoming spoiled by the quality of the video on the T3i.  I find that I rarely use the G10 anymore.  The quality of the video on this DSLR is really something and I've got the VMP figured out (+20 gain on the mic, and manual audio on the camera set at 8 or 9 clicks above zero).  I also shoot exclusively in 24p.  On the T3i, this is amazing.  I do find that I'm switching back and forth between a 1.4 30mm and the 1.8 85mm a lot (it's way harder to just move back and forth with video than with stills).  Still, it's all about the prime lens with this camera.  I'd recommend at least getting a cheap 1.8 50mm.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i", "Author": "Caroline", "ReviewID": "R3JC8DMUYZ4BLH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for over 6 months.

I was not disappointed and thought to write one myself.  I needed a camera for a medical trip I was taking to Port-au-Prince Haiti. I had some narratives that I wanted to capture while working there and knew that a good camera was needed.The purchase was my first quality DSLR camera. As a psychologist I am often amused by the mental/emotional attachment we give to things like tools, PC, and cars...  I feel like I need this dang thing with me all the time, it holds a high level of mental attachment for me.As a first time DSLR user my learning curve was about 3-7 days for functions and creative quality shots. (But that was just to get walking and functioning, I continue to read and learn.) The auto modes of course require very little learning curve travel.On my PC when I zoom in on some of the shots I took I am amazed at the depth and resolution. One landscape picture easily becomes 100s with the right software.  One shot I took over some of the Haitian rubble was of a group of teens shouting and waving at me. They were a bit less than \u00bc mile away. I waved back. When I blew the shot up, whoops. One of the boys was giving me a particular hand gesture common to most NJ drivers.Today I am off to buy my 11 year old son his own good camera, not a T3i.

I have never once regretted my purchase. Even when I see people with 7D's and 5DMKII's, I am still thoroughly happy with this camera. I even wrote some articles on my blog about it.Why I like it:1 - light-weight... yes, most pros will decry the plastic body, but for me, I've begun to see this as a plus. The camera is a lot lighter than the Canon metal bodied cameras, and has survived a couple nasty falls with no damage. I try to shoot with a tripod as much as possible, but most of the time, I just don't have time to mess with a tripod - the lighter weight helps.2 - Specs are more than just \"good enough\"... the specs, when lined up with the 7D are still quite impressive. The only real trade-offs are slightly slower bursts, and a few less focus points. Sensor sizes are nearly identical, and they share the same processor - leading me to believe the t3i's slightly lowered specs are artificial software limits.3 - It's versatile... it does great for both video and stills, even boasting a few better features not found on the 7D (or even 5DMKII for that matter).

But these are pretty minimal for  how great it is (and that it's not a pro level camera).The lens is good all around for a starting kit lens, and has served me well, but you might be better off investing in a quality lens right off the bat, as these will stick with you longer than a camera body (something like a 17-50 or 55 f/2.8 as a walk around).

The kit lens is good (I got the 18-55mm), although I have been lens shopping and the kit lens is just part of my case now.  However, it still gets used almost as frequently as any other.The IS system is great, and eliminates a need for a tripod for mid shutter speeds.  I have some steady hands so I can go lower than most, but friends have used the camera and gotten some really sharp shots at slow speeds that would be impossible with older cameras.Overall an outstanding buy and a camera that will, thanks to the EOS lens system, grow with you.

Our previous camera was a better point-and-shoot but didn't take great pictures ever. We wanted a camera that could take close to professional quality photos and this one works great.  Since I bought the camera I've purchased an extra lens (sigma 30mm f/1.4), a side-slung DSLR bag and a few other accessories. The stock 18-135mm lens is more than sufficient but I wanted to ability to take more artsy photos and the 1.4 aperture allows for that.  I would highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to start into the DSLR world. Do your research, first on which of the big two brands (Canon or Nikon), then on the model you want. The brand you choose will most likely dictate your whole DSLR life and the model you choose is really based on what you want to spend.  My biggest concern was how often this bigger camera would be left behind when going out. I debated getting a DSLR or a mirror-less ASP-C / Micro 4/3 and I'm very glad I chose the full DSLR form-factor. Setting the settings and taking pictures are much easier with the larger size. Buying a smaller over-the-sholder bag that only fits the camera/lense and the charger was what really enables me to bring the camera almost every where. I would highly recommend it, I purchased the Caselogic SLRC-201 and have no regrets.Again I'm very happy with the purchase and since the purchase of the smaller bag, I've never left the camera behind due to the size.Oh yeah, it takes fantastic pictures too.

Davis \"famousdavis\"", "ReviewID": "R3JOQLF0YF053O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "QUICK SUMMARY:  Be sure to format the SD card before using your new camera!  I mysteriously lost one day's photos after a two-week vacation, and I suspect the issue may be with not formatting the SD card beforehand.BACKGROUND:  I bought this camera (my first DSLR) before taking a once-in-a-lifetime tour of several national parks in the western U.S.  I got the camera on a Saturday and by Tuesday I was on a flight to Las Vegas.  I took fewer than a dozen photos before leaving on vacation, so I mostly used the fully automatic setting for all my shots.  I've owned Canon point-n-shoot cameras for many years, so I simply opted to go with a make I already knew something about.  That, and the hugely favorable user reviews here on Amazon made this an easy choice.WHAT I LIKED:- With virtually no preparation at all, I began taking great photos of the national parks we visited.  The colors and intentional blurring of the background scene help the photos look terrific.- The camera was surprisingly (to me) light in weight; however, after having it strapped around my neck for hours and hours, it did feel a little heavy.- If you are used to using Canon point-n-shoot cameras, this DSLR uses the same kinds of icons and abbreviations on the menu switch.  It's very intuitive for Canon users.ONE LITTLE PROBLEM:I bought a book on how to use this camera (Canon EOS Rebel T3i / 600D: From Snapshots to Great Shots, but I didn't read it until AFTER I was flying home on the last day of our two-week vacation.  In the book, I read this (about formatting the memory card):  \"When you purchase any new SD card, you can pop it into your camera and start shooting right away - and probably everything will work as it should.  However, what you *should* do first is format the card in the camera... The card may work in the camera without first being formatted, but chance of failure down the road are much higher.\"When I (who work in the IT industry) read that, I thought to myself, \"Bah!  This guy is wrong.  If it's formatted, it'll work, and if it's not formatted, it won't work.\"Then I got home last night and began transferring ~1400 photos from the camera to my home server.  And to my astonishment, there is one whole day of my family's vacation that is completely missing from the photos!  It's Day Two, when we toured Hoover Dam.  There isn't one dam photo from Day 2 on the SD card!  I have no idea where the dam photos are or what happened to those dam photos!  Weirdly, the photo sequence from Day 3 began at #130, and the end of Day 1 was #129.  I didn't delete or download any dam photos from Day 2, but they're all gone.  Every dam photo from Day Two - gone!So, tonight, I'm going to format the SD card so if I ever return to Hoover Dam, I won't again lose any dam photos that I take.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Item came to my house slightly defective.", "Author": "NewYorker", "ReviewID": "R1CTFQ3SAE0S1F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera in great condition other than a loose shutter release and a battery slot that often doesn't tell the camera that it is closed, which, therefore, does not always turn on.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "After two years, T3i still running like a champ.", "Author": "Kevin B.", "ReviewID": "R2FN90HHQ73FWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never had a single issue with this camera and have just recently expanded out my accessories with a 430EX II flash and a Custom Brackets folding flash mount.

I ended up returning that one because the LCD goes black when turning it 180 deg. after only a  week of shooting and felt discouraged after reading about Nikon customer service rating online. My friend suggested Canon \"easier to learn if you are new to DSLR\" she said.Somehow, after playing with the controls and reading the manual that came with this camera, it made me realized why and how people would use manual, Av, Tv, P mode. (I thought it would be too to complicated and cumbersome to do when I had the Nikon). This camera is very intuitive, you can change desired settings without taking your eyes off your subject. I think it will be easy to always remember how to change the main settings.Now I am excited about learning composition,exposure, etc  and improve my picture taking skills.Btw, had a chance to compare the portrait of my daughter I took with the d5100 (P mode) vs the t3i, this kit lens (18-55) seem to be very sharp, with accurate skin tone. I got worried at first because I think I prefer a softer look of skin tone, like her skin with the d5100 ( like it was airbrush, although it seems to have more red tones from d5100, not sure if I like that).

I'm going to try & be quick about reviewing this camera, but I'm very very excited about this one. I personally think canon did an excellent job in designing this. This is my first SLR camera. I'm use to sony products & don't knock there camera's, & I love their camcorders... but to find an all around camera & camcorder... is unusual. First of all this is a very economical good sized, & comfortable great feeling camera.. very powerful HD 1080p video & picture effects. Very easy to use, can use for a point & shoot right out of box. That's not really why I bought it, I bought this after doing a lot of research 6mths prior to buying. Even though I had in mind what I was going to purchase. I did'nt see or read reviews on this until the end of April 2011. So this had'nt been out much longer than that. This seemed right a way everything I was looking for in a slr camera + more. If you don't no how to use this, as soon as you turn it on there is information on lcd screen which ever dial mode you use right there... so for the beginner this is just great. I already have some knowledge of camera's. The dof on this camera is amazing along with other things you can do to manually control what you're looking to achieve in pictures & movies. I have some very professional depth of field shots off this camera. The t3i came out with the flip out LCD screen in which works great when filming or taking pics high or low from eye level. The camera before this one was the t2i, which did not have the flip out screen. This also has good 3x to 10x zoom you have to set up if you choose to go that route, I use this on occassions, so it's good to know you can do this. You do need extra batteries & lenses that will make this such a professional camera. The battery grip is another option that I personally needed & suggest to add more time to battery life, this doubles a single battery use. I feel this camera is best used in as much manual control as possible, the automatic functions are great... but ( OH ) the depth you can get into using manual control is never ending. I've takin some very breathtaking photo's on some half dead flowers outside my house & this camera made these flowers look so professional, I'm blowing up some of these to 19 by 24 photo's & you would have never known this was takin from half dead flowers... we are going to hang these up on our front entrance way to dining area. There is so much to the canon eos t3i, I can't even attempt to tell how much fun I'm having & purchasing more accessories with it... This was a great choice... Highly Recommend...

Beautiful features!", "Author": "Breakaway720", "ReviewID": "R8QTBMS5KUV37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Canon! I have had a few cameras before this one including a few 14 megapixel cameras and this by far blew them out of the water. The clarity and the range that this camera gave me was like no other camera that I have had before. There are a few reasons that I would equate this camera with the best on the market but I cannot say it in only one sentence so here it goes; the good first, then the bad.PROS:First of all the QUALITY that you get for your money when it comes to Canon products is by far the best deal that you will get when it comes to excellent camera equipment. I bought an SLR from Nikon a few year back thinking that the saving would come in handy. However I did not expect the camera to have so many problems! Automatic focus would never work correctly, the white balance was always atrocious even after I would fix it continuously. It just seems like anything that could go wrong went wrong with that camera. That is why now I SWEAR BY THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF CANON. The last 3 cameras I have owned have been Canon and I willnever go back.Enough with Canon, now this specific camera. The 18.0 MP CMOS sensor was definitely a step up for me. You could see the difference in high-fidelity when it came to the HD images. I was blown away by the processor speed as well. You rarely had to wait more than a few seconds in between shots and the DIGIC lived up to its hype among enthusiasts.The ISO which is denoting the realized speed was AWESOME. Not only was it versatile but the bright to dim modifications that you could change in the setting really set this camera apart in my opinion.This thing is FAST! I love it when electronic equipment can work at the same pace as my brain does, when I am taking pictures the last thing I want to think about is waiting on the camera to finish loading. Not with this. Canon got this right, this could also have a lot to do with the new innovative processor.I had been looking to invest in a camera for a long time. I love taking my camera out at the most inopportune moments and taking pictures of things that no one else would see the art behind. I was really inspired by my sister's camera choice a year back. She chose the Canon EOS but it was a different model then the one here.Another thing that I loved about this camera was the SCREEN SIZE! I love a big screen when I take pictures, it helps me put a scene or object into perspective better in my mind. Don't ask me why or how, it just does. By being able to see the picture that I took on such a large screen, I also can see what I need to improve in the picture and what I need to keep the same.Also, keeping with the screen, the menu options were so simple! I am a guy so the last thing I want to do is open up a manual but this thing to into account people of all skill levels!Speaking of pictures! THIS CAMERA TAKES EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES! Was cap locks necessary? Yes it was. Obviously your thinking, umm, yes of course this camera would take good pictures with the price your paying for it. But as I have looked around online this price point isn't too bad in relation to some other sites online.STARTLING VIDEO QUALITY! Ok I love to talk about this feature of the camera because I love the video camera on this camera. First off, a few weeks back there was an interview with the Japanese CEO of Canon asking him why Canon was seemingly breaking into the video industry when they were already the front-runner in quality when it came to still photography. He said that Canon would like to experiment with adding their quality into the video sector of the industry. Now if I was Sony I would be scrambling to get my cards together because if Canon starts breaking into the video industry you can guarantee that Sony is going to lose a lot of capital with their main competitor increasing their inventory capabilities. When asked if Canon would ever give up its still camera quality to pursue video the CEO said without hesitation that there is no way that Canon would ever stop innovating and improving their cameras. That is there roots and what has made them great and they will never give that up. This is good news for all you purists out there that just want to take beautiful pictures and leave the video to Hollywood and family time.CONS:DSLR's are BIG! Yes, I know, you didn't see that coming did you? Well, it's true and it definitely rears its head when you are at a amusement park or on a long trip and you have to haul your camera around everywhere with you. This isn't such a bad thing when you're going somewhere, like a wedding, to specifically take pictures but it can be definitely a hindrance when you're trying to move fast. If this doesn't bother you then more power to you, it bothers me. However, I knew how big this camera was when I got it and I still got it because the PROS DEFINITELY OUTWAY THE CONS IN MY OPINION. Also, if you have children around then I say BE CAREFUL. My kids almost broke this camera a few times which would have been a horrible thing.  Just make sure if you're going to buy this camera that it fits your lifestyle or you can conform that to fit your camera.The battery life is pretty short on this. I love to take a lot of pictures, upload them online and then edit them or delete depending on how good they are. This battery life was a little hard to do that with because you need to prioritize which pictures you want uploaded before the battery shuts off. This may seem like a pretty bad thing to some but once you have a routine down, like I do now, then it generally gets easier to gauge how much battery life you need to do certain things.These two things are probably the biggest things that I would criticize about this camera. This camera is as close to perfect as its going to get, on a budget, in my opinion.Summary:Life is about give and take and I believe this camera takes the least for your money.  I would love to tell you about every single little detail that I love or hate about this camera but I have told you the most important things in my opinion. Feel free to critique anything I said if you don't agree or post questions in the reply if you want more information, I would love to tell you. I have had this for about 4 months now and I will never go back to a point and shoot, this camera is the real deal and I give it a 5 starts easily.Happy buying!!", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon Beast", "Author": "AzAxeman \"The Tobster\"", "ReviewID": "R2V5NW70P6DW7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have waited years to get a Digital SLR camera and after tons of research I chose the Canon T3i.

I received this camera for Christmas(2012) So currently I've been using it for a good two months. Just comparing this camera to other DSLR's this camera feels very plasticky, and the exterior body will scratch fairly easily, its a tad heavy for how cheap it feels but that could be a good/ bad thing depending on the use.The kit lens (18-55 mm) does a decent job obtaining high resolution images paired with the 18 megapixel sensor.  The swivel screen really isn't a big deal to me and seems more like a gimmick than something people will actually get use out of, since I do not use live view mode very often to frame my shots. Autofocus is horrendous, just warning any first timers out there who are like me and had no clue at the beginning. Using the autofocus in live view mode could possibly be one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced in my life. This is a good camera for still frame/portraits,and not so much action shots just due to the fact the autofocus sucks.The battery life fairs pretty well for what I use it for(trips to the zoo, the occasional landscape shot, and everyday use) and I find myself charging it once every week or so. That being said people who are far more serious than I about their photography will probably need some sort of 3rd party equipment to help extend the battery life during hardcore continuous use.Though with the few gripes I do have about this camera it really has helped me grow and learn as a beginning photographer. The menus are very easy to navigate and I love creative mode because it helps the beginner to get out of auto mode without losing the extra help auto provides. Canon probably has the widest range of lenses available compared to any other brand. Although I have recently gotten my hands on a NIKON D3200 and I have to say I wish I would have started with that and might possibly be ditching my Canon Rebel t3i soon for it. I can't get over how smooth the autofocus on the D3200 is. I mean if both cameras were like food the D3200 would be like butter, smooth and creamy. The t3i would be like vegetable oil greasy but works for everyday use.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "lovin it!!!", "Author": "ligia", "ReviewID": "R32IG05T9E7MFE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was my best buy in a long time.

Every photographer I know and respect has a Canon in their hand so I knew there had to be a reason.Right out of the box, this takes amazing photos! It's done surprisingly well even in low lighting without a flash. I've had very few blurry shots and the few that I did have were when the subject moved abruptly.So far I've just been using the auto settings, but this weekend I plan to read the booklet that came with it and really learn about the manual controls. With that said, if you're a beginner, I think you'll be impressed at how well the auto controls do for every day shooting.The HD video exceeded my expectations. Just know in advance that this is not intended to be a full fledged camcorder. If your video becomes too long, the camera will overheat and it will stop recording. This is what I've read any way. I haven't shot any video longer than a few minutes, so I haven't been able to test this theory. But I do understand I can't expect a DSLR to do what a camcorder does because they don't have the same mechanics. Still this camera is more than sufficient for short video clips and the clarity is very nice. It's much better than carrying around a DSLR and a camcorder on vacation!Just make sure your SDHC card has the number 6 or higher on it. The sales person didn't explain that to me and I got a card with a 4 on it. 4 is too slow for recording HD video. The camera will automatically stop recording after a few seconds.I'm in love with this camera so far and look forward to learning more about its features! The swivel screen is worth the extra money too. It really makes a difference and the colors are very accurate. The screen has a non-glare and smudge resistant finish which helps a lot.As far as construction, the location of the menu button is strange. It's on the left, and as a right handed person, it always feels out of reach. Everything else is being controlled with my right hand and it feels awkward when I have to control the menu with my left.A few people have mentioned the grip of the camera body. I do understand that. When I'm holding it, I always feel like I'm about to drop it. Not sure what to say about that. Just be sure to wear the strap that comes with the camera! :)UPDATE 6/19/12 - I've found the manual focus to be a bit of a pain for video. I am constantly refocusing my subjects and it makes a very loud sound on the video when I do it. This is my first HD camera, so I have no idea if this is common. I did read reviews for other cameras with auto-focus on video and customers often complained that the auto-focus did a poor job and they went back to manual. So I honestly have no idea if auto would be any better. Most people say manual is the way to go.When the subject is in focus, the quality is breathtaking. It's just getting there that seems to be an uphill battle.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible", "Author": "Slick", "ReviewID": "R3MBCUAOLIZ0TQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to write a long winded review, all I will say is that this camera exceeded my expectations.

The included Canon software is fantastic and one does not need to purchase any from another company. Although the kit lens, 18-55mm is adequate, better results will be obtained from optional Canon lenses.I also highly recommend the optional Canon Battery Grip BG-E8. When attached to the bottom of the camera it makes the camera more stable to hold and when two batteries are used, one does not have to worry about running out of battery power during extended shoots.A beginner can leave the camera set on \"automatic\" and let the camera do all the work, however an advanced photographer can use other settings and control the results more to their liking. Although I take mostly still photos, I am impressed with the video results.

A zoom as powerful as the FZ200's has the deeply profound benefit of giving much better control of the content of my pictures, because I can command a far greater range of subjects from any given physical position.Most of my photos are candid pictures of relatives and friends, and for this a powerful zoom is incredibly helpful, especially when it comes with an image stabilizer that effectively counters camera shake so I do not need a tripod.  Obviously  the same applies if you want to photograph birds or flowers or sporting events: you have a much wider operating radius with a lens that goes from very near to very far, and far more opportunities to capture a great picture.The FZ200 comes with a built in Leica lens that zooms from 25mm to 600mm in optical mode.  To put this in context, 50mm is considered a \"normal\" lens, like 20/20 is normal eyesight.  So 600mm is 12 times normal.  So if your friend is 24 feet away, and you shoot at 600mm, it will be as if you were just 2 feet from your friend.The T3i, on the other hand, does not have a built in lens, which has the advantage of allowing the user to buy from a large family of superb Canon lens that screw onto the camera body.  However, to get the same amount of range from the T3i, 25mm to 600mm, you would have to buy at least three lenses, and would have the hassle of changing lens whenever you wanted to go from one zoom level to the next, and the further hassle of toting them with you.Looking at 4\"x6\" pictures of the same object with the same lighting at the same distance from the same position, shooting in automatic mode,  I do not see any difference between the FZ200 and T3i.  Possibly a close examination would show that the T3i takes marginally better pictures, but for my purposes the FZ200 pictures are plenty good enough.In some areas the T3i and FZ200 are about the same.They both have a lovely flip out rotating LCD, that lets you hold the camera to anywhere your arms can stretch and your eyes can see, so you can shoot above the heads of the crowd, or situate the camera at floor level, or even take a high quality selfie.Both can function as good quality video cameras, and use SDHC cards capable of storing hours of video.In some areas, the T3i is definitely a better camera.  In manual mode, I found the FZ200 harder to use. But in automatic mode, the FZ200 produces consistently good pictures, and has very fast autofocus.In general, the T3i is a  great camera with a large user base and many accessories.  It is certainly closer to being a professional level camera than the FZ200.But overall, if told I could pack only one camera for a vacation, it would be the FZ200 and not the T3i.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Canon T3i is a good start!", "Author": "Max E. Scott", "ReviewID": "R26HKBDQE86IB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon Rebel T3i was purchased as a primary camera, the major reason was price and articulating monitor was the secondary reason.  As an older amateur photographer those ground level shots presented somewhat of a challenge, hopefully the monitor will mitigate that issue.  Preliminary use in bright sun was not encouraging though as the monitor was hard to see when it was folded out.  There are still several vantage points to be pursued. This camera has all of the considerations one might look for in a good DSLR starter!  One might ask why after having owned the T2i would one not go on to a 7D kit package and that would be a good question.  Most, if not all of the Canon references (along with Nikon) suggest putting money into the best lens available rather then a camera for the time being.  The original camera came as a kit with two lens, a 18-70mm and a 70-300mm.  Both lens will work with any of the upper grade crop cameras as well as any additions to the \"tool box\" along the way.  I suspect the T3i will meet all current expectations and will update this review sometime after summer 2014.  If you are a beginning photographer you will want to consider this camera.

Also the lens barrel moves nice and smooth, maybe a bit too smooth. The lens can't hold it's self if it's held down (also does a bit when tilted)unless you're holding it, for example if you were to place the camera on a tripod to photograph something at 50mm from a direct top view, it will go from 50mm to 135mm. I find it really annoying especially with long exposures.So basically it's a really nice camera for those who are new to photography and for those who are deeper into photography should just buy the body and lens separate, in my opinion", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does just what you want it to do.", "Author": "Cams", "ReviewID": "R2DSG2ZIEPYZLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a camera expert ,but this camera has served me well for over a year now with no problem.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Celeste Soma", "ReviewID": "R33ZUQOH54L4GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the camera....It arrived quickly , the only thing that I was unhappy about is the packaging, it should have been padded better...", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Hibah Alsulami", "ReviewID": "R101K5J8C1GACO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect camera for me as a beginner.

It's sturdy, photos come out real sharp and it's very easy to use.I used my dad's Canon AE-1 for many years and I chose this one over the Nikon D3200 for the price. I also got the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Tele, all for $600. (I don't have preference over either brand)The 18-55 is ok. Rather fragile. You don't want to be switching glass too much when outdoor, the lens is very light and it's pretty much made of plastic, so be careful; it is a ''kit lens'' after all. It does take sharp photos but AF is rather slow. Wanna shoot a fast subject? Use manual focus.The camera gets slow at times when shooting in continuous mode, but at nearly $500, 3.7fps it's all you're gonna get.I'm very happy with it.

The quality of the pictures is excellent. Even now that I've bought two other lenses, I still go back and use the kit lens as well which attests to its quality. About the only downside to this camera is that it isn't a full-frame sensor camera, but it's not the fault of the camera; hence, I'm not docking any stars for it.Its low-light performance is very good. Paired with my 50mm f1.4 lens, this camera is simply stunning. But is where the downside kind of comes around. Because of the cropped sensor, you actually get a closer image than 50mm. (Multiplied by approx. 1.6) So it's slightly zoomed in. That said, though, it's an unstoppable camera. It feels nice and weighty, and after one day of using, you'll find all the buttons are intelligently arranged for easy access.This camera is simply unbeatable. If only because all cameras from various companies in this range perform basically the same. It's all a matter of personal preference for ergonomics, really and some near-negligible differences.I wholly recommend this camera to anyone willing to dive into the SLR realm. Just be aware: If you plan on upgrading to a full-frame sensor Canon camera, some of the lenses will not be compatible. I.E. the EF-S lenses will not be. Easily distinguishable by the white square as the lining mark on the lens, vice the red circle. So if you ever plan on upgrading, I would recommend getting EF (red circle) lenses as you collect more. Just be aware that until you upgrade your camera, your focal lengths are multiplied by 1.6 for this camera on all EF lenses.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon t3i exactly what i expected!", "Author": "Mac Daniel Dimla", "ReviewID": "R35PA55F7LR3O8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got exactly what I bought!

The first digital camera I own was a Canon Powershot SD 1000, I purchased it back in 2007, and continued to use it until it was damaged, in 2010. Even though it only had 7.1 megapixels, I was extremely happy with the all-around quality. Imagine my surprise when I went purchase another one and discovered that the standard cameras were now double those megapixels? I again, purchased a Canon Powershot with 14.1 MPs, and was amazed at the picture quality, even now. The romance was short lived though, later that summer I fell into a river and it ruined the camera... it upset me greatly.A few months later, I returned to purchase another camera, I noticed the Sony Cyber-shot also had 14.1 megapixels, but also had a panorama feature and a touch screen. Now the touch screen was not as much of a draw, as was the panoramic panning mode. Living about an hour from the Olympic Peninsula, the Cascade Mountain range (Mt. Rainier), a few hours from Mt. St. Helens, I figured I could make great use of this feature. 14 MP's is 14 MP's regardless of brand... right? I was horribly mistaken, and very disappointed with my Sony Cyber-shot, to the point I didn't even bother to take it back-packing with me on many occasions. My mothers Canon Powershot with 10 MP's took better pictures than my Sony.My father and I have an annual summer back-packing trip in late summer, usually. I decided I wouldn't take my camera with me, because I didn't want him bothering me to take a picture every 5 steps, so he took his own. Upon our return, I downloaded the pictures promptly, but neglected to look at them till around December, and I was outraged. Not only was almost every picture blurred, but many of them were crooked! Upon seeing this atrocity, I vowed I would never let my father be the hiking-historian.After one unusually large pay-check, I went against my better judgement of saving the money, and dropped it all on the T3i. Hey, I live in an incredibly scenic area, I figured the expense was justified. I have never been happier with a camera. The all around sharpness of the image, coupled with the fairly, reasonable price, left me very happy. Probably the best money I've spent in a very long time, certainly the best money I've spent on a camera.

Suffice for me to say is - it is awesome! I have had 2 previous Rebel models and I thought they were brilliant. But this new model surpasses them 10-fold. I know this isn't the most up to date model currently available as the T4i is available. But to be honest I did look at the 2 models together and I decided for what I will use the camera for, I couldn't justify the relatively small increase in cost. I have only had the camera a few days so I am not able give report on every aspect of the camera yet. However a few of the things I like most about this camera are:The Screen. It is so helpful to be able to pull it out and adjust it to take low/high level photos, or simply to turn the screen around so as to have the screen facing you as you take photos. Also I've used it in bright, sunny weather and it can be viewed in all conditions. I also love the size of the screen, giving the photographer a good image of the photo he/she has just taken. Or for reading the settings.Operating. I feel this model is so easy to quickly change the various settings - ISO, Shutter Speeds, Aperture and so forth. Most settings are done at a press of a button and by choosing the appropriate setting on the dial, there are no complicated menus to navigate through.It feels like a quality camera. It is Lightweight and feels really good in the hands.Video. Initially I must admit I didn't care too much for the video aspect as I only wanted a still camera. However I love the short video bursts of several seconds allowing you to stop it frame by frame and select the best photo from the video. I think this is something that I will use frequently.These are just a handful of the things I love about this camera, there are many more.

I don't normally post a review when I feel like I have nothing new to add to what others have already said about this camera. It is a great digital SLR for a first time owner of an SLR. There are other great camera manufacturers like Nikon. But if you are considering a Canon brand camera and have no experience using this kind of camera, you should not hesitate to purchase this camera. I have been using the camera for a couple of months and I have not found any part of the design to be lacking or difficult to use.This is my second SLR camera and my first digital SLR. My first SLR was a Minolta X-700 I owned during the 1980's. I liked that camera but found it very tedious manually adjusting the shutter and aperture for every shot plus getting it in focus.  I have owned several fixed lens digital cameras and again didn't like messing with settings and didn't even attempt to change the color balance while indoors because it was not very intuitive to understand without reading the manual.  So I expected that when I started using this camera I feel the same way.This camera is very easy to work with. It is much easier to set up manually than the analog camera or any of the fixed lens digital cameras I have owned. the layout of the buttons and other controls are easy to find.  There isn't a lot of digging through menus to change settings.  All the important settings are activated by a control on the camera, usually on the right hand side of the body. Setting of the shutter and aperture is easy to do and the focus is automatic. I don't mind setting them like I did before.In some ways I feel bad to see real film SLR cameras disappear, but this digital camera has so much more and you don't have to wait for the film to be developed.

Pretty quick and accurate autofocus, much too loud though if you plan on using autofocus for shooting video without doing ADR.Cons:1.

It was easy to use, it had fully auto settings, and also has an array of auto settings which allow creative shooting, along with a fully manual mode to use as you please. I ordered the camera in December of 2012 and used it through the year, relatively sporadically. It takes great photos and it is a very good quality camera. I would recommend the T3i (as this one is) over the T3, as the T3 is only 12 MP, and the T3i is 18 MP, which is much better in terms of digital performance.  So all good up till now...HOWEVER...I took the camera with me to my Florida home for Christmas this year, and noticed that the lens would not auto focus. It then would not shoot. I took it off, cleaned it, tried to get it to work, and no luck. I then took it to a camera store and the clerk told me the lens (which comes with the camera) was shot. It was under a year old, and I take very good care of my equipment. So it mystified me as to why this would have happened. Then, I reread the warranty and saw that the whole thing is warranted for one year. By the time I had done this, I was already a few days over and I had no choice but to order another lens for $200 so I could shoot pictures at Christmas. My daughter has the same camera and has had no trouble, but I have to say this was a black mark for me on this Canon camera. Other than the lens issue, the camera takes great photos, and is a great camera for those uninitiated in photography, as it has fully auto functions which allow good pictures anytime. I am just sorry that this lens issue popped up for me, because I was thoroughly impressed with the camera until this happened.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Boris", "ReviewID": "RGVT0GOXALWWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since the DSLR cameras have came out I've wanted one.

For me, it's reletively small size, it's articulating screen, it's high image quality and the ease of use with all the setting made it a perfect choice. I can manipulate all the controls I might immediately need, like ISO, focus points, aperture and shutter speed.I've not used it for any kind of videography(yet), however Canon has made the T3i into a superior camera to start with. Much of the settings for filming are up to you, and there are a plethora of choices to make, such as your live focusing preference, white balance, resolution and frames per second and so on. This camera is also equipped to use exterior microphones like shotgun mics, lapel mics and boom mics. A lot of sound recording equipment for the T3i is available here on Amazon or elsewhere.With the kind of overall rating the Canon Rebel T3i has, I'd pretty much disregard the naysayer reviews. In every manufacturing process there's going to be a few duds out of the tens of thousands in a production run.Grab this camera and a couple of lenses and go have some fun!", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome entry-lever dSLR camera!", "Author": "Esteban", "ReviewID": "R2JEXAM894VLPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took it off the box and start shooting on Manual setting AWESOME pictures. I dont have much idea about dSLR camera or photography besides the pics I take with my iPhone 5 so I need to research a bit more but besides that, even a beginner can take awesome photos without much effort, I guess the best thing to improve is shoot shoot and shoot some more.

The price of Canon's dSLRs came down considerably over the holidays, so I had to spring for it. Out of the box (once you buy a memory card, not included), you can make photography nuts cringe by setting it to auto-focus and automatic picture mode and just shoot away. There is no need to have any photography skills at all to use this camera. Compared to other \"high quality\" cameras I've used for about half the price, the picture quality is outstanding. Don't worry about any negative comments from people demanding professional quality from a budget dSLR - they just need to save their pennies and buy something designed for professionals if they want to get picky about taking a crisp photo in the dark with no flash. For the rest of us, this camera fills the need for great quality with no learning curve. Of course, as you get the opportunity to play around with more features, you can learn how to take even more outstanding photos too. The 18-55mm kit lens works fine, and was only a few pennies more than the \"body only\" version, so you might at well start with that and worry about potentially adding additional lenses later.

My only advice on this camera is to make sure your sd card can handle the amount of data this camera needs to send.

I purchased the body only - I have several lenses from my previous Canons which are NOT currently 'IS' lenses. I've been shooting people, places and other things for more than 45 years and LOVE this camera. It's extremely mobile. I can just flip open my tripod lock and GO! My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE (as I've found so far). As soon as you move up to manual for full control, you lose the grid (I use the 3x3), which helps me set my composition. Yes, I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder, but WHY when one is readily available.With my additions on the camera already, video/image reviews will be plentiful. As I learn new tricks and shortcuts, I'll inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasn't necessary, yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. I'll be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months, as well as trying out the 'IS' lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced (and WAY higher priced), big brothers to this camera. Now, the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW! The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out, are bored with the out of date \"point-n-shoot,\" want to upgrade your digital cams, or you want to move from film to digital, the T3i will not disappoint. It's an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro, this camera really shines.

Get one for yourself, and you will, too!", "Author": "Goodeknight", "ReviewID": "RCR0JYDP4WM5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE the T3i. With 18 megapixels, full HD video, and the Canon name, it'll still be high tech in 10 years +. The two main upgrades from the T3 are 12.2 vs. 18 megapixels, and the fact that the T3i has an articulated screen. And you WILL use the articulated screen often -- for overhead shots, low angle shots, self portraits, setting up tripod based video/still shots (flip the screen around so you can see your shot as you tweak backgrounds).Bought mine as a package deal from Cardinal Camera (best prices ANYWHERE).  Skip the package with the 75-300mm zoom.  Get the package with the 55-250mm IS zoom.  (more below on that)The two main T3i upgrade points (megapixels and articulated screen) do make it cost a good bit more than the T3, but the upgrades are well worth it. As for the 75-300 vs 55-250 IS lens -- IS is the key - image stabilization. A friend of mine with the 75-300 lens said, \"It's practically worthless. I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks. I hate that lens.\" Without IS, you're doomed unless it's a cloudless day at high noon, or you're carrying a tripod around with you, or you're zoomed out to less than 150mm or so. I don't recall the exact numbers, but I believe IS gives you something like 4 additional stops before your shots get blurry. That's major, and again, well worth the extra money.  And with the 55-250 IS lens, you won't miss the 50mm difference.  In fact, if you want to zoom in that much, you'd be better off blowing up your pic taken with the IS lens.  It'll still be sharper than a pic with at 300mm zoom.After an exhaustive search, I found Cardinal Camera had the best deal on a T3i package. In fact, best deals anywhere on the T3i and a number of other cameras I was considering. Came quickly in a carefully packed box. Lots of goodies, though I will probably get some higher quality uv filters to protect my lenses - filters with multilayer coating to reduce glare. If you want to carry the goodies around, they practically fill the included bag. Not enough room for all of it, plus the camera.Next time I'm in the market for photography supplies, Cardinal Camera will be my first stop. I don't know when that will be though. I'm perfectly happy with my T3i. Like it a whole lot better than I would a T3 or anything similar, and I didn't see a need to go way up in price to a T4i.If you're still on the fence about spending a big chunk of change on a camera, just go for it. This camera isn't a piece of technology. It's a stack of priceless photo albums. It's vacation pictures worthy of framing. It's family portraits. It's memories.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "lg", "ReviewID": "R1Z92JRZX2A6L9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, good price, and it takes great pictures.

Its not worth getting a DSLR in general if your just going to keep it on auto-shot and really you don't get much from the camera if you do so, especially considering how large it is. If your just looking for better image quality I'd say go for a mirrorless interchangeable lens or \"compact system\" camera (as they call it on amazon)but if your willing to learn ( or through trial and error) you can get stunning and beautiful shots in conditions you never thought possible, I have really been breath taken by some of the photos as they appear for the first time on my computer monitor, then my jaw really dropped again when I started shooting in RAW format and editing in photoshop, but again, you have to be willing to tinker with settings/modes and eventually lenses, but once you do so you'll never want to go back.  Well now that your looking at entering the field of semipro/ enthusiasts photography this is one of, if not, the best entry cameras you can get. The camera delivers in almost every front, in terms of image quality, options, versatility, and only falls slightly short on its continuous shooting rate, as well as the auto focus can and will fail in low light and tricky conditions, this can simply be overridden by manual focus which isn't difficult once you get the hang of it. If you can afford it, get a new lens, the lens this comes paired with is decent but the auto focus is slow. Cannon (as well as 3rd party companies like sigma) have a huge range of great lenses and while lenses are expensive, keep in mind they will last a lot longer then the camera itself. Moving on, the flip screen is very useful for low/ high angles and I've taken some interesting backwards shots. In terms of video, the built in microphone is good for what it is, but if your a little serious, you want to grab and external mic, which it does have support for. Now the only tricky thing in video is that it does not have continuous autofocus, so time to beef up that manual focus skill. It has a HDMI out, so you can view directly on your TV, and the neat software by cannon allows you to view and control your camera through your computer when its hooked via USB. The battery lasts for ages and can be swapped out, the flash provided is fine but is rarely used as it makes most situations harsh without the ability to control the strength like an attached flash does/some DSLRs(it does have a standard mount. finally I wish this camera had GPS for geotaging pictures, not essential but would be nice.In Review, this is a great camera, and will get you very far in photography, with few limitations except your own knowledge and imagination.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lovely.", "Author": "Rachael R.

Yes, it is a crop sensor so you won't get full frame out of your lens, but overall it's an amazing camera. Just beware, once you start shooting, you'll get addicted and it's an expensive hobby. Although the auto modes are good in a snap, some of my best pictures have come from fiddling around in the manual mode which you just can't beat! If you want to delve into videography, this is an awesome camera as well and can get you that filmic look that you want. I won't profess to be an expert at the t3i (I'm still learning stuff everyday), but the features are intuitive and it's a great camera! BUY IT! There are a few features that really stand out in my mind:- Swivel LCD screen - This is not cheaply made, it's got a nice sturdy feel to it and can be switched into a variety of angles to help you get that perfect shot!- Kit Lens - I've tried the 50mm 1.8, but the kit lens is pretty sweet too. You've got to really have ideal settings to get good footage, but it helps you learn how to use a DSLR- Video mode - It's pretty intuitive and takes great HQ video! I'm impressed!- The camera itself has a nice weight to it! It doesn't feel cheap or fragile (I wouldn't drop it of course).I haven't had the camera long enough and I don't know enough about photography to figure out any of the cons of the camera, but I've got to say, I'm more impressed than I ever thought I'd be.

It is also pretty much and lightweight.The best part would have to be the wide selection of lens that Canon has to offer.We also make short wedding trailers with these cameras and the video quality is superb.  You get to shoot in full HD 1080p!For the price that these DSLR cameras are today, you can't go wrong buying one.  I do suggest buying a battery pack and a flash.  These high res videos and pictures will take a toll on the battery.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good purchase", "Author": "CL`", "ReviewID": "R3NE3GGQY1R5BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little worried to buy something this expensive in the internet but the product came out intact and very well protected.

I did some research before I got this SLR.I compared Canon T3i with Nikon D5100 and D5200. I also compared T2i, T3 and T4i. I found the T3i is the best. You'd better not focus on the pixel. Pixel means nothing. Especially for the new SLR users and the basic SLRs camera. 18MP is much enough for new user like me. Although many people said T3i didn't have many updates from T2i. But I saw many photos from the Flickr which were taken by the T3i. I think the price is nice. I got this camera with the basic lens, 50mm-250mm lens, 16GB Class 10 SD card and an amazon brand camera bag for $690. What a amazing price is.

Shoots 1080P.", "Author": "Nuknuk", "ReviewID": "RZC5DT7BTMF0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur photographer who loves to shoot videos and photos of my family. Although I am also hankering to own a full frame camera, someday, at the moment this is what I can afford. I bought this Canon T3i to replace my old Rebel.  I love to shoot video and I wanted to upgrade to 1080P.  I also used to lug both a video and a still camera, now I don't have to.  I don't have to buy new lenses as the 3 lenses I have for the old Rebel are compatible in size.So far I have shot hundreds of videos and thousansd of stills.  I have brought it everywhere from parades, to beaches in Delaware and California, to Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Shenandoah mountains and to Florida. I usually just bring a monopod for better portability.  I shot indoor videos and stills, in particular, with my daughter's ballet recitals and my kids' school concerts an plays.  Using a long zoom (not with the expensive fast lenses but decent), a monopod and setting it to 1600 ISO, I can shoot hundreds of pictures and get more than a handful of great photos.To shoot videos it is recommended to use faster SD cards.  I am using 16g Transcends class 10 SD cards.  The price of memory cards have fallen so much that I could afford to buy several of them - just under $13 for the class 10 Transcends at the time of this review.  There are a few times when the video recording stops automatically after a few seconds, but usually that is when I  have used the card so many times (record, delete, record, ...etc), I just defragment that SD card and the problem stops.I uses iMovie to process my video clips.  The Canon video format import very easily.Overall, it is an excellent camera to shoot family stills and videos to preserve and record lasting memories.  The size is just right for me, it's not as big and heavy as a full frame camera.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "love my new camera", "Author": "JEANIE Puckett", "ReviewID": "RJTTS1B2AJ751", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "love my new camera.it was just what I wanted.Thank you very much for the fast shipment.

The arguments that the picture quality is not good enough to justify the price increase from your run of the mill 180$ camera are easily squashed when you see what this camera can do.  It takes a bit of reading on the functionality of the camera before you can really get the best of it, but simply on the preset and automatic settings you can tell the difference.  The camera consistently gives great pictures and for a mid range DSLR camera I would defiantly recommend it.  A sturdy or manageable case is recommended as the size of cameras like this makes it more likely to be damaged if you are just carrying it around unprotected.

The colors really pop and the ISO levels are pretty sturdy until you get way too high. If you know how to use it (or learn how to use it, there are great websites out there)There are a couple of things that might be a problem, but if you are aware of them I can't imagine them being an issue. Firstly, it doesn't output to a monitor in full HD, so you're better of getting a cheap lcd viewfinder or magnifier to see more details. Second, It will only record clips that are 12 minutes in length, which really shouldn't be a problem unless you're trying to remake Touch of Evil. Lastly, the camera did start to overheat and shut down on me once, but it was out in the sun all day and I did get a warning on the screen. The camera worked fine after a little rest, however.So don't do super long takes, don't leave it in the sun, and don't use a monitor, and this baby is good to go.

I am a tall guy (6'3\") and the swivel screen is perfect for positioning the camera down and around in positions to get the best shot. Also, im paranoid about scratches on it so it is great to swivel it and snap in inwards to protect the screen.The picture quality is amazing. The pictures i got on the \"no flash\" setting at sunset and nighttime in downtown Frankfurt will probably stick with me forever. The video is also rather easy to use and provides some good quality. Just need to focus as you go at times. I am a novice to put it lightly when it comes to photography so have not really tried too much with the more manual settings on the camera, but for all you novices out there looking for a quality dSLR to start out I would recommend this camera.

I previously owned a 40D and was very happy with it. There were some back focusing issues but Canon had recalibrated it and it was working great. One day, though, when I was trying to photograph a painting with some very saturated reds, I noticed the camera just couldn't handle this spectrum of colors--they were strangely murky and smeared looking, lacking crisp details. I wondered if perhaps some of the newer cameras could handle reds better.I then looked at the review for the T3i on dpreview. They test all their reviewed cameras at varying ISO's with an elaborate studio still life; the results can be seen at the end of each review on a page called \"Studio scene comparison (RAW)\". You can view the images at full resolution and compare sections shot with many different cameras. There are several small bright red fuzzy balls in the still life that are excellent measures for red. I noticed with interest that most cameras (including the 1D!) did not capture the reds well--they had the same murkiness that I noticed with my 40D. There were, however, a few notable exceptions, including Canon's T3i, 60D and 5D Mark II; and Nikon's D3. The red fuzzy balls shot with these had well-defined, clear details, without the problems other cameras suffered from. The 60D, unfortunately, had an orange cast in its reds, leaving the T3i the undisputed winner among lower priced models. Please note: most reviews claim that all the Canon 18 mp cameras have the same sensor--this comparison seems to indicate that they have redesigned or tweaked it for these most recent models.I purchased the T3i and, because of past problems, carefully tested its focusing accuracy. I ended up exchanging the first one because it seemed a bit sluggish, although it was accurate. This was a big mistake! The second one was accurate in the outside points, but back focused in the center point. I exchanged this one and ended up with one that had an accurate center point but back focused with the outside points! This is a fairly minor problem--it's off by about 1/8\". Targeted details are on the edge of the zone of sharpness rather than the center, and it's only noticeable in critical close-up shots with the aperture wide open. Still, it could be a problem for portrait and macro shots. I kept it but may send it in to be calibrated.Aside from this, it's a great camera. Beautiful, detailed images, great dynamic range, and the extra resolution gives me room to crop. The high ISO image quality is infinitely superior to the 40D.I also enjoy playing with the video function, with one disappointment: the digital zoom starts at a 3X magnification and goes up to 10X. That means you cannot shoot without any magnification when the camera is switched to digital zoom, a limitation which demands considerable room to back up from your subject. I don't know why Canon designed the zoom like this; it renders a potentially wonderful feature almost useless in an average indoor setting.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel", "Author": "njparent", "ReviewID": "RXLXFNYBYZUW4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent Camera, great to hold in hand and handle.

I had a chance to try 60D before and I can say that image quality of the picture taken by these two cameras are almost same. If you support with good lenses, you can have high quality images with T3i body. - The movable LCD screen is far my favorite. It gives a pleasure when you use the camera.

Pity there aren't enough lenses for it but that could change soon.The Canon T3i comes with the best lens in the market, far better than the D5100 kit lens. The Nikon kit lens is a soft lens, the Canon kit lens is ultra-sharp and it has a greater depth of field. Also Canon lenses are cheaper.Color reproduction is noticeably better on the T3i. The Nikon camera lacks saturation, specially in the red spectrum. Sunsets look completely wrong on the Nikon, dull and grey instead of yellow and red. However the Nikon D5100 performance in ultra low-light conditions is spectacular, the D5100 noise reduction is impeccable and beats the Canon Rebel by a long shot. This make the Nikon a better choice if you plan to use super-telephotos or shoot at night.The T3i photos look amazing as long as you keep your exposures between ISO 100-800 but the Canon T3i responds poorly at ISO 6400, no just noise but white \"hot pixels\" ruin the image. Photoshop filters can remove some of the noise but are unable to remove the white pixels successfully and who wants to work that hard anyhow? For this reason I cannot recommend this camera for low-light shooting such as wedding photography (ie. inside a church)Warning to filmmakers: It is not impossible to shoot a movie with the Rebel T3i but it is extremely impractical and I question the sanity of people who would recommend DSLR cameras for movie production. You would be just asking for trouble. Instead, if you must shoot HD video with a still camera for some reason, just buy a Sony TX9 or TX10 for one third of the price, the 1080p video quality is the same and it offers continuous autofocus, oh, and it fits in your pocket, perfect for traveling.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lack of autofocus for video", "Author": "Anet", "ReviewID": "R2JT8A8O9XFFRE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for taking pictures.

Anyway...I have had this camera for about a week now and have taken a few thousand shots. I am absolutely blown away by the quality. After using the T3i, I feel like I have never actually owned a camera- all my previous cameras seem like useless toys. The control and ability that this camera gives you allow you to really take your pictures to the next level. I took outdoor action shots of my dog that I wouldn't even have attempted in the past. The colors that popped in my outdoor shots really captured my neighborhood in spring bloom. One somewhat unpleasant surprise is just how much detail was picked up- skin blemishes and dust in my house were all very visible! This camera will allow you to capture moments that you can frame on your wall forever, as opposed to the typical posed portraits that you are generally limted by with point and shoots.I upgraded to the 18-135mm lens, and it takes great shots and never requires you to dance around getting closer to a subject. The lens feels solid, and is not excessively large. I live on a bay, and was able to get nice shots of boats 1/4 -1/2 mile away without a problem. I also picked up the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens for indoor photography.

This is my first digital SLR as I finally joined the digital club when the my 35MM SLR finally broke (yeah, I'm a bit late). I've used numerous canon products before (Elan, Rebel, SX110, 120), So I'm kinda familar with SLR and digital functions. I decided on the rebel series as a point of entry to the DSLR world due to the price to function ratio being extremely attractive. I needed a full function of an SLR that allows me to attach a long telephoto lense (Sigma 120-400mm - see my other review on this lense) for wildlife. My expectation was in the mid range due to the canon namesake and various functionality (3.7fps, B&W;, HD movies and tilting LCD) and compatibility with my older stuff from flim days (70-210 mm and 380EX flash - TTL even works too!).I'm goign to pass on the pros and cons for this camera since most of them has been discussed thoroughly by other reviewers. However, the biggest suprise for me is how robust the camera body is. My camera fell off my backpack while I was galloping on horseback in the mountains of Ecuador and subsequently and after careful inspection, I found that the camera remains fully functional with only cosmetics issues. When it happened I thought that I need to purchase another camera for the rest of my trip as I was quite convience that the fall would have shattered my camera. Just FYI, I was not galloping at full speed and it was on dirt trail, but still I am very impressed by how solid the camera was build to sustain such impact. On the disappointing side, at higher end of the ISO, the performance of the camera definitely is not as good as those higher end like the 6D and up.Bottomline : I would recommend this camera to those who wish to venture into DSLR as price point to performance is very attractive, especially now with newer models of rebels. Also, works with your older equipment from your flim days (if any of you guys are still around).

I've also tested near and far photo shots, with hand held and tripod mounts. I've included filters and telephotos as well. I have not played with any wide angle lenses yet.LENSES USED:  Canon 18-55mm (Image Stabilization)  Canon 75-300mm (Non-Image Stabilization)  Sigma 18-250 Macro (Image stabilization)  Sigma APO 2x DG EX teleconverter  Vivitar UV filters  Precision Design 2x telephoto  Precision Design wide angle 0.45xPHOTO QUALITY:-T3I camera takes nice photos, but while holding camera by hand, there are some hits and misses of blurred images when subjects move. I have tried different settings including the sports setting. I assume this is due to my not getting used to the camera settings yet? When images don't blur, pictures are awesome.-Another of my cameras, point-and-shoot Canon SX260, takes better pictures than the T3I. I set both cameras on the same tripod and take photos of the same objects in daylight, then with multiple other objects at different locations. Different zoom ranges used for each camera. SX260 takes better photos when viewed at same size using Windows Live Photo Gallery. Possibly me not knowing settings on T3I again? Please note SX260 is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras out there.PHOTOGRAPHER'S VIEWPOINT WHILE TAKING PHOTOS:-With many of my point-and-shoot cameras including the Canon SX130IS, when I manually change the exposure (such as trying to lighten a person's face to show in a really bright background) the screen shows the face darker or lighter, and the photos come out lighter or darker accordingly. If I can see the person's face on the screen, I can see the person's face in the photo. With the T3i, the screen doesn't reflect this. I may be able to see the person's face on the screen, but the photo actually comes out too dark or too light depending on how I manually \"guessed\" at the exposure. It amazes me how a DSLR is inferior to multiple cheapy point-and-shoot cameras. Sure, I can take multiple photos to see which is best (but only in a perfect world will all things stand still for me).VIDEO QUALITY:T3I is my only camera ever with absolutely worthless videos. All my point-and-shoots work fine in video. When subjects move closer or farther from the camera, everything is out of focus except for when the subject coincidentally is in that specific focal point. I have played around with the settings. The best I can do is use the shutter button to reset to a new focal point when the subject moves. Even then, the camera takes a while to lock in to the new focal point, by which time the subject has then moved once more. Perhaps videos might work properly if all subjects stay at infinity focal point eventhough they move? The manual confirms camera is not capable of keeping subject in focus if subject moves.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera...

If you are looking to take rapid pics, this is not your camera.  This is my first DSLR and even I thought it was slow.  After doing more research I found out that if I paid $40 more, I could get the T4.  Why wouldn't I do that?  The T4 is faster, it has more MPs, it has a touch screen, and it can hold two memory cards.  It has in camera HDR and video autofocus.  Now when it originally came out the price was much higher and the T3 was a better bang for your buck, but ever since the price of the T4 came down, it makes no sense to to get the T3.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE MY REBEL T3i!!!", "Author": "Miss Linda", "ReviewID": "R2QG3A2DC89HLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I asked some friends who always take beautiful pictures what kind of camera they have--and this is the camera they named.

My T3i camera will occasionally take pictures with compression lines running vertically through the picture.  This is about 1 in 10 pictures.  It is sort of like looking through wavy privacy glass.  I have lost critical wedding photos to this.So far over the course of 3 weeks trying to get a repair from the manufacturer Canon has blamed my laptop card reader, my workstation usb port, Windows 7 picture importer, Picasa picture importer, Lightroom picture importer, my class 10 SD card, my new class 10 SD card, My very newest professional 35mb/s SD card, and low batteries.  I have been run through multiple camera resets and I have actually been hung up on.  I have always been calm and professional when talking to support on the phone.Finally after multiple calls to Canon support they agreed to check the camera.  Now I have to ship it to Canons repair center paying for shipping and they will be keeping my camera for 10 business days for in house repair plus shipping times both ways.  There is no guarantee of fixing the problem or of swapping out my camera.  They actually stated on the phone that the 10 days could be longer as it is a busy time for them.  I am waiting to send it to them after years end as I do not want to be without a camera during Christmas two of my children's birthdays and New Year's. 1 in 10 bad photos is better than zero photos.  Canon will not advance replace cameras.I think if I had received a fully working camera this would be a 5 star review.  Instead I have to work with very poor customer support for a fairly expensive purchase.  I deal with Dell, HP, Microsoft and Cisco customer support at my work every day and Canon has by far the worst support or warranty I have had to deal with in recent memory.Hopefully your purchase will not need the support or warranty and you can simply enjoy a good product.

I tested both cameras under identical situations and was quite disappointed in the quality of the photos even with out a lot of magnification. The 300 lens was even more of a disappointment and I received sharper and clearer photos with my old Panasonic. The body of this camera is smaller than I am used to and more difficult to hold comfortably. I was also interested in the video capabilities as the Panasonic is lacking quality in this area. I did not even test the video as the other areas fell much too short to bother.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3LXM96AY4J45Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The zoom is great, the settings are amazing , the megapixels are phonomomal and the Video is insane ..

Mamaradlo", "ReviewID": "RHHGVU9D7AKOT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm sure you bought this DSLR for the video capture feature, and that's fine.  However, at best this camera is a B-Camera.  It will not replace your camcorder due to the fact that it does not auto focus while recording.  In the manual, it does show you that you can AF while recording, but you constantly have to press the shutter button halfway.  One of the bad side effects is that refocusing is slow.  The AF speed isn't as lightning fast as if you're in Photo mode.  By the way, the AF is snappy quick when you're doing still shots.  So while you video record and press the shutter button to refocus, the camera CAN take 1-2 seconds until focus confirmation is achieved (HD video focus set to \"AF-Quick\" for those wondering about my settings).  This has been my experience with my Canon 17-40mm f4 L lens.  Another bad side effect (and the manual mentions it) is that if you are video recording and you press the shutter button to refocus, your video's Exposure changes.  Let's say it took 1.5 second to refocus, your recorded video will have sudden dark and bright scenes in that 1.5 second.  IT IS NOTICEABLE and VERY DISTRACTING.  I need to do more test to see if I can eliminate that.  The manual does not recommend this style of refocusing and to just do a manual refocus by hand using the lens's focus ring.Another thing I hate about this camera when video recording is that it will NOT let you select a slower shutter speed below 1/30 sec.  I own a Panasonic AG-HMC40 3CCD camcorder, and I can adjust the shutter/Aperture independently.  I can shoot at 1/12 sec at 24p.  But with this camera, I can't go lower than 1/30 sec if I shoot at either 30P or 24P.  At 60P, you can't go lower that 1/60 sec.  This was something I was not aware of prior to purchasing this camera.  Others will say, why would you want to shoot at a low shutter speed?  Well you can do strobe effects, or more importantly, the lower the shutter speed, the more light you can get.  Sometimes I use 1/12 sec for static night shots.EDIT -- I just realized that I can get better video footage under dark lighting when the \"Movie Exposure\" is set to AUTO.  I've had it set to Manual.  This is counter-intuitive to what I've been used to for my camcorder.Another thing I hate about this camera is the 12 minute time limit of HD recording!!!  From my test, the camera will STOP recording after 12mins.  I am recording with a 16GB SDHC card.  The user manual mentions it and is not a defect (but a handicap, IMO).  So if you set this camera on a tripod and start recording, you have to hit the record button every 12 minutes to continue.  This means that your video will not be smooth.  You'll have segments of video clips that don't seam together smoothly.It's 12min per 4GB on 24P, 30P and 60P.  By the way, I haven't had any overheating issues while recording.  But the camera does become WARM.  I was doing these test on a 68 degrees ambient room temp.  I'm not sure about summer time recording.  The user manual does mention about overheating.I'm really trying to love this camera, but I think I've been spoiled by my camcorder.But if you've read this far in this review, here's what I like about it:CONVENIENCE!  It's great to have a DSLR that can shoot excellent still shots and do HD video.SIZE! I've been to places where I absolutely can't bring both a DSLR (with 3 L-series lenses) and a camcorder at the same time... too much baggage and weight.  This consolidates everything in a nice small package.  It's small enough to not attract too much attention.  It's not as big as my camcorder, hence I can finally use a small camera bag.VARIO-SCREEN.  This is a camcorder trait that's finally on a DSLR.  I LOVE IT!  I can finally take some low or high position shots with ease.IMAGE QUALITY:  I own a Canon Rebel XT and the Canon 5D classic (not MK2).  This camera produces some really nice image, especially if you use some high quality lens.PRICE: I was thinking of getting the 60D, but price became a leading factor.  I paid $659 new, body only.Final thoughts:  I will most likely keep the camera because I already own some nice Canon lenses, but for those still debating about getting the Canon T3i or even the Nikon equivalent, I would recommend you look at the Sony A65.Why didn't I get the Sony A65?  I'm in too deep with Canon.  I've already bought some great lenses for the Canon Mount.  If you read this review and genuinely considered this camera, I suggest you get the SONY A65.  It has all the dislikes that I have about this camera fixed on their camera and more.  But if you already have some canon lenses, hold off until next year.  Canon MAY come out with a new DSLR body that can fix all of these issues.Recommendation:  If you decide to get this camera, then get a battery pack grip attachment with extra batteries!!!  YOU WILL NEED IT.  The battery that came with the camera (Genuine Canon) died before I can even fill up my 16GB card.  I did straight HD shooting with no rest and the battery indicator turned RED.  The screen is constantly on when you video shoot.  The optical view finder can't be used while HD recording because of the mirror flipped and locked.  This is an absolute essential if you decide to get some accessories.Good luck and shoot!", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome but I am knocking down a star because...", "Author": "peederj", "ReviewID": "R2ETET8T90UQ17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They applied cripple-by-annoyance to motivate upsales.What I mean by that is they intentionally decided to look for ways to make people want their more expensive cameras, since the sensor technology has gotten so good that this is just as good as the 7D optically (there are some metering differences etc. but really...those aren't hard to overcome). And one way they found to do just that is by making the camera make far more noise than it needs to when doing continuous shooting.There is a mirror lockup feature, and there is a live view mode which locks up the mirror, and there is a continuous shooting mode which better photographers will use especially in this day of essentially unlimited exposure memory. The mirror lockup is intended to minimize vibration by keeping the mirror in place when the shutter releases, but it will also keep things quiet during continuous shooting, where you are machine-gunning off tons of shots in rapid sequence.Sadly, this otherwise nearly perfect camera decides to flip the mirror up and down every single shot of a continuous sequence, and despite all those settings available, none of them are allowed to work. That makes this product embarrassing to use in a quiet space! What company wants to embarrass people for using their product?!?This is why people have created 3rd party firmware for these cameras called Magic Lantern. It's buggy and I don't know if it fixes this particular cripple but they might put it in if people ask. I have not loaded it into my camera but this sort of thing really tempts me.Otherwise this camera is totally awesome for the money. I would also like to be able to zoom in on the image preview (the view of your image that comes up right after you take the picture) which oddly was available on some of Canon's point-and-shoots from years ago. That would let me see quickly if I got sharpness. For video, I would like to be able to completely clear the screen of distractions...there is a white rectangle showing where zooming will happen that I can't seem to get rid of. I would also like to have the histogram available while I'm filming video, and an edge finder feature for focus (see some high-end Marshall LCD monitors).The Digital Zoom 3x-10x is bolted on, requiring a vulcan neck pinch to get going...I sense they weren't sure of this feature, there were bitter arguments about it, not least of which because it's explosive to their product line. Not only is it their only DSLR that offers it right now, I have done the tests and discovered that the 3x digital zoom avoids Canon's achilles heel of DSLR video: It no longer does line skipping when at 3x! This means that the aliasing and moire that dogs all Canon DSLR video at this time (they need to implement a simple anti-aliaser for video capture...c'mon guys) is solved on the T3I/600D as long as you are zoomed 3x. The reason is obvious, it's just using the center pixel sensors rather than the entire 18MP sensor...so it's only working with ~2MP natively and doesn't have to drop anything. This image is great, but when you multiply 3x time 1.6x crop sensor you need a very wide angle lens to work this way without line skipping.I am sure they are withholding anti-aliasing for two reasons: 1) they want to make it exclusive to their high-end cameras first, and those have a longer product cycle, and 2) there must be bitter acrimony within the company about the DSLR division eating the video division's lunch. Nikon et al. will eat Canon's lunch if Canon doesn't eat its own as lunch...that's why we have this great camera, and that's why Canon is going to have to serve us all with uncrippled products soon enough.

Anything more powerful (or with more buttons to figure out) was going to be a waste of money on my part.  The T2i will do more than I probably will EVER need and the price point was just right.  When my p&s; camera first bit it, I had seen the all new Canon EOS 60D & immediatley decided that I HAD TO HAVE IT.  I am so glad that I fought off the urge to purchase it before doing some research.  The T2i is a great beginner-intermediate camera for someone who have never owned a DSLR.  I could'nt be more thrilled with my purchase...my kids however, they really enjoyed that month of research time when MOM was cameraless!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "canon T3i", "Author": "Luis Trujillo", "ReviewID": "RW7ZO37YRLEGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR and just love this camera(still learning how to use it).I ended chosing canon over nikon because I prefer canon on screen menu, it's quicker to acces all the parameters I want to change.the feel is nice I like the grip texture, weight is about right.I'm glad I got this model insted of the T2i because it's nice to have the swivel screen and even I don't have it yet I can allready see that I could benefit from a wireless flash.Note: you must get a tripod(still don't have one but I desperatly need one) or at least a low light lense like the 50mm f1.8(have one) to be able to take pictures at night(or in dark places) wiouth using the flash and with a low ISO setting.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "a good upgrade from the XTi and a better bargain than the 60d", "Author": "Justin C Johnson", "ReviewID": "R340CQP96AD7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was an upgrade for my wife from her Rebel XTi, which she's used for over 30,000 photos in about 3 years.  it's slightly bigger than the XTi and the size of the rear screen means buttons have been moved around so it took a little getting used to, but the image quality is very good.the new LCD on the back is great and the resolution helps you determine whether your shot is focused.  the focusing is great when shooting stills, but it's painfully slow when doing video so you'd be better off with a canon lens that does Full Time Manual focus.one downside is the disappearance of the sensor that used to sit below the viewfinder and turned the screen off when the camera was put to your eye.  now you have to turn it off with a half-press of the shutter.  i do not like this change.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "dee", "ReviewID": "R3VM7I17G5ERSY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its is great quality. images look almost real. im still struggling taking pix with it at night, because its too smart to catch any pic but im working on it", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Smart choice for DSLR newbie and amateur", "Author": "Hyman \"HD\"", "ReviewID": "R3CJHU348TGYW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great \"entry level\" DSLR for those DSLR newbies or amateurs.GOOD: high definition CMOS; high ISO (100-6400);good picture quality; crystal sharp lcd screen for picture review and the lcd screen also is turn-able for framing whenever you need it; support full HD video; very easy to operate.Bad: no complain so far.

What I especially didn't care for was the washed out colorless images starting around ISO 1600.

I think my biggest complaint with this camera is simply that it is overated and over priced for what you get. I sold mine and purchased a Pentax K-5lls which is definately a step up price wise, but even the Pentax K-30 that two aquiantences purchased offer better image quality, pentaprism viewfinder, faster continuous shooting (6 vs 3.7) that actually works, weather sealed body, in-camera shake reduction so EVERY lens placed on the camera has shake reduction, in camera lens correction for front or back focusing issues, and two scroll wheels for much faster and easier adjusting of things like ISO,shutter speed, and aperture.

Olson", "ReviewID": "R36XAPRANCA8U3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE AT END OF REVIEW!!!  FROM 1 STAR TO 4.I have been a hardcore Canon fan for more than a quarter century.  I have owned a couple of pre-Rebel cameras, 5 Rebels - 2 film, 3 digital - 2 video recorders, 2 photo printers, and too many lenses, filters, and accessories to inventory here.  I have been faithful to the brand because I have never had a dud or even a problem though I've treated the items with anything but kid gloves.  With the exception of this camera, all items purchased continue to function perfectly even though I have been extremely tough on many of them.  For example, several of the earlier cameras and lenses have been exposed to desert environments (dust storms, heat exceeding 105 degrees, and no shade for hours at a time), challenging uses (took one or more at a time rock climbing & strapped it/them - camera & lens - to me as I climbed.  Needless to say it/they banged against the rock face several times during these adventures), and dampness, sometimes extreme (coastal environments, beaches, storms, rain, etc.).  In spite of the abuse, and lack of regular care or cleaning, they all continued to perform wonderfully.  Then came along the T3i.  Knowing I was planning another trip to Costa Rica in February 2012, I decided to again upgrade my digital Rebel collection in December 2011.  I received the new camera promptly & was excited by it's look and feel, a wonderful improvement over some earlier versions.  Still easy to use and mostly intuitive, and best of all, loved the pictures I got - super clear and sharp!  I thought this was my best purchase yet!So, what's my problem?  Since I made this purchase I used this camera (lightly and gently) on my Costa Rica trip, a 3 day trip to Moab, Utah, and for a portion of a child's Easter egg hunt on Easter Sunday 2013.  Why only for a portion?  Because half way through the egg hunt the camera would no longer auto focus.*  I have done everything I can think of to get it to work.  I have charged, then changed the batteries, tried different lens that work with other Rebels, made sure the lens I was using worked on the others cameras, cleaned the contacts and camera thoroughly.  Nothing.  I can't sense to get a decent shot out of this camera anymore.  So, I decide to take it to a camera shop to see if I can get it repaired, and they tell me the cost is 175 dollars just to look at it, and it will likely cost several hundred to fix.  So it seems my 600 dollar, nearly new/almost unused camera will cost me as much or more than I paid for it to fix it after two and a half light uses?  Suddenly not such a fan of Canon or their Rebel line.By the way - the camera and lenses were all properly stored in dry, cool space with plenty of padding and dust protection along with my older equipment which continues to function flawlessly in spite of how rough I was with them (the older items) when I was younger and more daring.*I often use auto focus these days because as I get older the camera \"sees\" much more clearly than I do, especially when my \"targets\" are moving, such as children \"hunting\" eggs.UPDATE:Ok, I feel really dumb now.  Being determined not to spend as much as I paid for the camera to have it fixed, I have been holding out, using other cameras, and playing with my T3i periodically to see if there was an easy fix.  For whatever reason, it only occurred to be this morning to check the dioptric adjustment knob and some of the buttons on the back of the camera for unintended adjustments.  Sure enough that was the problem.  After checking the dioptric adjustment, which moves very freely on my camera, and some of the buttons on the back (still not sure quite what I did here) my camera is back as good as ever.  I must have touched these adjustments while putting the camera in my case or taking it out.  I've never had this happen with any of my other cameras.  Caused a fair amount of frustration, but in the end I probably have to own some of the problem.  With that said, I also don't think it should be so easy to completely mess up settings on a camera, so I'm keeping one star for what I consider a design or manufacturing flaw (not sure which).", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I expected more.", "Author": "V.

And when you press record on the camera, the HDMI Out drops its signal even more, to Standard Definition. For us, this is a major issue. If your workflow only requires you to record internally to your SD card, and you're totally content having your original footage saved as an h.264 file, this isn't a problem. In addition, a few Canon DSLRs (and maybe others) have a well-known limited record time, approximately 10 minutes before overheating then shutting down. To reduce compression and loss of color, and to increase our record time, we planned to use the HDMI Out and save our footage to an external recorder in a better format. We were unpleasantly surprised to find that this cannot be done. Limitations such as these should be boldly disclosed in Canons documentation.

Basically it has sharper video, better remote functions with EOS Utility, EXCEPT on big negative\u2026no remote playback..you have to lean over the back of the camera and push a button if you are doing YouTube videos of yourself talking.  The EOS Utility needs to have a remote playback.  The audio sounds better but there is NO headphone out and Magic Lantern does not support this with the 600d\u2026supposedly the next version will.  But the audio out cable goes into the USB port, then same port that the EOS Utility uses to remotely use the camera.  The third negative is the 12 minute record length before you are cut off and need to hit record again.  But the EOS Utility sure beats the remote control on the M400.  Maybe an Android remote to playback is offered but I downloaded Remote Controller App (beta) on my Nexus 10 and 7 and now neither one works, so that is an iffy process, especially with an OTG cable and all.  Lots of people use the Zoom H4n external recorder and then sync up with the video in iMovie, FCP, Premiere Elements and Pro, but I don't want to hassle syncing, and I doubt if most people do.  Of course once you have the audio adjusted then theres on need to monitor the for YouTube type videos of oneself talking.

I've owned my 600d for close to a year, and taken hundreds of photos with it.  This was my first foray beyond point-and-shoots.The main problem I have is the idea of a \"consumer\" level DSLR.  I've paid several times more for lenses than I did for the camera.  After investing in the glass I find myself wondering why I didn't just get the 5d and been done with it.I guess that's the crux of the matter.  Anyone who would be happy with the basic kit, nifty fifty, and a couple other lenses like the 75-300 would be better served by a bridge camera or superzoom.  Anyone who's willing to outlay the cash for red rings would be better off with the 5d.  I just don't see the purpose for lower end DSLRs as anything more than a stop-gap or learning tool, tasks that could be done just as easily by the 1100d or even, gasp, an old film SLR.On a side note, unless you're at the end of your budget, don't get the 18-55 kit lens.

I found D-SLR to be too much of a hassle, it was better than my Leica point-n-shoot, but not enough to carry a back pack full of lenses or even just the camera in a case opposed to something pocket sized. Well, for Hawaii I wanted to make sure the pictures were great so bought this camera, but after taking about 100 shots on it and comparing it to what my Nokia 1520 could do, the 1520 was taking better looking images due to the Nokia Pro software and it's awesome white-balance adjustment, you could just tap on the screen for what you wanted to adjust \"based on\" and darker portions of the photo, say a shady area in a cliff immediately gained detail, and without washing out other parts of the scene. I was comparing to the Canon in Landscape mode, I'm certain that I could have gotten better pictures from the Canon after adjusting the manual settings, but that takes a while to dial in, and taking test shots and comparing, which I really didn't have the patience for. It's not that I\"m extremely impatient, just weight the \"is the juice worth the squeeze\" and with Nokia making up to 40MegaPixel camera phones with killer software and their \"Carl Zeis\" lens, I can get pictures there that suit my needs and actually looked better.  I'm really disappointed that the software in the camera wasn't a lot better. All of my friends I told laughed and said I must be doing it wrong and probably don't need a DSLR, I asked them to compare and they admitted that I was right.. just food for thought.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Problem with the lens", "Author": "Ycaro", "ReviewID": "R7KG4YVVYR4C7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The lens came without the front cover.

I really did.When it functioned correctly, it took some very good photos. However, for video; this thing is sadly lacking. For one thing, it would constantly overheat; even when being used in an air conditioned space. It could never record more than 6-8 minutes of 1080 video  without overheating. Attempted to record a school concert, what recordings were obtained; were awful.Images taken, quickly become grainy when the light is anything less than optimum.From my viewpoint, the menu system is too cumbersome. With large hands, it was difficult to hold and use the camera. It was awkward to access the various wheels and buttons.The screen was difficult to view while outside. ANY glare rendered it completely useless. Used inside, you have to shift your head or screen to find the right angle for viewing. Even then it was often hard to read.Barreling was noted in some test images. An image with a flag pole against a bright blue and slightly cloudy sky turned the flagpole  into an arc rather than straight line.The auto focus would function adequately for pictures, but only with absolutely optimum lighting. When you shoot video; you could never get the image crisp using either auto or manual focus. Even when you mange to get the subject crisp, any panning quickly resulted in blurred and/or soft images. If you prefer to shoot video with all in focus, forget about the included 18 - 55 mm lens. It was painful to try and manually focus this lens and of course the auto focus never worked correctly.It's probable the unit tested was defective. But unwilling to risk an exchange, the camera was promptly returned for refund.I've generally had satisfactory experiences with canon products, however; this one failed to meet my needs, expectations and preferences.

For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.  I just think that someone should point out the fact that there are other options out there and better technology available.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad quality images, movies", "Author": "nobody ya know", "ReviewID": "R2KIJ7PWKX6OBO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really hate to say this, being a Canon guy who has tons of Canon camcorders and cameras, but this T3i is pure JUNK.I got the 18-55mm kit lens and tried it out.not a single image is sharp! I am a pro photog and video guy with 40 years of experience, so I know how to take a picture or shoot video.Set the camera on AUTO mode, what can be wrong here... well the same blurry image. Nothing in focus, yet it showed it was in focus. Yes, the LIVE VIEW or the optical view does show a CLEAR image, but when loaded onto a computer, it's all blurry when you look at it a bit closer. I compaired with several Nikon DSLR just to make sure maybe my eyes are not good as use to be... the Nikon images from a low cost D-40 is far superior with a kit lens than this 18mp image is full of noise in full sunlight, on AUTO mode or ANY OTHER settings.This was out of the box BAD.Sent it Canon and they sent it back as 'fixed'. NOTHING has changes and they say it's normal and all is OK.Am asking you, If I shoot a 1.2Mp setting on a D40 Nikon and a 18mp setting on T3i and the Nikon is superior quality and sharpness then this T3i what do you think it's wrong? To Canon repair it is fine.Then I set it to 1.2Mp or slightly higher on the T3i and the images is sooooo blurred even a toy camera can do better.Next I used an old Canon SD-800 camera set at 1mp (close to it) and it's image is superiour to this Canon 18Mp !So, it's not me and  not knowing how to use a camera. I have six DSLR and many other cams.Canon refuse to replace this LEMON and just giving me the run around.In addition the Movie mode shuts off with a Class-10 SD card after a ten seconds. NOT selected the 10 seconds shots... but it does it on its own. After five tries, finally gets to record in video mode. The image quality is so bad, with the kit lens and other lenses from 24mmm to 50mm. Makes no difference, but the prime lens is a 'sharper' BLURRY image... if you can believe it.So, I have a $1K down the toilet and Canon don't stand behind their products.I urge everyone buying any Canon model DSLR to check it out within a few days and if no good, take it back to the STORE!I missed that opportunity and now stuck with this 'repair' revolving door and getting nowhere.This maybe a refurbish by Canon or someone taken this back to the store, repackaged and sold as new.... at Walmart.I don't blame Walmart, and I don't think they have anything to do with refurbish or re-sold cameras without indicating as such.

If you take lots of video, buy a point-and-shot or a real camcorder, which makes video-talking a lot of easier and more fun.(3) If you have Mac running 10.4, you should know that none of the new software coming with this camera works!

But I know from looking at the menu and specs I really like my Pentax K-X.  The software with this camera is bland and not as advanced. It only offers a few filter options, including Toy Camera, Fisheye (which a lens is better anyway), Black and white.  I have read reviews and have heard that Canon's have more \"noise\" in the pictures, so hopefully I do not notice this.  I know sometimes my Pentax can cast a slight grey tint to it, I'm hoping with a Canon I do not have this conflict.  I purchased this camera to escape my comfortzone from my Pentax addiction, but I'm pretty sure in most cases I will use my Pentax.  Once I take a test run, I will further update, and I'm only judging by the software that is on the camera I am not impressed.  The camera is lightweight, the lens isn't that wonderful (but then again, I have always had Pentax lenses, so I'm trying to be open about the change).  I have purchased an adapter but still am debating on the first lens to buy for this camera.  The functions as in processing of the a picture is amazingly fast, I am impressed by that.  I am excited about the 18 MP!  I'll follow up once I get a session in and maybe post some pictures.  This is my first Canon SLR I have ever used, so bare with me.Update:I hate it.
