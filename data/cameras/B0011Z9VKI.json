She is not technologically oriented so I needed one that was simple yet took excellent pictures.  This is it.  So many features and the automatic settings are so intelligent. It is must have with image stabilization.  Now, no pictures get blurred.  It also has regular batteries that I replaced with rechargeable ones. She was thrilled at receiving it and the ease of using it.  Panasonic did a great job. I bought a more advanced model for myself.  My Lumix DMC-TZ3 model is great also.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Gustavojgc \"Gustavojgc\"", "ReviewID": "R7CTRBLGKT18R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera!

I didn't want to take my Nikon DSLR as I was going to be volunteering, therefore I didn't know what to expect as far as accommodations for my things.  I was glad I made the purchase, let me tell you.It has a compact design, but it is weighty and lacks protrusions other than the feature knob at the top.  This is key to keep from things breaking off with normal use.  I've dropped this camera several times and it has not broken once!  When I took it to the aforementioned Iditarod race, I fell on it (long story) and it suffered no ill effects.  I, however, did!That was over a year ago, and the camera is still going strong.  The functions are easy to use and even though it is an 8 mp, there aren't a whole lot of unnecessary bells and whistles to it.  Which is good, since I hate seeing pretentious point-and-shoots touted with attributes that only someone using a DSLR should be using.  There is simply no comparison between the two as far as quality, depth and focus.But, if you're looking for a cheaper, well-built camera to carry in your purse or pocket, this is the camera for you.  My great-grandpa always said Lumix lenses were the best, and he was right.My only gripe is having to use AA batteries.  I always try to get cameras with battery packs, but I was in a bind and yada yada.  It sucks the power out of those pretty quickly.  But considering I was outside for 8 hours in 10 degree weather, the batteries held up well enough to take quite a few pictures and videos.And a note on the videos, there is no microphone in the camera, so you get some great quality silent movies.  Can't have everything I guess.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "D.

Excellent value for the performance to be had as it takes crystal clear pictures with an auto \"macro\" mode for up-close detail shots of the things I build.

I wanted a camera which could reproduce fairly accurately, the colors on a watercolor painting.  Myprevious digital camera had just a few settings for close-ups and distance photos.  This camera has a lot more options.  Yesterday,the 26th, I was experimenting with the different scene modes.  I randomly took pictures of one of my paintings using 6 different scene modes.  Three of the photos were too dark.  The other three were good, but only one of them was spot on.  Unfortunately, I can't remember which scene mode it was.The camera is relatively small, about the size of a deck of cards.  I like how the tripod mount is away from the battery area.  I can easily change the batteries without removing the camera from the tripod. This is a nice feature.The camera has an intelligent mode which is okay, if you are not too particular about the results.  If you want the color to be spot on, you should find the scene mode that most closely matches your settings.  Intelligent Mode hasn't proved to be that intelligent so far.", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "so well designed, can't belive it's under $100", "Author": "Danil", "ReviewID": "R1U6XWL53SUG00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "picked one up at Fry's but getting 2 more here since it's much less $.  I take a lot of photos for work up to 2000 per day on some days .. so I go through a few cameras a year and I've tried many. So far Canons were my favorite until I came across this one.This is a very well though through camera since almost all budget cameras out there take good photos it really comes down to comfort & functionality. This is where it shinesGOODS:-IMAGE STABILIZATION !!!! - no more blurry pics (a must have especially when using zoom)-INSTANT AF (auto focus) this comes with CCD sensors - fast focus time-front facing zoom wheel control (don't have to loose grip trying to work those w/t zoom buttons on the back of other cameras)-Excellent grip for large hands and still flat profile to fit in a slim case-fast turn on time-4.8X zoom at 3(and less) megapixel setting-flash setting memory - it remember flash mode used, so if you turn on/off your camera often you don't need to change your flash mode again (answer to my prayers)-2,5\" excellent quality LCD with auto adjusting back lit,-ISO 400-1600,-real switches for on/off and shoot/play (not buttons) - won't press any by accident (as with Canons and others)-AA batteries and SD card(up to 16gb high capacity) - the most practical combination for traveling and work-separate doors for batteries and SD card so you don't wear the plastic battery door yanking the card in and out.-nice quality natural photosCONS:-5-6 second flash recharge time-lack of accessories (case for underwater shooting etc)Well built, solid feel, good looking camera: black case, chrome trim. Real work horse. Strongly recommendMake sure to buy a set of SANYO ENELOOP rechargeable batteries.---------------- REVISED OVER A YEAR LATER ----------------------No built in Date stamp, which is a deal breaker for me. Every company out there requires a date stamp on photos. The only way to get by is to use the built in \"text stamp\" feature. Basically, at the end of the day you go into the menu and select \"text stamp\" - \"Date\" -> selection menu - have to go through every photo and put a check mark on it, \"exit\" and \"apply\". The camera will take another 5 minutes to label 300 photos or so, by saving a modified copy to your SD card (which is fine if you have a large enough card, take photos at 3megapixel setting) and have enough juice in your battery, because it sure sucks that juice out while it's doing it.. so I'm back to CANONS :( and keep these as backup and for personal use.", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Jason S.

As someone who needs a camera for leisure/personal purposes, this takes nice pictures and is easy to use. Also, we were able to get a memory card from another Amazon.com seller for around $10, which was well below the retail price...am guessing that this has to do with the camera and accessories being just barely out the \"new\" model range, but something from a season or two ago.So I don't have a ton of experience with cameras, but I am pleased with this purchase.

Definitely recommend for a Point and Shoot camera that does all of the work but also gives you plenty of options to manually adjust the settings.  Nice and lite in weight and fits in pocket.

The photos come out great and it's very easy to play back your shots and delete ones you don't want to keep.The bad points are that it tends to be a little slow between shots and can not be recharged on its own (need to provide your own seperate rechargeable batteries or bring lots of spares).
