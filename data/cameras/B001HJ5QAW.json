{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent photos", "Author": "P.

I was a bit skeptical as I've never owned any sanyo products before.  However, the photos are very good quality; it's got tons of features, and it takes video to boot (built in mic).  As I've said, had mine almost a year and a half now and it's still going strong, haven't even had to replace the battery yet.  Love this camera.Edited to add: around the 2 year mark, the charger stopped charging the battery.  Not sure if the battery just went bad or if it was the actual charger.  But it was a better deal to just get a new digital camera rather than buy a new battery and then buy a charger as well if it wasn't the battery after all.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA!!!", "Author": "J.

It's compact takes great photos at night even when it is not in night mode!!! I really can't say nothing bad about this camera its great!!", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good camera...", "Author": "Alexia Ford \"Online shopaholic\"", "ReviewID": "RDH2JZ1ZVGBR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had mine for just over 2 years now. I love it, it's got it's issues, sure, but for family shots and photography beginners, (or those a little intimidated by the larger cameras) this one's a good deal.Pros: Pretty decent quality shots, we take photos on the highest resolution so they're easy to print in good quality. It's super simple- point and shoot. I definitely advise getting a SD card for it though.Cons: It's slow. There's a pretty decent delay between when you hit the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. If you're looking to take a lot of action shots, I wouldn't advise this being your choice. (Forget photographing fireworks, we tried, wasn't pretty lol)Overall, I recommend this camera for people who aren't photography buffs. If you're THAT into photos, spend the money on a higher priced camera. We bought this one mainly for my use- my other half has a big bulky thing- and for me and the kids, this one's been great.Update: 6/29/11 Do not expect this camera to last as long as ours did. We were having power problems (the batteries went from fully charged to dead in about 10 minutes) so we purchased a new battery. The same issue is happening with the new one. As far as I'm aware the camera has never been dropped or roughly handled and obviously something is wrong with it. I'm not finding any information on the issue, but it looks like we'll be buying a new one soon. Not keeping a charge is a bad thing.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Flimsy ... unfortunate.", "Author": "Michael J. Wolfert", "ReviewID": "RZAH20MM7GBDW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The VPC-E870 has a problem with being extremely flimsy. This is unfortunate as it comes with so many features and is incredibly priced. Also the pictures are quite good. After 8 months I put in an alternate usb line to transfer pictures ... I pressed in the cord ... (did I press it in too hard or something ) as the power suddenly went out. It is just too flimsy.I will send a note to Sanyo as well.I reccommend spending a bit more on a better built camera.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "PIECE OF JUNK", "Author": "Joyce McGuire", "ReviewID": "R14YEY5260281C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for my mother for christmas. We like everybody else we did most of our shopping thanksgiving weekend. My mother loved it when she opened at our christmas get together 12-26.  March 1st it would not turn on. Walmart's warranty is only for 30 days, but they did check the battery and it was fine, so they gave us the Sanyo 800 number which my mother called twice never could get a live person and left a message both times.  Phone calls were never returned. So I contact them through their customer service website. Their reply is \"it's over 90 days from date of PURCHASE they WON'T GO BY GIFT DATE so we can not warranty this camera\"  It stopped working 3 days after warranty went out.  DON'T BUY SANYO!!!!!!", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed with product but end result was tolerable.", "Author": "whitetail deer", "ReviewID": "R2C41C3XOTSGK8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera did not work when I received it.

The mic functions poorly but the battery life is quite long and the interface is simple.Overall, it's a good camera for day to day use and can create some spectacular shots. :)", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001HJ5QAW"}}
