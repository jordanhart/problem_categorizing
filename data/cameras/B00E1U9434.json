{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AWESOME camera! :-)", "Author": "S. MACLEOD \"voracious reader\"", "ReviewID": "R479ZJBZPB0UA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera today, and so far, I love it! I got it after I returned the Nikon CoolPix L28 (after having it for less than 24 hours!), which was a piece of garbage. The Fujifilm is a good, solid little \"point and shoot\" camera, easy to use right out of the box. It takes great pictures, focuses quickly, and doesn't lag hardly at all between rapid shots (I've found that all \"point and shoot\" digitals have a bit of lag time while the shot processes). It fits in the hand nicely, and the controls are easy to understand and use. Pictures on the view screen look good, and uploaded, they are *really* good.What's strange is, in the description here, it says the camera has a rechargeable battery. It doesn't. It uses 2 AA batteries, which is actually better for me.So far, I am really impressed. I would definitely recommend this camera.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Oh, what a joy!", "Author": "NOCTULE", "ReviewID": "R1P14RXZ7YVZ2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're like me and completely frustrated by all the lousy quality and overly complicated mid-price digital cameras out there, fret no more.  You'll be absolutely delighted with this one!  It's a breeze to operate instantly, takes much nicer quality photos than any other camera in this price range does, and it has directions right on the screen for almost everything, so how can you fail?  You can just feel the quality of the camera.  What else can I say, except \"Love, love, love it!!!\"  At last.  No more aggravation!", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.00", "Features": "5X Optical Zoom\nUSB cable and CD-ROM ( aps & manual) included\n16 Megapixels with 2.7\" veiwing screen", "Name": "FUJIFILM AX655 Digital Camera with 16 Megapixels and 5x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mH-mSH-BL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E1U9434"}}
