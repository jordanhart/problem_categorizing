It has excellent features at this price point, with easy menus and click wheels to get at them. I particularly liked that you can use the 10x zoom when you are videoing. Suprisingly other cameras I looked at could not.Here are a few tips. To open the bay that holds the battery and memory card, drag the door forward with your thumb (use the raised dots for a better grip) then you can lift it up. I had trouble transferring longer video clips with the USB cable; instead, put your SDHC memory card in a card reader (I used the Targus Universal 32 in 1 card reader/writer). I missed one tip that is in the manual the first time I read through it: once you press the shutter button down to start recording, you don't need to keep holding it down.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fuji JZ500 Camera", "Author": "Gary Martin", "ReviewID": "R2ZVV0Y5I6RA6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent picture quality.

The zoom on it is really good. I used this camera on the video mode to capture some water falls in the state of Connecticut it really was awesome.

The extreme amount of glare trying to take a photo simply by looking at the small screen is just impossible. You can't tell what you are looking at.
