I was looking for a camera...I finally settled on the Fuji 2800Z. To date, I am extremely please with my purchase, as I have found this camera to be an excellent value for the money.Some of the positives of this camera include, a killer 6x Optical Zoom, Sharp and Crisp Pictures, extremely easy to use menu system, 60 second video with audio, and it can double as a webcam.  This camera is pretty much a point and shoot camera so if you are looking for a digital camera that has a wide selection of manual settings, look elsewhere as this camera is not for you. You do, however, have control over the white balance, exposure, and flash settings. Other than that, the rest is automatic.As I mentioned, this is a great little camera, however it is not without a few \"flaws\". As well noted, this camera has trouble in low light situations, specifically the EVF and LCD. In the few weeks that I have had the camera and the several hundred pictures that I have taken, I have only run into 1 situation where the EVF and LCD were useless. This issue can be worked around and should not be a sticking point for those looking to purchase this camera. I personally like using the EVF as, unlike an optical viewfinder, it shows you \"exactly\" what is being photographed without distortion. Finally, if you decide to pick up this camera, make sure that you get some rechargeable batteries and a 128mb Smart Media card. You will be set.In summary, if you are looking for a simple to use, point and shoot camera, with a great zoom, sharp pictures, and a few additional nice features, get this camera. You will be hard pressed to find a better camera for the money!", "Date": "March 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "I am having fun with this camera", "Author": "Hanyu Xiao", "ReviewID": "RFYBANC0V9SXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my Fujifilm Finepix 2800 three days ago and here's my first take.The camera has a good look, and feels sturdy with the all-metal case. Its width is about that of a credit card, so you can say it's small; however it\u2019s pretty thick (comparable to its width) due to its 6x zoom lens, so it won't fit in your shirt pocket. I have only taken indoor photos, and the image quality is excellent. The photos usually look very nice as is, without having to be fixed by a photo editor. The 6x optical zoom was a big factor in my decision to buy this camera. It doesn't work well for me when taking indoor pictures. I would have to keep the camera absolutely steady under the full zoom or the picture comes out blurry. A friend of mine has an Olympus C-2100, which has a 10x zoom. It comes with image stablization, which is probably absent in Finepix 2800 (at least I didn't find any mentioning of it).The electronic view finder (EVF) gave mixed results. On the one hand, it is great to be able to see everything with EVF, including the menus. This removes the need to switch on the LCD just to change some menu settings, and as a result, you get longer battery life. On the other hand, the EVF was completely useless in a low light setting. The room wasn't that dark, but the EVF was totally blank when I pointed the camera to a dark area, so was the LCD. I had to point the camera to the general direction and let the flash do its job. Luckily the picture came out OK, but still I wished I had an optical view finder at the time. The webcam is very easy to set up. You'd use the menu to set the so-called \"USB mode\" to \"webcam\", and then connect the camera to the PC through the USB cable, just as if you were uploading the pictures. Then you'll launch the PictureHello program and that's it. The captured image is pretty dark, though.It is just as easy to take a video as to take photos. The movie is a little dark, tough, when taken indoors. Fuji says in the manual that the operation of the camera is only guaranteed when it's used with Fuji SmartMedia cards. However I am using a 128MB Mr. Flash SM card I bought (...) and the camera took it without incident. I also bought 1600mAh NiMH batteries and a charger from newegg.com. The price was great, so was the service. I highly recommend them.The battery life seems very good. I have taken over 100 indoor photos, all using the flash, and the 1600mAh batteries are still going strong. As I mentioned earlier, it certainly helped not to have to switch on the LCD very often, but I didn't go out of my way to avoid using it.Software installion on my Windows 2000 laptop went smoothly. It was actually a series of independent installations for USB driver, FinepixViewer, QuickTime, VideoImpression, and Microsoft Media Player, etc. You can also install Adobe's PhotoDeluxe and ActiveShare.All in all, I am having lots of fun with this camera. It has its limitations, such as the lack of TV out and certain manual controls. But I would say at this price level you won't find another comparable camera that has such a rich set of features.", "Date": "November 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Fuji 2800Zoom - Pleased", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RTOBJ62T9MFL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(...) I liked the fact that it looks like a camera and that it is quite small, compact and light weight. I did some research, but honestly not that much. I was interested in optical Zoom, and the 6x optical zoom is what made me buy the Fuji 2800Zoom. Most of the other digital cameras in my price range only had 3x Optical zoom. So far I've taken at least 50 pictures and I am very pleased. The software installed easily and worked the first time on both of my computers, Win98 and Win2000 Professional. The only problem I have is that the on/off button is right where the 'take a picture' button is on other cameras, which means that I have turned the camera off, instead of taking a picture on at least 4 or 5 times.I also like the fact that it has both a small eye viewfinder like a regular camera plus the eye viewfinder is also in color. Plus it has the LCD screen. The eye viewfinder is very useful in bright sunlight where you might not be able to see the LCD screen. You can change the LCD brightness also. Overall I am quite pleased with this camera. The Fuji 2800Zoom has 2 megapixels, which at first I thought might be a drawback since 5 megapixel cameras are now available, but now I see that the photos are very clear and sharp at the \"1M Normal\" setting, so that is not an issue. The camera allows you to change the settings for picture quality. There are 8 settings. Naturally the higher the setting the fewer pictures you can record on the card. The lesser the setting the more you can record. But at the Normal setting, on a 16Meg card you can still get about 50 pictures of very good quality. If you need more you can buy a higher meg card to store more photos. That's it, have fun.", "Date": "November 12, 2001"}, {"Title": "Fine  Aperture!!!", "Author": "\"jgodard1\"", "ReviewID": "R16YMTGA46DC52", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, in a nutshell- This camera takes great quality photos rich in color. The detail really does rival that of higher MP cameras. Much of this can be attributed to two factors. First, the 6X Optical zoom allows the photographer to bring the shot to them without the distortion that is caused by a Digital zoom. Second,  the lens Aperture, the size of the lens opening, is by far the largest of any digital camera I have seen in this price range. This large aperture gives the camera a greater light gathering ability and contributes to vivid color reproduction. The camera's case is made of plastic, which may seem flimsy to some, and will probably scratch if not handled carfully. If you plan on accompanying the 'crock hunter' on an outback photoshoot any time soon, I recommend finding a camera with a metal casing.The on-screen menus are logical and easy to navigate. The menus can be seen via the LCD (display screen) or the EVF (viewfinder). This camera has many amatuer features and they all work great. The movie feature has decent quality video (for a digicam) and good sound. Because the viewfinder is electronic and it's source is the zoom lens, this camera is effectively a digital SLR, which means that the image you see is exactly the image you get -a great plus.This camera's main drawback is it's display performance in low light situations. Both the LCD and EVF are useless at night, and indoor shots may become difficult under low light conditions. This may make it difficult to take advanced shots, as it may be impossible lock the focus on your subject properly. The flash will ensure that the pictures come out great, though, and its not like your wasting film if your subject isn't centered properly. Just fire away! Still its a major shortfall.Software works fine, but you may want to use something you're more familiar with.Get a set of Nickel Metal Hydride rechargable batteries. The higher the mAh the better as this determines how long the batteries will last per charge. I have found a set of 1800mAh batteries and they work great.", "Date": "June 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Its very very nice", "Author": "Stephen Rice \"STR\"", "ReviewID": "R3A8NKG235V29U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two digital cameras recently. Both of them Fuji. Mine is the 2600zoom finepix and the 2800zoom is the one I got for my wife. ( She thought it was 'cute'.) Personally, I like the 2600 better for a number of reasons. It comes with a battery recharger and two of the 1700mHa batteries by Fuji. The 2600 only takes two batteries instead of four like the 2800 does, and they last a long time.(The 2800 eats up the batteries, you will want to get extra batteries and a fast charger for it.) Overall both cameras are excellent and I give both 5 stars. The 2600 is just a better value when you weigh all features and benefits. You will have to order an a/c adapter for both cameras from Fuji as they are an option, and I had to buy a charger and rechargable batteries for the 2800 after the purchase. It comes with 4 alkaline batteries when you buy it. They lasted about 25 minutes before they were dead.(No lie) I don't particularly like the grainy look in the view finder of the 2800. I'm not fond of the way the viewer goes blank when you take the picture either. The 2600 doesn't have this grainy appearance at all and it doesn't blank out when you snap the pic. Of course the 2600 doesn't have the ability to show you the display and menu in the view finder like the 2800 does. The 2800 video mode is much better than the 2600 and the sound quality is quite impressive too.(No sound on the 2600) The one thing I found after the purchase is that most of the NiMH batteries you will find are 1600mHa and Fuji's are 1700mHa. This may seem slight but it makes a difference in how long the batteries last between charges and how fast they recover after each shot. I found some that were 1800mHa and Fuji told me not to use them as they may damage the camera. I recommend that you find 1700s because the 400mHa difference is quite noticable. The 5 volt a/c adapter for the 2800 and the 3 volt a/c adapter you can get for the 2600 both have plenty of length to the cord and I like that. Overall for the money the 2800 is a good deal but other than the 6x zoom feature it really doesn't take any better pics than my 2600 does. It was harder to find a case that would hold the 2800 than it was for my 2600 and the 2800 is heavy compared to the 2600. I'm glad the 2800 is my wife's camera really. The only time I'll use the 2800 is if I just have to zoom in twice as far for a shot. ... My wife thinks it was worth it and love the camera. I'd recommend either one but value for value the 2600 is a better deal. Fuji has got it going on with these little cameras. They are impressive. If they came with an a/c adapter and carry case and if the 2800 just had a charger and NiMH batteries it would be better but they'd be a lot more expensive up front I'm sure. The fact is though, these are both quite high in quality and supreme user friendly cameras.", "Date": "March 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fuji 2800 is a fantastic buy!", "Author": "R. Borsdorf \"bertdorf3\"", "ReviewID": "R21HBS6BINB57A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this Fuji 2800 camera for about 1 month now and I simply LOVE it. I took it on my recent trip to Key West Florida where I got some FANTASTIC quality shots. Zoom works wonderfully, but be very careful on full zoom... even the slightest movement will result in blurry pictures. The 6X zoom is why I bought the camera, and I quickly learned the difference between the digital zoom and optical zoom. The optical zooms in physically (you feel the lens move) while the digital gets you closer like on the monitor of a computer. Every time I zoomed to the full max, I set the camera on a stable surface and got incredibly nice photos!My suggestion is to buy a 128MB card, or two, and take all your pictures at the highest quality. Your choices for quality are BEST / High, mid, low... or MEDIUM / high, mid... or LOW / regular. That's 6 choices. If you have the space available on your card, why not get the best shot? The camera comes with a 16MB, I bought a 64MB, and on my week in Fla., I ended up lowering the quality to accommodate more photos, and when I viewed my pics at home, I saw a difference that didn't please me. If I had taken them all at mid quality, I may not have noticed, but size does matter! Capture the biggest image!As far as the video clip capabilities, I was pleasantly surprised. Takes up tons of space though. And don't expect fine detail. Add the sound and you end up with a jumpy at best, rough video of your cherished moment. If it's video you're after, take along a video camera. I did run home and e-mail the .avi file to all my friends and they were surprised too, simply at the fact that a digital camera can record video with sound. I have used several other digi-cameras that were slim and credit card sized, and I didn't like them. I am a big guy with big fingers, and I like the bigger camera. I can carry it in my front pocket in relative comfort, but then again, I wear big shorts. The camera is 3\" x 3.5\" x 3.5\". A cube. It has a nice grip to it, and it feels secure in my hand when I am on the boat. It comes with a lanyard for hanging on your neck but I never attached it. The lens cap is on a string, so be careful the string is out of the way when you snap the shot. My last digital camera had no lens cover, and the lens got scratched eventually. As far as not being able to see through the viewfinder at night or indoors, it is true, but you can almost always see something distinguishable, and in no time, one gets used to it. You see the captured image for a second after you snap it, so you can see if you cut someone's head off. The biggest problem is when you ask someone to take your picture for you, they get caught up on the fact that they can't see you clearly. Better off just using the self-timer, which is easy to use. I use it often.Pictures are easily and quickly erased if you want to erase them. So easy though, you can erase ones you didn't want to! There is no `undo' button... once they're gone, they're gone.One more feature I fell in love with is the suppressed flash. It allows you to take pictures of cityscapes, sunsets, etc., where there is a subject in front. I took a picture of my wife in front of one of those fabulous Key West sunsets, and it turned out incredibly. I took another of her in front of downtown San Francisco at night, and it too came out awesome. I have read people suggesting the AC adapter, but I see no reason to buy one. A full 128MB card can be downloaded into your computer within 2 minutes, maybe less. The camera, when turned on, automatically opens the image software, but several times in that process, my system has malfunctioned (Win98). I remedied it by simply opening the FinePix viewer first, then turning on the camera. Pictures pop right up, then I select them all, and drag them to another folder. Since pictures on a Smartmedia card are numbered from 0001 to the last, the folder should be empty, otherwise the computer tries to replace like-named pictures. As soon as they're moved, turn the camera off! It's that simple. DO buy some rechargeable batteries. Digital cameras can eat up disposable ones fast.This Fuji 2800 camera is the best buy for your buck, hands down.", "Date": "November 13, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best Camera for the Money", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "ROT12WJSSDWDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Digital Camera.

This is one of the few cameras even close to this price that you can take movies that long and it has sound. The lcd and viewfinder are both color . You can take pics that can be printed into 8x10's.

As for the Eve /LCd screen , I haven't had any problem with lighting in my house and I didn't turn on the lights during the day or open blinds and I had no problem using the lcd screen. Now the movies still turn out good but I do reccommend some lighting when shooting those. Another great feature is it is also a webcam. The last digital camera I bought cost more then this one plus I had to pay for a webcam separate. Its like getting a webcam for free. The sound quality is great for the movie footage and voice captioning. I love this camera! I shopped around for a couple of months online and instore and kept coming back to this camera!  I also really liked the added software . The adobe photo deluxe is a great ,easy to use, picture software , plus the 2800 also includes Video Impression for your home movies.

I had really enjoyed photography years ago on a good 35mm camera. I did a lot of comparisons, and this Fiji just seemed to come out on top for what I wanted to spend. Yet I just HAD to go to a store to try it out first-hand. Boy, was I impressed!! I picked up a display and the controls are so sensibily designed that I was using it-no problem-in just a minute or two. I even took a mini-video on it. (A great feature I haden't even counted on.) Another feature that sold me on this camera was the 6x optical zoom--a must-have feature for creative photography. The sales guy recommended I get a transfer device, and I'm glad I did. You put the memory card in it and download the pics into your computer.  (I got one called \"Dazzle\" and it's a snap.) I also bought a 128MB Smart Card for more memory.

The Kodak is a fine camera, but I was attracted to the 6X optical zoom and increased resolution of the FinePix 2800. I also did not want to pay an exoribitant price. After reading a number of reviews, I decided to give this camera a try. I have used it for a little more than two weeks and have been overjoyed with its performance. It is small, light, has plenty of features and the zoom performance is excellent. I could not find anything similar in this price range.  For a beginner or amateur photographer, I don't think you could ask for a better camera. It is simple to set up, has a wide variety of picture quality settings, plenty of options/features and is just pleasure to use. I also liked the built in USB interface (USB cable and software included). I would have liked to have seen an AC power supply included, but for the price I can't complain about the included accessories. I purchased a 128M SmartMedia card with the unit and can get over 350 pictures in the 2M Normal mode, which gives great resolution. This unit also seems to be a lot faster than the Kodak I own. The 2800 also supports video and voice over, although I have not tried either of these features. For video, I use my Canon ZR25M.

I looked at the Fuji Finepix 2800 Zoom and a few of the popular 3mp cameras.  I was very leary to get the 2mp over the 3mp but figured with the 6x zoom and the way lower price that it may have an advantage.  Let me tell you, I made the right decision.  Here's why:Photo Quality:  Incredible.  Better than I could have hoped for.  More than enough.  You can't crop down to nothing, but I printed a few 8X10's and it looked like an actual photograph.  2mp is enough for me.  PLUS, you usually don't even set the camera on the 2mp setting anyway, 1mp is usually plenty.Controls:  The automatic controls are very accurate.  I have used a 35mm Nikon SLR for years and it's nice not to have to fuss with all the manual settings.  This is primarily my wife's camera anyway and she appreciates just being able to point and shoot.  You do have to get used to the 1/2 second delay, but it's not a big deal and common with digital cameras.Viewfinder/LCD - Yeah its dark in low light, but you can still see an outline of your subject in most cases; unless its really dark, but I haven't had much of a problem and the one time I did get my 1 year old out of center I just took another shot.Overall - I'm very happy with this camera.  I can't say enough.  If you're leary about this camera like I was, don't be, it will exceed your expectations.  Oh by the way the web cam feature works great too.  Oh and make sure to get rechargeable batteries, and ac adapter for web cam and download and you'll be set.PS - I estimated that I saved about $200 by going with this camera over some of the other 3mp and in my opinion it can't be beat.", "Date": "July 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Digital Camera", "Author": "\"romanks\"", "ReviewID": "R2TL6M4353TPN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Camera is GREAT! -- Very nice quality pictures, 6x optical zoom, very nice design -- I Love It.I bought a MiMh reacharable battery by Telepower,... plus a charger ...- it lasts me for almost 200 shots.

You need to press the shutter half way down to focus but it is a nice feature for me since if the lense is covered in the photography mode, the camera does not try to focus on nothing which bothers me a lot when I was using a olympus with aoto focus.

This camera seems great -- affordable, awesome optical zoom, and compact -- but there are more than a few problems with it.First of all, if you're in a room with soft lighting, the LCD is pitch black.  I tried adjusting the LCD brightness, but it didn't help.  You need to be in a VERY well-lit area to even be able to see what you're taking a picture of, otherwise (I kid you not) it's pitch black.  You end up getting pieces of people's heads instead of a full scene shot.The software installation went just fine, except when I connected the camera to my Pentium 4 running Windows 2000Pro, my computer crashed.  It didn't just crash, though -- it locked down so I couldn't end programs to properly shut down my computer.In case battery life is a concern, it's important to note that the FinePix 2800 runs on 4 AA batteries.  Fuji sells rechargable mAh batteries, but they're VERY expensive ($60 for a 4-pack), and I don't even know how much the charger costs.I was also disappointed with the bundle that comes with the camera.  You get a neck strap -- woo hoo! -- but no case.  I had a lot of trouble finding a case that fit the camera, since the zoom lens bulges out.

I wanted something compatible with the Smart Media cards I already had from an earlier Fuji camera. The 2 MP file size is ideal, giving an perfect balance of image quality and quantity. Pluses:Shape of the camera -- fits in the hands like a conventional 35mm SLR camera (although smaller). This is helpful for those who are used to using 35mm cameras and don't adapt well to some of the funky new digital camera shapes that are available today. Also can be held with one hand if desired.6X Lens -- Great range, allowing for perfectly framed pictures of most subjects.Simplicity -- not much here to complicate matters.EVF -- it is nice to know you will be taking an image of exactly what you frame up in the view finder, however...Minuses:Low light performance of EVF -- There is no way around it, the Electronic View Finder does not function well in low light (like during an evening wedding reception). Leave the camera on a wide angle, point and shoot, and review the image. Repeat as necessary.Lens cover leash is too short -- When the camera is turned on the lens extends out a bit. The lens cover leash can get caught around the corner of the camera body, inhibiting the lens from extending during startup.Auto focus \"freeze frame\" -- When depressing the \"shutter\" slightly the camera auto focuses on the subject inside of two yellow brackets in the EVF. The camera freezes the image for a split second, temporarily blinding you from your subject. If your subject has moved you will have to re-focus. This has an up side to it though -- the freeze frame gives you a split second to review the part of the image the camera is focused on. As long as you don't let up on the \"shutter\" button the camera will remained focused on that part of the subject. This allows you to focus on subjects that aren't in the middle of the frame, by pointing the camera and locking the auto focus directly at the part of the image you want as the primary subject, and then reframing the image so you subject isn't always in the dead center. This makes for good picture composition.Overall, this is a great value in the ever changing world of digital cameras.", "Date": "September 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "great buy for the money", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2JWOKHK1WY918", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been shopping the Nikon 775 when a ritz camera salesman pointed this out.

As a bit of background, I have been shooting and developing my own 35mm film for the past 29 years (strictly as a hobbyist), shooting mostly with older, manual-focus Olympus and Canon SLR's. I purchased both this camera and the Canon Powershot A40 from Amazon in the summer of 2002.  I definitely prefer the Fuji.  Why? 1) Superior optics (in my humble opinion).  I shot dozens of pics  of the same subject matter, at the same distance, with the same  focal length and lighting within seconds of each other in order  to compare the results side-by-side.  The Fuji pics were in all  cases noticably sharper and more accurately exposed.  Colors  with the Fuji were also more accurate, and with better  saturation.  Shadow details are better w/the Fuji also.2) Macro capabilites.  The Fuji's focusing distance in macro mode  is closer than that of the Canon A40 and again, the Fuji  produced sharper, more accurately exposed pics.3) Focal length.  The Fuji wins hands down with a 6x optical zoom  versus the Canon's 3x optical zoom.4) Ease of use.  Again, the Fuji has the edge.  Simpler operation  (especially for novices and casual users)than the Canon, though  admittedly lacking some of the Canon's more advanced features/  options.Don't get me wrong, the Canon Powershot A40 is a decent camera and offers manual operation, which the Fuji does not (albiet in a somewhat limited manner with only a couple of shutter speeds available when shooting manually).  I would also say that the Canon's low-light, night shot capabilities are superior to those of the Fuji as long as you're using a tripod.  Canon's photo stitch technology is also a nice touch for super-wide panorama shots.  Those pluses aside, I feel the Fuji FinePix 2800 is the overall superior camera for the reasons I have stated above and should be on your short list if you're looking for a simple to use, point-and-shoot digital camera capable of taking razor-sharp pics at a reasonable price.

Maybe, 3-5M camera is sure better considering the resolution while they often require more dollars. I think pay 250--350$ for top-level 2M digital camera is a good idea because our printer today is in such a level. One who need higher resolution may buy this one now and buy another 3-5M camera in next year, ---- I think totally you pay the same money for 2 cameras compared with buying one 3-5M camera today.Further more, a 3M camera with 3x optical will down to 2M or even less resolution if it has to use digital zoom while 2800 can keep its 2M level with 6x Opt.zoom.

The most important feature in my book was the 6X optical zoom. The auto focus is right on and the pre-focus option, (holding the shutter button down halfway) is a nice touch. One of my friends was so impressed with mine that he ordered one yesterday, (and Amazon still has the best price). I must say that although the camera is everything I hoped it would be there are a couple minor details that can be a little bothersome. I find that it is difficult to take action shots while using the zoom. Much like a Single Lens Reflex camera, when the shutter is released the viewfinder goes black (something I hadn't considered) so it is nearly impossible to track a moving target. With some practice however I found that with good lighting the photos are crisp and clear. As long as the camera is kept still, it performs well in low light conditions and the flash is more than adequate. I don't care for the software but that is just my opinion.I suggest that you buy  a 128 MB card and some high capacity Nickel Metal Hydride batteries and charger. I used this camera every last week and I haven't changed them yet.

The electronic viewfinder and the LCD came out very dark, almost to the point that you couldn't see what it was you were taking a picture of. No matter how much light I added, it wasn't enough. Oddly, it did not suffer under flourescent light (I found out when I went to the store to see if it was just my camera or what). Since I bought a digital camera to use primarily for snapshot purposes, I needed it to be suitable in snapshot conditions. To its credit, the pictures turned out fine with the flash and even with a little longer exposure, but not being able to see clearly what I was shooting in the beginning was very frustrating. The electronic viewfinder doesn't leave you with any way to get around the darkness, as a glass viewfinder would. The problem with the dark scenes was too much for me. I returned this camera and opted for one with a glass viewfinder to be safe!

It can take pictures of sunsets that are absolutely amazing.

The pictures still come out okay, but you have to see them after taking the picture.  The size and shape of the camera took some getting used to but I absolutely love it now....

This was my third digital camera, and I returned it because although the prints were beautiful and clear, and I loved the zoom, it wasn't worth sacrificing my compositions for. I played with all the controls to try and adjust, but the only solution was either a tripod or bring your own lighting. I exchanged it for a Canon and am very pleased with it. It has less features and zoom, but at least I can set my picture up the way I want it, the first time.

Some of the review had me worried about certain aspects of the camera, but I went ahead and bought it.I was VERY pleasantly surprised when I recieved the camera. The 6x zoom works very well, and the camera is a joy to use. It's not perfect, but the features (and price) far outweigh the negatives for me.Pluses:- 6x Zoom- Great color and image.- USB camera port works flawlessly with Linux for image transfer.- 60 second movies with sound.  This is the one that surprised me. I knew about the ability  to take short movies, but the reality is much better than  than I thought it would be. It reminds me of the old  Super8 home movies my grandparents used to take.Minuses: - No active autofocus. Autofocus doesn't do well in low light.- Lenscap instead of door to protect lens.- LCD viewfinder. Actually, it works pretty well, even in lowishlight situations, if you turn up the brightness setting. I had many more problems with the autofocus. But the viewfinder does take getting used to, and the pause in the viewfinder screen during autofocus is a bit annoying.I haven't had any problems with it eating batteries, since I bought some good high capacity NiMH rechargables. The camera is somewhat short and squat which makes finding a camera bag challenging, but it is comfortable to hold due to a nice right hand grip.All in all, it's a great little camera at a great price. The 6x zoom and image quality is worth the price, and the mini-camcorder feature is just icing on the cake.

My first digital was a FujiFilm FinePix A201, with only a 2.5 digital zoom and 2 mp, great for starters but I really didn't like any of the pictures taken with it.

I like the 35 mm-style casing, it makes it look like a much more expensive camera, and of course FujiFilm's very simple to use menus.  The interface with my computer is quick and painless and I had a beautiful shot, from shutter to printed copy, in less than 5 minutes.  My only complaint so far has been the delayed shutter speed, not very good for taking pics of animals that don't stay still long, but I can live with this.

I will always give thumbs up for Fuji film for its picture quality, no matter the MP limit.I will have to say, even though this camera is small and cute, its not meant for putting in your pocket or shirt pocket (unless you want this big lump on your chest).

The USB connection to the PC and the nice all-around FinePix software that this camera comes with, allows me to do that with no hassles. The software also can e-mail photos directly, and it automatically makes the photos a manageable file size for attachments. So, for example, a 300kb photo will e-mail as a 80kb photo and still retain great quality in the e-mail.I was also looking for a camera that had decent optical zoom capability because we are often outdoors and I like the flexibility of close-in as well as wide shots. This camera has a very capable 6X optical zoom which I have enjoyed using.Finally, as any parent of young children knows, it is really difficult to get them to sit still. This camera offers a 60-second video capability, which has often come in handy to capture my kids at play or doing something silly.I have received a lot of compliments on the camera's images.Some minor drawbacks - in dark conditions, the camera has trouble picking out images to auto-focus on. I get around this by pointing it a nearby light source that is roughly the same distance to the camera as my subject. In addition, there can be a maddening 1 to 2 second delay in capturing and saving an image. But you learn to live with it - and sometimes what you clicked on is not what you get in the image, but you get used to that, and many times the image you got is better than the original.

Neither does the Lumix take such good indoor fotos as the FujiPix. I suspect the reason for the difference lies in the lens, the larger Fujinon being way superior to the Panasonic Lumix Leica lens. The FujiPix is limited by lack of a wide angle lens 2MP max, although I still wonder how it takes such true colour high resolution fotos at this level.

The only down fall on the camera, is taking photos in low light situations, it is difficult to see what you want to capture, but when you snap and look at it, wow, it is a whole new world, the photo is clear, crisp and so bright. I have taken wedding photos and get some great close up shots with the zoom, so much so the bride and groom are usually amazed with the quality and how great the Zoom works. Because if how amazed people usually are with the shots, I have started to give photos on a CD as a wedding gift, and guess what, it is a hit, everyone loves it, and I at times capture what the photographer that they hired missed. Also with this little beast of a camera, persons have asked me to take photos and they will pay me, yes for this 2 MP camera. Macros work great for the close ups and the flash is excellent.

I get compliments all the time from people who sees the prints it makes, and when I let people borrow my camera, they always like it. I bought this camera when it 1st came out, and paid $400+ for it. Even at that price, I have no regrets whatsoever about purchasing this gem of a camera. It is a perfect size, and takes beautiful pictures. I bought it mostly because it has a through-the-lens viewfinder, but I also enjoy all of the many features I wasn't even expecting. The macro feature is super. My home printer is not great, so when I want really good prints I take my memory card to my local Kit's Camera. The prints I get back are not grainy at all - they look just as good or better than the pics I take with my old Nikon 35mm SLR. It is fully automatic, but also has manual overrides if you want to use them. The auto settings are usually great unless you're doing something artistic. You can even take pics indoors, and they will not look yellow. I take pictures of architectural models indoors, so a colorbalance feature was important for me. VERY easy to use - much easier than most other digital cameras out there. You should also get a battery charger - it will save you money in the long run (only negative point about camera is that it goes through batteries quickly). I also bought a card reader, and it makes transferring the pics to my computer really easy. Card readers go for $20 at any electronics store, and plug into a usb port. I think this camera is worth every penny I paid for it. I reccomend this model to anyone who wants the convenience of a digital and the clarity of a traditional 35mm SLR.

Create new folders each time you download a card of images.
