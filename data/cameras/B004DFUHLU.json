{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not a quality product", "Author": "J. Rudolph", "ReviewID": "R3CH16LC5JI7G9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this device for a customer who needed an inexpensive CCTV setup for a bar. Nothing fancy, didn't expect high video quality or anything of the sort. Well, when the item arrived, and i found out my customer did not have a working cdrom on her computer, we tried looking for the software to run this thing online. Upon close inspection of the packaging, i could find no useful information on who exactly manufactures this product or a part number, so i could not pursue that any further.We eventually got the software onto the customer's computer by other means, and set up the camera system. Each of the cameras was approximately 20 feet from the receiver. The packaging boasts a range of 100 meters, and that was a patent lie. At 20 FEET, the pictures were not of a quality that could be useful for anything. As a matter of fact, the cameras performed better on the 9 volt batteries than with the ac-adapter. This indicates to me that there is poor quality electronics in the ac adapter not properly conditioning the signal for use as a dc power source, and the ac noise was interfering with the RF transmission of the cameras. The product is not usable for any purpose i can think of with such limited range.I know this is not a review of the seller, but I would like to point out, however, that the sellers customer service was impeccable and the RMA process went through very smoothly. If you are willing to take a chance on such a low quality product, you can at least rely on the seller to refund your money in a timely manner when you change your mind.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004DFUHLU"}}
