{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent IP Camera", "Author": "SGELET \"SueJohn\"", "ReviewID": "RV0IVSBA94PXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This IP Security camera is worth the extra money compared to other IP cameras with similar features. It really is plug and play with the ethenet cable. Had a little trouble setting up the wireless function only because we use a wireless N router. After we configured the router to b/g settings and used WPA2-PSK(aes) security settings it worked perfectly.No need for an IP service such as TZO. This camera gets the IP address dynamically which saves some expense compared to some IP cams that need the IP service.Viewing remotely works excellent and the software is very easy to use. Motion detection works great. Haven't used the scheduling feature yet.I would definitely recommend this camera for ease of setup and simplicity of operation.The only thing I would change is the mounting hardware. It is more for vertical attachment rather than a horizontal surface, which is what I need. But it can be adapted for that situation by mounting it to board at an angle which suits your needs.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera, very easy to set up", "Author": "Kenneth R. Schaefer", "ReviewID": "R23HN9HGEMKAR5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great IP camera.  The claim that this is essentially plug and play is true. Instillation was very easy. I have dabbled with several IP cameras and have found the settings required for the router to be very difficult, at least for me. This camera eliminates that issue.  The picture clarity is as good as with any camera I have experience with. There also customized settings.  The documentation is good except for remote viewing. This may have been an oversight on my part but it was not obvious to me. If you should have the same difficulty the URL for the Internet browser is [[...]].  This camera works very well on my iphone in 3G.  You must load an app (mCamView).  The app is free for the light version.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible in so many ways", "Author": "Brian Hill", "ReviewID": "R1VRMJ5M5JFJBO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, here are the pros:- Basic wired network setup was relatively quick and painless- Night vision is OK- Comes with mounting hardware- Seller was very easy to work with on refundNow, here are all of the negatives:- Proprietary video format that cannot be read by anything but the junky bundled software- HORRIBLE video quality (think late 80's camcorder on the highest quality settings)- Could not get it to work with WPA2/TKIP (and I am a networking professional)- SAN recording feature is not well documented (need to use NetBIOS name to connect)- No error logging that I could find, and the displayed error messages are worthless (\"Could not connecting to device\" is pretty typical)- Typical Chinese budget electronics quality- Poor instructions- No support whatsoever from the manufacturer- EXPENSIVEI actually bought this because it was so highly rated, which was a mistake. I returned it and replaced it with a D-Link DCS-1130 and could not be more pleased.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for the money", "Author": "Peters_rating \"peter\"", "ReviewID": "RJ13R464O6JC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am using the camera to watch for my second home. The camera is working know for 3 month without problems. I was worrying about the wireless connection but so far I was always able to connect. Sometimes I have to initialize the connection twice before it works. The picture quality is decent if there is enough light. I have a display with temperature and humidity close to the camera. I am able to read the numbers and see if things are okay. Details may be not good enough for identifying people's faces unless they pose in front of the camera.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "too complicated", "Author": "Richard Y", "ReviewID": "R2PTUDZ8TOM0EK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You really need more than basic knowledge of your wifi network settings. this is not a plug n play device.
