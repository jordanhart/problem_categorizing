We had to replace the batteries and that wiped the camera clean. We lost all of her field trip pictures.The second time the camera got jostled in her backpack and the batteries popped out. Pictures gone. Finally I took 18 pictures to test it and made sure the batteries were NOT removed. The next morning every picture was gone. I've gotten better results from a $6 phone from Walgreens. I strongly discourage everyone from buying this phone UNLESS you take joy in talking your kid off the ledge every time she touches the camera. How do they get away with making such shoddy products?", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "disappointing", "Author": "jjibrous", "ReviewID": "R16B4Y0HZTWR9Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a very cheap camera.
