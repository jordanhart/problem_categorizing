It's tiny and, above all, really easy to use. Unlike my previous 5 MP digicam, the Sony DP-10, which had a gaggle of complicated features and was had a learning curve to take good pictures, the X60's operations are intuitive. The manual is available and really easy to understand too if you need to read it.Pros:Small, compact, truly a purse camera if you wanted. Others that claim to be small aren't really but this one is!Fast start up. Just slide the cover and it's on.Easy to operateGood picture qualityNice big LCD screenCovered lensInternal 15MB memoryCons.No viewfinder (Not like I use that anyway)Zoom is only standard.I've heard that the LCD in previous models in this line are fragile. I've had no problems so far but you're not supposed to drop a digicam anyway.My first digicam was a minolta 3.2 MP which I lose in Kyoto and I'm glad I went back to a brand I like.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Compared to the X50 it's smaller, sleeker, better, & cheaper!", "Author": "Navid", "ReviewID": "R1HX9BQOC9DXOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the Konica Minolta X50 (see my review on it), which ended up being defective after about 9 months of normal, delicate use.  The battery cover wouldn't stay shut anymore, so back to Costco it went.After researching the \"ultra-compact\" cameras in the 5.0mp and above class, I found that the minor improvements of the x60, coupled with the larger LCD display and lower price made it the most appealing digital \"ultra\" compact in the entire category.  I mean I put it up against Sony's DSC T-1/T-7/and T-3, Kodak's new EasyShare V-50, Casio's Exilim Z750 and EX-S500, Fuji's FinePix Z1, Olympus, and Pentax Optio.It came out the winner.  I'll give it 1 year of use and revisit my review to give another update.In the meantime, if compact is what you're looking for, this camera will meet those objectives plus take excellent snap shots in well lit close range situations.The only thing that remains to be a weak point, is the poor flash range and the poor resolution of pictures in low-light situations.  If you're taking night photos, you need to be within the 6 feet and in an area where you're picking up some light, otherwise your subject shot will come out blurry, out of focus, or over exposed.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Hern S. Chen", "ReviewID": "R322EKBLA3AESI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After purchased two little Canon SD200 cameras for my daughters, I decided to upgrade my own bulky first generation HP camera (2M, no optical zoom).I wanted a 4M/5M ultra compact camera and had my eye set on newer Canon SD camera.  However, I don't want to pay too much for the camera so I ended up looking for non Canon SD cameras.One of the consideration I have is that I don't want a camera with proprietary memory (so Sony is out) or semi-proprietary memory (I considered xD a proprietary after reading that the panorama mode for some Olympus camera only works with Olympus's own xD card).Finally, I settled on Minolta X60 after some research.  I am quite happy with the camera - it is very small, the 2.5\" LCD is quite big (no viewfinder though), the control is quite logical, and the picture quality is pretty good.  The battery life of about 150 pictures is not quite enough for a long trip but you can pick up non-OEM batteries for a few dollars.The 15MB internal memory is not accessible when an external memory card is plug in.  However, it may come handy when you forget your SD card.", "Date": "September 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "The best camera for size and cost.", "Author": "David Impson \"D.

The x60 has a great design.  Very easy to use and stylish.  I really like the internal optical zoom.  The size, weight, battery life, and scene modes are all pluses.Cons: low light comes out eithe over exposed with the flash, or blurry.  Hard to get good shots indoors.

Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "R8JLOURYXW79L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the mighty Dimage 7 for almost four years. I expect to own it another ten. I feel about it much the same way my father felt about his Hasselblad. It is a quality instrument that may get old but always rewards you when you use it properly.The Dimage 7 is big though and as I have previously opined there are times you want to throw a camera in your pocket rather than lug a camera bag. This little 5MP point and shoot is just that...little. How little? Smaller than a Blackberry, certainly.I bought this to replace a Minolta Dimage F300, another 5MP point and shoot. The pictures favorably compare to the F300's, but it is no match for the Dimage 7. This is mainly because the latter has a great lens that lets amateurs sparkle if they bother to compose shots with any degree of thought.But this camera like the larger F300 before it gives quality results whose inherent limitations can be edited with Photoshop to simulate a better camera. So having a point and shoot with you can let you take a picture when that unexpected opportunity presents itself.OK limitations...once again the controls are electronic so they are not as flexible or intuitive as on the bigger camera. For instance on the Dimage 7 if you want to use the flash you flip it up. If you don't you leave it down. Here you have to reset the controls to suppress the flash.Secondly, there is no viewfinder. But the LCD is 2.5 inches and the camera is tiny. You probably wouldn't use a viewfinder if you had one.Third the battery. Its rechargable. But there is only one. I ordered three more so I can always have charged spares, a strategy I use with the big camera. The F300 used rechargeable AAs but it had a relatively cheap long lasting lithium battery that that made it possible to ignore battery issues when you took it out of the house. On the plus side for the new toy is that just one NP700 battery operates the camera so having a spare or two with you is not a big deal.", "Date": "September 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "great alternative to sony", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R1RLCXE2Z0L4TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a month and it has been an exceptional performer compared to my friends sony dsc-t7 (the latest small 5 megapixel from sony).  Except for the sony's video-capturing capabilities, the Dimage x60 is marginally better then the sony.  Aside from being less expensive, the sd cards for the x60 can be purchased for a lot less then sony proprietary pro duo sticks that the sony camera needs.When using the Konica Minolta x60, it is better to put it in manual mode where you can select a mode according to the type of picture you want to take.  These modes range from portrait to night time shot and more.  You can use auto, but manual mode will give you better results according to what you select.Overall, this camera is a great upgrade from the Konica Minolta Dimage x60 as well as an excellent choice among ultra-compact cameras such as the Sony, the Casio, and the Fuji brands.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Point and shoot at its purest", "Author": "lordhoot \"lordhoot\"", "ReviewID": "R1NQI3R3O8JPFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After some researched, I brought the Kinica Minolta X60 to served as my backup to my Canon S2 IS. X60 is a small, slim and lightweight camera that is perfect for a quick photo almost anywhere because you can stick this camera almost anywhere on you.This camera is almost a purest high quality point and shoot camera you can buy with your money. Everything on it is on automatic modes of one sort or another. There are nine modes including the automatic which actually decide which mode is best for the photo. Most of the modes can be found in most digital cameras like \"sports\" or \"landscape\". A child can take a good shot with this camera and it is near perfect for any beginner who walk into the digital camera age with their eyes shut.There are few small things you can do to adjust and adapt your camera each shot. White balance can be adjusted, ISO from 50-400 can be adjusted, drive mode can be adjusted and other minor features that this camera come packed with. There is even an \"anti-shake\" indictor if your shutter speed is too slow and your hand is shaking too much. Use a tripod says the computer. The camera also come with a movie mode which is pretty basic as well.The housing of this camera appears to be hard plastic with a metal feel. It seem to be well built. The large 2.5 inch LCD screen seem to be most vulnerable to damage and this may be the camera's only physical weak link. Proper care and attention would be needed, a good camera case for example is a must. The large 2.5 LCD is very nice. But remembered that it serves as your viewscreen for all your shooting. The controls are bit on the small sizes. There is no way you can handled the controls of this camera with gloves for example. People with long fingernails will have an easier time then people without.The camera unfortunately, is not powered by AA batteries but by NP-700 ion battery. It got a decent life to it but I would encourage anyone buying this camera to buy couple more for back up. Buy it from a third party since Minolta overcharged for their NP-700 outragously. On the other side, X60 uses SD cards for its storage.The software that come with your camera is pretty decent sort. Some people will used it and others will not. It pretty subjective.Overall, this is a very good camera that should meet the needs of most point and shoot crowds. The small size and weight allowed it be taken almost anywhere. Only danger to that is that you might even forget that you have it with you. The camera appears to be very reliable, somewhat rugged and shoot well. This is a computer driven camera and basically all you have to worry about is point and shoot!", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fragile LCD...Terrible customer service", "Author": "Scott Fraser \"ntscott2\"", "ReviewID": "R1NXDM2HFN144B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did a fair amount of research before purchasing the Dimage x60. As far as form factor, I like it. The picture quality is good.On my very first day of use the LCD fractured internally. It never left my hand or protective case. I took 15 pictures before it no longer worked.When I contacted Konica Minolta customer service by phone, the seemed helpful. I really wanted to get it fixed by Christmas so on Dec 1st, to expedite the warranty repair I paid $39 for UPS Next Day Air. I called 2 weeks later to check status of the repair. They couldnt find it. The holidays came and went with no camera. To make a long story short, they never contacted me so I expected to receive it any day. In February, still no camera. I called again and they told me that I damaged the LCD. If I wanted it fixed that I would have to pay $147. I emphatically disagreed and they asked if I wanted to talk with a manager...YES I DO! I just kept going from voicemail to voicemail.Never again will I give a company $1 that doesnt stand behind their product. I've had a Sony DSC for 5 years with NO PROBLEMS at all.

My fiance and I have this digital camera and have taken thousands of photos with it and have been very satisfied with the camera.We love taking pictures, especially of beautiful scenery from our travels. We often post our photos online for family and friends and consistently receive compliments on the quality and color depth of the pictures. You can see some of our travel photos and judge for yourself at GoSightsee.com.The camera is very lightweight, making it easy to carry in a purse or pocket. We recommend getting a carrying case that clips onto your belt or pants to protect the preview screen from getting scratched. This is the one that we like: Konica Minolta Deluxe Case for Dimage X, Xi, XG, X31, X50 & X60 Digital Cameras The camera case is black and has a magnetic button clasp. You can carry an extra memory card in it as well. It's worth the few extra dollars to keep your camera in good condition for years to come.The Konica Minolta DiMage camera is very small and sleek and looks cool. People even ask us about our camera while we're taking pictures! The preview screen is large compared to the size of the camera. We also liked that it came with a rechargeable battery (which charges fully in about an hour).I highly recommend this digital camera!", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "THE PERFECT COMPACT CAMERA", "Author": "Brianna D. Musgrave", "ReviewID": "R2Y60PU46JO6TD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched extensively before I purchased this camera.  I read every professional and customer review I could.  I compared features, sizes, prices, ratings, everything.  I checked out the cameras in stores and online.  Based on all of that info I finally decided on the Konica Minolta X60 5MP.  After using the camera on an almost daily basis for several months now I am happy to say that I made the right choice. I already had the HP photosmart  935  5.3MP which takes amazing photos, but it's fairly slow and it devours batteries.  Also it is a more average sized camera.  I wanted to continue using that camera for the more important, planned photos and special shots like fireworks and such.  I wanted a second camera that was as compact as possible, easy and fast to use, with a large LCD display.  I also wanted it to take great pictures without costing me a fortune. I couldn't be happier with the X60.  It is even smaller and more streamlined than it seems in photos, but the LCD is huge with very clear images.  It is so fast that I can turn it on and off repeatedly to save battery life, but I don't really need to because it has such outstanding battery life.  The sliding lens cover / power switch works wonderfully and it prevents the camera from turning on in your pocket, purse or case.  Plus it doesn't have a bothersome telescoping lens to worry about and the zoom is great.  It has every function and photo option that regular camera users could want with really easy to use buttons and menus.  The buttons and lenses are all so perfectly situated that I never smudge my LCD or stick my finger over the lens.  It is durable and obviously well made.  I carry it in my purse every day in a super slim case without a single problem.  I take so many more pictures now than I ever did before I bought the X60.  The pictures are so beautiful!  Always clear and crisp.  A lot of the small cameras have problems with blurring because they are harder to hold still.  Unless you are bouncing or shaking unreasonably for some strange reason, blurry pictures aren't a problem with the X60.I adore this camera.  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "April 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Adam Caron", "ReviewID": "R3PWCWOBC332I2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll preface this by saying that I'm reviewing this from the perspective of 2011 at a price far far below the MSRP of $299. I bought it as a compact alternative to the newly purchased Sony A330 DSLR which is a decent camera but rather unwieldy for casual shooting. I also have a Sony DSC-P1 point and shoot, but was trying to get away from shutter lag, as well as wanting to use an EYE-FI card.I selected the X50 as my desired purchase based mostly of the claims of a .08 second shutter lag and .5 second startup time. I ended up buying the x60 instead as a number of reviews I read complained of the LCD on the x50 being a crapshoot as far as durability. Also, I wanted a camera that used SD cards and was compatible with an EYE-FI card for wireless uploading (which the A330 is not, nor is my Sony point and shoot DSC-P1.)Here is the summary:+ Very compact, all the photos I see online make it look much larger than it really is. It is quite tiny.+ Compatible with the EYE-FI line of cards as mentioned, though only the 2GB SD cards, not the later SDHC. 2GB is plenty for a 5MP point and shoot though. [Note: I've found that if you take a large number of photos in a burst, the card has trouble keeping up with the transfers before the camera powers down the card slot. I have to hit the buttons a few times to get them all to transfer. I assume this is a common issue with any camera not \"Eye-Fi\" aware.](neutral) Photo quality is decent, though nothing to write home about. The Carl Zeiss lens on the Sony DSC-P1 is clearly better capable of focusing at the same 5MP, though it is probably unfair to compare as the two as the x60 has a non-protruding periscope style lens. This is a nice low-profile feature that I prefer. Also, the images have noticeable noise in anything other than full daylight. Not really any worse than the average compact Point-and-shot but no better than average either.+ Zoom speed is fairly fast from wide to telephoto, though focus lags behind by a second of so.+ As mentioned, has a periscope style lens that allows it to stay low-profile and zoom fast. 3x zoom is fairly standard and usable for this class.- Battery life is rather poor. Even with a brand-new battery I can't seem to get more than about 60-70 photos before it dies (with flash going for all of them.)- Autofocus is fairly slow in anything other than full outside daylight. Indoors even with all lights on it is very sluggish at focusing. Likely due to the lack of an AF lamp. It can take up to a full second to find focus, sometimes even longer in very poor lighting. Maybe I'm biased by having a DSLR also.+ Start-up time is fast, though not quite as fast as the propaganda claims. Same thing for shutter lag - quite fast and better than most, but not as fast as claimed. Better than the DSC-P1 on both counts though. Shutdown is very fast.+ User friendly and simple to navigate. Fast preview and menu changing also. All buttons havea nice feel, nothing flimsy about them.+ Rugged construction has a nice sturdy feel. I like the sliding lens door that acts as the switch. It would be nicer if there was some protection for the screen, but you can't have everything. Card slot and USB connection has a nice sliding cover door.+ Standard USB connection, not proprietary. Not that I ever use a cord anyways, but I still appreciate the thought.- doesn't recharge via USB, must use the stand-alone charger.- When you pull the battery out, all settings are lost which is quite annoying, particularly because one of the settings is JPEG quality which, astonishingly isn't Fine by default.+ Shot to shot speed and flash recharge are both reasonably fast.Overall, for the price paid it is an excellent semi-disposable, convenient camera for quick snapshots and I don't have to worry about lugging around a huge bulky camera, I don't need to do anything to transfer my photos to the computer other than shoot them, and it is reasonably fast and clear. It serves me well for the exact purpose I bought it for, though at it's original price of $300 list, I think I would have been disappointed, even by the 2006 standards at the time. For a bargain basement price though, I am very pleased with it and really couldn't ask for much more.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "WONDERFUL CAMERA/Minolta X60", "Author": "SONNY SCAFF \"SONNY SCAFF\"", "ReviewID": "R3B0DYQENSZTTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...LIGHT WEIGHT AND COMPACT.
