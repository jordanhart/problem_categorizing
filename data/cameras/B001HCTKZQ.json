It will shoot 9 megapixel stills, up to 7 megapixel stills at the incredibly fast rate of 40fps, HD 720p video, and slow motion video ranging from 30-1000fps.  It also has a 20x zoom (although I find the zoom to be only slightly longer than my Canon S3 IS \"12x zoom\", but the wide angle is much wider).The camera is very easy to setup and use, although I am still trying to figure out some of the more advanced features (like the ability for the camera to automatically take photos when an object enters the frame).Image quality is pretty good, about the same as my Canon S3 IS.  It does much deeper blues and reds than the Canon, and doesn't have as bad chromatic aberration, but it's greens are a little too blue for my taste, and the off-whites need some more yellow.  Noise isn't as high as I expected, but do realize this is not a DSLR, it's a small lens and a small sensor.Lighting seems to be key with this camera.  In direct sunlight, it takes amazing photos and videos, but in low-light, the high speed videos begin to suffer.  I haven't had any that I took under normal lighting conditions come out unusable, but a few that I took in a very dim office nearly are.My only complaints are minor, but here they are:When shooting video, even with continuous AF off, it will still occasionally try to refocus, I find this very annoyingI cannot seem to find the settings to turn on move-in CS (motion-sensor triggers the camera)While the latest firmware drastically improved write speeds for video, shooting single stills seems to take a long time to write to my class 6 memory cardI really don't like the proprietary USB connection, it is very difficult to find the right angle to get it to plug in because it's so narrowPleasant surprises:Unlike the S3 IS, it remembers your photo and video settings very well, and if you set photos to manual focus and then want to take a video, the video will \"pick up\" that setting as wellThe big 3\" screen on the back is beautiful, with the Canon I mostly used the viewfinder, not so with the CasioStartup time is faster than I expected based on other reviews, from power on to first shot isn't noticeably longer than the S3 ISThe flash is very bright and VERY fast, up to 5fpsEditing videos on the camera is ridiculously easy, hands down the best video editing GUI I've seen on a camera, makes it very easy to just keep the part of the video you wantBuild quality is very good, I especially like the rubberized grip, it's much more secure than the Canon, and easier to hold despite it's heavier weightI'll post a further review after I've spent some more time with it, and hopefully a few of my little quibbles will be fixed in upcoming firmware.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "Christopher Mcintyre", "ReviewID": "RLBTTX79OFZVX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This thing is like a beefed up point-and-shoot.

The picture gets really dark. My old casio (pocket point-and-shoot) used to have a best shot selection that corrected this, but I can't find it on this camera.If you want to take pictures of you kid playing soccer, this is a great camera.

The SLO-MO is my personal favorite, well, that and the burst mode. While it does have brilliant stills, the video is amazing to shoot with. I love the 30-210 fps mode because it shows the drastic difference between regular speed (which is brilliant already) to slow motion, which really seems like you're entering a wrinkle in time, seriously.Yesterday I went to a gymnastics meet, and wow, did it blow my mind. Being able to look back and see the girls hurdling down toward the vault at normals speed (which sincerely looks like fast forwarding) and then click right over to 210 mid-shot for some mid air hang time. I can't even believe how gorgeous it is. I'm pretty sure I'm a cinematographer right now, and I won't stop!!I am actually using this camera for work, as I'm working on marketing, and even while it's my job to hype it - I LOVE it just as a p&s; camera and easy video, for my own personal use.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just what I had been looking for!", "Author": "Lost in Anaheim", "ReviewID": "R22O3CJZTT99RZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted this camera to take pics of my daughter's basketball games, but my Nikon could not capture the \"action\" shots I wanted. To be fair though, I did not have a lens fast enough to capture the pics I wanted, and I did not want to spend a $1000+ to get one.I saw a camera similar to this reviewed in the NYT by David Pogue, and was very interested since from his video demo it seemed like I could finally capture the pics that I wanted. After much research, and indecision I finally decided to bite the bullet. I received it Friday, I took it to my daughter's practice this weekend, and WOW, I have pictures that I could never have taken before. I can capture the shot of when the ball is just leaving my daughter's hand for a lay up, and she, the ball, and the basket are all in perfect focus caught just at that fraction of the second like you see in magazines. The 40 fps is amazing, and when you review the pics, it looks like those flip books that they use to sell at Disneyland. I like to take pics, but I am not the best photographer, with 40 (or 30,15, 10 whatever you want to set the fps at)even I can capture the shot I want.The pics are sharp not DSLR sharp, but pretty darn good! Previously when I use to take pics, I would get blurred images, but now, I can see everything, its like that fraction of second captured.The down side of this camera is that it can take a few seconds to write those 40 pictures to your card, and theoretically I could miss that next picture while waiting, but I have so many other pictures now that I CAN use, it doesn't matter as much as I thought it might.The high speed video, and slow mo work as promised, and are a lot of fun. I haven't played a lot with it since I am more interested in the still side of the camera. What I have played with though is pretty amazing.Some of the negative reviews that I have seen on the internet seem to slam the camera because there is a softness in the picture quality on some shots, but they seem to be comparing this camera to a DSLR which technically it isn't. For what I want it for - action shots of kids (basketball and gymnastics), plus casual pictures this camera is GREAT!This camera does eat through the batteries, so rechargables are my next purchase.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "THE camera for sports analysis", "Author": "Bob Areddy", "ReviewID": "R2Z57VA7KRVM03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been filming my golf swing since since 2004 with a standard Canon 30fps camera, and while it gave me great results for so long, it was time to upgrade when this model came out.Yes, golf is my game, and this camera fits the bill perfectly.  While it's not a very good still camera (my 3 year old 5meg Canon is much better), there is no other option for high speed recording.The Casio takes pictures at 480x360 at 210 fps, which is the typical resolution I record at.  Once in a while I mess around with 1000fps (like taking a nice close-up of the ball... fantastic for sand shots), but in reality, 210fps is what you want.  You need a fair amount of light to record at 210fps, as you MUST have your shutter speed faster than that (for obvious reasons).  The Fh-20 forces a minimum shutter speed based on your frame rate.  If I recall correctly, 1/250 is required for 210fps.I very much recommend the Fh-20 over the fc100, because you can manually adjust the shutter speed, while the FC-100 takes it's best guess.  You can also adjust the ISO with the FH-20.  So in lower light conditions, you can jack up the ISO (while getting a grainier picture), but keep the shutter speed at a fast enough speed to get a decent picture.In good lighting conditions, you'll want the shutter speed at 1/2000 or faster.  I generally keep it at 1/5000 during the summer in full sunlight.  I've messed around with 1/20000, but there's really no point.You then record to a memory card, and you can then play back on the camera.  For a golf swing, I generally don't record more than 3 swings at a time, as it takes too long to fast forward through the swing.  You can then trim the video to one swing, or get rid of the extra meaningless video.  The Casio has pretty good playback ability on the camera itself, and the display is bright enough in full sunlight.  I don't even bring my laptop to the range anymore.As far as swing analysis, I then copy the videos to my laptop later and can view them with analysis software.  About the only limitation is that when you record in 210fps, you cannot play back at 210fps.  Therefore your videos will ALWAYS be in slow motion.The lens is pretty wide, so you can set the camera up very close to the subject and get it in frame.  Great for those tight quarters at the driving range.  Of course, the closer the camera, the more parallax error there is in the video (google it!!).A couple of limitations with the camera:  There's a 4 gig file limit regardless of memory card size, which corresponds to about 11 minutes of 210fps high speed video in one take.  IIRC, that's = to 18 min of high def video.  If your intent is to set it and forget it while at the range, that won't work (beyond 11 minutes).  It's not a big deal, but something to consider.Secondly, the still camera is pretty poor.  I didn't buy it for that, so I really don't care.  There's a thread on [...] which discusses this more in detail and I had uploaded a picture of the same object with my canon vs casio, and you can clearly see the difference.This camera also features high def mode and standard video.  They seem to work pretty well, but I don't have any experience with any other high def cameras to give a valid review on the quality.Anyway, like I said, this is THE camera to get for sports analysis.

At $320, it's a screaming bargain.Here are some of the good points, for a \"normal\" camera:26mm-520mm lens.  Covers everything.AA batteries. Never have a dead camera.Easy-to-use menus and controls. Very intuitive and easy to learn.Feels good in the hands, and easy to carry.Easy to remove and replace SD card and/or batteries.Lens cap stays on with rough service.But that's not why I bought this thing...40 FPS stills!!! 5 FPS FLASH stills for TEN pictures!!! Do you have ANY idea what that means for CANDID photos, let alone action shots?1/40,000 sec. shutter in continuous mode, ISO 200 in bright sunlight.  This camera will stop action better than ones costing twenty times as much.In the three days I've owned it I've not even TRIED the video yet, I'm so taken with the high speed burst mode.Picture quality:I'm no camera junkie that nitpicks over every iota of corner distortion or what-have-you; if I take a picture of something interesting (race car sliding into a corner, snowboarder jumping a house, fireworks exploding, pretty girl flashing in public) and it makes the viewer go \"WOW!\" when printed at 13x19 or smaller, then I'm happy.This camera does THAT better than any I've ever used.Can't think of a time I've been more satisfied with a consumer product.1/25/2010 Update:Tinkering with the various settings has resulted in even more respect for this camera.  Night Mode Best Shot has given GREAT hand-held night pictures with no flash.Playing with different Manual settings have given great fireworks shots, better even than the FIREWORKS Best Shot mode.30-210 FPS Video mode is great outdoors.40 FPS Still shooting on a tripod gives great recoil studies in my gun classes.  When the skies clear I'm going to set the shutter at 1/40,000 of a second and try to catch a bullet coming from the barrel.  I think I'll be able to do it.I'm going to buy the FH25 when it comes out as it has better low-light capabilities as well as a 30-120 FPS setting that will be very useful including indoors.Way to go Casio!", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio Please get a clue!!", "Author": "N. Renaud", "ReviewID": "R7TFGHG1K34BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing. So is the EX-F1 and the EX-FH25 so why do I say Casio needs a clue? Because all three cameras have been discontinued with no replacements anounced. They do not appear to even have any replacement models in the works. This is a shame. It's a shame because Casio has completely failed to educate the public about these cameras and what they can do.Forget about side-by-side comparissons with quality and features of other cameras \"in their class\". These cameras shoot high speed video in a way that no other consumer camera on earth can do. You cannot shoot continuous high speed video at 1000-1200fps on any camera available for less than $15,000. Yet Casio has never marketed these cameras for this feature. that's in part because consumers don't know they want it until they see examples. Go to Youtube and search \"EX-F1\" and see what people have done with this camera, now 4 years old and discontinued last year. If Casio had a clue they would be blitzing the media with clips like this and people like me who have loved slow motion video since we were children would flock to buy the camera. The EX-FH20 was originally around $400 and now sells for over $500 even though it's old tech. The EX-FH25 is much improved and was available in December for about $350 but now you can't buy it at all in US and a Japan mold will cost you $800. What other electronic devices go UP in value like that?? The High Speed line of Exilims is a brilliant piece of tech that has been done a terrible disservice by poor marketing and poor development decisions.Oh, you don't care about video? Even if you are a pro with 5K worth of DSLR gear I challenge you to pick up one of these and use it to shoot stills of sports, dancing, fire, or any other hard-to-capture material and take some time to learn how to use pre-record continuous high speed stills.

At 720p HD with unlimited recording, everything looks crystal clear.

I have only used it a few times, but it appeared to work really well.  I have used it at 210 frames a second and at 480.  Both speeds appeared to work well.  I have not tried the 1000 setting, as it was not necessary for what I wanted to do.  My problem is that I have yet been able to view the video out side of the camera to see how it would look on a larger screen.  I am not sure if it is my mistake or a problem with the camera, but I cannot get any card reader to \"see\" the SDHC card.  They either will not read it at all or give me an error message telling me that the card is not properly formatted.  I am still working on that one.I have been unable to use the USB cable that comes with the camera to download to the computer either.  That appears to be a physical problem with the outlet on the camera.  I am sending it back to Casio to see if they can fix it.  Technical support did not help, but when they realized they could not the directed me to the repair website.  That was easy to navigate and like many other sites they provide the mailing label and material to be included.  We will see what happens.  Except for the inability to check the final step, the camera appears to work well on high-speed video outside with good lighting.  With any high-speed camera, the higher the speed the less resolution and the more light needed.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Slow Mo Res", "Author": "John Kay \"mercurial\"", "ReviewID": "RKIVX4ME3V8V9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well, I bought this for the high speed video, however, the image quality (resolution focus graininess etc) of slo-mo video is substandard.

The picture quality for stills is very nice, and it plays back really crisp on my 40\" LCD TV.  However, as far as digital cameras go, it's large and not easy to tuck away in a pocket or bookbag for travel.I bought this camera specifically for high-speed capture of fast moving objects.  And by fast, I'm talking 600 feet per second or more.  So I needed something that was at least 1,000 fps.  This camera advertised just that, 1,000.  What they DON'T tell you however, and I couldn't find in any ads or materials, even on Casio's web site, is that the picture quality is HORRIBLE!!!  Not only do you not get a full frame record (the actual recording is TINY, I'd guess 0.3mp), but the picture was completely unusable.  Out of the 10 times we attempted to capture the object at distances from 6 feet to 50 feet (and varying angles and backgrounds), I was only barely able to make out ONE frame out of about 2,400,000 (seriously) where we could see ANYTHING, and even then it was a matter of 4 people standing around the above mentioned 40\" LCD trying to spot the blurry spec as a difference from the horribly granular background.So...  High speed recording.... HECK NO!Which makes it nothing more than an average, if slightly overpriced, and fairly sizable 12mp digital camera.So...
