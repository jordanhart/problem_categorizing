It is extremely user friendly and it takes excellent pictures. The large LCD view finder makes it much easier to see what you are capturing and the built in zoom works great. One word of advice, when taking a picture at full zoom, keep the camera completely still or the images appear \"grainy\"", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "This camera takes the worst indoor pictures", "Author": "Picturetaker \"KRP\"", "ReviewID": "R3UK9C6SVOX4NK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera thinking: because its a Nikon it will take great pictures.  However, I soon discovered that any picture taken indoors with the flash resulted in round dust orbs or spots appearing in the picture.  I had no idea what was causing the problem then, after researching it on internet photogrphy sites, I realized it was a reflection from the flash off of microscopic particles in the air. This made the camera virtually useless indoors.  When I contacted Nikon's help number, they acted like they never heard of this problem.  Then, a look at their website reveled that they were, in fact, aware of the problem but chose to treat it as an acceptable design flaw - bottom line, the flash is located too close to the lens and results in reflective spots whenever the flash is used.  I would definitely not recommend this camera to anyone seeking quality indoor photographs.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Compact Digital Camera", "Author": "R.

It is ideal to put in a pocket or purse and carry when an SLR is too large.

The only thing good about it is durability; however, it still takes crappy photos.  I'm really disappointed and I'd like to stuff it down Ashton's throat.

It's nice if you take a lot of outdoors pics, like during rain or high humidity, I think.

McKenney", "ReviewID": "R1K0K9QECV8YJL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Up until yesterday this camera has been decent.  I found this on clearance on Aug 13 last year at a great price. Since the last Panasonic Lumix I had died just after the year warranty, i figured i didn't want to spend $400 for another digital camera since we still love our SLR film camera.  We opted for this one.  Maybe i am just cursed, but just after one year on this one and poof- no more pictures.  The LCD is black except for the on screen display, and I can view pictures in memory. It seems like everything still works, except there is no picture. I don't expect to keep spending decent money on digital camera only to have them break DAYS after the warranty expires. They should not be disposable!", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix is a cool deal", "Author": "Brian J.
