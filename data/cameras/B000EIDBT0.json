What really matters is the shutters, lens, and properties.  Here are some pros and cons of the camera:+ The screen is bright, large, and detailed+ The battery lasts quite a while+ The camera itself is smaller+ Transfers wirelessly to your computer+ Buttons are easy and well designed+ Picture quality is up to standard+ NEVER get red eye with this camera, no need to edit afterward+ Takes great pictures at night (lights, fireworks, ect)+ Takes fantastic portraits because the camera automatically focuses on the face of the subject- Sometimes the camera takes too long to take a picture, and if you have it on portrait mode it flashed 5-6 times before it snaps the photo- The wireless transfers seem to take forever, sometimes I think it may be better to upload directly to the computer- Every so often you will get a blurry picture (1 in 75 or so)", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "shutter and focus problems --", "Author": "M. Desai \"digital guy\"", "ReviewID": "RAY0147ST0OWL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After much research on the S6, I decided to give the S6 a shot.  The main features that attracted me were the large LCD screen, ease of use of the menu, and its light weight.  The wireless feature was really a ho-hum.After the purchase the LCD screen lived up to its billing, but without an additional glass eye-piece, the glare in bright daylight was quite concerning.  It was difficult to see the picture and determine if flash would be necessary.  You need flash in bright sunny conditions to get rid of the eye shadows.However my disappointment was that the shutter failed after about 80 pictures.  It kept giving me a \"Shutter Initialization Failure\".  I learnt that the shutter had failed and it was time to return the camera.  I have since exchanged the piece and highly recommend buying the extra warranty if you intend to buy this camera.I was quite pleased, while the camera worked, with the ease of use of the menu and selecting the settings.  The camera has about 6 canned settings for portrait, landscape etc., in addition there is red-eye elimination and flash that can be automatic or manual.The digital zoom is quite lousy though; as the light weight of the camera makes eliminating handshake very hard and the digital zoom ends up extremely blurred.The camera is made in Indonesia under NIKON design.cheers", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Bad focus problems, random flash, needs new firmware", "Author": "Shango Yenovich", "ReviewID": "R2N0ASZFETL1EW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an S6 just before my trip to Disneyworld.  Excited as anyone would be, I took a bunch of shots outside my house and then looked at them.  Not only were most of the pictures out of focus, but the flash would come on when in full zoom in broad daylight.  I chalked it up to a defective camera and exchanged it for another at Best Buy.  Now I had to leave for my vacation the next day and did not have any time to play with it other than charge the battery and take a couple indoor shots.  Just in case, I brought my Nikon 5600 also.Long story short, the focus problems still existed with the S6, the flash still came on for no reason, the camera would use a shutter speed more than 1/60 of a second in bright sunlight (some shots were 1/29th or something similar!).  Pretty much all the photos need one or two sharpening passes in Photoshop to make them look decent, and it basically took worse pictures than my 5600 and my 4300.  I would not recommend this camera until they work out the bugs in the firmware.  The LCD display is great (3\"), and the recycle time for the flash and saving pictures is great (<=1 second most of the time) but that is all I can say that is good.I am going to send a cd of pictures to Nikon and see what they say.  Maybe they just got a bad batch, but I got my camera from two different stores.  If you do buy this camera, I hope you don't have the same problems as I did.  I returned the S6 for a refund and am going to buy a D70s instead.  The S6 is nowhere in the same league as the D70s, but I expected the S6, being 2 or three generations later than my 4300, to take better pictures.", "Date": "May 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "H.

Our secret of photo shooting is to use the \"action\" setting. I've taken thousands of photographs of my wife running in marathons around the world. I just hold down the shutter button as she goes by, get a couple dozen photos and they all are crisp and clear.  We use that same function when lighting is good, rather than using a flash and having an artificial look.We have been able to take amazing night photos too by using either the night setting or landscape setting. The key is to use the self timer and have the camera sitting on a surface so that it does not move at all. The photo will be amazing.I also like the ISO function. I have mine set to 400 instead of AUTO. It ends up taking much better photos in low light settings!Would still recommend this camera. I hope it lasts for years to come :)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera.  My Minolta Dimage X (about 15% small in size than this camera) had reached the end of its useful life, having been around for about 5 years.  The Minolta had a 3/4\" screen on the back.  (this one has a 2.5\" screen- great colors)The best feature I liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens.  I don't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty.  Therefore, I was excited that this camera had an internal zoom.Tonight I was at a Bulls game, in the 300 section (nose bleed), and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of Kirk Hinrich.  The 3x optical zoom is incredible, but more so incredible is the digital zoom.  I was also able to zoom into the jumbotron, and it looked as crisp as if I was taking the photo directly.Action shots are GREAT. Low light shots are GREAT!It is exactly what I was looking for !", "Date": "December 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not the fanciest, but a great point and shoot", "Author": "L. Abair", "ReviewID": "R32IQ3UYGOBSG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after getting a junior mint stuck to the lense cover of my cannon.  The cannon was bigger and bulkier, but came with more bells and whistles (color select, super awesome macro, 6x optical zoom).  While this camera doesn't have all the fun extras the cannon did, it does have the small size, no extending lens to knock while shooting or get rained on (or junior mints stuck in) and the menu is easy enough to navigate that doing manual settings is almost do-able for a novice.  in other words, there aren't so many extras clogging up the menu choices that you give up on what you were trying to do.  While the macro on the cannon was better, the macro on the Nikon is good enough for the general point and shoot and the colors are FAR more saturated and in depth.  The screen on the Nikon is also a lot larger.  another cool feature is the battery.  The Nikon uses a li-ion batter which you never have to remove from the camera housing.  To charge the camera you simply plug it into the dock it comes w/, OR if traveling you can bring just the cable between the dock and the wall and use it to charge the camera.

This model's appeal in particular is that it can send your photos to your computer wirelessly, so let me get that right out of the way: you can eventually get it to work, but it saps the battery quickly (and I had two), and more importantly... I just could never get a good picture out of it, so the wi-fi wizardry is for naught.As a camera... What a disappointment; this applies to most point and shoots: they seem to get many eye catching parameters right, except the important ones. Large LCD screen? Check. Big brand name? Hey it's a Nikon so it must be good, right? Wi-fi wizardry or some such? Check. Results? Awful.Whenever you try to get a picture it tries to \"think\" for you, never relinquishes control... And eventually takes the shot... So the moment you were trying to capture is gone, unless you like having people grin artificially for ten minutes... It tries to flash at the slightest provocation, resulting in those garish \"tourist\" shots; you can disable the flash but then it's completely underexposed... Because I've always had somewhat shaky hands my shots always came out blurry. The only good point about this camera in particular is its macro mode - with the right lighting, loads of time and even more patience. But right after I lent this camera and one of the batteries was lost, it's just been gathering dust. What a waste!But even worse, honestly, is that the experience is bad enough to kill any photographic aspirations, and that's my biggest beef with this camera and its brethren. I ended up buying a Canon 30D DSLR and that's been great; while I remain brand agnostic what could I possibly believe from Nikon?So my advice is simple: If you're getting a camera for yourself, look at a cheap DSLR, and if you're worried about the size, look at the Olympus range of small DSLRs like the Olympus Evolt E520 10MP Digital SLR Camera with Image Stabilization w/ 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens or compacts but not point and shoots like the Canon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCD, the Panasonic DMC-LX3 10.1MP Digital Camera with 24mm Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)or their equivalent in other brands: You are buying this to unleash your creativity, for which you need to learn and eventually use manual control... No camera, even the ones that cost $8,000 can think better than you.
