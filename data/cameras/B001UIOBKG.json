Then as soon as i walked out of the store I started taking pictures, didn't even read the instructions,which are pretty plain foldout charts and a little booklet that i haven't even opened. I was using all the features just to see how they would come out.I'd take shots of my kids running around and I'd move the mode dial around from manual to image stabilization to auto to movie,then I asked them to stop for a minute to take a portrait. This camera has this face detection button that I didn't understand at first, maybe cause I didn't read the booklet yet,but it did the job itself! It actually recognized their smiles,no more frowns or faces looking the wrong direction. Then I used the panorama mode, this is the best feature cause it takes 3 shots in one wide photo, and it tells you transparently where the last shot left off so you could stitch your photo together. Now I got a picture of my house,the street and my neighbor's house across the street. The Sun starts going down and this is where the camera gets good, the scene mode has 12 different functions that take too long to write in this dialogue. so ill tell you that after i saw the pictures in my PC I was amazed that I took these pictures, very high quality. I did have one set back though, I put it in my back pocket and  sat on it, I cracked the lcd. This is not covered in my warranty but a company in L.A. repairs them exclusively for G.E. it cost me $40, well worth it. General Imaging company did a great job.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "very nice simple camera", "Author": "ForeverSPb \"ForeverSPb\"", "ReviewID": "R2MI3P5R1XSOQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter's 12th birthday.
