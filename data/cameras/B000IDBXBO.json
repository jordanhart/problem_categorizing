These are pretty solid and fit the bill perfectly. Having the ones that came with the cameras to compare with these really helped me determine how nice these were. The swivel that adjusts where the camera mounts is solid and thick. The guy who installed my cameras bent the crap out of the brand new Zmodo brackets during the install. That was just so they would stay steady. The next day I ordered these and replaced all 8 of the junk original ones. I'm not sure why a company like Zmodo won't included brackets like these? It would sure make you feel better about what you are buying. We all say the same thing don't we? Cheap Chinese Crap. Well these are cheap price wise but they are not crap. I'm not saying these are the best brackets money can buy but I am saying they ARE worth the money you spend to buy them. I rather pay an extra $25 to Zmodo and have them send these with the cameras they sell then the paper thin crap they include now.....Plus I would not have to follow the installer around replacing brand new junk brackets the next day. That's just my 2 cents. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.Robb", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "To fix the non-tightening ball head", "Author": "Dean Brown", "ReviewID": "R34CARUHA92XYK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought 4 of these. They are really nice quality, except for the ball head. In my case, ALL 4 of them did NOT lock when I tightened the thumb screw. But I fixed them all by grinding the thumb screw threaded bolts down into slightly pointed shapes. The bolt then does its thing pushing the side of the fixture up and towards the ball, locking it.The end of the bolt should be shaped a bit like a blunt pencil, rather than the flat end of the pencil as it comes.EDIT: I changed my mind - the ball heads are just plain junk. I stripped off the thread of the two that I actually tried to use, thus rendering them useless. Cheap enough to be used for extensions, but I would say these is a truly bad design, made in China trash.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good mounts", "Author": "Bill James \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R2LNRBQJRDU2QC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do like these mounts, I used them to replace the cheap ones that come with Foscam outdoor cameras and they work well for that application", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product for light weight cams", "Author": "gsquare", "ReviewID": "R2UC6O7XI7AWQ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used these in the past and they are sufficient for light weight cameras.
