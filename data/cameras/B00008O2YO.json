I bought it based on the positive reviews here, and I'm very glad I did!The Zoom (both in and out) feature is much better than I was expecting, because some reviews here led me to believe it wasn't that great. Well, mine does a terrific job! Of course, the extreme close up pictures are grainy, but you can get really close before this happens.It takes very vivid pictures that are easily transferred to your PC with the included USB cable. While it is true you must load the Kodak software to do this, the software is pretty powerful and has a very easy to learn (friendly) graphical user interface.It comes with an internal 16MB's of memory (18 Pictures at Best setting, 35 at the Better setting), but you probably would want to buy a 128MB SD Card like I did (which holds up to 149 Pictures at the Best setting, 298 at the Better setting) so you can really take pictures without having to worry about running out of space/memory before you do pictures. The Review and Delete features are first rate, as well as the LCD display. The Flash button is also great, since you don't have to search through the menus to cut the flash off or on (default is on).It has a movie mode that I don't really plan on using, but it's there if I want it. Of course, I doubt the quality of the video or sound would be that great, but again, the option is there. Same with the Share button, you press this button to 'bookmark' a given picture if you plan to send it to friends or family over the Internet in E-Mails, etc., or to print out on your printer. That way, you don't have to search through the many pictures to find the 2-3 you think are worth sharing or printing. But be prepared to either buy the Kodak 6000 Camera Dock or a Battery Charger that will charge Ni-MH batteries (most come with at least 2 Ni-MH batteries), because I've read on the Internet it uses batteries very rapidly, like every other digital camera out there. I would highly recommend this camera to family and friends and anyone else wanting an excellent bargain as well as an excellent camera!Bottom line-Pros:Price, features, LCD Display, 16MB's Internal memory, everything you need included in the box (except a charger or Kodak 6000 Camera Dock), first rate Zoom function, and no more film to take to the drug store!!Cons: No camera case and the batteries included are not rechargeable.", "Date": "December 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "does it worth?

It's my first digital cam, and here's my openion.you SHOULD get rechargable battries with this cam, I've got rechargable 2100 mAh and totally satisfied. It comes with normal battries, won't let you discover the camera features!If you plan to take video clips, you should get a memory card.I've got  Viking 128 MB Secure Digital Card and happy with it. The internal 16M will take only two video clips (with audio), each of 30 seconds and will get \"Memory Full\"The video quality is not so good, 320x240 and increasing the size will make it so bad.It's a chinese product, but it's reliable. I've seen alot of ppl complaining from the Canon A60.My friend has HP635, it's cool too. If you are a pro. then get the HP, you'll be more satisfied. If you need the simplicity get this one.Btw, the Burst option is not in the HP, and it's a nice feature, but I guess it's not a vital thing to chose a camera.The HP software is much better (cmon, it's HP).Those two cams are the best in this category ($100 to $200) after a long research. I was about to get the Canon A60, but it seems risky and stopped functioning with many ppl, then they suffered Canon customer support. One of them threw it away!The Nikon 2100 is also great, it captures video clips with 640x480 but with no audio!!!!! and that's why I didn't get it.Kodak can connect to your TV directly, it's a nice feature not included in HP, but frankly speaking I don't use it!

It is very intuitive, and I didn't even look at the book for the first few pictures;  it was point and shoot.  Downloading the pictures via the USB port was a snap (also very quick!) On the eMac, the pictures are automatically downloaded into a picture folder which works with iphoto.  The picture quality color is excellent when printed out.

This is my second digital camera and by far the best I have used.  I have read some reviews for this camera and I must say that most people complain about things that are easy to correct if you just read the instruction book.. The software that comes with it is great and easy to use. I don't see why some people have a problem with it. The battery life is actually really good with this camera. I use Sony rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries and get a lot of pictures out of them.  When taking pictures I love the 5 settings it has (4 are listed but the fifth is burst which you get going into the menu) plus the video. The burst setting allows you to take 3 pictures in quick succession. I think it's 3 frames per second. I agree that the video quality is not very good but this is a camera. I think common sense should tell you that if you want a digital video recorder go buy one. Overall this is a really great camera that I love to use. The only downside is that it did not come with a bag to carry it around. Obviously that is not a big deal but it would have been nice. So if you are considering buying this camera I would strongly suggest you do.

It's ideal for quick snapshots on a family vacation or the kids in the backyard.  It's also a perfect gift to give a kid who really wants a digital camera, but you don't want to spend $300.Other positives:  It's lightweight, doesn't require a lot of thought, and the small screen really guides you through what all the buttons are for.  Everything is well labeled, and sharing photos is simple.  Other people have said that they didn't like the software, but I didn't have a problem with it.Because it's designed to be simple, it has some flaws when it comes to more complicated operations.  It takes really crummy night shots.  Don't even bother trying to use the nightime setting unless you have a tripod.  Also, the screen on the back is deceptive, especially when it comes to nightshots.

This is a good basic camera. It has a lot of nice little options like zoom and a close-ups setting. A lot these days is made of the megapixels in a camera and although this one seems to be on the low side it takes great pictures.Some things to think about:This camera eats up batteries fast. you can't leave the batteries in overnight or they will die. If you do take the battteries out there is an internal memory that saves all your pictures so you don't lose anything. Nice feature.Also: USB connects right to any USB port on your computer which is nice. But you have to load the software to your pc and if you do this I recommend you go with the absolute minimum installation. There is way too much stuff on the disc and it will take over your computer as far as claiming itself to be your default program for all types of images and graphics.If you don't have any graphics/image software on your PC already then go ahead and load everything. But if you are like me and already manipulate images with other software go for the minimum installl.

It takes OK pictures and is easy to use, but the body is a thin plastic.  The battery hatch door on the bottom is very vulnerable to breakage.  Drop the camera once and you will easily crack the door.  You might think a big company like Kodak would make it easy to call in and get a new hatch door mailed to you.  The part is worth maybe 2 cents. I tried and was told no, you have to send it in for repair - for which there is a $50 flat fee!Also - don't bother installing the Easy Share software on your PC.

After using it for a year, I know the good and bad.The Good:-The price was the lowest for a good quality 2.0 MP-Good pictures-It records video (See bad)The Bad:-It does not come with rechargable batteries.  You either purchase their Kodak dock ($50-$70 more) or you buy a AA recharger kit ($30-$40 more). This is a hassle if you travel and just want to recharge your camera over night. The sony digital cameras come with a rechargable batteries and a simple cable to plug into the AC outlet.-The video recorded is limited to 30 seconds and the video only plays on Apple movie player. They give you Apple movie maker to view your video. I can't edit the videos unless I buy a Apple editing software.-It only records 30 second videos.Conclusion,This is an OK 2.0 MP starter camera.  Knowing what I know now, I would have spent the extra ($75 more) and bought the Sony digital Camera since it comes with a travel friendly rechargable battery and cable and allows you to record video to the extent of your memory card.

Well I guess I made a point that the construction is very durable.  The photos this camera takes are of excellent quality considering it is only a 2.0 mp I love all the modes it has and ease of use with the menus and the settings.  It has a date stamp that looks big and yellow when you print out the pictures but you can easily choose not to display the time/date stamp.

Couple this with the random shutter speed and flash control in \"auto\" mode and one may find themselves getting photos of things other than the intended subject matter (re: ground, sky or blurry/tilted images).CONCLUSION: Good for general still picture taking on bright sunny days. Easy to use and affordable. Because of the shutter/flash timing limitations in \"auto\" mode, those seeking to take quick pictures \"on the fly\" or a greater range of pictures in more challenging lighting/motion situations (re: nightime, action shots, sporting events, etc.), should really look elsewhere.", "Date": "May 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "\"ellj77\"", "ReviewID": "RW05KP8DW40FE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this camera, good quality pictures, great features and very easy to use!
