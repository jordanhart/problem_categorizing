I can take the best pictures I've ever been able to take! I can sit in an almost completely dark room and take a picture of something that I can barely see on the display screen, but when I look at the actual photo it took it looks as if I was in a well lit room! And I can take great close-ups I could never get with my old standard film camera. I LOVE this camera and I haven't even begun to play with all of its great features. I definitely recommend this camera to anyone, especially to novices like me! This camera works for great photographers or beginners.(Reviewed by wife, the recipient of the camera.)", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the size", "Author": "Desert Jackrabbit \"DJR\"", "ReviewID": "R2K2PEJZRH14QY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the Panasonic FX-33. To have a shirt-pocket-sized camera with a high quality Leica lens, optical image stabilization, wide-aspect ratio 8.1MP chip.  From reading on the Internet and comparing the Panasonic FX series to the Lica D-LUX 2 the Leica camera is programmed with Leica's prepriority software and Panasonic has their own software.  The main reason I bought the Panasonic FX-33 is that is has a Leica lense and is about half the cost of the equivalent Leica model and I can carry it in my pocket.  I'm tired of carrying around a big camera bag.The only thing I've noticed that I don't like is that skin tones seem to be light or have to be adjusted in Photoshop when the camera is set in the iA mode this is no problem for me.When shooting in the Normal Picture Mode there is an adjustment for Soft Skin Tones which I haven't tried yet.Otherwise, I really like the camera.  When ordering, remember the camera does not come with a Secure Data card so you might want to consider ordering one when purchasing the camera.  Also, my camera did not come with a case.DES-Arizona", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cool looks, poor image quality", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R3SM02YZDN9VXE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I picked up this camera to replace my wife's 3.1 MP Canon from 2003. As the camera will be strictly used as a point-and-shoot, I wanted to know how it performed straight out of the package. On an overcast day in summer with good and even light (2.00 p.m.) I took about 50 photos with it, first in full auto (auto fill-in flash, anti-shake and auto-ISO), later with ISO limited to 100 to reduce noise.My first impression: All images suffer from visible noise and lack of detail. Even shots of static, high-contrast objects (30 yards away) were sometimes simply out of focus: At ISO 100, zoom set to wideangle and at 1/320s shutter speed you can rule out camera shake as a reason for blurry images - especially with the image stabilizer on.As the camera appears to prefer high shutter speeds it will not stop down to give you better resolution of more depth-of-field. As a result, if it focuses on the wrong part of an image your main object might appear blurry. The Canon models I used recently (IXUS 850IS and A640) were much better at this.Adjusting the zoom lens from wide-angle to a more \"normal\" or light \"telephoto\" setting, things actually got even worse: In the \"long\" setting (100mm equivalent) I was simply not able to produce a single shot that I would call \"sharp\". In fact, some of the images from that old 3.2 MP Canon had better resolution and sharpness than what I got from the FX33.Even though I liked the natural skin tones, the good macro and the camera's ability to cope with high contrasts situations, I think I will return the camera tomorrow.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good for easy point-and-shoot", "Author": "tdwong", "ReviewID": "R3Q7P9XWM0EPGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took this camera to my 7-day Japan trip and here are myobservations.  In summary, this is a very good camera formost occasions.Pros:- The small & lightweight nature allows me to carry this camerain my pocket throughout the entire trip- The lag from switch-on to ready-to-use is short and enablesme to capture many scenes that could have been missed if I usethe older Optio 450- The image stabilization is very helpful, especially forthose moving targets.  There were cases it caught flyingeagles flawlessly.- The auto face-recognition feature is also a big plus.Through my trip I set the camera to IA mode most of the time,combined with abovementioned features, this camera is not onlyeasy to use and is also extremely handy to capture whateverscene comes to your eyes.Cons:  (Of course, being a sub-compact digital camera, it alsohas its deficits)- It has very limited manual control which makes it not so  good on special weather conditions.- 3x optical zoom is good but not sufficient for travellers  who want to zoom in to much farther objects (my older Optio  450 has 5x zoom)- The battery life is much shorter than my expectation.  I had  to recharge the battery twice during the trip which surprises  me very much and makes me feel that I may need to purchase and  carry a spare battery in my next trip2009-09-23I have now owned Lumix DMC FX33 for more than 15 months and havetaken it with me to two oversea trips.  Because my daughter alsoused this camera a lot, few more things were noticed in thisyear's trip and I would like to share them.Good,- the 16x9 scenic pictures taken are really beautiful- the 640x480 videos recorded are sharp and clear (they are also  suitable for YouTube/Facebook)- those preset scenic modes are really helpful for good pictures  under different circumstances (but you need to remeber to switch  to the correct scenic mode)- the compact battery charger is very convenient (even I have to  charge the battery every other day, I am still using the  original battery)- the camera body is sturdy.  In this year's trip, we accidentally  dropped the camera to the concrete ground (from about 5 ft. high)  and it came up with only minor dent on the body.  Everything  continues to work.  *** very amazing (& lucky) ***Not so good,- the video sound quality is not so good,- the zooming function doesn't work when recording.  you have to  move camera forward to get a closer view.Regardless, I have built up strong confidence on Panasonic, my nextdigital camera will definitely be Panasonic Lumix.", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good little camera, perfect for the novice photographer", "Author": "A. Carson", "ReviewID": "RPDSTEF6POP6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the silver model but received the blue one instead.  I didn't care, it's identical to the silver so it was just fine.  It was just kinda surprising to open the box and see a blue camera when you're expecting a silver.  That being said, it's a good camera.  I should mention that I must have left it on accidentally the other day and it was dead the next day.  The battery was totally charged before and I was surprised that the camera didn't shut itself off after 2 minutes or something.  I need to re-read the instructions about that part.  That just irked me because I was all ready for a day full of photo-taking and it was dead.I really like the intelligent auto feature.  And the image stabilization is great for walking & taking pictures.  It makes them come out really clear quite often.The screen is nice and big.  The buttons are easy to use.  I kinda wish the on/off switch was a button because if I put the camera in the wrong way in my camera bag, it accidentally turns on and that is none too good.  I am careful to put it in the way that keeps it off.The battery life is good and I love rechargeable lithium ion batteries instead of double A's.All in all, a nice upgrade for a compact camera for me.  I had a 3.2mp before and wanted a better camera for going to Europe for 3 months.  I'm here now and the pics have been awesome.  Very happy with it and the price was totally unbeatable.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great DEAL!!!", "Author": "Daniel Wells", "ReviewID": "R2PKYKCLY1XSJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Color accuracy, Amazing Intelligent Auto makes it almost impossible to get a shot out of focus (unlike my previous HP M417) and stabilization feature is unbeatable.

I typically use it for informal photos of friends and family, outdoor photos, and even took photos of food at a restaurant with surprisingly great results. No, it is not for school plays and sporting events. For that, buy yourself a Digital SLR (DSLR). The construction of the DMC-FX33 is reassuringly solid, unlike  some of the flimsy, plastic-y small digcams out there. I have found the color saturation to be quite good, as well as the sharpness of the images.

It has 27 MB Built-In Internal Memory. No biggie. Order an additional 4GB or 8GB SDHC which is more than enough.It is slightly larger than Canon SD1000. Its dimension is 93 x 51.1 x 22.25 mm as opposed to the Canon is 86 x 54 x 19.35mm.The manual is easy to read. However, it is thick and bored the hell out of me.The camera is lacking manual control, noise starts at ISO 200 or higher and protuding LCD screen. Make sure get an LCD screen protector to prevent it from scratches. However, the pictures overall look great. OIS works great because I tend to have shaky hands. In addition, the wide angle is superb for both indoor (family) and outdoor (scenery). In additon, make sure you get a case/bag for the camera.

I bought this camera as a gift for my daughter for the sake of getting her a camera and I'm ashamed to say, I chose poorly.  She hadn't the slightest idea about how to use it, after having cameras made by Canon and Nikon; the Lumix's greatest flaw is its many, many features.  Sometimes, people just want to simply turn on the camera and snap some shots... they shouldn't have to decide a bunch of features in order to do soemthing so simple.  Panasonic did a great job making their camera look sleek and put in good quality manufacturing.  But what the fine print doesn't tell you is, this is a camera you have to read the manual in order to use properly.  I won't go into details about this product because it's already listed, but I'll tell you that this camera is definitely not ideal for your kids or casual photo-takers in general.  My rating is based on the difficulty of use, rather than the quality of the product.
