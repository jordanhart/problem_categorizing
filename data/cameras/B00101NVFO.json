{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Reciever for Dakota Alert motion sensors", "Author": "Jay D. Anderson", "ReviewID": "R2Z7U528DL2QP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a well made compact little reciever that records up to 999 triggers with channle, date, and time for up to 4 Dakota Alert motion sensors.  You can configure the frequency and codes and the reciever can tell you exactly what channel has been triggered to tell you where the \"bag guy\" is.  I have one channel operating looking at the back door of my home.  The device has only one down side... it can \"choke\" now and then and this requires a \"reset\" (small hole-button in side you hit with a paperclip).  When you reset it you have to reconfigure date, time, etc. so the logs are correct.  But very useful product... you can set the chime to go and/or vibrate mode.  I clip on my pajama collar in bed on vibrate and it tells me when I have a \"fish on the end of my line\".

Chiles \"geezer game player\"", "ReviewID": "R2D3XEQ3UF04U2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already had the Dakota motion detector. The transmitter is mounted at the entrance to my driveway and the receiver blares away when any person or car passes in front of it. The beauty of the PR3000 is (1)you can carry it on your person and (2) it records the event as to time and date so you know what happened even if you didn't hear the alarm at the time.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Portable receiver", "Author": "Michael W.

My hope had been to be able to ascertain when someone came up our drive while I was on the far side of the house.  It has only provided that service about half the time.  I haven't been able to count on it and have stopped carrying it around.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "great idea", "Author": "cfeconline", "ReviewID": "R3K1FYF2899WTN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great idea but it has to be within veiwing distance or it won't go off.  If I can see the driveway, I don't need it!  It has a range of only around 150' at best.  I ended up putting it in the house on a windowsill so it would be useful at least in there.  I like that it will record the times that it is tripped so it is an excellent addition instead of a 2nd AC reciever if you need more than one alert.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Step Saver", "Author": "John H. Adams \"Jussi\"", "ReviewID": "R2YU3S488CWZUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our mail box is located about 300 feet from our rural home and trying to guess when the mail or paper was delivered and ready to be picked up was just that, a guess. Many wasted trips were made. The solution was to place a UT-3000 transmitter at the mailbox wired to a switch on the mail box door. A R-3000 receiver now announces and records when the mail is delivered. Our newspaper deliverer opens and shuts the mailbox door when he delivers the paper so that is announced also. This scheme has been in use for 2-1/2 years and has saved many steps. Lithium batteries in the transmitter last almost a year.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "good for the deer hunter", "Author": "JP Vic \"Bee Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3MXPOXLWC698G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had good luck with the receiver.  I had an extra sensor that I put on one of the deer trails, and linked it to this receiver.  Now whever a deer comes to the feeder - I get a signal in the house - ~100 yards away.Programing is not too difficult, but I need to reread the manual ever time I change somthing.

It numbers (1-4) which channel set alarm off. Does not have a automatic charging system so you have to remember to un-plug it in about 7 hrs if it is completely discharged. After a 7 hour charge I left it on 24/7 with both the audible alarm and vibrate on. It ran for 17 days and received over 1100 alarms. I have  transmitters on the driveway, front porch and back deck. My cats run in and out all day long and I always know when one wants in.
