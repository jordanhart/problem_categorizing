Instead of the usual plastic and white or brown packing, all is in a beautifully designed chic black, with every item showcased to perfection.Easy set up, right out of the box. I bought the Samsung Galaxy Camera with Android Jelly Bean v4.2 OS, 16.3MP CMOS with 21x Optical  Zoom and 4.8\" Touch Screen LCD (WiFi - White)a few months ago (also a great camera if you don't want to mess with a cell service for your camera) so it took no time at all, but even if you're an android newbie, it's still simple and straightforward. The Samsung website has some terrific videos showing various features. After an initial get-to-know-ya with this camera, check out more cool things you can do. Also, I myself find it helpful  in the beginning to download the PDF of the manual and print off parts I want. The whole manual is over 200 pages, so I just print off what I need.And even if you're relatively new to photography you'll feel like a pro with an easy to change lens. And about the lens, WOW! Looking at this camera? Get the model that includes the lens! More about the lens later...I could not be more excited!The Optical Image Stabilizer in the 18-55mm lens offers clear, sharp images. The NX System lens incorporates i-Function Technology which lets you control the camera from the lens itself. It provides one step control of the shutter speed.The AF (Auto Focus) is fast at 0.17 (!!!) seconds so it easily catches up to your next shot.Recently, I was photographing an awards ceremony. The 'money shot', of course, was the transfer of the award. My darn camera took so long to autofocus from the previous shot, I missed it. Got a second before, a second after. That will never happen again.And this is really cool...put the viewfinder up to your eye, and the touchscreen is disabled so your face isn't interfere with the screen icons.The GPS tracker enables photographers to capture their exact geographical location in real time.I'm already picking out the goodies to add to this camera. Samsung has a 10mm Fisheye lens, a 20mm pancake lens for taking great landscapes and an 18-200mm zoom...jeez, too many to mention that can be purchased separately. There are a lot of NX cases on eBay, if you want the 'real' one, when I looked, it was cheaper via Amazon versus the Samsung website.You can also get external flash, remote switch, microphone.This is THE camera, and the future of all cameras. It's easy enough for a budding photographer, slick enough for the pro.Any other questions or anything you WISH this review had, just click the 'comment' button below and I'll do whatever I can to help, be it a video, research, whatever. I love it and am happy to share whatever I can so that you can decide if it's right for you.UPDATE EDIT 3/4/14: The features and options never seem to end on this camera! It can get complicated, but thankfully Samsung has a dedicated support line for it. I've called twice with questions, never had to wait too long. Because this product is so new, if they don't know what youre talking about, ask to be switched to 'professional camera equipment' NOT 'digital camera'.I feel like there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers, so I admit I asked some stupid questions. They were explained with enough information that I could look up and research the rest.Since I am NOT a lifelong camera person, some features that would be 101 to others were new to me. And I'm so glad I had the Galaxy with Android Jelly Bean v4.2 OS, 16.3MP first.The more I peek into what it can do, the more excited I am. One thing I should clarify about my review...I say it is fine for a budding photographer, and it is, but if you just want something to take photos or movies that is point and shoot, you won't be taking advantage of it's full potential. This is a camera for geeks and tech junkies! If you are a newbie, but have the DESIRE, this can be a first pro camera.There is nothing else like this out there right now.Someone asked about a 'zoom button'. Like any professional camera, you zoom with the lens, you WANT to zoom with the lens. Part of what is cutting edge about this camera is the way the lens 'talks' to the camera. The information about the functionality of the lens is sent to the body of the camera, so that any options that you have to control the lens shows up on the screen. Each additional lens you may choose to add has different functionality...screen options CHANGE with each lens because the camera KNOWS which lens is on. This is HUGE!NEVER has this been done before, and I believe it will change the art of photography.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera with Android capabilities", "Author": "Gadgetman", "ReviewID": "R39ECPUC3PCKIV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I  have both the Samsung NX2000 and NX300 compact system cameras which are great products for photo shooting with wireless photos sharing capabilities. The Samsung Galaxy NX Smart 4G Camera is another great innovation which includes all the nice features of the NX2000 / NX300 cameras plus quite a bit more.  I would share the features I like about this Samsung Galaxy NX camera and include some comparison with the NX300 in this review.What I like about this product- the camera comes with the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean OS with full featured Android functionality. We can use the camera like an Android tablet for surfing the net / social media, sending / watching photo / videos, and checking emails. It has a large vivid 4.8\" 1280 x720 resolution display with touch screen controls for all the camera functions.  This is about 50% larger in size as compared to the 3.3\" display for the NX300 camera. It also comes with an electronic view finder with a SVGA (800 x 600) resolution. The Samsung Galaxy NX does not have a flip-out screen like the NX300 which I found quite convenient for viewing videos and taking pictures at lower levels.- The camera has a built in 16 GB memory (about 13 GB are usable). It has a Micro SD card slot which supports  SDHC (32GB) and SDXC (64GB) cards. It also comes with  a SIM card slot  for mobile phone providers.- The camera has nice picture quality with a 20.3 MP APS CMOS sensor. It supports upto 25600 ISO and a shutter speed of 1/6000 sec. These are the same as the NX300 camera. The camera comes with a built-in flash with a hot-shot for external flash.The 15 - 55 mm lens works well for many photo-shooting situations with a phase-detection focusing system which provides better and faster focusing. The lens also comes with the OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) function which is helpful for shooting fast moving objects. The lens's thread diameter is 58 mm in case if you want to purchase filters for it. This package also comes with a lens hood..- Very easy to navigate the camera modes and functions using the on-screen dial functions. There are also a variety of controls for the more advanced photographers. Some of the features I like included the focusing / exposure / metering modes, bracketing by exposure / white balance, and manual adjustment of the flash's power. The camera also comes with a neat feature called \"beauty face\" which automatically smoothen the skin tones either in real time or applied after the picture is taken. It also allow the taking of photos and video using voice commands- wireless Wi-Fi capability. This is a function which I like very much. The camera supports Wifi,  DLNA networking, bluetooth, and has a built in GPF.It works flawlessly for sharing the pictures with the various wireless options. The Samsung smart App also has a remote view-finder function which allows us to remotely control the camera using our smart phones.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera with its nice picture quality, compact design with interchangeable lens , and the wireless sharing capability. It also works like an Android tablet device with a nice screen size and display.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Disappointing Camera From Samsung {Edited}", "Author": "Keith Blodgett \"Hawk\"", "ReviewID": "R3O5QVQP1J7UEH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first impression upon unboxing this camera was \"Wow, that feels cheap.\" Everything's made from unattractive plastic. The single dial on the top rear of the camera (oddly blank) feels light, spins too easily and clicking it feels mushy. The other buttons on the camera, power, movie and flash all have the same, cheap, mushy feel. The shutter button has poor tactile feel.The camera is surprisingly heavy; for me uncomfortably, painfully, so.The back is so taken up by the huge 4.8\" LCD screen that the thumb rest is too short, more of an afterthought that cause me quite a bit of discomfort during extended use. The DSLR style handgrip is quite large (perhaps too large for small hands) to accommodate the massive 4360 mAh battery.On paper the idea of an Android OS with a 4.8\" LCD screen and a big APS-C sensor sounds great but I was sadly less than impressed.Because of the Android OS startup time from fully off to ready to shoot is a very long 23 seconds. In standby mode the camera was ready to shoot in approx. 4 seconds. The camera runs warm, very warm, even just sitting idle on a cool 50 degree day. I would worry about overheating in the summer months.Image quality was unimpressive especially in low light. Early morning, post sunrise, images with sky and clouds were extremely grainy and noisy. Performance in full light was better but not spectacular.  Auto focus was run of the mill, often seeking excessively in low light situations. High ISO performance was exceedingly poor. Past ISO 800 images were rather noisier and grainy. In auto mode the camera seemed to make poor choices for ISO and shutter speeds.Controls. Almost every setting is accessed via the large LCD screen.There are over twenty pre-configured shooting modes. I used several of them while checking out this camera. These selections are made from a top to bottom scrolling 'carousel' where you scroll through until you find the option you want. I found it annoying to find and stop on the mode I wanted. You're going to miss shots trying to find the mode you want.Continuous Shooting: burst mode. Surprisingly fast.Kids Shot: the camera plays one of three sounds to attract a child's attention and then bursts five photos.Macro: The Galaxy NX has a surprisingly short minimum focal distance with the kit lens and the macro photos I took were among the best results I was able to get from the camera.Rich Tone: Samsung's HDR mode. Processing time was excessive.Panorama: This is a sweep mode, smoothly move the camera (a tripod helps) to capture up to 180\u00b0's of view. Disappointingly the camera reduces the image size significantly in Panorama mode.Multi Exposure: combines two or more images into one.Drama: combines several images of a moving subject into a single image. The camera was very picky about detecting moving objects. I encountered at least a 50% fail rate trying this mode. Additionally, as with the Panorama mode the image size is greatly reduced.The camera can also be used in manual mode. Samsung calls it 'Expert Mode'. This gives you access to the standard PASM controls. The settings are controlled by three half-circle on screen dials that I found frustratingly hard to use. Try to change one and my thick fingers would spin the wrong dial. Using Shutter Priority mode I found the processing time of 30 second exposures was a disappointing additional 30 seconds.There are some things I did like about this camera. It's not all bad. It can produce decent images and I honestly think the majority of the limitations I experienced were due to the cheap kit lens. The 4.8\" LCD is gorgeous, in the right light, I recently went back to a camera with a beautiful 3\" screen and it felt small. Some of the included shooting modes are fun to play with. Connectivity via WiFi was rock solid (I wasn't able to test the 3G/4G connectivity) even in parking lots of places that offered free WiFi. There were eleven gigs of free space in internal memory. That was plenty of room for a day's shooting and testing. I never did get around to installing an SD card.In conclusion...I'm not really sure who this camera is aimed at. They seem to be trying to attract smart phone users with the ability to access the internet almost anywhere and instantly share you photos. But do you really need an expensive, heavy and complex large-sensor camera to post photos to Facebook and Twitter?On the flip side I just can't see this camera being attractive to professional photographers or high end photography enthusiasts. While the inclusion of the electronic viewfinder is nice I found the all on-screen controls to be distracting and bothersome and the image quality was for the most part lackluster.A note about durability. As I was finishing up the testing of this camera I bobbled the camera due to nerve damage and it took a spill. The height was not great, less than three feet, and the initial impact was on soil and grass. The lens came apart into numerous pieces. I was able to put the lens back together but it appears to have suffered internal damage and will not focus either automatically or manually. I accept that I caused this damage but I am very unimpressed with the durability of such an expensive camera.I really can't recommend this camera. Three stars but barely.A side note about Samsung's technical support that isn't reflected in my rating of this camera. Calling Samsung's support line was a complete nightmare. Audio quality was atrocious. At the end I was practically screaming to be heard. I spent close to an hour and a half on the phone speaking with seven different people. Each person I spoke to had to be told all my information, the camera's information and the reason for my call. Four times I was transferred to 'the proper department.' In the end I had a supervisor tell me, first that the camera did not exist and then, that it must be a UK version and I'd have to start all over and call their UK support line. I then contacted Samsung through their Facebook support page. It's been almost a week and they still haven't decided what to do about the camera/lens.{Edit}It took nearly a month of back and forth and arguing to get Samsung to agree my camera was a US version, it was under warranty and they would issue a repair ticket for it. It was shipped off at their expense, repaired surprisingly quickly and shipped back. The camera's now in working order. Only one thing marred the process. When they returned the camera and lens the put a cap on the rear of the lens (I'd shipped it with the lens attached) but only put a piece of what looked like a Post-It across the body opening. I found it odd they wouldn't properly cap the body to protect the sensor though on the whole the packing job, bubble wrapped and foam peanuts was well done. Kudos to their repair facility but I'm still very put off by the whole experience with their support people.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "This camera does have an LCD brightness control, but it remains highly over-priced!", "Author": "David Marks \"norcalidave\"", "ReviewID": "R3CHNTUGWUCTKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATED REVIEW, as of April 4, 2014:Keith Blodgett clued me in to the fact that this camera's unreadable screen issue might partially have to do with screen (LCD) brightness. Although no one else has as far as I know talked about this, it is important for anyone buying or using this camera, to understand how to increase the Galaxy NX's  screen brightness. On my camera the brightness was turned by default to a brightness setting below the half way point, and it was useless for outdoor photography!  Here's what you need to know to fix this problem:  Go to the camera's home screen, then choose the \"apps\" icon (a larger rectangular icon that is composed of 16 small squares) at the bottom right of your LCD screen. Then choose \"Settings\",  and then choose \"My Device\" at the top of that screen. Then choose \"Display\" and when you get to the display menu, choose \"Brightness\", which is at the very bottom of the display screen!  Finally, use your finger to move the \"brightness bar\" to the right, toward maximum brightness.  For outdoor shooting with any sun at all, you need to adjust this brightness setting close to or at the very maximum (all the way to the right).  WHEW!So now I can at least see the screen in bright sunlight, with that brightness setting moved all the way up, but there's still a fair amount of glare.  However, the LCD screen is then usable, although your battery life will probably be significantly reduced, using this setting.  As with the new Samsung Galaxy S5 smart phone, there should be a  sensor-brightness chip built into the camera, to automatically adjust screen brightness.The reason I am increasing my rating to three stars, is because the LCD readability is not as bad as I thought, as long as you remember to ramp the screen brightness bar up to a very high level when you're shooting out of doors.  Of course such an important control shouldn't be hidden 6 levels down in the menu structure of the camera...screen brightness on a camera like this, that depends so much on readability of the large LCD screen, should be either automatically controlled, or there should be a small knob or lever on the camera, for adjusting LCD brightness.But the Kies software that you need to use to upload photos (to a wireless/cellular network, or through the USB cable to your computer) still doesn't work consistently or smoothly, and the price of this camera is still way, way too high.  Furthermore, as I say below in my original review, using a digital camera like this to directly send photos to social sites, etc., just doesn't make much sense to me. Unless you're transmitting RAW files (which smart phones aren't capable of dealing with), it makes much more sense to send and receive photos using a good smartphone.  And the idea of sending huge RAW files over any cellular network makes no sense, either.In my original review, I stated that the Panasonic FZ-70 ($300 or less now, here on Amazon) has as good an IQ (image quality) as this Samsung Galaxy NX system, but I later edited out that comment. Yesterday I took both cameras to a beautiful ecological reserve here in northern California (Table Mountain), and took a couple of hundred photos, using both cameras. In looking at the results, I have to re-affirm that the Panasonic FZ-70's image quality is definitely as good as that of the Galaxy NX, plus the Panasonic software (PicBridge) easily loads and handles iPhoto files, directly and with no glitches. Addendum on April 13, 2014: I took more comparison photos of a very photogenic, wooded scene here in Paradise, CA, and I carefully compared the Panasonic FZ-70 photos to the Samsung Galaxy NX images, and AGAIN, the Samsung image quality was not only no better than that of the much cheaper Panasonic, it seems objectively to me that the Panasonic photos held the edge. What is going on here?There is no way that I can recommend this Galaxy NX camera, even over the $300 Panasonic FZ-70, in terms of photo quality, versatility, range, and ease of use!  When you realize the Galaxy camera is more than FOUR times as expensive as the Panasonic, you really are forced to gain a lot of perspective. How Panasonic puts so much photo quality/IQ into a camera with such a small sensor (compared to the huge sensor in the Galaxy NX), for $300, is a question I can't answer. However, I know digital camera value (I've owned close to ten different digital cameras over the years) when I see it, and the Panasonic FZ-70 shows tremendous value. Amazon has already dropped the price of this Galaxy NX system by $400, and they've got a long, long way to go before it's fairly priced!-------------------Original Review:This Galaxy NX Camera \"system\" supposedly provides \"sharp, clear images and 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi connectivity for simple, fast uploading and sharing\". Or at least that's what Samsung claims it does. Unfortunately, this product was not ready for actual production and in my opinion it is a failed prototype!The reasons for this product failure are multiple, and include a \"Windows 8\" concept, where theoretically a new operating system along with a touch screen should provide a better overall consumer device.  The 4.8 inch diagonal LCD main screen on this camera controls the vast majority of the camera's functions, but the Samsung engineers seem to have forgotten to design this LCD screen so that it actually can be seen in sunlight. At least Microsoft's Windows 8 OS, along with its touch screen emphasis, doesn't have to cope with outside sunlight glare.So the first and foremost failure of this Galaxy NX camera system is that you cannot see the screen details in either full  or partial sunlight (I found this to be an issue even on a cloudy day with only partial sun).  This failure to have designed into the camera a VIEWABLE screen, combined with the need to use this touch screen for almost all of the camera's important functions, renders this product virtually unusable for most outside photography (note that the new Samsung Galaxy S5 phone includes in its design a digital chip which automatically adjusts the screen light for various viewing situations).Another failure here involves the presumption by Samsung that consumers need a mirror-less \"almost DSLR\" camera in order to upload photos, etc., to the web. Of course this is a ridiculous assumption since any good smart phone, including the latest iPhones and the Galaxy S5, has high enough camera resolution (along with a seamless way to upload photos to social sites, etc.), so that incorporating such a wireless/cellular connectivity into a larger, mirrorless camera system is redundant and unnecessary for most consumers.So you are probably still wondering how I fared with this camera (I've had it approximately one month).  Well, since I shoot most of my photos outside, I was forced to use the \"Auto\" mode, since I could rarely see the LCD screen and so I couldn't use the manual functions. Unfortunately, in order to even use \"auto\" mode, because of sunlight glare rendering the large LCD screen useless, you have to use the small, lower-resolution viewfinder along with either manual or auto focus (you also need to be sure to first adjust the diopter control that's on the left of the flash unit).Interestingly, with the 18-55 mm OIS lens that comes with this camera, and even though the manual suggests there is an \"auto zoom\" button (there is no such button), both the camera zoom and manual focus are only accessible from the lens body (the focus ring is near the outside of the lens barrel, and the \"manual/auto\" focus switch is near the inside of the barrel).  By the way, I recommend that if you use the viewfinder, you switch the lens to manual focus, because that does result in sharper photos.I should point out that this camera DOES take good inside photos....the LCD screen works fine inside (without the sunlight problems that the camera has outside), and the color and white balance are very good...When I first received this Galaxy NX camera, I was hoping I could possibly find a way to justify the $1,400-$1,700 price, but now that I've had a chance to use it, I can't recommend it to anyone, at any price. Because of the failure of the LCD screen to function as a usable control center, this camera is almost totally crippled when it comes to taking outdoor photos, and that's the bottom line.In my opinion this product should have remained a prototype, because with the unviewable LCD screen, the bulk of this camera's systems and functions are unavailable for use, unless you plan to only take inside photos. Furthermore, the \"KIES\" software that comes with the camera is cumbersome, and erratic. Half the time it simply won't let me download photos from the camera to my iMac.  It's just another aspect of this camera system that's not ready for prime time!By the way, the manual for this product also says that you \"should not point the lens toward the sun\", because if you do, you may damage the sensor.  And just where should you point this camera when your subject is outdoors on a sunny day, and the sun is behind or near the subject?This Galaxy NX Camera \"system\" supposedly provides \"sharp, clear images and 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi connectivity for simple, fast uploading and sharing\".
