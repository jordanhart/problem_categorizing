It has a nice display screen  (which is important since the view finder is very small and hard to use) but the camera is designed nicely to be held in the palm using the display screen.  They supply a 32 meg smart media card and rechargable batteries/charger.  Which is needed because they run out fast using display window. (I bought an extra 4 to keep in the carrying case) The picture quality is excellent and the added 80 second movie is a neat option.  If you were considereing the Canon elph s100, take a second look at the Leica as it offers slightly larger size but double the picture quality for less than [price] and as always it has the phenomenal Leica lens.

It has 32 mb memory which helps in storing large quantitities of high resolution pictures!

The main reason was that I thought it had the highest resolution 4.3 megapix. In fact it does not and Fuji who made it have had to change their advertising which has been called misleading. It is like a 2.3 megapixal but used some funny formula to produce data files that have 4.3 megapizals, but the original picture does not. HOWEVER - it takes really great pictures and can do movies for up to 80 seconds (with included 32mb sancard) There are a wide range of settings - full automatic, manual, movie, night time, 'rapid fire' that takes 3 pictures one after another. The controls are easy to learn and can be manipulated with one hand. It is relatively small and fits in a pocket.  I was pleased to find a macro attatchment for it (you also have to by a small base stand to attatch this to the camera). this allows you to take extreme close ups mainly of skin which is good for me as a Dermatologist! Although it does have difficulty with colors at extreme close ups, it has no problem that I can see without the macro. The pictures is produces are really great. I also have an Epsonn 875 color printer, when combind with good photographic paper to print on they really do look like amazing pictures.  Now - I have not used digital cameras before so I can not really compare it, but I have seen other frineds camera and I really like my one. It is not as small as those Cannon Elfs.  It only uses rechargeable batteries. Make sure you buy it online - it is at least... more expensive in most stores. Enjoy.  Oh yea, it comes with easy to use software.", "Date": "January 16, 2001"}, {"Title": "A great camera under a different name", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RLFUGVZABMCAR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is indeed a great camera to use, full of features and provides high quality images.

While that is true, it also true that the pictures it takes are plenty sharp without \"doctoring\" and will easily enlarge to 5\" x 7\" without becoming grainy. This is in no small part a result of excellent optics. In addition, the true (optical) 3X zoom is excellent, and its ability to shoot rather long movies (80 secs with sound) is a nice plus. Having said all that in its favor, it is still (IMHO) *way* overpriced, mostly because it has the Leica name on it.

I've taken around 200 photos in the past two days, with impressive results. Its alright that its from 2000 (or is it 1999?), and only 2.4 MP, it still takes great photos.Solid construction, everything functioning great after 14 years. If there is a downside, its the memory and battery life. HOWEVER its not a deal breaker. I can't afford a Leica for $900 at the moment, so this is a fine choice for me. I will say about the memory: I have a 64mb card and I shoot all my pics in 2400x1800 and FINE quality, so I get 36 photos. Not a big deal. Go for a walk, take 36 photos, and import the files to computer. The battery: I use Apple NiMh rechargeable batteries, using the eye viewfinder and limit the lcd display use I got through two days use. Using the camera maybe for around 3 hours.They are cheaper on Ebay, just fyi. But I'm very happy to have this first Leica. Next I will save up to buy a Leica M8!", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Very Nice Little Camera", "Author": "Robert E.
