{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Check the internal memory.", "Author": "Darin Westley", "ReviewID": "RUKV21Q5MKISL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this as my first digital camera, and overall I think it is a good camera.  The controls are straight forward, and the images, when displayed on my computer monitor (Dell 15\" Flat Panel), reflect accurate color reproduction.  The problem I currently have is that when using the 8MB internal memory, if I attempt to take a picture when the LCD readout indicates six images remaining, the camera locks up.  The only way to get out of this mode is to open the battery bay door to power it down.  (The power switch will not do anything at this point.)  This problem does not occur when using a Compact Flash memory card.  I would consider trying another one of these if the store I bought it from had more in stock.", "Date": "July 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "I went through two of these...", "Author": "Ghost Writer", "ReviewID": "R2VFKGQNM8NH2P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I tried this out in the store and was impressed by how easy it was to figure out the basic operations without a manual.  It takes good pictures for general use, such as EBay or viewing on computer.  The price and styling are also attractive.There seem to be quality problems.  The first one I bought had problems with the macro lens setting.  It quit working!  The second one had a bad LCD right out of the box (illegible bands across the screen).  I noticed the demos in the stores had broken macro switches as well.  This model is made in China.  The 200, the next model up, is made in Taiwan.", "Date": "May 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "A decent entry level digital camera", "Author": "Bradley J. Lucas \"bjlucas2\"", "ReviewID": "R3U4TGL9BG9JSG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All I needed was a simple camera that could take resonable quality jpgs for newsletters and websites.  Outdoor pictures are fairly good and indoor (flash) pictures are quite acceptable.  The sensor is rated at ASA 200, so keep in mind that flash range is only about 12 feet.With a 32M flash card it holds 69 photos at high resolution.  Downloads are easy,the digimax viewer/browser is excellent and all the included software seems to run well enough in Windows 98.The only flaw is that it is too easy to leave the lens in macro position when taking normal range photos.  On the plus side, the macro pictures are excellent.  With Nickel-Metal rechargeables and conservative use of the LCD screen, battery life is \"not bad\" for a digital camera.  All things considered, a decent camera if your needs are modest.", "Date": "January 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Perfect Beginner's Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R57NLNL1J80HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's perfect for a first digital camera. It's very easy to use and the quality is very good for the web, email and for small 4x7 prints.I recommend getting rechargeable batteries, because the Alkaline won't last that long. Other than that, it's a very good camera.For the price of [$$$], you can't beat it.", "Date": "July 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "Abysmal picture quality at full resolution", "Author": "J. Stanley", "ReviewID": "R1MASJ3RHOZJLN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this looking for a cheap camera to put up pictures on the web.  1.3MP (1280x960) should be more than enough for that.  However, in 1.3MP mode, this camera takes awful blotchy photos.  I suspect this camera's CCD actually uses far less than 1.3MP and interpolates up to that resolution, since the photos this camera takes don't lose any apparent detail when downsampled to 640x480.  In fact, I keep mine set at 640x480 all the time, because that's the only way to get decent detail out of it.  Bottom line--this is a toy camera.", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Cool", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2UO415A19SLMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is wonderful for a beginner or intermediate photographer, though it only has 1.3 megapixels.", "Date": "January 1, 2003"}, {"Title": "A Great Beginner Camera", "Author": "Anne", "ReviewID": "R3MZAXWN7VRC5Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera. It is really easy to use, but there are two flaws I can think of. The batteries wear out pretty fast, so I am planning on getting rechargable ones soon. The other is that the pictures on your computer are very large. They take about 1 minute to transfer to another user on AIM, which is what I use mostly. I'd rather the pictures be half the size, because I have no use for large images.", "Date": "January 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Flash extremely bright", "Author": "L.

Now that I have an infant son I'm realizing.  Most of the pictures that I've taken of him with this camera his eyes are shut!  Everyone else seems to have normal flashes.The batteries do run down quickly, and the quality's not great which I don't mind too much.

It has NO optical zoom, only digital and the digital zoom is worthless. It has a really low picture quality, 1.3 MP. I bought this camera for $130 or so dollars a long time ago. It has done a good job for me for a long time but I just bought a new camera to replace it. I don't know about other camera's in this price range but this one is decent.
