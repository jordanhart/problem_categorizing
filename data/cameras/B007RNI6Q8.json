{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for the average camera user.", "Author": "MagnoliaSouth \"As soon go kindle fire with sn...", "ReviewID": "R1DVBDIPMRIFNU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this at Woot because it was cheaper there, at the time, than it was here.I took over 8GB of photos (yep, I really did) with it when I went on vacation for two weeks. Just got back in fact too. I flew from Mobile to LA and then we drove from LA to London Bridge (in Arizona), to Las Vegas, to Reno, to Lake Tahoe, to Yosemite, to San Francisco, to San Jose, down the PCH back to LA then sadly went home to Mobile. Suffice it to say that were a variety of things to photograph.Here is what I found:* If you're looking for a quick photo, the recovery time between photos varies greatly. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes slow. Fresh batteries does not seem to make a difference either. The point is, don't depend on it.* The focus is also very slow as well and sometimes has trouble focusing at all, if it's in heavy shade. Can still be a little slow in bright light, but it always focuses well, again in bright light.* As with most digital point and shoots, the clarity doesn't do well on dark days or heavy shade. This one definitely falls into that category.* Works excellent on bright sunny days. I will say that on the bright days, I got pictures that look very professional, except for the brighter color thing... more on that in a moment.* The sport setting works amazingly well. As we zoomed by interesting things, I would roll down the window and snap, at 70 MPH. Many times it looks like I planned it and they were lovely, of course there are a lot of trees-that-got-in-the-way photos, but most are amazing in clarity and pretty good with color.... so long as it was sunny.* Color is good in sun, but it's still a bit on the cool side. Warm colors are not as bright as one would expect, which is odd. That said, it takes only a second to fix with your photo software (even it's just Picasa).* I was pleased (and surprised) to find that the zoom really does work rather well. Most point and shoots (or the ones I've used) are a fail on that point. This one is pretty darn good!* The video is a hit and miss at the same time. It is very susceptible to camera shake. Also, the focus does not work all that great when zooming in. If I had to complain about any feature, it would be this one. I was trying to video record a hummingbird that we saw by the Golden Gate bridge. It never could focus at all on her. I was definitely annoyed.* The panoramic feature is somewhat decent. The problem I had with it is the same problem I find with other LCD point and shoot screens. Sometimes you cannot see it well so lining it up is a total fail. However, when you can see it, and you can get near the lining up spot, it does a great seamless job.As for other pre-set settings, I found that all work fairly good, but I personally really did like Sport best. I'm not as steady as I used to be, and I saw that sport fixed that.All in all, this is a really good camera for non-professionals and your average camera user. I give it four stars because of its lagging recovery. That was a definite annoyance.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible camera for anybody.", "Author": "Hinano", "ReviewID": "R2MO6JAUP6YE1G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm by no means a camera pro but I can  say thanks to this camera I learned how to use manual mode because all the preset modes on this camera are ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.The camera is also extremely slow. Between shots it would take like 10-15 seconds and the models would get annoyed and tired waiting for me to change the ISO or shutter speed because it was too dark for this thing. Even my old Canon SX200 was faster even though both cameras use CCD. The only plus side of this camera is the zoom. 26x zoom is great if you need to take photos from far away but when you want to take a photo of something immediately in front of you, the manual mode takes forever to process and all the auto-modes fail miserably.A lot of my photos turned out dark or had poor details and the camera on my Samsung Galaxy S3 even took better pictures. I regret wasting my strength holding this paperweight when I could have taken better photos with my phone. In an aquarium my GS3 was able to capture a swimming fish but on this camera it just came out as a huge blur in both auto and manual modes. Anyway unless you are some kind of creeper or astronomist who needs to zoom in real far to take photos, do not buy this camera. If you want decent quality pictures up close, there are plenty of more compact cameras that are much much faster and take probably equal if not better quality pics.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kodak Z5120", "Author": "Marilyn Fellows", "ReviewID": "RY5OH7CF0J2OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!
