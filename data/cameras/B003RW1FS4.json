Being very unfamiliar with the newest in digital cameras, the only thing I knew was that I wanted another HP.  After a bit of browsing on Amazon, I chose this one.  I absolutely love it!  It's VERY compact (way more than I expected), it takes great quality pictures and videos, and it's super easy to use.  The one thing I would mention, when unwrapping the product, is to tear apart ALL the plastic.  I almost threw away the instructions and CD that came with it, they were well hidden inside the hard plastic wrapping.  I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!", "Author": "Diekastro", "ReviewID": "R2RDRH8T1D1O03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great, is lightweight, rechargeable battery is used, you smile and face detection, and resolution is very good ...

The touchscreen menu is sooo much better than figuringout which button to push for menu options.  The pictures were clear and crisp. Not sure about how long the li-ion rechargablebattery last for picture taking so I just purchased a backup from amazon. The battery takes only 2 hours to recharge.

I needed a camera to replace one to use for going out with friends and this camera is perfect. It has many different settings that are great.

I was expecting a good camera but, this is better than expected. I brought a touchscreen from Walmart for more money and it was crap. It arrived sooner that expected which was great hard to open from the plastic and when I took my 1st picture it was wonderful, nice and clear the vie do was nice and sharp and I did all of this without reading the instructions. It's very to use which is a plus. I have been taken pictures every day since I got this camera. And the camera I got from Walmart was returned the next day.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP PW460T 12MP Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom", "Author": "Gerald Williams \"booklistener\"", "ReviewID": "R1OJA13RI9AT9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is solid, metal frame, more features than I will ever use.  You have to understand I am a point and shoot kind of guy.  I still make my subjects squint into the sun. I do use the zoom and flash but that is about it.  I shot my grand children all day today at the park, at Mc Donalds in the play area and at home both indoors and out; about 240 pictures worth.  Not a bad shot in the bunch, clear, beautiful color, and all well lighted.  I had to read the manual to figure out the touch screen but I already have down those features I will use.  I don't connect the camera to the computer to download pictures; I take the card out of the camera, plug it into the computer and use drag and drop to organize.  The battery still shows full but I did order two extra so I will have them if I need them.  You do have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it; that is not an issue with me as I bought extra battries but may be for some.  This is my third digital camera; my first was an old Kodak 5000, big, clunky but weather proof.  I still keep it in my boat in the summer for fish pictures; it was a great camera in its day.  My second is an HP R707, about five years old and also a very good sturdy camera.  It too took very good pictures but a lot of blurry ones, not the cameras fault but mine, I am not steady. This new PW460T didn't have a blurry one in the bunch.I do take good care of my cameras, the Kodak has to be close to ten years old and still works fine and is still used.  I will keep the HP R707 as a back up but after using the much smaller and more featured PW460T wouldn't want to have to go back to it.If I encounter problems I will update this review; for now five stars all the way.*********IMPORTANT UPDATE*********Since I installed Media Impression, I have had my computer lock up when useing several programs and had others crash citing a \"Missing MagCore.dll\"  This is an ArcSoft file and the only ArcSoft software I installed was Media Impression.  I have not changed my review of the camera but the free virsion of Media Impression isn't as good as Windows Media Player.  Unless you plan to buy the full virsion don't load it and save yourself a lot of potential problems.  I run Windows 7; several Knowledge forums discuss this problem.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP PW 460T digital camera", "Author": "R.
