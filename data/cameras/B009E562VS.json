{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Leica Side Great, Panasonic Side Just So So", "Author": "M42 \"Section 2:  Operations And Intelligence\"", "ReviewID": "R1QDMTIC15Z7MD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of the hybrids Leica sells under its own brand.  They let Panasonic manufacture the lens under a license and the camera hardware.  There are some small differences between the V-Lux 4 and its Panasonic sibling, the FZ200.  The zoom rocker is different, the rim around the flash sensor is gone and the flash pop up dome has been flattened.  All cosmetic changes.  There is a raging debate as to whether the Leica version is just the FZ rebranded with the red dot logo ala the old Mercuries, which were rebranded Fords with slightly different grills.  No, the Leica is more like the Toyota Camry and Lexus 300, the same car, but with noticeable upgrades.There used to be more differences between the Leica and Panasonic cameras.  At one time Leica used different coatings to add a more contrasty look.  From what I've been able to tell the coatings on the two cameras are identical now.  Where the differences come in are with how the two cameras process images and quality control.  Leica has its own processing software, even though the processing engine is the same.  The differences are subtle, but noticeable.  Leica's processing affects color balance, tone and white balance.  I found in my tests the Leica's were fairly consistent out of the box and produced standard looking photos whereas the Panasonics were the luck of the draw.  Some of the Panny's were over saturated or had a color cast to them or the white balance or exposure was off.  Not so with the Leicas.  I'm told that Leica has representatives in the factory in Japan who test a high percentage of cameras that come off the assembly line.  Panasonic grabs a representative model to test for every 100 K cameras produced by comparison.  The differences in the tolerances between these two cameras is very apparent.What about the camera itself?  To me the Leica part of the partnership did well.  The lens is sharp and fast remaining at 2.8 aperture all the way to 600mm.  The images produced by Leica's software are very impressive, especially for a small sensor camera.  What is not impressive is the Panasonic side or the camera itself.  It doesn't feel very durable in your hands.  The door that opens for the USB port is flimsy and feels like it will break off after about a dozen uses.  Likewise the rear LCD doesn't feel like it's connected to the camera very well and could break.  The screen is sharp and rotates, which is a nice feature.  The EVF likewise is surprisingly sharp and clear giving close to 100% view of the scene.  Autofocus is slow and iffy.  Even with autofocus tracking turned on if there is any movement in the subject the camera focuses out and then in and then finally in focus again.  This can be very frustrating if you are shooting people or wildlife.  With stills I haven't noticed any problems with the focus, other than the fact that it is slow.  Manual focus is a pain to use and not practical so it is not any help in these situations.I found the exposure meter to be accurate and you have multi meter, center weighted and spot to choose from.Image quality is good up to around 800 ISO where noise becomes a real problem.  The small sensor is sensitive to noise and noise is apparent even at 100 ISO under magnification.  However, I've found it is easily removed by running Neat Image and without any damage to details.  Speaking of details, the default setting for noise in the camera is rather aggressive and causes loss of small, fine detail.  But setting NR to -2 helps recover that detail.One thing you should know is that with small sensor cameras depth of field is different than with large sensor cameras (DLSRs).  What this means is that shooting at an aperture of 2.8 will be totally different.  With a small sensor camera, like this one, if you were to shoot a bouquet of flowers at f2.8 the entire bouquet of petals would be sharp.  But shooting that same bouquet with a DLSR at f2.8 will result in the flower or petal you focused on being sharp and the rest of the bouquet being thrown out of focus.  This is known as bokeh.  Because you will have a larger zone of sharpness (depth of field) at f2.8 with this camera you can keep it set to f2.8 when in low light, thereby enabling you to use a lower ISO which will help with the noise issue.  This is where having a constant 2.8 aperture pays off.Is the V-Lux 4 worth the extra money over the FZ200?  That's a harder one to answer.  If you get a good FZ200 that's within tolerances then it becomes even harder to answer.  But keep in mind that Leica comes with a two year warranty versus the FZ200's one year.  And the Leica comes with Lightroom 4.3.  The extra warranty and Lightroom likely offset the price difference, unless you already own Lightroom or Aperture.All in all this is a camera that has a lot to offer.  When you compare it to its competitors you'll find they all have glaring deficiencies.  I gave this camera four stars because it represented the best balance in the bridge camera line up irrespective of its flaws and shortcomings.  I shoot with a !d series Canon professional camera with L lenses.  That adds up to a lot of weight to carry around.  The V-Lux 4 gives me a long reach high quality lens on a camera that produces very good quality photos all in a lightweight package that's easy to carry around.4.5 Stars", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Leica VLUX 4 Camera Review", "Author": "Fred Sgrosso", "ReviewID": "R2AJ25J8VN78UF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leica V-Lux 4 ReviewI love the camera! I have been a loyal Canon customer and love their cameras. However, I am getting older and do not relish carrying my heavy telephoto lens with my heavy Canon 60D camera.This little, light beauty takes wonderfully sharp images and is nimble and quick (starts in less than 1 second). I love taking nature photos as my primary interest in photography. With the 24x zoom, I can go from a wide-angle (25mm) to an effective 600mm telephoto. The camera has a 4x digital zoom which I have not even turned on. With my fixed focal length, heavy, Canon 300mm f4 \u201cL\u201d lens, I reach slightly more max. telephoto focal length when coupled with my 1.4x extender, and the1.6x factor for the \u201cC\u201d size sensor, making it an 672 mm f 5.6 system weighing 4.8 lb. The Leica lens is f.2.8 from wide-angle to tele! That makes for much more interesting photo possibilities and this camera with lens weighs 1.3 lbs.I have learned to use a different technique when using the Leica for my nature shots. The little control (Settings) to change the shutter speed is too fussy for me and I waste valuable time trying to turn it. I use the Shutter Preferred mode and shoot my optically stabilized shots at 1/2000 sec. It is very fast and I am able to reach the high speed I need to use with a hand held 600mm shot. The Auto ISO feature works very well and in the Florida sun most of my exposures are at ISO 100 and around f3.5. I use the Vivid exposure mode and I am very happy with the results. With my Canons, the Aperture Preferred method was my favorite mode. The plethora of many large controls on the Canon 60D makes it easy to use any exposure mode. The controls of the Leica are very well situated and it fits my hand beautifully.The Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) takes a bit of getting used to. There is nothing like an optical view finder for moving targets such as a flying bird. I find, I can, with practice, acquire, follow my targets, and shoot my images  quite well. The camera can shoot 12 frames/second (fps) at full resolution and up to 60 fps at lower resolution. The quality of the images is fantastic. For some reason, I feel the whites are more pure and very white. Using the spot meter mode, and a bit of underexposure, I find the exposures for my many white birds are excellent.Shooting close ups is also handled well. Battery life is exceptional, especially if you view the images with EVF instead of the LCD screen. The included Adobe Lightroom 4 software helps make the superb images. I shoot in the Raw/jpg mode. Final processing, rarely needed, is done in Photoshop.The camera also takes great videos too. The built in flash is OK. No small flash can compare with a large external flash or flashes.What is missing? WIFI capability.I think it is astounding to be able to buy a Leica camera for a hair under $800.00. I feel it will be my only camera soon. I am able to shoot quality images with much less weight. It is almost too good to be true. The camera is well worth the money!

Richardson \"animal lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3KIKC7EZIVV1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to use SLR cameras back in the day of film . Then came the point and shoot cameras.  Seemed they were taking just as good photos as my SLR.  And that is when I made the switch.  I've been using Olympic for decades.  My last one was really getting slow on the shutter speed and I wanted a new camera for a trip I was taking to Africa this November.  I had noticed the Lecia 18191 V-Lux in a catalog I received over the holidays.  The price seemed great for the type of camera it was, but as an amateur photographer, I had never heard of the brand before.  I did some extensive research online and read reviews.  It seemed like the perfect choice for my needs. A few months passed and we booked a trip to the Sea of Cortez along the Baja Peninsula to view whales, dolphins, sea lions, sea birds and a mirage of marine animals. The adventure cruise line informed us that a professional photographer would be a special guest on board to give us guidance on photography.  I knew this was the camera I wanted and what a fabulous opportunity to have a professional show me how to use the camera before our big safari in the autumn.  But how do you purchase a $900 camera sight unseen?  I thought I would go into the various camera shops in Chicago to \"test drive\" different cameras and see which one worked best for me.  The cruise was leaving in two weeks and I didn't have time to camera shop.  I bit the bullet and purchased this Leica.I ordered the camera from Amazon one week before departure.  Freaking out that it wouldn't arrive in time, Amazon came through like champions and it was delivered in 3 days.  I cannot begin to tell you the fabulous pictures I began to take in just auto mode. Magazine quality.  I love every single thing about this camera.  I have played around with the shutter speed, apertures, light meters, ASA, etc.  But why bother?  This camera in auto mode  takes the most amazing photography.  The professional photographer on board the cruise told me that this is the Ferrari of cameras.  All passengers carrying their big, expensive equipment and I was the envy of the trip.  Yes, buy this camera.  You will be so happy!", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "Thornwood Mom", "ReviewID": "R2EU74H1YAKTN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Planned trip to Africa, Serengeti safari.  the old camera was not going to cut it so we bought this one, primarily because of the zoom.  Well this was a GREAT choice.  Im no pro or even good amateur photog, Im usually a photo journalist at best, it aint pretty just proves I was there LOL.  BUT I have gotten so many compliments on what a great photographer I am from my shots. First the zoom is magnificent and I got some really amazing pictures thanks to this camera.  A leopard in a tree eating its prey, a vulture nest with babies, just so so many things that you would not beleive. Even our guide could not beleive the shots we were getting.  The other feature I ended up using a LOT was the shutter burst, where you click and it just keeps taking shots.  So yes I ended up with a gazillion shots of everything but then that let me capture some great moments like a hippo yawning wide, the water running out of his mouth, a lion opening wide, two giraffe's playing, etc shots that you cant time to capture.  We had the good fortune to see the great migration and I snapped so many pictures of the wildebeest crossing the masa river, these look almost professional, they capture some animals leaping mid air, etc.  birds, in flight, etc.  These two features and the great quality of the shots made this the perfect camera.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Ignacio", "ReviewID": "R1XEZP2KLRL41C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect for travellers who don`t want to carry heavy equipment.Takes stunning pictures even with very low light.Highly reccommended.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use and easy to create good photographs", "Author": "Tom J.

I don't work for National Geographic or Newsweek. Rather, I take photos of what I see around me (which, in New Mexico, is abundant, given our diverse selection of wildlife, plants/flowers, sunsets, views, balloons---no aliens, yet). These are photos I share with friends or post to Facebook. So why not do that with a $100 digital camera from Walgreens?I've gone through several digital cameras these past few years, most of which I end up re-selling on Amazon, as I don't like the picture quality. Granted, some (much?) of that is photographer error, but it really does seem that the quality of the picture also depends on the quality of the camera.In anticipation of an upcoming trip to Spain, I took the plunge and bought this one. On our first trip overseas, most of my pictures were washed out. On the last trip, there was a long delay between 'click' and 'picture' on the camera I was using. As such, I liked that people said this camera is faster.I've played with the camera for a few weeks, shooting pictures of hot air balloons this morning. The shutter is fast! I can only imagine how the camera operates in multi-shoot mode. It takes very little pressure on the button to take the picture, which eliminates shake/blur. The photos are crisp and clear.Like a lot of digital cameras, this one does a whole bunch of things; many of which I will never dabble into. You can take 'still' photos or videos. If you do a video, you can identify a spot on the frame and turn that into a photo. There are 'auto shoot' modes, as well as specialized selections.The camera comes with a basic manual, but a more detailed version is available on-line. This was helpful, as a quick scan let me know what the camera can do. Of course, I didn't read it thoroughly, but it at least gave me a good overview of the camera's potential.So, I'm happy with the purchase. Spain, here I come.Update (11/18/2013). Ok, so I took the camera to Spain. As I hoped, the pictures turned out really good. The camera was easy to use and it held up well during the travels.

However , when I checked out sample pics of the two cameras online I felt that Leica's pictures where just better. I am amateur photographer but love photos and been taking pictures a long time.  There is lot of debate about these two cameras and the so called Leica or red dot effect. In the end I didn't find that the Lumix images, while absolutely excellent, created that same emotion response in me that the Leia pics did. It could be all in my head. I've never used a Lumix so its not fair to compare. For me, Leica images affect my heart while the Lumix affect my head (thoughts). I prefer a picture that affects me emotionally, so I guess that's why I ended up choosing the Leica over the Lumix.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Thom H", "ReviewID": "RKZS1ZW6V6XUG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has tons of options and of course it has a leica lens, Im a beginner but wanted to invest in something I can grow with.
