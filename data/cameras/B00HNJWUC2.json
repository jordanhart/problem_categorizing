{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not as great as I hoped", "Author": "teamnasty", "ReviewID": "R2RI819QQBTSSS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently bought the Sony DSCW830 as an upgrade from my Sony DSCWX9. My former camera seemed to be having trouble focusing, a lot of pictures were turning out blurry no matter what I did, but it had been a really great camera with lots of cool and helpful features, the panorama feature (about 180 degrees) was awesome, and at 16.2 megapixels the resolution had been top of the line when I bought it.This one, the DSCW830, I thought would be even better. From the summary it seemed to have the same special features, an 8x zoom instead of \"just\" 5x zoom, and it had better resolution at 20.1 megapixels. Also, the panorama was described as 360 degrees, which I took to mean literally 360 degrees all in one shot.Sadly, even though it's only been a few days since it arrived, I don't like it nearly as much as the first one I had. You have to hold the camera perfectly still or the shot will be blurry. The only way I've been able to get it to take a clear picture is if I set it on a hard surface and push the button, not holding it at all. The panorama feature is not 360 degrees all in one shot - it's 180, like my old one. The menu has fewer features and effects (soft skin, soft background, landscape, night portrait, night scene, low light, gourmet, pets, waterside, snow scene, and fireworks, while my previous camera also had backlight correction, anti-blur, twilight, white balance, metering mode, and face detection). The new DSCW830 is also smaller overall, and even with my small hands I find it harder to handle with the difference in size.If you've never had a really nice camera before, this would probably seem like awesome camera to have, and the simple menu features and ease of use probably makes it a good one to start with. However, I'm going to give the new DSCW830 to my kids to use, and continue using my old DSCWX9 instead. In my case, the DSCW830 just isn't an improvement in any way except more megapixels.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "grhphotos Lov's this camera,", "Author": "Gary Hudson", "ReviewID": "R3H16W7C2BTLOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a professional photographer an I owned two additional Sony cameras (DSLR-350 & 100) and my DSC830 performs as well or sometimes better than my larger cameras.

Lots of tech features for various shooting modes but within rather limited shooting options and I think this is what the majority of buyers for this type of camera want, also I think the compact size is a strong selling point.Outside on a bright sunny day it works perfectly and the zoom delivers good results.  Movies and sound, for very basic shooting, are reasonable.  The panorama option I thought was really rather superficial, far too short at a few seconds to do anything creative though maybe useful if you wanted to shoot a room interior or line of people.  Nice of Sony to replace the rather ungainly zoom lever on the WX80 with a much more easy to use toggle swwitch on this camera.The downside for me with the W-830 are not the images but a couple of other areas to do with the camera and Sony.  The battery/card cover is rather flimsy and could easily be broken accidentally and it takes longer than I would have expected for the camera to get ready for the next shot, no doubt to do with the 20.1 mega pixels.  Sony persist in producing dedicated accessories for their products.  Here you get a USB cable to connect the camera to a pc for charging or downloading images, this looks like a unique Sony connector cable (it will not even fit the slightly older WX80 camera) so make sure you don't lose it.  Of course you can take the card out and download images with a reader but you can't recharge the battery without the Sony cable, even using the mains charger that comes with the camera you still have to use this cable from the charger to the camera.The Instruction Manual is just a concertina sheet of one-side printed paper and only covers the very basics.  Fortunately Sony provide a downloadable PDF Manual on their US website.If you want to take straightforward record-of-the-moment shots the W830 is as good as any other compact camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Average \"budget\" camera", "Author": "MyKeyReviews", "ReviewID": "ROIRZHOVT4UKR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\u2666 Brief \u2666The W830 is within Sony's \"budget\" range of compact cameras and is available for a fairly low price, but sacrifices a lot of extra features the more \"premium\" cameras have, such as WiFi, NFC, extra zoom and better components etc...This camera comes in our different colours (black, silver, purple or pink) and is so compact, it can fit into the palm of my hand. It's also very comfortable camera to hold and is very light in weight.Photo quality is okay, it can take some pretty decent photos but due to its small sensor, quality is going to be limited.\u2666 Box Contents & Recommended Extras \u2666- Box Contents: W830 Digital Camera | Battery | USB Cable | AC Adaptor | Power Cable | Wrist Strap | Instruction Manual.- Recommended Extras: SDHC Memory Card* | Spare Battery.* There's no flash memory(well, enough to take 4 photos), so getting one of these are a must! (You can go for any brand you want, however I would recommend a memory card with no less than 8GB memory capacity & of class 10).\u2666 Ease of Use & Navigation \u2666Personally, I found the camera really easy to navigate around, both externally and internally.There aren't too many buttons located around the camera like you would find on the more advanced cameras.To select which shooting mode you want (photo, panoramic or filming), there is a little slider on the back that allows you to switch between each one.When it comes to different modes within the cameras software, just click the menu button and scroll through. You have four different modes to choose from:Intelligent Auto: \"Exposure adjustment with automatic settings\".Program Auto: \"Auto exposure with adjustable settings\".Picture Effect: Choose between the \"Toy Camera\", \"Pop Colour\", \"Partial Colour\" or \"Soft High-Key\" effects.Scene Selection: 11 different pre-set modes to choose from that will adjust the settings for different scenes, such as \"Portrait\", \"Landscape\", \"Night Scene\", \"Beach\" & \"Snow\".Compared to how other cameras handle taking panoramic photos, Sony's cameras makes it really easy to take such photos, you literally press the shutter button and sweep the camera from left to right, which it then stitches them all together for you.Movie mode there are only two settings to select from; \"Auto\" & \"Picture Effect\".\u2666 Photo & Video Quality \u2666A higher mega-pixel count in a camera does not mean it's going to have better photo quality compare to a camera that has less mega-pixels, there's more to it; sensor size, lens quality & the imaging processor etc... The more mega-pixels there are, means the larger prints you can get without the loss of image quality, but if you don't have a decent photo then you're just left with having an oversized photo that takes up more space on your memory card (Roughly 7.5MB per photo!).Baring in mind this camera is more towards the budget range, the quality isn't going to be crisp, and unfortunately after dealing with some higher-end cameras, it's made me notice the poorer quality much more than what I would have done so beforehand.So photo quality results I've had whilst using this camera have been a mixed bag, many shots taken have looked pretty sharp, clear and genuinely really good, whereas other times not so much with photos looking blurred and a bit grainy.This camera performs well outdoors in decent lighting; landscapes, portrait or taking photos of flowers came out really well in my opinion, only rarely would I have a random problem with exposure.With the zoom, I had a lot of issues regarding to the focus, on the camera screen I wouldn't think twice, but it's when I have the images on my computer, I notice the images are actually blurred... Ooops, too late for retakes!Low-lighting conditions are a hit or miss with this camera, most photos come out okay, it's only when you start zooming into the photos you'll notice the slight noise that comes with the photo, other times the noise can be apparent straight away, along with the photo not being as sharp as it could.Panoramic images looked great with the image zoomed out to fill the screen on my laptop, but when you zoom in you can tell the quality isn't quite there.Using the 720p setting when filming videos were okay, nothing special but is at a level where it's good for home videos etc... That's about it.If there is one thing I could say that really bothered me, it would be the screen. In-low lighting conditions, the screen can seem fuzzy and there is some very noticeable lag when moving the camera around.\u2666 Final Opinion \u2666The W830 is an okay camera, not the best but certainly not the worst. Its size will be very convenient for people who want a camera that can simply slip into ones pocket, and most of the time can deliver decent snapshots, with the ability to zoom in 8x to get those out of reach subjects.This camera definitely has its ups and downs so I've listed the ones that have stood out to me during my use.\u2714 Pros:\u2713 Very compact.\u2713 Comfortable to hold.\u2713 Easy to navigate & use.\u2713 Has the ability to take some decent photos.\u2713 Partial colour is a really cool mode that singles out a single colour in a photo (blue, green, red or yellow).\u2713 Sweep panorama mode makes it simple to take such photos, all in one sweeping motion.\u2716 Cons:\u2718 Poor in low-lighting conditions.\u2718 Sometimes struggles focusing when using zoom.\u2718 Video quality not the best.\u2718 Screen looks fuzzy when in low-lighting conditions.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly as advertised", "Author": "Carl W.
