{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great point and shoot camera", "Author": "Jason Barton", "ReviewID": "RIJ76CPN6TKTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I got this Camera before the official lunch date of March 22nd. So I had about a month to play with this. This is a point and shoot camera, not a really fancy camera.  Here is a break down of my pros.#1 The clarity of the pictures are very good. It captures more detail in each picture.#2 The filter choices. My favorite by far is all of the advanced filter settings. There is fish eye which I find to be a funny feature. There is a feature where you can turn all your pictures into Black and white except one certain color. For example green. So it will take a picture black and white except for anything that has green in it. If anyone watched the movie Sin City you know what I am talking about. This feature is great so your pictures can really stand out. I took mine to the Rose garden and photographed the roses. The color filters are red, blue, green, purple, orange and yellow. So basically your rainbow colors. It also has a toy camera feature which is great for some of the silly pictures.#3  It is waterproof. Although I have not tried this feature. I had a friend who did. According to him, it works great. It also has a filter that is waterproof up close filter for those underwater shots.#4 Shockproof up to a certain  point. I am an avid hiker and treat my camera and my phone very rough. I have dropped this camera several times. It still worked to perfection. I wouldn't recommend dropping it to much. But if your kid gets a hold of the camera drops it and throws it. It should still work. so no big deal there.#5 Video quality- This is a awesome feature. I took this camera to a private Paula Cole concert and taped some of the songs. The quality of the video was sharp and very clear. It looked like I was right on stage with her.  So you can take this to concerts, sport events, or just people watching.#6 Great shutter speed- there was a time I needed to get several shots very quickly. The delay time was less than 1/2 second. I got off several shots very quickly. Wound up with some amazing once in a lifetime pictures.Cons:#1 Lack of color choices for the camera- I would love to see more color choices for the camera. Right now all you get is yellow, orange and Blue. Since i am writing a review for the blue one, you know what color I got.#2 If you don't take the time to go over the features it can be very confusing.  I am still learning what some of the features and filters do. To me some filters don't really do anything.#3 The charging station. In order for you to charge the battery, you have to charge the whole camera instead of taking the battery out of the camera. I am sure there is a separate accessory for this but for know you need to plug in the whole camera.  So if you don't have an extra battery, you will have to wait 3 hours for your camera to be done.Well there you have it. I will update this review when I explore the camera even more. I would recommend this camera to a friend and family. It may seem expensive at first with the $229 dollar price tag but its worth the price. For all the features and clarity you get its worth it,. Once you own this camera it will create great once in a lifetime memories.  If you have any questions feel free to ask, I will answer questions the best and honest way I can.  Thanks for reading.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent features in a small pocketable camera and rugged.", "Author": "AstroBob \"AstroBob\"", "ReviewID": "R32ZVMM9QA4O0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My family has several small pocket type cameras in addition to regular high end DSLRs (I am a professional photographer). One of my Nikon pocket cameras had the battery door fail. The cost to fix it on basically a disposable camera means it gets junked and get a new one. This one cost more than the average similar camera but you pay for the water proof, drop proof and general features so worth it for the abuse these cameras can get. this one works very well and gives great photos and videos are top notch.  Low light ability is pretty decent with high ISO user selectable speeds (something many other similar cameras don't have...only auto select.All of the cameras we have had before of this type were Nikon except for one Fuji. That Fuji has been trouble free (battery door hasn't failed ;-) either). The deciding factor is its higher durability construction and dust/waterproof feature. We are all kayakers so less worry about a dunk than my others.Only negative is you plug the camera in to charge it and the battery stays in the camera. I am getting an aftermarket external charger so I can have one charging while the other is in use.  My old cameras used 2-AA battery whereas this one uses a dedicated battery. Normally these are expensive but there are many cheap sources through Amazon comparable to buying a couple of rechargeable AA batteries so not an issue.The battery recharges quickly....about 2 hours which is a big plus. It also appears to be able to charge from a laptop via the USB cable although haven't timed it to see how long it takes.The wireless connection to my Android Tablet is a very nice feature although it may be more useful for other people than me as my tablet takes SD expansion cards so can just do it direct....but there are many tablets and phones that don't have card ports for additional memory. The wireless transfer is fast though and certainly a good way to do it.Mine is yellow...I wanted that for kayaking if it should go in the drink but there are other colors available if you don't want such a bright one.The operating system is easy to use and has a ton of neat features and filters to keep you entertained. You can also turn off or adjust various audial signals which is great for times when you don't want to interrupt an event.I didn't give the last star only because of the external battery issue...but overall it is definitely a keeper. I suspect it will be a lot more durable than many other camera I have owned over the years. I don't abuse them but they do get frequent hard use.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "rugged point and shoot with some nice extras", "Author": "Ocean State Prime", "ReviewID": "R37S9NIVF5AG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no photography expert, so this won't be an in-depth technical review like the many helpful ones I've read here on Amazon. Instead, I'll just mention the things I like and some things that can be improved about this camera.I bought the camera mainly for the water-resistance and shock-resistance features. I want it for biking and other outdoor activities. That's why I bought the yellow one, so I'd be able to find it if I drop it. I haven't tested the ruggedness (I hope not to).You may be wondering about the geotagging feature of this camera. The camera does not have built-in GPS. What it does have is the ability to talk WiFi to your smart phone, which does have GPS. You must install the FujiFilm camera app on your phone (or tablet), fire it up and put it into the mode that serves up GPS info to the camera. You also have to turn on the geotagging feature on the camera. Klunky, but it works.The app also allows you to upload photos to your phone or tablet. It's not automatic; you have to select what you want to copy. I'd rather just automatic sync, but I suppose that would use up too much battery.The way this WiFi stuff works is a bit odd (to my mind). The app basically commandeers your phone's (tablet's) WiFi, disassociating it from whatever WiFi network to which you were connected while it's connected to the camera.It also has the ability to wirelessly connect to a computer for the purpose of uploading. To use this, you fiddle with the camera to connect it to the wireless network your computer is connecting to. I have been able to get the camera to connect to my home WiFi, but I have been unable to get it to connect to the PC running Windows 8.1. Really, there's so much fiddling to make this work, it's probably just easier to use an old-fashioned USB cable.The camera has an abundance of shooting modes, including the Scene Recognition mode, which essentially picks automatically from some of the other shooting modes. It has a bunch of fun modes, such as pop color, low key and partial color. These are especially good if you routinely share your photos without using a photo editor on them first.I've played with the video a bit. I'm not much of a videographer, so I can't say much about it. It does have the ability to shoot stills while making a video, which seems like a nice feature.I love how fast the camera is. When you hold the shutter button down, the camera will take multiple shots. You can choose between three repeat rates and the fastest is really fast (sorry I'm too lazy to check the specs). You can set the camera to save all such shots or only the last.All in all, I'm happy with this camera. Certainly it is the most functional point-and-shoot camera I've ever owned.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Work as advertise", "Author": "John Marcheschi", "ReviewID": "R116N38QADY3UX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at a lot of cameras for a trip to Belize and was worried because everything I looked at had mixed review and multiple failures.

I took it with me on a 50 foot sailboat during a sunset cruise.  The camera did not get wet or dropped.  Three times in one hour the camera would just freeze up while I was trying to frame a shot.  The boat was moving on 3 to 4 foot waves, not gentle, but no wild movements.  After the camera would freeze (ie. I couldn't turn it off or use any functions) I had to pop the battery in and out so that the camera would work again.  This would never work if I went underwater so I returned it to the store.  They told me that 21 other people had returned the same camera in one week because it had so many problems.  The store's camera guy said that it probably only needed a firmware upgrade but he didn't know for sure and many people don't have a way to get firmware upgrades while on vacation in Hawaii.  To be fair, the photos I was able to take were okay as long as they weren't zoomed in.  The zoom action shots were awful.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Swimming in Puerto Rico", "Author": "Suzanne \"physician\"", "ReviewID": "R11WSVE8UJU404", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worked great even underwater and around reefs and in the pool.

Luevano", "ReviewID": "R1QMVFGR38S980", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first off lets get some things clear first. this is a value digital water camera. so my review is based off water use.the only negative i had with this is when taking from out of water to take say top of water pics, drops, streaks would appear on lens which would blur/blemish above water pics. i had this issue a lot while @ the lake and pool last couple of days. granted non issue if you able to wipe with towel etc in between underwater and above water photography. panorama in full sun seemed to leave pics darker than i would've preferred (trying to get a pic of the lake from my kayak) but nothing a simple software fix on your pc can't fix with one click.other than that the filters are pretty cool, dynamic tone is my favorite and just like other reviews can be a pain to have to navigate folders on folders to get too and then change back for regular shots.the camera reminds you every single time to check door before snapping pics. at first thought was rather annoying but sorta welcome after taking a lot of memorable water pics the last few days.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot", "Author": "Juan Carlos Zequeira", "ReviewID": "R3QH3HZPHVY6BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really easy to transfer the pics to my smartphone via the free app. Lots of great filters and modes.

I have had this camera for about a month now, and it is good for the price.  The pictures aren't the best, and if you leave it on auto they come out blurry most of the time, but if you use the right setting for what you are taking pictures of, it usually comes out pretty good.The reason that I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the wireless transfer is a little difficult and confusing to get setup.  Once you have it set up and get used to how you have to transfer the pictures, it works pretty well.I love that it's rugged and waterproof, but I haven't gotten it wet yet, so we'll see how that works one of these hot summer days.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lens fogged on second day of use", "Author": "Emily Nedell", "ReviewID": "R1L6SR801NHYEU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (from Best Buy) for my son for a family vacation to go tubing in New Braunfels and then to Guadalupe River State Park. By the second day of the trip, all of the photos were fogged. Also, many pictures in dimmer light appeared pixilated. The colors are good. . . It's OK for making keepsakes but if you like to make enlargements or \"arty\" photos this is not the camera for you. I also have a Canon PowerShot and Nikon. If I were able to take the camera back I would spend a more and go with a Nikon waterproof. By the way, I've since learned that \"waterproof\" does not mean \"fog proof.\" Best Buy told me that all waterproof cameras fog up--which makes no sense because isn't the foggy lens due to water getting into the camera?", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Underwater Pictures", "Author": "Jamie A", "ReviewID": "R3B0X6WU99WLR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We decided to purchase this camera after the success my Dad had with an older model.  We took several pictures during our annual trip to Mexico!  Kids had a great time taking pictures underwater.  After the first day, we tried to view them on the camera, and were only able to view about half of them.  Once we got back to our room, we input the card in our computer and they were ALL there!  After that, we were always able to view the pictures, but decided it was best to download the pictures every night in case something like that happened again.  Not sure what the issue was, but it only happened the first day.

The wifi transfer is smooth, I even use my hot-spot as the medium when I'm out on the road, works great. As my mentioned on my subject line, wish it floated, almost lost it when I tossed it to my wife at the beach and she missed it, it was only 8 inches of water but the strong undertow and waves dragged it out, almost a complete loss. If it floated it would have popped up and no concern. I'll be adding a float to the hand cord just in case.

In a effort of pure over-engineering instead of doing something simple like letting the camera join a network, and I can just use the file explorer to go the node and download the pictures, they make you load some \"autosave\" POS program to do it all for you.  Its awful, its impossible to set up, and as I was hoping to use this camera at parties at friends houses and be able to put the pictures up quickly on the PC, now not usable.why they couldn't just let the camera be a plain old simple node on a network is beyond my comprehension.
