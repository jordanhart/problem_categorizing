Afterall, the Canon T-50 is tough, accurate, exceptionally well made, and will mount almost all of the non-autofocus lenses (i.e. FD mount) made by Canon.  I mean, really!  I bought one because I'm in love with high quality cameras, especially Canon.  I have dozens of Canon cameras and lenses.  But here is the irony:  This instrument is for amateurs who have a set of the exquisite, EXPENSIVE Canon FD lenses!  It's like getting a Volkswagon bug for your collection of Porsche racing engines.  Sure, it's well made and made by Canon.  But you can't adjust this camera.  It's has one mode: automatic.  Now, it's a great deal if you have an old Canon FD lens and just want to take snap shots.  But you don't have control of aperture, shutter speed, exposure compensation, or anything else.  Allow me to reiterate: This is an automatic camera and you must accept what it decides.  Its computer replaces your brain.  Sure, it's beautifully made and rugged. It'll impress your mama and your BFF. If you have an old Canon FD lens lying around and you just want to make snapshots of your friends -- sure, buy a used T-50.But -- if you want to have control of the image making process -- if you believe photography is truly a blend of art and science -- then save up and get a T-70, T-60 or best yet an awesome T-90.  The T-50 is a fine camera, but it thinks it is smarter than you are.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome", "Author": "Kenneth Combs", "ReviewID": "R1ERLPSNDCK7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "awesome works great fast shipping just as it was describe will recommend to friends and family great value for the money a great find", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better then expected!", "Author": "Shawn Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R2MV05QO9A33LW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this because my grand-pappy had one when I was little. I wanted to see what it was like. I did some research on the camera. found it to be OK-good. So I bought it. Package was delivered on time with no fuss, packaged well and safe. Seller was cool.This is a \"beginners camera\" for its age. don't get me wrong, Canon makes great cameras and this one is a tank. But this is an automatic camera. Kinda like a big-boy point- and-shoot. It's a computer that does the work for you. All you have to do is focus. If you want a camera that requires more thinking get a Pentax K-1000 or a Canon T90 or a Nikon F100.Camera worked perfectly. No battery acid. Shutter fired, Film winder worked. Auto advance worked. Computer worked. Small amounts of wear and dust probably from age and usage.Like I said, its a good camera. All you have to do is focus.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002KJCUPM"}}
