After 3 weeks of summer 90-degree heat, high humidity and torrential thunder storms in Georgia, I'm happy to report this camera continues to hum along just great.  I have not had to reset it once, and have monitored it remotely via my Moto Droid almost daily (using the free IP Cam Lite viewer, which delivers the full 640x480 live feed).  I use this camera to monitor my driveway and it serves its purpose with beautiful daytime color, excellent night vision, and better-than-expected low-light performance.  I have it set to record video upon motion detection and FTP it to my ReadyNAS server, and it has worked flawlessly.  Of course, the nighttime insects of the Southeast trip it almost constantly at night, but you can fully adjust the motion zones and sensitivity to minimize on false tripping.  I have not seen a better camera with the feature set of this camera at this price point, and if it holds out in the coming months I will definitely be purchasing more to cover other zones around the house.  My father has been running one in Texas for a little longer than I have and he's thoroughly pleased with it as well.  I'll provide an update a few months from now.Update [February 5, 2011] - Just a quick note to say that the camera has still been working flawlessly, 24/7, for 6 months now.  Outside operating temperatures have ranged from the 100 degrees to 13 degrees and it just keeps on working.  I don't know why it has on again/off again availability on Amazon, as this is clearly the best outdoor wireless IP camera that they sell.  However, apparently you can still order it directly from Sharx.Update [August 16, 2011] - Camera has been installed for over a year now and continues to work without a single issue.  Has never had to be rebooted even once, recovers immediately from power failures, and continues to record directly to my ReadyNAS.  I wish I could afford a half dozen of these!  If there were any enhancement to made to them, pan & tilt would be awesome.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Peace of Mind", "Author": "S. Faulk", "ReviewID": "R19L4CI7RC20AR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few months ago our house was broken into from a very brazen group of three robbers (punks) that backed their car into our driveway, jumped over the fence and smashed the back sliding door in order to gain entry. Luckily our home has an alarm so they quickly made their way through the house and out the front door without taking much.  Our neighbor did witness the event but sadly only got to a brief description of the car and suspects. I decided it was time to take home security up a level and cover some key areas of the house with security cameras. After a lot of reading and studying, the Sharx line seemed to be a great way to start a system so I ordered one to try.When the camera arrived I followed the instructions for set up and everything went smoothly. As mentioned in other reviews the manual is very easy to follow and written in clear English.  I had the camera configured and running on my wireless LAN system in about 20 minutes. With the picture quality and basic configuration all set up, the next step was being able to see the camera when I am away from home. I have AT&T; Uverse for Internet service and the Sharx manual includes absolutely perfect instructions to configure the 2wire router so you can view the camera remotely via the Internet. Without the manual I probably would have been lost on this step but the manual made the process so simple! After this step my next test was viewing the camera on my iPhone Safari browser using the 3G network to confirm I had a WAN connection, and yes it worked perfectly. After the test I installed an app that a friend who has a handful of Axis cameras recommended called Live Cams and again everything worked perfectly.  This is a great app for viewing IP cameras and worth the money ($1.99) if you have an iPhone or iPad.It was time to have my camera record events (alarms as they are called). Setting your camera to record when there is motion is again very easy and the settings can be adjusted for more or less sensitive motion activation.  Make sure on this step you expand your open browser window to see the settings. The default window size will not show the settings options unless you do this. Windows IE has a more graphical window to adjust these but it can still be done in any browser by typing numbers.  Just remember that the lower the \"Threshold\" numbers the more sensitive and the higher the \"Sensitivity\" numbers the more sensitive. You can also block off areas that you do not want to cause the alarm to start recording in this same settings window. For example if you have a busy street in front of your house you can configure the camera to ignore motion in that section of the overall picture.Another great option is email. I set the camera to send me an email if it detects motion and that works as expected, sending an email with a photo anytime it detects movement. Note that you can configure the settings to limit how often it sends an email so you don't fill your inbox when some bird, bug or dog for example is creating motion alarms on the camera. I have mine set to send an email no more then every 5 minutes.After running the 3605 for almost two months without any issue I have now added a 3606 and a 2607 (for the interior). I plan to add two more 3606 cameras so I will have almost the entire exterior in view at anytime. I would really like to see Sharx come out with a Megapixel camera in the future but this current line up still has good quality. My wife also has an iPhone and loves the fact she can check on the house and the dog from her phone at any time. She tells me she keeps an eye on the driveway from her work computer all the time and it makes her feel safer knowing what is going on at our house. The break-in really shook her up for a while, so her peace of mind is worth the cost alone.Some of the key benefits of the Sharx camera for me:-Because each camera can record to a MicroSD card built into the camera, it acts like its own DVR.  Even if your home is broken into and everything taken, as long as they don't remove the cameras you will still have a record of the dirtbags.-The camera uses very little wattage so it is easy on your electric bill.-The picture is clear and sharp both day and night.-The camera will work with a variety of browsers for configuring, monitoring and playing back recordings. I have tested it with Safari, IE and Firefox. Firefox with the Quicktime plug-in is my favorite and if you watch with the primary stream option you also can monitor live sound (creepy but good for eavesdropping).-The camera works with both my Mac and Windows computers.-The build quality seems decent and should last for many years.-I have been in contact via email with customer support and there was a response within 4 hours.I will be happy to respond if anyone has questions or comments.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sharx wireless rocks", "Author": "Max Oelschlaeger", "ReviewID": "R2ILQ9JICNI7V9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the previous \"five star\" review. Let me add a few additional points.1. The manual is excellent, and totally sufficient for installation, assuming a reasonable degree of computer and internet saavy. No doubt the manual was written by a native speaker of the English language. <g> An index and table of contents would be useful additions.2. Although I did not need Sharx tech support, other reviews elsewhere note that tech support is excellent. If you can set up a state of the art HD TV with surround sound and all the bells and whistles you'll likely have no problem setting up this unit.3. The image quality (IQ) is outstanding, as well as the Depth of Field (sharp from front to back). I've set my unit to \"record on alarm\" (i.e., motion in the field of view) for a single still frame and a one minute video. Simply superb.4. Upgrading to a 16 gig card is definitely worth the candle, as the DVR capacity is increased by a factor of four. New files automatically overwrite the old files once the card is full.5. Obviously, my Sharx is setup in an outside location. The power-supply must be plugged into a weatherproof 115 VAC outlet within two or three feet of the unit's location. Durability is my only concern, but so far so good through high temperatures and rain storms. I will also update in several months on this issue. Assuming my durability tests are satisfactory, I also will be buying a second unit for additional coverage.6. The nightime IR (infrared) works quite nicely as well.All in all I'd rate this unit as a superior value.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely impressed!", "Author": "NM", "ReviewID": "R2QSCUUES8D9FO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought a 2606, which I've been very pleased with, but Sharx definitely raised the bar with the 3605! It's everything the 2606 is, but with some huge enhancements:- Fully weatherproofed- Tremendous day/night performance. Thanks to a mechanical IR filter that slides in front of the cam, daylight color is perfect, while still offering outstanding nighttime vision. The array of IR LEDs illuminates well to around 100' away from my cam. And the ring of red lights looks menacing at night!- Even more firmware features than the 2606I have had the 3605 mounted for 3 winter months, and so far there hasn't been any problems at all. I will say it is a little larger than I expected, but it's still perfect for tucking under a gutter, and I was impressed the case is metal and the entire unit feels incredibly solid. My only complaint would be that the included mount isn't very versatile. An additional ball joint at the cam would help a lot, but nevertheless, the fact a mount and a bag of hardware is even included is only looking a gift-horse in the mouth!I was very pleased to find the Multi-Live software. It does a much better job of continuously monitoring the cameras than trying to use a browser. The browser works great, but the Multi-Live makes it even more convenient.I understand networking isn't easy for people that haven't done it before, but Sharx has done everything they can do to make it as easy as possible. If you're familiar with network addressing you _definitely_ won't have any problems.Since I didn't see it mentioned in the other reviews, I'd like to re-emphasize how important of a feature it is that this cam runs as a standalone server of it's own. For security, it's important that the data be uploaded to a remote site so that thugs can't simply destroy the camera or the DVR. All of Sharx's cams offer the ability to upload to email and FTP, while simultaneously recording to a _looping_ (so you don't have to keep clearing the card) on-board SD card, and now they'll even record to network attached storage. The motion-detection is the icing on the cake, so you can quickly scan the day's events without watching all of the video. There's even configurable interval snapshots, which has been amusing to string together to see a year's view from the cameras eye.I'd also like to add that in my experience, support has been second to none. It is email-based, but they respond extremely quickly, and I appreciate that you can tell they actually KNOW the product. You don't have to deal with a call-center that has never seen the product and just reads through the script.In summary, I did a lot of research before buying from Sharx, but I'm 100% convinced you absolutely cannot do any better for the money.

I purchased it based upon the user reviews, but wished there was a little more information to be found (i.e. a user manual download would have been great) so I thought I would add my own comments.Build quality, packaging, etc. is excellent. The physical attributes of the camera are sound. However, it was unknown exactly how the camera was connected to the power source. I was about to have an exterior GFCI outlet installed on the eaves of my garage, but upon opening the package found that, although the camera is weatherproof, there is a 'junction box' between the camera and the power brick which is not. I was expecting to mount the camera and plug it directly into an exterior outlet. Now I will be mounting it and running the cable through the wall to an interior outlet so that the junction box and plug stay nice and dry. It would have been nice to know that ahead of time. It was interesting that these details were written on a separate note inside the box and not the manual. This makes me wonder if this was a recent design change.Next to the setup. I have Verizon FIOS with their router wifi disabled, which then runs to a Netgear router acting as a wireless bridge. Needless to say the camera did not show up as a UPnP device, but it was fairly easy to find in the fios router network devices list and from there a simple next step to login and start configuring. I did note that the manual has to be read pretty carefully. Despite some text being labeled 'quickstart' my setup was NOT quick. I'm not a network geek, but can normally find settings if pointed in the right direction. The manual got me there in most cases, but I would think that you would need a GOOD working knowledge of network configuration and a SOLID understanding of how to find your way around your router. I would have a friend 'on call' if you're a novice in this area becuase I think the chances of getting stuck are highly likely. I did not have cause to email tech support, but there was some very reassuring text in the manual that basically says 'we won't let you fail'. A nice sentiment for sure.I have not yet mounted the camera in it's final spot, but hand carried it to the location to try. The wireless bridge is about 20-30 feet away and the signal strength was good enough at that range. The quality of the picture looks very good in night mode and I think it will be just what I need to keep an eye on our back driveway.Once past the initial setup, I've tinkered with some of the other settings such as alerts and email. Again, all look very comprehensive, but just not organized in the manual quite as well as they could be perhaps. It was good that the manual took me through a setup of a dynamic DNS name so that I can access the camera externally even if my fios router resets its IP address.Overall, it took a bit longer than I expected to get setup, but I'm pleased with the intitial result and look forward to getting in place permanently and using some of the advanced features to keep an eye on things.Hope this helps others in their decision.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superior Camera at an amazing price point", "Author": "wfl", "ReviewID": "R3FRD0U4REMRYC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sharx cameras are amazing value for money - I found this model extremely versatile for a variety of circumstances.

I was disappointed when I found Amazon stating unavailable.  I contacted Sharx and they inform me this is a temporary situation, but I could not wait and ordered from ['].  I just wanted to let everyone know, who like me want this product (now), that they can get it for $349.95 with free shipping.As other reviewers have stated, Sharx Security customer service is excellent.  Every E-mail question is thoroughly answered in a very short time.  For example, yesterday (Saturday) I asked about the electrical hookup and got a detailed reply with several pictures that gave me exactly what I needed to know.I look forward to receiving the camera and getting it installed.Update:Sharx Security SCNC3605 wireless IP outdoor camera with IR night vision review.Overall I am very happy with my purchase of this camera.  It satisfies my requirements and has some excellent features not found on similar products (e.g. recording to NAS without a PC).This is my first camera and it has been a learning experience.I recently installed a Linksys E2000 wireless router, which includes the latest `wireless-N' mode for compatible devices.  This camera is not such a device and seems to work best with the router set on 2.4GHz `wireless-G' mode.  The router had been working fine for 2 laptops and an iPod Touch, but the camera is barely stable with 1-2 bars of signal strength.  I choose the wireless model because I did not expect this to be an issue and running a 12V DC power cable seemed a simpler task than running a new Cat5e cable through the attic.  I'm going to have the Cat5 cabling done this week and turn off the wireless feature in the camera.  At the same time, I will have additional cable strung/dropped for future cameras, which will run with POE (power over Ethernet).I mention the above as a caveat to others who may be considering a wireless camera.  I am not faulting Sharx.  I can accept that something in my house is blocking a strong signal, but I would not recommend wireless. Be aware that there are operational issues when the camera cannot communicate at full speed: loss of connection; low fps and stream quality and \"picture freeze\" when an alarm causes the camera to write JPG/MOV files per the options.The POE option requires a special router (e.g. TRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switch (4x 10/100, 4x 10/100 PoE) currently less than $65 at Amazon.com).The only other issue that I had was with the electrical box that I purchased from Home Depot.  The connector for optional alarm system hookup is quite wide and will not fit through the cable port.  I just let it hang outside of the box and taped it up.  I have no use for it.  My local store did not have a choice, but I know the boxes are mode with a wider opening.I have DSL and the modem had been set to assign IP addresses.  I changed that to `bridge' mode to simplify the router configuration for the camera (which was then plug and play with the E2000).I went through the exercise of setting up DDNS (using no-ip.com free registration) but could not get the camera to connect to it.  Support insisted that I had mistyped the user name or password.  I then learned I don't need DDNS because a fixed IP address is included with my DSL service.My primary interest in getting the camera was to have a view of the front yard to see what the dogs are barking at while I am working at my desk.  That works fine if I have the browser or Multi-Live (included software) window open.  If not and what the dogs saw has passed out of frame, there is no quick and easy way to rewind and playback what I missed.  The camera description includes the term `DVR'. I am used to watching DirecTV with a DVR receiver, where I can pause and rewind live programs.  There is no such capability with this product.  Please post a reply if you know of a 3rd party camera viewer software that does.For me, installation was about 6 hours spread over 4 days.  Day 1 was working with the DSL modem and Linksys E2000 router. Day 2 was working with the camera pre-installation.  The manual provides detailed step by step instructions.  This was the easy part.  Day 3 was physical installation and running a wire through the attic for power.  I cut the AC adapter cable and spliced it to some phone wire I had on hand.Day 4 was post-installation; learning and trying out various options.  The final part was the addition of a Western Digital 2TB MyBookLive network attached storage (NAS) unit.  I changed the camera storage option from the included 4GB Micro-sd card to the NAS.  I have continuous recording, alarm (MOV) and periodic JPG output going to the NAS.  I created a special E-mail address for the alarm notification JPEG's.  I download those messages about once a day and they provide an index to the MOVie files on the NAS.I rate this camera highly and would recommend it or its POE cousin to anyone.  I've written about issues that could be taken as negatives, but I am posting this with the hope that someone else, knowing about these issues in advance, can have a better first experience with this product.Update 2:While I am waiting to get the camera on a Cat5e cable connection, Sharx Security tech support sent me camera configuration settings that address the \"picture freeze\" issue I was seeing during an alarm event.  So this camera on a weak wireless signal is still highly functional.  For that I changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "wireless outdoor camera", "Author": "TK", "ReviewID": "R1Q0Y6OOQC0NJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice camera, easy setup. a lot of really good features for alarms, recording etc.Additional followup, March 2012: Still in love with this camera. the image quality is great, at least that is the opinion of the sheriff (and mine) writing the burglary report at my house. The image of the woman that robbed my house was so clear there was no mistaking the identity of the thief. I was able to print the images and someone in the neighborhood recognized her and knew where to find her. The Sheriff was able to catch her in the act or robbing another house a few miles from me. I was able to produce the image and show the officer and point out which of the items in her car belonged to me. end of story in 26 hours. The best part of the story here is that while some of the video portion 'froze', I emailed the tech support at Sharx and was treated to 1. someone in the USA!!! 2. a tech person ('#15') that was very knowledgeable of the product and the router I use. We fine tuned the camera to get better video, better images and excellent remote viewing established. At the end of our fine tuning #15 explained to me the efforts Sharx is going through to bring the manufacturing of their products back to the USA, as they did with their tech support team.

Michael Phillips \"An R & D guy.\"", "ReviewID": "R2U0PKIJUA0IFY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our condo complex has been used as a dumping site for furniture, mattresses, and oil/paint for years. The cost of removal is very pricey. A few hundred dollars each month. So the most abused dump site I installed a Sharkx 3605N, 240 feet from my condo. The camera shoots down over the dump site. So many people still have not seen the camera. But the dumping has decreased significantly. So much that the camera paid for itself in only a couple of months. The long distance was covered using wireless, but not the wireless supplied on the camera. I used a very powerful router and a directional antenna to make the signal and reliability to my wireless router, excellent, in all weather conditions. This install also has to shoot through several 20 foot high trees. The directional antenna is the AIR802 Professional Yagi 8dbi antenna. The powerful router is the Amped Wireless SR10000. This router uses 1 of it's 2 antennas far more than the other. That's where I attached the Yagi antenna. It made a solid difference in the signal level compared to the other antenna on the SR10000. This setup has worked well through spring and summer. Winter performance here in California is yet to be seen.Sharkx does have great customer email service. I had to use it many times. Their cameras are very capable. This means I had to learn all of the extensive features. It was worth it. When I went on vacation out of state, I could check the dumping site. When more garbage was dumped, I just worked my way through the videos stored on the camera until I found the culprits. Then I downloaded the video to my cell phone to save it. This particular location of camera, fills the 32gb sd card in about 1 week. My goal was to have 2 weeks of storage. In one of my emails to customer service, they told me that they could increase the capacity of the number of video files stored from 1000 to 2000. That took the camera storage to 2 weeks! I was very pleased. A large part of what determines how long the sd card takes to fill up, is how well the alarm motion detection windows were set. They are used to screen out the motion of trees and things that would otherwise needlessly trigger the camera to start recording. The file size can be adjusted as well. These items take some tuning so the sd card lasts as long as possible before filling up. When it does fill up, the oldest video files are recorded over first. They emailed me the upgraded firmware. But alas it was for only my camera's mac address, and no other. So each camera had to get it's own firmware upgrade mailed by customer service. All of my Sharx cameras use 32gb micro sd cards. According to Sharks, all sd cards that are supplied by the customer have to be formatted with a little app from sdcard dot org slash downloads. When used correctly, it tests the sd card during formatting for any flaws. All of my Sharx cameras are now upgraded to the 2000 file size. The firmware is rev 4.35.After the successes and a learning curve, I bought 4 more Sharkx IP cameras. I have 3 3605N's and 2 2700's for the complex. More are required. They each have the exact same lens and electronics. It's just that the cases are different depending on weather you want indoor or outdoor versions. In one location, I wanted the camera to be as hidden as possible. It's tucked up under the roof eave. It's the indoor 2700. It cannot be rained on. But I used scotch tape over the micro sd slot to keep the dust out. This is obviously not recommended by Sharkx, but it's doing it's job just fine. The outdoor 3605N's are solid white and fairly visible, and harder to hide than the indoor versions like the 2700. I will be painting the 3605N's to match the buildings.The manual that came with each camera is very detailed. In fact, it is so detailed that I was a bit over whelmed at first.

Poler", "ReviewID": "R1QZ45DFJ21609", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching many different setups and manuals, I ordered two of these cameras. They are incredibly well made, solid metal construction.The installation manual is written in plain English and is easy to digest. Initial setup on the bench took about 15 minutes; it's all pretty straightforward, but it helps to have a good understanding of networking (i.e. if you know what DHCP, routers, and HTTP are, you're in good shape).Getting the cameras mounted outside was the most time consuming part. A plastic weatherproof junction box from Home Depot or Lowes serves very well for this purpose -- the cables go in through a hole on the side, and the camera's mount bolted to the box cover. The only problem with this setup is one of the cable connectors is fairly wide, and you need to drill a fairly large hole in the side of the box to accommodate it; nothing a little silicone sealant can't solve. It's hard to figure out how to power the cameras, you may have to do some trickery on that front. They provide a \"wall wart\" power adapter with an extra long cord, but you'll need to figure out a weatherproof location to place it.Perhaps the best part of these cameras, however, has been in dealing with Sharx Security's tech support. I encountered involving random reboots of one of the cameras. Sharx answers E-Mails in less than 30 minutes **ON A SUNDAY**. That's just outstanding. Their responses were clear, friendly, and helpful, suggesting multiple things to try and multiple possible resolutions to my issue, up to and including offering to replace the camera if it would help (it turned out to not even be the camera's fault, other factors in play).

I purchased a second one when it became available. The new one, which I just received this past week, has a new wiring setup. Instead of having a bundle of different connection wires from the camera, there is now only one wire which plugs into a converter box that all the other connection type wires plug into. Makes for a neater instillation. Also I think the wire to the power source is longer. The other change is that the software has been upgraded to give more storage options.Set up with a linksys router to work over the internet is very hard. The auto plug and play does not work with a linksys. As a matter of fact, I was unsuccessful to get the camera to work over the internet with my router. After trying for a week, I finally contacted customer support. They emailed me back right away, and I ended up granting them remote access to my router and they had it working in about 5 minutes. Once I saw the settings they used it was very easy for me to get my new camera set up. Took me 5 minutes. If you can't get yours to work with your linksys router you can comment me and I can tell you how to do it. Googling for this info is useless because there is so much bad information out there. I can't stress how knowledgeable support is, and the info they supply in the booklet. They go into detail how to get a DN so you can use the same 'link' over the internet even if your IP address changes. They also discuss how to set up an ftp server if you want to send pictures automatically to your PC or to a hard drive on your network and to have pictures sent automatically to gmail.They supply you with a CD that has two programs on it. One is just to detect your camera on your network, and the other is to view your camera(s). Since I have two now, when I click the link to the program, two of the 4 'boxes' have my cam1 and cam2. You can also just open two browsers for the two cams, but you do not hear audio over the internet. The 'Multilive' software has audio.The two programs on the CD didn't set themselves up that smoothly, for some reason the programs only detected my new camera. But it was easy to manually add my first camera, just typed in the intranet IP and assigned it which box to display in.The camera comes with an SD card that you can have the camera record to. The biggest pain for me is, I download the video which is great, but it takes a couple minutes to download. It is sloooow. I would like to just get the SD card and pop it into the reader and into my computer, but it is to much of a pain to get the SD card. Have to unscrew the front of the camera to get it and I can't be bothered, I can't reach the camera that easily.In summary:ProsHas a great picture either with light or in pitch darkness of night.Good remote interface on you PC with many options to tweek the video.Records video with many options how, such as 'On Aarm', and where to record the video.Great mounting hardware, easy to install.The IT info is very good and explained in a way that non network people can understand.Customer support is great.ConsIt is hard to figure out how to get it to work over the internet with a linksys router for the first time.Downloading the video remotely from the SD card takes a long time and getting the SD card to get the video fast, usually isn't practical.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a Mack Truck sized security hole", "Author": "I.

This is important because in this review I am going to talk only about cons.- The camera arrives with 4mm (focal length) lens. In my specific case with distance to the object 120 feet the lens does a reasonable job, but 8mm lens would be much better. This was my first video camera and I did not quite understand implications of short vs long fixed focal length. Before I bought the camera I asked the seller what camera they recommend assuming the said distance to the object. Their recommendation was SCNC3605N. I learned that it is not the best option in my case. Appears that it is hard to find after market lens for this camera.- Camera does not allow continuous writing to FTP server (at least I could not find how to do it), only to NAS or SD. It is possible to upload to FTP server up to 5 JPG shoots per second from the alarm section.- Would be great to get SSH (is it Linux behind the HTTP front end?) and allow managing without browser and HTTP.- When recording on Class 10 SD card at maximum quality 30fps it is close to impossible to upload a large (10 minutes) clip. Keep the files small (30sec - 1min) and/or use lower frame rate. Also it is possible to disable recording while you upload a clip.- I planned to connect the camera to a solar panel with a battery backup. Power spec of the camera is rather high. Power supply is 1A which probably means that you will need 500-700ma. I did not measure the actual current with and without IR yet. Assuming 500ma the solar panel and  battery kit is going to be rather large and expensive. The kits I have found start at $150- The camera manual recommends QuickTime. VLC (VideoLan) plays the MOV file and audio alright.- The camera is expensive. IP cameras are expensive toys and this one is rather higher end. Software is great, but the price tag it carries really bites the pocket. The camera is not really wireless - you still need power supply. If you are planning to install more than one camera consider generally cheaper CCTV. There are many CCTV cameras on the market to choose from including cameras which allow to change focal length.

Instructions as other have said are very well written.  Only thing I found lacking in the documentation was in some of the advanced setup - such as setting thresholds and sensitivity on the alarm - so you just have to mess with this until you get it the way you like it - overall is pretty self explanatory.  Night viewing is pretty good - however someone did give me a tip that if you paint the underside of the \"sunshade\" in flat black spray paint it will help reduce the glare - as if you leave it you might see a \"halo\" with the reflection of the lens.  I haven't done this yet - however believe this will take care of that problem.Unlike others I have had a couple of outages - I haven't had to do an actual reset of the camera but have had to unplug and plug it back in for it to work again - not sure if this is caused by power outages (which I have fairly frequently) and it not coming back up right - or what is causing it but over 3 months it has only happened about twice.The video quality of this camera is excellent - and the ability for you to access this camera from anywhere is great - using LiveCams (lots of other apps I am sure as well) on my iphone I am able to always see what is going on when I need to.This purchase was to test it out - and it so far has proven to be very reliable and high quality - so I plan on installing a second one this spring.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Initial view", "Author": "dwpsharky", "ReviewID": "R2VXVDT8R3IS7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Camera has good picture quality and easy setup as far as viewing over internet.

This is a heavy, metal, premium quality camera.  It is not in the same league as the other cameras on Amazon.  Most are light weight, with poorly written user guides and useless support.  The Sharx manual is clearly written and includes step-by-step instructions (with pictures) that will take you from the beginning to the end of the installation.  Not one single step is omitted (some are even repeated).  And the only thing better than the Sharx camera or manual is Sharx Support.  Over the decades, for both work and pleasure, I've contacted tech support from more companies, more times than most folks.  These guys are at the top.  It's interesting that the contact page on their website only has fields for your contact info, with no place to describe your issue or ask a question.  That's because in few minutes your phone will ring and you will personally helped by a friendly person located right here in America.  If you are the least bit reluctant as to weather on not you are qualified to set one of these up by yourself, be assured - you won't be doing it alone.  They will do whatever they can to help you.  I've even gotten instant replies to questions I've emailed over the weekend.As for the camera itself; Image quality is outstanding, night vision works very well and out to about 100 feet, Wi-fi range is ample for most any installation, and they just simply work flawlessly with Mac (and PC) smart phones or tablets.

Then it started having color problems. The daytime colors were off everything was pinkish. I emailed sharx support, and they told me right from the beginning that they would resolve the problem and not to worry. They upgraded the firmware to see if that would resolve the problem, but it didn't. Two days later, I had a new camera at my house. Installed the camera and it worked great! A few months later, I was getting some connection problems with the camera; it wouldn't always show up on my router. I figured something was going wrong with the camera, and was kind of disappointed that I might have to send another camera back to them. Sharx support was very helpful and even asked me if I wanted to try to trouble shoot it or if I just wanted them to send me a new camera. I thought that was very outgoing to ask me what I wanted to do. So in return, I left the decision up to them. They ended up upgrading the firmware to the latest and we found my wireless router channel spacing setting was off and that could cause problems.

Before you mount the camera, you must hook it directly to your wireless modem with an ethernet cable (provided) and follow the instructions to set up the wireless capabilities.  You also have to set up the ability to view the camera picture via both your network IP address AND it's internet IP address (so you can see it when you are away from your home WIFI network by going to the internet IP address from any computer). Mounting the cameras took about 30 minutes and was quite easy.  Getting the computer network aspect working took several hours.  I sent an email question to Sharx and they responded immediately with the help I needed to figure out one part.  Please note that you will want to set up a free internet host account at one of the sites recommended in the manual so you can view away from home without having to locate your home network IP, which changes over time based on new assignments from you internet provider.

After reading all the reviews and ignoring the irate customers who couldn't figure it out, this one still stood out.The camera itself is much bigger than I expected and is very, very solid. This camera has additional connectors for integration with a burglar alarm system which, although I am not using them, made me feel a bit more certain that this is a camera that I am not going to outgrow anytime soon. I didn't have many problems mounting the camera. It's installed under a soffit so it's actually upside down and I had to move the sunshade to account for this. Installation is the one area where the otherwise excellent documentation falls a little flat, but I am not mechanically inclined so it's probably just my own issue.My camera is mounted on a detached garage. I originally thought my wifi would be sufficient, but I had lots of timeouts and very laggy video. I installed a wifi range extender and that really didn't help much either. Finally, I got some powerline AV ethernet adapters to run ethernet over my home electrical wiring and installed a separate hub in the garage for this camera to connect to. This worked like a charm although I'm not actually using this as a wireless camera anymore. Fortunately, you can disable Wireless in the interface so I went ahead and did that.During the daytime, the video is crisp and clear. I initially had problems with the nighttime view being \"foggy\" and for a minute I thought this was just the way it was going to have to be. Then...I read the manual! I removed the sunshade and it got much better.

Finally I decided to bite the bullet and spring for the Sharx, hoping the price was in fact indicative of the quality. Turns out it is!!!  The product is very well made using heavy gauge metals and good hard rubbers and plastics. Documentation is thorough and well done. I'm on a mac so the included software wasn't an option and frankly isn't needed. I do everything through a browser. In short, it's a great product and I highly recommend it.Now for the service part. While setting the camera up for something else, I accidentally set the camera to have a fixed IP address which caused the camera to drop off my network and I lost contact with it. Obviously, I was distraught and was scrambling for an answer. I went through the manual and checked online but found nothing. So I contacted the company via email. They responded promptly by email with several things I could try. Over the course of the next few days, they stayed in close contact via both email and phone calls to help me solve my problem, which they did. This was not cursory customer service done because they \"have to\". It seemed like they took it very personally that i was having an issue and that it was their obligation to get me back up and running.

Contact us with any questions, no matter how simple or how complicated.\" And every word of that pledge is true.About 3 months ago I purchased another camera - a Wansview  ($52.50) from Amazon - to set up a wireless view of the ocean at my vacation home.There I have Uverse installed plus three different wireless networks and two routers. The layout of the house was such that I couldn't cover every place with one network. Besides that, I am a Mac user and the software that comes with the camera is for PCs. Anyway after many hours working with a local IT person, we were unable to get it working correctly, in spite of his expertise and the very many helpful reviews and comments on Amazon. We could get a picture, but couldn't get the wireless poked through the network and web accessible from a remote location. With this camera, there was no technical support, and in fact, no intelligible website to help me further. I put it back in the box and my brand new Wansview camera sits in my shop unused.I decided to try another camera.After reading the reviews of the Sharx cameras - along with comments about their excellent technical support - I purchased a SCNC3605N camera. It costs much more than the original camera. It came in a few days and the initial set up instructions were excellent - there were even special instructions for Mac users. But I still had trouble getting the camera to be viewed on the web because of my unusual network/Uverse setup and because I didn't know anything about how my Uverse system worked. I sent an email to Sharx and within a few hours, I received a return telephone call from Sharx.I worked with the tech support person (he told me his was support person #18, no name!) for almost 6 hours off and on over 2 days on the telephone. He was trying to figure out the system long distance, and I just followed along and made changes to the router and Uverse as he suggested. Several times he mentioned \"we're only supposed to provide 30 minutes of telephone support\" but still we just plowed ahead.Sum total: we got it working and the camera produces excellent pictures, accessible 24/7 on the web. The camera has only been up a few weeks, but it has survived 7 inches of rain and days of 100+ degree heat. It appears to me to be excellently made, and I suspect that it will last for many years.If you're trying to sort out which camera to buy, go ahead and buy a Sharx.

I configured the camera for wifi and mounted it outside, after buying an outdoor plug and housing for around 20 dollars from the hardware store.  I bought a waterproof housing with a lid that can accommodate a padlock and the adapter and other plugs fit within the housing.

I had intermittent remote connections issues since I bought it. One of the best things about it was the ability to access live video and replay recorded video remotely from office 45 miles away.For some reason, it sends me still pictures on a set schedule like it configured it but I can't access it remotely any more. It lost the remote accessability about a month after I bought it.I had a couple of conversations with the Sharx tech support but they were ultimately unable to help me and never got back to me after my latest email. I was going to buy 3 more of these but unless they respond, I'll probably have to look elsewhere.******** Update March 2013*******After 4 months of frustruation, I decided to email Sharx and ask them how to return the camera for a refund. They thought that the camera was fine but my IP address was changing. What was maddening was when I checked the IP address, it was always the same however, what I didn't know at the time is that the IP address was in fact changing every few days for remote access. Tech support suggested that I try a couple more things.I had to follow the Sharx Manual instructions entitled Manual Setup Step 2: Configuring your Router to allow Remote Access. Then I had to do Step 3, Choosing a name for your Camera on the internet, and finally, I had to do step 4 to allow automatic updating of my camera's internet ip address. The only way that I got thru this was with some pretty solid support from Sharx tech support. I really have to hand it to them, At first I had given the camera 2 Stars but after all their support, the camera is finally operating correctly. When my issue was finally resolved, I was in my 5th month of ownership and technically out of warranty support. However, since I had the issue since I bought the camera, I believe Sharx cut me some slack. The other good thing was that I kept talking to the same person at tech support throughout my entire ordeal. He would never give me his name, which I thought was odd, but he was professional and courteous at all times. I wish the camera was like more plug-and-play, but it does work once all it's settings are configured properly. Thank you Sharx for standing by me. I highly doubt I would've received such thourough service anywhere else. Although the camera works as advertised and tech support was outstanding, it was too difficult to set up so unfortunately, I can't give it 5 Stars. I guess now that it's operating correctly, I could give it 4 Stars. If you have the time and are better than average tech savvy, than this camera could be right for you. If you live 1 hour away from where you'll be setting the camera up, you might want to find another camera due to it's difficulty in set-up. Or better yet, set it up in your own back yard temporarily for at least a month in case you have trouble.A final comment that I'd like to make is that when you're watching the live feed from your camera, there should be a way to make the picture make bigger or be able to close-up on something.

I had planned on it this past Friday but as usual, life got in the way. Up to that day I had contacted their support at least a half dozen times and in every case, they answered all questions in very friendly and super timely manner. Today I sent three more questions in one email and decided to run to the store, I received a response before I even got out of my driveway, maybe 15 minutes at most.One of the questions was regarding the length of the power supply cable, which they told me is 10 feet, but they suggested low voltage cable, such as the cable used for a doorbell in a house, and can extend it to no more than 30 feet. They then went on to say that if I wanted to do POE, then 300 feet is doable for power and they have the option for $49.95. The cool thing is I have a couple of really good POE switches that cover the power requirements of the camera so I can eliminate the normal power cable and go with POE and Ethernet and get more length, they say up to 300 feet, which is the max run of a single ethernet run anyway, but you can extend that by adding another switch and can do that a total of 3 times.Another question is motion detection. One thing I have not see anywhere is how motion detection can be configured. According to support, there are 4 separate sections available in a square/rectangular pattern and each can have it's sensitivity set differentlyFor me the 30 foot is plenty so I'll probably stay with the wireless option for this purchase. In the end, customer support means a lot these days. I've spent many years as a customer support rep and manager and it's rare anymore to get this kind of support, especially since I have not even purchased the camera just yet and yes, I did tell them I have not purchased it yet and I was just gathering info on what it can do and what I may need for the installationSo once again, based on others that have reviewed the functionality of the camera itself and the reviews of their support and my own experiences I really do feel I am making a great choiceOnce I have the camera, get it installed, I'll come back and give a very detailed report of what it can do and what I did with it.11/26/2012 UPDATED - This is an email I just sent to their support. I did  not need to use their support at all for configuring this camera and as I said above, I had asked them several questions PRIOR to me purchasing this camera====== Start email to Sharx Support ======Greetings,I hope everyone there had a great Thanksgiving.I just wanted to drop you a note saying that I did finally purchase the 3605N and absolutely love it. The manual that comes with it is well thought out and very detailed. Even with my experience in networking (I'm a CCIE with Wireless, VoIP, Security and the standard Switching specialties), the manual gave me very specific information regarding best practices for the various settings available. A good example is the NAS setup, which explains the various file sizes at various settings, the ability to configure 4 different \"Motion Detection Windows\" and set them individually. I could go on and on.I love the ability to have multiple video streams that can be based on whatever I want, but the default settings work extremely well for my needs. I love the ability to dig down through \"Storage\", which in my case is a Apple Time Machine (older one with 1TB of space) I can always go right to the Time Machine if I want but browsing using the \"Browse Storage\" tool makes it so much easier. I am also using email alarms which, once again works perfectly and the manual makes it easy for even a novice to configure. How do I know, that's easy, I have a sister that is good on a computer, you could call her and mid-level user, but when it comes to doing anything even remotely changing any settings, she has no clue (yes, she is a mac user as well, my whole family is and our oldest piece of equipment is 2 yrs old but we have been using MAC for years). Anyway, just to see how well the manual works for a novice, I talked her into setting up the email and NAS. As expected I had to give her the settings but only did it when she asked for it while she was reading the manual, and she nailed it the first time for both configurations without any help from me. May hats off to the person(s) that came up with the manual.In regards to the overall configuration settings, this is about as detailed as you can get at this price range, my hat is off to the software developer(s) as well. I am an experienced developer for iOS and I understand the work that goes into something like this, especially for cross platform stuff. I understand it's html or a version thereof, maybe with some Java and certainly Active X (the included Windows software on the CD-ROM which I believe is called MultiView, but still, to make it stable for a host of browsers is still hard work.I am so impressed with the quality of the camera, the ability to setup many settings to my liking, and the pre-sales support you have given me, I have just purchased 3 more to replace three other, much cheaper cameras. I believe in you get what you pay for and in this case, I am really, really happy with my decision.====== End email to Sharx Support ======As you can see, you cannot go wrong with buying this camera. I know it's not exactly cheap but in my opinion, it is well worth the extra cost. I'll be selling the three Foscam 8905W's in the Amazon store once the other three I just ordered show up.

We used the camera indoors to monitor the dogs while we were out at work.  The camera worked wonderfully until I purchased a new router - a Buffalo.  The camera stopped working with AES+ TKIP on that router - so I contacted Sharx Security.  The response was almost immediate - I don't think I had been away from my desk more than an hour before I got a response back with details on what was causing my fault.  We determined that the way the Router handled the AES- TKIP was the issue, but Sharx Security offered to connect remotely and do a Firmware update to the camera.  They spent a lot of time helping me, but in the end I returned the Buffalo (which caused me other issues anyway) and replaced it with a NETGEAR WNDR4500.  Since that point on the camera was flawless in operation once more.  Happily sitting in the Texas heat with not a single glitch.Over this past weekend we moved the camera outside so we could monitor the entrance to our driveway.  We installed it on a pole, installed the previously left in the box sun shade and all was working wonderful until the evening when the Infrared kicked in - we had fogging!  You could not see a thing for this white haze.  Condensation was my first thought, but no - nothing.  I had long since lost the manual, so I was at a loss to whether there was some adjustment that needed to be made.  So another email was sent to Sharx Security.  My camera was well out of the support window by now, so I was not too hopeful.  Boy was I surprised.  No more than an hour had passed when I got an email from Sharx Security explaining that the sun shade causes glare if it is mounted too far forward - and could I check to see if mine was.  Low and behold it was and a quick adjustment later the camera is once again exceeding my expectations.Sharx Security is a great company with a great product.

It was an expensive purchase for myself, but after getting my garage tagged (in a neighborhood where that normally doesn't happen) made me feel vulnerable. So instead of paying for an expensive monthly alarm system, I opted for the SCNC3605N security camera. There were a lot of options to choose from on amazon, but the Sharx Security brand stood out above the rest. Setting up the camera was a cinch, though I'm no beginner when it comes to technology. I put all the setting to max and ran the camera for a couple of months. After a while the camera started causing my router to bug out. I'd be resetting the camera, the router and even ran a cat5e cable instead of the wifi option. Nothing seemed to fix it. I usually don't like dealing with customer service because more often than not the person doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground. After sending a form from the Sharx Security website, I was greeted with a reply about a day later. After telling them my problem, we tried to work out what was wrong. I have to say this guy knew what he was talking about. I swear he could have been the guy to build the camera and software himself. At one point I thought we'd never figure it out and if I had to I could sent it to them. Eventually he asked me to tune the settings down to the recommended ones. I wasn't too happy about doing that, but it solved all the problems I was having with my network. So it didn't stop there. A little while later I was trying to set up the camera so I could log into it from work. Again I was greeted with a plethora of information. I felt like the CSR on the other end was almost enthused to give me all kinds of information about VPN's and what's the most secure method to access my network. I even ended up buying another router for work that he recommended to me (which was also a really good choice!). After trading some emails back and forth I settled for using the VPN setting on my router. It's worked great and I'm happy knowing that there's some encryption going back and forth so my network can't easily be snooped (even if I don't have anything worth snooping).

I was a bit concerned since I use a Windows Laptop with an Apple Router but my concerns were unnecessary.  Other reviews noted this was exceptionally easy to set up.  I had it out of the box and set up in less than an hour (wired to the router).  Getting the wifi working and finishing the set up to actually work from the garage took less than another hour.  I played with motion detection, recording, and the email alerts for a couple of days, fine tuning the settings to get the camera to give me what I needed.  While the camera is a bit on the pricey side, from my perspective it is well worth it.  The camera comes with probably the best User's Guide I have ever seen.  It is written in plain English, which is unusual these days.  Most User Manual are written by techies for techies and the novice struggles. Not is this case.  If you read the directions and follow them carefully setting up this camera is a \"no brainer\".  I am saving my money so I can buy a couple more of these cameras.
