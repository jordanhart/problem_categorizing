It captured colors vividly...more vividly than the eye could see underwater.  However, a huge drawback is the horrible battery life.  I had charged the new batteries exactly as the manual instructed, but got only 55 pictures before my battery died (far less than the average 100 that the camera specs promise).  The battery died on me partway through my second dive.  That's a really poor design since almost all days of diving include 2 dives and changing batteries between dives isn't possible since the casing will not have fully dried enough to open.  Whether operating on land or sea, you really need at least 2 batteries and will need to charge them both daily if taking many pictures.I wasn't as impressed with the picture quality on land.  Although a 3x optical zoom is common on digital cameras, I prefer a stronger zoom.  I also found the camera somewhat frustrating to operate.  For example, when I turn the camera on, I'm not immmediately able to zoom and take a picture...I have to give the camera at least 5 seconds to warm up before the zoom will work.  Five seconds may not sound like a lot, but it feels like a lot when you're trying to quickly snap a picture.I wouldn't buy this with the expectation that the camera is high enough quality to double as you normal on-land digital camera.The external flash is easy to use and does make the difference in getting good underwater pictures.", "Date": "July 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Underwater Starter Camera", "Author": "The Chief", "ReviewID": "R2U4AISHLUNSUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for diving trips to New Zealand and Puerto Rico. For the cost, this was a great camera. Taken out of the waterproof housing, the 6.1 megapixel camera fits very nicely in your pocket or purse. My wife had the larger SLR camera so we used that for the grand pictures and kept this smaller camera for the quick shots or if the SLR was not avaialbe, say like on a hike up a mountain or down into a cave.Underwater the flash really brings out the colors and works well. We used both the movie and picture mode underwater. The flash attaches to the camera housing and there is a leash. The whole assemply was neutrally boyant so we did not have a problem with it getting in the way. I attached it to a clib on my BCD and it was always there when I wanted it.Make sure to buy extra memory cards as you will be filling them up quickly with this camera ;)Enjoy", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "DC 600 ProSet includes SL 960 External Flash, SL 962 Flash Link, SL 946 Soft Travel Case\n6.1 MP (2848 x 2136 resolution) for crisp, colorful underwater pictures, 2.5\" LCD Monitor, AVI Movie mode @ 30 FPS\n3X optical/4X digital zoom, 12 Land Modes + Sea Exposure Mode with White Balance for richer color\nSpy Mode for nature shots allows continuous shots at pre-set time intervals\nEngnomic rubber armored housing rated to 200ft/60m, uses SD memory card up to 1GB, Expandable with other Sealife Accessories", "Name": "Sealife Digital Pro Set Underwater Dive Camera with External Flash (DC 600 ProSet)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HGGSABZGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000KZY268"}}
