First off it arrived very quickly and all items were included.  No issues! I have waited a long time to purchase a new camera and I finally settled on this one after loads of research.  It was a great deal getting all the extras included for the same price as the camera alone. This camera is the best. It is so simple to use it has more effects and scene settings than I have seen on a camera. There is no way to screw up a pic w/ this one.  I love how quickly it snaps a picture, seems to be no delay.  Which is great when you have a toddler running around.  The manual is short and sweet, easy to remember. I have a friend who bought a more expensive SLR camera, who after using mine feels she over purchased.  This camera does everything the more expensive cameras do, and it offers so many different settings.  Her's does not offer any of those things. The quality of the photos in any light are excellent. The zoom is amazing. I can't believe what a great buy this wonderful camera is.  It is well worth the money and then some.  I have never considered myself to have an eye for photos.  With this camera, I can take professional quality photos.  I may have a new found passion for photography thanks to this camera!!!!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Warren C.
