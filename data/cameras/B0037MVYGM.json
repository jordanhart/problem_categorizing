Mounted near a doorway or entry and looking at it at very close range, it is difficult to tell it is a dummy.  Easy to install.  Plastic construction throughout so I would recommend mounting in a protective area if used outside.  Direct sunlight on the body will most likely cause the finish to dull out and eventually the plastic will crack.  Otherwise, this model is very good for indoors and limited uses in protective areas on a building's exterior.  If you do mount it outside, I would guess you would get about a year or two of use before it falls apart. I gave it a 5 star if used inside.  If used outside figure a 3 star. There is also a small label that says it is a fake cam but you can peel it off the body with no damage to the nice plastic finish.  Remove it before installing.

For the price, I couldn't be happier.I mounted one pointing down the stairs at my girlfriends apartment. You could not miss it from the bottom of the stairs (where I also had a \"Property Under Surveillance\" sign). The typical thief will not risk going in for a closer look.Some tips:- Mount it where it is easily seen from the place where a would-be thief will initially see your house(the driveway/sidewalk/street, not the front porch)- Mount it high on a wall. This way, it can be seen from a distance and it cannot be easily examined closely.- You can remove the batteries if you don't like the flashing LED. I don't know how many real cameras do this.- You may want to rough-up the ball in the mount with a file or sandpaper if it won't stay in place.- Buy some stickers/signs that warn that the property is under surveillance.- Finally, consider buying a real camera if warranted.Hope this helps!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "miss muckle", "ReviewID": "R3ET0TANHGSMRK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At a glance it looks like the real thing...my intention was to discourage someone looking into the entry way of the building and have them move on to another location and I think it will work.

Come to find out we bought a home in an area of Oklahoma famous for meth-heads & burglaries. Unfortunately, the law is far and few between and stretched to their limits, so we had to take action after-the-fact to protect our home. We installed an alarm system and purchased these cameras as more of a deterent by placing one on each corner outside of our house. The neighbors took notice and can't tell whether they are real or faux (and we're not telling!). We also purchased two street signs that say, \"You and Your Vehicle Are Being Monitored By Closed Circuit TV\", and posted them on each side of the street. Since then the traffic down at the end of our street has been cut by 50%.We heard just today there may be a break in our case and of course, most likely the people down the street are responsible for the break-in & burglary. These cameras have been great in function and professional looking enough to help stop unwanted traffic and put these criminals on notice they are being watched. They were so affordable (a real bargain) considering how much we already lost monetarily from the break-in. I can't wait for the day when we can afford the real thing.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "SecurityMan SM-3601S Dummy Indoor Camera with LED (Silver)", "Author": "Roberto", "ReviewID": "R25UI38EN1AXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As described in the website.
