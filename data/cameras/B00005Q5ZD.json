The movie feature is also fun and the software lets you make small movies that you can add music to.  All this without hardly reading the instruction manual!

Later I will move on to a more complicated one.  Anyway I disagree with all of you who did not like the software.  I use software all the time and this is the first photo software that did what I want.  I agree with all the good things said before in other reviews.  If anything is wrong it is the drain on regular batteries so I bought the rechargeable ones.  The fact I could use the camera as a pc cam was an unexpected plus.  I think the main use of the camera is for doing e-mail, short videos and taking photos of people or things you want to display on the net.  I would never expect to shoot a long shot to a stage as one person did.  When you consider the size and all the features Fuji has packed into it, what a buy!

And the pictures are beautiful.However, the software is AWFUL, bad to install, doesn't give you any choices on anything, but works, more or less, if you can get it installed.  The controls on this lightweight little camera are not overly intuitive, either.  And if you're using regular batteries and want preview mode on, carry a lot of spares. I've heard the rechargeables are much better, but I haven't tried them yet.The flash is about what I would expect from a camera in this price range.  It's good for pictures within about a 10 foot range.All the negatives asides, the picture clarity and color is outstanding and I would buy the same camera again in a heartbeat.  The zoom features (once you figure them out) are really remarkable for a camera in this price range.  I would recommend this camera at this price to a family member or any amateur photographer who wants to take quality pictures.", "Date": "February 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good Value for Money", "Author": "LMK", "ReviewID": "R3IPGC108ROILX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera, and I was not disappointed.

While I was not really in the market for a digicam, I just went for it being I do not own a camera and I needed one for an upcoming event.I am happy I did.  The camera works very well.  Pictures look great, both indoors and out.  The interface is simple to use and taking pictures is a breeze, even for beginners.  Lucky for me I have several SmartMedia cards laying around from my old MP3 player.  With an 128M card I can take 997 pictures at lowest resolution/lowest quality or 166 pictures at highest resolution/highest quality.  I figure 166 pictures is like five rolls of film so I just jack up the settings to high and get great pics, perfect for printing, then resize them if I want to post them on the web or send them in email.The only compliant I have is night shots.  I live outside of Manhattan and wanted to take some shots of the skyline.  Unfortunately even with in nighttime mode, the shots of the skyline we blurry.  You need a very steady hand or a tripod to work with the slow shutter speed of nighttime mode.  Also this camera lacks optical zoom, still you would be hard pressed to find a digital camera for under $200 that offers it.  The camera does offer digital zoom, but to be honest, digital zoom is a gimmick.Bottom line, if you are looking for a inexpensive digital camera, this is it.  If you want a professional level camera, you are going to have to spend more but you will get more features like optical zoom.", "Date": "August 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "Very good camera!", "Author": "Mitch Clark", "ReviewID": "R1UQWXQ6R2E9WY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for use on vacation.

No other camera comes close to its picture quality at this price. It takes fantastic outdoor pictures! Taking good indoor pictures can be challenging but is possible. Here are some hints I've found helpful: - Keep your subject within flash range, about 8 ft or so. - Avoid dusty environments. The glowing orbs you see is caused by the flash hitting dust particles. - Switch the camera to Manual mode and experiment with the White Balance before you need to take that important shot. That way you can familiarize yourself with the different light settings and how they affect your picture. - Buy a bigger Smartmedia card (mine is 128 MB) and take lots of experimental shots. You don't need to pay for film development so just keep shooting and erasing. - Check and compare your pictures on a high quality computer monitor rather than the camera's LCD so you can actually see any subtle differences in color, lighting, etc. - Buy rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger. Buy the highest capacity batteries you can afford (at least 1600 mah). - Remember, these are digital pictures. You can always use some sort of graphic imaging software to touch-up your photos if they are too dark or you don't like the color. And remember, the primary function of this camera is to take digital pictures. It's not webcam nor a video recorder.
