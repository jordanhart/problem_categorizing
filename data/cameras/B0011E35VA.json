{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cool features but bad photo quality", "Author": "Ana\u00efs V.", "ReviewID": "RPFSCZ1BW8CUZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera after testing it in several different stores. I was drawn to the many different options avaiable to choose from, including the one that automatically takes the photo as soon as the subject smiles. The colours on the large LCD screen were beautiful and extremely close to the items I took pictures of. So I bought the camera, thinking I would be very happy with it.That night, I took quite a few photos indoors and, the next day, took some shots outside. I also experimented with the macro and supermacro modes and finally uploaded all the pictures to the computer. I thought there was some sort of error in uploading when I saw how most of the pictures looked. I deleted them from the computer and reloaded them, hoping that that there had been some sort of error the first time. Unfortunately, that was not the case.The photos were very washed out once on the computer as well as when they were printed, though they had appeared beautifully on the screen. After checking around, I found that this seems to be a major plague of this camera. Also, though the macro mode produced some good photos (despite the colouration), the supermacro mode produced photos of very poor quality.I give this camera 3 stars mainly because of how easy it is to use and the many different settings available, as well as the decent speed of taking photos. However, the fact that the actual pictures are not of very decent quality knocks off a star and the other lost star is due to the fact that many of the available settings don't really add much to the camera overall. For instance, the mode that takes a photo instantly once the subject smiles does not operate that well. The subject must stay still for a few seconds and, if they move even slightly, the camera will have to reposition and reset itself before it takes the picture, wasting quite a bit of time in the process. However, since the actual picture quality is more important than the bells and whistles, I returned this camera shortly after purchasing it.", "Date": "May 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera with lots of options", "Author": "Honda Mom 99 \"Carrie\"", "ReviewID": "R3QXIX1V87FQCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.  My husband and I replaced an old Kodak and did a lot of research to find something decent for our money.  I really like the different features to choose from.  Other customers have mentioned their pictures were washed out.  I did not encounter that problem unless I chose the wrong setting to shoot the picture.  I found that indoor pictures taken on the automatic setting look yellowed (depending on the lighting), however if the shot is taken on the indoor setting the pictures come out fine.I also love the action shot setting.  I took some great photos of my husband and son jumping through a wave in the Atlantic Ocean.  You can see the individual water droplets around them!  I like that the pictures come out clear and are not pixilated, even when taken from a distance and zoomed in.The video option is nice if you don't want to lug around a lot of equipment.  I was amazed at how many video snipets we took while vacationing and we still had a lot of memory left over.  You can also choose to capture sound with each photo taken.  For someone who wants to remember names, dates, or specific places this can be a great feature.  We have captured our son saying some of the funniest things after the shot was taken!We purchased this camera to take on a cruise to document my parents' 50th wedding anniversary.  I would trust this product for any of your precious memories.A note of caution, if you do not pick up the memory card M+, you will find that the camera speed is slow.  I talked with a sales manager at Circuit City and he said it was the memory card that slows down the camera reset time, not the camera itself.  So if you want it to be ready to take another picture fast, spend the extra money and get the better card.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great compact digital camera", "Author": "J.

Ramos", "ReviewID": "R37947H9YAE20L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 26 years of being in the hobby of photography, I have already outgrown the stage where I thought that the best cameras were simply the ones with the most number of bells and whistles. There was a time when I wouldn't even consider something inexpensive, thinking that surely it's features weren't the latest. Maturity has given me the wisdom of realizing that as far as my point and shoots were concerned (and I've had so many of these through the years), I have never really availed of much of these whatchamacallit features! The point of having a point and shoot, after all, is to be able to just point and shoot (and leave all the adjustings with your SLRs)!  A few days ago, I ordered the affordable (inexpensive, not cheap) Olympus FE-340 and FE-290. Yes, I ordered both of them! I was attracted by the 5x optical zoom of the FE-340 and the 4x (with wide-angle) optical zoom of the FE-290, and I couldn't decide which one I wanted more. Well, it turns out that the combined price of both units were still less than the price of one comparable unit of another brand. More importantly, I simply trust the lens of the Olympus since I know that it is a long-time optical company that created an optical product, not just an electronics company that decided to dabble in cameras.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "E.

I was hoping this model would become my new primary photo machine.  The price was right, I was attracted by the nifty BLUE color: But dissappointment set in after I took it out of the box.  The two features that caused me to return the camera are:#1) the telephoto control is awkward, a pin head sized ball on the front of the camera.  I don't know why Olympus decided to get away from the eminently sensible toggle switch on the back which the right thumb could toggle while holding the camera steady with two hands.#2) was the killer though. Whenever the camera was turned off, when you turn it back on it resets itself to the AUTO setting.  It didn't hold my setting of FLASH OFF.  That resulted in an embarrassing moment in a very solemn situation where expressly there was NO FLASH ALLOWED.At that moment, I knew the camera was going back to the store.I want a camera that holds MY settings, not reverts to the default.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "Angie D.", "ReviewID": "R1ASF33BKSCT8K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't understand the good reviews for this camera.  My problem is the one described by others:  photos look great on LCD, terrible once uploaded to the computer.  My son's fourth birthday party photos were a disaster: the colors were blown out, kids blurry and the zoom created weird, shiny eyes on the children.  The only photos that were even okay were close-ups when the children were posing and not moving at all.  We tried every setting and none worked to take decent action shots.  What a disappointment, as the features *seem* like they would make a very cool camera indeed.

I put a 1Gb Olympus XD in and the Panorama option works.  So, it looks like the camera has a firmware problem recognizing the newer 2Gb Olympus XD cards.Olympus will only allow Panorama pictures with \"their\" brand XD cards. So, I was extremely disappointed when I discovered this problem.So, I only gave this a 3-star rating since with 8Mp pictures you really do want to use as large of memory cards as possible... For all types of pictures.**** Found out the New Olympus Brand XD card was the problem with not being able to do panorama.  I used an eraser to clean the contacts.  Then it started working.so, now... if I could figure out how to up my rating... I'd up it to 4stars.I didn't like how the camera performed taking pictures in the school gym at my daughter's concert.  I never did quite get the correct settings for a decent (non blurry) picture.  If I had figured out how to turn off the auto-focus, it probably would have done better.Now that I've been using the camera a few weeks.

The display screen it just the right size (some are too small) and is very clear when viewing your shots.  One of the features on the camera is for taking pictures thru glass.  I lined my camera up between the slates of the blinds so they weren't visible and took numerous shots of my sister's dog sunning on the deck.  You absolutely cannot tell it's taken through glass.  I am actually buying the same camera in pink for my sister for her birthday because she had so much fun with mine.  I would definitely recommend getting the 2GB picture card for the camera to increase the memory.  For approximately $20, it's well worth it.

The camera has good high-iso performance, at least better than average, but there is a lot of smudgy noise reduction.To make things worse, the camera only uses xD cards, which are expensive, and even the faster models are not as fast as cheap sd cards.

The camera cost us $175 new! They wanted to charge us over half of the cost of a new camera to fix it when they should have honored their warranty anyway!
