I'm writing this review because I'm beginning to appreciate the reviews from other customers when I buy things.  I was in the market for a new digital camera because the one I had accidentally went for a swim.  I had a 3 MP kodak easyshare from 2002.  I was generally satisfied, it took decent pictures, definitely easy to use.  So, this time I thought I'd stick with kodak, just upgrade the MP and get a smaller camera.  I bought the V603.  To be fair, it's small, probably too small trying to work the buttons.  Outside the pictures are pretty good, inside, two words, horrible, and useless.  I called kodak, they walked me through changing around the settings as I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, nope, still bad.  It was unacceptable to me so I returned the camera, paid the restocking fee.Anyway, after reviewing a bunch of different brands, sizes, etc, I purchased this one.  Very, very satisfied.  Particularly with the picture quality (after all that's the whole purpose of a camera anyway, right?)  Better then expected.  So far, pretty straight forward to use, I'll confess i've only kept it on automatic settings.  I put my daughter on the swing, I was facing the sun and took some pictures to put it to the test.  Awesome, they looked like perfect still pictures.  My wife couldn't believe she was moving in the picture.So, it's not a pocket/compact camera, or whatever you call it, although it's still fairly small.  At this point, I wouldn't want to get a smaller camera and compromise the picture quality.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Value !  Many Features !

It was that easy.  Then I started looking at the many, many features this camera has.  I was blown away.  The first time user can use it just by turning it on and pointing and shooting.  The experienced user can set shutter speeds, f-stops, do panoramic pictures, and many, many more things.  The battery life is amazing.  I have used other digital cameras, but this is the best I've ever seen or used.  The fact that it has 6 MP is just awesome.  When I plugged the camera into my 32 inch TV, I saw no pixels at all.  The 6x optical zoom is also wonderful.  I attended a community event with lots of children, and I was able to zoom in on children clear across the park and still get good close-up photos.

It is very user friendly and easy to understand. The quality of pictures that this thing produces are just great. I will admit the the flash recycle time may take 2-3 seconds but its really nothing to get worked up about unless you take alot of pictures at night or really dark places. Me, I just snap pictures of my 2 year old son outdoors in the day and in the house under regular and dim lighting conditions and the pictures are always about 90% acceptable.

I got it to use when I don't want to (or can't) use my big camera (a 20D), and I have enjoyed almost every aspect of it.  I say \"almost\" because I can't recommend it, despite its great pictures, its ease of use, and its excellent controls.Early Canon point-and-shoots had well-known problems with grit in the zoom lens, and this camera seems to revert to type.  Maybe that's because Canon hasn't worked all the bugs out of the six-times optical zoom.  Whatever the cause, the zoom lens started sticking about a week after I bought it, and I discovered that the lens seals had let some grit into the system.  I sent the camera in for repair, only to learn that this flaw is not covered by warranty.  I paid the rather large repair bill (and got very fast service).  But I would not use this camera anywhere that the problem might recur.  Canon needs to fix the seals, not disclaim responsibility.Aside from this, I especially like the easy-to-use exposure compensation button, the flexible menus, and the fact that I can switch ISO so readily.  Other than the lens seals, the camera is a gem.  But those bad seals are a killer.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great first impression", "Author": "Julian Richardson", "ReviewID": "R6EK1OG32XCA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this camera today and I am excited. My first impression is that this is a very nice camera. The screen is big and bright, and the camera in general is fast (the flash may be slow as others say). The camera senses which way round it is when you take a shot, and rotates the image accordingly, which is cool. The camera is jacket pocketable rather than trouser pocketable, but smaller than I had feared and will suit me. AA batteries and SD card are both nice features for me - it took me about a minute from first opening the camera box, to getting that first shot (and that included 30 seconds to find the SD card from my old broken Casio).I chose this camera after 4-6 hours of research taking in the main camera websites, and a quick peek at the related A620 (which I think it bigger than the A700). It was a toss up between the Canon A700, and the Canon SD700.On the one hand, the SD700 is superdinky and megacute, and has image stabilization. On the other hand, the A700 is significantly cheaper, available now, and has 6x instead of 4x zoom. To be honest, I'm not sure when the image stabilization on our other camera (a Konica Minolta) is on, so I guess image stabilization isn't so important to me.", "Date": "April 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with Great Options!", "Author": "K. MCKINLEY", "ReviewID": "R2IAHJ72VYJLAN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera with many options for users who want to upgrade an existing digital or replace an aging SLR (and keep features they love in the SLR).  The screen is large and resolution is great.  Photo outputs are fantastic, with very little noise (much better than the Sony this replaced).  This assessment is made on a comparison of two identical images at the same resolution between the two cameras and images sent to Ofoto for processing.  The price is fantastic for the options.  Changing resolution settings between shots is quite easy, once you get used to the interface.The only negative I found is the transfer of the image to a PC.  I think it could be smoother.  I prefer to use Windows Explorer for managing file locations.  While that may be possible with this camera, I just have not spent the time to resolve the difficulties I've had with that.  None the less, the transfers are quick.I would highly recommend this camera and could not be any happier.", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon has another winner!", "Author": "David S.

I have other VERY fine Nikon Digital SLR's but they weigh a TON. I travel a lot and want to take great pictures, this little gem fits the bill. As far as I can tell so far (I have had the camera just over a month) the only draw back is that it does not come with a rechargeable battery pack. (You can use rechargeable AA's) But given the other features, I will live with it!

They still somehow do have the look of a cheaper digital camera.  I'm not sure what exactly it is, slightly higher JPG compression, or just more noise.  But I can immerdiately tell the difference between Rebel XT pictures and A700 pictures.  I'm being a little picky though, overall the results are really good.My major complaint is the flash recycle time.  It's really horrific.  About 5 seconds for me with rechargeable NiMH batteries.  That's a long time if you want to catch a specific shot...  It's a good thing I don't do much flash photography.Yes, the noise does get pretty bad at 800, but it's still better than not having a picture at all.  You can reduce the noise somewhat later with software.This camera does clip highlights pretty bad.  I find that annoying at times.  Areas of light within a darker shot are completely washed out.  This really shouldn't be the case in this generation camera.I'm not sure what the people with the E18 error are talking about, this camera has not been on the market for a year, heck, barely 6 months...I always use custom functions and usually shoot in Av mode with the highest quality and 80 or 100 ISO to get the best results possible.  I love how this camera is nearly as flexible with options as an SLR.To summarize, this is a very good camera.  I would buy it again (unless something newer and better was available).  If this camera had a shorter flash recycle time and didn't clip highlights as much as it does, I would have given it 5 stars.4 Months Later:I have used this camera quite a bit and it has travelled with me to a lot of places.  Unfortunately the automatic lens shade got stuck and would not work anymore.  I sent the camera to Canon and it was repaired under warranty and returned to me within a week.  Great customer service.  If I would do it all over again right now, I would probably get the Canon A700 IS or the A 640 which will all be released this October (2006).", "Date": "July 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "The most professional camera for its price", "Author": "Angelo", "ReviewID": "RIYZTTDQSCXKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is unique on its kind.It has awesome features.

Bernstein \"giant rider\"", "ReviewID": "R2IU59VZVA4LS5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've blown 1000 + shots through the A 700 since buying in Jun.  I've used from my home in Long Beach, CA to Cranbrook, British Columbia and back.I was looking for a camera with a lense greater than 3X, but not as great as 10X, as the camera had to fit easily in a ziplock sandwich bag, and into a cycling riding jersey.  In short, a camera I could carry conveniently, and also keep it dry and handy.The A700, I found was perfect.  I could dismount from my bike, reach into my jersey pocket, pull out the sandwich bag with the camera dry inside.  It took seconds.Doing slide shows in our campsite showed scenes of Canada that were breathtaking.  On an iBook screen, the colors popped out (Even more so on a 20 in screen).I used the camera to take scenic shots, and close-up, i.e. macro shots of plants (in one case, bear scats).  It seemed to deal with that range well.  I worked around the long flash cycle time by shutting the flash off and working in available light.  The results I thought were excellent.However, the flash cycle time did seem long.  A missing fill flash feature was especially disappointing.  Also missing was a bracketing feature which was available on my older, 3x Minolta.  As a result of the above factors, I've downgraded this camera to 4 stars.Everything considered,  this is a camera I'm glad I bought.  Hopefully there isn't the dread, \"E 18 error\" message in this camera's future.", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not Canon's Best Effort", "Author": "J.

The photo quality was actually pretty good but like other's who have reviewed this camera, I also found the lag time between pictures to be a problem and for me the noise level starting at ISO 400 and above was not acceptable. I ended up returning this camera and getting Canon's new Powershot S3 IS which I can definitely recommend. I think most beginners would be more forgiving with the A700 but for the more discerning photographer, I would recommend looking at other models.", "Date": "May 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "A disappointment; has some +'s, but doesn't take great pics, and doesn't hold up either.", "Author": "Alexander C. Zorach \"Alex Zorach\"", "ReviewID": "R1OOFCSG5S54JD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The 6x digital zoom is nice, and the zoom is fast and easy to use with precision.  The camera has a very quick startup speed, which makes it easy to capture things like birds which won't sit still for you.  The menu and user-interface are very easy to use, and it is very easy to view pictures.  The screen is huge and very clear.This camera loses, though, when it comes to the quality of photos.  It takes decent photos outdoors in bright sunlight, but under any other conditions the photos are unacceptably noisy for a camera in this price range.  My old Olympus that was only 4.0 megapixels actually took much better flash photos indoors.  The ISO-800 setting is almost worthless because of the noise, and the 400 setting is still noisier than my old Olympus.  The flash-cycling is very slow, making it impossible to shoot flash photos in quick succession.My biggest complaint about this though is that after less than 6 months of moderate use, the covering mechanism for the lens broke; it would not shut properly when the camera was turned off.  Although it was still under warranty, I was frustrated by having to return a product for service so soon.  For a $300 camera, there is no excuse for having such a basic mechanical failure.Bottom line, this is not a $300 camera, it is a $100 camera with a lot more zoom, and a $300 price tag.  Canon is trying to make a fast buck with a poorly designed product.  Do yourself a favor and don't make the same mistake I did by buying this.

Grim", "ReviewID": "RKK3I4EQ8B89", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, I really like my A700. I took the camera on a trip to Italy and was extremely pleased with the performance, shooting 95% on automatic. After spending considerable time researching available cameras, it replaced my Powershot S40, as I wanted to upgrade to the 6MP and the 6x zoom. I'm used to the Canon settings (having had the S40 and a Rebel), so that was a consideration. Yesterday I took some head and action shots at the Eagles game (sideline pre-game warmup)and was impressed by the ability to stop action using the Tv setting.I do agree with some of the issues pointed out by reviewers, namely:1. I had to return it after two weeks, as the automatic lens cover started sticking. Servicing was quick, but it seems to be an issue with this model. I'm hoping it isn't a reoccuring problem.2. Flash recycling time IS slow. Mine runs about 6-8 seconds. Luckily, it's a minor annoyance with my shooting.3. For all the great features they built-in, a hot shoe for an attached flash would have been a nice addition.4. I wish they had added a remote shutter release...oh well.5. True, the 800ISO setting is extremely grainy, but you quickly learn not to use it unless you expect and can accept the results (and a tripod isn't permitted). And, easy to pretend it's not there.Overall, I found these to be minor items when balanced with the near-perfect blend of features.Lastly, one of the features I thought I'd use was the ability to add telephoto and wide-angle lenses, as well as filters.

The size is good and fits in a pocket and the features are great. In the end the 6x zoom and 2.5\" LCD won me over compared to other models that had only 3x or 4x and 2\" LCD. After pictures at a wedding and a trip to Australia, I can say that this camera takes amazing quality photos. My girlfriend has the Canon sd400 and we both took pictures on our trip. The a700 zoom allowed me to take better photos in many instances than the 3x on the sd400 and the pictures were still clear at full zoom. Canon picture quality overall is outstanding and I was cautious to buy a digital camera because of the slightly fake looking images i've seen with some digital cameras compared to a good quality regular camera. However, I could not be happier with the quality of images with the a700. The battery life is good and last about 300+ shots and I was able to get an extra 20 pictures after the camera had shut off and told me to change the batteries. The video quality is decent and the sound quality is good. 8x10 prints that I had made looked fantastic and I ordered larger images because the 8x10's turned out so clear. Everything is easy with this camera. Almost all the pictures I took were on the Auto Setting except when I used the Color Accent feature which can make some cool photos. Almost no blurry images, out of 500 pictures I had 4 or 5 that were slightly blurry. Overall a great camera and a spectacular value for under $300.

The A620 is slightly larger than the A700, has a smaller viewing screen, and has less zoom. Other than that it's a better camera. I don't mind the slightly larger size and smaller screen- the only thing I miss is the longer zoom.

I have a warraty with a separate company but the value of that is only known when it breaks.  The basic advantage of the camera is it has a variety of settings when auto settings simply do not work. And, most important, is it has a viewfinder. Taking pictures of moving objects is silly with a screen only. And when the sun is behind you forget about it. The screen is fine under good conditions. But I do recognize that people do not have my needs.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Thomas M.

Gu \"Moonlight Crystals\"", "ReviewID": "R1OML3MPBYNHZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I'd like to say wow, I bought this camera over 3 years ago for around $400 and it's still selling at around the same price today on Amazon. Having said that, I'm not sure if a lot of people are still buying this camera or are buying newer models (most of the reviews are from 2006 so I'm guessing there are better newer models around now) I still love my camera, it still takes great sharp pictures and it doesn't really feel outdated. It's got a pretty high optical zoom of 6x for a digital camera of this size, which is great. the 6MP resolution may seem a bit on the low side nowadays but unless you want to print gigantic posters, it is perfectly fine. The camera itself is a bit bulkier than most small digital cameras and it's not something that you can fit easily in your pockets. I think it's because of the high optical zoom, but I like it because it's more stable when I hold it (I have trouble holding really small cameras like the ones from Sony/Nikon steady enough and the images become blurry as a result) and that allows sharper images to be produced. The battery life is okay, it's not exceptional, I've been using Lithium batteries, that seems to last longer, but it's more expensive, I've recently switched to using rechargeable Ni-Cadmium batteries, Alkaline batteries never worked for me. Anyway, overall, I think it's a great camera for everyone, although you probably want to buy a newer model!

As a photography hobbyist I had a Canon A590 that I really liked but wanting to get into the use of scripts to do special things like automated timed shots for time lapes photography and bird photography I discovered that the A590 was not on the list for cameras that could run the scripts I wanted to use.  So, I searched the list and found that the A700 was.  It is also a popular camera for kite aerial photography which I also do.  After receiving the A700 I found a simple to use, robust camera that does exactly what I want it to do.  It has a nice large display and simple menu and other controls.  I have been a long time fan of Canon point and shoot cameras due to their general toughness and ruggedness.  I am perfectly happy with the A700 even though the A590 offered slightly higher resolution.  It takes very nice shots and with my use of CHDK scripting can shoot in the RAW format.

All other cameras have 4x or less.(2) Lots of different settings so it's good for beginners that don't know how to use a camera and just want to point and shoot all the way up to more advanced users.(3) Excellent video camera abilities. Can take lots of footage with nice, loud sound.(4) Nice big viewing screen.(5) Viewing window in addition to viewing screen. Great for sunny days.(6) AA batteries used means you don't have to run out of power in the middle of the trip like you would with a built in battery.(7) There is automatic lens protection when you turn the camera off. No losing caps, forgetting to cap it, or having the lens cap fall off.Cons:(1) Flash recycle time is impossibly slow. I've missed out on so many pictures because the camera won't take any pictures for a period of time after you used the flash, even if you turn the flash off.(2) There can be LOTS of noise on the picture, especially if it's dark.(3) For some reason night pictures look great on the screen right up to when you push the button to take the picture...the picture suddenly gets dark like if you were using a disposable camera. For some reason, the camera does not have this issue if you record a video of the scene.

It's in excellent condition, but I wanted to upgrade to the larger A700 screen since I hardly ever used the swing screen.I've resold other items on Amazon and saw there were used models of the A95 and assumed and for that reason only (there are cheaper sources) bought it from Amazon.However, never assume! Turns out Amazon has a closed market for certain items, allowing only certain resellers for some cameras, including the Canon PowerShot A95. Therefore, I am returning the A700, stuck with the shipping costs that are not refundable.From the little I've used it, it's a definite upgrade over the A95 and shortly after getting it a couple of days ago I compared the two. For the quality of the camera itself, I'd give it 4.5 stars (because of the slow flash recycling - otherwise, a 5.) But because of the deceptive listing, indicating one can resell your other camera, I'll give it only an attention-getting 3.So, buyers beware: don't trust the \"Sell Yours Here\" --- some you can (you can resell your A700, for instance!); some you can't (the A95, for instance.)
