It was great to use at the water park and theme parks.  I didn't need to take my high end camera with us.  The camera is durable and takes really good pics. I read a previous review that said they kept getting water in it.  You do have to make sure the latch is all the way closed and it sometimes takes some doing but we had absolutely no problem with water getting inside.  We played with the cameras settings in our backyard pool before we went on vacation so we would have quality pics.If you are thinking of purchasing a waterproof camera this is the one to buy, affordable and great pics!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Coleman Xtreme C5WP Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Blue) + <2> Transcend 8GB microSDHC Card +\n<3> Spare NP-20 Battery + <4> Floating Camera Strap (Orange) + <5> Zeikos 50-Inch Compact Tripod +\n<6> PD-C10 Camera/Camcorder Case + <7> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <8> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<9> PD Flexible Table Mini Tripod + <10> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <11> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Coleman Xtreme C5WP Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Blue) with 8GB Card + Battery + Floating Strap + (2) Cases + Tripod + Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S8TLSYLML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004WSLZ6O"}}
