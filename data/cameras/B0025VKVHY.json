It took relatively amazing pictures for the money, has a great bright screen, and did a good job with macro (closeup) photos, where I used it most often.I have only two complaints:1) the power button is easy to hit, like in your pocket.  Then the lens wants to pop out.  If it's in a confined space, it breaks.2) the door for the SD card is a little dodgy; I ended up putting tape over it to keep it from flopping open sometimes.But really, for <$60, it's quite amazing.", "Date": "November 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Amatuer Camera", "Author": "Sci-Fi Fan", "ReviewID": "R285JAMH01FWW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[My Teenage daughter's review of this product]I bought this camera almost exactly three years ago. It was my very first digital camera, and was perfect! We got it for about $100ish.The pictures are VERY high quality, same with the videos. I never really found anything super great in the different settings, but there were a few I loved!This camera came with me everywhere, camps, vacations, pools, field trips, everywhere! It went through extreme heat and extreme cold. It's gotten water on it. It's been banged into walls and dropped more times than I can count.  I really can't think of anything to complain about with this camera. It was perfect for my first digital, and it's inspired my love of photography. VERY easy to use!It finally broken after 3 years of faithful service, the system just finally broke down, I think. But I have DEFINITELY gotten my money's worth out of the thousands of high-quality pictures I've taken.So yes, I definitely recommend this for children/teenagers/someone who just wants an easy-to-use good quality camera.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "Gina MB", "ReviewID": "R3458M3OM7L8OB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes, the camera is a good price, and it even takes pretty high-quality pictures.  However, it has broken twice in less than a year.  I was able to get a replacement camera one time, but that's all the company will guarantee.  It experienced the same problem of not turning on (even with fresh batteries) twice.  It just completely shuts down.  Better off spending a bit more on a higher-quality camera.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0025VKVHY"}}
