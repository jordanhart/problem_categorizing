{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HS20EXR First Look", "Author": "beas62", "ReviewID": "R34QPX97WDOG4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had spent my first day with the HS20EXR and was generally very pleased with the functionality and performance.  Make no mistake, this is not a DSLR, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  This camera packs some capabilities and features that I would dream to have in one of my DSLRs.  Although it's not a large camera, for those who've used the HS10, you'll already know that the build feels solid and the handling is somewhat like a smaller DSLR.  The menu system is fairly easy to navigate and more common functions, like exposure, focus, and flash modes are easily accessible via dedicated controls.  Be prepared to spend an hour or so getting familiar with the controls and menus - it may be intimidating if you're brand new to this type camera, but most experienced photographers will pick it up quickly.A couple of early concerns materialized.  First, I experience the temperature warning display that has been noted in some early reviews.  However, I didn't see any degradation in performance even with the warning lit.  Upon calling Fujifilm, they quickly sent a replacement and I'm happy to say the problem didn't reoccur to that extent, but later I experienced temp warnings in warmer and more continuous use conditions.  Another minor irritant while shooting was that the display froze for a moment while focus was obtained.  If shooting a moving object, this could mean the difference in getting or not getting the shot.  After some further testing, I discovered that this problem seemed related to the \"Multi\" focus mode.  I did not experience the same degree of delay in Center, Area, or Tracking modes.The flexibility in shooting is remarkable, given the standard PSAM controls, plus some really interesting advanced features, there's few still shooting situations the camera will not handle.  Those extras I found very appealing are the EXR High-ISO/Low Noise (SN mode), the Pro Low-Light modes.  In SN priority mode, I was able to shoot at higher sensitivities up to ISO 1600 with very low noise and even ISO 3200 was very usable.  I'm sure I'll get flack for this, but I have to admit some shooting modes outperformed my D300.  I believe this has more to do with the HS20's high ISO performance than general lens clarity or image detail, in which most DSLRs excel. The Pro Low-Light mode is another trick-up-the-sleeve that combines 4 exposures taken in rapid succession into one very low noise image even in very dim light.Not surprisingly, the HS20 autofocus did seek a little in low light, but not much more than my DSLRs in the same setting.  The zoom lens was impressive for such a small package and both wide and full zoom shots were crisp.  There are many more modes and options, but none of these bells and whistles would mean much if the end results didn't deliver.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness of the full sized 16MP images - I really expected to see a lot of artifacts from noise reduction and other in-camera processing.  On the contrary, my \"pixel peeping\" revealed clean edges and very good fine detail.  Pictures of my cat actually show individual fine hairs instead of the painterly effect of some compact cameras.  It seems like Fuji took lessons from predecessors and managed to squeeze more image quality out of their tiny sensor than many of us expected.One of the cool benefits of the CMOS sensor is speed.  Once I figured out the continuous shooting modes, I was tickled at being able to fire off 8 fps in full resolution.  I also played with the 11 fps mode which works with at 8MP and felt like I was shooting an old movie camera instead of a point and shoot digital.One issue of concern to me was the processing speed or write speed of the files to the card.  This was a common complaint for the HS10.  What I found was that the write speed is improved, but don't expect DSLR performance.  A JPEG Fine image would write to card in under 1 second to my SanDisk Extreme Pro, and a RAW file averaged 4 seconds.  Now before you say \"WHAT?\", let me explain that that is the write time itself, HOWEVER, due to the internal cache, the camera is ready for the next shot in less time than the write time.  I found that generally it was ready almost instantly shooting JPEG and with RAW, there might be a second or two delay for an individual image.  In burst mode, the camera was able to cache all images in the burst without pausing, although after capturing the images, the write time again took 4-6 seconds depending on the image sizes.  So not a perfect situation, but definitely an improvement over the noted problems of the HS10.The video was very easy to use and looks acceptable for simple scenes at wide to normal viewing angles.  At full zoom, images were shaky and focus was slow.  Plan on using a tripod for long zooms, and careful zooms and panning.  With the manual zoom barrel, which is really geared toward still photography, zooms can be awkward during video recording, without the smoothness of the typical motorized zoom.  The video issues were not a big deal to me since the features that attracted me to the camera were for still images.One area that is still a minor irritant is the electronic viewfinder.  It is still pretty low resolution and is difficult see small details in your scene.  Given a bright outdoor scene, it does allow composition without fighting the glare on the LCD, but it seems like they could have could have packed a little more resolution in there to make it more useable.  That problem is offset somewhat by the articulating LCD screen.  It allows you to view from odd angles and with a little extra manipulation you can usually get a clear image even outdoors.Another minor nit pick is the inclusion of alkaline batteries with the kit.  Not only do alkalines not last very long with this camera, they actually heat up during use possibly contributing to some of the temperature issues.  I quickly replaced them with NiMH Eneloops and surprisingly, the camera's operation actually sped up noticably.  If you buy this camera, invest in some good rechargeable NiMH batteries - you'll be much happier.The software accompanying the camera is not impressive, but it does what it needs to.  It comes with picture management software Finepix Studio so you can view and organize your images.  It also includes a RAW file converter (Silkypix) which allows you to adjust and save captured RAW images as TIF or JPEG images.  Adobe Camera Raw didn't initially recognize the HS20's RAW format, but is now supported so if you are used to the Adobe workflow, you'll be happier with Adobe Camera Raw.On day one, I took a liking to this camera and gave it a starting rating of four stars.  As I got more familiar with the HS20, I've posted sample images and video and links to these can be found in the attached comments.  Although I've identified some issues that could be improved, this camera actually exceeds my expectations for a point and shoot.  I can capture images that rival an entry-level DSLR, and not have to carry around 20 pounds of equipment (camera body, wide and telephoto lenses, tripod, etc.).  The HS20EXR more than meets my desire for a relatively small travel or hiking camera that still has good reach and image quality.  If I could, I'd give a rating of about 4.6 stars.  I don't love everything about the camera, but as a whole, it's fun to use and a great photo-taking machine for the price.Pros: Shooting speed, low light performance, image quality, flexible shooting controls, massive sharp zoom rangeCons:  Slow autofocus/instability during video, low quality EVF, display lag on shutter releaseUPDATE - April 19th, 2011:  Firmware update to address the temp warning.  Everything else is working fine.UPDATE - April 29th, 2011:  Adobe Camera Raw now supports EXR RAW files.  Great news!", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awfully GOOD bridge camera!", "Author": "Robert Smaus", "ReviewID": "R3U4TLWM2V254Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for several weeks with all sorts of shooting involved.I have over 40 years experience as a photographer, both as an enthusiast and part-time professional.  I don't know-it-all nor do I pertend too, I'll just give my impression as honestly as I can.  I purchased it as an all-around shoot everything without having to pack a DSLR and lenses.For an amateur, I'd say it would be quite easy to learn to get many good shots.  For the intermediate user, it has a number of features that will help you produce outstanding shots.  For a more advanced photographer such as myself, all of the manual controls and abilities to \"replicate\" Fuji's film qualities are much appreciated.Overall, I find the quality of the construction to be among the best out there in terms of a \"less than DSLR\".  The photos I have shot are very good given the size of the sensor.  Color reproduction is outstanding, low light performance is just OK, speed is good, feature set is very, very good, and size/weight is moderate(a little bigger than most but I am comfortable with it).  If I want something smaller with me I'll stick with my Canon G12 and make do with a shorter zoom.Video is not a consideration for me really as I am usually packing a small Sony or my Canon XH A1s for that.  I have only tried my Canon 5D MKII once for video, great potential but it's  a still camera mainly.  I will not add to the video reviews given by others.My true surprise was the quality of the \"Super-Macro\" feature.  It can focus extremely close, even at up to 105mm equiv. setting, which provides a very diffuse background and dynamic subject.  These are some of the best results outside of my Nikon 200 Micro lens.The HS20 may not be the best at anything, but it is very good at many things and I am looking forward to a number of trips this summer.  For the really important stuff, the DSLRs will be used, but for just walking and hiking around rather unencumbered, I'm pretty sure this will work out just fine.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great superzoom camera, what the HS10 should have been", "Author": "DarthRad", "ReviewID": "R36P79TPE3HPLU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HS20 shares the same body and lens as the HS10, but has been beefed up with much faster and more capable electronics.  It is what the brain-dead HS10 should have been.  After all, it should be expected that one of the biggest uses for a superzoom camera would be shooting live action long distance shots and sporting events.  This sort of photography makes full use of the superzoom lens, but does need very fast focusing and fast shot to shot times.I had earlier purchased, reviewed, and returned the HS10.  The camera had terrific features, but was just too slow for anything more than predictable portrait shots.The HS20 focuses faster and processes and stores images faster than the HS10.  Not as fast as a full fledged DSLR, but close enough.  An example of a few runs I did on this camera:  At 16Meg Fine resolution, with RAW turned off, I could get off 16 shots in 20 seconds, manually clicking away.  With RAW and JPG both turned on, the speed dropped sharply to 5 shots in 20 seconds;  with only RAW turned on - 6 shots in 20 seconds.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, at 2Meg Normal resolution, with RAW turned off, I could get off 22 shots in 20 seconds.  With RAW and JPG both turned on, the speed dropped to 9 shots in 20 seconds.  The setting I'm most likely to use - 8Meg Fine resolution with no RAW - shoots at 20 shots in 20 seconds, one per second, which is pretty good.  Certain settings help improve the speed slightly - autofocus continuously, turn off the automatic picture review and red eye features, etc.The feature with the high speed series of shots has also improved from the HS10, with a maximum run of 32 shots from 3fps to 11fps.  This is much better than the HS10, which only allowed for a short run of 6 shots.  The maximum resolution of the images drops from 16M to 4M as you go from the smallest series of 4 shots at 3fps to the full 32 shots at 11fpsThe video also has improved.  Both the HS10 and the HS20 have 1920x1080 HD video, but the HS20 has a continuous focus mode that adjusts the focus as you track a subject, which the HS10 could not do (although the continuous focus during video on the HS20 is still a bit sluggish, I have to say).  The HS20 can do a 30 minute long 1080p HD video segment (I think the HS10 was only 15 minutes).  There is also an ultra high speed 320fps video at 320 x 112 resolution which runs for 30 seconds.A few quirks and gimmicks on this camera - there is a setting for \"silent mode\" in the menu.  This does indeed turn off all the beeps and artificial shutter clicks.  It also turns off the flash!  I set the camera to \"silent mode\" before testing the flash, which then did not fire.  For a moment, I thought I had gotten a bad camera with a broken flash.  To make this camera silent without turning off the flash, there are two other settings that should be used - volume settings that adjust the volume of the camera beep and the shutter click.Another setting gives you an electronic horizontal \"level\" in the lcd/viewfinder.The camera does give you a \"heat\" warning when you fire off a lot of shots very fast, e.g., fire off a couple rounds of 4M shots at 11 fps for a series of 32 will provoke this warning.  So far, though, the camera has kept going even with the heat warning on.The camera comes standard with a hard shell (not foldable) bayonet mount \"petal\" lens hood (unlike the HS10).  Yay!  What an intelligent idea!  This allows you to use a regular thickness 58mm lens filter/protector without causing vignetting at the ultra wide angle lens settings.The camera comes with a mini USB cable connector (unlike several of Fuji's other superzoom cameras, which came with a micro USB plug), and the image/video files transfer directly to your computer without needing any intervening software or SD card reader.  One of the most annoying things about the Nikon P100 (which I had also purchased and returned) was the fact that the image files would not transfer directly from the camera to my computer.  The HS20 also has an HDMI plug (no cable) and a video plug (with cable)Finally, the biggest reason that I have stayed with Fuji cameras - they still use AA batteries!  Now I know a lot of people are just the opposite and hate AA batteries and think they are heavy and obsolete.  I prefer heavy and obsolete to \"expensive, dead, and unavailable\", i.e., your camera stops working just when you need it, which is the truth behind all proprietary rechargeable lithium batteries.  In a pinch, AA batteries can be found virtually anywhere in the world, which is absolutely not true for proprietary lithium batteries.  As many other reviewers (including me) have mentioned, the key to success with AA batteries is to use only the Sanyo Eneloops, which are without doubt the best ever, far superior to any other rechargeable or alkaline battery.  In my first test run, I fired off over 1,000 shots on my HS20 (mix of file sizes) on a single charge of these AA eneloops.  Your mileage may vary.Compared to the Nikon P100, the HS20 is slightly faster in shot to shot times - not sure about the new P500.  I prefer the manual zoom and AA batteries of the HS20 though.The HS20 also has an external TTL flash mount, unlike the HS10.  Two Fuji flashes are supposed to be available soon, the EF-42 and EF-20.  The Fuji EF-42 looks like a re-branded Sunpak PZ42x with a proprietary Fuji hotshoe, priced a hundred dollars more.  Hopefully somebody will make a cheaper TTL synced flash for the HS20 soon.All in all, this camera is just too feature packed to go over all the details.  Having suffered through the HS10, I am familiar with the camera's basic strength, which is its powerful manually focused superzoom lens.  The improvements in electronics have finally made the HS20 what the HS10 should have been.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "HS20 First Impressions", "Author": "Gary Gildemeister", "ReviewID": "R1WO5H9CRBO6F6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After a couple weeks of use, I have \"reluctantly\" returned this camera.  I actually loved this camera and it was very painful returning it.  The photos were sharp, colors vibrant, and the camera was extremely easy to learn and operate.  Also, the camera has a robust set of features.  Prior to this camera, I owned a Panasonic FZ30K which has a manual zoom with 8MP.  The low light photos taken on the HS20 were far far superior to ones taken on the FZ30K. If I liked this camera so much then why did I return it?  Well, from my perpsective the only flaw with this camera is the video.  Initially, most complaints about this camera were about the \"heat sensor\" issue.  This has been resolved via firmware and using low discharge batteries per one person's suggestion found on the internet.  It appears that other people are starting to complain about the video quality too. The video quality color wise is fine and sharpeness too but only when in focus which isn't often.  When shooting video, the camera was constantly re-focusing. After researching this problem via the internet, a suggestion was made to set the \"Movie AF Mode\" to \"center\" rather than the default \"continuous\".  This certainly helped reduce the re-focusing but not eliminate it.  Inside a house, if I shoot a 25 second video from the middle of a room and panned the camera 180 degrees and everything is stationary, it will re-focus at least a half dozen times.  So, during playback you'll see the video go noticeably out of focus and then back in every few seconds which makes the video really unwatchable.  Then I tried doing the same in an outside setting whereby I'm maybe 50-75 feet away from what I was video shooting which did have stationary and moving objects.  In this situation, the video results were much better.  It would re-focus every once it in awhile.  During playback, you could see a very \"subtle\" and  brief re-focus.  In this case, the video was watchable.  On YouTube, someone video shot a cat on a window sill.  I looked at this one very carefully and I did not detect any re-focusing in the video.  I tried doing the same type of videoing myself and was never successful.  There is another video on YouTube of someone shooting a downtown scene.  This one too was excellent except when the person was zooming in and out.  When zooming in and out, I would expect the camera to re-focus unless done exceptionally slow. By the way, in my tests, I never zoomed in or out.  Plus, one test was in the middle of a room and I never panned the camera yet it re-focus several times.  There is another YouTube video where someone was shooting an Osprey eating its captured prey.  If you look at that video carefully and when there is no camera shake, you'll see some very brief and subtle re-focusing occurring.  If you are going to use the HS20 strictly as a camera or a camera plus video of landscape scenes then I would highly recommend this camera otherwise not.  I contacted Fuji via email about this video issue and their response was that they are investigating it and hope to have a fix soon.  Rather than having the camera and potential no fix, I decided to return it.  I plan to wait another 3-4 months to see if they issue a firmware update resolving this problem and if so then I'll buy the camera again.(Update 5/8/2011):I have done a little more research (via the internet) of the extra focusing problem when video shooting.  Someone suggested that you turn off the image stabilization feature.  There is an option off the \"menu\" button called Dual IS Mode which can be Mode1, Mode2, or OFF.  Since I have returned my purchase of this camera would some one be kind enough to conduct the following experiment or test and post your results as a comment against my review.  With the Movie AF Mode set to Center take a video of something inside your home until it does a few extra focus hunts  Then turn off image stabilization and perform the same video shooting and determine if the extra focusing is eliminated or reduced or the same as before  THANKS", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "CLOSE - BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH!!!", "Author": "G.M.", "ReviewID": "RILZOK2X866HC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The HS20EXR camera was tested side by side with Canon sx30 IS, Panasonic FZ40, Nikon P500, Fujifilm S2900-4000 series cameras, Kodak Z990, and Kodak c613 point and shoot.  A Nikon D90 and D3100 is mentioned as a result of casual use, but images were not tested.  The D90 and D3100 are referenced concerning ease of use of cameras. Compared to cameras in the Bridge/Super Zoom market, the HS20 camera is a 5 star product; I would rate this camera 5 stars if not for the manual focus that does not function, video that does not worked as advertised, and overheating issues not addressed until release of new v1.03 firmware after customers already suffered problems while waiting on updates. Additionally, while having the superior image quality in the bridge cam sector, image quality is still sub par for landscape/scenic photography.  Because of this the HS20 is a 3.5 star camera, but the rating system does not allow half stars so I listed 3. I also have had in my sole possession a Pentax K-R.  I will just sum up comments now; in comparison to the K-R, the K-R has much more clear resolution,even only having 12MP, and getting nice bokeh (intentional background blur) is better with the K-R, and the K-R menus are far more elaborate.  However, the HS20 is dead on accurate with exposure/white balance and gets you the shot you are looking for so much easier and more accurately.  I find I kept far more pictures (except for scenic shots-explained in detail below) from the HS20 than the K-R for the K-R has serious issues with exposure and color reproduction to the point it is absolutely frustrating - the HS20, you know you have your shot when you review in the LCD after the shot and feel good about it.  But that is just my experience.  Here is my review...PROS=====+++ color/contrast/exposure is by far the most accurate+++ low noise at ISO 200 or less - anything above 200 becomes noticeable as it does for any camera that uses the tiny little inferior sensor that ALL cameras use in this category.  Regardless, the lesser amount of noise in the pix from this camera beat out the competition.+++ overall image quality for near field subjects such as people, pets, architecture, hard defined objects, and some floral arrangements was superior+++ if managed properly, indoor flash shots were outstanding - colors were perfect and there were absolutely no washed out shots at all+++ menu layout and menu options were superior in design and functionality+++ manual zoom (once broken in after 20 hours of use or so) was superior in operation +++ faster to use, saves battery life, allows for extra area to hand hold and further stabilize+++ superior and fast image stabilization for still shots+++ outstanding white balance and white balance setup+++ fairly quick focus outdoors+++ moderately fast shot to shot times outdoors, lightning fast burst modes (though offset by write times)+++ superior LCD panel - 460K dot vs. 230K on Panasonic and Canon, Nikon and Kodak was 460 also.+++ best folding type LCD - fast and easy to use - it keeps you behind your camera and out of the sun - EVF is not even necessary - I took shots in bright sunlight and saw every last detail with this LCD - the best in this market+++ outstanding hot buttons to allow you to quickly change type of focus, ISO, exposure, etc. - far superior to competitors+++ AA batteries -HUGE PLUS - this enabled me to use Eneloop 1500x batteries - I got 900 outdoor shots on one set of 4 in one charge - mind blowing! The P500 only got 400 and the others around 500.  Plus this allows for cheap replacement and easy to find replacement batteries.+++ EXR HR PRIORITY mode - allows you to use all of your own custom settings, but the camera determines only shutter speed and aperture - ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT IDEA! - no one has this kind of setup.  This allows you to expect to get the settings you want, but the lighting conditions may change and the camera IQ will only adjust aperture and shutter to help with varied lighting.  To add to this, you can choose the exposure settings to \"zero out\" the variance the camera will use to get proper exposure.  This is hard to explain, but if you should use this camera, you will see what I mean.  It is very easy to use, yet very advanced.  Basically, choose what you like, choose the exposure in a given shot, and the variance now will be close to the same for every shot.  It is not perfect, but, once again, FAR superior to the competition.+++ Overall, an absolute incredible experience to use this camera - it just feels and operates that good - I was just overwhelmed!  I took over 4000 pix in 4 days and took 3000 test shots for 2 weeks before going on location.  I can tell you there is nothing quicker to navigate and more logically setup than this camera.  I have used the Nikon D90 and D3100 and can tell you they are total CLUNKS compared to this camera, though they likely have better image quality.  Shockingly, at much greater cost, those Nikons only allow use of the optical view finder to take shots, the LCD is for reviewing pix only!  I am just noting, this HS20 WILL SPOIL YOU.  The longer you use it, the more you see how logical the feel, navigation, operation, and use of this camera is.CONS=====- overheat warnings - despite firmware update and minding ambient temperatures- took scenic mountain pictures at 10x to 15x zoom - all evergreen trees looked like water color paintings.  No exaggerating - it was just AWFUL.  Tried multiple settings.- foliage and grass just looks horrible, even when in near field or as part of the subject - made me feel as though I needed glasses for it sometimes seemed I was seeing double- Sometimes will not find subjects in low light despite use of AF illuminator, but this is a common problem for most any camera sub $1000.- blur or unclear image detail when targeting in 'area focus mode' for subject as opposed to 'center focus mode' for subjects like a person, or a sign, etc.- video is limited to just using center focus and not zooming past 2x if you want good video - outside of this, it is awful.  However, I do not need video and would like to say the videos I made (outdoors only in order to get good lighting) were actually superior to anything else tested - again, as long as I did not really zoom and I used only 'center focus mode' instead of 'continuous focus mode' in the video settings.- horrible EVF - but it is not needed since the LCD is so darn awesome-horrible idea for a power switch - I accidentally bumped it off several times in middle of a shoot - perhaps my fault too, but it would be better to have a \"time release/spring switch\" instead of one that is off the moment it is barely moved.  Perhaps shortening the lever would fix this also.-camera is poorly sealed around the area of the battery compartment and SDHC door - the battery door is loose!  Otherwise, good construction/weight/feel-extremely slow write times - I used both an older CL4 Kingston 4GB SDHC and new Lexar 133 (CL20 type speeds), got the same sluggish write timesQUICK SUMMARY (IN CASE THE REST OF THE REVIEW IS TOO LENGTHY FOR YOU!)======================================================================-UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST BRIDGE CAMERA IN THE MARKET-MENU AND ESPECIALLY THE HOT BUTTONS ON LEFT OF LCD ARE EVEN SUPERIOR TO SOME DSLR'S MADE BY CANON, NIKON, AND PENTAX.  IT IS LIGHTNING FAST TO NAVIGATE THIS CAMERA, AND SOON, OTHERS WILL FOLLOW WHAT FUJI HAS DONE WITH THIS - QUITE A BRILLIANT SETUP-GOOD PICTURE QUALITY OVERALL, THOUGH IMAGES OF GRASS/TREES TEND TO BE A BIT SOFT OR DISTORTED ON OCCASION - NOTHING AS BAD AS THE COMPETITION THOUGH - SX30, FZ40, AND OTHERS ARE FAR FAR WORSE-SMOOTH, BUT NOT REAL FAST, SHUTTER TIMES AND OPERATION-IDEAL FOR ALL USES EXCEPT VAST SCENIC PHOTOGRAPHY-GOOD 30x SHOTS (I SHOT DEER, ELK, PHEASANTS, AND BUTTERFLIES FAIRLY EASY WITH GOOD CLARITY AT LONG DISTANCES)-GOOD INDOOR PHOTOGRAPHY - VERY LOW NOISE, TRUE COLOR AND NO HAZING-BEST COLOR, EXPOSURE, AND CONTRAST OF ANY CAMERA IN THIS MARKET-EXTREMELY LONG BATTERY LIFE USING DURACELL OR ENELOOP AA PRECHARGE 2000mah BATTERIES - FAR SUPERIOR TO OEM BATTERIES-SMARTEST MENU ON THE MARKET+++DO NOT COMPARE THIS CAMERA TO CAMERAS IN THE MICRO 4/3 SENSOR MARKET OR APS-C BASED CAMERA MARKET, DO COMPARE TO ANY OTHER 1/2.33 SENSOR CAMERAS TO BE FAIR.  HONESTLY, ANYTHING UNDER $450 WILL NOT COMPARE TO THIS CAMERA, BUT THOSE THAT ARE AT THE $500 AND UP WILL BE IN A DIFFERENT MARKET.  HOWEVER,No functional manual focus, too small a sensor for great photography (that instead yields just good pictures, not great - though poor for scenic photography), and overheat warnings really hinder this camera.If it came to just how smart the design of this camera was, its feel, its menu, its controls, its ease of use, its smart folding 460k dot LCD, its AA battery source and extremely long battery life, the EXR HD Priority Mode, and most of all, how fun it is to use, this camera is 6 stars on a 5 star scale.  Great stuff.HELP POINTING YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO SHOOT=================================================-Never shoot above 200 ISO with any bridge camera - there is no need with exception of rare occurrences to shoot 400 at sunset or if you are night shooting.  Just change shutter speeds instead and use a tripod.  I even got a crystal clear shot of the moon at ISO 200.-all my indoor shots and daytime/sunset shots were done at 100 or 200 ISO - this reduces noise in pictures-use fine and sharp settings in the menu-before using other EXR modes, use EXR->HR Priority.  This mode allows you to keep all your settings in the menu and all focus and exposure metering settings.  With EXR HR, the camera ONLY chooses shutter speed and aperture.  THIS IS AN AUTO FEATURE TO DIE FOR.  All other cameras completely take over your settings when in ANY type of auto mode, which ruins your ISO preference, color settings, sharpness, etc.  With EXR HR Priority, you are essentially still the \"boss\" of the camera, it is just aiding your lighting situation, which even then, you have an exposure hot key(yes, a hot key, no navigating thru a long menu) to tell the camera the variance you want to work within.-I read in a camera review website that using this camera in EXR HR mode and keeping the size options of menu at medium instead of large (no more than a 10MP setting) keeps down \"pixel smearing\" and other distortions, but I have not seen the difference-I have also read on several occasions the HS10 model has better picture quality for it does not try to cram so many pixels on one sensor (its max is 10MP)-REMEMBER, MORE MEGA PIXELS DOES NOT EQUAL BETTER QUALITY!!!  IN FACT, MORE MEGA PIXELS ON NEWER CAMERAS (IN OTHER WORDS GOING MORE THAN ABOUT 12MP) MEANS THEY ARE LYING TO YOU ABOUT IMAGE QUALITY IN ALMOST EVERY CASE.  DPreview, camerlabs.com, photographyblog.com, etc etc etc have observed in every camera that has gone over 12MP for the same model (example, the HS10 to the HS20 and the Canon T1i to the T2i then T3i) have degraded the picture quality by increasing Mega Pixel counts per the same sensor in each case.  Distortion occurs from overloading the sensor - BUT WHAT THE HECK, they got every one else to \"buy into it\" didn't they.  Its a bad thing.  BUT, do your research and you will see this is true. Go for image quality, not pixel counting.THE OVER ELABORATED PART OF THE REVIEW - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.......SPECIFIC THOUGHTS==================The feel of this camera, the incredibly smart layout and operation of buttons/controls (minus the power switch), the very intelligent menu, quick navigation, manual focus, and the rubber grip and weight and dimensions made this camera the most pleasurable experience I have had using a camera.  To top it off, the price effectiveness and long battery life with the AA battery options made this camera superior in reliability in shooting long outings.  The Nikon P500 has the worst battery - being the size of a thin chunk of cheese to put on a Ritz cracker, this battery did not even allow 400 shots outdoors.  Replacement batteries for competitors center around 40 bucks - my batteries for this HS20 (Sanyo Eneloop 1500x) cost just 10 bucks and lasted more than twice as long.  I just die when someone complains that this camera uses AA batteries - they really miss the point!  OEM batteries suck - period.  And if you do like them, don't count on finding them in 5 years!  AA batteries can only improve with time and they are already far better as long as you buy Eneloop 1500x or Duracell Precharged (white caps) that are only second to Eneloops and better than OEM.  Both these AA batteries are 2000mah, but superior to anything made - you can read detailed reviews on Amazon and other websites.The menu is great, streamlined, and keeps color and picture adjustments together in scrolling through the menu - very organized.  On top of this, the last place you were in the menu will be the first place you revisit when going back to the menu after choosing setup or camera options.  Although, after turning off the camera, you will be reset as to the last place you visited in the menu - no big deal since the menu is so organized anyway.  I found the menu to be far more accurate to use in that options actually made a difference in white balance, color, and sharpness of pix.  I did not have this luck with the FZ40 and the P500 does not even have manual color controls.  Even the Pentax K-R sharpness did not impact pictures as I would have hoped, but the HS20 did so you can artistically effect photos.  The P500 had far over saturated colors and the FZ40 had a terrible red hue to everything and was not able to be adjusted.  Shockingly, The Pentax K-R with the most superlative and elaborative White Balance menu still had problems with hue, yet this HS20 at half the cost was right on the mark with color and exposure.  The noise in the pictures by Canon, Panasonic, Kodak, and Nikon all are very notably inferior compared to the HS20, no exaggerating.  The K-R is in a different market, but must be noted the clarity of images it produced were mind blowing, but at twice the price, only 2/3 of the zoom, and the pain of changing lenses.Overall, I found everything about this camera superior to the competition and to previous point and shoots I have used.  However, 2 major issues caused me to return and NOT replace this camera.  1) heat warnings 2) extremely poor image quality for scenic mountain shots (which is actually a problem for ALL small sensor cameras and some entry level DSLR cameras - digital is difficult to use for wide/long range scenic shots).ELABORATING ON THE FLAWS========================I bought this camera for use as a camera that would capture scenic shots.  I was willing to put up with heat warnings that prevailed after anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes of VIDEO recording after also taking some pictures (keep in mind, I took pictures for an hour first - regardless, overheats should not happen).  As long as this HS20 would shoot scenic photography, I did not care anything of video.  Video for all cameras outside the video recorder market seem sub par to me anyway.Well, after I returned home from a 4 day shoot, I found that almost all TWO THOUSAND PICTURES LOOKED LIKE A WATER COLOR PAINTING, and I then immediately decided I could not keep this camera.I did some research and found that this can be a problem for small sensor cameras.  I am not an engineer or scientist, so it would be to your advantage to take my words with a grain of salt and do some research of your own - but, the problem goes something like this.  In the air there are photons traveling. These photons are like atoms (maybe smaller) that end up passing over the sensor giving info of color/contrast/brightness/detail of subjects.  The larger the sensor, the more all the detail will show up on that sensor.  Given the same amount of photons to scrunch onto a smaller sensor, the info is now divided so small the sensor can no longer distinguish details - the detailed info runs together and there is no distinguishing details.  Thus, in my pix, all you see of each 4mm sized tree on a 22\" monitor is a solid green outline, no variation in color, no branches, no tips.  Top it off, put together thousands of trees on a mountain side 1 mile away and all you see is a giant green blob.CAMERA SETTINGS===============I shot half my pix in EXR High Resolution (HR) priority, the other half were in Manual.  Most shots were between 40mm and 300mm full frame focal lengths (meaning about 2x to 12x zoom) so there is NO reason shots should look this bad.  I also tried varying Auto Exposure from Multi, Average, and Spot.  AF was mostly set to center focus, but I also tried Area Auto Focus.  I tried fluctuating higher f-stops with slower shutter speeds and lower f-stop with higher shutter speeds to no avail.  I kept all shots to ISO of 100 except when absolutely necessary, I then went to 200 ISO, but never higher.  It ended up that I kept menu settings at 'high sharpness, 'high noise reduction', image quality on 'fine', and used 12MP 16:9 shots.  Changing any of these settings did not matter for scenic shots - grass and trees were all mottled or water colorish in these shots that covered miles of terrain.I concluded this camera (and most likely all others with these tiny sensors) only have the ability to maintain detail if subject matter is within about 100 meters of the target focal point.  Everything outside that range does not just blur (which blurring is normal in areas outside the center of focus, in SOME instances) but instead, every last tree looks like a cartoon or water painting.  I was utterly shocked.I tested this camera at home prior to the mountain scenic trip and noted foliage was a bit mottled, but this is with all objects in the photo being in a 100 square meter area and not 10 miles apart.  So something is not quite right that at short distances, mottling was already showing.  Now, go out on a mountain side and things become exaggerated.  I felt like I just created water color paintings with my camera.  Obviously, anything outside that 100 square meter field will start losing clarity, but it should not lose clarity to the point it all runs together in a VERY one-dimensional appearance, not even 2-dimensional. Even the grass looked mottled from close distances. The grass looked very unclear - some areas detailed, some not, and detailed grass shooting out in the middle of blurry patches of grass.  The issue with grass being mottled is in all depths of field, not just distant scenery.FINAL DECISION - RECOMMENDED USE================================Since the overheats were prevalent after 1 hour of photography and 30 minutes of video, and the most important thing to me, scenic photography, was now unattainable, I very reluctantly returned the camera.If you are not using this camera on large terrain shooting across 20 miles of scenery and you do not need zoomed video, this camera is a MUST for you.  The pictures I got of cats, my wife, my flower beds (within 10 feet of focus), and pictures of architecture and still objects all came out really good.  Superior to anything else in this market.  The colors are AWESOME - not over saturated or pale.  Contrast is good, everything looked life like within the near field (within a 100 meter area of CENTER OF FOCUS - so this means you can zoom onto something 200 meters away and anything within 100 meters of that area will look okay - buildings, hard defined objects, and animals/people really show well zoomed at the full 720mm/30x focal length).  The camera feels good, operates good, and has great stabilization (beyond belief really - it blew me away how I could focus and stabilize at full zoom).  The LCD screen is awesome - ALL LCD panels should fold the way this one does and have the clarity this does.  This camera is a BLAST to use - fun like you will not believe and the manual zoom will grow on you fast.  Literally fast - I can zoom in less than half the time and with greater accuracy than others using the electric motor that bounces all over the place to get to the right spot. This camera blows the competition away.  Though only the HS20 was used in the mountains, I feel certain all sensors sized at 1/2.33 or 1/2 that are used in this market will likely have this problem.  If you do some research, you will find that these image sensors are just way too inferior/ too small for in depth situations.  Perhaps I am just looking for too much out of such a small sensor. As far as doing a competitive analysis in this bridge camera market only, I am telling you, this HS20 is to die for.  All the other cameras feel and function like toys compared to this.  A camera I have yet to test, however, is the new Sony HX-100V - then again, good luck finding one.  For some reason, very little stock of this camera was available in the entire USA at the time I bought this HS20.  I have read and seen reviews for the Sony and it lacks in image quality compared to the HS20 on professional reviews, but has superlative video to anything else in the bridge/superzoom market.OTHER NOTES============If I had  recommendations to Fuji, these would be it.1- give us a 300mm focal length instead of the not needed 720 in order to put in a larger sensor, put in an APS-C format, and rid of video if they have to in order to keep the price the same.  The larger sensor would then actually get clear pictures and the 300mm length zoom could be more effectively used to get realistic images.  IMAGE QUALITY TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER ALL OTHER FEATURES - super zoom and video comes later.  No picture quality, no camera.2- Fix the over heat - This is the 1AA serial numbered model camera with the latest v1.03 update installed and it still does not work.  I guess someone has to get the 1AB serial numbered model to avoid this heat warnings.SUMMARY=========I spent well over 300 hours the past 8 weeks on researching/testing/using cameras.  While I do not expect any of you to do this grueling research, I hope you do take the time to truly learn the basics of photography in order to understand better how ISO, Shutter speed, and Aperture (all 3 together are known as the exposure triangle) function within cameras and pictures so you can really get to know what camera works for you and more adequately write much needed reviews on Amazon.  Many or most of the reviews that are out there are just not helpful, unsubstantiated,  and lack detail.  What is more, it is evident many users NEVER GET OUT OF AUTO MODE, which tells me they probably do not know image quality nor take the time to compare image quality from camera to camera.  Hopefully, this review will help you.I can assure, PICTURE QUALITY TAKES PRECEDENCE over everything, smoothness of operation of the camera next, all other options are subjective or not so needed (like 720mm focal length lenses with a tiny useless sensor versus shorter focal lengths with a large sensor).  People need to talk more of ISO, aperture, and shutter speeds and test settings on cameras and explain the subject matter more clearly. People also need to learn about what really works before doing reviews! An example is the battery situation - People buy junk AA batteries on sale for 5 bucks from 5 years ago that are half dead and then complain the camera does not have good battery life and state they prefer OEM batteries as a result - phooey!  No OEM battery compares to Eneloop 1500x 2000mah batteries. I visited the Pentax website and noted a whole section of threads (conversation) filled up on the topic of how much better the AA batteries perform in the k-x/k-r cameras than the OEM battery.  Yet the OEM battery Pentax provides is better than most Nikon and good as Canon. NO MORE OEM BATTERIES UNLESS YOU WANT TO FIND YOURSELF IN THE SAME SITUATION THAT ALL OF US ARE WITH PRINTER INK!Going through this mess has taught me some interesting things about cameras and those variables which make photography work.  I hope I have helped you with what to expect from the HS20 by doing this review.  I guess I am headed to the DSLR market. I should ask all of you to wish the best for my wife - I am driving her nuts with reports on \"camera stuff\", as she calls it.  THEN AGAIN, I should ask you wish me well, for I am going to be one bruised and beaten husband when my wife sees the credit card bill after I buy a camera and some lenses!!!BEST WISHES TO ALL - AND HAPPY SHOOTING!", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm HS20 Digital Camera", "Author": "Michael T.

I have a Canon 7D and some L lenses, but that entire getup weighs more than some people I know. I wanted a camera with wide focal range and one that took excellent pictures. I had the previous Fujifilm HS10 and really liked it. Like most people reading these reviews, I had read about the serious problem encountered by some people with the overheating warning. Still, it didn't seem to be universal and I liked the specs so much that I decided to take the chance and ordered it. I have just returned from a week in Vegas, where temps hit in a range between the high 80's to 96 while we were there. I gave the camera one heck of a workout to see if any problems would surface. What did I get? Magnificent pictures. Never once did I get a heat warning. If it was ever going to do it, I would have supposed one day in the Red Rock Canyon, temps easily in mid-high 90's would have triggered this warning, but nothing happened. I am absolutely more than satisfied with the brilliant colors and sharpness of over 400 pictures I took during this period. I did not try the video, since I have no interest. I read this camera might be a little too heavy for some, come on! It is a feather weight compared to my other camera and lenses. Too complex? no way! Takes magnificent pics in the AUTO EXR mode, and you can fiddle with the dials to get everything in between. In summation: this camera was everything I thought it would be when I ordered it, even more so. I am not discounting that others ran into the heat warnings, but I did not. And I note that there is a firmware fix available should this warning present itself. I also echo others in saying that an initial investment in good AA rechargeable batteries is more than worth it. I use GREEN BATTERIES, but also have used ENLOOPs with the same result ... they keep a charge and can be counted on when you need that power most. I also agree that you absolutely should keep an extra fully charged set on hand at all times. This is just one person's experience with the Fujifilm HS20, and it has been a great experience. I should also add that, with the 2.8 focal capability, I took pictures in conditions that would have called for a flash with most cameras, and the pics were bright and clear ... something I paid big bucks for in lenses for the bigger Canon 7D. To me, this camera's a winner.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best in class", "Author": "Objective", "ReviewID": "R2ZEPGQTYWHL9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the HS20 for two weeks and shot about 400 images with it so far.  My previous cameras have been a Sony f707 5mp, 5x zoom camera from 2001 through 2006, and a Pentax K100D 6mp DSLR from 2005 through the present.I was considering purchase of a more current Pentax body (the K-X or K-R for $500 and $800) to utilize the 4 Pentax lenses I presently own.  The benefit over my existing K100D would have been a faster multi-shot rate, better low light/high ISO performance, and quicker focusing.  But two recent vacations where I had to switch lenses and miss shots, or ignore my wife while I was fully engaged in manipulating my DSLR, provided incentive to look around for a better \"carry around\" solution.I first started evaluating the super zoom bridge camera options last month.  I compared the HS20 with the Canon and Nikon counterparts.  Most reviews gave the HS20 an edge, mainly in photo quality.So, for less than the cost of a new DSLR body, I got the benefit of:* Higher multi-shot rate (up to 11 per second - at a reduced pixel count)* Greater focal length range than with my existing four Pentax lenses.* Much easier and great quality macro shooting built into the camera;  I would have had to buy a macro lens for my DSLR.* Very decent low light capability* Great panorama output processed/stitched \"in-camera.\"  I don't have to fiddle with post processing the images in my Elements program.  While Elements 9.0 does a very nice stitching job, it takes an extra 5 to 10 minutes to collect and process the 3 to 8 images I need to create the panorama.I agree that this is not a camera for those who just want to point and shoot, although it does that well.  This is a very feature rich piece of technology that would be wasted on the point and shooter.  As someone else has said, this is a \"near DSLR\" camera with a small sensor.Regarding the smaller than DSLR sensor:  There are trade-offs.  The image quality at large blown up sizes, e.g. greater than 100%, larger than 8 X 10, will not quite match a $500 DSLR.  But the smaller sensor does enable use of smaller optics that allows the extended focal range that on a DSLR would be absolutely grossly cumbersome.  I have been amazed at the good quality of night scenes, e.g. urban/suburban areas with low light.The many optional settings take some time to master to get optimum results.  Some of the complaints about focusing can be substantially improved with the right combination of focus settings.  The manual could use more examples on what combination of settings work best in different shooting situations.Color is outstanding, shooting options are rich, and image quality is considered the best for this class of camera.  On this basis, I give the HS20 5 stars.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a DSLR & not a Point&Shoot;", "Author": "MkScrooge \"MkScrooge\"", "ReviewID": "RZUEKOBL03D5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose to buy this after a lot of deliberation. I was originally thinking of either going for this, the Panasonic Lumix FZ100, Canon SX30IS or the Sony DSC HX100v.While the Panny was high on my list and Sony was yet to release theirs, I decided to settle for this for primarily 2 reasons... good manual high-zoom, and the EXR mode.Research and reviews of photographs showed the camera to be very capable. Unfortunately, after FZ50, Panasonic has discontinued their series of non-DSLR/prosumer cameras with a manual zoom. This might seem as a non-issue for many, but there is a joy (and sense of freedom) in being able to rapidly control the zoom manually versus electronically. The autofocus is reasonably good, though, a little slow as compared to some other high end cameras. I found that to be the case because the default is a single auto-focus instead of continuous (which is also a battery drain, as learnt from my Canon PowerShot S2IS).The EXR mode does capture pictures much better than most others that I've seen thanks to good HDR capabilities in the EXR mode. Control from the user is mostly taken away, but its still pretty good.The manual zoom control (plus the 30x Zoom) with a BSI CMOS chip was the clincher for the HS20. To my knowledge, Panny has not released/announced a successor to their FZ100 and FZ50. Sony, well, is/was still a while away in launching their HX100V.The EVF is pretty useless in my opinion, but the LCD is quite crisp & bright. Video, however, is a little disappointing, since the autofocus is kinda flaky. A bit of quivering in the image also appears during recording, which, I suspect, is because the Image Stabilization is performed on the sensor. This isn't, however, a big deal since the camera is good for taking still photos (like many DSLRs are not meant for video shooting really!).The burst rate, however, is good, and far superior to the Canon SX30IS, which lost out on this reason (apart from no manual zoom control).An articulating screen like the Canon SX30IS or the Panny Lumix FZ100 would have been nice, but this is fine. I wish the jog-dial of the Canon SX30IS was the mechanism of control as compared to the dial on the right top. It is a little inconvenient in my opinion. The SX30IS jog dial is very smooth, which means you can almost maintain the camera's focus on the subject while making changes to the setting.I've purchased some Hoya filters too, to go along with this, and I'm still trying it out. So far, I'm very impressed with the low-light high ISO sensitivity capabilities. While AA batteries aren't always the best power option, since they come cheap in bulk and readily available in most inhabited corners of the earth, I think it is a major factor that makes it stand out.Personally, I feel that if you are looking to take up photography as a hobby, without the excessive costs of a DSLR or the need to drag a bag of high zoom lenses, this is great. Even for a novice, this will take great pictures, which means you don't end up burning a hole in your pocket by purchasing a DSLR while having below-average pictures.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seems worth the price", "Author": "Skorp \"no_name\"", "ReviewID": "R3EHB1L5QKB1ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just tested this camera today, 15 April 2011.Color balance and resolution quality are fine.Here's my initial experiences: CONS first.Cons:Camera was packed in a plastic bag - lens cap was not installed. Lens was dusty - but no smears.LCD display did not have a protective film applied.Camera  did not accept a freshly formatted (but used) 4 GB class 6 SD card - it did accept a brand-new 16 GB Class 10 SD card.SilkyPix RAW converter software is not easy to use and the RAW pictures I loaded looked like garbage. After conversion to TIFF they were much better. The camera generated JPEGS were OK - could be better (see additional comment below).When taking a picture - your framed shot looks fantastic in the LCD viewfinder - however, as soon as you take the picture, the picture shown in the LCD looks much worse. I think this is just a poor down-conversion of the actual picture taken - but it is always a bit disconcerting to see the actual picture you took  become \"worse\" than the display was showing it. This could make one believe they had some camera shake or too slow a shutter speed. The actual picture viewed on a standard display appears OK.JPEG Engine saves at 1/8 TIFF size when set to \"fine\" (versus normal). That is a significant decrease in quality - maybe this will be fixed with firmware. There should be a \"Super Fine\" setting - that would save at about 12MB file size for 16M Pixel shots and 6MB for 8 M Pixel shots.. Until then; recommend you shoot RAW - use SilkyPix to convert to TIFF and then use your favorite JPEG builder to work those TIFFs (once SilkyPix converts the RAW to TIFF - the format can be read by any decent program - the original RAW pictures are Fuji proprietary format - yuk!).Pros: Well built, smooth operationColor balance was fine without even performing a white balance.The automatic EXR functions appear to actually perform as advertized. Under a couple critical shots - the camera decreased the resolution to 8 MP, however those half-resolution pictures were of a higher quality than a forced 16 MPZoom - outstanding! At wide-angle there is obvious pin-cushioning - but that is to be expected. This appears to return to a nice, square frame at the 35mm mark and above.I did not have any heat problems. Maybe should record a half-hour Full HD movie and see what happens.I gave the camera 4 stars in every individual description except image quality & battery power (5) but my overall impression of the camera is 5 stars.I think this is most likely the best bridge camera on the market right now (cameras with permanently mounted zoom lens).

There are major differences.  But it costs less than most good lenses for a DSLR.  It does almost everything an amateur could ask for to take great photos while on, \"Once in a lifetime\" vacations.  It allows you to zoom out to get a good sharply focused, High Quality picture of wildlife, or landscape items, that sometimes do not want to come in close to you.  Sometimes it is not very safe to be close to a Grizzly Bear or a mother Moose.  With this camera you can still get a nice photo from 300 yards away.  Or, you may not have time (or ability if you are in a wheelchair etc,) to hike up a hill to get a good shot of a waterfall in the distance, or some ruins.  Maybe you would like to take some indoor pictures where a flash is not allowed (many cathedrals in Europe), or not welcomed (ie, romantic underground restaurant with dim lighting).  This camera will do it well.  Yes it is too big to put in your pocket, but it will get pics the pocket cameras can not even see. Also, sports or fast moving wildlife can be taken with this camera where the little pocket camera just will not capture it with out blur and noise. Yet this camera is light weight and small compared to a DSLR and lenses to cover wide-angles 24mm to 720mm focal length lenses that can take low light pictures.  It also takes 1080P HD movies.  The continuous auto-focus is slow on movies which needs to be corrected.  I find it may be better to set the focus and stay at a reasonable focal length during movies and the results are excellent.  This camera can use alkaline batteries fast, but I would much rather be able to get batteries anywhere I am at, than to be on vacation and not be able to get a special Lithium battery just for that one camera.  I got Sanyo Eneloops.  These rechargable NiMH AA batteries discharge very slowly(about 15% of charge after 1 year) and are about 5 times stronger than alkalines. Takes about 10 hours to recharge but they do not develop a memory. Excellent batteries. I seem to be able to take about 400-600 shots, some with flash, with a single charge depending on various settings.  So it is good to have 2 sets charged up at all times.  Also, the camera actually works faster with the Eneloops installed.  I also got a Sandisk Extreme III SDHD 32 Gb Class 10 card.  The camera works much better with this extremely Fast 30Mbps), but very expensive card.  I think it is worth the money to make the camera work so well. It is almost necessary for good HD Video or rapid sport/wildlife shots without waiting for the camera to process several previous pics before you can continue.  Also, the camera will focus and take the shot you want, rather than two seconds later after you pressed the shutter button.  There was an overheating indicator warning after taking several rapid pics or video, but this has been taken care of by a firmware update to be downloaded.  Adobe Camera RAW now supports EXR RAW files.  So, it seems that most of the Cons associated with this camera are negligible or are being rapidly corrected.  I would have to say there is no other camera on the market with the Value and ease of use of this camera.  It is good enough to be very useful to the Pro and will elevate the abilities of a good amateur photographer to new heights,  by allowing great, sharply focused, low noise pics in macro, long zoom, low light, and fast action situations. If you get one, take time to learn all the features.  This camera is simply amazing, what it can do for the amateur without packing a ton of camera gear and spending large amounts of time preparing for a special shot.  It would be the perfect camera if it would fit in my shirt pocket but it is not that large.

The HS20 is much more than a simple point and shoot so additional time is needed to catch the learning curve. I strongly advise you to read the online owners manual and save it to computer desktop for quick reference for at least the first 30 days. You must also purchase a highly rated class 10 SDHC card along with sanyo eneloop or similar type rechargeable NiHI batteries. I realize the owner's manual recommends a class 4 card and alkaline batteries ship with the unit but those are simply inadequate for this powerful camera. I have no issues with my SDHC card writing speed and focus speed when using low to moderate zoom. Just point the lens at your subject, press the shutter button halfway for approximately 1 second, then press the shutter all the way down. Focus speed does slow as you get closer to full zoom but that is to be expected. With a little patience i was able to take quality photos at 30 times zoom without a tripod. I used this camera in all lighting conditions and was highly impressed with the all 4 EXR modes. If I was unsatisfied with the photos in EXR Auto i would just try one of the other 3  EXR modes. One of the four EXR modes worked extremely well for me 90% of the time. For the other 10% I used the Automatic, Pro Low Light, or Portrait modes. In other words I was always able to find the correct setting for current lighting conditions to get the best photo possible. I was always able to take super high quality photos outside in natural light. I prefer the EXR High Resolution for outdoors. Photo quality indoors is  mostly excellent but diminished indoors under dim lighting conditions as i got closer to full zoom.  The photos looked great indoors under dim light while closer to the subject. Indoor photos are little tricky and I found it best to experiment with all 4 EXR modes to get the best results; however,  I am really impressed with EXR Dynamic Range for difficult indoor shots.  All photos taken indoors under well lighted or reasonably lighted conditions were great even while zooming in. You will be happy with the results once you find the correct EXR mode. I recently attended a graduation ceremony inside of a basketball arena and was able to take superb photos of my graduate without a tripod while using very heavy zoom. The photos were crystal clear with no hint blur or shaking.The high definition videos turned out adequate to good with minimal zoom; however, the videos quickly got out of focus as zoom increased. Any thing above 1/4 zoom was almost impossible to watch because the continuous auto focus was totally out of control. This is a real flaw with the camera and I hope Fuji has a firmware upgrade in the works. I applaud Fuji for successfully addressing the high temperature warning issue with their first firmware upgrade.  With all that said i was able to take good videos in natural light about 10 feet from the subject. I also took an acceptable 40 minute video of the graduation under well lighted conditions in a basketball arena. The audio was superb. The video ok until i increased zoom. Fuji does not promote this enough but you can take videos while shooting still photos at same time. I was able to take some excellent photos while in the movie mode.I left most factory setting alone. I only turned on the anti blur and changed movie auto focus to center from continuous.I played around with continuous shooting but never used it seriously. Also I never plan to use any of the manual shooting modes because the effectiveness of EXR make it unnecessary.In short, this is an outstanding still photo camera because of EXR and a usable 30x zoom lens.  Unfortunately the HS20 works as a below average video camera because auto focus hunts around when moderate zoom is applied; however, the videos are acceptable with little zoom and the audio is great.Pros:1. Fully usable 30 x zoom lens2. All 4 EXR modes3. Super IQ(image quality) photos outdoors both day and night4. Great IQ indoors with all lighting conditions5. Light weight6. Ability to take HD videos while shooting still photos at the same time7. Excellent audio while in movie mode8. 16MP allows for no reduction in IQ when cropping9. Saves time because superior IQ reduces the need for photo editing10. I love the Electronic view finder especially when using full zoom. Using your face for support helps alot with stability11. Fast and smooth operation with low to moderate zoom12. Stitching with panoramic shots(you must try this)'Cons:1. Out of control auto focus while shooting video with moderate zoom2. Either too little or no anti vibration/shake support with video3. Slow to focus when approaching full zoomWeakness:1.  Using heavy zoom while indoors, under dim light, and far from the subject when taking still photos. Note - This weakness can be overcome by using less zoom and cropping the photo.'", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "The HS20 is almost a DSLR", "Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "R1E90LLR1FDUFU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the HS20 o/a April 7, 2011 and I began using it right out of the box (I also have the Canon SX10IS and Minolta SLR's).  I have not yet used it to its fullest potential, but so far, here is my initial reaction to the HS20: 1) pictures are vivid and sharp; 2) The manual zoom is a great feature; 3) taking macro pics is super easy (not so with the Canon SX10!!!);  4) zoom range is very good, although a tripod is a must at the higher zoom ranges in order to get the sharpest pics possible; 5) auto focusing is significantly more accurate than the Canon SX10IS.  For the short time that I've been using the camera I give it 4 stars as I really \"like it\".  As I become totally familiar with the myriad of features I believe I will \"love it\" and give it 5 STARS!IMHOP, this camera is as close as you can get to a DSLR and I recommend it to anyone who has thought about buying a DSLR.  I do not recommend the HS20 to users who want to just \"point and shoot\" as they will find it too big and too complicated.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best camera ever. Wow!", "Author": "L. Baker \"JeepinJK\"", "ReviewID": "R3SJL967OVM2H8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: I am considering taking my review down a notch because the camera has been getting slower and the image quality has gone down. I am wondering if it has something to do with the massive amount of pictures taken with it or a half quality sensor. The  processor is slow now where it takes four seconds before you can do anything on the camera. I take mine at half resolution to increase the image quality and reduce file size and that seems to do nothing. Was five stars, now four. It makes me really sad but it's true.This was an upgrade from my fuji s2550hd which I out grew in about 6 mounths and it took another 6 until I got the Hs20exr. I had researched it for a long time and when it was out of the box I was very excited.I currently use this camera for theater, nature, star shooting, event(non professional) and soon I will be taking pictures of sports. All of those gave me no trouble to find but one did and might for you. Finding minimum shutter speed was a bit of a challenge for star shots. Since you have probably graduated and grown out of a low level bridge camera you know that you usually find the most extreme of low or high shutter speeds in shutter priority that is where I devoted most of my search for the minimum shutter speed. Actually I found it in the manual mode had it and I went out the same night to take some star pics and this is one of the very few clear nights in Idaho since I have gotten this camera. I took 30 second exposures and they turned out stunning but it was very cold outside.There is a lot to cover so I'll start from the front and go to the back. The first thing that actually scared me a little was the lens cap. It could easily scratch the lens if you are not careful but I treat this thing like royalty so there aren't a lot of worries for me but it is certainly something to worry about.The thirty time zoom is all I have ever needed and I have noticed that the higher zooms are a waste of time because when we were testing the nikon p500 we had to search for things that needed 36 time zoom but in a situation where you just want to get closer to the action the 30x zoom is more than enough. The Fujinon lens has a 24mm wide angle which is stunning and is the best wide angle I have seen and unlike some of the lesser point and shoots it produces a full image and it doesn't look cropped like some of the 27 or 28 millimeter wide angles show.The manual zoom ring is very nice and I have no complaints. It is very smooth and is perfectly synchronized to the turn. There is a lot of criticism towards this camera with the manual zoom in video mode. If you turn it slowly it is pretty steady and again there are no complaints for me about it.Then there is the manual focus ring which is pretty easy to use but my recommendation is to go into the settings menu which has volume and all of that and turn zoom check off. In low light situations it is a little annoying when it uses crop factor and digitally zooms in to complete blackness when you use the manual focus.Info on the shoe mount flashThe pop up flash is excellent with no washout and there is not a lot to tell.December 26th 2011.Alright, so I have gotten the ef-42 flash and the ttl works very well. If you want more to read about the ef-42 go to the ef-42 product page on this website but the function works fine but the Af assist light will not come on with the Hs20. You don't absolutely need this flash but for someone who can get the Ef-42, I think this is an excellent accessory and for event shooting it is an essential.The view finder is a pleasure to use especially when you are in a theater where you don't want to blind the people behind you and the eye sensor is nice but there is a toggle button just to the right so if you want to control it manually, you can. There is a little wheel on the left side of the viewfinder to focus the viewfinder display if it doesn't come out of the box in focus but mine did.The five control buttons on the far left on the camera are a blessing and they all have double functions and to ease you worries about cropping images inside the camera you can use the AE button to zoom out and the  ISO button to zoom in during playback. The rest are for you to explore.The 3 inch 450k display is very useful and the tilt out feature is sturdy but I do recommend you get a screen protector for it as soon as possible.The instant record mode is very fast and  makes turning to the record mode on the command dial and missing the moment a thing of the past.The four direction pad is very well operating and all of the quick access functions like raw shooting, macro, self timer, and flash controls can be instantly accessed from the direction pad. All the other buttons are pretty common on other cameras so there isn't a lot to say.Then up to the mode dial, you have your EXR mode which has several options which can be accessed by the menu/ok button at the center of the direction pad. Then going down you have the auto then Adv. which has pro focus mode which blurs the background but keeps the center subject in focus and pro low light mode which takes several shots and puts them together to get one high quality image which makes the one image look stunning. Two scene position modes which have different scenes like sunset and party for indoor events to give the best picture for all of these and many more. I particularly like the sunset mode which perfectly contrasts the sunlight. Then there is the panorama mode which is a true sweep panorama and it has three settings, the 360 degree, the 180 degree, and the 120 degree which produce very nice panoramas and they are superior to most of the other panoramas in other cameras I have seen. There are the 5 programable modes which brings fujifilm back to its old self with all of the programable modes possible. These have all been a pleasure to use.The next feature is the toggle dial which is the only way of toggling functions in the program modes and it was pretty easy to adjust to from using the direction pad like most cameras would have you do.Then you have your rapid shoot button which has several speeds and amounts of shots. This function is very fun to use and captures the action very well. This is related to the high speed video function which is useful from 80 to 160 frames per second but 320 is very bad quality and is fun to look at but it is unimaginable how bad it would look on the computer screen but the other high speed functions are fine. You can access these functions in the shooting menu and you can set the video mode for 2 variations of HD, standard quality, 80 fps HS, 160 fps HS, and 320 fps HS. The other video functions are also nice and the sound quality is excellent.Then you have a value button which is to the left of the rapid shoot button and in the manual mode goes from for example shutter speed to aperture and so on.Then there is the Auto focus illuminator that is located between the grip and the lens barrel which is a little bright to use in a theater setting so I have turned it off. This can be accessed by the cameras menu where you toggle shutter volume and focus check.The on and off switch is easy to adjust to from the usual zoom toggle that is there on most cameras and the shutter button is just a shutter button. For me the adjustment from zoom toggle to power switch was easy.The memory card socket is on the right side of the camera and it directly mirrors an slr. This is convenient to use so you don't need to take it off a tripod or fumble around with the batteries in the same chamber like what you will find in most other cameras. Then the battery chamber is just below that in the bottom of the camera. One final socket in the Hs20 is on the far left side of the camera and has the AV out, the usb out, and the hdmi out. Just above the cable sockets on the left side of the camera is the speaker.The build quality of this camera is extremely sturdy and it is rubberized so it has a quality feel and that is an accurate feeling because this is a well built camera which of course is what all fuji cameras have in common.The auto focus is usually accurate and always fast. If you can't auto focus that is what the manual focus is for. The camera turns on quickly and can take a picture in just over 4 seconds after flipping the power switch. The whole camera is fast so I would recommend it to someone like me who knows more than the average person and who wants to get into photography more and where more manual, faster, and performance oriented functions are needed.Chances are you would have graduated from an older camera or a new camera like a, nikon l110(2008)/l120(2011), a fujifilm s2550(2008)/2950(2011), or some kind of cyber shot that is a little less capable and none of these cameras are as fast or sophisticated. If that isn't the case and you have come from a 3x zoom pocket camera that you barely understand, the Hs20exr is not for you. It is beginner friendly but save your money and go for a fujifilm f500, nikon s8100, fujifilm s2950, or Canon sx130. Keep in mind that the Hs20 is not an slr but it can easily surpass them in most respects. I have written this review in the interest of what I would have liked to be in there when I was researching. I know there are many others who would like a review that comes out and says what an average user thinks and how it performs in pretty challenging curcumstances as opposed to the profffesionals who have worked with 2000 dollar cameras (10000 dollars with a Nikon D3x) for all of their careers. This camera has its own personality and there is not a camera like it. You have your sx30s or nikon p500s but still none come close in functionality to the hs20 and another thing is they are all alike. I personally love this camera and there has not been anything that it can't accomplish. The image quality is the best I have ever seen and it is almost as fast as an slr.  I do hope this has helped you and my recommendation is for the Hs20exr because it is the best and at home I continuously test the it and it is supreme.Update: I am considering taking my review down a notch because the camera has been getting slower and the image quality has gone down. I am wondering if it has something to do with the massive amount of pictures taken with it or a half quality sensor.

I hope this review will help someone, especially for those who have a DSLR, looking for something light for travel, walk-around, etc.I hate to give a lengthy review, but this cam has too many features, I have no choice!  I might repeat something that someone else has already mentioned, but I think emphasis is necessary.I've had my K-x for almost one year now, I really enjoyed it.  When I went out with family, I usually carried the K-x with one lens on, either 18-55mm or 55-300mm (sometimes 35mm F2.4 for low light shooting).  Many times I wished I had the other lens with me, either I needed wider or more reach.  So I started to look for a camera that could give me that kind of flexibility and versatility.  Of course I could get a 18-250 lens for this reason.One reason I bought HS20 is that K-x is very loud (the sound of mirror flip) when I press the shutter, this is pretty awkward when silence is needed.  HS20 can be completely muted!Another reason is that I've been interested in EXR technology which seems very interesting and appealing.Finally Adobe now supports RAW format of EXR cameras, this probably the deal breaker for me since I have been using Adobe stuff.My search criteria basically include:1. shooting in RAW, so I can get best possible image quality;2. manual zoom ring (as I'm used to DSLR lenses);3. AA batteries (K-x uses AA too);4. macro is a plus (a decent macro lens for DSLR costs as much as or more than this camera itself);My first impression is that this camera is light weighted (even lighter than my K-x with 18-55mm lens), but feels pretty solid in hands.I would suggest that when you get the camera, don't rush out and shoot in low light condition because you will get disappointed with the noise in the pictures.  Instead, shoot in good light which will give you impressive images.  Also before you decide to keep or return it, give it at least three week workout (the lens is jerky at start, but will become smooth after using daily for a few weeks).It's a keeper for me because I have had a lot of fun with it!  I took HS20 with me on my family vacation to Orlando in early August, it was very hot (around 95-100 outside).  Here is what I found out so far:In good light condition, the IQ is good if not great!  The straight out of box JPEG gives good color, fine detailed, good DR, etc (Of course you need to change some settings first).  You will get more control with the raw files.RAW is a must-have feature for me, because it gives me more out of the camera, especially for ISO above 800.  I bought FZ40 before K-x and returned it mainly due to the IQ (the RAW files look ugly on the screen).  The RAW files of HS20 look much better than FZ40 in LR3. Still looking grainy, but in more pleasant way.  ISO-1600 photos look arguably acceptable after NR (I printed out one 4x6 which looks not bad at all).  Once I transfer all the files from HS20 to my computer, I use Adobe DNG Convertor to convert all RAF to DNG in a batch, then imported to LR3.  There are two benefits for me: 1. cut down file size from 24MB (Large RAF) to 15MB (sometimes you will get 12MB RAF when using M mode), no quality loss here; 2. DNG will stay as long as Adobe exists.  Since I used DNG format all the time, I feel safer.  Although Adobe support HS20 raw format, but it doesn't come with lens profile for HS20, so I had to create one myself (using Adobe Lens Profile Creator), the result is pretty close to JPEG out of box.  I hope Adobe will release one LCP soon.Those buttons on the back are very convenient. The layout makes a lot of sense. I can make changes more quickly.  I wish my K-x had some of those buttons or the same layout.  I think once you get familiar with all that, you will feel at home with DSLRs, or vice versa.The tilt LCD is very useful when shooting macro / super macro or at any situation you need it flip.Manual Focus: the ring location is pretty awkward, I found only useful when shooting macro or super macro mode, useless otherwise, nothing like manual focus on DSLR lens.Video: set the focal length, and shoot.  Don't use zoom when shooting, you will be happy.  In low light condition, the video is actually pretty good, noise is well controlled.  Although the feature is there, I would not recommend to take picture while recording video because it will cause some frames loss, so when playing back you will see jumping at the gap (where a picture was taken).*** Heat warning kept coming up and shutting down itself when I was shooting video at Disney World (outside temperature is about 95-100).  I almost returned it because of this!  I think HS20 is designed for northern users...because I never had the warning when shooting at home!Low light without flash: be prepared to give up some image quality since you have to boost the ISO to 1600 to get decent speed.  IS works for a few stop, but be realistic, in low light condition, you need very steady hands or support, or use 2 sec self timer to help.  Also don't zoom in too much since the aperture will become smaller and smaller.  Think of those good low light performers like S95, LX5, XZ-1, they all have small range of zoom.  Using EVF also helps, but resolution of EVF is killing me (I'm so used to the OVF of my K-x).When using 126mm (660mm / 720mm) to shoot, any photos over ISO200 will lose details (I think it's due to small sensor).I think \"compromised\" is the right word to describe this camera, which has lots of \"DSLR\" features, but come to action, it's slow, AF slow, freeze after each shot (you can set IMAGE DISP off to overcome this or get at least 1.5 sec faster), etc.  Over all, compared to my K-x, the speed is not there.  So I wouldn't use HS20 if I need speed or for real low light jobs. My K-x will be much faster at focusing and shooting time - high ISO would no doubt be much better too.This camera is NOT for beginners, period.  The auto mode (except EXR Auto) for P&S; is not working well out of box.  You have to deal with those settings and find out which works best for you.  This is definitely a bridge camera, a good one if not the best in the market.  I think the learning curve is pretty BIG, even for a DSLR user.HS20 is appealing for weight and silence (you can turn all sounds off) and cost.After realized the limits of this camera, I appreciate my K-x more (especially the speed)! That's absolutely positive.  I will keep HS20 as a walk-around and travel cam.  For other situations I still prefer my K-x.Thank you for reading, hope this helps.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera! Months of research and thrilled I chose this one", "Author": "Randy", "ReviewID": "R1ALZTY3HY509P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several months researching bridge cameras, I decided to give the HS20EXR a shot being aware of the need to update the firmware and sub-par video capabilities. Before taking even one picture I updated the firmware(which took all of 5 minutes) and have not received one error message and lets face it, while video shooting is nice, a digital camera's prime feature is taking pictures, not videos.  I wanted to wait a couple of days with playing with the camera in various settings  and with various features before I wrote this review to be as honest as possible. The camera's macro capability is one of the best I've seen, the EXR Auto mode makes this camera beginner friendly while offering an abundance of manual controls for the more experienced user, and the manual zoom seems to be smoother than most reviews lead me to believe. I would consider myself an intermediate user so I tend to use the EXR mode to try and capture the best possible shot, and no matter the condition it does not fail. However, when I feel like learning more features there are several manual modes to control, all features or only certain parts such as shutter speed. The menu buttons around the camera back the menu pages a breeze to navigate and I would have to say this is possibly the friendliest menu I've experienced.  The only two negatives I have experienced with the camera are the battery drain and the focusing. The batteries I used lasted only about 350 pictures and they were fresh out of the package. However, those were alkaline which I know are the last thing to use in a camera but having forgotten the rechargeable ones at home, they were a quick buy to get me through an Aquarium trip. The other problem I experienced with this camera is it seems to take forever to focus and I would say about a quarter or so of the time it would not be able to focus on the subject(throughout all ranges of zoom).  I know it was a bit lengthy, but this camera has a lot to offer. Two final notes, don't buy this camera, use it for a day and expect to know it inside and out. Also, I have read about people complaining about the write speed, I currently am using a class 6 and the speed is plenty quick. Coupled with the camera's internal cache, this allows for being able to quickly take succesive shots. It takes getting used to, reading of the manual, and trial and error with the various settings. As long as you aren't expecting a DSLR but something mighty close and are primarily interested in photos, this camera will not disappoint!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fatally flawed", "Author": "Pericombobulation53", "ReviewID": "R2BOC7MH3UWEF8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Oh man, I wanted so much to like this camera.  A professional photographer once told me that Fuji cameras were highly under-rated, and were actually some of the best in the industry.  I have an older Fuji S6000fd that I absolutely love, so I always thought she was right.  My expectations for the HS20 were very high, and in a lot of ways those high expectations were met.  But for as good as this camera is at so many things, it has one fatal flaw which caused me to send it back... focus.First off, the HS20 retains many of the things I love about my old S6000fd.  It takes a filter, which is a huge deal for me.  Why would you spend hundreds of dollars on a new camera and then subject the lens to dirt, fingerprints, and scratches?  A cheap filter protects your investment, and near as I can tell, the Fujis are the only cameras that take a filter, out of the box.  Second, I despise push-button zoom mechanisms.  As far as I know, Fuji is the only company wise enough to put a manual zoom on their bridge cameras.  I know this is a personal preference, but I really like manual zoom thank you very much.  I saw some reviews which said the action of the zoom on this camera is choppy (not smooth).  That is true to some extent... after all, it's not a DSLR, and the zoom is not as smooth as you'll find on a good DSLR lens.  But it's fine, and you'll get used to it, the same way you get used to a car that has a somewhat touchy accelerator or brake pedal.This camera does some amazing things in low light (when it can achieve focus).  Just for fun, while playing around with it one night, I zoomed all the way in on an object across the room.  Low light.  800 mm zoom.  Hand-held.  And it got the shot!  With very little noise too.  It seems to do this by taking several individual shots and then combining them and reducing noise.  Impressive.The HDR settings are helpful too.  I wanted a camera that can do HDR because I like to take a lot of outdoor/scenic shots and I'm sick of the background being washed out or the subject being underexposed (or both!).  HDR takes multiple shots at different exposures and combines them, picking the best pixels from each.  Some photography purists say it's cheating, but I say so what?  If it results in an image that is pleasing, and more representative of what it would look like to the naked eye, then who gets hurt?  The HS20 in EXR mode did produce some nice results in high contrast situations.The Pro Focus mode is nice too.  This is another feature I was really looking for in my next camera.  It purposely blurs the background of portrait shots, in order to emphasize the subject.  When it works, it looks great... the subject is sharp while the background has an appropriate level of fuzz.  The problem is, more often than not, when I went to use Pro Focus mode, I got an error on the display saying \"Cannot Create Effect.\"  Sometimes if I zoomed out and back in again or recomposed the shot a little differently I could get it to work, but often it just wouldn't work no matter what I did.  This is especially true in low light, which is odd because I always thought better cameras did this by using a very wide aperture (low f-stop number) to produce a very narrow depth of field.  In low light conditions, the aperture will probably be very wide anyway, so it's surprising that Pro Focus has so much trouble. I suspect it uses another means to achieve this effect, probably taking multiple shots again and combining them, kinda like it does with HDR.  Again, the results are great when it works, but all too often it just wouldn't let me take the shot.Panorama mode functions very well on this camera and produces nice results.  No complaint here, though I must admit I'm having trouble figuring out what to do with panorama shots once I take them.  Since they are so wide, they don't look good on regular photo paper.  I think you can get them printed on canvas, but must pay extra since the size will have to be custom.  They don't fit on a computer screen either.  I'm starting to think that panorama mode is a neat gimmick, but a gimmick nonetheless...One gimmick I quite liked was the ability to switch from LCD to EVF when it senses your eye near the camera.  I expected this would drive me nuts, but it actually worked very well, allowing me to fiddle with controls on the easier to read LCD, then switch seamlessly over to EVF mode to compose the shot.Now as to the HS20's real Achilles heel - focus (or lack thereof).  Let's just say that it does more hunting than Elmer Fudd on the opening day of rabbit season.  After reading other reviews, I knew this camera had a focus problem, but I didn't realize just how bad it is.  Even in bright daylight outdoors it hunts and hunts and hunts.  And sometimes it appears to finally find and lock focus, only to lose it again the moment you snap the picture.  The focus problem is even worse indoors.  And it makes movie mode almost completely useless.  All my movies ended up being a frustration-festival as the camera constantly struggled to focus.  At one point I set the camera on the end of our piano and let it record my wife and son singing and playing.  The camera was completely stationary and the subjects were moving little more than their mouths and fingers and STILL it couldn't keep focus!  Even more frustrating, the manual focus is useless indoors.  For some reason it turns the screen almost black as soon as you touch the focus control.  Try focusing when you can't see what you're focusing on... Impossible!The focus issue is really a shame, because if it worked right, this would be one heck of a camera at a very reasonable price.  It would be a real challenger to entry level DSLRs for a lot less money.  The overall build quality of the HS20 is very high... it feels great in the hand, the controls are easy to operate, and it is capable of great things, especially in low light and high contrast situations.  I handled some of the HS20's competitors in retail stores (such as the Sony DSC HX100v, Canon SX30is, Nikon P500) and none of them even come close to the experience of using the Fuji bridge cameras.  There's so much to love here that you could easily skip the expensive DSLR route and yearn for nothing.  But the lack of focus is a real deal-breaker.  With a tear in my eye, I sent it back.  The HS20 is fatally flawed and all the other bridge cameras are little more than glorified point and shoots to me, so I think it's time to bite the bullet and buy a DSLR.  I've had SLRs before (back when 35mm was king) so I know what I'm in for.

It takes stunning shots with negligible drawbacks.So, first off, the zoom. The 30x zoom is more than enough to do just about anything from taking detailed pictures of ivy from 50 feet off to getting that perfect candid shot. I found that the best mode to be in is actually sport mode- it seems to reduce blur the most. The control ring is well done, and made so that you can use it one handed while holding the camera.The speed shooting button is very helpful, with a bunch of different modes, up to 11/fps for 32 frames. The rest of the button layout seems to be well thought out as well, I had no problems there. The focus ring also works well. The digital focus has a few quirks, however. Sometimes it jumps and seems to zoom in digitally, then zoom back out while you're trying to take a picture. It also has trouble with lighting- sometimes, when you change the focus a little, the display or viewfinder goes dark and you have to zoom out and them back in again.- for that, I would give the camera 4.5 stars, but unfortunately I can't. The viewfinder is useful, and can automatically sense your eye, but I've had to turn that off, because it sometimes switches if you hold it close to your stomach or chest. The display is clear and the swivel function useful- shame it doesn't swivel out for self portraits though...I found most of the main modes useful, though occasionally they had irritating parts.This is advertised as the easy out of the box superzoom. That doesn't mean you take it out of the box, pop in the thoughtfully included batteries, and start clicking. Be prepared to spend several hours, or even days if necessary, going through the manual, then going out and testing something out, then coming back, realizing you messed it all up, and going out again. You may need to repeat this several times before you start to feel comfortable with the camera.Speaking of comfort, while the hand grip is very nice, the included neck strap chafes horribly until you turn it inside out with the Fujifilm logo facing your neck. I think it's safe to say that that was not the intention of Fujifilm, but hey. And don't worry- when you do turn it inside out, it's actually very comfortable.Almost done, so stick with me. Weight: I was worried that the camera would be too heavy, but it's really fairly light and easy to carry around and shoot one handed.And lastly, some other recommendations- the Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Camera Case (Black)is a great case. It fits the camera, its strap, extra batteries, an extra SD card, your USB cord, and maybe another small thing. That's really all you should need, except for a tripod- which you DO need, especially if you're shooting at high zooms. I also got the PNY 16 GB Flash Memory Card. It's class 10 and works at 20 MB/s and is plenty fast for the camera. The last thing I got was rechargeable batteries- a must.In conclusion, it's a great all-around camera that will work for nearly anybody.

Rogers", "ReviewID": "R1R370N1W5CZA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive only had this camera for two days of shooting and though ive tried shooting in as many conditions and variables as possible, this camera has yet to leave me unsatisfied. It does have a bit of a learning curve coming from a simple point and shoot and I recommend you brush up online on the basics of ISO,AF,AE and F stop if you havent and are considering this camera. I received mine from Ritz Camera and the serial number is the 1BA series and no heat issues thus far in the summer sun and heat of NY. The manual focus ring does take some getting used to but the control you get is great. Id have to say my favorite feature as a wildlife photographer is the burst shots in the different numbers and modes variety. I will put up a stellar photo of a blinded moth i took today in super macro. I added some vingenette border and cropping of about 60% image size increase.I will update this review if anything changes, but so far I recommend this camera to those looking at a DSLR budget alternative. Shooting wild critters demands a zoom and macro beyond a sane budget in the SLR world for me. You may not make national geographic magazine photos with this, but you'll be pretty dang close. Also panorama mode is super sweetTwo final notes: the minimum F stop is 5.6 at max zoom (2.8 at wide no zoom) (see below reply for better explanation). Secondly,I tried out the slow-motion video on 320x112 @ 320 frames per second and can not begin to express how cool of a feature this is in addition to this great camera. Ive read reviews of people complain about the video, but I did not buy the camera for video so have no say in the matter.Happy Clicking!", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is one really good camera", "Author": "ezyErnie \"ezyErnie\"", "ReviewID": "RSS5PQC8M5JV0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got interested in the HS20 after looking at the HS10 and the S200EXR. The one consistent thread through the reviews was that those two cameras have excellent picture quality. later, I went to the Fujifilm website and there I found their blurb (about 8 pages) listing the incredibly extensive feature set that was built into the HS20EXR. The CMOS, rather than CCD, chip, the EXR technology and the 30x zoom were strong selling points, but the end result has to be a picture you can enjoy. The HS20EXR fall into the category of 'bridge' camera, apparently because it falls just short of DSLR capability but far exceeds your typical point-and-shoot.So I got the camera shortly after release and the first thing I noticed was that there are many multi-purpose and single-purpose buttons and a VERY extensive menu system which varies with the mode of operation you have set for the camera. I went back to the BASIC MANUAL (on paper) which comes with the camera. It primarily walks you through an introduction to the automatic features of the camera. I think that is the best way to start, because this camera has so much to it that you cheat yourself if you take shortcuts. The extended, full manual comes in PDF (136 pages), which makes it inconvenient if you're testing or using any of the more complex features out in the real world, away from your computer. But You can review that manual, as I do, and try out the settings and features.If you read up on the EXR tech at the Fuji site, you see it does a heckuvalot of work, especially in EXR Auto. however, there are four(4) EXR settings. I experimented with them all and I prefer the hi-resolution setting. The theme here is \"try it out and test the settings\". I also tried the regular AUTO setting and experimented with that and ran through some menu settings that were adjustable and tested the camera at those settings. I won't list them here because there are too many and I won't rehash the manual. But I will say, \"READ IT!\"  The post-shot delay varies with the number of features you have active. in EXR auto, it can be 2+ seconds. I'm still experimenting with the features to determine which combination of setting will give the best results, but I will say that a full second seems to be the standard delay in single-shot modes. Low-light photos take longer to save than photos taken in daylight or 'bright' light situations.At an awards dinner, I took over 100 pictures in EXR Auto and sure enough, the camera tracked multiple faces prior to the shots. One big caveat, sometimes the flash did not go off when I snapped the pic the first time but would flash on the second try. I think the camera was doing too much analysis. The auto-exposure might have been confused. My walking tour of lower Manhattan yielded pictures of the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building and some botanical oasis in the middle of Greenwich Village. The amount of detail in the zoomed pics and the close-ups were excellent. I took a picture of the Empire State Building from a mile away and progressively zoomed in on the antenna. No tripod or monopod. I just braced myself against a mailbox or a wall. The amount of detail was stunning. I took pics of the Statue of Liberty earlier from Battery Park and you could make out people through the window in the base. Likewise the people at the top of the ESB. you could almost make out their faces. At that amount of zoom, holding the camera with two hands, the credit must go to the image stabilization. All that said, even this camera won't prevent me from taking a bad picture, but Of 322 shots I took in my Manhattan walking tour, only one was a throwaway.Two extremely nice features are 1) Three(3) film-type settings to allow for Vivid (Velvia) STD(Provia) and Sepia allow for some creativity and 2) Jpeg and Jpeg Fine are great options to have in choosing picture characteristics. I experimented with this, too. I eventually settled on the STD setting for film type as it seemed most accurate. I chose jpeg over jpeg fine as there seemed to be no difference perceptible to my eyes.I wanted to test the manual settings and did so as much as I could. I was a bit frustrated because in any of the manual modes, the camera still adjusted one of the settings, aperture, f-stop. ISO or shutter speed. I was able to get some passable-to-good pictures, but I think it will be better as I experiment more. In low-light, I was able to take pictures with extremely low noise at ISO settings 800 or below. Higher ISO settings still were mostly consistently noise free if the colors of the subject were strong. some of the more bland colors or low-light photos had more noise than those shot with regular light. There is a setting for noise reduction to be found in the menu (again reading the manual really helps) I set it to low noise reduction. There is also a menu for White Balance. I recommend experimenting with it as it suits you. There are several settings you can select from including AUTO.I worked with two burst mode options: 1) \"Top #\", for taking a sequence of shots varying from 4-32 at rates varying from 3-11 fps and \"best frame\" that took 8 shots in succession, which was used for capturing a rapid sequence of action shots. Both modes would take the complete sequence of shots, unless you release the shutter button earlier, before saving them in roughly four-to-seven seconds, in my experience. In \"Top #\", mode, I set the camera for 8fps and 32max and took some shots of the traffic on the street. The camera was set for \"P\"(Program Mode), which seems a bit faster and smarter than \"Auto\" mode capturing 32 frames and saving them in less than 10 seconds. This was in daylight with White Balance set to 'auto'. All pictures were excellent, depth of field was limited, but I had set the AF and AE values for pinpoint focus and metering. That likely saved some \"think time\" for the camera and sped things up a bit. For 'best capture' mode, I took pictures of some dancers performing . The pictures were consistently very good to excellent in quality. The lighting was indoors and not strong, so I had ISO set at 800 and shutter speed at 1/20-1/30 sec. The pictures took a while longer to save (12-15 sec for 8 pictures)than in daylight. There are three additional burst modes which take 3 shots varying film type, dynamic range or exposure. I tried them and they each add flexibility without having to change camera settings during a shoot. You should have a large, at least 8Gb, card and I strongly recommend class 10 or higher. You use up space quickly, even though the pictures are about 1/2 the size of a standard shot when 11fps is selected.I took some RAW photos. There did not seem to be any post-shot lag vs. jpeg. The software provided by Fujifilm doesn't do much at all with RAW.  If you're an Adobe user, it appears that they will just be the usual lag time before they can handle RAW from this camera. Until that becomes available, I use Irfanview, which seems to work with every picture format I've encountered.I tried out the HD video operation and it worked OK. I suggest that this is another feature you should familiarize yourself with so you can get the best out of the camera.I bought the Sanyo Eneloops for use with this camera. I got over 600 shots, many with flash, before a recharge was required. I say this because this camera has a number of energy-consuming features, especially in EXR Auto mode.I read the complaints about heat. My batch did not seem to have that problem. My camera has not exhibited any serious problem (fingers crossed) at all attributed to the manufacturer(unless you count the above-mentioned flash behavior). I added the firmware update without incident, but never had that alert show up anyway.MY FINAL ASSESSMENT IS FIVE STARS. This camera delivers a tremendous number of features for function, convenience and special photographic capabilities including that awesome 30X zoom, which works quite exceptionally well, thank you. I know that I did not want the extra lenses and the associated inconvenience, but I wanted the best camera I could get that had the most features and most of all, the best picture quality. I have two friends who are professional photographers and they have been quite impressed with this camera. As an aspiring amateur, all I can say is this camera takes some amazing pictures now and I have a lot of learning to do to get the best of what this camera can do. I am looking forward to the journey. It has been a lot of fun so far.Addendum of July 8, 2012: I dropped a star (to 4 stars) for the following reasons:1) the camera has awful low-light performance for the following reasons: a) It tries to compensate, in most modes, by lengthening exposure time and it is worst when AUTO mode is selected. Also, the colors in low-light pictures are exaggerated2) the EXR feature never appears to be turned off, even in what is supposed to be Fully manual mode. Even in Manual mode, there is some alteration of settings as I am preparing to take pictures, most notably, aperture.3) when LARGE format for pictures is selected, almost any significantly large single-color area of a picture seems to be full of artifacts, like the area was painted with tiny brushes. MEDIUM is the preferred selection, but now you're stuck with an excellent 8MegaPixel camera, not 16Meg. Though detail is pretty good, it still suffers when the pic is enlarged, even a little.4) the interaction with the EF-42 flash is problematic with manual modes selected. AUTO mode is preferred with the external flash, but there is an annoying lag between flashes and I've missed good shots because of that. additionally, since the flash is a rebooted Sunpak, red-eye and multi-shot modes are not possible, i.e., it's not really made for Fujifilm cameras and is just TTY compatible.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "stunning detail, many features! best all in one so far!", "Author": "WD1989", "ReviewID": "RB0H05D3YI3E9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "recieved mine this morning! pictures are stunning so far, improvement in speed, lots of stuff to learn carefully, my 10mp s1500 took great pictures, but this 16mp hs20 is amazing, takes practice, only have used exr auto so far, auto focus is faster...put hood on right away for protection, buying uv filter for added protection on monday...30x zoom is really good , just practice on how to hold camera....cant wait to go to zoo for photographs......80 of 100 pictures came out excellant focus...detail on the right shots are beautiful......for the many features it has it is well worth the price, so far...will update next week....William  .................UPDATE APRIL 23  downloaded firmware upgrade to solve overheating problem....now I have the camera ive dreamed of! with features and \"such high quality\" photographs nothing comes close!, ive done over 1,000 photographs and only 25 were out of focus, the film simulations are awesome, if you cant take beautiful photographs with this camera then you just need a little more practice,  remember to use a class\"10\" sd card for fastest transfer and eliminate screen preview or reduce to 1.5 sec.......video looks good but is secondary to me, I bought this camera to replace the cost of thousands for a canon with several lenses, to much hassle and weight carrying all that around.....if your looking for an excellant all in one, this is it, the best so far..and \"low light\" capture is superior to most.....William", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Expected (and Hoped) For More", "Author": "Robin Schleien", "ReviewID": "R11R87ZSHVB52J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After several months of researching super-zooms, I had selected the HS20 based on superior specs and early reviews. I purchased the camera on April 7th and promptly returned it within 24 hours.  To be fair, I rated overall image quality as very good.  Controls are simple and I particularly liked the addition of button on the rear left (similar to my Nikon D90).  THat's the good news.The bad news is that within 5 minutes of shooting indoor samples using EXR Auto and burst mode, the temperature warning light came on.  Shutting down the camera, I let it rest for a couple minutes and restarted the process.  Irrespective of shooting mode, the warning light continued to come on.. go out and reappear. Note that I was using the batteries right out of the Fuji box and later switched them up for another brand new set.  No difference.My feeling is that for $499, the consumer should not have to \"settle\" for a flaw as fundamental as this.  In so many respects, this camera is superior (IMO) to the other top alternatives I assessed (Lumix FZ100, Nikon P500, Canon IX30).  Dollars aside, this was a no-brainer.  An over-heating camera on the other hand is not acceptable and I most certainly am not the only consumer who has run across this issue.

I own a Lumix FZ-18 and have been waiting for a camera with the advertised qualities of the  Finepix HS-20.

I love the low light capabilities and all of the very user friendly features.  I will add much more specific information to this review in the coming weeks, but I wanted to say that if you are looking for a great all around camera and don't want the hassle and expense of the DSLR lenses and weight, then this IS the camera that you have been waiting for.  I'm waiting for my UV lense to arrive before I do too much more photography to protect my lense, but I have been blown away by almost every shot so far!  The build quality is very solid and it does everything that I have wanted form a camera.  Great job Fujifilm!!!!!4.7.2011 Update.  Camera is still producing outstanding results.  I have always wanted a camera with these features that produce these results all in one package without extra lenses and weight to carry around.  I really like the focus ring which makes it so much easier to frame the photo.  I will be adding more information and posting sample photos in the coming weeks.  If you are considering a super zoom, this is worth a serious look.  This does a nice job in low light without using a tripod which I have always wanted in a camera.  Tripods are great, but you don't always have an opportunity or even want to use a tripod for many occasions.4.14.2011 Update.  Camera is producing excellent photos in all conditions.  Very satisfied.  Just tried the video yesterday and it is unusable due to the focus problems.  I did not purchase this with the intent of using the video so it's not critical, but I wish it worked better for the few times that I might use it.4.20.2011 Critical Update.  Took the camera to the beach for a family get-a-way!  Took the best pictures ever, but I experienced the dreaded temperature warning that I had only ready about up to this point.  I'm very disappointed because this camera has taken the best pictures EVER!  I used the Sport mode and took some incredible action shots of our son and friend experiencing the crashing of the cold waves on them.  This mode let's you totally follow the subject in the viewfinder and using the zoom the shots were the best action candid shots ever.  The bad news is that the camera displayed the heat warning shutting down my fun photography which is a KILLER for me.  The last time was while I was taking some shots of them go cart racing on a cooler evening.  Regardless of how much I love this camera and I do love it for a bridge camera, I cannot keep it which is very disappointing.  The idea that the camera is going to tell me when I can and can't take photos is just unacceptable.  This coupled with the video that is unusable due to the focusing problems means that I will be contacting Amazon for a return.  The good news is that a great Super Zoom is around the corner...hopefully someone will get it right.  If Fuji can take the feedback and make a few improvements, then this will be awesome.  The final observation is that the weight of the camera was a bit heavy after a few moments.

I was looking for a \"manual\" barrel zoom and this was about the only choice, the 30x was a bonus, and the rest of the specs were outstanding.Overall, I am very pleased. This camera takes great pictures and has many neat \"tricks\" like taking multiple exposures of stationary objects at night to remove noise.The zoom range is nothing short of incredible! People assume pictures taken from wide angle to max zoom from the same spot are from different locations as the zoom range is almost telescopic :)Ok, now for the bad news, this camera has 2 Achilles heels. First, focus! Dear Lord how did this camera get produced with this abysmal of a focus system! It hunts (and not well) even in bright light, in low light forget it, better have a flashlight to shine your subject and focus lock. Manual focus is a joke, I think that wheel is there for entertainment (frustration) purposes only.The other issue is a strange SD write issue. After you take a shot, it will not let you take another picture till it completes writing of the first. Now, you can take multiple images in burst mode, but once you let off the shutter you sit and wait till it completes the write before you can take any more, peculiar and frustrating at sports events.. Combine with the hunting focus and you can just leave this camera at home for night or indoor sports.So, you are probably wondering why I gave this camera 4 stars given those significant drawbacks. Well, this camera is really that good (and let me tell you when you can forgive that focus system, you have got to have something extra special going on ;).It is quick to start up, choosing mode is easy, many creative settings, good face recognition (although this slows focus (if you can believe that) so I have to turn it off most of the time unless doing portrait work), and THAT ZOOM, Wow. Stabilization is good, flash is ok (would like second curtain option, but I digress), and finally I am a fan of the AA battery choice, may not last as long as battery pack but it is nice being able to run into a corner store for batteries in a pinch. In short if this thing could learn to focus it would be near perfect. I have owned many DSLR's and even own a 3D camera (but that is a different review), this is a great camera. It frustrates me with it's focus, but I still take it everywhere, from vacations to weddings to homecoming (though may not take it to any more homecomings as that was frustrating), I can still get shots no one else can (bonus if they are in focus ;).Fuji, if you are listening, if you can make the X-S1 this camera with a decent focus and SD write control, you will steal much market share from Canon and Nikon !My $.02", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "C.

It is an upgrade from the camera we had that we bought in 2008.  The multiple options (EXR, AUTO, SCENE Selection, and ADVANCED) allow for me to exercise quality control.  Images tend to be clear and the color that is captured is fairly consistent.  It is nice to be able to adjust the aspect ratio to multiple sizes and the dynamic range.  The stabilization could be improved.  I personally don't believe high ISO is a reason for cameras to be considered having dual image stabilization.  The ultra high ISO can be helpful, but it certainly does not add to image quality.  EXR mode and ADVANCED mode offer some quite helpful options when in low light conditions, especially the fact that the camera will take multiple images and combine into a final product.  Most of the time the final product is adequate to good enough for me.  I would not not enlarge them, but as a 4x6 image they are just fine.  I have been able to take surprisingly adequate images in parking lots when the only lighting is coming from a nearby lamp or in our backyard and the only light is from other homes and the moon.  With flash they are even better.  The 30x zoom is so-so.  I like the option and have taken some high quality images with it, but it is easier to have loss of clarity when at 30x.  Two nice options are the easy manual change in ISO level when taking images and tracking focus when taking images of moving objects.  The camera is worth a try.  As with all cameras, it depends on what you are looking for and how you want to use the images.  This camera can take some high quality, clear, and vivid images, but it takes time to experiment and learn which functions work best for you.  On a side note, the 360 panaroma is a fun option.  I would advise anyone getting this camera to use a class 10 sdhc card.  The average write time for a jpg photo is approximately 1.5 seconds (sometimes 1 second) on class 10 depending on the camera setting.  The write time for RAW images is a tad longer.  I can imagine it is much slower on a lower class card.A late addition (4/12):  I would also recommend rechargable NIMH batteries with the highest MAH rating you can find as possible.  The EXR and ADVANCED settings tend to use more battery because of their features.  But with having a few extra sets of recharables around and a 15 minute recharger, the amount of batter life used by the HS20 is not a problem for us.  If you only use EXR/ADVANCED settings, then your battery life will be lessened.I have been reading people's reviews of overheating and poor video quality.  The video qaulity isn't too bad, but it needs to refocus too often so video quality is lost. However, we own a video camera for this purpose.  If you want a camera with video option because you plan on recording videos, then pick a different camera.  If you don't care much for video, then don't worry.  As for overheating, I only found this to happen after an hour and a half of the camera being on and taking over 100 pictures (mix between EXR, ADVANCED, AUTO, SP1/SP2).  I have yet to work out a general time on each setting before it overheats and how many pictures I can get it.  I do like the overheating warning because it gives an idea of when the camera is being maxed on temp.  Something many other cameras don't have and may explain loss of image quality/etc in other digital cameras.  Since the EXR draws more energy, its heat output will be greater-thus causing a need for more frequent cool-down time.  Either this is a firmware issue or just something with the EXR hardware.  It will be interesting to see what the first firmware update from Fuji will be.I have found the manual zoom ring to be extremely beneficial.  If you like manual zoom, it works well.  However, I had one issue when switching to manual zoom-the entire camera froze and no buttons would respond.  Not even the on and off button.  I needed to remove the batteries to resolve the issue.  I reported this to fujifilm and they are looking into it.I still believe the camera has many positive aspects and the negative dynamics, for me, don't overpower the pluses.

In respect to the complete \"all in one\" package that it offers in extreme features what could only be gotten from equipment with the highest cost. To get even close to the equivalent package of features and abilities in a DSLR could run you $1000's of dollars more and be far heavier and inconvenient to top that all off.While there isn't very much you can't do with this amazingly versatile piece of photography equipment, there are heaps of features and offerings from this company and camera that simply can't be duplicated by any DSLR or Bridge (Super Zoom) on the market at any price. The EXR processor alone is a monumental achievement in bringing HDR photography and high iso low light performance to an affordable camera in a way no other manufacturer has ever brought forth. EXR is Revolutionary in how it combines two 8 megapixel images from the same shot by simply reprocessing it with different settings. The results are staggering in contrast depth and level of brightness, along with very low noise. Even in the darkest conditions shots are clean and the HDR level is a very high 1,600%. Higher than any other consumer camera can produce in a single shot and the object of HDR in two or more shots is achieved in just one. This camera therefore truly brings true on camera HDR in one shot like no other camera before it!This camera feels great in the hands mimicking the DSLR styling found only in high dollar equipment many times it's price. Very hansome device with a sense of quality felt better in the hand than even entry level DSLR's. It's diverse flexibility in manual settings offers the best performance per dollar spent on the Super Zoom (Bridge) market. While the Nikon's, Canon's, Panasonic's Bridge Camera offering are still in the dark ages without even close to the features this camera offers. Menus are simple and easy to understand and control. The firmware that comes on this camera is where Fuji decided to change the playing field and step out of \"All So Ran\" Bridge Camera offerings out there today. No other manufacturer has pushed the limits of compact super zooms to this extent. Not even by offering higher zoom rates on Bridge Class cameras that still don't have near the features and quality built into this camera.It'a a solid attempt to bridge the gap and at least allow photography results on lower priced equipment to excel and surpass in some instances that of higher priced DSLR! This camera making taking pictures fun again and at the same time makes you feel like a professional with a tool even a Pro would have trouble keeping up with.

I am glad that I chose this model, instead of steering away from the fuji brand because of the S4000. The HS20EXR is worlds above the S4000 when it comes to features and tricks up it's sleeve. The autofocus is super fast and usually (99 percent of the time) accurate. But, if something goes wrong; just use the manual focus. This camera does many things. Too many to explain here. But believe me, this is a great camera.The S4000 is not bad either. My S4000 arrived with a dented in corner on its' box. This makes me think that it may have been jarred or dropped at some time and knocked out of adjustment.One last item:The HS20EXR doesn't overheat with the 1.03 firmwareinstalled (which mine already had). There is only one slight problem with the autofocus. When making movies, the autofocus will only function correctly when the zoom is not used at all, or used only moderately. Otherwise, at a very high zoom (500MM and over), the autofocus just hunts constantly. This is no big deal, as all one has to do is limit the amount of zoom when making movies. This applies only to movies. When making still pictures the autofocus is excellent!Added 11-12-2011: Sanyo eneloop AA batteries are really good in this camera. A freshly recharged set will last much longer than anyone would think.Added Dec. 2012: I have purchased a HS25EXR and used it for the past several months. I now have to say that the HS25 is a big improvement over the HS20. The main problem appears to be the firmware installed in the two cameras. The HS20 was likely rushed into production before it was actually ready. The performance of the firmware shows it. The HS25 has a much better version of firmware installed in it. There is quite a lot of improvement in the HS25EXR compared to the older HS20EXR.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Third one's been excellent.", "Author": "A.

So far, so good. Then I tried to turn it OFF. It would not turn off. Had to remove the batteries to shut it down. It went back immediately. Amazon's return policy is amazing - turnaround time was incredibly fast. The second one came and it worked great for one week - then \"lens control error\" and the zoom quit working. IT went back - with the same stellar customer service, I had the third replacement inside of a week and this one has been flawless. It's the 1B serial and it has not had any overheating issues, the zoom is smooth and there are no mechanical issues whatsoever. I've taken several thousand shots with this unit thus far with no problems.Image quality is excellent for the type of camera that it is (small-sensor); color reproduction is very good albeit there are some issues with bright reds (as there is with many other cameras). It's surprisingly quite good with noise up to ISO 800 and the lens is sharp throughout most of its range. This camera is very subject to lens flare - a lens hood (included) is somewhat of a help but will not eliminate it entirely if shooting into the sun at all. Time to write to the card is decent in .jpg with a Class 10 SDHC card - abysmal in RAW no matter what card. The included software is adequate, though I prefer Adobe Lightroom for any adjustments. It's a sturdy, fairly large camera, rivaling some small DSLRs in weight and overall size. The 30x zoom is slightly soft at its outer reach and image stabilization is decent but not great; overall, though, it's a very good camera for its price range and I take it with me everywhere - just fits in my purse :)I've posted several image from this camera in the customer's images for this model. The .jpeg engine in this camera's firmware is very good - it captures a pretty good range of tones with a fair bit of latitude at each end. There is some more detail and range to be squeezed out of its RAW images (especially in the bright areas), but the slow write time makes that mode awkward and frustrating to use. While this camera does have a manual focus mode, it's quite cumbersome so I stick with the half-press autofocus method. Generally, focusing is very good - it tends to hunt a little on complex subjects but is usually pretty accurate in center/spot focus mode.It is NOT a very good low-light camera - that long lens assembly cuts down on quite a bit of light entering the camera so one must use the flash indoors or else be prepared to start with at least ISO 400 to get anything decent.

I was looking for a way in - to learn the manual functions and grow as an amateur photographer. After reading many, many official reviews/personal reviews/blogs and viewing pictures taken with the HS20 (also with budget in mind) I plumped for this camera. Ignoring some of the advice of DSLR and SLR camera owners (as I believe that their expectations may be too high when comparing like for like).AND 3 DAYS IN I MUST SAY I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED!!Firstly, let me start with the many auto functions (EXR being the highlight). These are superb (as I must admit I come from a compact, point and shoot type of lazy photograher). There are many more auto functions than I have ever had on any subsequent camera that I have owned - and 3 days into owning this camera - there seems to be a mode to suit most situations. However........This is not why I purchased this camera - it was to learn more about photography. And boy does this camera allow you to do that. Within the 3 days (and nights) I have learned what ISO means and what shutter speed means (and what the changes to these settings can do). I did tell you I was a point and shoot novice photographer.This camera has opened up an exciting new world of photography that I have never seen before. On my first night I successully took shots of the moon at 30x zoom - and the results were/are astonishing! Admittedly I did buy a cheap tripod along with the camera (which is needed at full zoom due to stability), but I can see the crescent moon in stunning detail - craters and all. I tried the auto controls to begin with, without success. A quick google search and - Hey Presto! I found the manual settings I needed (100 ISO and 1/80 shutter speed seemed to work best for me). I didn't know what this even meant 3 days ago - or even when I took the moon pictures - but I do now.Sorry for my rambling - I am a bit excited. There seems to be a curve of learning with this camera - and I am at the bottom arc of that curve - but willing to learn. This camera is ideal for me - in that I can get great auto shots for quick snapping and learn how to compose more professional looking shots. DSLR is not for me yet, but this could be that BRIDGE that I needed.So far (early days I know) this camera does everything I wanted and more - but still allowing great shots in the auto modes.

It's ability to shoot in low light conditions both in and outside is truly amazing.

I agree with the comment about slow processing speed. At first it did take a long time to process each pic and I hated that!!!  But I just couldn't believe that a camera with this pedigree would be so slow. So I decided to read the manual again,... right. Unchecked some features I didn't want activated and wow, speed  dramatically increased.  So if your speed seems slow, unselect extra features for a better performance balance & speed faster than most.Another tip:  when on auto focus it would often be constantly searching the full rack trying to lock on a focus point but never really getting it. With this monster zoom full lock to lock searching takes a while to complete a cycle. So when taking a quick shot the last thing I wanted was my autofocus kicking into that long focusing cycle. The shot would be gone before it settled into focus.  Once again, I read the manual, changed one focusing option & now my auto focus snaps into focus right away & no excessive auto focus searching.  I almost sent the camera back because of the constant searching until I realized this camera has the flex to handle any situation & it was ME that needed to get a little smarter.Like I say, this camera has a lot of flexibility built into its skin.

I have taken well over 5000 photographs with it.  About a year after I got it it died and Fuji was excellent at making it right.  Since that time it has worked well.  I take a lot of macro shots, which leads me to my main criticism of the camera...  Taking macro shots it is often difficult to get the auto focus to focus on the item I'm trying to photograph. The system often picks up the background instead of the foreground.  The manual focus feature has been tricky to master.  As soon as you attempt to focus manually, it automatically jumps to a X10 magnification to aid in critical focus.  Since it is motorized there is some lag and overshoot.  Makes taking pictures of nervous bugs kind of tricky.  I am no camera engineer, but I wish it was a truly direct manual focus.  The Zoom is manual and works flawlessly.  All of the many other features I have tried function as advertised.  The panorama feature is fun, the various movie modes are fun as well.  The slo-mo is fun to experiment with, but to keep data rates low the picture quality suffers.  I have largish hands and it fits comfortably.  The tilting LCD display is convenient especially when taking photos down near the ground or from a vantage above my head.  Within its range the flash works well, controlling exposure automatically.  Since it is a small \"built in\" there is a harshness that would not be evident with a larger, remote flash appliance.  The OEM remote exposure button is only about 18 inches.  18 feet would have been better.  This camera has RAW file capability, and .jpg.  You can set it for either or both.  The files are labelled \".RAF\", and this is not the most common format in the world so some image processing software will require a \"plugin\" to get it to handle these files.  I have programmed the \"C\" setting for the lowest ISO (100) and get excellent results so far as resolution goes provided there is enough light.  The viewfinder can be easily adjusted to the diopter of your eyeglasses.  The unit senses when something (your face) is nearby and automatically switches to viewfinder mode (Turning off the LCD) At first this was an annoyance because a loose camera strap or a flap of jacket material could trigger it.  That feature can be disabled in the menus, but now that I realize what is happening I leave it on and like it.  Originally, there was some difficulty getting dark rich purple colors (like some larkspur flowers) to render accurately.  (They came out as navy blue) but a firmware tweak from Fuji took care of that.  Since then color rendering is pretty accurate.  I get a lot of exposures on a set of 4 AA cells.  I like that I can get batteries for it in any \"backwoods general store or Quickie Mart, and don't have to use some expensive proprietary difficult to find power cell.  It can use rechargeable AAs as well.  Uses a commonly available SSD memory card.  A 32 Gigabyte chip allows over 1000 exposures even with both .jpg and RAW set.Pros;  Comfortable camera to use.  Easy to learn, RAW capability, Powerful zoom, built in panorama, movie, macro, super-macro and special modes give a LOT of versatility.  Uses commonly available batteries.  Picture quality is good.  The 30X zoom is about as much as you can practically use without a tripod.Cons;  Controlling what camera chooses to focus on when shooting very close is tricky.  Manual focus less than perfect.  The viewfinder port should have a clear lens/cover over it.  Hard to clean out dust that gets down in there.Wish list.  Longer remote exposure cable.

My previous camera was also a FujiFilm S7000 which I purchase for $420 in 2005.  I took 14000 photos with the S7000 and learned to use all of its features.If you are familar with Fujifilm operating system, you are going to love this camera.  Since 2005 little has changed. More features and more menus, but intuition that you have been taught is similar. I have not looked at the manual closely and have been able to navigate my way to outstanding photos.  Thanks to the greatest feature of digital photography, auto bracketing.In broken desert skies I shot snow covered mountains, bright moss covered rocks, red slickrock, the moon, and a rainbow.  I put the HS20 on (S)hutter and selected auto-bracketing 1/3 steps and shot away. Of the 140 photos I took the first day I was happy with about 14.\"Happy\" is subjective word, meaning proud to share with others in this case.  When you consider that 99 of the photos were auto-bracketed burst (meaning 66 were either over or underexposed) 14/33 frames is 42% acceptance rate,outstanding for any shooting day.  When we left to head out to test I was disappointed with rain and clouds everywhere and it turned out to be great day to try the HS 20.The HS 20 (SP 1) Mode (Landscape) took a couple of fine pictures.  The \"dog\" mode worked okay but often mistook boulders for my Labrador. The biggest problem I have observed with the \"auto\" features is that they want to push the ISO upwards.  In full desert sun I need to shoot at ISO 100 and 200.I like to display shots on my plasma so the 16 by 9 resolution saves me a ton of hassle. Popping the SD card in the TV is easier than firing up the desktop, especially if you are sharing with a group.Love the EVF I have always used them to save battery. The AA Ni-MH are great option.Manual zoom is outstanding, makes you think more about compostion before just zoom shoot, zoom, shoot. Many of my \"waste\" shots were Zoom, Shoot, Zoom. I was able to easily zoom in on automobiles .5 miles away and tell Make, Model, and number of occupants.Next week: Night shots, indoor shots, astronomy, X-mas lights. EXR shots at X mas parties and events.Note on Video:  I will let my daughter test and review the video options as she has more experience with using a point and shoot as a video camera.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "EXPECTED THE EXPECTATION!!!...ON FUJIFILM", "Author": "Jeffery B.

I have only had this camera for a few days, and in general I really like it. I used to shoot film SLR's semi-professionally, but this is my first experience with a glorified point & shoot. The build quality is high (except for plastic-threaded tripod mount - come on, Fuji!); it is a nice, substantial camera and feels natural in your hands. The dials and buttons are well-laid out and accessible. I have not tried the video function yet, so I can't comment on that.Overall I am happy with the image quality at wide to mid-zoom. Clarity is high and colour reproduction is quite accurate. I was shooting mostly in EXR mode, and sometimes in Auto and P mode. The 24mm wide setting distorts faces if you shoot closely, so don't photograph your kids up close unless you want them to look like they have enormous shnozzes or an immense brain in a swollen head!My main problem with this camera is when I shoot at mid to long zoom. I can get some crisp shots of my subject, with the background and foreground nicely out of focus, but the out of focus areas look highly digitized, almost like an impressionistic painting - not just simply a blurry, out of focus background and foreground. I found it to be extremely distracting and \"cheap\"-looking, as if I were shooting with a low-res camera that was interpolating the background. This is a huge issue with me because much of the photography I want to do is at the mid to long telephoto range. If anyone else has noticed this and found a way to avoid it, please let me know.

The images are not DSLR quality by any means, but for the price, portability and flexibility, it offers good value for money and seems to be the best of the superzooms.ZOOMThe zoom is incredible - I realise that for blowing up wildlife shots this is in many ways a better option than a DSLR with a 300mm lens because the magnification is optical in-camera rather than cropping (digital) post-shooting. One niggle - the zoom casing feels plasticky and the zoom is not smooth (though this avoids lens creep).EVF/SCREENFirstly, the screen is amazing - pictures jump out and you and the flexibility of the hinge is great, with a premium build quality to it. It's unfortunate that you can't twist it to view from in front of the camera for self-portraits; also the aspect ratio is 4:3, which is an odd choice as it leaves black bars top and bottom when shooting both video and stills (who shoots 4:3 stills???). However, these are minor niggles.The EVF is tiny and you really need to squint to see through it - it's not really possible to adjust focus using it, but it can be useful when shooting in bright locations. It does provide a good amount of information in the view, though.The worst thing about the EVF and Screen (coming from a DSLR world) is that the '50fps' quoted as the live view playback is actually more like 10-15fps in anything other than good lighting, or even in good lighting at the long end of the zoom range. This is not a problem with the camera, it's just something that DSLR users will need to know as it can make composing and focusing difficult.FOCUSComing from DSLR land, I use my manual focus A LOT; often in wildlife shots or low light, the camera will not pick up the subject, so you'll need to do a bit of manual tweaking. This camera DOES NOT offer true manual focus; what it offers is a sort of hybrid manual/autofocus, where you can move the focus ring to specify which rough area of the depth of field you want to focus on and then the camera autofocuses on what it thinks you want within that region. This can be very confusing at first, but actually often ends up useful as (as I have mentioned) focusing precisely using the screen and EVF can often be difficult and the results are usually accurate. I just wish there was also a 'true MF' mode as using this can often be counterintuitive at best and frustrating at worst; I have missed many shots due to the slow nature of this process.The absolute worst thing about this camera is that the picture freezes while the camera focuses - why in God's name is this?? It means that when you're focussing in AF on a moving subject you have to estimate its movement while taking the shot. It's as if at the crucial moment just as you begin to press down on the shutter to take a photo, someone turns off the lights.I don't want to give an overall bad impression - these are just two things after all. The focus in general is pretty good, if laggy.EXRThis brilliant mode allows you to sacrifice resolution in order to improve your camera's sensitivity. There are ISO, Dynamic Range and Sharpness modes to choose from; the ones I use most are the Sharpness, which does hugely improve the clarity of your photos, and ISO, which boosts your camera's sensitivity in low light and is great (and necessary) when using the long end of the zoom range.OTHER FEATURES OF NOTE...Panorama produces beautifully stitched panoramas of up to 360 degrees, which often come out looking flawless and is very easy to use and quick too, with barely any processing lag post-shooting.Video is passable - the effect of the image stabiliser makes it slightly nausea-inducing to watch, although it's crisp and good when added on to the camera's already vast list of features. It is, however, annoying that the camera only focuses once - right at the start, and often focuses incorrectly.There is a great low light feature in the Advanced mode, which takes three photos consecutively and stitches them to reduce noise. This works incredibly well and I got some nice shots handheld using the zoom after dark, which stunned me.BUILD QUALITYThe camera is weighty - about 2/3rds of my DSLR's weight with its 300mm lens attached! BUT for that you get a camera with macro (quite good) tele (good) and wide-medium angle lens (good). I think the tradeoff is good and the weight makes it easier to keep steady, but is not so much that cycling with it is a chore. The metal dials are a nice touch, the flash is solid and the only part of the camera that feels cheap is the lens case (although the lens itself is great). The camera takes AA batteries, which, depending on your POV is either brilliant, or a pain; I prefer proprietary batteries for their reduced size and ease of charging, but the battery life is superb (I take LOTS of stills and video and could go out for three consecutive days without recharging, even using the big back screen). The hotshoe above the flash is a nice touch, though it's really overkill for this camera. There are LOADS of buttons all over the place, but I found their layout quite intuitive and I love this as it avoids having to dig into menus all the time.OVERALLA well-built camera with good image quality and an incredible zoom range. Serious issues with focusing still don't ruin my enjoyment of a very portable, flexible and feature-packed piece of kit. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to downgrade from DSLRs or upgrade from compact cameras, though realistically it won't provide the image quality of the former or the portability of the latter. This has restored my faith in superzooms as a viable category; and is a more realistic option than a micro two-thirds camera with a hideously expensive detachable zoom lens.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best bridge camera I've seen so far", "Author": "E.

The HDR mode doesn't seem as good as I hoped it would be. My IPhone remains the HDR King by taking two pictures and combining them.

I have no regret purchasing this and will not return it so far.Physically, it is handy. Not very big and not weigh too much even with four AA batteries. The grip is covering all right hand so I won't need a strap in most situations.For the image quality, it is not so satisfying. However, it provides you different solutions to approach better image quality.Firstly, EXR Auto Mode is good enough to produce photos compared to my G11. Adv mode is a surprise to me. it blurs the surroundings and highlight the center focused stuff and shows clearer details than other modes. Panorama mode is good. This feature is the key reason I want to buy it.Secondly, I guess the philosophy of Fujifilm on this model is:\"you try more and pick the best\". It has a function that can automatically choose the best shoot in a bkt of continues photos. I think it fits me because I can dive in a lot of options and switch quickly. So on the other hand, if you need an express way to shoot and don't like to configure a lot, HS20EXR is not good enough for you. I would rather recommend Canon Cameras to have better interactive experience.It's not easy for me to say what's not good enough for this camera. The only thing I am not satisfied is the focus at the long end, and the noise comming out of the camera. when you focus on an object at 30X, this camera usually don't focus well enough and when you half press the shutter it will keep noising, like IS is constantly working. If I put it on the table to focus, the noise disappeared. Perhaps it is IS which is working on such a small object. Other thing is, the Flash light is not good enough since it has a long lense, which will have an obvious shadow on the picture when you shoot close pictures.Overall, HS20EXR has a versatile capability for middle experienced photographers. It's a better camera to my G11, but must make mistake in front of DSLR. It is cheaper than HS10 on Amazon.

The graphics are not very good and you have to enter the ENTIRE menu system to change the settings (ISO, white balance, exposure, etc). As the panasonic does have the \"quick menu\" (love this feature <- have had panasonics in the past), the HS20 does have ISO, exposure, white balance and focus buttons on the side.

I've found that zooming during video = useless. After zoomed in during video (if close to subject) = useless. All in all, the best video this camera can take is from 3x down to zero zoom.

It seemed to be 80% focused. ALTHOUGH this was at night, only by a lamps light. = I will take video during day light, outside, and repost.Furthermore, I've taken a few pictures with the SUPER macro and was impressed with the fact that the camera DID focus on the subject at extreme close-ups.

After buying it, I can confirm that most of the reports I read from other users (not necessarily on Amazon) are nonsense.The Pros:The pics are sharp and clear.The automatic mode is awesome which allows other people to use it easily so I can even be in my pics sometimes.The rear viewing panel is excellent.The auto-focus is fast and accurateThe low-light capabilities rock.The Cons:I fail to understand why Fujifilm chose to go with AA batteries. Having to carry extra batteries all the time is annoying. Very annoying.The view finder is a waste of space- total junk. (see comment on the viewing panel above)The camera wakes up from sleep mode much too slowly.The Menu is not exactly intuitive and takes some getting used to.Miscellaneous:The camera does not overheat in video mode. One just needs to tell the camera what kind of batteries one is using. Clearly, whoever wrote that review failed to read the manual. Once one does get used to the menu, one can get exceptional results.Overall, I am very happy with this camera; it's my backup when I am on short trips and it does the job admirably.Here are a few sample pics:a.

I have spent over three years looking for a suitable upgrade for my 9 year old Sony V1.  After years of waiting for another compact size prosumer camera to hit the market, I finally gave up and decided I would go with a megazoom.  I am not a person that likes to buy stuff just to try it and return it. This is why I have watched the megazoom market for years waiting for the right camera to emerge.  When the HS10 was released, I immediately began watching to see if it was the one.  There was somethings I did not like about it, but I figured it was the best I could do.  I was just about to order it when I heard the HS20 was coming out. The HS20 promised to fix all the things that were lacking in the HS10 and so I took the leap and pre-ordered it (something I have never done before).  I waited with baited breath for it to arrive and could not wait to start taking photos with it.  Then it came.  That is when the trouble started. I will not do the pros and cons thing because if a camera does not take good pictures, nothing else matter.My Experience.I took 500 test photos with the camera during the time I had it.  I tested it in every area I could.  I took bright light, low light, indoor, outdoor, tripod, hand held, full zoom, no zoom, macro, fast action, still shots, and video. I used full auto, EXR, and manual settings. I am sad to say that in no area did the HS20 satisfy me.  Now before you go thinking that I am one of those SLR elitist that snub their nose at anything that does not cost thousands of dollars, let me tell you that I have never owned or used an SLR camera of any kind.  I have had only three digital cameras, the Sony Mavica CD-500, the Sony DSC-V1 and the Canon SD1100IS.  These are all point and shoot cameras and none of these are considered top of the line cameras.  Now let's continue.I have never used a megazoom camera before so I cannot make a comparison to other megazooms, but I will say that the HS20 has the slowest focus time of any camera I have ever used whether shooting stills or video.  The focus is so slow it almost make the camera unusable for anything but shooting panoramas from a tripod.  One of the things that makes this camera almost impossible to use is not the slow focus, but the fact that both the screen and the viewfinder freeze when you depress the shutter button and stay frozen until the camera achieves focus, which takes over a second in most cases.  This means that if you are trying to focus on a moving subject you cannot track the subject during focus process and when the screen comes back to life the subject might be completely off the screen.  This also happens when you try to take hand held picture.  I found it impossible to take pictures in focus while holding the camera. I think Fujifilm could fix this problem by simply giving the camera manual focus capability.As far as image quality is concerned, I found the results dull and lacking in color.  The HS20 is promoted as having the best Low Light capability of any megazoom.  While this may or may not be true is yet to be proven.  What is true is that this is a tricky statement and may deceive many into believing that it has great low light performance.  The truth is that no megazoom can compete in the low light area because of the laws of physics that technology has yet to find a way to overcome.  I pitted the HS20 against my 9 year old Sony V1 in a low light shootout.  I used a single tripod with switchable plates, identical settings, shooting the in identical conditions and the V1 smashed the HS20 into oblivion.  As far as brightness, color correctness and sharpness, my canon SD1100IS smashed the HS20 all to pieces.  The was true for macro shots as well.Okay, lets talk about video.  Now many people say, \"who cares about video? This is a stills camera, not a video camera\".  To that I say, I am not the one who said this camera can take outstanding 1080P HD video, Fuiffilm did and they had better be able to back it up.  Does the HS20 live up to Fujifilms claims.  Much to the disappointment of many, that answer is an absolute NO!  The video that the HS20 produces is un-watchable.  Don't get me wrong, it has good color and clarity when it is in focus, but that is one of the problems, the camera is almost never in focus.  If this were the only problem, one could learn to live with it, but unfortunately it is not.  The slow focus problem has another side effect, the mic picks the sound of the focus motor up and you can clearly hear it in the video.  You can hear a loud grinding and clicking sound whenever the camera is focusing, which is every 2 seconds. So throughout the whole video you hear CR A A A A A CK  CR A A A A CK  CR A A  A A A CK.  It sounds something like Perry the Platypus off of the Phineas & Ferb cartoon.  But that is not all.  Each time you move the lens it sound like you are dragging your fingernails over a chalkboard.  That is not all either. If you pan while shooting video, even if you do so very slowly and smoothly, the video jumps along as if you were stringing still pictures together.  Fujifilm need to abandon video on this camera or go back to the drawing board and start from scratch.The lens itself feel really cheap, almost like a toy.  No matter how hard you try, you cannot get it to zoom smoothly. It feels like one of those toy telescope you buy at walmart for $30.Last of all, let me talk about write speeds.  To put it simple.  My 9 year Sony V1 had faster write speeds then the HS20.  Don't be fooled!  This camera has an internal memory buffer that will allow you to take another picture before the first one is finished writing, but that does not mean that it has fast write speeds.  It takes over a second to write a jpg image.  You can try to take another picture while it is writing, but since it takes over a second for the camera to acquire a focus the first picture was long ago writing before you take the second picture.  4 seconds apart was about as fast as I could manually take pictures with out using burst mode. I can take highest quality jpgs with my V1 at about 1.5 seconds apart.The camera itself is pretty big and heavy.  The strap will hurt you neck after a short while and you will have to keep switching hands as your arms get tired. There are a lot of external control close to the grip and if you have big hands like me you will find yourself accidentally pushing them, especially if you hold it with just your right hand.Word of warning!  Fujifilm has a lot of fans that dominate the camera forums and defend fujifilm cameras with religious zeal.  It is hard to find an objective opinion of the forums because of this.  They will always try to make it seem that it is the fault of the user not the camera.  Don't be fooled like I was.  I have learned my lesson the hard way.

I decided to upgrade from my 7 megapixel Fuji S700 and buy this big guy. Well I must say, I'm pretty happy! I take product pictures for my online business, and have had a heck of a time taking pictures in low light with my S700. The EXR function on the HS20 camera is pretty decent. It won't work miracles (I use two 100 watt hardware lights) but it definitely takes much crisper photos than my previous cameras. Another fun feature is the panorama! I really like how the camera animates the panorama photo (this would be great for showing off real estate images...) It feels like this camera has a million features and I still haven't even tried half of them out. Just a great deal for the price.The manual zoom is a bit tricky...I've been playing around with it for the last couple of days and probably just need some personal practice. I like this camera compared to regular DSLRs because you have manual controls while also maintaining the automatic controls. Great for someone who has some experience in photography but is not quite a professional. I mainly needed this camera for it's low-light performance, and so far I'm pleased. I have not messed with the video, simply because I'm not very interested in it. I've heard there have been some complaints about that, but if you're not looking to make a lot of pro movies, then this camera's still pretty great. My only real complaint is probably the flash control. You have to push a button to pop up the flash AND THEN the flash buttons on the control buttons. This can take a little while to get used to, as I was used to simply pressing \"Macro\" or \"Force flash\" and instantaneously switching flash functions. Not a huge biggie. I really like the size as it fits nice in my hand without being too heavy. Not the best for traveling, but not a complete burden. I love all the extra lenses and accessories you can purchase with this camera as well. I'm looking at purchasing a fisheye lens in the future.Overall, this camera is great for the amateur photographer who is looking for something a little advanced, but not scary!

The camera certainly gives image quality better than I expected for its price range. It has been particulary useful to me, because I do indulge in some nature photography. Birds that are 20 to 30 yards away can be captured \"up close\". Even without a tripod, I managed to get reasonably sharp images using the mid zoom range. In such situations, using the rather basic digital viewfinder helps me to steady the camera against my face. The camera is well furnished with buttons that mimic the more professional DSLR cameras. But so far, I have mostly stuck to the Auto EXR modes as I am still on the learning curve. I have yet to explore its potential for manual photograhy in PASM modes nor have I tried out continous tracking focus for multiple photo shoots in action scenes. To my eyes, video was adequate with good color rendering. I did not experience some of the focus issues reported. But I did notice an orb issue when I shot into the setting sun on one occasion. Batteries do not last as much as promised. So keep a extra set always. I recommend that you invest in the charger and Ni-Cd rechargable batteries.The camera is definitely much bigger than your ordinary point and shoot and somewhat heavy.

We shopped around for months reading reviews and comparing features before finally choose the HS20.  We are very impressed with our choice and have recommended it to others.This bridge camera offers many features over a point and shoot.  The big 2 are the long zoom lens and the ability to change settings to alter the effect on shots.  Other features include an improved sensor(CMOS) which allows for much nicer photos, a flash shoe, viewfinder, and a moveable preview screen.My favorite feature is the lens.  The 30x zoom is awesome when you think of how many lenses you would need to carry with a comparable SLR to go from Macro shots to 30x and everything in between.  We recently went to Key west and were able to take shots of everything w/o having to worry about being close or further away.Compared to a point and shoot you have much more control over adjusting your pictures through the settings on the camera.  You have all the settings a SLR has without the bulk and expense.  You can change the light settings by adjusting the shutter and aperture manually or choose from many of the built in presets.  The camera also takes great panoramic pictures by simply rotating in a circle, which most SLR's can not without the use of a computer.There is nothing we really dislike on the camera, but there are some things that may not be suitable for everyone.  The first is the size.  This is by no means a camera that will fit in your pocket.  You could probably fit it in most purses, but regardless it is not a very portable camera.  The next is a lack of a digital zoom.  Some people may prefer to have this feature built in, but it is not found on this camera.  The optical zoom should be sufficient for most shots, but if you need closer pictures beyond that you can crop pictures to get a closer look since you have 16mp to work with.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "poor dust resistance", "Author": "Daniel Night \"Do to others as you would have ...", "ReviewID": "R1TMJ0SI7JCF3F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Mine collected dust under the lens in under a month, A LOT of dust.

Highly recommend.Enormous zoom and very good stabilization. EXR-auto works very good. No problems with overheating. It is a 5+ star camera if not for the batteries. Amazingly for such a good camera, the NiMH batteries are not performing! Camera with fresh eneloops and NiMH settings works very slow, showed \"low battery\" and shut off just after about 30 shots with flash and screen at 75%! To cure the problem I now use combinations of 3 eneloops and one NiZn (1.6V) or 3 eneloops and 1 Lithium (1.5V). Either of these combinations makes the camera \"normally\" fast and lasting! Recently, while on a trip to Paris for seven days, the NiZn combination gave me more than 500 shots on a charge, many with the flash and EXR, while used only 900-1100 mAh of capacity (be careful, NiZn AA have only 1200mAh on average; it is easy to over-discharge and \"kill\" them in the combination since the eneloops are ~2000mAh). One Lithium battery lasted in combination more than 2 changes of the eneloops, each time at ~1000mAh discharge (be careful not to \"kill\" the eneloops in this case!).Four lithium batteries would be perfect (with the Li settings), they keep the voltage practically to the end under 500mA load and they have [practically] twice the capacity of eneloops - 2900mAh, but they are too expensive, ~$9/set of 4!So, NiMH batteries are supposed to be the choice for this camera, but they just do not perform in this camera!

However I'm afraid this review is going to sound like a gushing testimonial to the engineers at Fujifilm for designing a camera like the HS20. I'm am amateur photographer whose previous cameras have all been digital point and shoot. I was considering a DSLR, but being lazy I didn't want to deal with aperture settings and things of that nature. However when I looked at the HS20 I saw the best of both worlds; a digital point and shoot with all the features of DSLR. The picture clarity is incredible in both the still and video modes. Upon reading earlier reviews, there were reports of the HS20 overheating, I've had this camera for two months and used it fairly often and I've yet to experience any problems whatsoever. With a retail price between $400 and $600, this camera is a bit on the pricey side, but trust me it is worth every penny!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far so good.

I was worried about the heat message that people have been getting.  I used it all day and did not get a heat issue until I put it into full HD video and recorded for about 3 or 4 minutes.  I then went to the Fuji website they had firmware version 1.02 now for the HS20 and it fixes the heat warning message.  After installing the new firmware I put the camera down on the table and turned on the video and it took a 30 minute clip with no heat warning.  The firmware seems to have fixed the problem and I can't duplicate it anymore.  So far this camera is taking great photos and the bad ones are mostly due to operator error.  I do notice that in low light it is a bit harder for the camera to auto focus but in normal daylight it has very fast auto focus.  The video is good except that it does take a while for the focus to adjust and I would think that they could fix it with another firmware upgrade.  The video does not concern me much because I wanted this camera more for photos.  The 360 degree panorama works great and it stiches the photos very well. I think I will try some filters for this camera like a polarized filter an maybe a ND filter.  This camera works good and it is nice to have one that does not beep at you for leaving the lens cap on.  It will take me some time to learn all of the features and when they work best.

After 4 years of heavy use it paid for itself and it was time to lay it to rest. I'm an Architect so I'm no \"pro photographer\" but I do have an eye for details. I was looking for a high-end point-and-shoot that would out perform my old camera and bring some modernization into my pictures.I spent a couple or weeks researching and read a lot of reviews about this camera, which are very mixed. On paper, the HS20 EXR is a great deal for the price. I figured a lot of the negative reviews were probably from people who were comparing this camera to much more expensive dSLR cameras and this was reinforced by the positive reviews I read. Ultimately, I bought the HS20 because I felt it had a great price-to-feature ratio, the best sensor for the price and a wide range of zoom.I got the camera a right away I was unsure about how I felt about it. I started playing around with it and took a great deal of pictures. The \"large\" 1/2\" sensor does take some great pictures and really fantastic Macro shots. The easy panorama mode is awesome, the flash is very good, menus are okay, the tilting LCD screen looked good... I thought maybe this was a great camera after all. So I started to get into the camera a bit more and took it to a family Christmas party to give it a proper test shoot.I took about 150 pictures and maybe 30minutes of videos. That's when this camera REALLY started to let me down. The manual zoom is jerky at best, after a while the added weight of this camera starts to get real cumbersome and it has the WORST AUTO FOCUS EVER!! I missed a ton of great picture opportunities because the camera was \"hunting\" for the focus. Once I downloaded the pictures to my laptop I realized I had to throw away a great deal of pictures because they had come out blurry. The video was horrible, it was like putting on a pair of \"drunk glasses\" everything was out of focus, eventually it locks on but the second you move or zoom out its back to drunk mode.I had been impressed by the quality of the earlier pictures I had taken, which were in the bright outdoors vs dark indoors where the party was. I tried every mode and setting possible but getting a reliably good picture just wasn't happening.I finally gave up on the HS20 and traded it for a Nikon S9100. The HS20 was really a disappointment, it was capable of taking some terrific pictures... when they were in focus. Losing nearly a third of my shots to poor focus broke the deal for me. It takes good pictures but I need to be able to RELIABLY take good pictures. Its not worth hauling around nearly 30 ounces of camera to not be sure whether or not it'll take a good picture. Maybe it takes someone who knows more about photography than I do to get the most out of the camera.In any case, I would not recommend this camera unless all you'll be taking pictures of is fruit in a basket....", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "very nice camera", "Author": "a-dub-ya", "ReviewID": "RUTKCTLYDJWCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent camera for the price, its a great choice if you dont want to deal with the complexity of digital SLR yet you want some of the more advanced features.

But to get the best pictures you need to master the options. It took me a few days of experimenting with settings and taking 50 - 100 pictures a day before I was truly pleased with the results. For example, my first batch of outdoor shots had a bit more noise in them than I like. Turns out the camera had automatically switched to ASA800 equivalent in order to shoot at a high enough shutter speed to keep the telephoto shot crisp. But I am very good at holding a camera steady for telephoto shots, so I don't need the high shutter speed the camera thinks I need. Once I figured out how to limit ASA to 100, then those same shots came out great! There are so many settings and so many features you really need to give yourself time to experiment in order to master the camera, no matter how 'experienced' you are. I bought my first SLR in 1972 - a Honeywell Pentax - and this HS20 has become my favorite camera I have owned. With correct settings this camera will take publication quality photos in almost all the situations that an SLR will.A perfect balance of size + capability + performance + cost in my opinion. When I go sea kayaking the camera is between my legs so I can get some great wildlife pics. My friends are still fiddling with their dry bags to get at their SLR camera long after the scene is gone.

Even though the camera is brand new there is already and update. (Kind of like Microsoft Windows)I also found updates for my original cameras. Since the update I have not had the heat waring come up. I have done a couple more soccer games and my daughters college softball. I did not repeat my heat test. Overall I'm happy", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than originally thought...", "Author": "Zachary Wagner", "ReviewID": "R3NDAY74EZDEZL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted, desperately wanted, to like this camera... nay... to love it.  Coming from a dslr background, I thought I had prepared myself for the compromises inherent in a bridge superzoom such as this.  I hadn't.  Sadly, the HS20 is going back, and I knew that it was going about five minutes after it arrived.The first thing I noticed was the build quality.  This is a $500 camera.  Not a dslr, mind you, but close enough in price to one that I would expect a little more professional build.  As soon as I picked up the camera, it felt poorly assembled.  Parts felt loose, unnecessarily so, such as the battery compartment cover which slides open in a kind of hap-hazard, break-me-as-soon-as-possible kind of way.  As soon as I turned the manual zoom lens (one of my favorite features on this camera), I winced.  Not only was the zoom uneven feeling throughout the length, there was even a mildly grind-y sensation halfway to max.  Then I noticed that the lens itself seemed a bit loose on the body.  I wasn't worried about it coming off, but it moved enough that it annoyed me quite a bit.  Dslr lenses are detachable, and I've never had one this loose, or loose at all, and this lens is PERMANENTLY ATTACHED.  The power switch was kind of loose and seemed a little cheeky.  Again, didn't feel like it was coming off or anything, just didn't feel all that solid.  Weird.  But these aren't the reasons I'm returning it.The autofocus on this camera has an annoying tick that may be common to point and shoot cameras, but I've got an old Kodak Easyshare z1015 that would tell you a different story.  The story with the HS20 is this: when you press the shutter button halfway to focus, the camera pauses, leaving the unfocused frame in the LCD screen and the viewfinder (apparently while it finds the actual focus), then the in focus frame magically appears.  What does this mean in real world shooting?  It means that every time you go to take a picture of a moving subject (for me, my dogs), you'd better have a precognitive vision about the direction they're moving at the exact moment they move there, otherwise, when your 'in focus' frame pops up, your subject is no longer in it.  My z1015IS certainly has some slight pausing here and there, and it can be annoying, but it's nothing compared to the HS20.  And that camera is 2 years older!  Where's the extra processing power to make things run smoothly?  $500?  I don't think so.  To be fair, the pause on the HS20 isn't really that long either, but it's long enough to make me mad.  And my camera shouldn't make me mad.  And for a camera that's posing as a dslr in a point and shoot body, I think it's inexcusable.Now here's another question: why does a camera that boasts a reasonably high frame rate hose you by putting each successive frame you've taken in the EVF and LCD as you take them?  Why not just grab the pictures, allowing you to keep track of your subject?  What's the point if you can't do such a simple thing?  Perhaps there's some option that fixes this issue, but due to other issues, I simply don't care.  And yes, I had turned the photo review option off.  The screen might as well go blank while you're bursting.Switching to RAW mode severely impairs this camera's speed abilities.  The camera takes a picture, then takes several seconds to write the file.  Unfortunately, during this time you cannot make adjustments to the settings.  It's too bad that with all the technological advancements in photography, RAW write times are still hamstringing cameras left and right.The EVF is pretty unimpressive as well. (understandable for a less expensive camera, but again, $500?)  The G12 has an (admittedly pretty bad) optical viewfinder.  Why not utilize (a decent) one on a camera with the aspirations of this one?So why does the camera get a 3 if it annoyed me so much?  Well, the range is impressive.  As clunky as the manual zoom felt, it was nice to have, and certainly much nicer than the motorized alternative.  The macro and super macro modes are impressive.  The EXR dynamic range and SN (low light) modes are similarly impressive.  And the IQ is very good for such a small sensor camera with such a massive zoom.  I did find that close up pixel-peeping resulted in some of the watercolor effect, but not to any degree that I would call horrid, especially for what this camera is trying to be.  Jpegs come out quite decent, and that's good, cause shooting in RAW is so much slower.  The actual shot-to-shot time of the camera is really not bad at all, and in fact pretty good.  That is of course hampered by the annoying autofocus pause, however, and whether you're shooting in RAW or Jpeg and want to change settings or not.(UPDATE 1) So after discussion with someone in the HS20 forum, I've come to realize that the autofocus issue I described can be remedied by changing a simple setting, from AF multi to basically any other AF type.  Thus, I have adjusted my score for the camera up one star.  I have still returned it, and in shifting my thinking a bit, have in my possession the LX5 from Panasonic.  Hopefully the faster lens and IQ will make me happy!  I didn't have the time or energy to go back and edit this review, so sorry if you read all the way through only to have to read this at the end.  Other personal issues I mentioned still remain, which is why it didn't get a 5.(UPDATE 2) I ended up returning the LX5 due to undesirable (and strangely blotchy) noise levels as low as ISO 200.  I have now for the last week or so been using the camera I will keep: the Olympus XZ-1.  I love it, but if you want my review, head on over to the product page.  In using all these cameras for the (admittedly short) time I have, I believe my end rating for the HS20 would be 3.5 stars.  I really did not like the build quality (at least of my copy), found the RAW vs Jpeg processing too slow (and in comparison to the XZ-1, much too slow), and the images I got from that camera (at least for me) do not compare to the XZ-1.  However, that all said, I think that judging by what others have said here and by looking at the photos taken with the HS20 by some others (mainly beas62), along with my limited experience, I think this camera is certainly a capable piece of equipment for someone wanting the range it provides.  Happy shooting, folks!(UPDATE 3) It has come to my attention that few people are discussing the autofocus issue this camera has while filming video.  I personally never used the video, but am aware of the problem (wherein the camera struggles for focus, especially when zooming), and have seen quite a few videos that attest to this problem.  Perhaps it's a problem that a mere firmware update will fix, but it's worth it to note that videographers should be aware of and research this issue before buying.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!!

Mostly stills, but sometimes a little video now and then.I am not married to the idea of FinePix Cameras, yet this is my third.  I have repeatedly chose Fuji FinePix because:Up-Sides:1.  Great pictures for the price (great lens and apparently pretty good internal components).2.  Durable/Reliable (So far...but mostly based on my prior experience of dragging my cameras on hiking excursions into the wilderness).3.  Uses AA Batteries (especially important if you roam far from an electrical outlet).4.  Great Features (although kind of awkward at times).  Especially Wide to 30X Zoom, Panorama Feature (not sure how, but it seamlessly stitches the images together without any fuss), HD Video Capable, and HDMI output.5.  High resolution display is very clear and crisp.6.  Battery Life was NOT an issue.Down-Side:Big (2):1.  The unique manual zoom is not very smooth and takes some getting used to (especially if you try it while recording video without a tripod).  I really prefer the motorized zoom on my previous cameras, especially the rocker controlled zoom where the switch is adjacent to the shudder release.  Especially nice to have a motorized zoom when you are standing on a cliff or sticking your head out the car or hotel window etc.).  However, with such a huge lens, I don't imagine the batteries would last long, nor would the motors driving the lens out the full 30X length.  So manual is, well, an inconvenient compromise on my part.2.  Auto-Focus is finicky and sometimes does not behave as expected based on the subject matter of the photo.  This happens mostly on a long telephoto shots where there there are objects in the foreground (e.g. shooting a telephoto of something when shooting between trees which are much closer).  It might take a few tries to get the correct focus, but so far a good result is still possible with some effort.Other Minor stuff:3.  Non-intuitive menus take a lot of time getting used-to.4.  Basic Paper Manual Only (full manual as PDF on CD).  Would have been nice to have a paper copy to take along on the first few outings....5.  Eye sensor sometimes shuts down LCD Monitor erroneously.  From time to time I like not to look like such a tourist....even though the camera is around my neck, I like to use the fold out LCD to shoot without raising the camera to my eye.  The eye sensor sometimes turns off the LCD, when I am in the middle of framing/focusing a shot.6.  Electronic viewfinder.  It would have been nice if there were a soft cup surrounding the electronic viewfinder.7.  Monitor Durability?  I suspect that because the monitor surface is flat, having no rim or lip, I will eventually get some damage.  Screen protectors are not my forte, so I guess I will just deal with it if it happens.  No actual damage has occurred, I am just wondering how long.  My other Fuji camera monitor has held up very very well with lots of rough use, but it is non-extendable and is slightly recessed.8.  Camera overheated once.  Not sure if this will be a regular occurrence or what caused it.  I might have done something dumb like accidentally filming in full HD while the camera was in the holster, in the backpack.Summary:All and all, there is no match on the market which meets my for requirements listed above (\"up-sides\").No regrets.

I have also been informed by Fujifilm that the camera does not like certain memory cards. There is nothing in the manual stipulating a certain card to use.

I'll have the \"video out\" going to a projector while in standby and it's \"choppy\", maybe 25-30fps while I'm waiting to record...not good.The Zoom lens only requires a 1/4 turn from Macro to Tele for 700mm...you see where I'm going here? Jerky Zoom. It needs to be at least a 1/2 turn to keep it smooth.Shot to Shot times are unimpressive. Check this out...Imagine you're looking through the 3\" display and see a shot, you press the shutter release and the image FREEZES while it's focusing! If the image moved then you're out of luck! Totally worthless! I would expect this from a 10 yr old camera...not a brand new one.No A/C adapter connection.I just purchased the Lumix FZ100 and I'll let you know what I find out.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very amateur user - Got my camera yesterday", "Author": "Dana Carte \"DanaC\"", "ReviewID": "R3APXQNS9ELGWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just took a few shots around the house- don't have a tripod yet, but it's on my list..

The results were terrible with the blues especially being not only muddy and not blue, but in many shots not even recognizable as flowers. Just a field of gray with no detail. Strangely, trees in the background were sharp, but flowers right in front of them were unrecognizable. I tried numerous options, including EXR, Program and manual, and none produced a shot I would show anyone. The next day I tried it at an airshow and got even more frustrated. The camera simply is too slow to focus and too slow to save. And as mentioned in other reviews, the temperature icon was coming on constantly. It even came on when I wasn't taking any pictures. I again tried different focusing options, including the manual focus and AF lock, and none were satisfactory. The freezing of the frame when it was on autofocus was especially annoying. By the time I could see live again, I'd lost the plane. I missed a lot of shots I would have gotten even with my older Panasonic Lumix. I tried the video and it couldn't hold the focus there either. As I tracked a plane, it was constantly going in and out of focus. So in summary,Poor quality photos, too slow to focus, too slow to save a shot, temperature issues, poor video focusing.

I can now say after owning 3 DSLR's and 1 SLT, the HS10 is really the answer for those walking tours where one is limited on what he carries. The photo quality is very underrated by many reviews, to what I have experienced with this camera. In most reviews I see a bias toward only a DSLR. The Fuji HS series so far fills the gap and has become a necessary camera for many areas. From reading the early reviews on YouTube etc.I see needed improvements in the new HS20, while maintaining size and handling. I could not wait to get one ordered. B&H; shipped it same day (March 24th) and tracking shows me it will arrive in WA state on the 29th with 3 day express. From initial reports on the enhanced features, I am anticipating getting down to 2 cameras, my Sony A33 SLT with its 18-250 lens and instant focus and the new Fuji HS20 for the longer shots. Both cameras are small and light weight for the features.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4/6/11. I did not realize I gave the new camera 4 stars in my review. My intent was to inform viewers that the camera was available from B&H; Photo. I received the camera 5 days ago and have already returned it to B&H.; Out of 30 attempted photo's 2 were keepers. I do not know if it was this particular camera, but the photos taken in the EXR mode were not good. The auto focus was very slow and most of the pictures showed blur when viewed on the computer. I will keep the my prior model, the HS10 as it takes much better photos and the auto focus is much faster. Regarding B&H; photo I cannot say enough good things about this superior company.
