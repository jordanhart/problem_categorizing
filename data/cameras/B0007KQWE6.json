It has it all, including `fireworks' mode! The best are the various `tones' you can give your pictures. Just look at all the technical specifications here and you'll be amazed! I like that I can video in three different modes with great sound and that I can film in so many different modes (headshot, distance, fireworks, nightscape, backlight, etc.) that you can never screw up. Plus it is 7.0 pixels which is really incredible even when you crop half a photo! Unlike most small cameras, the buttons are easy to navigate. It also comes with all the extras you need (listed in the specifications). Don't settle for anything less than 7.0 pixels, as within a year anything 5.0 or under will be obsolete. I love this little thing and bought all the accessories it didn't come with (which were few).

It takes great pictures, when they come out. I have taken numerous pictures that have come out blurry (because of the settings it was on-- and not using a tripod). All of the settings are nice features to have, but often you can't even use them if you are lacking a tripod (pics are blurry), and thus resort to the regular setting (which still takes good pictures). My other complaint about this camera is that it eats through batteries like there is no tomorrow. If you don't use rechargeables every week, then they will be gone by the next time you turn on the camera. Further, my regular AA batteries only last about 2 days of picture taking (about 40 pictures in all).As for the pros: This camera definately takes great pictures (better than a lot of my friend's camers) the majority of the time, which have all been crisp and clear. I have used 80% of the different settings, and they all work pretty well (minus night settings because of no tripod). I would highly recommend this camera, but caution about the ongoing cost of AA batteries.As with any camera, there are lots of pros, with just a few annoying cons that may greatly impact your decision, if they are important to you.I hope this helps.", "Date": "November 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "My first digital camera and I am pleased....", "Author": "RPK \"Professional Shark Tamer\"", "ReviewID": "R2GSPAFDNIE167", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first digital camera I have owned and I have been very pleased with it so far. I was recommended this camera after my cousin purchased it and fell in love with it. I saw it online for a very reasonable price and decided to buy it. As a beginner to cameras I have found this compact little Nikon super easy to use. It is pretty much self explanatory once you start to play around with the buttons. 7 Megapixels really make the picture quality BEAUTIFUL and I have already gotten compliments on some images I have taken. I would honestly say the only negative thing I can say about this camera is that it DOES take a while when you are using a flash. This camera takes awesome still photos of people in any type of lighting, but I can say that night-time action shots can cause some trouble. I took action shots of my dogs using sports mode and they came out amazing. I posted them in the sample photo section of this page. I am going to try and figure out how to get the camera to take better action shots at night, but other than that I am pleased with this tiny little 7MP camera. It is a great deal for a camera with such a sharp image quality! I would say this camera may night be the best choice for people who want to take a ton of night-time action images though, so keep that in mind. Also, I am not too fond of the battery situation. I wish there was some sort of recharging dock for this camera so i didn't have to recharge the batteries every time I use it.", "Date": "February 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Waste of Money if Your Subjects Move", "Author": "TX mom of 2 \"teacher mom\"", "ReviewID": "RJDX0TDKFBOJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Before I bought, I read these reviews. Lots of peopls like this camera. Some said it's great when you learn the shooting modes and scenes. A few say it takes very blurry pictures. I figured those people just hadn't mastered the features, and that it would be fine. It seemed great when I played with it at a retail store. I was WRONG.This camera is incapable of taking indoor pictures of subjects that move! INCAPABLE! I don't just mean shutter lag when the flash is being used. I can live with a little shutter lag. But when the camera does fire, if the flash is used and the subject moves even a tiny bit the shot is lost to BLUR. I bought the camera to take pictures of my kids, so even with all the things it does well I consider it a total waste of money. There are children of family and friends who I have lost all opportunity to photograph because they were wiggling, and entire events (like birthdays at Chuck E Cheese's) where I have not one single usable shot. (Hold still?? Yeah, right.)I think the problem is that there are NO MANUAL CONTROLS. You can force the flash on or off, and that's it. There is no way to manually set the ISO, which could improve pictures of moving subjects.  Even my old Olympus 1.3 megapixel camera allowed me to set the ISO and take usable pictures of my kids (if they were still in the frame after a very long shutter lag). I am shocked that this camera, made by a company with such a good name, has such a major shortcoming. The camera does have some nice shooting scenes (read another review if you want the positives. I concede that it has some great capabilities in some shooting environments, most of which are outdoors.) But you are required to use the scenes as is, and there is no way to adjust them. I tried the Indoor/Party scene many times, and there are famiy gatherings, class parties, etc. where almost every shot is unusable due to the people moving and being blurry. The shots that I do have are posed, stiff, and unnatural, because everyone had to hold still through the shutter lag and the shutter release.So you still think it's my fault, right? Like there must be something I missed? (I thought that for so long. I should have returned it and got a refund. Instead I kept it for 8 months and lost $300, since I ended up buying another camera.) When I took the camera to my kid's class Christmas party, I tried several options. The auto mode sucks- you get dark AND blurry. Sports scene is great outside, but try it inside and your pictures are just black. So I used Indoor/Party scene with the flash off. This gave me pictures where the kids aren't all blurry, but which require LOTS of editing in Photoshop. I had to adjust the levels and lighting. Then they were so grainy and noisy that when I printed I got hair that looks like yarn. So I had to reduce the noice by a very high factor. This softens and blurs the overall look of the picture noticeably, but at least they were finally worthy of printing.My friend has a Sony Cybershot. and she's never had this problem. Pictures of her kids come out just fine. So I went back to the reviews and chose a Canon PowerShot A620. Many Canons have a shooting scene called Kids & Pets, which is optimized for photographing moving subjects. You can manually set the ISO, white balance, and other functions to optimize for your environment. Right out of the box I was able to set the Canon and take good pictures of my kids playing inside the house. Only after buying and playing with the Canon did I realize how much better the interface is, and how poor the Nikon's interface is. You shouldn't have to leave a shooting scene and switch the dial to Set-Up mode to adjust the camera's settings. WHY, NIKON, WHY?I see the Nikon Coolpix 7600 is still being sold for big bucks. If you want a camera for outdoor pictures, stiff portraits, or landscapes and scenery, then you may consider it. Some of its shooting scenes and features are very cool. But if you have children and you want natural pictures for their scrapbooks, please believe me and others who are warning you that this camera has a MAJOR defect. If you don't want to spend a grand on an SLR then leave Nikon alone and read reviews of Canon, Sony, Kodak, and Olympus.", "Date": "January 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Tiny Tank of the Digital Cameras", "Author": "TheNext007 \"Bond, James Bond\"", "ReviewID": "R1HK71DIYWWZC8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Nikon Coolpix 7600 for Christmas and decided to return it. It takes pictures of very impressive quality and the buttons are straight forward and easy to use. BUT, there is a significant lag time when you take a photo with flash, at least 5 seconds. That does not seem like a lot but when you're trying to take pics fast, you don't have the 5-7 seconds. MOST IMPORTANTLY: it drains batteries like a tank drains its gas tank. It's unreal, I used brand new batteries and they wereDONE after 25 pictures. (Some other camera's batteries can last up to 400 pics).

I got the coolpix 7600 last month and I like it so far, esp for the price (just over $200).  The camera can use various formats of AA batteries, including rechargable Ni-MH batteries.  My only beef with the camera so far is that there is a slight lag time between photos when you are using the flash - I assume this is because it uses AA batteries and it is recharging the flash.  At any rate aside from this it's a nice little compact and light camera - has many nice features and because of the low price I am not afraid to take it with me when travelling.", "Date": "February 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "One of the best Cameras I have ever owned!", "Author": "Christopher Ollendorf", "ReviewID": "R2REKF2CVJJCL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on the internet before buying the Coolpix 7600.  There were good and bad reviews of it on all the different sites but I spent some time at the stores looking at all the different cameras and this one just felt right.  I have owned it now for about a month and it works wonderfully!  I am not sure what that other mother/teacher was talking about because I get great shots of my kids and pets even as they run around the yard.  There are many settings so maybe she just has not set the camera to work right for her needs.  You do need to read instructions before using a camera!It has many settings and comes with great software to help compose, fix, and arrange your files. My favorite feature is the panarama one!  You can set the camera up on a tripod and then take mulitple pictures of a room or whatever.  Then after downloading the pics into your computer, the software helps you put all the pics together to make a panarama picture or even a 360 of the room you are in! It creates a movie of it and you can post these on the internet and share them with friends and family.  This is great for people who need to show off rooms or locations... travel agents or realestate agents could use this feature.One comment I saw a lot of was battery use and so far, I have been taking pictures and movies for weeks now and I am still using the batteries that came with the camera!  I was expecting the drain to be horrible from what others have said but so far, I have done about 200 pics and about 10 small movies on the one pair.  I did invest in rechargeable ones but so far have not needed to replace the original pair yet.The camera has many settings and it almost takes the worry out of how to set a picture up. My only challenge with the Coolpix is the movies that I have taken are okay but not like a video camera.  Movies outside are much better than movies inside due to the amount of light available. And if it is windy, the sound gets garbled. But I did not buy it to take movies... that was something extra in my opinion.  If I want movies I use my camcorder...

Here's my take on it:Pros:* Uses AA batteries, so no expensive replacement battery pack to buy* Very small and light - fits in a pocket or handbag* Lots of features - zoom lens, panorama, sunset, etc.* Optics are better than my CP995 - less purple fringing.Cons:* Chews through batteries like crazy - even 2300mAh NiMHs don't last long* Slow start up time and auto-focus* Very easy to get blurry pictures on anything above 3MP setting unless there's lots of ambient light. Annoyingly, this even happens when using the flash.* Auto color balance can be a bit screwy sometimes. I have had to use the manual setting and then forgotten to take it off. Lots of pink or blue pictures. Grrrr!* Easy to knock the mode wheel off setting and get an unwanted setting, or half-way between settings - whereupon the camera complains.* LCD is good resolution, but very small.

I had no problem learning how to use it and took around 3,000 photos with this camera on the trip.  My wife was carrying her state-of-the art Canon $5,000 dollar mega monster.  When I transferred the first set of pictures from the 7600 to my laptop and showed them to her she literally turned a different color in total disbelief of the quality of the pictures that I had taken with this camera.  She said that the 7600 \"Made Love\" to the colors because of the quality of the photos.  She also said that this camera proved that she had wasted a lot of money on her camera after looking at what the 7600 had produced. This camera is tough. I left it on a picnic table in the Yukon Territory one night and the camera got rained on.  Certain that it was a goner I put it in a warm dry place for 3 days (just had to try to save it) and when I turned it on every feature worked perfectly. I found that alkaline batteries would run down after shooting less than 100 pictures and tried lithium batteries. I did not think that the lithiums were ever going to go dead! I did not count the number of photos taken with the lithiums but would safely say that I was getting at least 7-800 photos before having to replace the batteries. I now also have a Canon Powershot S5 IS and have found that the rechargable NiMH batteries that I use in the S5 IS last as long as the lithium batteries did in the 7600 so now I use the rechargables in both cameras. I take a lot of photos and when running out the door for a quick jaunt I always grab the Nikon 7600 instead of my much more sophisticated Canon. This camera's size and capabilities make it as desirable as my Canon.

Bass", "ReviewID": "R2Z7G8PZVKXMH1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "OK, so I've had the Nikon Coolpix 7600 for 4 years now (today is 1/8/10) and I'm ready to upgrade.  Here's my experience:A) Bought it for vacation.  Didn't work.  Called Nikon while on vacation.  Not much help.  Customer Service was poor.  Took it back to Best Buy after the vaca and had to MAKE them call Nikon and go through all the \"problems\" before Nikon finally agreed to replace it.  Second camera was fine.  That must've just been a lemon but I was very frustrated because I wasn't able to use my new camera I had bought for vacation and had to go through all that hassle with Best Buy and Nikon.B) The photo-editing software that comes with it (Picture Project) is GREAT and I still use it regularly, even though I'm good at Photoshop, because it is quick, user-friendly and has great results.C) This camera is a little bulky (and heavy) compared to other products that are out there now, and the LCD screen is much smaller than what's available nowadays.  This LCD is only about 1.5\" wide.D) This camera is SLOW!  I don't know why, but it takes several seconds between shots to prepare itself to take another.  I went to Fry's and asked for help on this.  They recommended an Ultra SD card, which was supposed to help it save more quickly, but it didn't.  This camera is just slow.  And, I'm getting increasingly annoyed with it, as I have to say to my subjects, \"Wait...hold on a minute before leaving the pose.  My camera's just slow.\"E) The picture quality is excellent.  I mean, really, really, nice.  The additional settings are wonderful, too, and really work (once you learn how to properly access them.)  The fireworks mode works amazingly!  I'm a scrapbooker and love my 4th of July photos!F) The red-eye auto reduction inherent feature is great, too.  I rarely get any red-eye photos, and when I do, it's easy to edit them out on the Picture Project photo-editing software program included.G) Like some others have mentioned, in the last few months I've started getting Lens Errors, too.  No reason, just a malfunction that comes after time with this camera apparently.  It's happened to others and it will happen to you, too, if you get it and use it for any sustained amount of time.H) And, as others have complained, it goes through batteries like there's no tomorrow.  I learned this early on, so I simply invested $18 at Sam's club on about 24 AA rechargable batteries and a recharger pack.  I keep batteries charging at all times.  However, I actually like the fact that this camera is powered by AAs, as it can be very convenient if you forget to charge the \"camera battery\" or bring it with you.  You can stop at any convenience store and buy some AAs and you're ready to go until you get back home and replace with rechargables.I) Overall--was a good camera for a year or so, but there is so much better out there now, and for a lot more of an affordable price.  This isn't worth the investment, as it won't last more than a couple of years.

I too personally miss and dislike the fact that there is no ISO setting but, like other manufacturers, these settings have been created in the consumer icon driven menu. There is a reason why there are over 2 dozen different modes to shoot pictures with to address the needs of most situations. It has a \"sports\" setting which will allow you to take pictures of objects in motion and even get a quasi \"film\" capture where the shutter will shoot rapid pictures in succession of 16 frames (fit into 7MP setting if you have it.) It doesn't work perfectly all the time but it usually does. Most of my pictures are gorgeous and all my friends say so.Regarding the battery life - these people are either not charging their batteries or are not bright enough to own a camera. I could EASILY squeeze out 100 pictures of my 2 batteries and usually more. These claims about 40 pictures and then it conks out - ridiculous. I don't believe many of these reviews any more and wonder if people are just plain vacuous or they have another camera from another brand so the reviews are mindless bashing.Regarding the autofocus, almost all of these cameras don't focus quickly. I had a Minolta which was the same. Get an SLR if you don't want to miss your quick baby shots. With an autofocus you'll win some but will also be frustrated for quick shots.For general purpose use, this camera is very good. It's small, uses double AA standard size batteries (none of those non-standard expensive Canon brand), standard SD card (no expensive proprietary Sony memory sticks) and is easy to hold in your hand. This camera is fantastic if you just learn how to use it. The 7MP photos enable you to blow up the detail in pictures which is rather remarkable. Like any camera, it's not perfect but at the $300 I got it for it's really been fantastic. My next will probably be an SLR and at least I know and have read about what I'm getting for my money.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good camera, not as good as I hoped...", "Author": "P.
