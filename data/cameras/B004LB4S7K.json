Very easy to use. Takes perfect pictures with no blur. It's so nice not having to hold really still while snapping the picture. The color is perfect no matter what the lighting is. I have Windows 7 and the pictures are very easy to import. Just plug it in and Windows will install the drivers. There's no annoying software program to deal with. I also have a Kodak C143 and this GE camera is so much better all the way around.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "just the camera i needed", "Author": "JDK", "ReviewID": "R3IP51U6Q7HVX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With the proliferation of smart phones, you sometimes need a camera that gives you a little more, like optical zoom, higher quality, etc.This one does it.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera but carry a lot of batteries", "Author": "stevec", "ReviewID": "RQLOQ3B6CSQBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have gotten some  good shots with this little camera and it has some nice features for the price. If you are taking pictures for any length of time it goes through 2 AA batteries about every 2-4 hours even with a power saver feature. I liked the size,features, and price. But I won't use it as much as I planned, due to the battery life.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004LB4S7K"}}
