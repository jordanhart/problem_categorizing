They need to include diagrams and written instructions for a person like me who is not electronically adapt.  However the instrutions for setting date, time, quads etc, once you figure out how to get it to work with the recorder and monitor, are very understandable.  Once it is all installed, the processor works great.  I like how you can very easily use 1, 2, 3 or all 4 cameras and change set up whenever you want.  For the price, it is very reasonable and works well with an older system.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Color Quad Procesor 1EY", "Author": "Brandon G.

This unit fills the bill with lots of extra bells and whistles.  Read the product description and it will tell you all about it.  This unit is very small in size 6X4X1-1/4 inches.  One feature that they don't mention is when the unit is turned on it comes up showing all four cameras on one screen, one in each quadrant.  Why is this important?  The way this device is used in this my application it is located with 4 mini DVRs VideoSecu Mini Security CCTV DVR Recorder Motion Detection Overwrite Schedule Videos with Audio Recording 3UAin a small hidden locked cabinet.  The output of the Color Quad System is feed via one Siamese RG59 coax to a video capture adaptor that plugs into a USB 2 port on a PC.  The two wires on the Siamese cable control the power to the Color Quad System.  This allows the system to be powered up only when needed from my computer location to view the image which always comes up as all four cameras on screen.  This set up also allows you to record the images on the PC.  Some one who breaks in and could get to the PC and figure out how to see the images would think that the PC is the recorder and not realize that this was not the case.  I would buy this product again as it meets all my needs.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great product, cheap price, straight to the point", "Author": "VT", "ReviewID": "R2SXZ4KES4UYMP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It does exactly what I wanted - a four-way split on a single screen showing my 4 cameras.  It has more complex software involved if you're interested (ex: zoom, motion detection, etc.), but this isn't necessary for my situation.  I put up cameras to monitor my dogs in the backyard just by changing the input on my television (and one on the front porch to see visitors).  For this application, it worked flawlessly and I couldn't be happier.  I've had it for about 8 months now, and it works just like new.  It also notifies you if a camera goes down (if, for example, a wire or plug gets jostled and becomes temporarily loose) with a loud set of beeps.  Cool product.

Reading the reviews I was somewhat skeptical, because you never know which review you can relate to. But, mine worked perfectly. Unboxed it, connected the 2 cams I needed it for and works just fine. It's annoying when people complain about quality and whatnot. You get what you pay for, it's a $40 unit - if you want HD spend some real cash. I just needed something simple to split 2-4 cams I have around my house for live constant viewing. I'm fairly electronically advanced so setting the menu, date/time was quite simple. Thanks for sending me a unit that actually works and gets the job done. Now, only HOPE it continues to work over time and doesn't die!Edit: 2 weeks later, the timecode on it dies out. I'm sitting here watching it as I am typing this, the seconds is flickering back and forth, skipping numbers. I can turn it off and back on and it resets properly, but goes right back to the problem.
