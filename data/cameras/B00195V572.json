{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice product!", "Author": "Sam I Am \"I am what I am\"", "ReviewID": "R3ORJW9C8B7OEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this product expecting to see a drop in quality - it was part of a system to connect a PC and a HD video camera system to a projector on another side of a gymnasium/multi-purpose room. To say it worked well is an understatement - we are running through 100 feet of cat-5e cable and the picture looks every bit as good as connecting the projector directly to the machine using a VGA cable. I am totally impressed with the ease of set-up, quality of the balun (it even comes with velcro to mount it), and quality of the image transfer.As a result, I am buying another set of baluns to allow presenters to use their own laptops on-stage but tie into our audio-video booth on the back side of an auditorium.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$68.40", "Features": "1 Input Device\n1 Output Device\n350 ft Range\n1 x Network (RJ-45)\n45)", "Name": "Vga Balun Ii Db15 Female Monitor Side Side", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31SkF95LyaL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00195V572"}}
