{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An easy to use, long zoom  Digital camera with room to grow.", "Author": "K. Heller \"Diamondgirl5\"", "ReviewID": "RHC8C2ZT9RD6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned 4 Kodak digital cameras, the last 3 being the DX7590, the P850 and now the P712, which I have owned for a month.  The camera has a long zoom (12x), which is the same as the P850, so my filters, adapter, external flash and lenses fit both cameras.  The P850 and the P712 both have a hot shoe and I had the Kodak P20 flash, which works seamlessly with both cameras.  The only quibble I had with the P850 was that it took a couple of seconds between shots and was a little slow from the time you push the shutter to when the picture is taken.  I have found the times for both on the P712 to be improved.  The resolution of the P712 also is 7 megapixels, versus the 5 megapixels for the P850.  The higher resolution helps if you want to enlarge pictures such as 8x10 or larger.Kodak cameras are know to be easy to use and the P712 lives up to this, just run it on Auto.  The camera also has several scene modes, which preset the camera for special situations such as sunset, snow, beach, sports, portraits, candlelight, fireworks, etc.  The P712 also has a panorama mode, which enables you to stitch 2 or 3 pictures taken into one wide picture.  I have used several of the scene modes and they work well.  the panorama mode works well also, after taking one picture, the camera will show part of the previous picture so that you can line up the 2nd or 3rd pictures.Although the camera works as a point and shoot, it's also a camera with room to grow.  It includes Program, shutter priority, aperture priority and full manual modes, as well as 3 modes that you can customize for unique situations.  Flash and exposure compensation, flash settings, white balance and other settings are easily accessed and used.The hot shoe is great to use with an external flash.  I have used the P20 flash for weddings and large group events and the flash has worked well at lengths up to 30', such as my daughter's concert.  Most digital cameras don't have a hot shoe unless they're more expensive than the $398 I paid.  The camera also has image stabilization, which helps when you're using the zoom extended out.  Without image stabilization, cameras pick up the small shaking of your hands and pictures come out blurred unless you use a tripod.  You do need to use a tripod if you're taking a picture in a low light situation without flash; this is normal even in film photography due to the lens having to stay open longer.What's included: the camera, lens cap, neck strap, EasyShare Software, a rechargeable battery and charger, a USB cord, a cord to connect the camera to a TV or computer (I've used this to view pictures over friends' TV) owner's manual and the insert to use with Kodak docks and printers.Transferring pictures to your computer is easy: you can connect the camera with the included USB cord, use a secure digital card and remove the card and use a card reader, or purchase one of Kodak's printer or camera docks.  I have the Kodak Easy Share printer dock plus and have found it easy to print 4x6\" prints, transfer pictures and charge the camera's battery simply by placing the camera on the dock and pushing a button.The bottom line: The camera is easy to use, takes great pictures, allows for creativity and has room to grow.  If you're looking for more than just a simple point and shoot, or are looking to make the switch from film photography and enjoy photography, try the P712.", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Kodak's top-of-the-line is first rate", "Author": "Thomas Kerr \"Algonquin Patron\"", "ReviewID": "R2FR8HFZSN5VS9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the P712 as an upgrade and gift over the holidays. I think that the learning curve is past me at this point and now have a handle on how to take a decent photo with this super-zoom. Here's what you might like:*Excellent zoom lens with world class optics.*Shooting a photo in Auto mode makes picture taking easy.*7.1 mp provides for good detail.*Very good battery life. 200+ shots using the rechargeable included.*Manual mode, Shutter priority mode and aperture mode are great for the serious amateur.*Uses SD cards which are inexpensive and easily found.*Does all it's metering through the lens so filters and add on optics work well.*True optical image stabilization.A few reviews mentioned Kodak's add on lenses. I have both the telephoto and wide angle and must say they really extend the optical range of the P712. The telephoto turns the camera into a 635mm lens, the wide angle down to about 20mm. The Flash that Kodak markets with this unit is also pro level with enough \"oompf\" to light a auditorium.I'm pleased and impressed with this camera. I'm getting great shots with it. I think you will too.Any downshots? A few:*Video is marred by sound of auto-focus. Forget about using the zoom while making a video, it sounds like a truck is driving by.*Tends to overexpose a  little in bright sunlight in auto mode.*Not pocketable-this is a substantial camera.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "This camera is awesome.", "Author": "Mark Butler \"butlmars\"", "ReviewID": "R28X53CDFYJW76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned a fully manual Minolta 35 mm, then a 3.1 digital Kodak.  The 3.1 was nice, but lacked control over needed features.  The P712 is full of options and mimicks most of the features on my 35 mm.  I have almost full control over the features.  The beauty is that the control is optional.  I can set the camara to \"Auto\" and it functions just like a point and shoot camera.The pictures are beautifully clear and sharp.  The optical zoom still amazes me.  The battery typically lasts about 160 pictures, using the flash most of the time.  On the highest resolution a picture is about 2.6 meg.

I thought I was a decent photographer and could do a lot with a camera.  WHen Digital came out with all the automatic settings and 'no thinking required' settings, I lost enthusiasm for the sport. The P712 has brought my interest in photography back to life.Along with all the good things everyone else is saying about this camera, it has the ability to give the photographer complete control over every critical factor in making the photograph.  Not just aperture and shutter speed, but white balance, 'film speed', quality level, color, B&W; or Sepia, and a multitude of other user controllable features.  This camera is loads of fun for me as I enjoy messing around with all the settings.If you are a person who doesn't enjoy all the playing around I just described, you can be assured this camera will deliver the best pictures possible in it's Automatic mode.  It's is the best point and shoot camera I've ever had.  But it can do so much more.I like the feel of the P712 much better than the Z612.  The 612 has a plastic/flimsy feel to it, in my opinion.  It seems a bit larger and more substantial than the 612 although I expect the picture quality is about the same.  I am very pleased with my 712.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "F*A*N*T*A*S*T*I*C, by a serious amatuer camera person", "Author": "JPN \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R3QU7HTVDPFZBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Kodak over the last 40+ years. (Both film & digital) First was a Kodak Retina Reflex III (SLR), fully manual.  Then I went to a Kodak \"point and shoot\" digital at 2MP(fully automatic).  It was great, but I missed all the creative things I used to be able to do.  The camera gave me good pictures, but the process was kind of boring, especially in unique suitations.  Well, now the P712 is all I ever had and much, much more.  First, it's through the len, no parallex, what you see is what you get. Secondly, it's a tremendous 12X optical zoom with image stabalization (a necessity).  Thirdly, it can go full manual w/ f/stops, ASA film ratings up to ASA800 @1.2MP,and a full range of shutter speeds.  And just in case your are not that technical, it has 20 or so preset \"Scene\" modes that calculate those special settings for you.  Add manual focus, flash options (red eye/fill/none), a \"hot shoe\" for an extra flash right on the camera. (most on camera flashes are only good for about 8-10 feet), and a \"Movie Mode\" and you have everything.  And oh yes, an on camera mode for cropping in the review mode that saves your original as well as the cropped image.  I recommend the optional P-20 flash and especially the optional lens tube extension to protect the lens in case of dropping. And, one more thing, selective grid lines in the viewfinder, or view screen for lining up pictures.  Can you tell I LOVE it.  It really brings back the joy of photography at a reasonable price.And it captures unbelievable detail.

I got mostly blurry pictures and wasn't happy with the clear ones that I did get.  The Kodak on the other hand, has exceeded my expectations.  Despite some bad reviews I decided to get this one because of the price and the options it offered.  I love the zoom, and it's really not very bulky considering the size of the lens.  The pictures are crisp and clear, the color is vibrant.  I love the large LCD on the back and all the buttons are very easy to find and navigate.  Overall, I am very impressed with camera and very happy I purchased it.  I thought I might be disappointed because I've owned 3 Nikon Point-and-Shoot cameras in the past but I haven't looked back.

Now with the P712, i have great qualtiy optics, a very wide range zoom with fantastic macro capabilities, and video features that go way beyond the DX-4530, also you can use an AC-addapter with the P712 to both shoot and process your photos, so if it is convienent to plug into a wall, you can avoid using batteries all together if you need to.  This Camera is great, and also allows me to continue to use the SD memory cards i had purchased for use with my DX-4530 camera.  All thing considered, this was the perfect \"step-up\" for me in a digital camera. I have done a lot of photography with my old Pentax SLR camera, and was hesitant to make the jump to digital but with computer editing software, the digital media is so far and beyond what used to be posible with an old 35mm-film SLR camera.  Dont hesitate to go digital, you will be glad you did, but do buy the best camera you can afford.  I gave my old DX-4530 to my kids because the new P712 lets me do so much more, and forget about limitations.

I have owned several Kodak cameras and Kodak consistently delivers quality and features with its products.  The only negative thing I have to say concerns the easyshare software.  For the most part it works well but the built in update feature seems to conflict with Microsoft Windows.  I have tried installing it on several machines with different Windows operating systems with the same result.  Also, I do not like the way that the program takes control of every picture (jpeg, tiff or gif) file on your machine and forces it to be a Kodak image and open it primarily in the Easyshare software.

This camera is rugged and a real performer. I originally started with a Z740 Kodak point and shoot and moved up to the P712 because of the good results I had with my Z740. The accessory lenses (55mm) I had purchased for the Z740 worked just fine with the P712 and I've been doing a huge amount of macro photography with the new set up.I do note that in movie mode, the motor noise of this camera is very noticeable, but luckily, that is a rare mode I select with this bridge camera. The battery life is somewhere around 250 - 270 shots per charge and I did buy a second battery to keep me shooting for extended day photo shoots.The menus are easy to understand and I've been pleased with the image stabilization. I do recommend that you get a nice tripod set and beanbag for macro work, since even the image stabilization is overcome by camera shake at the magnification levels needed for macro shots.I did purchase the flash attachment specifically for this camera and was very pleased with the results. All in all, a very good purchase and one I have no regrets about. My only wish is that Kodak will bring back it's professional line and focus on building high-end DSLR cameras since I've become loyal to the brand and think the world of the cameras I have purchased from them.I recommend the P712 for the user who isn't quite ready for a DSLR and who wants enough control over photographs to do interesting work and yet still has the benefit of automation of exposure working for you.The P712 is a good camera and worth every penny!

Grand", "ReviewID": "R3AHGOW3G2LV3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the Kodak P712 but have not seen it yet as I sent it to the USA for my Husband to pick up for me when he visits there (we live in Mexico). I was concerned as I did not want to buy the adaptor (was not going to purchase any other lens, just filters). I could not find out if the camera did indeed accepts filters with out the adaptor. I received conflicting reports about it. The PDF manual stated that it had lens threads, but did not specify the size. A Kodak forum said that the thread size was 53mm, but after about four emails back and forth to Kodak they were very sketchy about answering my question about filters being able to attach 'directly' to the lens. They told me there were no lens filters available for the camera. Then they stated that, yes, a 55mm would fit DIRECTLY  onto the camera and told me that the P850 lens adapter is the compatible lens adapter for the camera. This still was not clear to me if it definitely needed the adaptor for just the filters alone. I emailed them again only to receive an even more sketchy reply with no direct answer to my question. I emailed still again and received this reply (words misspelled). Still didn't answer my 'filter' question.'For a better use of the camera and for evit any kind of issue wiht thelens that your are trying to use, we recomended to buy the exactly lensthat you see in our web site and do not listen to the other that aremaking invents with his or her camera. This is only for your benefitsand for a great perfomance of the camera.' I was fortunate enough to find someone who lives here in Mexico that had the P712 and was able to check his camera out. Sure enough, there were threads in the lens. Only thing was that if you actually purchased the 55mm size that they claimed fit right onto the camera, they would not have fit at all. If I had purchased the lens thread size stated 53mm on the forum, the lens would have popped the filter right out when turning the camera on and would had caused irreparable damage to the camera and motor.However, I  thought I would mention this as I have not seen any clear answer to this anywhere else. It is very difficult, if not impossible to get the accessories here and wanted to order them before my Husband's trip.I rated the camera a 5 as it looked good when I saw the one my friend owns.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "JOHN HETSCH", "ReviewID": "R1ROVQ3Y6EF6VT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "KOKAK HAS BEEN IN MY LIFE FOR 53 YEARS, STARTING WITH A KODAK PONY 35mm CAMERA, A KODAK SIGNET 35, A KODAK RETINA IIIc, NOW A KODAK P712 DIGITAL.
