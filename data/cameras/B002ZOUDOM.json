Decided to get this Fuji with just an LCD screen and no view finder.  Well, guess what???  In ANY outdoor shot, the LCD screen is useless.  Wrote to Fuji and they made some suggestions - none of which worked.  Thought it was my eyes so gave the camera to my husband and he said, \"how can you take outdoor pictures - you can't see a thing\"!!  Point and shoot is what you try and if you are lucky, you get what you were trying to shoot.  Also, camera only comes with a CD for instructions but Fuji did send me a booklet upon request.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Crap", "Author": "Captain Insano", "ReviewID": "R2255OKTFFS7IL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this as a gift for a family member. Broke within it's first month of use. Lens became stuck, and place I purchased from would not cover repairs/refund. Going to try Fuji directly, next. But take it from me, you will want to avoid this one, and the headache.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good basic camera, but would not purchase from Buy.com again.", "Author": "Swifty", "ReviewID": "R33705C5VU9B5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did not realize this was a purchase through [...] or I would not have ordered it.
