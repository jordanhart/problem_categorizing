{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad but not great", "Author": "TVGuy", "ReviewID": "R4A2XWP3MSZLX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This hidden motion detector camera and mic are just as shown in the picture. The video quality is good, but the angle of view seems to be only about 45 degrees, which is very small. You have to angle the device directly at what you are trying to view. Therefore, in narrow hallways or when what is needed to see is far away, this camera is great. When you want to set up a camera in a wider room, you should look elsewhere. Finally, there is a red light that flashes every time the motion detector picks up motion, which draws considerable attention to itself (kind of defeats the purpose). I suppose you can take off the casing and remove the red light, but it is wired directly into a motherboard of sorts. So, I'm not sure if that would affect any of the other workings. I am sending it back.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005GBILG8"}}
