The first was a 14.1 MP and I can say less than $80 for this 20.1 MP, you can't find it anywhere else! It functions very well. It can take pictures even in the darkest place. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera for a good price!", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for vacation snapshots", "Author": "M. Lee", "ReviewID": "R1T4GL34N6VU9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a very occasional photographer, so this camera meets my needs very well.  I find it easy to operate.  This camera has a rechargeable LI-ON battery, and this is an improvement over my older camera that uses AA batteries.  I like the feature that corrects for camera shake, as I had sometimes had blurry photos with my older camera and this is much improved with the Sony.  Obviously, if you're a serious photographer, this is not the camera for you, but for me, it's great.  I like to buy a less expensive camera in case I drop it in a lake or off a bridge by accident, and this seems fine for the price.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Tracy L.

Perhaps I need some time to study it and experiment, but I am disappointed with the picture quality.  It looks awesome on the viewer but after the button is pushed the picture is fuzzy somewhat.  Not clear and crisp. The features are more trouble to access on the menu,  but may get easier with time and use.  The main complaint I have is the picture quality. It just doesn't measure up.  I found another Sony 8 mp 150, like new and purchased it from a private seller. I may sell this 800, we'll see.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "20.1 MP where?", "Author": "fred brady", "ReviewID": "RRITD550DACX4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I knew for this cheap price i would not get a good quality camera anywhere. So i decided to give it a try and buy this one, since 20.1 MP sounds fantastic! The problem is.. I do not see that many pixels on the photos, it is so frustrating. I really expected this camera to make better pictures. Remember to buy a memory card too!I could not find the special effects for the colors such as grey etc.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Betty L.

Don't forget that, for those that complain about the quality from Any camera, it's a no-brainer. The various levels of megapixel quality is great.With my last Sony Touchscreen 8mp Camera, there is a little tiny bios battery hidden in the camera. It goes out in a couple or few years and then you send it in to get it \"repaired\" not knowing what happened. I never sent it it to get it \"repaired\" for a whole 200 dollars. I discovered this hidden secret battery on my own and haven't been able to stick the new battery on quite yet. I hope that Sony didn't do that to this camera too.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "zelmar arteta", "ReviewID": "R78CVQQRYYEB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "sony great model camera, delivered ok, little pack, good pricepros: allcons: noi recomend this camera to any", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony camera", "Author": "clint", "ReviewID": "RBSUVLXFQXWF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the money this is a deal.
