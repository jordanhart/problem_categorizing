The product was definitely not as described and do not buy from the seller Heracles Trades - they put the Pyle name and model on the bar codes on a bag exterior to the package making it seem like a Pyle product but they are straight up dishonest and scamming. I am in the process of fulfilling the same cameras from Amazon (use the More buying choices) option on the right - costs a dollar more but totally worth not going through the hassle of disappointment and returns so hoping the right product comes this time...if i can update this later i'll do just that and let you know.Amazon gave great customer service to fix this issue so kudos to Kimberly :O) and the only reason I am giving more than a single star.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Take your chances...", "Author": "HisRadness", "ReviewID": "R12SXTV7NO5MDY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Same as other reviews.  First I received a generic, rear view only, camera from Heracles.  It looks the same, but doesn't have the jumper wires to switch the image or remove the guide lines.

The second one externally looked the same with the same mount but it did not have the jumper wires so could only be used as a reverse camera.  Not sure if the camera was packaged in the wrong box or what, but these are supposed to be front- or rear-selectable (therein the FRV designation.)  Camera works well enough and has a decent wide angle view, but it is very hard to judge distances (proximity) to obstacles.

I routed it to a Pioneer AVIC X940BT head unit with a SPST switch tied to the reverse sensor wire. The resolution is acceptable, but certainly not spectacular. It works well in darkness. The instructions are very detailed and easy to understand. I used it for a front camera, but it can be set for rear view (mirror image) by simply twisting two wires together. You can also turn the distance lines off and on by attaching or detaching another wire. Make sure you don't get a rear-only camera if you're going to mount it in the front, or your image will be backwards. I would buy this again.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Bruce K.", "ReviewID": "R1WEGVMVDMVCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Using as a backup camera on my jeep.

But mine came from Amazon and where genuine Pyle camera's with all parts, cables and manuals.For my purposes they are working great.  But to be honest am not using them as rear view cameras.  I use them mounted to front bumper and under truck as \"trail\" cameras for offroading.  For this purpose the cameras have been working great.  They give me a fairly clear field of view, with a slight fish eye effect.  They do fairly well in low light and shade and are very clear in the daylight.

Both the first camera received and the one which Amazon replaced it with are 90 degrees.  I called Pyle.  They insist that the camera is 170 degrees and suggested that I try PLCM18BC.  I cannot return the PLCM38FRV, because I cut a hole in my truck before testing the angle (trusting the vendor).  Replacing the truck part will cost more than leaving the camera in the hole.You be the judge.  Pyle PLCM7700 claims to have 170 degree viewing angle.  Go to Youtube and look at the 5 minute 30 second point on video watch?v=iNjEuNAKYww.  That is definitely not 170 degrees.I am surprised that Amazon sells their products.

The product title and description both say that it is optional front view and rear view. Well, I opened the box and there were no instructions. I looked at the manufacturer website (Pyle Audio) and they did not have a manual for this model either. I did not even bother installing this and have returned this for a refund. It maybe a good camera and I am sure it would have worked in the rear but for the front installation you need to turn off the mirror view otherwise everything that will be displayed on the monitor will look as if its a mirror reflection which is only good for reversing. Usually there is a cable with a jumper or a loop that you cut in order to turn the mirror view on/off. This camera did not have that. There were only 2 cables attached to it - the yellow video RCA and the red one for power. Also, the image that is shown in the product description is misleading. It shows a blue and a red cable in addition to the 2 RCA ones mentioned but they were not there on the product I received. Also, I did not see an LED for night vision unless it is built into the camera lens itself. I recommend passing on this product and looking at other cameras such as a Lockpick MINICAM221", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "...Quick..quite fix", "Author": "slimjim", "ReviewID": "R5IWR7VCNDZOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a great rear view, mirror monitor, also made by Pyle...I recently damaged the camera portion of the unit..If you can believe it, I was reversing when it happened...needless to say, the camera along with my bumper..Totally trashed.
