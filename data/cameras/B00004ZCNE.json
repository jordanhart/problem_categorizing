It is easy with a capital E.This little camera takes wonderful pictures in just about any lighting,with NO FLASH.If you have suffered the hell of red eye,you will love this little camera,no red eye,ever again!And it also handles video conferencing,and can make 10 second silent video clips to send in your e-mails to whomever.It also includes a self timer so that you can take pictures of yourself,or get into the pictures with others.Another little wonder of this camera is the \"burst\"feature.With this feature,the camera takes a burst of 5 pictures in 1 second!!Great for fast action sequences.I had a little problem with downloading the software,but a toll free call to Kodak and I was up and running in 10 minutes or less.I sent pictures to my friends in thier e-mail and they all told me that the quality of the pictures were fabulous!!I don't know how well the pictures would look if printed out,but for e-mail,web pages,and just general fun without paying a small fortune,the Kodak EZ 200 just cannot be beat for the money.If you are just starting to think about buying a digital camera, try this little baby before you buy an expensive model and see if it doesn't fit all your digital camera needs.It's no bigger then a mans billfold,and only about an inch thick.It has a little wrist srtap so that you can carry it anywhere and it weighs almost nothing.I slip it into my coat pocket and whip it out whenever I see something I want a picture of.It runs on 4 AAA batteries.I have only had this camera for 48 hours and I can't imagine being without it,it is wonderful!!", "Date": "February 4, 2001"}, {"Title": "Best buy for the money", "Author": "See", "ReviewID": "R2KNFA5KC6OJ8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this digital camera from Amazon, and there was no photo available.  So I purchased it based on comparisons with other cameras in the same price range.  When I first received it, I thought, \"What a dinky little camera! It looks like a toy.\"  But I did not want to spend too much money on a digital camera that I don't know if I would use much.  The first day, I started taking pictures in all kinds of light - in a room with a single light, in the closet with the single bulb, in the family room, and outside, and in public libraries.  And when I transferred the pictures to my computer, I was amazed at the quality.  All of the pictures came out with perfect lighting.  Also, the camera is small enough to fit in my palm.  It has self timer, and can also be used as a PC camera to video-chat.  Best of all, because it is so ordinary looking, no one is going to steal it.", "Date": "December 31, 2000"}, {"Title": "Not much more than a toy - but a great toy", "Author": "mimozas_husband", "ReviewID": "R18WE2VV6UEZKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For its price the camera gives an opportunity to experience the fun of digital pictures and making your own little movies. The camera takes low quality pictures that look a little grainy even on the screen.

And believe me, there are some bad ones out there. Kodak arguably makes the best digital cameras on the market. Only Sony has as high a quality-to-price ratio. With that said, the Kodak EZ 200 is one of Kodak's best products.I bought the Kodak EZ200 expecting an \"adaquete\" camera, that I could just use to get a vague image of myself on the web. Color me very suprised when I discovered it took pictures that were slightly better than a $150 35mm camera. Even more impressive was the fact that this little camera, which was smaller than my wallet, not only could hold 64 of them, but take three shot bursts, 10 second video clips, and was capable of streaming video over the web. All of which it did flawlessly.Digital photography lives. And for $90, this camera is worth every dime, which is something you can't say for a lot of electronics, especially digital cameras.- Louis", "Date": "May 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "Delivers what you pay for", "Author": "Matthew Buss", "ReviewID": "R1EIRE2IDPMBYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to set up and operate, this camera gives you what you pay for.

Carver", "ReviewID": "R3LH6X8H6UGBC0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was looking forward to using this camera, based on the reviews here, but I've actually been really disappointed.  Kodak got the form-factors right -- it's easy (even fun!) to use and I liked the little sound effects.  But the image quality is dismal, even for VGA resolution.  We have an old VGA-resolution Kodak digital camera at work, and I was expecting at least that level of resolution.  Instead, the edges of the photos were smeared and blurry, and there was very little usable detail in any of the test photos I took.  True, the colors were bright and it handled exposure/light levels well.  But what use is that when the photos resemble a Monet painting?  I wanted an inexpensive camera that produced small photos that I could email to relatives (and avoid having to shrink down mega-pixel files).  The quality of the pictures in this camera, however, is just way too low to be usable.  It's going back to the store!  It's a shame -- it's such a fun little machine!  If it were ... cheaper, I might consider keeping.  PS:  It's not just this camera -- this is the second one I tried and they both had the same problem -- extreme distortion around the edges of the pictures.  My photos look nowhere near as clear as the samples on ... website!", "Date": "April 18, 2001"}, {"Title": "Small Camera, Small Price", "Author": "Maverick Martin", "ReviewID": "R38RGINI3ZP9FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera this afternoon and I am very impressed with it.  I found a great deal on this camera so I bought it for my 12 year-old daughter.  It stores 64 photos at it's highest resolution (640X480) and 128 at it's lowest.  We shot a bunch of pictures in all of it's formats on the way home and around the house in all sorts of lighting conditions.  I was surprised by how well it worked in low light.  The shots outside were more than acceptable in color quality, depth of field and exposure.  It is very light weight and fits easily into a shirt pocket.

Not for hi-grade photos, though.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RW9UN0NAT5QF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mostly to play around with and to be able to email simple and impulsive photos.  I really like this little camera.  If you're looking for quality photographs you're not going to find it unless you go to at least 2-3 megapixels.  Digital cameras are not to the point of getting high quality images for pocket change just yet.  Capturing images on film is much simpler than with electronics (you can take film pictures with a shoe box with a pinhole in it if you know what you're doing).  I say all that to emphasize that this is probably one of the best deals you will find in an inexpensive digital camera.  I found the camera simple to operate (although I've not really used the software since I already have photo editing software).  Some of the pictures may not look so great when you first download them, but a few simple clicks usually balances light, color and sharpness to decent levels (I have also held blue a filter in front of the lens when shooting to balance incandescent indoor lighting with very good results).  When I email images, I usually size them down to 400x300 or 320x240 and they look even better.  I have only had the camera a short while and it has been a lot of fun and has delivered some suprizingly good pictures (and a lot of junk ones, too, so shoot in volume - it's cheap!).  The one thing that is a little disappointing is the distortion -- usually it's unnoticable or insignificant; sometimes it's bad.  Like any fixed focus camera (the manual focus is only for web cam operation) don't expect to get close up.  If you're looking for a cheap thrill this is your camera.  This camera is not fancy, but it does what it says it does.  If you're looking for a camera to do high quality pictures, close-up work, or capture once-in-a-lifetime shots then you need to be willing to fork out some cash on a digital camera (I couldn't find a digital that would approach what I would want for less than $300; personally, I will wait till I can get what is now a $500-700 camera).  If you're going to be an uptight perfectionist (like I am with my 35mm SLR), you will be frustrated with this camera.  If you want to hang loose and have some fun for cheap, then you need this camera!  It's great!", "Date": "October 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best money I ever spent!", "Author": "Patricia M.

But the thing that bothers me about it is that you are always compensating to get the actual shot you are looking for.  Even though the lens is right under the eye hole, it seems to take pictures right, left, up, or down of that point and so when you are trying to use the camera for life's little events, you can lose a lot of shots!The quality of the picture isn't that great either.
