{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why I decided on the Pentax Kx", "Author": "Mike C", "ReviewID": "R23UY2WEP4YBNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid reader of reviews and many times use this information to help in my buying decision.  Since I suppose I am like most others who shop, compare, read, read some more and still can't decide I hope this might help in your quest for the right camera.  Of the cameras I tried, all were very nice and I would be happy with any of them.I have been looking for a camera that will give me the biggest bang for my buck!  I hope to spend more time using my camera as a hobby.  Until now have used my point and shoot Canon S3IS digital for kids, family, show choir and sporting events.  The Canon S3IS is a great camera; I just want to step up a bit.I started looking at used Nikon camera bodies as I had an old Nikon 2020  35mm film camera with the 35-70mm & 70-210mm AF lens.  I stopped by my local camera shop and found my old lenses would work on the Nikon D50, D70, D80 and D90 bodies.  I didn't find anything used locally or on eBay (too expensive) that I wanted so I looked at the new Nikon D90.  Since Canon is the other big player in this field I decided to consider their cameras as well.Both manufacturers offered what I wanted in a camera; the ability to capture video, able to shoot in low light and had quick and accurate autofocus capabilities.  I tried both brands back and forth for several weeks and preferred the Canon T1i. I proceeded to sell my older Nikon equipment to help pay for the Canon T1i and move that directionWhile saving for my new purchase and reading about digital SLR cameras I became aware of some of other SLR brands.  I found several online reviewers that had good comments about these less popular cameras.  Sony, Olympus, etc had nice features but for one reason or another I took them out of contention.  Sony, I thought the lenses were too expensive.  The Olympus just didn't click with me.(pun intended)  Pentax had very good remarks and had similar capabilities as the Canon T1i.  Best of all, the Pentax is considerably cheaper than the Canon.What helped me to lean towards the Pentax Kx was that I was able to watch some video shots taken with the Nikon, Canon and Pentax on Google.  I preferred the Pentax video, it didn't seem jerky in motion.  Still pictures side by side were also very similar in clarity.  I also read several reviews comparing the Canon and Pentax side by side with very similar remarks about the performance of both cameras.  The biggest positive comment about the Pentax was the exceptional low light pictures it could take. The biggest complaint with the Pentax Kx was a battery issue mentioned by a number of reviewers.  I called Pentax and spoke with a technical rep about the battery issue and any other issues Pentax might be having.  I was told the battery issue has been taken care of with a firmware update.  I must say I was impressed with the tech rep.  He was very helpful, took time to discuss his products and said that if I ever had a problem with my Pentax to give them a call as they were here to help me out.I can use any Pentax lens, new or old on this camera.  The lenses I will likely use most is the 55-300mm or the 18-55mm.  Both these are included in the kit I purchased.  Since vibration reduction is built into the body of the camera instead of the lens, any lens I use will automatically be a vibration reduction lens.I purchased the Pentax Kx with the 18-55mm and 55-300mm lens package for $653.00 on Amazon.  It stated the Pentax camera kit would ship in 1-4 months but I ordered it on Friday and it arrived the following Wednesday, less than a week's time, not bad!My thoughts about the camera.Positives:-It's a fairly compact body but not too small.  My wife likes the size and it's not heavy hanging around the neck.-The menu is fairly straight forward (I haven't had to pull the book out yet and can still get around easy enough!)-Takes very good pictures in several of the modes I tried.  Very pleased.-The auto focus is relatively fast and hits dead on at what I am pointing at.-Some nice filter features are included in the menu options, great to play with but doubt I'll use them much.-The low light pictures I've taken so far are impressive. When I downloaded pictures they were very clean, without any or very little noise even set at the high ISO setting!-Used the batteries that are included and absolutely no problems.-Lenses seem a bit light but balance well on the camera and focus smoothly.Negatives:-The shutter action could be quieter.  This is my biggest complaint.  It's not like everyone will turn around everytime you take a picture but I'd rather not hear it!-The dust reduction feature rattles inside when you turn the camera to its side but I read that was normal as was mentioned by a reviewer. Otherwise I would have thought something was loose inside.-I liked the view finder of the Canon.  I think the information inside is a bit larger.-The Pentax does not have auto focus points that light up when looking through the view finder but to me that doesn't make any difference.  As I said when I pointed at what I intended to point at, it focused right on it, so this to me is a mute point.- It seems a bit slow when first reviewing my picture after each shot but I think that is due to the cheap memory card I'm using.  I'll get another one tonight and expect it to correct the slow process.  If it doesn't, I'll update this review and mention it! Otherwise, assume it was taken care of with a faster card.Overall Impressions:Would I say it feels quite as solid as the Canon?  No, but I really like the Canon!  However, I am still very impressed with the Pentax Kx.  The Pentax isn't quite as thick or wide and I think the size might be most of the difference.  You know you're shooting a SLR and my wife likes it!  For the price, I figure I saved close to $400 over the Canon with similar lenses.  If you want a Nikon or a Canon I'm sure you will be perfectly happy. If you decide to purchase the Pentax you won't be disappointed in this camera either.  It's not the big name of Nikon or Canon but I bet you'll start to see more of Pentax with what all they offer and at the price point it is offered for!  My budget was limited to $1600.00 but of course I was hoping to spend less.  That's a lot of money to spend on a camera and I could have bought up to a higher level camera which I considered but I am comfortable this camera will give me what I'm looking for and saved me quite a bit in the process.  I added a few pictures on flickr that were taken with this camera to give you an idea of the photo quality.  Remember, I'm not a pro, I just enjoy taking pictures.  Go to flickr and search for  scubaguy4409Tips to consider:I suggest when buying online you check the retailer thoroughly.  I searched several sellers on both Google and Bing and found prices from $400.00 to $900+for a Pentax Kx camera kit.  The two low priced sellers I checked on had horrid reviews about shipping and more importantly when I called to ask about their camera packages they were very short with me on the phone.  I don't like to spend anymore than the next guy but i figured if I had a problem with my purchase I would be %$#% out of luck with this guy!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "PENTAX Time!", "Author": "JFSKG \"JFSK\"", "ReviewID": "R17PYDTBFZCNWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seems the time has come for a PENTAX.Being loyal to Canon and loving Nikon DSLRs, I just gave this new camera the chance and think its going to change the top list for the first time.So long, it has been a fight between Canon and Nikon, but now PENTAX got ready to go for it.My decision was made taking into account the price for what you get, and the rivals where Canon Xti and Xsi and Nikon D5000 and D3000, but think this PENTAX kit is a real rival if not better in many features (my case, fps is an issue for my action pictures) and the price of course.Go ahead for it and do not let others make you worry about this choice!March 10th 2010Just an update:So far, my camera is doing great!Some people complained about the AA batteries, so I wanted to state that my camera has not shown any trouble with batteries, maybe because its software is the last version, but aside of that, I just found it works great with Sony AA CYCLE ENERGY batteries: Sony Cycle Energy AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack)When buying, take also into account that the filter for lens 18-55 is a 52mm and the one for the 55-300 is a 58mm.The bag I am using for this camera, both lenses, an aditional fisheye, batteries, and a couple of things more is the Lowepro Adventura 170, which is good on quality, space, and price: Lowepro Adventura 170 Camera Case (Black)", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Buying Decision Possible!", "Author": "J.

Manual focus is truly where it is at, at least for me. If you do not agree, Pentax has plenty of new AF lenses to suit anyone. However, excellent manual focus optics are easy enough to try for much less money than newer lenses of any brand. Nobody..... and I do mean NOBODY else offers the total lens compatibility of millions of vintage lenses available only to Pentax users. This particular camera is one hell of a buy. I had the money to buy a D5000 or D90 if that is what I wanted. When it comes to Image Quality, I feel I bought every bit is much camera without sacrificing any features that were important to me. This camera takes beautiful pictures and I have only scratched the surface of its abilities. The two lens package (18-55 and 55-300) was an unbelievable deal at $643. Amazon delivered the camera WAY ahead of the crazy shipment date they list. Do not hesitate. If you are considering this package, pull the trigger.

ACTUAL EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES ARE SMALL IN THIS CLASS OF CAMERA.Camera reviews are written by experienced professionals with a critical eye and sophisticated evaluation tools. They work hard to find, explain, and magnify nuances.My photo needs & tastes are generally simple ones. This class of camera is priced for people like me, upgrading from a digital point & shoot (P&S;). Professionals expect to spend thousands for a camera body, and thousands for a lens.2. PRICE DIFFERENCES ARE REAL.The Pentax K-X is an above-average, entry-level dslr.You can spend less, and get less performance.Unless you spend significantly more, you will not get better performance.A Nikon D90 and a K-X are both very nice 12mp cameras.BUT- they don't cost the same.3. AA BATTERIES - My Favorite Feature!Some people cringe at the AA batteries in the K-X. I've chased proprietary batteries for my P&S; before. I was drawn to this camera because it has a simple power needs. Who wouldn't prefer an inexpensive, accessible power source, easy to find, at a good price?The Eneloop rechargables are working out very well for me.4. SD CARD - My Next Favorite Feature!I have a bunch of these already, and can easily find more, at a good price.5. LONG KIT LENS - Try to find a kit that includes a 300mm zoom...I wanted a 300mm lens.  The nice K-X kit lens makes friends for Pentax.  The Canon XS 300mm zoom lens seems to be a source of irritation/disappointment for its owners.6. LIVE VIEW - SO WHAT?As useful (to me) as a cigarette lighter in a non-smoker's car. I don't use this feature.Camera focuses faster without it. It works fine, just not a factor for me.7. HD VIDEO - DITTO.If you want to shoot HD video, there are more satisfying ways to accomplish this. This feature is not good enough for the camera to take the place of a dedicated video camera.8. BOUGHT IT A SECOND TIMEThe first K-X camera I bought had a small piece of debris (not dust) on the sensor.Probably user correctable with a bulb blower, probably left over from manufacturing/assembly.(NOTE: The PENTAXIAN on-line user community is a helpful,friendly group.)Opted for Amazon's excellent return for credit process.  FAST EASY with EXCELLENT Results!9. WHY REPURCHASE K-X?When I saw them side by side, I was amazed the K-X was so similar to the Nikon D40. When Amazon confirmed my full refund, I tried to convince myself I really wanted a NIKON after all. I had a chance to re-think ALL of my earlier evaluations, against the backdrop of a dslr price war that produced even better prices on the Canon Rebel XS and the Nikon D3000. There were even new old-stock D40s at great prices. BUT the Pentax K-X was small and friendly like these, with a lot of newer features and many small, incremental, extras. So the final selection was the same as the first time, when I opted for a K-X.10. RELAX.  It is hard to make a \"bad\" dslr selection.Any of the top-selling dslrs are going to do an excellent job for just about any user.New dslr purchasers strongly influence the sales for the cameras listed in each week's \"Top Ten\". They know they have a safe bet if they stick with one of the two dominant brands - Canon or Nikon, etc.When I think about how well the PENTAX K-X is meeting my needs, and how much more I would have paid to get an equivalent Nikon (or Canon) I remain very satisfied with this camera.If you are in the market for an entry level dslr, and you think a Pentax K-X meets your actual photographic needs, you're probably right.Update:The more I use this camera, the better I like it.I got a black one, but there is an amazing array of body colors in the K-X product line.The white one is known as the \"Storm Trooper\" a la Star Wars.The \"feel\" is very good. Control placement seems intuitive.The build quality is very solid.The automatic settings make it easy to take decent pictures right out of the box.The features allow for plenty of growth as your skills change.(Translation- it really does help to read the manual.)The kit lenses (18-55 & 55-300 ) are serving me very well.They may be a trifle better than some other \"kit lenses\".The close up shots are very impressive, and the image colors are satisfying.Only a heavier, more expensive camera can match the combined features of the Pentax K-X.Overall, I am very happy I bought this camera.Post-Post Script July 2010:In the back of my mind, I wanted the 300mm lens for a chance to shoot an occasional airshow and get more satisfying results.  Last week I did just that.  The focus is fast and crisp, and the resolution was wonderful- even at the 10mp setting. Very happy with the results.  Continue to be very happy with the K-X.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Pentax K-x is a giant killer!", "Author": "Edgar_in_Indy", "ReviewID": "RGAMY8SX6V9M4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from my beloved Olympus e-510 DSLR with the 14-42mm and 40-150mm kits lenses in order to get a DSLR with better low-light performance and HD video capabilities. I loved my Olympus, but image quality took a nose-dive at ISO 800, and I liked the idea of having an HD camcorder built into my camera to capture high quality family photos and home videos in one device. I eventually settled on the Pentax K-x after first buying, and then returning, a Canon T2i.I know that the T2i costs almost twice as much as the K-x, and they're not direct competitors, but I think my experience illustrates what a great camera and bargain the K-x is and how, for me at least, it was a giant killer.I initially pre-ordered a T2i for the $900 MSRP after reading the glowing reviews in the press about the 18MP sensor, the high-ISO performance and the killer 1080p video. When I received the T2i, I was surprised by how cheap and plasticky it felt. It's not that the T2i was likely to fall apart, but my Olympus felt and looked like a higher quality camera, even though it was about $200 less than the T2i when I bought it. I realize that the T2i is a Rebel, but for almost $1000, I expected something more solid.Even worse was the Canon 18-55mm kit lens, which felt like a toy compared to my Olympus kit lenses. It looked cheap, and the zoom action felt very cheap, and you could hear plastic-on-plastic as you zoomed in and out. There was no lens hood included, and the optional lens hood was only about an inch deep and looked ridiculous. The front element rotated when auto-focusing, which makes using some filters problematic, and you had to switch off AF to manually make focus adjustments. My Olympus lenses did not rotate the front element, and allowed full time focus override without turning off AF. And build-wise, they looked and felt like a higher end lens. But worst of all, Canon kits lens's optical performance was lacking, rendering the 18MP sensor moot.I could live with the cheap feel of the T2i body and the ugly jelly-bean design, but I came to realize that in order to get a lens that would match the performance of the body, I would need to shell out another $500 or more, and as a hobbyist I just didn't have the budget.The real deal-breaker with the T2i though, was the use of Quicktime format for the HD video. Quicktime is a proprietary Apple video format, and while I must assume it works well on a new Mac, the QT videos often gave PCs problems. I'd read about this from other users, but I figured that with my high-end PCs and my computer knowledge, I would be okay. But both my new Sony Vaio laptop with Windows 7, ATI 4650 graphics and 4GB of RAM and my desktop computer with Windows XP, dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Raptor 10K HDD and nVidia 8800GT graphics would stutter on playback of the 1080p files. And finding affordable programs to edit Quicktime HD video files is another headache. I wasn't about to buy a new Mac just to be able to work with the video from my new camera.So back went the T2i, and my quest for a new camera continued. I was just about to pull the trigger on a Nikon D5000, when I came across the Pentax K-x.The first thing that grabbed my attention was the styling. I thought the red was killer, but I wasn't that brave. And the camera looked dead-sexy in navy blue, but when I saw the white version, I was in love. One thing I liked about my Olympus was that it was something DIFFERENT than all the Nikons and Canon Rebels you see every other parent carrying to school or sports functions. I would often get questions about it from people who didn't realize that Olympus even MADE DSLRs. With this Pentax, I would again have something out of the ordinary.Then I started reading reviews of the K-x. One of the great things about the T2i is the high ISO image quality, and according to the reviews and the sample images I was looking at, the K-x was right there with it.And the K-x also did HD video. There were some limitations, such as 720p and lack of full control over exposure while shooting video, but I didn't really mind since the samples I downloaded looked great, even on my 110\" 1080P home theater projector. And 720p files take less space than 1080p and require less processing power to playback and edit. And best of all, the K-x uses Motion JPEG video format, which plays back great on PCs and is compatible with almost any Windows video editing program. The MJPEG format does use more disk space than the equivalent QT file, but hard drives and SD cards are cheap these days, so it's not a big deal.Another great thing about the K-x is that it has sensor-based image stabilization in the body, so any lens you stick on the camera is stabilized. My Olympus used a similar system, and I was very happy with it. The big advantage is that you can be non-stabilized lenses so they'll be smaller, lighter, and less expensive.I ended up buying the K-x in white with the 18-55mm lens. The K-x looks and feels like a higher quality camera than the T2i, and matches my Olympus in this department. The kit lens is also a very worthy piece of hardware.With the money I saved on the Pentax, I was able to buy the legendary Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, a Pentax 55-300mm zoom lens, and a Sigma speedlight. The flash was new, but I got great deals on the slighty-used lenses on eBay and Craigslist.I've been using the Pentax for a couple months now, and have taken hundreds of pictures. I am absolutely thrilled with the camera and couldn't be happier with the photos and videos I'm getting. The T2i did have just slightly more detail, but other than that I would say the K-x has equal image quality. And the 12MP RAW image files of the K-x are faster to work with than the 18MP files of the T2i and take up much less space on SD cards, so you don't have to worry about filling up nearly as fast.That's not too much negative I can say about the camera. I would like it to have a mini-HDMI port and a standard mini-USB port, and continuous auto-focus would be nice in video mode, but no other DSLR has that yet. Stereo mics would also be nice.I suspect that the image stabilization system may not be as good as the one in my Olympus, but I can't say for sure since my 300mm is longer than the telephoto I had with the Olympus and will therefore be more prone to shake.I get compliments on the Pentax everywhere I go, and it's been a joy to use and own. I could not be happier with my purchase.In the future I'll probably add a Sigma 30mm F1.4 prime and a Sigma 10-20mm ultra-wide zoom to my lens kit.Just for the record, I'm not trying to bash on the T2i. It is an amazing camera that is currently without peer in its price range. But if you're like me and you only have about $1000 to spend, I think you will get much more value by going with a less-expensive but almost-as-capable camera like the K-x, and using the extra money on high quality lenses. My F2.8 constant-aperture lens has been a revolution for me, and I recommend every budding photographer make room in their budget for something similar.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Much Better than Expected", "Author": "Frank Forrest \"Quasar\"", "ReviewID": "R1NP51LH2TV3GN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Search Is On-------------------One of the first things I do before making a major purchase is to comb the Internet for as many user and editorial reviews on the product that I can find. There is an up and down side to this. On one hand you get a nice feel of how good a product may or may not be. On the other hand you can go crazy with TMI (too much information). In my initial search for a good digital camera I gravitated towards the upscale point and shoot ones and purchased one.While I wasn't expecting DSRL results from these upscale P&S; cameras, the performance of these models was less than what I wanted for the price points they were selling at. If it wasn't one thing, it was another that caused some hair-pulling on my part in order to get these models to produce acceptable images. I finally had to bite the bullet and move on to the realm of real DSLRs.I Bite the Bullet-------------------After I decided to make the jump to true DSLR status there were several models that I considered from camera manufacturers such as Nikon, Sony and of course Canon. But lurking in the shadows was the Pentax k-x. Pentax k-x? What was that? After burying myself in Pentax k-x reviews I finally purchased one. With each passing week I become more impressed with this little wonder camera.The Good Stuff----------------Some professional reviewers criticized the menu system of the Pentax k-x as too retro. I found this to be a matter of taste and not a negative. The menus are well thought out and easy to navigate through. Because the menus are so extensive, the simplicity of the menus is just the right approach. The lens, image quality, and lack of ISO noise in the yonder regions of 1600 to 3200 is very good. And if you have a noise removal image feature on your photo editing software, you can remove any of the existing noise. After post processing, you should be pretty happy with results even using ISO 6400. There is also an available 12,800 ISO setting and with some image manipulation and a small print size, you'll be able to capture images in very low light or freeze motion with a high shutter speed.The camera also has some very nice presets related to sharpness of your images, color balance, special image filters, and the ability to shoot in very fast continuous mode. This lens kit (28-55/55-300) fits just about all my zoom needs. I personally purchased the kit from Amazon because of their excellent hassle free return policy. (Note that other vendors will charge you at least a 10% \"restocking fee if you return your purchase. I felt that the extra few dollars in buying my camera was worth it for peace of mind regarding returns. I have never had a problem with Amazon return policies.)Focusing is nice and quick, the viewfinder is relatively bright, and there are a wide range of camera settings from manual to automated scenes and everything in between.Reported Issues-----------------You've probably heard of the infamous \"mirror slap\" problems some owners have reported regarding double images when using shutter speeds between 1/60 to 1/100. I have not experienced this issue at all and this may have been a bug in the earlier versions of the Pentax k-x that were actually related to shake removal (SR) performance or in many cases, user error. Some images that were posted of the mirror slap issues were evidently caused by individuals not having a steady hand when shooting.After some experimentation my take on all of the mirror slap issues are that a good majority may be just user error in not understanding the functions of the Pentax k-x. I was able to duplicate the \"problem\" exactly by having the Pentax k-x set on Auto-scene mode or Program mode. The reported double imaging showed up due to the automatic selection of a slow shutter speed and low pre-selection of an ISO at around 400 or less plus camera movement by me. The issue of double imaging was especially apparent when using high zoom.Bottom line, the camera automatically selects the exposure/shutter speed in Auto Pict and Program modes but the user couldn't hold the camera steady enough, thus producing double imaging. The auto modes can only do so much. You have to figure out the details on whether the auto selections are appropriate and if you need to bump up the ISO, use a tripod or use the manual override, etc. I guess the 5 pound processor in our heads needs to get involved in using the camera too. ;DA lot of coverage has been centered on the Pentax k-x's lack of lighted focus dots in the image view finder. I did not find this to be an issue at all since most of my shooting experience has been with cameras that did not have this function. If knowing your depth of field or focus point is really a deal breaker you can always use the focus optically option to preview the scene. If you have had any experience at all with focusing, you know that using the focus sensor in your head is vital. Even focus dots cannot replace your on-board sensor. Automation is fine, but we don't have to be crippled by it, right? :DConclusion------------There is a camera that is the best choice for each individual. It may be a Nikon, a Canon, Panasonic, Fujifilm, Sony or Pentax. I found that in my case the Pentax k-x is the best match for me. It offers great image quality, excellent high ISO performance, and an easy to use interface. If you are looking for a good, relatively inexpensive DSLR, you may want to put the Pentax k-x on your list of cameras to check out.UPDATE 12.3.2010==================I put the Pentax k-x through a real-life assignment last weekend and the camera performed like a champ. I covered a charity event where there were many vendors and hundreds of visitors in a very large meeting hall. There was sufficient lighting but even so, a flash was needed to brighten up the scenes I was shooting. There were lots of candid product shots.I set the camera on \"Auto-Pict\" mode, set my flash at .7 power, and off I went. All the shots turned out brilliantly and after the end of the day and over 300 shots using the flash at all times, I still had an orange bar (approximately half full charge) left in the camera. I was using PowerEx 2700Mah rechargeable NiMh AAs.Previously I was already impressed by the functionality and creative aspects that the camera would allow a photographer through its low light capabilities and special on-board effects, but after this weekend's photo shoot, it also proved to be an excellent workhorse for general event photography.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hits sweet spot in price/performance/features", "Author": "btsoap", "ReviewID": "R3ECNFO9V9KQUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR; my experience includes years of shooting film SLRs and digital point-and-shoots. After a month of shooting a few hundred photos I'm pleased with the K-x. The kit (body + 18-55mm and 50-300mm DA lenses) is a great package for under $700. The automatic and preprogrammed modes are sufficient for those graduating from point-and-shoot cameras to take good photos immediately. The kit lenses are surprisingly good, and at the bundled price they are a no-brainer.I immediately upgraded the firmware to v1.01 and was happy to discover that the installer included a Mac OS X version, which worked like a charm. I've seen no evidence of the early reported battery problems; I'm using the Sanyo Eneloop 2000 mAh and have not recharged yet.Nothing is perfect, and the K-x does lag a bit in image stabilization in low light, but I suspect others do, too. Since I had experience with different brands of digital cameras I haven't had much difficulty with the interface and layout, but if you're a long-time user of another DSLR brand you'll probably need to practice more.I was originally considering the Micro 4/3 format cameras, but after reading others' reviews of the K-x I decided to go the DSLR route. The K-x is comparatively light and compact, but feels solid, and the performance and features at this price are unmatched.Photo quality has been good to excellent, the most challenging shots I've experienced were macro shots outdoors in the shade, in which a tripod is an absolute necessity.

More reasonably priced than CanonI will upload pictures of both Rebel and K-x next week.If you are in market for a camera that is budget friendly and provides excellent pictures, go for K-x!", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera with fantastic package for beginners.", "Author": "Mac Waran", "ReviewID": "R18KE7T4ZO6X47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first dSLR purchase and I am really happy about my choice.I read several reviews and settled on this fabulous genius camera.For this price $720ish you get 300mm telephoto lens as well.I shot some low light pictures and it came out extremely well.I bought these to go with the camera:Bag: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009R6TA/ref=oss_T15_product52mm UV filter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LMU76I/ref=oss_T15_product52mm CP filter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UE6N74/ref=oss_T15_product58mm UV filter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LMSDNW/ref=oss_T15_product58mm CP filter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UE6N7O/ref=oss_T15_product58mm lens hood: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029Z9QIQ/ref=oss_T15_productUpgrade the firmware, so Sanyo's eneloop batteries are recognized.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best entry level DSLR.....Features comparable to NikkonD90 for half the price", "Author": "Luv Kashyap \"Techie guy\"", "ReviewID": "R3J7QPJQ3OEKRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The entry-level DSLR market is flooded with hype, but the 12.4-megapixel Pentax K-x blasts all of the marketing shenanigans away with an overall awesome performance.

At current pricing, I am convinced it is the best deal out there for an entry-level DSLR - and it has more features than most people could possibly use in a lifetime. The addition of the 55-300mm lens over a base package adds a whole dimension of flexibility and is well worth the premium.Beginning with Consumer Reports and their \"Best Buy\" rating, I read every review and bit of information I could find on the K-x. The praise is universal.Coming from a Canon PowerShot A530, the difference is utterly night and day. Images are stunning, and the responsiveness of the camera makes it possible to get shots that are simply unattainable with a point and shoot. Most of my shooting involves action (dog agility and sledding, sports, etc.). In the time it took the Canon to power up and shoot 1 picture, the K-x can power up, meter, focus, and shoot 15 or 20.Hand held pictures taken in a dimly lit banquet hall without using the flash (ISO 6400) were a big surprise - gorgeous!I think the ability to use any type of AA battery is a huge plus. After more than 1200 shots, I am still milking the supplied set of lithium AAs, but knowing I can get a few hundred shots from standard alkalines in a pinch is reassuring.It's a stretch to find something to complain about, but I'll try. The marketing presentation on the Pentax web site clearly states that this camera has a \"time-lapse\" shooting mode. In fact, it does not. I don't really lament this omission, but the feature might well be added in a future firmware update. Video capability was not a factor in my choice, and given its rather severe limitations, I will reserve it for occasional use.

It is smaller, lighter, and outperforms cameras costing three times as much in low light.If you are a prosumer, about the only drawback I would consider is that the focus points do NOT appear in the viewfinder (only on the LED).The HD video is just 'OK' and something I probably won't use at all on this camera.

The kit lens version of the 55-300 is sharper than the version that I purchased two years ago for quite a bit more.The 18-55mm kit lens is better than average for \"free\" lenses included with basic dSLR kits but really only sharp in a very narrow f stop and focal length range.

Superlative performance inside the church, outside the church, and both inside and outside later that evening at the reception.

Both lenses in the second kit looked used (judging by the threading in the back of the lens), but at this point I did not care as long as the camera worked.  Amazon returns are great!Coming from a point and shoot with a virtually silent shutter, this shutter sounds awfully loud.  Even in comparison to the Nikon F2, the shutter sound is much louder.  Maybe it was because the F2 was used more heavily, it maybe that Pentax is louder in general.The Auto Focus is very slow with Live View.  It focuses out, then in, then finds the correct focus.  I tried the Auto Focus with on the Sony Alpha a500 at Best Buy with Live View and the K-X is downright sluggish in comparison.  With Live View off, it is just as fast as any other entry level dslr.I bought this because I did not want to lug around a camera and video camera.  As of February 2010, this is the only dslr that runs on batteries that can take HD (720p) video.  The sound is monaural, but the videos are clear and smooth.  When Live View is on, there is a hissing/clicking noise that the video picks up.  However, this is not loud enough to disrupt video at your usual family gatherings.  Also, Auto Focus is not available during video recording, you must use Manual Focus.A note about the kit lens: the kit lenses do not have the Quick Shift Focus and the distance scale that are on the stand alone lenses.With all that said, this camera takes clear pictures in the dark.  The 30 second and bulb exposure can almost capture everything your eyes can see in the dark.  This camera can see infrared, so with the infrared filter, you can take some neat and eerie pictures.The menu and user interface is intuitive and easy to understand.  This is a very ergonomical camera.  I have been trying to get lens flares in my pictures, but have yet to succeed.  The coating on the lens do a great job of inhibiting lens flares.In the end, first and foremost this is a camera that takes beautiful pictures and good videos.

I was rummaging around looking for reviews about what was the best entry level DSLR. To my surprise, it was a camera from Pentax, a company which I had never even heard of. Even doing comparison shots to the Canon t2i, the shots looked much better on the K-X. That's not to say the K-X blows away the t2i feature-wise. The t2i has a far superior autofocus (good for action photography), 1080p video recording, and an optical viewfinder (which has been remedied with the K-R). However, using the stock lenses (despite the somewhat sluggish AF), you can still take some very nice photos.The 18-55mm lens covers the average spectrum of zoom you'd find on a P&S;, though it doesn't use any digital zoom (which is very good for image quality). However, the lens optics aren't spectacular. Barrel distortion is noticeable in every shot and the pictures tend to be on the \"soft\" side. That's not to say IQ is worse or equal to a P&S;, but since you are paying a hefty sum of money when compared to a P&S;, you expect a little bit more. The closer you get to the middle between 18mm and 55mm, the better your shots will look (I tend to stick to the 35mm). Overall, it doesn't disappoint as a kit lens.The 55-300mm lens on the other hands is, in my opinion, a gem. Now I don't have any of the fast-primes or limited edition lenses other reviewers may have on here, and I bet in comparison to those lenses this is nothing fancy to them, but to me, a first time DSLR user, this is where high IQ is at. It's almost impossible NOT to take a good photo with this (barring your composition is at least adequate). Being near the Adirondacks, it is great for taking in nature scenes as well as macro photography of the vast amount of flowers and other plant life. Also, it is good for \"unsuspecting\" (not that way, perv) photography. By that, I mean if you have subjects who just can't act naturally while in front of the camera, this allows you to (in an outdoor setting of course... or a fairly large indoor setting) photograph them from a distance so they aren't constantly reminded you are there taking photographs.Again I can't say enough about the image quality of the 55-300mm. Even if it doesn't have the optimal zoom for some situations, I tend to use my feet in conjunction with the zoom to frame my shot just so I can have the IQ from the 55-300mm and not the 18-55mm.If you are like me and can't imagine spending almost as much money on 1 lens as you would on the camera itself, a welcome addition would be the Pentax 21987 DA 35mm f/2.4 AL Lens for Pentax Digital SLR cameras. Since it is a fixed-focal length, you can't manually zoom with it (your feet are the zoom). However, with the f/2.4 you would be able to take shots indoors (with some decent lighting of course) without having to use a flash. Using the flash washes out detail (unless you purchase a separate external flash and direct it at the ceiling instead of your subject) and takes away that edge of using a DSLR vs. a P&S.; Best thing, it's priced around $175.In regards to indoor photography with the stock lenses, unless you are using a tripod or the flash, the exposure time would be too long for hand held use. Keep this in mind if you were planning on taking family photos indoors.One thing I have to knock the K-X for is the positioning and overall fickle nature of the AF/MF switch. Using MF alone with this viewfinder is almost impossible, you can't really tell when the whole image is popping or not (there are 3rd party viewfinder from Spyder Optics which remedies this and can be installed by a local electronics or photo store). So my technique was going to involve using the AF to get a pretty good lock on the subject, and then switching to MF for the final touches (subtle tweaks). That technique is very frustrating with the K-X. The slide is located on the very lower left side of the camera. However, the tab doesn't slide easily, in particular going up from AF to MF. There is a tab at the top which you can put a nail in to move it to AF. Unfortunately, there are no tabs in assisting getting it back up to MF, and as I said before, is already very stiff with the tab. So imagine it without the tab? Quite an annoying oversight.Last but not least is IQ. At the time, compared to Nikon/Canon's entry level offerings, the K-X was the definitive winner. However, the K-R uses the same sensor as the K-X and really didn't make too many advancements. The newer Canon and Nikon models share price points that are similar to the K-X (though more expensive, its normally not by too much). You should check out some sites for comparison shots before you take the plunge on this or any other model.Despite being almost 2 years old, the K-X is a very solid, entry level camera, that is capable of producing excellent images.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome for DSLR beginner to enthusiast", "Author": "direr", "ReviewID": "R2D1CGYDUPIN2Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for the past 2 years now and it has never failed to deliver - whether I am shooting landscapes, portraits or just plain walk-around shots.Just a few of the things I like most:- Value for money - no other camera provides the combination of features, quality and price that the K-x does. At a sub-$700 price you get two extremely good kit lenses (the 55-300 especially is a real gem), class leading low-light capability, in camera HDR, IR remote compatibility (you can easily get a $5 generic IR remote and it will work - has for me), high customizability, etc. etc.- Low-light capability - over 60% of my shots are indoors or in low-light, and the ability to go up to ISO6400 and get extremely usable shots is a boon (add noise reduction and you literally cant tell pics have been taken at those high ISO's, what little noise it introduces is that easily manageable). And combine it with a fast lens and you are clicking away while others are fumbling with their flash, tripod and missing shots.- In-body stabilization - this alone is a big reason I took to Pentax. As you build up your lens kit, you don't need to shell out big bucks for every lens as the in body stabilization means the lens just has to put good glass and the rest is taken care of by the camera. I have been able to take completely shake free shots at 1/5s.- Backward compatibility - the k-mount can take quality lenses from over the last 2-3 decades that Pentax has been making stellar glass. I have the Pentax-M 50mm f1.4 and it is a beauty. And given the in-body stabilization, all the glass is now available with full shake reduction.

However, it's a long time since I started to think about getting more photo-power in my hands.My previous \"super zoom\" camera has a number of weaknesses that became more and more frustrating:* inability to shoot in low light (ISO 400 is the maximum and that is with terrible noise)* slowness - from turning on to being ready to shoot, zoom, focus, frame-to-frame lag, etc., etc.* ergonomics - it is really hard to perform some basic adjustments, while not using the automatic modeAnd, in addition, I wanted to go up a level with the image quality, to preserve good looking memories.Of course, first thought was to go the Canon/Nikon path. But the following considerations outweighed in favor of Pentax K-x:* price for DSLR with two really-not-so-bad lenses* great low light performance* availability of great second hand manual lenses for bargain prices (we are talking about quality here)* in-body image stabilization, making the previous paragraph even more attractiveWell, the camera delivers what it's promised. Getting the pictures I want has become so easier!Pros:* all of the already said* great pictures even in automatic mode, making it easy for \"consumer mode\" usage* absent AF point indication - not an issue, instead, you choose where you want to focus* lightweight* chance of running out of battery power is very low - AA available everywhere* ergonomicsCons:* somewhat problematic focusing in live view mode* no weather sealing - rain together with wind could prevent you from taking the pictures you want (however, no chance to get such a feature in this price range for up to date technology)* Pentax has much smaller market share than Canon/Nikon and even Sony, it could become an issue while looking for lenses, spare parts, services* the LCD is hard to see in direct daylightThe bottom line:Great camera with a great price tag allowing daring amateurs to make a big next step up.I would recommend this device for anyone who doesn't afraid of \"being locked\" in the Pentax niche.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding value, quality, and photos", "Author": "Michael Simpson", "ReviewID": "R1NN0GS5I8WA2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are some great reviews here, so there's not much for me to add, but I'll try.1.  For a DSLR, the price is about the best you can find for a body plus two reasonable zoom lenses.  My nice Nikon plus lenses got destroyed in an accident, so I was looking a replacement using the insurance money.  In fact, I was considering one of the ultra-zoom cameras from Panasonic, Nikon or Canon.  Then I read a comment about this camera, and I decided this was a much better choice for my needs.  I spent too much time in Aperture and Photoshop fixing up P&S; pictures, so I needed to move on.2.  The lenses aren't the best.  You should realize at this price, you're not getting the best lenses in the Pentax armory. But, at this price, I can afford a couple of high quality lenses.  Though there are lots of factors that give you good photographs, I personally think that lenses matter.  I'm shopping for one or two Pentax fixed focal length lenses to add here.3.  Some people complain about the shutter noise.  Let me be a contrarian and say that I like it.  It reminds me of my old Nikon F-5 (yes, a film camera, but there's still something about film).  I like the sound.4.  Like all DSLR's, the menus take some learning.  That being said, it's not that bad, with a short learning curve (at least for me).  I just wish someone would create menus with the simplicity and power of an iPhone.5.  The size is amazingly compact.  Not like the Four Thirds type of cameras, but pretty nice.6.  The CMOS sensor is really sweet.  I've gotten a couple of nice night time shots of the sky!  Too bad I got it too late to take some photos of the Perseid meteor showers.If you're moving into the DSLR range, this is a true find.  I'm not highly experienced, but I think with the right skills, even with the supplied lenses, you would need a mid-range DSLR to get better photos.  And it's WAY better than even the highest priced point and shoots.  I think this is a camera I'm going to use for years.Also, I bought this camera through Amazon Prime (Amazon fulfilled the order).

So I struggled with the decision to get one of the new megazooms with CMOS sensors, like the Fuji HS20 or the Kodak Easyshare Max, or to take the plunge and get a DSLR.I actually did buy the HS20, but found it clunky and awkward to use, and the picture quality was kind of erratic. It was just not enough of an improvement over my Olympus to justify a $500 investment, so I sent it back.A professional photographer advised me to get a DSLR if image quality is my concern. This camera was an easy choice for me because it takes rechargeable AA batteries. I might be in the minority, but I don't want to bother with proprietary rechargeables. I want to be able to walk into a drugstore and pick up some AAs if necessary. And then there was the matter of price - as many reviewers have stated, the K-X offers a huge bang for the buck.Although it's a DSLR, the K-X has been an easier transition from my Olympus in terms of size and weight. It just fits well in my hand. I went with the kit with 18-55mm and 55-300mm lenses, based on the reviews. I've been largely pleased with  both, although the telephoto lens does add some heft to the camera!The same photographer who suggested a DSLR advised me to get a 50mm f/1.7 lens for low-light situations. I found a good used one on eBay for about $130.I am far from a professional photographer, but I have found the leap to a DSLR has not been as traumatic as I feared. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 55-300mm lens goes about the same distance as the Olympus 20x lens - I can still take Manhattan skyline photos from my window. The 18-55mm lens works fine for most shots.The f/1.7 lens has acquitted itself well under a variety of conditions once I figured out how to use it. I have to get used to \"zooming\" by positioning myself in a lot of cases, but I like the results.I bought my K-X from Beach Camera, which was very efficient. I got it the day after I placed the order, and it was well-packaged.

I have been very pleased. I really like having both lenses, because it allows me a vast range of zoom, which is important to me since I like to shoot a lot of nature shots, and many nature shots require a high zoom because subjects do not stay still, nor to they like man to approach very closely. Even people are more easily photographed when you are farther away.I saw in reviews that battery life was short, primarily because live view and flash eat a lot of power. I have turned both off for the majority of my shooting, and have found that the batteries can last for several days of intense photographic experience. I am extremely pleased with the photos that I have been able to take without tripod and in poor lighting. I have had a little difficulty with caves recently, but night seems not to be extremely limiting with natural light, particularly near the city. Moon light is adequate for my purposes.I wish I had a compact case in which I could carry my camera, two lenses, and a spare set of batteries so I could always have fresh batteries on hand when I need them.I was a little disappointed with the movie feature, since it appears that it can not shift focus while shooting video. I have trouble telling whether or not my shot is perfectly focused using the view finder, or even the live view, and I certainly am not skilled yet in shifting focus manually in a smooth way. However, I am sure that practice will help and future models will resolve this problem. I can keep the lenses and use them on future models, so it is not a dismal disappointment.

It would take mostly sharp images at 1/30s, and sharp images at 1/250s.  I also noticed demosaicing artifacts in images as well, although I think that's just the way the camera is.Whether the shake problem is wide-spread, a limited defect, or a design flaw, doesn't matter to me.  I don't want to spend countless hours with Pentax on fixing the problem...if it can be fixed at all.  I just want a camera that can take sharp pictures.  But at this moment, my Canon compact takes sharper images than this K-x.I also decided that optical IS is better than sensor based IS.  With optical IS you get the benefit of the IS system through the viewfinder.  That also means that the autofocus is more accurate, and spot metering in complex lighting is also more accurate.  So I returned my broken K-x and will likely get a Nikon instead.UPDATE 2/28/10A member of the DPReview forum had sent his K-x back to Pentax for this problem.  They replaced the mirror box and did a few other things.  However, he still has the problem.  This is exactly the situation that I didn't want to have to deal with.  The question is now being raised of this possibly being a design flaw.  Another member is now awaiting the return of his K-x.A poll at PentaxForums indicates 70 out of 204 K-x owners have noticed blurred/double images with their K-x... over 34%. (updated 3/30/11)3/17/10 - Imaging Resource now has a full review of the K-x, and they were able to reproduce the shake problem.  Their result was that 1 in 10 shots at 1/100 had the problem.4/3/10 - Second DPR member's K-x was returned without being fixed.  Pentax hasn't admitted to there being any problem.I now have a Nikon D90 that takes equally sharp images at 1/80 as it does at 1/250.  I also noticed that the D90 images aren't quite as sharp as the high-shutter speed K-x images.  I was actually expecting this.  The K-x appears to have either a very weak low-pass filter, or maybe it performs this function in software.  The result is sharper images, but greater chance of false color.  The effect is quite blatant in the Imaging Resource samples for the K-x.  The Samuel Smith label in the still-life sample exhibits false color artifacts in the words \"Pure Brewed\" and \"Lager Beer\" due to the minimal low-pass filtering.  Also, the Nikon D90 actually has a lossy RAW format.
