{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another winner from Canon", "Author": "E. Tam", "ReviewID": "R3MAE1JK5OUCPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my SX260 last Wednesday and have taken about 700 shots and a few quick 5 minute video. Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it's still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it's not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that's very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh's 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you're a previous Canon user, it's a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn't notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won't; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon'sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon's 24/25 fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you're a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it's selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month! I thought cars depreciate quick ...UPDATE 04/18/2012 - The Live Mode works great! For those hard shots (for example, taking indoor picture with fluorescent lighting and without a flash), you can view the screen and make the adjustment right then and there. You look at what you plan to take, compare it to the SX260 LCD screen and press the shutter button.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "This Could Be the One", "Author": "K. S. Bowen \"KS Bowen\"", "ReviewID": "R8IHOGWOFQ909", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an experienced amateur photographer and I've owned many cameras over the past 40 years. I've had some photos published but photography has always been strictly a hobby, though a serious one. I shoot with a Canon 7D, Rebel backup, various 'L' lenses, and I also use an Olympus E-P1 occasionally as well as a Canon S90 and Powershot 1100S (kept in my glovebox for 'emergencies'). I enjoy taking pictures.I also enjoy traveling and have traveled around the states as well as visited many foreign countries. I'm sure I echo the frustrations of every photographer out there when I say that choosing which photo equipment to take on a vacation is the most agonizing process in planning a trip.Let me share two experiences--one pleasant, another frustrating. In 2003, I visited New Zealand and took one of Canon's first digital Powershots. It was very small, fit in my pocket, and I could easily whip it out for quick photos. Even though the pictures were not pristine SLR quality, it was easy and fun using that camera and I still enjoy viewing those photos today. I had a pleasant and memorable trip. Second experience: a 10-day tour of China in 2007. I took a DSLR and 3 lenses as well as an HD camcorder, all in the same shoulder bag. It turned out to be total frustration. Instead of being able to enjoy the moment of seeing all that glorious ancient history and the people of China, I was overly concerned with 'getting the shot' -- all the time. Also, HD video was new in those days and I thought I could record the 'trip of a lifetime' with the latest technology. But switching between video and still photography simply added to my frustration. Although I got quite a few good pictures and videos, I did not enjoy that trip as much as I should have because I let my photo-taking desires get in the way of my vacation needs and cultural immersion. As a matter of fact, my wife used a point-and-shoot to get some great candid photos of people and children that totally outshone my efforts.OK, fast forward to 2012. Like so many other photographers out there, when traveling I need a camera that's pocketable but can do everything. Impossible. It doesn't exist. But I remember the lessons learned from the experiences described above. Concessions must be made. With experience, I've learned what is a necessity, and what 'would be nice to have' when traveling. I have concluded that for me, a camera that takes 'very good' pictures, that is small and lightweight, is a NECESSITY. Anything else would be 'nice to have' but is not worth the enormous hassle.I've had the Powershot SX260 HS for about a week now and I think I may have found the camera that will adequately meet my travel needs. I've shot a couple hundred photos and I'm surprised at the results. They are sharp, contrasty, colorful, noiseless, and good enough to use as desktop pictures on my 24-inch monitor without editing. The 20x lens is coupled to a shake-free technology that is very, very good. It's pocketable and has easy to use buttons that are logically placed. Canon has done their homework in finding the right balance between sharpness and noise, as far as I am concerned. Although it doesn't shoot RAW (that's a debate for another time), I am very happy with the JPEGs and I use the included highlight-taming technology built in to the camera and it works very well.What I like:1) Pocketable. Pocketable. Did I say pocketable?2) Turns on quickly to get the shot.3) 20x lens -- 25mm to 500mm. The 25mm shots are corrected internally for distortion and the 500mm shots are sharp thanks to the IS technology.4) Very good noise control -- I haven't tested it at 1600 or 3200 but several other review sites reveal surprising, low noise photos at those ISO levels.5) My copy is very sharp -- no need to sharpen the photos it produces.6) Color accuracy is on par with my Olympus E-P1, which I consider to be the paragon of color accuracy.7) Full manual when desired.8) Takes very good HD video -- though that doesn't interest me so much these days. IS corrects for camera shake in video mode and zooming works well.What I don't like:Nothing yet, though I will update this review if anything comes up.Does this camera take pictures comparable to my 7D? No. My E-P1? Very close. My S90? Superior to the S90 in my view.The 20x zooming feature of this camera can't be overstated -- it's wonderful.So many reviewers nitpick about technical matters. Sure, I could do that with any camera, including this one. But the point is--what need does the camera serve? All I know is this: If this camera had existed at the time, the SX260 would be the camera I would have taken to China.Highly recommended.[UPDATE: Many people have asked me about the so-called 'squeal' in video mode. When ambient sounds are low, the condenser mic (as in all cameras) boosts the gain. Most cameras will then pick up the internal motor/electronic sounds. This camera is no exception. The noise I've noticed is a very subtle high pitched ring similar to tinnitus. Am I surprised? No. It's the same sound I've heard in every video unit I've owned in the past 25 years. Medium to loud sounds will cause the mic to adjust and the tinnitus disappears. Folks, if video is important, buy a dedicated video camera. This is a PHOTO camera that has video capability, which is what I wanted.]", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "20x Zoom Comparison - Sony HX20; Canon SX260; Panasonic ZS19", "Author": "Artemaria", "ReviewID": "R33NQZMVW4NA2G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I couldn't decide between these three cameras (and their variants, the Sony HX30 and the Panasonic ZX20) because many of the reviews of each made the cameras sound very similar.  So, I went out and bought (from merchants who accepted returns) one of each of these three cameras (I didn't need WI-FI or GPS, so that's how I settled on these less expensive variants).  And then I took photos and videos in various conditions.  I am not a professional photographer, and I didn't do Imatest or any other specific tests on the images (you can read C/net for that), but this is an experience of a regular person who was taking pictures and videos with these three cameras side by side, which is a comparison that you do not often see.The bottom line is that these three cameras are very similar with a few minor differences, but those differences set them apart and may make you decide that you like one more than the other.Generally speaking, NONE of these cameras is a DSLR replacement.  Whomever writes that the pictures are as good as a DSLR is not speaking accurately.  Also, none of the cameras is a replacement for a high end camcorder.OUTSIDE PICTURESIf you are taking pictures outside on a sunny day all of these cameras will take very nice pictures for small to medium enlargements (no bigger than 8 x 10).  The cameras all produce nice fairly sharp images that would be well suited for that purpose.  And, like most people, I don't remember ever enlarging a picture more than 8 x 10, so it is not a common problem.What might be an issue is if you are zoomed in all the way and wanted to crop a photo (which sometimes happens), the differences in the way the cameras' photos look when you \"pixel peep\" might make a difference.  In good light outside, the cameras were close, but the best photos were from the CANON with the SONY and the PANASONIC a close second.INSIDE PICTURES - GOOD LIGHTIf you are inside and you are taking pictures in low light, you will see a different story.  Again, at smaller sized prints 4x6, 5x7, most people will see almost no difference between the pictures of the three cameras other than the PANASONIC's colors are a little less vibrant than those in the CANON and the SONY.  I am not sure whether those colors are less accurate, they are just a little less vivid.If you pixel peep at these pictures, the CANON's photos are clearly the best with the PANASONIC's being second.  The CANON's remain very sharp through a good amount of enlargement while the PANASONIC's, although close, get softer a little faster.  The SONY's pictures inside with good light became soft rather quickly and, I'm not sure if this is because the SONY has 18MP on a small chip (as some of the tech reviewers write), but there is a \"watercolor\" effect where after you enlarge it a little bit, it looks like a Claude Manet painting.INSIDE PICTURES - LOW LIGHTIn poor light, the hierarchy between the cameras remains the same, but there is less of a gap between the CANON and the PANASONIC.  It seems as if the CANON takes somewhat worse pictures in low light, and the PANASONIC just doesn't get that much worse.  As a result, the gap between these two becomes somewhat closer.  The SONY's pictures remain the poorest of the three in low light.VIDEO - OUTSIDE GOOD LIGHTAll three cameras take very nice video outside in good light.  If you are editing or nitpicky, you will note that the SONY and the PANASONIC take 60 frames per second, which is somewhat easier to edit, than the 24 frames per second that the CANON records.  While you have to look for it, the CANON's outside video does have a couple of instances where it seems to be a tad jerky compared to the SONY and PANASONIC's video.  But you really have to look for it and most people won't notice if you don't have another video outside for comparison.While all the outdoor video is close, I would give the edge to the SONY in video, with the PANASONIC second and the CANON third.  But they are close for outside video.VIDEO - INSIDETaking video inside is a different story.  Inside, the SONY shines and clearly has the best video.  The video from this camera is actually good.  It is not professional level by any stretch, but it is good solid quite viewable video from a camera that takes still pictures.There is a noticeable difference on indoor video between the SONY and the PANASONIC.  This difference was perhaps most noticeable to me because I had both videos from both cameras and watched them over and over again looking for differences.  While the difference is noticeable, it is not a tremendous difference.  The SONY video is super smooth and seems to get as much out of the light as it can.  The PANASONIC video also is smooth and gets a good contrast tone and color out of the available light, but is slightly less smooth than the SONY.  The PANASONIC video is still very viewable and looks good, but not as good as the SONY.The CANON will take decent indoor video in good light, but in poor light, it just seems to struggle.  The CANON's video had many shadows and dark areas that simply were not present in the SONY and PANASONIC videos.  I did not notice any hissing in the CANON video as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  This may be an issue that varies from camera to camera.HANDLING AND SPEEDThis was a fairly subjective comparison between the three cameras as to how they felt in the hand and how quickly the camera did what I wanted it to do because if the camera doesn't take the shot when you want to, it doesn't really matter how sharp the picture or video might be.Based on my experience, the PANASONIC had the best handling of the three.  While the PANASONIC and the SONY were both quick to take a picture, for some reason the SONY that I had would take a much longer time (seconds) to record the picture onto the card.  This was despite the fact that both cameras had comparable cards with comparable write speeds.  Both the SONY and the PANASONIC had rather quick autofocus which also made them seem to react faster.  The PANASONIC is noticeably thinner and lighter than the SONY while maintaining a similar full raised rubber grip on the front which made the camera easier to handle.  While both the SONY and the PANASONIC were quick, the blazingly fast (by comparison) write speeds on the PANASONIC compared with its almost non-existent shutter lag made this the best handling camera of the three by far.Even though it consistently took the best pictures, the CANON was the worst handling camera.  The autofocus often had issues focusing and there was a constant shutter lag while it was searching for its focus.  We did miss some shots because the CANON was so slow to react.  Also, the CANON is somewhere in weight between the SONY and the PANASONIC, but has the worst grip of the three.  That little rubber strip on the front is not as effective a grip as the fuller grip that appears on the SONY and the PANASONIC.With respect to handling, I've read many reviews and each of them seems to state different things about each of the cameras.  Many of these reviews seem to indicate that the SONY is a very fast camera, and that might be the case, but the write speed of the 18 MP pictures (which are 50% larger than the CANON's photos and almost the same for the PANASONIC) was so slow, it was distracting and detracted from the experience of using the camera.VERDICT AND CONCLUSIONSNone of these cameras is the best at everything.  The CANON has the best pictures, but is slow to focus, somewhat awkward to handle and has the worst video of the three.  The SONY handles okay but is heavy and has noticeably slow write speeds, its picture quality varies greatly with the light (and will deteriorate rapidly with any significant cropping) but the SONY has the best video, and it is noticeable.In the end I decided to go with the PANASONIC.  While it only was the best in handling, to me that was a significant portion of the photographic experience.  It is not DSLR fast (instantaneous), but it is a zippy camera for a superzoom, is light in weight and has a good grip which makes it easier to hold.  Also, it does not have a pop-up flash which I found always seemed to come up under my fingers where I was holding the left side camera.  As noted above, the PANASONIC's videos were good, perhaps not as good as the SONY, but the PANASONIC was certainly capable of capturing some nice video, even in low light.  The photos also were not as good as the CANON's, but they were close and very close in low light.  With respect to the vibrancy of the colors, if you set the photo vibrancy on the PANASONIC to \"happy\" (which I guess is their \"vivid\") it is less of a noticeable difference.  The photos look very nice and certainly are competitive in quality for this type of camera.Hopefully this comparison and these observations will help you decide between these three similar cameras so you can choose the best one for your needs.  Good luck.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera! Very impressive", "Author": "N V", "ReviewID": "RGQJ55KNJMQKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon SX260 HS: I'm happy to say that I was one of the first people to buy this camera. I bought it from one of the sellers on Amazon Marketplace, before it was officially released (it wasn't even available on amazon.com itself when I bought it).It's a good camera & quality clear pictures, with a clear & sharp LCD screen.The camera has the option of changing the aspect ratio for the pictures; you could choose from 16:9, 4:3, 3:2 & 1:1. You could also change the amount of recording pixels from L, M1, M2 & S. In auto mode, it has many predefined scenes. The camera could also be set to various scene modes, including portrait, Smooth skin, smart shutter, High-speed Burst HQ, Handheld night scene, low light, underwater, snow, fireworks, discreet & stitch assist. It does not have the scene modes for Kids & pets, foliage or beach, which other Canon powershot cameras have, but I don't think that would make a big difference, as it takes great pictures anyway. It also has creative filters which I haven't yet used, including fish-eye effect, miniature effect, toy camera effect, soft focus, monochrome, super vivid, poster effect, color accent & color swap. It has the movie digest feature & face ID. It also features continuous shooting.In manual mode, there are many different options, including setting the ISO speed (speeds available: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 & 3200), flash output, changing the compression between fine & superfine (superfine is not available in Auto mode, but is available in P mode), white balance (settings available: auto, daylight, cloudy, tungsten, fluorescent, fluorescent H, underwater & custom), my colors (including: vivid, neutral, sepia, B/W, film, lighter & darker skin tone, vivid blue, vivid green, vivid red & custom) & light metering. Manual mode has the option to have the flash forced on (forced flash is not available in auto mode, but is available in P mode). You can also set the shutter speed anywhere between 1/3200 of a second & 15 seconds (with speeds slower than 1.3 seconds, ISO speed is set at 100). Aperture value could be set anywhere between f/3.5 & f/8.0, but it also depends on the zoom position (with maximum zoom, aperture value could be set either at f/6.8 or at f/8.0).There is also a P mode, where various functions can be set. (Many of the options available in manaual mode are available in P mode also, including forced flash). I'm not here to describe every detail of the camera, as there are many more functions available as well (including setting the focus & exposure, plus some more that I haven't yet figured out), but for those that would like to know everything prior to buying the camera, they could go to Canon's website - [...] (find the camera, click on brochures & manuals) & download the complete user guide.Movies: Good quality with very clear sound. Optical zoom could be used for movies (& the sound of the zoom during the movie is extremely faint, not like some of the previous canon powershots). Options available are: Full HD (1920 x 1080, 24 fps), HD (1280 x 720, 30 fps) & VGA (640 x 480, 30 fps). Maximum clip length is approx 30 minutes for Full HD & HD, & approx an hour for VGA (or until the memory card is full). Movie format is .MOV. It also has iFrame (1280 x 720), & super slow motion (640 x 480, 120 fps, or 320 x 240, 240 fps). Please note since the primary function of this camera is for stills (as this is not a camcorder), therefore when you shoot a movie, it uses quite a lot of memory & the files will be very big. On an 8GB memory card: Full HD will be approx 30 minutes, HD - approx 42 minutes & VGA - approx 1 hour & 28 minutes, whereas on a camcorder, for the same amount of memory, the shooting time could be much longer, even in HD. But for shooting small clips here & there, it's very good.Zoom: zoom is very good - 20x zoom. It zooms quickly. Wide angle is 25mm which is very good & for some pictures you might want to zoom in a bit; otherwise it might be a bit too wide. In full maximum zoom, you may want to use a tripod; otherwise it might take some time to focus (but you could get good pictures even without a tripod). I found that in full maximum zoom (indoors), auto mode might not get the right ISO speeds etc. & you might need to use some manual settings, but that shouldn't be a big problem (plus you don't have to always use the full maximum zoom).Playback: It has some cool features for playback, including giving you various transitions between pictures (fade, slide or scroll), or watch them in a slide show on the camera. Erasing pictures is very easy; you do not need to go into the menu to erase pictures. You could also organize pictures in categories, or set-up a photo book. It has red-eye correction in shooting mode & in playback. You can also trim pictures or resize them in playback.Camera body: I find that the camera is very solid; the door for the memory card & battery compartment is sturdy, though the cover for the (AV & HDMI) terminals is flexible. The tripod socket is metal. The feel of the camera is smooth & it has a rubber grip on the front. In the USA, this camera is available in three colors; black, red & green. In other countries it's also available in dark silver; I don't know why this color is not available in the US.GPS: I have not yet used the GPS, so I can't give any info on that. In other countries, Canon also makes the \"Powershot SX240 HS\". The difference between the SX240 & the SX260 is that the SX240 does not have the GPS feature, whereas the SX260 has the GPS feature. The SX240 HS is not available in the USA.Flash: The flash is a pop-up flash. Some people might think this is not convenient. However it's ok & it's more convenient than the previous model, the SX230 HS. In the SX230, the flash takes up the entire depth of the camera; therefore there's almost nowhere to place your left finger. In this model however, the flash only takes up half the depth of the camera, enabling one to place their left finger behind the flash. The flash does not pop up automatically every time you turn on the camera. It pops up (in Auto-flash) when it determines that it needs to use the flash, or when you set the flash to (forced) on. If your finger is stopping the flash from popping up properly, it might tell you to power-off the camera & then to power-on, in order to be able to pop-up completely. After a while of using the camera, you should get used to the pop-up flash.Software: I have not yet used the software on my computer, so I can't say anything about it. But you can still connect the camera to a computer (via the USB cable) even without installing the software.Included in the box are: The camera SX260 HS, Battery NB-6L, Battery charger CB-2LY, Wrist Strap WS-DC11, USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU & the Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM.The camera comes with a printed version of the \"Getting Started\" guide. The complete \"User Guide\" is to be found on the disk that comes with the camera (together with the software), or it could be downloaded from[...] . If you would like to get product updates from canon, you could register your camera on usa.canon.com .For those who are aware of differences in other Canon models between being made in Japan or in China, the camera that I purchased was made in Japan, & the battery & battery charger were made in China.Memory Card: The memory card of a camera is like the processor of a computer. The faster the memory card, the faster the camera. Canon recommends a \"Class 6 or Higher Memory Card\". I got the SanDisk Ultra Class 10 Memory Card 16GB Sandisk SDSDU-016G-A11 16GB Ultra SDHC UHS-I Card 30MB/s (Class 10). It's also available in 32GB & 64GB (The 64GB is SDXC, not SDHC). Please note: if your memory card is SDHC or SDXC, make sure you have a card reader that could read those types of cards, as some card readers only read SD cards, but not SDHC & SDXC (or it might not support a certain class speed). (You might be interested in the SanDisk USB 3.0 card reader that I purchased SanDisk ImageMate All-in-One USB 3.0 Flash Memory Card Reader (SDDR289A20)). But even if you don't have such a reader, you can still connect the camera to a computer via the USB cable (even without installing the software).Camera Case: Personally I prefer a case with a flap opening (as opposed to a zipper opening) together with a shoulder strap. The Canon cases do not have a shoulder strap. For my previous model, I had the Lowepro rezo 10. For the size of this camera, the Lowepro cases that were big enough have zipper openings. So I searched for a case. Eventually I came across the Tamrac cases. First I tried the Tamrac 3819 Case, but it was extremely tight. So I got the next size - the Tamrac 3821 Tamrac 3821 Neo's Digital 21 Camera Bag (Black), & it fits perfectly. (It's available in 4 colors; black, red, green & rust). It has a Velcro opening, small pocket (but make sure nothing falls out) a belt loop & an extendable shoulder strap.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect travel camera!", "Author": "Lee", "ReviewID": "R3CTGBHCWR3ZW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a full month before it was released on Amazon for an upcoming trip to southeast asia. As luck would have it, it arrived the day before my flight took off. I've had good luck with Canon cameras in the past and their picture quality is among the best. The SX260 caught my interest mainly because of the 20x zoom. There are already a couple of reviews going into detail about all of the features so I won't be redundant. Just let me say that there are more features than you will probably use. I will play around with the myriad of shooting modes from time to time, but mostly I will do 99% of my shooting in P mode, tweaking settings as I desire on the fly. I love the GPS feature; I will keep it permanently on so that all of my pics are geo-tagged. The Canon imagebrowser software that comes with the camera will show you the exact location on Google earth where the pic was taken. Pretty cool! I used the movie digest feature during my trip and like it very much. The camera will record three second snippets of video before each pic is taken then stitch them all together into one video. Again, pretty cool! The battery life was a major complaint on the previous model SX230. I did not have any battery life issues with this camera, but then again, I only take about 50 to 60 pictures in a day. I spent several days exploring the Khmer temples in Cambodia, taking my 50 to 60 pictures and at the end of the day the battery level indicator was at half.  If you take a lot of pics then you may want an extra battery. With my shooting style, the battery life is fine. The picture quality is excellent. The somewhat slow lens gave me a little pause when I was making a purchasing decision, but it turns out that the CMOS sensor coupled with the HS system more than makes up for it. Turns out this camera is the best low-light performer I have had. I love the zoom. 20x optical plus 4x digital means a full 80x. I took a lot of pics at 80x during my trip and was pleased with the results. Even at 80x, the image stabilization was able to give me a clear pic in full sunlight. I found that I needed to steady myself in lower light to get a clear shot which is to be expected. The camera feels sturdy and has a nice \"heft\" for its size. I did drop it twice onto solid concrete (not like me at all) during my trip with no ill effects, thank God. So I guess it is solidly built inside as well. My only gripe with this camera is the very annoying location of the flash. It pops up where you naturally want to put your finger. Many times, my finger was in the way when it tried to pop up and it \"jammed\" causing an error message that said to turn the camera off and then back on. That always corrected it but I was afraid I would eventually cause it to break. I considered downgrading the rating to four stars because of this but eventually I trained myself to place my finger behind where the flash pops up and no longer do I have any issues with this.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "best camera you can buy under $700", "Author": "Erick", "ReviewID": "R13SOORZWWLVHT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best camera you can buy at this price.

Please go to a huge retail store and play with this camera and compare it to all others, you'll see it's the best camera out now based on specs, design and performance.  I also have a nikon s9100 which is slightly inferior to this camera in both design (accidentally turns on all the time) and performance(and we all know its either canon or nikon for best photos). Please read the cnet reviews and and any other reviews on this camera. Compact megazooms are taking over. Any review you read will be comparing this camera's performance to a thousand dollar SLR set up. I print flawless 8x10 pictures with this camera. Save your money and buy this camera because the best camera is the one you have on you.

We have owned the S95 for the past 2 years and really liked the camera but we wanted to get another camera as a backup and also to get one with a higher optical zoom. We tested both cameras in multiple situations on the trip and came to the conclusion that the S95 takes better night shots but the SX260 takes better shots in the day and the 20X optical zoom is extremely useful. The S95 allows you to go full manual but the SX260 gives you many options to play with your photo taking. Overall, if I could only take one camera I would take the SX260 because the optical zoom and picture quality is great. The night photos were pretty good too but not as good as the S95 (obviously if you are planning on taking more night shots, then the S95/100 would probably be better for you).

I come from the SLR film days and needed something that would provide full manual (just enough) controls that would allow me to tweak settings if I wished.  This camera is a 90% fit for me in this regard.  No use having all of the bells and whistles and not be able to grab it and carry it along and end up missing the shot.  There are compromises, notably some quality, for the convenience.  If all you end up printing on is letter sized photo paper, you'll be fine.  I use a Canon Pixma 980 and the results are as good as my SLR stuff from 25 years ago, all instantly, compared to those days.  Take the time and go through the manual (it's a pity that it only comes in pdf format) it is really worth it.  That being said, it's a lot to digest in one go, so give yourself some time to work through the features (and there are many).  Seems that each setting has some gems buried in sub-layers of settings.  Unless you clearly understand the basics and what the terms mean, it can get quite intimidating.  The auto modes do work well though, and if you understand the impact of high ISO, various shutter speeds and aperture values, you can always tweak things yourself.  The bottom line is that it does a fine job of both auto and manual shots.  The wide to superzoom is really great, and combined with some really good low/natural light capabilities, this camera is lots of fun.  The most confusing thing for me when I first held it was \"where do I hold it?\" It's so small, that I really do not know where to place my fingers at times, but the metal feel is sturdy.  The flash can be a bit annoying sometimes, but I've worked that out by mainly shooting in \"auto\" and setting \"no flash\" until I do really need it.  The GPS feature is handy, but I would not use it unless travelling around.  Get lots of spare batteries, you'll need them, as battery life is not too good.  Also get a good case, as the lens can be easily damaged.  There is lots more that I can say about this camera, nearly all good; but I'll leave it here for now.  P.S. Do not be afraid of the digital zoom, this one can actually get a really far off shot if necessary, and the blur is understandable, but tolerable.July 17th 2012 Update:Still loving this camera. Pay attention to all of the features and experiment with P settings. Keep ISO at around 200 and you will get the sharpest pics, although the high ISOs in low light on Auto does do a pretty good job. The camera has what it takes if you care to take the time and learn how to use its many features. Sometimes a bit daunting for the point and shoot person, but nice to know that manual settings are there when you feel to push your photography skills a bit further.October 3rd 2012:It has been six months now, and this camera does not disappoint ....period.

One of my criteria is that the camera must be one I can carry in my pants or jacket pocket so it's always ready, but still high quality enough to take excellent photos and videos, be versatile, and have a processor that allows me to take good shots without a flash in places such as museums, cathedrals, castles, and other interior sites.  Most of cameras have been Canons, and they have performed well.  Based on reviews in camera mags, I bought the Canon SX260 this fall, as I thought its amazing 20x optical zoom, new processor, stabilizer, and wide angle lens would make it ideal for travel photos.  At only $270 from Amazon, it was well below the big SLRs and other cameras I saw advertised, but would still be in-the-pocket ready.  We have just returned from a two-week tour of Scotland- lots of lakes (lochs), the highlands, historic sites - a real test for any camera. In every respect, the Canon 260 lived up to its claims, and, in my opinion, may be the best camera for travelers on the market.  The 20x zoom, over and over, allowed my to get shots of scenery, people, castle and cathedral interiors that would have been impossible before.  The amazing processor \"gathered\" light in even very dim places,so I never had to use a flash once; I turned in off on the first day of the tour and never needed it for two weeks!  And - a small but appreciated detail -- in every Canon before, if you turned the flash off for a shot, the next time you turned on the camera, it defaulted to flash on, making you turn it off over and over.  With the 260, if you turn it off, it stays off until you change it - a big time saver.  I was even able to take night shots of the  lights and harbor at Oban- no flash, handheld and stabilized.  The improved video controls on the back make that job easier as well.  Although a bit larger by about 1/4\" and a bit heavier by about 1 1/2oz, it is still easily an in-the-pocket, ready to go camera for any trip or occasion.

I shot a quick video with both using the same SD card. There is definitely a sound difference. My SX230 sound is totally clear. On the SX260 it's not a squeal like the other posts, but an evident equipment hiss during playback. I'm going to try another SX260 and compare. I don't mind a subtle sound as long as it does not cover up my video subject sounds.UPDATE:The second SX260 DID have the so-called \"squeal.\" Again, my first one only had a hiss (kind of like air), but not the squeal. The second SX260 had the squeal for certain. I can see how others are annoyed by the squeal. I know this is a camera and not a camcorder, however there are those precious moments that need to be shot by video from time to time. My decision will be to keep the hissing SX260 or my quiet SX230. The squealing SX260 is going back.UPDATE II (5/17/12):After trying 4 of these cameras, I found one that did not squeal! It was worth the extra time and effort as I truly enjoy this camera and will give my SX230 to my daughter now. I find myself using my SX260 more than my S100 and my SX40.

You just pull it out of your pocket or bag and go. I bought this camera to replace a Canon PowerShot SX210 IS which I bought a couple of years ago and was never really happy with. It took fairly good pictures, but somehow was not that fun to use. The SX 260 was the perfect replacement. It's basically an update of the older model, but in my opinion, is a vast improvement. The pictures look much better to me, and I rarely use anything but the Auto modes and presets. The combination of 20x zoom and great image stabilization get fantastic shots. We were recently in New Orleans for JazzFest and took a lot of pictures far from the stage, zoomed in to a single performer and I was shocked by how good the images were. It was daylight, so take that into consideration. It also is very quick to be ready to take multiple shots without waiting a long time. The wide angle shots also look better to me, as the SX210 seem to blur those shots considerably at the edges. I mostly use presets for certain conditions, like low-light shots, as opposed to effects, but they all seem to work well if you're into that. The video looks ok, but we don't shoot much. My wife and I typically take hundreds of pictures when we go on trips and have been since the days of film. We never bothered with a film SLR either, but when we look at shots from the film point and shoot days, there is no comparison. Digital wins hands-down, especially on this camera. Often many of the shots we take are multiples of the same scene to make sure we get at least one good one. (We sure didn't do THAT in the film days!) With this camera, we usually have more than one good one from a single series and it's even harder to decide on a keeper. If you are looking for a great quality replacement or improvement from your current digital point and shoot, or an alternative to your SLR, this camera deserves your attention. After around half a dozen digital point and shoots over the years, I feel like I finally found one that measures up.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Travel Camera! BUT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE VIDEO", "Author": "Bruce A. Moon \"ESLBruce\"", "ReviewID": "R125234EBSOZ9Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am revising my review because I just returned the camera to Canon. On reviewing the videos taken in quiet rooms, I found that I had clicks and whirs. Perhaps it is something about the autofocus mechanism but a properly designed microphone shouldn't be picking up internal sounds.The quality of the video, apart from the sound, is excellent. The camera's performance indoors in situations like museums and restaurants is great. The AWB is not as good as the one on the Nikon S8100 (but the lens mechanism seems to be better than Nikon's, which failed). The zoom and image stabilization are fantastic for both video and stills. I am hoping that Canon gives corrects the problem because as a travel camera, having this much zoom and quality of video in a pocket-size package is great. If they can fix the sound problem, I'll change the review back to the 5 star I first gave it.Here's the rest of original review:I just got the camera yesterday so I haven't gone anywhere. How can I say it's a great travel camera?  Last summer I traveled for 30 days in China, carrying a backpack, roller bag, and a ScottEVest. As much as I would love to take an SLR, the weight of the camera and lenses I would need, plus being alone with a prominent camera, make taking an SLR impractical and unwise.  I was very happy with the NIkon S8100, but I went through two of them (scratched lens on the first; \"lens error\" on the second. After reading other's experiences trying to get Nikon, I decided to  come back to Canon. I looked the Sony travel zooms too and they looked like excellent choices, but I have had good luck with Canon.While I had glanced at the manual online, once the camera arrived, I wanted to start shooting right away. I didn't wait to  give the battery a full charge. The controls are fairly intuitive (finding the scene modes takes  a bit of practice). The Auto and Easy focus modes work great (I need to read up on the difference; apparently you can easily change settings in the Easy mode, but I have only turned off the flash.). Reviews of the SX230 had complained about the flash automatically popping up and the position. When you are out of the Easy mode, the flash stays down even after you turn it off. In the Easy mode, it pops up after you turn it off if it needs light.The default for the GPS is apparently off when it comes out of the box. When I found I had no GPS data (there's map software that uses Google Maps), I turned it on and took more pictures outside. The SX230 reviews had complained that  the camera often wouldn't shoot if it didn't have a GPS fix. I didn't experience that, but I also have an acre and clear shot of the sky. When I checked the track log in the software, I found that at the closest zoom level I had a track that showed all of my wanderings around my yard. iPhoto picked up the location data without any problem. Pictures in Picasa showed the precise location but the default setting hides the location so you don't have to worry about your privacy if you wish to hide it. With the proper setting in Flickr, you get a nice map of the locations in your uploads with precise locations you never even heard of. iy home shows up with the name of the subdivision plot. The only other place I have seen that is on my property deed and the county assessor maps.. I have both a Mac and a PC; there are versions of the software for both. However, I probably won't be using it since I use Lightroom and iPhoto. Both the Mac and the PC had no problem recognizing the camera and transferring the pictures.I tried a few of the scene and effect modes and they seem to work fine. The Supervivid gave a very impressive brightly colored picture of my neighbor's field and horses (see my uploaded images). The \"fisheye\" worked as expected. I shot some  \"Very Low Light\" pictures and the camera worked well even though I didn't use a tripod; however, the version that showed up when I tried to upload it to the Amazon gallery didn't show a tree caught in the moonlight. I guess that was because of the compression.The video mode works fine and is accessible with a red record button so you don't have to dial up the video setting which is on the dial. The microphone is very sensitive. I could hear the cars  passing on the street 150 yards away (we don't have any buildings between the road and us that dampens the sound). HOWEVER, you can also hear the zoom motor sometimes so if  you are going to make video, it would be best to shoot, stop the shot, zoom in or out, and then shoot again. You can see some of the video in my Flickr photostream; I am eslbruce. Of course, when you zoom  at the extreme ranges, you do get camera jerking and moving when you are just holding the camera with your hands.I have ordered three extra aftermarket batteries and a charger for my travels. I expect the GPS to drain the battery; hopefully , four batteries will do the trick. In an unusual setting like the Forbidden City or Summer Palace in Beijing, I can easily shoot over 1000 pictures in a day. One review said they got 300 shots from the camera using flash half the time; I am not sure they had the GPS on though.The choices of size of pictures leap from 12mpxl to 6 mpxl for medium. I would prefer 8, but 6 mpxl would still be plenty large enough for a 5x8. The camera comes with no SD card; I ordered four of the AmazonBasic Type 6 SD cards for less than $9 each. It handles the HD video fine with no stuttering or buffer overrun.This review is after less than 24 hours.

The photos in the wide-angle range of 25mm to 35mm are superior in quality to those taken with my Nikon and Minolta wide angle lenses that sold for twice the price of this camera. The lens is especially sharp in the 50mm to 150mm range where most photos are taken. And, surprisingly, the long-range photos in the 300mm to 500mm can be superb if you take the time to carefully steady the camera and lock in a precise focus.The stabilization mode enables you to take good photos at 500mm without a tripod, although supporting your hands on a railing or other support will increase the percentage of sharp pictures. The Canon will focus quickly at 500mm in bright sun light, but in hazy, or cloudy conditions, it may take a few seconds to lock in a precise focus.In the \"old days\", we used a heavy duty tripod and a magnifying eyepiece to get sharp photos at 500mm. So, I don't mind the fact that the Canon sometimes takes five or six seconds to get a precise focus lock on long range subjects...beats carrying a five pound tripod and two pound telephoto lens.The Canon's many manual modes permit getting exactly the photo you want, although studying the full 240 page manual, and reading Burian's \"Canon Powershot G12\" Guide will help you learn how to unlock all of the powerful features of the SX260. And, you can put the Canon into the \"easy mode\" with the red heart symbol, hand it to a ten year old, and most of the photos will turn out great.I prefer to use manual mode, with the ISO locked at ISO 100, and the aperture set near f/4 for the sharpest results. Under cloudy/hazy conditions, I use ISO 400 and I found that an 8 x 10 enlargement from the ISO 400 photos look just as sharp as an 8 x 10 enlargement from a ISO 100 photo. The quality of 8 x 10 enlargements at ISO 800 are noticeably lower, which is why I don't like using the Canon's auto modes...the auto modes often select ISO 800 when ISO 400 would be a much better choice.The SX260 has a \"Live\" mode that enabled me to take a photo I've struggled with for years. A building in my neighborhood has a facade that mixes white stone with gold stone, and brown stone. I've taken photos of it with about six different cameras and every possible setting. At best, I can get the color and tone of two of the three colors of stone just right, but never all three.The \"live\" mode puts an image of the building on the screen and then lets me move three sliders for the color balance, brightness, and color saturation. Just keep moving the sliders until the image on the camera's screen has all three sets of stone precisely the correct color, then take the picture. The photo will be perfect.The power of the \"live\" mode is that you are not chosing a \"sunny\" color balance or a \"shade\" color balance...the slider lets you dial in a precise color balance that may be somewhere between \"sunny\" and \"shade\". Likewise, the color saturation slider lets you get colors that are stronger than \"neutral\", but not as strong as \"vivid\". The live mode is easier to use than to describe, but the bottom line is: you will be able to get a perfect photo of any subject, no matter how challenging.Flash photos are mediocre.  I get better results indoors by using ISO 400 and keeping the flash off.  The \"custom\" white balance feature makes it possible to reproduce a candle lighted dinner or a Klieg lighted rock concert.The SX260 is the smallest and lightest camera with a 25mm to 500mm zoom lens that provides full manual modes. It is the best light weight travel camera on the market selling for anything close to its price. I suspect more than a few pros will have one in their bag.If you want to be able to enjoy the full power of the SX260, buy Burian's \"Canon Powershot G12\" guide. The SX260 and G12 share most of their key features, although some features have different names.

Do not underestimate this noise, it will ruin your wedding video for sure or any video shot in a semi-quiet environment.  Shame on Canon for not issuing a recall. Sadly there is no way to test the cameras been sold on internet stores and they are not easy to return.Also the battery life on this camera is dismal even if you are not using the GPS function or autofocus mode, if you turn the GPS you will be lucky if you get 200 pictures with one charge. Another annoying quirk is that this camera does not create automatic Panoramic photographs, it simply does not stitch them together, that is just plain dumb.UPDATE: I exchanged the defective Canon SX260 for the same model, the new camera produces no high pitch noise but the Canon SX260 still introduces an unusually loud white noise, sounds like a \"waterfall\" on the background, it is always there, even when there is music or dialogue. It never goes away. Compared to my Sony Cybershot, the Canon SX260 background noise is easily twice as loud what it should be.

I have revised the star rating to match, though I'm not convinced it's gone...Let me preface by saying that I've been buying and recommending Canon digitals for over 10 years. In fact I still have my old silver PowerShot S60 stowed away in my drawer, and the SX260 HS is probably our 9th Canon. I'm starting to wonder if that's actually a GOOD sign or not, as the longevity of every new model seems to suffer...After our SX230 began putting out more and more WEIRDLY colored photos in P-Auto mode (in full, healthy sunlight no less where Canons have always shined), we started shopping other brands. There's a lot of good cameras out there but between the Nikon's noise, and the Sony's dull brown colors we always returned what we had and waited for the next in the SX series.Now that we have it, my wife has been really happy with the photo quality in most situations, however the AUTO mode which advertises as being \"so intelligent\" misses the mark on MANY occasions. Especially around kids and low light. Every kids photo comes out blurry, so inevitably I return to P mode and manually up the ISO or force the flash to compensate.The video of the last couple generations has been fantastic in HD, although there is a bit of ambient audio hiss in this model which we don't notice in our older videos.On average though, I can recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a Stinker", "Author": "KB \"KB\"", "ReviewID": "R2UWXZQNM5TVDX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am so disappointed with this camera. I purchased it after reading the hundreds of glowing reviews  and found it to be an abysmal choice for my family. I guess if you were only shooting landscapes in brilliant sunlight, it might be an acceptable camera, but for capturing two young kids and the joy of Christmas it is a horrid choice.There's not a single photo of people that doesn't have some blurring in the photo. The auto focus function is very slow and randomly locks on to various spots in the frame. It makes trying to a photo more like trying to play a very frustrating video game, better fire when the sights are on the correct target, because who knows how long before it jumps to the next one. Many of the photos of the kids were missing one thing.... the kids, this camera is so laggy that they were often out of the frame by the time the camera decided to release the shutter. Forget about getting another shot off to make up for the one you missed, as the write time (even to a class 10 card) also seems excessive.I purchased this camera to replace a 6 year old Canon Powershot ELPH SD600 - now that is a fantastic camera. In fact, we gave that camera to our seven year old daughter and the photos that she took are so much clearer and in focus than those taken with the SX260. Even the photos I took with my iPhone 5 are better, since I could focus reliably. I've never seen a camera that focused so poorly. After I realized that the photo quality was so bad, I began testing and took multiple shots from the same location within a few seconds of each other. The focus point would change betwen these shots and result in wildly varied pictures. The one thing that I noticed was that on highly zoomed shots of inanimate objects, the focus was much sharper and more what I expected from this camera.Even though I purchased the camera to use for pickup and shoot pictures, I did try to experiment with the various settings and took the camera off Auto mode. I got better shots using AV or TV mode, but even then the shots were just plain bad. It seems that there's something off with the flash (in addition to the horrid placement, more on that later) it didn't freeze motion like I'm used to with other cameras. Even flash photos are very blurry if there is any motion.And speaking of the flash, it is like a jack-in-the-box that pops up, right where your fingers naturally rest, at the most in opportune times. This either shocks and makes you miss your shot or requires you to restart the camera if you don't get out of the way in time.The horrible photos, the frustrating focus, the draggy performance and the poor design all add to to make this the most aggrevating device that I've seen in a long time.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "LCD screen went to the dark side...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R289JRPLHS0FBS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Received this camera from Amazon around Oct. 16th.

Tam on March 20, 2012. This review is a good review and assessment of the SX260.As a long time user of Olympus point and shoots, I just wasn't convinced the last one I purchased was up to reasonable expectations. So, after searching, I settled on the SX260. I had considered its predessor the SX230 but just didn't want to pay another $100 over the Olympus I purchased instead at that time. I have never regretted the higher price for the SX260. It's worth every penny more.After 2 weeks in Europe as my first big camera outing with the SX260, I'm totally pleased. For the amateur, this camera has an excellent Auto Mode. Beyond that, it has myriad of features you can work with. It's all about how involved you want to get.E. Tam listed Video as a con. I would tell you that I am pleased with it. I've actually had other cameras which did annoying things like only zoom during video in the digital zoom mode or no audio when zooming. The SX260 does it all...optical zoom and audio. For a still camera taking videos, it does well.Low light/no Flash mode: This is absolutely terrific. I've always been frustrated with the poor quality of low light/no flash pictures of other cameras. Set to this mode, this camera takes 4 quick shots of varying exposures with one push of the shutter and then the internal software overlaps the exposures to create one amazing picture. You just have to remember to hold the camera very still because it is a slower shutter speed. No tripod needed. Many times at night the picture was better than what you could see with the naked eye. This feature alone makes this camera totally worth it to me.While the camera does a good job of not eating battery life, if you have the power save setting on, you should get another battery or two, especially if you think you are going to use the GPS feature. Set to on, it will drain batteries pretty quick. Amazon has some inexpensive generic batteries that work well.This camera does not come with a printed User Manual, only a disk if you want to print it off. Because the manual is 245 pages long, I opted to order one from \"manualsink.com\". It was worth the $15.If you want to protect your camera when you carry it around but don't like the bulk of a camera case, I bought a camera \"wrap.\" Amazon and Ebay sell them. Search for \"Pedco Wrap-up\". It attaches to the tripod socket, wraps arount the camera and secures with a velcro flap.

Primarily I needed an updated camera to replace my much loved Panasonic DMC-TZ3 we bought almost 5 years ago. A lot has changed in compact zoom \"travel\" cameras since then! I still wanted the quality optical zoom, but I now knew I wanted image stabilization, and manual settings for ISO, aperture/iris, and focus for both photos and videos. The aperture/iris setting is (somewhat) adjustable in the 1080p and iFrame but not in the 640x480 320x240 high speed modes. The ability to have a so many quality options in a light weight compact camera even though I shoot video professionally on professional cameras this camera is still quite fun to use.As many others have stated there are times you want the flexibility of everything in a small package, in fact that pretty much most of the time because very few us would enjoy carrying around all day a 4lb DSLR, or similar video camera, lighting kit, and sound kit. The SX260HS has many of the \"capabilities\" the professional cameras have, yet I wear it on my belt and hardly notice it is there.Off course there are limitations; especially in sound recording, but built-in sound is not very good on any camera.I have loved my Panasonic DMC-TZ3, but I have a relatively minor concern about the new ZS20/19; the touch screen sounds good, but fingerprints can quickly obscure the screen and in some situations it may be un-viewable. At least here where I have to deal with a lot of sun outdoors it can be. I would have liked the HDR of the ZS20/19, but there is software for that, some of it free. The panorama setting can also be duplicated with free software (Hugin).  Mainly where I purchased my Cannon they had the ZS19 for the same price and that was my main objection.In the SX260HS I do not like the built in default color setting. The neutral setting is the most realistic as well as color correctable. Unless you never plan on using some type of color correction software (which in most cases will be vastly superior to in-camera settings) the best solution is to use the neutral setting. Professional photographers use raw with the same basic precept, easier and more detailed post image manipulation.I found the 320x240 240fps mode quite difficult to work with since the iris is set. In addition, there are problems with moire and aliasing. It can be useable as I produced in a video I made called \"Birds, bees and cheese\" which is you tube. I don't think they will let me leave the link in but here it is: [...].  I have not seen reviews which test the moire on the high speeds yet. I used this camera to shoot mostly 1080p 24fps video of \"birds, bees and cheese\" so it shows some of the capabilities will be viewable at 1080p. There are also samples of the 640x480 120fps and 640x480 24fps so you can see how important it may be to you shooting everything in 1080p.Focusing on wildlife in the outdoors is even with the best equipment difficult. For instance, with a bird in a tree, the auto setting will want to focus on the leaves/branches. In my short movie I shot a bird in a tree and some shots were definitely sharper than others, but because of the full zoom I ended up using that shot was not the sharpest (but can you tell). So until there is truly pinpoint tracking you will need to be manual to be somewhat assured of the best shot. If you get too close for the autofocus I've seen the bird will fly. The 20x=500mm is very functional and I've found even at 39x=975mm the photo/video is generally useable. Even on a 50\" HDTV. 1000mm (F6.8) is a very big lens on a DSLR (with the best ones I can find quickly) only down to F5.6.The auto focus can be off a hair or 2 and although the image is not super sharp for most of us its fine. In addition I am not so sure the focus distances on the MF indicator are accurate either. I think the M setting should have Manual focus as default.My opening photo would be be much sharper if I had used a tripod and stitched a panorama, whereas I cropped a single photo and then did Ken Burns pan on the photo.If you are very perceptive the quick sound byte of the quail call has a humming sound, I believe that is actually a nearby A/C. That clip was accidentally shot at 640x480 and cropped.The close up of the bees was a difficult shot to get. I made a rig to hold the camera with and I stabilized it, but even so it wasn't super steady.I attained some nice depth of field for a few of the shots and I am quite happy with the results.From what I am reading and seeing 90% of people's problem of photos and video are primarily caused by the operator. If you want great photos/video don't expect that any camera will do it for you. Grab you camera which best suits your needs, shoot and have fun.Edit: June 20, 2012 Deleted: \"Unfortunately (for me) the video side does not maintain manual focus (switches to automatic).\"  It will stay on MF (Manual focus)in video mode says so when recording.  I went over several of my concerns above with Cannon and I found I was in error on the comment about the manual focus.Edit: Oct 21, 2012  CHDK has a hack for this camera which enables raw and other interesting and usable functions.  I am absolutely loving these expanded abilities.  At this price point I am not sure there is anything which will compare with CHDK installed.  I concur with some of the reviews which talk about the auto-focus times being longer than others in its class.  I have a relative who purchased a Sony Alpha DSLR at 3x the price (which I got to use) and that camera is super fast and impressive with its auto-focus.  After using the Sony Alpha I see how helpful (especially in sports photography) a fast auto-focus is.  Its also useful in other circumstances.  For instance it can take a few seconds to find focus when you are near full 20x zoom and that may mean you miss the shot.  Whats worse is sometimes after a few seconds it does not find the right focus.  If your intended use is lots of full zooms with auto-focus I would not recommend this camera.  For me I use auto-focus rarely, so its not as big an issue, but its also because its not very reliable.  Also, the low light capabilities are limited because of current technology, price and 4.5mm lens speed.  4.5mm lens is not a very fast lens.  When trying to avoid a flash, I've had to resort to high grainy ISOs even when a light is on the subject.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Camera!", "Author": "GT", "ReviewID": "R2RYEOW3IBMAG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had Canon powershots for many years.

When we learned of the new Canon SX260 with a 20X zoom we immediately checked it out and then purchased one through Amazon.com. It arrived just before the April, 2012 Washington DC Cherry Blossom Festival began so our first use was to record the beautiful cherry blossoms at the Tidal Basin. We both own earlier Canon ELPH's, an SD700 and SD850, which are great little 4X 'point & shoots' for carrying with us everywhere we travel, so we wanted to see the comparison in quality, as well as to utilize the greater 20X zoom capabilities of the the SX260 which coincides nicely with my Canon 20X Vixia HD camcorder.The quality of the zoom photos is excellent and the IS feature is very effective. All our first day shots were 'hand-held' but, as with any longer zoom, a tripod always assures better quality. Photo 're-cycle' time is very good and the larger LCD screen is nice but we missed the Viewfinder of our ELPH's as the sun sometimes made the LCD hard to see. The SX260 is slightly larger than our ELPH's and the position of the 'pop-up' flash interferes slightly with a good finger grip on the top left of the camera. We have not used the GPS feature as yet but wished we could have had it during a recent trip to Italy. We are still exploring other features so may 'update' this review later.Overall, we are extremely pleased with the new SX260 and would highly recommend it to people looking for an easy to carry small camera that has considerably more than just a minimum capability.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "LIKE THE SX260 A LOT !!! ..Great versatility & fits pockets.....", "Author": "Bears Fan Jim \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "R2V4CWQ9P6G26C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Several updated comments 4-20-13 :MAJOR PROS:a./  Good results at ISO 800 or less. Indoors, don't let the Auto take you to 1600 as it often wants to do - set to P mode and ISO at 800 for most indoor shooting where there is any movement. Better lit indoor scenes can use P or A mode and ISO400, if you are not shooting moving kids or pets.  At least one reviewer commented that outdoor exposure was always too high, but I disagree, and my SX260 has never tried to use ISO800 outdoors as one person said. I think some people fiddled with settings and forgot what they did....:) There is always the \"Reset\" in the settings menu: If you don't think things are working correctly, you can clear most of what has gone before with a Reset and not lose any pictures already taken.b./  Nice zoom out to full optical 20X, and even on out to about 28-30X...Past that, maybe, maybe not. according to lighting conditions. Indoors, try not to go past 3 to 5X without flash, or the zoom will darken your photo. Panasonic's FZ200 zoom is better indoors and out, but it is also a much bulkier and more expensive camera.c./  Manually ajustable flash...very useful, for those restaurant and party scenes. Take a practice flash or two to get the proper compensation for the particular room lighting, and you are ready for the rest of the night, without having to fiddle around every with so many practice shots. With flash, you can set ISO, or use Auto ISO, and the camera will do well. I have used all the combinations to ISO 1600 indoors with good results. You can stop just about all kid and pet movements at 1600 with or without flash. Learn what works in practice shots inside at different light levels and time of day, instead of waiting and maybe missing an important shot. Photography is a practice, not a grab-and-shoot-that-perfect-shot. You have to get lucky if you rely on that !  Even without adjusting the flash power,Auto Flash is quite good, and appears to me to do a good job calculating distance to the subject, then minimizing the flash power if too close. Usable flash range varies by complexity of the subject, but for a built-in unit I rate it pretty high. I previously loved my Lumix ZS15, but its definite weak point was its nonadjustable and out-of-balance flash.d./  Live View, which lets you change (1)darkness, (2)vividness, and (3) warm/cool, and the effect is immediately viewable on the LCD.e,/  Color rendition is among the best of the under-$300 point-and-shoots. Again, that Live View option helps if you want to adjust color. The \"Custom Set\" for White Balance also works as well as any compact I've used. Go to WB menu, choose Custom Set, press the Disp button and then take a pic of something lighted in the subject area that is very white (a napkin ?).....then you are ready for the real photo, without doing anything else to WB.f./  Decent battery life, with GPS not running. If you use GPS a lot, or if you forget and keep it running, buy, charge, and set aside an extra battery or two. Also of course, if you us this camera as a video recorder, you would need an extra battery to carry with you. The battery for the SX260 is physically quite small for a camera that has GPS and good enough video that you will be using it quite a lot.g./  Speaking of video, I have very little complaint as I now used the video quite a lot. I tend to set the video for 1280x720, which gives better playback on more computer video players., and looks pretty good on an HDTV too. On a laptop or tablet, it looks great. Video recording mode has exposure and white balance adjustment settings also, which is very handy.g./  Very nice macro. This is where a good compact camera outperforms ILC's and DSLRs, which cannot do macro closer than 9-10 inches, without an expensive \"true macro\" lens. The SX260 can do macro down to anout 2 inches. Also, the \"macro zoom\" focus option works pretty well to get nice close-ups from a couple of feet away, esp. if you use a tripod or the wind is not too strong outdoors.MAJOR CONS:a./ That pesky flash position is really no big deal : to keep it from popping up when you don't want it, just set the Flash to off in the menu ; It's a lot better to have to turn a flash on when you need it, than to risk jamming the mechanism.  I have had ZERO problems with the pop-up after following this procedure, so I really think most defective claims are from \"finger jammers\", not from the actual pop-up flash mechanism.b./ Indoor non-flash quality hits a wall at ISO800, as far as significantly magnified viewing, and 1600 is strictly standard view only. But in defense, I tried a $349 Olympus XZ1, and its 800 and 1600 was only a bit better.  ( My other camera is a NEX-5N, if you want a very usable ISO 3200 and have $600 to spend.)c./ The LCD brightness is adjustable through the menu, but still can be a problem outdoors. I would rate it a solid B among all those I've tried.d./ On a more advanced level, continuous shooting speed is not that great in practice, esp if in continuous focus setting. Not exactly a sports car camera, more a high-end sedan with good options, but also a great put-it-in-Drive-and-press-the-gas family car._________________________________________________________________________________Overall, a very capable compact camera for everyday use, combining macro, zoom, and decent low-light in a very pocketable design and easy to learn interface.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compared this to the Lumix ZS19 and it came short", "Author": "Busy at Having Fun", "ReviewID": "R1G0WWBPH9SOGV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I want to preface that I am not a professional or very dedicated photographer.

We have a 4 yr old and a 2 yr old that are never still, yet I think we've only gotten maybe 2 blurry pictures out of the hundreds we've taken in the past month. It will also take a great still shot. Colors are great....just a great camera. So happy we found it and didn't drop the $1200 to get a DSLR. This is exactly what we were looking for in regards to size, price, picture quality etc. I would recommend this camera to anyone! Also even though it is a \"point and shoot\" if you feel like getting more technical those options are accessible to play around with.

Even caught ups fireworks, glow stick , Christmas trees amazingly well! (look at my tree in the customers pictures). The zoom is my other favorite! you can be in the last seat, way up in a huge stadium at a concert, and still get a really sharp and super close up to you favorite artist!..ill definitely recommend this camera to any one.Is the best small digital camera I've own up to this point.The cons:Just like many 4 stars say.. the flash location!BE AWARE OF THIS.. I WAS AWARE BEFORE BUYING IT, SINCE A LOT OF REVIEW TELL THIS.Everyone will definitely have a problem with the flash location, In my case I don't really care because I've gotten used to putting my finger somewhere else while taking a picture, but it does bother when you give it to somewhere else and they put the finger in there and the flash won't come up.You just ALWAYS have to remember to tell them not do that before taking it, or just like I do it, I quickly turn off the camera & randomly take a picture (to the floor, anywhere) before giving the camera to someone and the flash will stay out for a while for the next picture (or until you turn it off). People will see the flash is there and that makes them not to touch it.I can't really give this camera 4 stars just because of this, because In my opinion all of the amazing pro's that it has are worth it!

This camera was a present for my wife. It has the newer Digic 5 (my 7D has dual 4's) and seems to do a pretty darn good job!  The SX260 HS has a built in GPS and I'd recommend turning the logger function off if you don't want to drain your battery. If left on, the camera will continue to keep a track of your location even though the camera itself is 'off.' When the tracker is off, the GPS will continue to set the EXIF data in your pictures with the current GPS location & time. The logger just keeps track of where you have been which may be useful if you are kayaking, hiking, biking etc.  It can also tag people's faces that it recognizes. I have not found this to work very well but I may just need to add people's faces more often. One thing I have realized is it may be useful to have people smiling when you are adding to its recognition database since that is the way they look (hopefully) when you are taking their picture.03/25/2013 Update:  One neat feature I neglected to mention was this camera can be set to update its internal clock whenever it can get a GPS lock. This feature is especially useful after a daylight savings time change and you change all the clocks in the house but forget to set your camera's clock  This camera does a pretty fair job in low light situations. One thing to be careful of is how you hold the camera as the flash will pop up (as needed) right where your left index finger usually goes while steadying the camera.

Naimpally \"avid music and movie fan\"", "ReviewID": "RUPA8G8WQWP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little background:  I have owned several film SLRs (Olympus OM1, Minolta XD11) as well as point and shoot (P+S) film cameras (Nikon, Minolta) and over the last few years, several P+S digital cameras (Canon, Panasonic). One of the most important things I have found is the need for a decent wide angle lens.  For a P+S camera, I make sure it goes to at least (the equivalent of) 25mm at the widest angle.  Otherwise, if I am standing close to a large object, I am unable to frame it properly.  The lack of a 25mm wide angle is what prevented me from buying the earlier model of this camera, the SX230HS.The SX260HS addresses this issue by having a 20x zoom lens that goes from 25mm to 200mm.  This covers a very useable range in terms of wide angle to telephoto.  The quality of the pictures is excellent.  The only issue, as others have noted, is that in low light, the auto focus isn't that great - it can take some time to focus.  A minor inconvenience is that the pop up flash has been placed on the left side, where I am used to grasping the camera.  This does take some adjustment and I wish they had placed the flash in the middle rather on the left side.  However, like most P+S cameras, the flash is fairly anemic (doesn't go beyond 10-15 feet), so most of the time I end up turning off the flash anyway and just shooting using available light.  Another thing to note is that, like many other P+S cameras, the battery is not very big, so it pays to buy 1-2 extra battery packs.This is the first camera in a long time that has got me passionate about photography again.  The relatively small size allows it to be easily carried, while the very versatile 20x zoom lens allows for excellent closeups as well as wide angle shots.  Another thing to note is that, using the publicly available CHDK software, the stock firmware can be temporarily bypassed, allowing for longer (e.g., 1 hour) videos, shooting in RAW mode, etc.All in all, the SX260HS is an excellent P+S camera that is small but versatile.  Like any P+S, there are some design tradeoffs, and so the camera is not without its minor flaws, but all things considered, if you are in the market for a P+S camera, the SX260HS is worth checking out, especially considering Canon aggressively discounts the SX260HS compared to comparable cameras from Sony (DSC-HX20V, DSC-HX30V) and Nikon (S9300).", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent photo quality", "Author": "AKN", "ReviewID": "R1EVL6K2DJJIKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love everything I've ever owned made by Canon, and this camera is no exception.

I am employed in an Audio-Visual field and take photos as part of my job. I have also taken over 15,000 family photos.  I was looking for a small camera for home that had some manual controls and thought this camera fit the bill.Unfortunately, it is in the repair shop for the third time. The first time they replaced the focus assembly. As soon as I began using it I noticed the problem wasn't corrected and I immediately sent it back. The focus assembly was then replaced a second time. I started using it again with mixed results, getting a few very nice photos, but the majority of them were unacceptable and I could not trust it for important photos. At this point I noticed the camera in complete auto mode would very often default to ISO1600. I took the same pictures with my Canon Vixia video camera in still camera mode and the pictures came out great. The ISO1600 occurred in both well-lit situations and in medium lighting.  I spent time on the phone with a technician changing some settings and doing some testing but ultimately it went back a third time.A \"Senior Technician\" reviewed sample pictures and agreed that several settings seemed off including iso, aperture, and shutter speed and he was going to consult with a supervisor.  I spoke to a supervisor and asked for a replacement camera based on all the issues. He said he would not send a replacement because the repair was too far along and he wanted me to try the camera after the repair and we could take it from there. I asked what was done in the repair and he said nothing was found to be wrong with the camera and no repairs were made. I asked how trying it after the repair would help if no repairs were made. He then proceeded to tell me that if I continued to have problems after I got my camera back he would have me talk to a technician on how to properly take the pictures. I explained to him I take photos as part of my job and I understood the operation of the camera and if he would just allow me to send him a couple sample pictures he could see the issue I was having.  He would also see that the photos were taken in a normal picture taking environment where a typical point and shoot camera would excel . He said that sending him samples wasn't possible and he would only go by the opinion of his technician. I also asked to speak to the person making the repair hoping if I could further clarify the problem maybe it could be corrected, he told me that wasn't possible either. In my opinion I felt the supervisor was condescending and unwilling to offer any real solution.After years of buying Canon still cameras and video cameras I think it is now time to look at other brands.If you look under the one and two star reviews for the sx230 and sx260 you will see other people have had similar issues with these cameras.If you look at the product images I added a photo of a stuffed bear. I also uploaded it to a Canon technician who said it had sharp focus and he could see the individual hairs of the bear. When I argued it was not in focus he said it was a great photo because it has a soft look like it was taken in a studio. This is how most of my indoor pictures have been coming out. It's hard to argue with support when they tell me this is a great quality photo.I also spent time taking duplicate photos one with the canon camera and one with my canon hfs20 camcorder. The camcorder stills consistently came out great while the still camera had grainy out of focus pictures.I would expect a dedicated camera should take better pictures than a camcorder but that is not the case for me.

Slower than my ancient Olympus. I don't understand this and wonder if it 'just' a glitch with the particular camera I received or if it is the case with all of them. For example, I was trying to take a pic of my neighbor's kitty standing upright on its back 2 legs and even though he did this for what seemed an extended period of time and I took the photo while he was standing, by the time it 'registered\" he was back on all fours and the standing shot was missed. This happened several times in a row and made me realize how slowly the shots are 'registering'. Does anybody else have the same experience? I would greatly appreciate any insights.

What I experienced using the SX260 was the following.The time between taking another picture was too slow. It would take 2 seconds or more between shots to take another picture. The popup flash; not unique to this make or model; made it difficult to hold the camera. It would pop up and then retract and you need to keep your fingers out of the way. The zoom was powerful but using it greatly reduced the quality of the picture. The low light ability of this camera was extremely lacking. With the flash and camera on auto the flash would work sporadically. Many indoor photos were too dark to see. What you see on the LCD display is not what the picture will look like. The LCD screen would look dark and grainy and the picture would come out fine and other times it would look great and the picture would come out looking terrible.I purchase this camera based on the overwhelming number of great reviews and was very disappointed with my experience using this camera. I found it hard to hold. Trying to never have a finger in the way of the flash made it even more difficult. I thought I wanted or needed a super zoom but there is no need if the picture quality is going to be degraded enough to make them useless.Anything is possible and based on the number of 5 star reviews I may have received a lemon.

I have a Canon 20D SLR that usually sits in the hotel room on trips because it is too big and heavy to carry on wander abouts. This camera slips very easily into a front pocket of my pants, so it is there when I want it.  It has more bells and whistles than the 20D, which cost $2k in 2005. That's a sobering thought...Here are some LIKe and DISLIKE ramblings...DISLIKE: No viewfinder, but I knew that when I bought it--just didn't realize how much I would miss it. Small cameras generally cannot have both a viewfinder and a large LCD screen.LIKE: The white balance for various settings like bright sun, cloudy, tungsten etc. seem very accurate.DISLIKE: No printed manual--It's 246 pages, and you most likely will need to read it to understand half of what the camera can do.LIKE: Fast. Takes about 2 seconds to turn on and extend the lens. Less, to re-extend the lens from sleep mode.DISLIKE: Internal stabilization. I no longer put any faith in this and recommend getting a small, malleable tripod. Except in very bright sunlight, a picture taken one-handed will show jitter, and some two-handed shots will also show jitter. Brace the camera against a wall or lamp post where possible.LIKE: Pretty good video, but I can faintly hear the servo whine in the background in quiet settings. Using the telephoto in video mode without a tripod/brace will exacerbate movement.DISLIKE: Naturally, it won't react as fast as a dSLR, especially in lower light settings. For action shots, take bursts of multiple shots and keep the best ones.DISLIKE: No RAW.I believe that if I had the time to truly read the manual, I would be better able to understand the camera's logic and thereby possibly circumvent permutations I inadvertently may create.I'm a Canon camera devotee. I compared a lot of cameras on the CU website, and then read a lot of reviews on Amazon. I narrowed my choices down to the S95 and the SX260. I ended up choosing this one for the 20X optical zoom over the S95's potentially better low light capabilities. Now, if I did it over again, I might opt for the S95. Tough choice.If you purchase this camera, I recommend a fast card like the SanDisk 32 GB SDHC Class 10. With the least compression, it will hold over 5500 pictures. I also recommend you buy at least one other battery as they average between 230 and 260 shots per battery.

I was looking for a good camera because my old Nikon was junk. When I got it, I went outside right away and started shooting (I love taking pictures). I was absolutely amazed. Every time I took a picture, I was shocked at the clear quality. I had been concerned about it not having RAW, but I have no regrets. The only thing is, I took it out onto the beach and didn't take good enough care of it, and now there's some minor problem with the lens cover not popping out by itself (It didn't affect the pic quality) because I got sand into it:(. I still love it though. The only complaint I have is some of the night scene pictures aren't very good (sunset is spectacular though), and, of course, I blame myself for not taking more care with it! :( I saw some reviews that the flash placement was a problem? It doesn't bother me because there's enough space behind it to grip, but, of course, I realize that to some people this is big. Another thing is the battery. I leave my battery in the charger most of time that I'm not using it, and it hasn't really given me a problem so far. I would suggest getting a replacement battery though.I saw some reviews where people complained about slow response time? I don't know if this is common knowledge or if I sound dumb saying this, but in order to take a picture, you have to press the shutter release down halfways down until the viewfinder flashes green, THEN press it down all the way. So far, I have not had a problem with response. The camera's great for action shots. If I know somebody's going to move, I hold the shutter release down halfways, and when the action's \"going\" I press it down completely. I get some great shots.Videos? Awesome! The sound and resolution quality is great! The only complaint I have of the video is that when I'm taking videos of group singing, I can't sing because it'll pick up my voice too well.

I also don't want to lug around some monstrosity of a camera in order to take pictures of my kids and family. Sorry but being a momtographer just isn't my thing. I still want good pictures though.It was important for me to have a point-and-shoot camera that I could fit in my jeans pockets (and I don't mean skinny jeans. I suppose to a degree I wear \"mom\" jeans, lol). Anyway, this fit the bill for that. I also wanted a camera that took crisp, clear pictures. This also fit the bill for that. I ALSO wanted a camera that was easy to use, since as I said, I am no photographer or momtographer.The \"auto\" feature on this camera was lacking, big time. Although it was wonderful for taking pictures with no flash (particularly pictures of fidgety kids who can't sit still) without having blur.... it sucked for the times I wanted to have a flash for a picture! Too many picture ops. were lost because I had to roll the dial to the \"portrait\" setting, and then change that to \"flash on\" since the auto setting only allows you to have either \"auto\" flash (where IT decides, and sometimes thinks there's enough light when there isn't) or \"off.\" I HATED that about this camera and it was very, very frustrating.I also despised that the flash was a pop-up flash. Prior to this camera I had the Canon Sx110. It was a little bulkier but at least I could pop up that lens when I saw fit. This one popped up for you - except often, it was right underneath your finger. So then it would jam because your finger was holding it down (simply because your finger naturally went there in order to grip the camera correctly!)Videos were a good quality, no complaints. Though I didn't like that I wasn't able to snap stills while video was in motion. I can do that with my cell phone but not with this camera?

She is constantly taking pictures and the one I purchased for her year's ago is worn out. We enjoyed Canon Powershot for the versatility, excellent pictures and small size. Prior to my purchase I did my due diligence and reviewed all types of digital cameras on several sites including CNET reviews. This particular camera was highly recommended by CNET and the users. The users are as important if not more. Like anything new it takes a little getting use to since it has more features and is a step above my wife's old Canon Powershot. But we are using it often and liking it more each time we use it. I do recommend this camera since you can put it in your shirt pocket or a woman's purse and have it on the spur of the moment when you want more than a smart phone. My wife uses her smart phone as a camera but it has it's limitations. One CNET review indicated this particular camera's battery life was not as good as they would like. I haven't experienced this and we have taken a lot of pictures. But I always purchase a secondary battery since we like to travel and have grand kids and take a lot of pictures. I would recommend any time you have a camera have a backup battery you won't be disappointed. This recommendation has served me and the wife well over the years. It never fails, sooner or later when traveling, at the ball park, or just see something you want to take a picture the battery dies and you miss it. No problem, we immediately switch batteries and we get the shot. Another tip, be prepared and check the batteries prior to any event or leaving the house make sure both batteries are fully charged.

The zoom is absolutely amazing whether you are shooting still pictures or video.  I have NOT experienced high pitched sound some users are hearing during video playback, either on my computer straight from the SD card or via my TV using an HDMI cable.  That was a huge relief since that apparently is a deal-breaker for many users but the sound on my video is excellent.Last night I shot an entire tennis match by attaching the camera to a small tripod then tying the tripod to the fence and just letting it run for a couple of hours and the detail it captured was incredible.  You could easily pick up the ball movement even on fast rallies.  Even though the camera was probably 20 feet from the closest player you could also pickup quite a bit of dialog.  I then set up the tripod on the court and shot slow motion video of myself serving which was eye-opening to say the least.  This is a pretty unique and useful feature for breaking down and analyzing sports activities and was one of the key reasons I focused on this camera in the first place.I also really like the quick single button video record and stop button on the back of the camera which makes it much easier to capture impromptu scenes.  The low light performance is probably not as good as a DSLR (I don't own one so I don't know for certain) but it seems quite good to me and certainly better than any previous digital camera I have ever owned including my Panasonic FZ-20 I've owned since 2006.  I used to be wowed by my FZ-20's 12x zoom lens which was awesome for outdoor photography but this 20x beast is even better and this camera is about 1/4th the size of the FZ-20.There are so many different shooting modes and options I am still learning them all but the included CD with a User's Guide is very comprehensive so I'm confident I'll eventually learn what I need to know to get the most out of the camera.  The start up time seems very responsive and about the same or quicker than my older Canon A700 or my wife's Canon newer SD1200.

After an extensive search, I bought it based on previous, detailed reviews, which were very helpful.  I previously owned a less expensive Canon which served me well for years, so I had no trouble figuring out the new camera's settings.  I didn't particularly want a camera this powerful and with so many features, but it was highly rated for great photo images, and that was #1 with me.I'm enjoying the 20x zoom more than I anticipated -- very nice.  I tested the video, and it worked fine for my occasional use.  I was a little concerned about the placement of the pop-up flash, but I found that this camera takes great pictures in low light, so I don't expect to use the flash that often. (I turned the auto-flash off until needed.  I can train myself to hold the camera as shown in the owner's guide to avoid blocking the pop-up.  No big deal for me.)The camera size is a bit longer but thinner than my previous one. It still fits in my pocket, which was a must-have feature for me.  I miss the viewfinder.  I was taking one picture in bright sunshine, and I could not see if I had the shot I wanted or not.  Oh well . . . it appears none of the cameras in this class has the viewfinder.I bought two SanDisk Extreme 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s SDSDX-032G-AFFP, as recommended.  They worked great!  I'm not sure if this camera would work as well with a lesser card.  Be sure to order the card in the RETAIL (original) packaging, rather than in the 'Frustration Free' packaging.  Per other reviews, there appears to be a problem with counterfeit cards if you don't get it in the original, hard plastic wrapping.

I love the creative settings, they are so fun and I like making pictures black and white. Fish eye, toy camera, poster effect, and miniature are neat.

So I'll outline briefly the problems I've had in my 15 months of ownership, as an alert to prospective buyers, who will find similar issues with the new SX280 HS upgraded model.The pop-up flash is an annoyance, and one that has earned a few cuss words from me when it caused the camera to stall and require a reboot, effectively loosing a prime shot.  The ideal resting place for the left forefinger is atop the left corner of the camera.  If the automatic flash is on and the light low enough, the flash will emerge unexpectedly under that finger.  The finger will cause interference enough that the flash won't fully pop up.  That tells the camera to leave you a message that the camera must be turned off and then on again in order to resume operations.  I've missed many good shots as a result.  It would seem to me the flash should not use the extra mechanism space and weight that a pop-up demands, but rather should be built in to the left upper front corner like many less expensive cameras.The focus speed can be slow, especially in telephoto mode, but that is common among all digital cameras.  The newer SX280 HS has apparently sped the focus up by using a faster image processor, and that is attractive to me since I've experienced some aggravating low-light focus lag with my SX260 HS;  as I said, I like the camera in most regards and will keep it because of them, but there are these few gripes.  The same basic camera minus these cons would be my ideal all-around, go to, easy-carry camera.The diaphragm lens cover proved nearly disastrous last summer.  Most compacts, if not all, use them.  But moving from shot to shot outdoors on a vacation means not examining closely the camera lens each and every time I shut it off - I mean who really is in that habit?  Apparently a piece of dirt or small grit landed on the lens at some point, so when the cover closed, it jammed.  I had trouble getting it to close, but eventually it did, and never has jammed like that since.  I saw no debris on the lens or camera.  But some time later I was cleaning the lens and noticed two side-by-side fine scratches or nicks near the lens middle.  They don't appear to affect the images taken, but I was pretty depressed about those scratches that had to have come from that diaphragm/iris type of cover that moves across the lens surface;  after 40 years using Canon cameras, I am very careful about handling them, and the exposed lens gets near nothing that could harm it, and is carefully brushed and cleaned with specialized equipment.I was cleaning the lens again a few weeks ago and found a small white speck that wouldn't come off.  Close inspection revealed it was actually inside, between lens components!  That may be why there was a mild small halo on one image I took;  there may be more, and without further testing I can't be sure the speck is the cause.  Being only 2 months out of warranty, Canon Customer Service had me send it to Virginia for inspection and possible repair.  $13 shipping and 2 days later they inform me they don't repair such cameras, and they don't mention the debris inside the lens, only the scratches.  They offer to send me a \"refurbished\" or new one for $249.  No thanks.  Then their Loyalty Program offers an exchange for $158.  Hmmm.  No, just send the camera back.  If it still takes good pix with no image degradation, I'll use it or find a good buy on an SX280 HS - so far around $263, $8 more than I paid for the SX260 HS.I note one other minor glitch.  The service repair document from Canon did not enter a figure in the serial number field.  When I submitted it to begin with, I had to get that number off the original registration and box.  Why?  Because they don't engrave serial numbers anymore apparently;  they are just printed as far as I can tell, and mine had worn off enough as to not be legible on the camera.  I've got 40 year old Canon SLR's with easily read serial numbers.  Cheez.  So nobody is supposed to care if it's stolen or something.  Just like they don't repair them, they replace them.  $300 disposable cameras... what have we come to.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great walk-about camera", "Author": "Arthur Held", "ReviewID": "R1AOXAYHIS8OWZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this as my walk-about pocket camera.

These make it much easier to get the color and exposure you want than fiddling with more advanced controls, although those are there for people who want them.It comes with a separate battery charger that you put the battery into; this is a nice extra when so many new cameras are cheaping out and require you to charge the battery inside the camera instead.The camera has a couple of stupid design issues - when you hold the camera, your right index finger naturally ends up on top of the power button (which feels and looks a lot like the shutter button), and your left index finger naturally ends up on top of the pop-up flash. This means that often when you want to take a photo, you'll either accidentally turn off the camera, or you'll prevent the flash from popping up (which causes an error requiring you to restart the camera).I also wish this camera had is a real panorama mode; instead it's got only \"stitch assist\" which helps you take a series of shots that line up.

I don't/can't go in explicit technical details of a shot, all I can tell about a picture is weather I like it or not!I bought this camera due to my prior very good experience with other Canon Cameras. I had developed almost blind faith in Canon quality.  I have/had Canon SD1100IS, SD1300IS, and SX200IS. I have been most happy with SX200IS with very good picture/ Video quality and it being a mega zoom camera.I thought, and had hoped for, that SX260HS would be equal or better than SX200IS.  At least, all the technical specs are better.  However, I think Canon tried to bite too much this time, got ahead of theirselves.  They didn't need to try besting theirselves if  technology couldn't support it.  I am unhappy with this camera from day one, and honestly, can't wait to go back and get another SX200IS.  (my daughter smashed it :( )  Here are the reasons why:1. Slow response time, at least compare to SX200IS. I can't give you exact details, but I can't seem to capture quick moments of my 2 years old daughter that I was able to with SX200IS.2. Distorted, wavey pictures often. (it is called Barrel effect I think.)  Faces and objects look distorted as you go away from the center.3. HD Video zoom - didn't keep the focus while changing zoom. I got blurry, lost focus, videos often, to the point where I don't use zoom at all during video.  Just a second or two of blurry focus makes the whole clip pain to watch for the rest of your life.3. HD Video - 1080P videos look choppy. Not sure if 24FPS has anything to do with it or not, bu I have hours of 720P HD video from SX200IS and it is buttry smooth. I think 720P is good for SX260HS too, but upgraded specs of 1080P aren't good for me.4. I am finding more and more blurry, lost focused pictures.  I took about 10 pics outside in low lights, and 8 of them turned out to be blurry. I am Mad.  I am done with this camera.  I will also seriously consider buying locally to so that I can return POS like this easily, even if it costs a little bit more.There might be other reasons, but just the fact that I am not anxious to take pictures with this camera like other Canon camera's I had before makes me rate this 1 Star.edit 11/13/12: Added #4, and corrected a couple of typos.", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "On my second one and it's going back", "Author": "CPlant", "ReviewID": "R3K48QPF78E1NI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I went to the store to specifically buy this camera.

This is an unacceptable, as every Canon camera I've ever had, including this one until recently, has allowed for batteries to be left in for long periods of time.  I contacted Canon support, and I was told to take the battery out when the camera is not in use.  This defeats the purpose of a point and shoot household camera.

I just assumed that since the ELPH 300 was so good, spending more on another Canon would be even better and the 20X zoom was 4 times that of the previous 300HS, how could I go wrong. Strange as it seems, I just didn't think the pictures were that good, or as good as the older less expensive 300HS. I took pictures of our yard and compared them to the same exact shots from before and I just didn't think they were as good. Ultimately I found the next generation of the original 300HS, the 330HS and bought it. I took the same shots of the yard and sure enough, they were much better than the SX260. Granted, these were taken in the Auto mode but since they all were, it was a decent comparison. The 300 & 330HS also had a slightly wider lens than the SX260.

Now I like them small, light and point and shoot which is practical for travelling. If I am not running out of time to study its other features, I will study its manual mode.  I also chose to buy this because of its 25mm wide angle lens and its its high telephoto capacity.  On top of that it is capable of making 30 minute movies.  I noted that I can also put together different still pictures to make a video.  It is easy to operate, at least the auto smart mode because I have had a canon powershot before.  I may have to review my photography lessons though on exposure, etc to be able to do better on how to operate the manual mode. The color gray is perfect too to my taste.  I noted too the microphone in making a movie to catch the sounds. I love my new camera and it takes sharp pictures.

I wanted an inexpensive camera I can fit in my pocket to capture all the fun we have roaming around the great outdoors of Montana. This camera meets all my needs and takes a much faster and slightly better quality image than my previous Canon, the SD790 IS (which I have basically destroyed by throwing it in the bottom of my purse or backpack with no protection. The casing eventually starts to come apart, who knew!?). I LOVE the fun photo options and color, light, and shutter speed variables it allows you to change. I still wish I could take panoramas without having to stitch them together in a program, but I had that complaint with my old Canon too. It is a little awkward getting used to the flash placement but I love that the flash doesn't overpower the pictures and you have the option to set how strong the flash strength is. A week into the purchase and I am still learning all the functions, there are a lot of neat things like smooth skin pictures, low light pictures, vivid color, etc... I found out in my messing around that it can take a few seconds of movie with each picture and make a highlight reel \"movie\" of your experience with audio... especially hilarious when you didn't know you were recording.

My experience has been very good.  The GPS works flawlessly and bringing in the photos to Aperture on my iMac, the placement of the photos on the map is perfect. I haven't yet tried the GPS log but will soon.  The optical zoom range (20-1 with IS) is nothing short of spectacular and the pictures when blown up remain as sharp as to be expected with a 12 megapixel camera.  Some have complained about the placement of the popup flash but while it is not optimal, it is easy to get used to.  Others have complained about the battery life but this is quite manageable, especially if you carry a few extra batteries (which are quite inexpensive).  I've noticed battery life issues only when having GPS logging on and this is to be expected as you are running the GPS in the camera even when it is otherwise off.  If you have a problem with that, just turn off the GPS logging.The controls are very simple, once you understand them.  It took me a while (I had to look at the documentation -- imagine that) to figure out that the little ring around the function set has a purpose as a wheel.

I have missed too many movie opportunities in the past while twisting a dial on other cameras to get to the movie function, often not quite getting to that function.  And also the problems of then forgetting I'm in movie mode when I try to shoot photos again.One thing that is important to know is that this is not the lightest of cameras.  It's nowhere near as heavy or bulky as a DLSR but it is a bit larger and noticeably heavier that a typical point and shoot.  But, then there is more in there -- the GPS and the very long optical zoom -- a small price for those features.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "sx260", "Author": "Carol E.

The nice feature of buying within the Canon camera family is that my learning curve is short. I purchased this camera two days before a trip to France. The camera is light weight, with an impressive zoom, reasonably small and fits into my back pocket and it made some great pictures. I did read other reviews prior to my purchase. And, I agree that the location of the flash is inconvenient. Nonetheless, I have worked out a solution. If I put the camera dial on the \"p\" setting, then all I needed to do was to set the ASA.  I took many night pictures of the Eiffel Tower while I was on a moving tour boat. I set the ASA to 1600 and the flash never deployed and the pictures were perfect for my needs. And, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the Garmin- style geographic locator must be turned off or the battery life will suffer dramatically.This is a great camera for travelers and the cost was just north of $200.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Alex E.

Second, I usually carry the camera in my pocket and have learned to check the dial to make sure the camera is on the right setting before I start shooting, as  the dial moves easily. The good news is, as you turn the setting dial, the screen tells you what setting you are on (ex: automatic, manual, live, video, etc.) and what it does, so you can make adjustments quickly and easily, without squinting in the dark to confirm the setting.

It took beautiful photos that printed out like art work on my Canon Pixma.  For vacations, photos taken around the house, portraits, action shots in the yard...it was perfect.  But, it lacked one highly needed feature for our family.  It could not take quality photos at a distance, particularly indoors in artificial light.  We attend gymnasium events and auditorium events to watch the kids in action.  All the photos taken in \"zoom\" would be blurry or totally out of focus or so grainy they were useless.I spoke to Canon tech support and they explained that one major reason was due to the camera having digital zoom rather than optical zoom.  I had my doubts, but because these are such important photos for us to have I bought the Canon PowerShot SX260 HS.  WOW!  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  The guy at tech support has given us a gift that we will treasure for many years...photos...memories...fun.  The optical zoom removes all the problems we had.  You can still get minor blurring at the most distant zoom setting, but they are useable even at that point.

I have found that the low battery indicator doesn't accurately show a progression from fully charged to almost discharged. With the spare batteries I am never out of power.The only con that I see is that the rotating ring that is used to change ISO or shutter speed is rather sensative and I find myself constanly accessing other features that I am not intending to change or use. A light touch is required when rotating this ring. I have been using this camera for over a month now and have gotten some really quality photos. The images are crisp and rich in color. I don't use the auto settings because often the resulting images tend to be a little over exposed. This I find is normal though with the auto setting on most cameras.

Stauber \"Bob_NJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2CZQXYJTGZPOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the camera a few days ago and my initial impressions are very positive. I bought this camera to replace my older Olympus 550uz or 7.1mp and 16x zoom. I wanted a more compact camera that fit in my pocket for travel while still being able to accomplish the same things as my old camera.I have tested it out and the pictures look as good as indicated in many other reviews. However, I do not yet know if my video will have the noise problem some others have encountered. Looking at video from the camera viewfinder and listening through the camera speakers have only indicated some light backround noice, but nothing that seemed offensive to me.This camera also gives the user quite a bit of freedom to set their own speed, aperature or full manual mode as well as fully automatic. This is a major reason I chose this camera. One feature I liked on my old camera was the SCN mode that I used frequently when shooting through glass or on a bus. Although this is not part of the SCN function on this Canon, the camera is smart enough in to take a great picture through glass in AUTO mode.I have learned that it is necessary to read the manual and understand how a camera works and what it can do before evaluating the camera itself. I have seen many reviews mentioning blurry pictures. I originally had this problem with my old camera and had to learn how to use the auto-focus mode. Once I did, I now get clear pictures. Using this technique, which involves letting the camera get the exposure correct with a 1/2 button depress followed by a quick full press once set allows for the best pictures. When objects are in motion, I always go to fast exposure in Tv mode with 1/1000 setting or faster, depending on lighting. The face recognition function also looks quite useful.I have not yet tried all functions, but most seem like my old camera, and that makes me satisfied with the purchase. One thing I especially like is the slow-motion picture mode in video that lets you shoot video with over 200 frames/sec and plays them back at normal speed to allow for the slow-motion effect.Lastly, the handling of the camera is nice and it feels well build (not cheap) when holding it. The flash is in an awkward spot but I have learned to work around it and don't take many flash pictures anyway.For any new users that worry about fast battery use, I have learned to turn my camera off when not in use and then back on when I plan to use it. Leaving a digital camera on indefinately will use up your batteries pretty quickly.Update...4/24/2013...I have now used the camera quite a bit and on a vacation and the pictures have turned out quite well. I like the automatic focus that \"knows\" what to focus upon. It works well through windows. The only complaint I have is some sunset pictures I took were too yellow rather than reddish.

I have used it at a number of local events and a trip to California with my wife.  I leave the camera on the Automatic setting. Camera reactiion time when you take a picture is very quick.  The pictures are beautiful.  The video is excellent.  In fact I feel it is better than the video obtained with the SX40.  The 20X zoom is ample, easy to use, and focus is quick and accurate. The major distraction for many people is the pop up flash.  I disabled it and find that the camera is amply capable of taking excellent pictures in most light conditions. Battery life is modest.  I find I am taking between 100 and 150 pictures before battery power decreases.  I have purchased a few back up batteries at very modest prices ($12) from Amazon and keep at least one back up available.

Don't let the smaller 12.1 megapixel number fool you. It doesn't matter unless you plan to print a poster-board picture at full HD... I don't think you want to.

Was really disappointed that Kodak was done with cameras as I loved it.  As a replacement I first bought a Nikon L810 because it was similar style to my Kodak but had an even bigger zoom and had pretty good reviews.  It was either defective or just a terrible camera because nothing would focus and there was blur in almost every picture.Amazon was great about returning it but I still had to find a new camera.  I went to Best Buy so I could actually try some out and see them first hand.  This one was on sale for $199 and everyone was checking it out.  I was a little hesitant because of the smaller size than my Kodak but as soon as I picked it up I was impressed.  The zoom is much larger than my Kodak even with the smaller size.  The options are great and so many to choose from.  The video just requires a quick click of a button, no switching settings like my Kodak.  No blur and good, easy focus.  I am now loving the smaller size since it is much easier to tote around but still has an amazing 20x zoom!  Most smaller cameras only have a 5x zoom.  The image stabilization works great.  That was another concern about getting a smaller camera, with less to hold onto I was worried that there would be too much shaking especially with the full zoom. Amazingly, this has not been a problem.  I took pics of my kids at the bottom of the sledding hill, zoomed further than the optical zoom and they turned out crisp and clear. So did the video.  Speaking of the video, other reviewers mentioned a high pitch noise.  I only noticed any kind of background noise while zooming in and out and it wasn't that loud.  That seems to be the biggest and almost only complaint about this camera and I am soooo happy I didn't let it get in the way of deciding on this camera!

I hadn't been allowed to get a Kodak because they're going out of the camera business, so I'd settled on this one. But it's definitely grown on me in the two days I've had it, and I just adore this camera.The image quality is excellent, with fairly minimal noise. In full optical zoom, obviously, there's noise, and I would recommend a tripod to get the full benefits of the 20x. Colors are very vivid and true to their actual pigments(and, if you so choose, you can accentuate certain colors via color settings).So here we go.PROS:- excellent optical zoom, good to use in situations where you can't get close or want to photograph some scenery- variety of settings to experiment and tinker with, one of my favorites is the color swap.- shutter speed and aperture are  completely free to be manipulated, as well as many other aspects of shooting (the camera isn't always stuck in Auto)- The macro is fairly versatile, it can take pictures from more than just one specific cm range- if you're not an expert photographer and are new to it like myself, this camera can walk you right through the motions. Want to take a picture in the snow, but have no idea how to set the exposure correctly? Try the snow setting, it works pretty well and with a few adjustments from you it can be perfect! Etc.- The camera has shown no signs of lag or slowness when I navigate menus, change settings, turn the features wheel, scroll through pictures, etc. It's nice and quick.and there are many, many more... but I can't possibly get them all here!CONS:- the camera can be a bit slow to shoot when the shutter is depressed, especially with a flash. if you want to get an action shot, plan accordingly to shoot slightly before the event you're taking a picture of.- when in slow-motion video mode, the feature that allows you to take 240-frame-per-second videos, the video gets extremely dark. I recommend finding a good light to be under, because no matter how much I've fought with the thing it won't brighten the picture. However, this could also be human error; perhaps the option is there and I'm just not finding it.- Battery life is fairly short. ...then again I carry this baby around and take dozens of pictures because I just love it to death.In short, this is a great starting camera for someone who wants to learn how to take pictures while still capturing moments (ooh, how cliche) with great quality and a large variety of options! I'd recommend it to anyone; I read a review from a rather experienced photographer who loved this camera because it's so conveniently sized and is still a force to be reckoned with!

The color in the pictures is so vibrant, but the most amazing part was the 20x zoom.. It actually zooms all the way to 80x! I found myself using it as a telescope whenever I wanted to see something too far away! And of course then I snapped a picture.  It especially takes well-lit pictures even when the flash is set to \"off\",  where other cameras would be too dark. The settings are easy to use and the picture review is fantasticly modern. It's also a nice size to fit into a pocket, I wish it was a little lighter but that zoom lens is worth it.  To film a movie you just push the red buton on and off, no searching for how-to. So easy.  I definitely got my money's worth here!  The only downside is that there are SO many options with this camera that I am afraid I will never know all of them.

I'm used to the super compact Canon Elph line and was somewhat skeptical about going larger.

Wide angle is important especially in tight spaces. The macro lens also did a great job focusing close up.The pictures are very vibrant, clear and sharp. The DIGIC 5 processor does an incredible job creating incredibly sharp pictures at 10fps high-speed burst shooting.This is a solid built camera with a predominantly metal outer shell compared to the all plastic competitors. This camera will withstand the rigors of everyday life and will keep on shooting. It has many magical features and GPS.Compared to the Sony HX20,Panasonic ZS19,and Nikon COOLPIX S9200 this camera takes far better pictures, easier to use and built super solid.The negatives are the pop-up flash that gets in the way of handling the camera with my big hands, lacks one-touch Panorama mode (although it has Panorama assist mode), no HDR and it does not come with a touch screen.Overall, great easy to use camera, high quality Canon UA zoom lens, wide angle, solid built with a lot of features and pretty compact.

Compared to compact superzooms that I have personally experimented with (Panasonic ZS19, Sony Cybershot DSC WX300, HX20V and HX9V, Samsung WB750, Nikon Coolpix S9100, Casio Exilim EX ZR100) Canon does better at the basics of taking photos and videos than the others.2. The optical image stabilization works well and photos come out nice even with 20x optical zoom fully extended.3. It feels thinner and lighter than most compact superzooms (though Panasonic ZS series models are technically the most compact as the Canon's lens assembly is not flush with the body).4. There is reasonable amount of space to rest your fingers behind the pop-up flash.5. The 'Live' mode is an interesting novelty as it allows you to adjust colors before you take a photo (though the default setting results in the most natural colors).6. My daylight videos turned out just fine even though many reviewers believe Canon to be behind competition in this department.7. Comes with an external charging unit which doesn't require the USB cord and allows the camera to be used with another battery while the first one is being charged.8. The context sensitive menus are easy to navigate.Cons:1. The biggest disappointment was lack of in camera Panorama mode. Canon instead has a stich assist mode which allows you to align multiple snaps and use supplied software to manually put together a panoramic image on your computer. I'd suggest Canon incorporate Casio style in-camera panorama mode, the best implementation of panorama that I have seen so far.2. Flash pops up automatically and you can't push it back down with your finger. I like the design choice of Panasonic, Casio and Samsung compact superzooms where the flash isn't pop up and of Nikon S9100 where it's a manual pop-up and can be pushed back down.3.

It is right where your fingers hold the camera when taking a picture.  It pops up automatically so you really need to make a conscious effort to hold the camera in what, to me, is an unnatural way.

Then that POS stopped focusing correctly. Lost out on an entire vacation's worth of quick, convenient photos. And Canon wouldn't fix it. Luckily, had my DSLR backup, which was a pain to lug around. But I digress... Replaced the S90 with the SX260 because I absolutely loved the spectacular shots the S90 produced, especially in low-light conditions. The SX260 has many of those same features, with great zoom and GPS. There are lots of great reviews with pluses and minuses. Here's my bottom line - this thing is compact, 20x zoom, every mode possible, a simple/auto mode, and is as easy or hard as you want it to be! I hope it doesn't go down the same road as the S90, S95, and S100. You can read many great reviews on the entire S-line, but as the cameras age, they start either failing internally, stop focusing accurately, or get the dreaded lens error. Check it out. So instead of jumping the Canon ship, I'm trying the SX260. And so far, it's meeting all my needs for a pocketable, capable, extended zoom camera.

I can take terrific pictures late in the evening with only one distant lamp on, and with the burst mode I can capture my new critters antics and she runs about chasing her mice and other toys.It also has a really nice zoom which I'm looking forward to exploring this spring/summer when it's warm enough for me to go hiking.

And ever since she got it, shes loved it. Im more of a Nikon fan, but she had a Canon before this one so I stuck with what she liked. Her last one was a very small pocket sized one (I dont know the model, i believe a powershot as well), so she first didnt like the slightly bigger size. I always noticed she was never satisfied with photos are longer distances, so I justified the bigger size with getting a longer zoom. Her last camera only did 5x optical zoom, and she hasnt complained about this ones 20x optical zoom. But I still think its extremely pocketable.Image quality is superb. We went to Disneyland one day and took hundreds of photos, during day and night. Super clean, clear, and vivid photos during the day. Some of the effects are neat too. Naturally night photos werent as good, but still were pretty damn great photos. The image stabilization and high sensitivity sensor really makes a difference! The presets for night, day, macro etc. all worked wonderfully as well.

You know, the 'urban legend' of cameras.  I decided on the SX260.  From what I read, an improvement over the older model SX230.  From a very novice photographer and in basic layman's  terms, here's what I have liked, and not liked.Pros:Great pictures with flash, especially outside and in good lighting.  Phenomenal ability to get real clear, real close up photos.  Easy to use buttons and functions.  Each option on the function wheel tells you on the screen what it does.  There is a 'beginner' mode that does all the thinking for you.  The lens is really impressive.  Surprisingly large for such a small camera.  The camera is responsive, but does have a small window of time on multiple shots, that the flash needs to recharge.  When zooming in, the stabilizing feature turns on, to help still the shot.  It is larger than our past compacts, but still small enough to fit in your pocket or handbag.  The display is large (no view finder).  It comes in cool colors.  We got the green, which is more teal in person.  No mistaking it with another.Cons:The shutter speed isn't super quick, but the camera can be placed on a mode that prioritizes that over all other functions.  The battery, so far, has been the biggest disappointment.  We are using the one that came with the camera, but it seemed like we got about a 100 pictures, and a few minutes of video out of it.  We are recharging it again, for a longer period of time to see if that helps.  I also read that turning off the GPS feature and limiting the brightness of the display will help the battery life.  We'll see.  The flash position is supposedly an improvement.  I still find that it pops up under my fingers when taking a photo.  Its probably just a matter of getting used to it and holding the camera differently.  The camera's weak point is indoors in low light.  The photos were a bit grainy.Bottom line:We wanted a portable camera that took both quality video and good photos.  So far, we aren't disappointed.

In May of 2009, I got the first camera in this series, the SX 200, and felt that I finally had the camera for me. It just takes fabulous pictures, is so easy to use, and easy to carry around. It has 12 X optical zoom, which was unbeatable in a compact point and shoot at that time.I've kept my eye on the newer models coming out and haven't been tempted to upgrade until I saw that the SX 260 had a 20 X optical zoom. I was concerned that some of the modes I used regularly on the SX 200 (indoor lighting, landscape) didn't seem to exist anymore, and another mode that I used frequently (portrait) still existed but wasn't accessible through the dial, you have to go through the menu.After a few days of trying this camera, I am just blown away by the image quality. I experimented with different scene modes, but there's really very little need to use anything but auto. The camera just figures out what you want to do. I've gotten a number of incredibly beautiful flower pictures without ever leaving auto mode. If you want macro, you just zoom in on what you want and there it is. If you want pictures of people, it figures that out and adjusts accordingly. The 20 X zoom is phenomenal and, as others have stated, the image stabilization is flawless. I can take pictures one-handed while holding my two dogs' leashes in the other hand as they pull and tug to keep walking, and there's no blur or lack of focus whatsoever in the pictures (I will say this was also true of the SX 200).I've uploaded a couple of images if you want to look at them.Regarding video, I'm of the school that if you want video, use a video camera. I do have a video camera, but I don't use it very often. Generally I prefer still photographs. So, I would use the video in limited situations where something came up that I wanted to capture and I didn't have my video camera with me. I did a little testing of the video and did not hear the whirring and clicking that others reported. The video quality is very good. I did notice that the playback was atrocious using VLC media player - there was a very loud hiss and the images would pixelate and freeze during playback. However, when using Windows media player for playback, the hiss was only slightly audible and significantly reduced, and the video playback was flawless. For the limited occasions that I expect to use the camera for video, it's perfectly adequate for my needs.I've been so happy with the Canon SX 200 that I really hesitated a lot before purchasing the upgrade. Finally I decided to give it a try, knowing that Amazon would take it back if I wasn't happy with it. I'm so happy that I did - I'm extremely pleased with this camera.Oh, I got red, not black, and it's a little more pinkish than I would like, a darker red wold be nicer :) But who cares, a fun color is nice but what really counts is how it performs.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lots of out of focus pictures", "Author": "BackyardBBQ", "ReviewID": "R2N4I3HHS91ZPQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, I am not happy with this camera.

This is a great camera with a lot of features in a small package. I flip around the settings all the time and since the software is relatively the same from camera to camera and generation to generation, the learning curve is small.A few things to the Canon folks if they read these reviews. The program settings have changed drastically over the past 3 generations of the SX lines. They have implemented dedicated modes for things that I don't believe most folks would ever use. I believe that many of these modes should be buried somewhere else. Things like Movie Digest, Super Vivid, and Movie Mode should be available in the SCN mode. And they removed things like Portrait, Landscape, Kids & Pets which I used frequently.I would love to see Canon put a dedicated Low Light mode on the dial instead of Movie Digest or Super Vivid. I find myself requiring the SCN/Low Light option very often at my kids' school functions where I am too far for the flash to be effective, but not enough ambient light to use Auto or other setting. For my wife, I need to talk her through getting the SCN/Low Light option set.Overall the camera is a great option for both pictures and video.

All the professional review sites indicated that the SX260 has the best image quality out of the travel zoom compacts, so I went to a local retailer and purchased it to make sure before I sent back the Sony.  Here's what I found:In bright daylight, the SX260 is a great little camera, it focuses well, takes good, sharp pictures and is very snappy overall.  The build quality is solid, and overall it compares quite favorably to the Sony.  The image quality is slightly better than the Sony's, but overall it's probably is not noticeable for most people.  I did notice though, that the Sony has consistently sharper images across the entire scene, whereas the Canon tends to smudge focus towards the edges more.In lowlight though, it's a completely different story.  The SX260 continuously hunts for focus in anything less than very bright lighting conditions, which means you're going to miss shots that you would otherwise get with a different camera if your subject is moving.  When (or if) it finally does find focus, it often focuses on the wrong subject, especially in complex scenes.  The result is that many pictures wind up with very soft focus which very noticeably degrades image quality, even at small print sizes. This is not an issue with other cameras in this class, such as the Sony or the ZS19.  In a few cases, the Canon could not lock focus period.  I had to go in and manually help it focus or change my position/enable the flash to take some of the shots.  Of course, this was using the auto mode on both cameras, so you can probably get it to focus using the manual controls if you take the time to do so, but since most people will probably leave it in auto 90% of the time, it's a good test to compare the two cameras.The real problem though, is that it can take 10-30 seconds for it to hunt for focus, only for it to wind up failing to focus on anything at all!  Try getting most people to stay still for that long, and you'll see why that can be a BIG problem with this camera.  It's terribly frustrating to have a shot lined up, and then the camera fails to find focus, or worse yet, finds focus in the wrong part of the scene!Overall, the SX260 is a good camera, but the image quality suffers in many situations from focusing issues that it's competitors just don't have.  I'm not sure if there's a definitive, \"best\" camera in this class as it seems that each one has its trade-offs, but I wound up keeping the Sony in the long run, even though it has worse image quality overall than the Canon.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "SX260 camera purchase", "Author": "Donald_1", "ReviewID": "R32RL4KCNDQ1FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera. It rivals my Canon 20D with a 300mm zoom lens. Even at 20X zoom in hand held mode the camera images remain sharp when there is good day time lighting. The wide angle aspect of this camera is also very useful. The flash works exceptionally well and throws light out much farther than the stated 12 feet contained in the user manual. Even if you know nothing at all about cameras you can leave the camera in auto mode and it will produce outstanding results. However, if you're willing to read the user manual of if you are experienced with photography this will be the best camera you ever owned. You can take photos in almost any lighting situation and in any shooting experience.One note of caution, not only for this camera but all cameras, always be careful to check your lens for smudges or dust before you use it. I smudged the lens of my SX260 and it would not focus properly and there was light blooming in the center of each image. It was my fault, of course. Because the camera kept trying to keep good focus and was working the small servo motor used to focus, the batteries wore out and had to be recharged frequently. Once I cleaned the lens this problem disappeared. Don't forget to buy additional batteries for this camera. These smaller Li-Ion batteries tend not to last a long time so if you are going out for a long photo shoot you'll need two or three more charged batteries. I have 10 batteries which I bought for my SX260. I imagine you can probably take 150 to 200 photos with no flash on just one battery. Amazon.com gave me a good price on this item.

The zoomed pics were clear and sharp.  I bought a flexible small tripod which I kept attached throughout the trip so I could steady the camera, especially for the zoom shots. Loved it.  My only negative comment is that when I don't use the tripod I tend to hold the camera on its outer corners to focus and snap and my left finger interferes with the flash popping up.

Seems to work very well.- speed: compared to my sony, the image processor is super fast. no complaints here.- image quality: though there are less megapixels than on my sony, this camera manages to pull off images of almost the same quality- features: this camera has a lot of little features and effects for your image. Once you figure out how to navigate the menu system, these little features are nice and allow you to really play with your image.- GPS: though i don't use it much, it locates you fairly quickly, and works like a charm.CONS- video: the quality is not as good as my sony. not sure if this is because of the lower fps or what, but not too happy with quality.- flash location: The flash is a pop up flash on the left corner of the device, which is right where my finger is when i am holding the camera. Bad design there.The build quality is great, with a nice fit and finish on the camera, and the little grip on the front is nice to have.

I mostly shoot in the program mode, as I fiddle around with the metering with the hot sun in Florida.

The main points I were interested in were a better zoom ( the S100 has only 5X), and the SX's ability to stitch photos into a panorama. The SX is slightly larger and heavier than my S100, but not much. The SX260 has very good zoom, and even at 80X it is clear, though at this magnitude it needs to be put on a tripod for stability. The bad point is the video. There is a constant low level noise, and when I use the zoom during filming, the audio records the clicking of the lens movement also. This is irritating enough for me not to want to use the video, unless I really have to. The bottom line is, if you want a pocketable Canon which is reasonably priced, has good ( noiseless) video, and are not concerned about zoom, I'd go for the S100. I would absolutely NOT buy the SX260 if you want good quality video.

It only had a 4x zoom so I wanted to get a small pocket camera that had a longer zoom range so I picked the 20x SX260 HS after reading numerous reviews about the battery life problems with the SX280. I received the camera within a few days of ordering it and a week before a planned vacation. I tested it to make sure it was in working order. It is very user friendly and similar to my previous camera. I turned the GPS function OFF to save battery life & didn't have to worry about the WiFi feature since it isn't included. I set the pixel resolution for LARGE for the best quality since I usually make a DVD movie/audio disk at year end for each member of my family. I rarely print out pictures since I usually email them or post them to Facebook or other websites. I ordered extra NB-6L batteries to take with me on vacation but never received them. A week after returning home they are still lost and the vendor is issuing me a refund instead of shipping another set of batteries. My only complaint for this camera is the flash unit. When the camera is set to AUTO the flash pops up when needed. If your hand or finger is on the top left rear of the camera it prevents the flash unit from popping up & you may have to shut the camera off & turn it on before the flash can fire. When I know I must use the flash especially in a sunny back lighted situation I set the camera in LIVE mode & then set the dial to have the flash ON for the shot. The flash then pops up and is ready to fire & you don't have to worry about your hand or fingers being in the way. I shot some VIDEO and had no problem with the low battery light coming on. I had to charge the battery once during a two week period & lost some photo opportunities since I didn't have an extra charged battery with me. I haven't loaded the software CD yet so that will be next along with downloading the SD card onto my computer to view the picture and video files. I would like to see an optical viewfinder on this camera, since it is practically impossible to see anything on the LCD in bright sunlight. This is true of every LCD camera  even with a fold down attachable LCD shade that I have used on my SD1400. The only other item I purchased was a set of LCD protective shields cut to the exact size for this camera. I was wiping off fingerprints, water & suntan lotion constantly & I am sure these screens helped protect the LCD from scratches & damage. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this camera, especially the 20x zoom. Although I also ordered the  suggested CaseLogic case for the camera, I never used it since the camera was always in one of the pants pockets of my cargo shorts for easy retrieval. Portability was a priority and this camera is perfect. I didn't want a huge SLR to cart around while fishing, at the beach or pool, or visiting bars, restaurants or attractions with family and friends. It was easy to hand to a waitress or stranger to take your picture & stick in your pocket or wife's handbag  when not needed. It's an excellent choice for a small point & shoot camera that has some great features and is easy to use.

Indoors with existing light leaves something to be desired as slow shutter speed causes subjects to be blurred quite often.  Outdoors in daylight is fine.  There is also a shutter lag with flash indoors so if you are taking pictures with fast moving kids or animals multiple shots are required to get a good picture.  GPS is somewhat iffy. I have had it lock on quickly in cities with tall buildings and fail in open spaces where you would think it would have no problem.  It normally does a very good job of exposure and focus.

The old one took great pictures, but noise or artifacts started to show up in the pictures in the form of dots here and there.  Then bought another one for her mother few years later.Right away, when she started using the new camera, she noticed that it took great, sharp pictures.  What the difference was that by just using the auto setting, the pictures came out great, effortlessly.  No need to fuss with the settings for anything particular.  The camera did the adjustments quite accurately, enough.The camera is full of useful features.  One I was interested in was the burst modes, where you can take several shots in a row.  I took a sequence shot of my kid jumping off from a swing.  It captured the path that she took to where she landed in the sand.I've read comments about noises/hissing with video mode.  We never noticed any noises until I compared the second SX260 with my old Sanyo video camera.  Sure enough, there was hissing.  Then I compared the first SX260 and the same hissing was there as well.I don't know if the hissing I heard is the same as ones mentioned in other comments, though.  But it wasn't bad enough that we didn't even realize until they were compared.There were other comments about speed.  This camera can be fast in bright settings, but will yield poor/blurred images in darker situations.  I'd guess that this is related to the size of the optical sensor where the light is absorbed.  So, (in simplified form) if you have lots of light, the \"shutter\" speed can be fast, but with low light, the shutter has to be slower.  Therefore, blurred images.So, this camera may not be for taking sports scenes in all types of lighting.  Find a camera with much larger sensor(s) if you want to take fast action shots.Lastly, this camera has been obsoleted a while ago when the SX280 came out.  It turns out that the SX280 is inferior to SX260 in quality.  They have low ratings for being a \"lemon.\"  So, at that time of purchase, SX280 was selling for much less than the SX260.  That is if you can find SX260 any more.  The SX260 seems to be getting harder to find, so I was afraid that some of the stores that are still selling these, may be the last of the returned items.  They could be defective/refurbished, or last of the leftover stocks.  The one I got turned out fine.  Everything seems to be in order.

It takes good pictures and is fairly easy to use.  I'm just a casual user who prefers to point and shoot, not interested in being a professional photographer.  I tend to not use most of the special features of the camera, but at least they are there if I want them.  I did accidentally discover the Movie Digest setting, which turned out to be pretty cool.  I didn't realize the setting had gotten bumped to that and to my surprise when I went to play back the pictures I had taken at a concert, I had gotten a little movie with clips from various parts of the concert where I had taken a still picture.  I knew the camera had some sort of feature like that but had never investigated it.  A neat feature that I will use again.Other features that I like are the size of the screen, the 20x zoom and the wide angle lens.The only cons I can think of are 1) it has a proprietary battery, which I knew when I purchased it and debated about, but so far it hasn't been too much of a problem since I try to keep it charged knowing that I can't simply put in new disposable batteries in a pinch, and 2) the flash is a bit awkward, as it suddenly pops up when needed, right where your finger is.  I've learned to expect it and have gotten used to it but it never fails to surprise someone else when I have them take a picture for me.  It's kind of like when the Jack-In-The-Box pops up, lol.

As my longest lens is a 75-300 mm lens (APS-C equivalent 112-450 MM), I wanted a replacement camera with at least that long of a focal length. I also wanted something that could replace my JVC camcorder as well. As my wife already owned a Canon PowerShot SD850is I was familiar with their build and quality.  I found the camera easy to use and enjoyed not having to be changing lens every time I wanted to zoom in or out on a subject. I am not a professional photographer so can not qualitatively report on the quality of my pictures, but I feel they are as good as any I have taken with my Maxxum 5D or previously to that the Minolta 35 mm SLR I still own. The video was extremely good as well. The only complaint I have is the placement of the flash. It is on top of the camera where my left hand index finger would sit, thus would hit my finger and not extract fully every time I needed the flash.

After reading about a lot of the new ones with touch screens - something I did not want - I decided to try the SX 260 HS 12.1 MP, and it is terrific.  It's still small enough and light enough, but has a 20x optical zoom which is nothing short of fantastic.  I've seen others complain that it is blurry, but that is if you go past the 20x optical into the digital zoom, which is of course going to blur.  You can clearly see the limits of the 20x optical zoom if you look at the bar indicating the zoom strength being used.  One thing I would say is the picture shows the lens with no cover, and mine has the same type of protective onion-layered type of cover that has been on my other PowerShot Elphs by Canon.  No worries.  It is definitely a great buy and another great camera by Canon.  p.s. I still love my little 100HS so much I ordered another one just because.  For the money these can't be beat.

I have had several Canons in the past and had always been pleased with each of them. My  Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) did not disappoint. The images are very clear, the controls easy to use and the performance is usually fast (some caveats in low light, flash photography especially with a battery that needs charging). I love the small size, being compact enough to carry in my front pocket while I hike or travel. I was able to get alot of great shots during the travels for which I purchased the camera. I continue to enjoy it for every day pics, hikes, travel, skiing,...BUT---The reason that I felt prompted to write this review is due to my experience these past two weeks with Canon's repair department. About 10 days ago I noticed that I could not use my self-timer as that functionality of the control dial had apparently broken since my last usage (a hike a couple of weeks ago). Using Canon's support website I very quickly ascertained that the product was still under warranty (Yay!) and could be returned for repair. The online forms were quite easy to fill out and in a snap I had the camera sent off. I received a confirmation email within a couple of days as well as two more emails within the next week keeping me informed on the status of my repair. Due to the nature of the malfunction, Canon chose to replace the product, at no cost to me. I received it via FedEx today. It is labeled as \"refurbished\" but looks brand new. All the parts were in the box as if it were new and it works like a charm, just like it did previously. Also, in the course of my repair I had occasion to call the Canon repair center in Irvine and both times was treated very efficiently and with friendly service. I was very impressed with the entire repair experience and will definitely favor Canon's products for my future purchases as I have found them to have the best feature sets as well as superior customer service.

If you hold the camera naturally and the camera thinks it needs a flash, it has a motor that pushes the flash up.  If you block the flash as it comes up, you get an error message that requires taking the battery out to clear.  Solution?  I haven't found one.  They should have spring-loaded the flash.

I bought this camera at $200, and it's been solid.  Canon cameras have two weaknesses, in my opinion-- longer shutter lag and a little bit worse battery life than some competitors.  I have also found that when other people use this camera, the pictures tend to come out \"soft\" because they move too soon, before the lens has closed.  That being said, the zoom with image stabilization works great and the basic settings are very easy to change if needed.  The picture quality indoor tends to be a little washed out at times with the flash set to auto-- I leave it adjusted two settings lower than full flash to compensate for that (I just leave it set that way for all pictures unless my subject is 12+ feet away).  Outdoor pictures are awesome.I have an DSLR camera for more advanced functions, but I think this SX260 is a good choice for most people.

The clarity can be excellent at times, and the color pops. I like that it has manual/aperture/shutter priority options. It allows for more creativity. I'm still working on discovering every nook and cranny in the settings but there seems to be a wide variety. I had fun playing around with the slow motion video setting. I like that the camera came with a cord to hook up to the computer via USB. That is extremely helpful and it works fast. The LCD screen is nice and large and it's very bright (of course you can change how bright you want it). My Cybershot memory stick Pro duo doesn't fit into the Canon. However, if you have a micro-sd card with an adapter, it fits right into the Canon and works perfectly. I'm glad I discovered that because I didn't want to go out and buy another memory card. I spent too much money as it is.Cons:All of these cons are superficial. Everything is in perfect condition, these are just my observations and preferences.The flash is kind of annoying at times. I'm used to having my finger where it pops up. I also find that the autofocus is a bit slow. Again, I'm still figuring things out, but it seems that it doesn't always focus on what you want it to. I've handed the camera over to friends to take a photo and sometimes it will just come out blurry. This camera is also heavy. I compared it to my Sony Cybershot and the Canon is probably about 1.5x heavier. Not a great addition to my already heavy hand-bag. The power button is in a weird spot. It should be on the opposite side of the shutter button. I've had friends try to take a picture and shut the camera off. It's just an odd spot for the power button. The camera beeps and noises are quite annoying, so I just shut them off.Overall, I'd say this is a great camera.

Also never buy from best buy bh photo you get quality I can beat my chest about how long I've been a photographer but I've found buying from bh I never had a problem also this camera is not for the amateur photographer  you will find this camera complex and hard to you use, buy a lower series camera. I bought this camera for the features and you can't beat 20x optical zoom. The only thing I wish was different was the feel of the buttons my sx230 had raised buttons where the sx260 the buttons seem more into the body of the camera. But this does help with keeping the camera smoother and easier to slide in and out of pockets as a good travel should be able to do. One last thing  make sure the GPS logger is off and buy a second battery due to the large zoom it does eat battery's quicker than a typical point and shoot should.

I may have to read it to figure out the stitch assist mode, but otherwise, it's pretty straight forward.Two things really stand out with this camera.  First, the lens is very big for such a small camera, and the zoom is amazing.  Second, it takes the best low light photos I've ever seen.  I'm guessing the image stabilizer helps with that.It has its limitations, but so far, I'm in love with it.  I also like the color I bought.  I got the Red camera, but don't let the name fool you.

The fastest delivery I have ever had - great job Amazon!For the camera itself, I am still exploring all the functions. One feature that was attractive to me based on the reviews I read is its versatility in manual settings, in addition to automatic or pre-set functions. I have not explored that part much yet, but I have tested and have been enjoying a few tricks that this camera has. I like pre-set effects such as the fish-eye, miniature, vivid colours and night-shots. I think its night pictures are particularly good.To be honest, initially I was gravitating towards the Sony camera but bought this because of the good price. But I do think they are more or less the same, so the more difference in the price, the more reasons to go with Canon. For anyone in the same dilemma, I would not go for Sony Cyber-shot if it is more than $30-40 more expensive.Overall, I am very pleased with my choice, I think it is great value for money and very versatile.

Not to mention all the photos that my old canon 5x just couldn't quite bring to life!!  I'm finding this camera in my purse on my dash & ready for the moment...  I am super amazed that I can take some of these photos and they turn out really good...  I'm not a professional and only take photos of family and things that catch my eye, so when I capture the moment it still surprises me!  This camera is easy for the amateur and has more to offer even the experienced photographer.  I've only touched the surface of all the interesting things this camera can do.  The quality of my inside photos without flash really surprise me, where the camera finds the light I don't know...  but I Love not having to wash out people with too much light.  I have used the flash & it is powerful, for the really dark situations it works perfectly.  My outdoor photos of people, animals and scenery all turn out really nice and when I enlarge a photo and frame it family have asked where I purchased them!!  shhhh...  it's our secret.  My Canon sx260 is my go everywhere camera, small enough for my purse or even a pocket.  I've taken photos of a local pageant from about 40 feet away, using only the stage lights (no flash), zoomed in and came out like I was taking them from on stage.  It's nice to know I can take wedding photos in a church, without noise or flash, spoiling the moment!  I Love my Canon sx260.

After spending $100 to $1,400 on cameras, I was stunned to see how great the pictures and videos came out. The description of all the other functions of this camera are listed, but I think the first reviewer here nailed the camera's qualities. It is an easy point `n shoot camera with some extras. The GPS is a gimmick, but it does work well in placing your photos if you want to display them on GOOGLE Earth. However, the housing restricts that feature. The 12.1 megapixels are great for even posters or flat screen televisions (I use mine through my Blu-ray disc player for YOUTUBE). The function set, display, menu and the dial are all easy and intuitive. The zoom is remarkably steady (I recommend a small tripod). I've never cared for Optical Zoom, but the 20X works as well as any.This is really a remarkable camera for the price. I have yet to test the stereo microphones, but I can imagine that for the family filmmaker, this might be fun to watch and listen to on a television with stereo speakers. The software that is included is also very simple but important.

When I decided to update my camera, I did my research and the SX260HS came up as one of the best options.  I bought it in October from Amazon, and have used it for a couple months now.  All in all, I absolutely hate this camera.  Among other things - such as a ridiculously short battery life - the pictures are horrible.People in the side or top of the photo have either warped faces or elongated heads.  If people are moving, they show up as a blurry 'streak' in the photo.  Looking at my recent Christmas photos, I'd say that maybe 1 out of 10 actually turned out.  (and yes, I've checked the settings twice now, and they seem to be correct)I'm going to call Canon, as maybe it's a mechanical issue that's under warranty - you never know.  But as it stands right now, I would absolutely 100% not recommend this camera to anyone.(UPDATE:  Following the above review, I sent it in for warranty work.  Appears there was a problem with the camera, which would probably account for the problems I was experiencing.  For their part, Canon's warranty process was excellent, and I got my camera back VERY quickly.  Haven't really used it since, so can't comment on how a properly-functioning camera works.)(UPDATE #2:  Had a chance to use it during spring break.  The outdoor pictures (sunshine, blue sky, etc) are amazing.  The indoor pictures (with and without a flash) still don't seem that good.  Still some blurry streaks, out of focus, and quite a delay from when you press the button & it takes the picture.

After a two week vacation with it overseas as my first real use of it I have to say that I am impressed with the size/weight of the package, the quality of the pictures, the acceptable speed of operation, the battery life, the image stabilization, and the zoom.I was expecially pleased with how the 20x optical zoom and the image stabilization seem to work together.  I had no problems zooming the full 20x and shooting crisp, clear photos.  Going beyond 20x -- using the in camera digital zoom -- didn't work quite as well expecially beyond 30x, but in many cases was acceptable.Speed of operation is acceptable but just barely so -- this with a 32 GB Type 10 SDHC card.Battery life is reasonable -- I was able to shoot a full day of photos (100-120)with mixed flash on a single fully-charged battery.  I also purchased two of the after-market batteries and kept those with me, but never had to switch out during the day (although I came close a couple of times).Regarding controls, the camera is comfortable to hold and the control layout is acceptable.  I did have one problem with the auto-focus fighting me for a picture of a church steeple framed by trees -- the closer trees kept fooling the auto-focus to give them preference.

I got a bit compulsive about snapping photos when I owned a Canon PowerShot SD 4000 IS (the box says \"Digital Elph\") . Purchased in, like, 2007, I think. Perfect camera for me. I loved the smooth, slim shape, and how the controls were easy to manipulate one-handed. Seriously, I have great photos that I've taken while biking, horseback riding, walking the dog...And the best thing about that old camera was Canon's low-light technology. I have so many fun shots from just whipping out the camera at parties or in bars or even around campfires -- no flash, and they all come out great. The camera is like a cat's eye or something, the way it can use ambient lighting to illuminate indoor/dusky photos that otherwise would come out dark. As a candid image shooter, I rely on the element of surprise/spontaneity. So when I broke my old SD 4000 IS (my bad entirely), I definitely wanted another Canon with the same low-light technology!Canon had introduced a lot of new products since I purchased my old \"digital Elph\" so I had a hard time figuring out which new model to go with. My two main issues: I wanted the low-light tech & I wanted something very small & portable & discreet. I sketched out the measurements for this model on paper before ordering. It actually appeared a little smaller than my old SD 4000....In person though, ugh. It's a stout little thing. Heavy!! Clunky in my hand. Controls aren't nearly as intuitive for me. Hard to find a good case for it, the one I bought along with the camera is a tight, tight squeeze which is nice protection I guess but makes it hard for me to just whip out the camera on a whim.Takes great pics but they're HUGE. I use the \"burst\" function when I take candids so I get like a dozen at once and then pick out the best ones to name & post, right? Well with this camera, I am eating up memory cards, I needed to buy a bigger system backup package, ugh....Other stuff I didn't like: eats up batteries (compared to my old SD 4000, that is). And it's a bit slower than my old camera, when you hold down the button to take a bunch of shots at once, there's considerably more lag. I am not a big fan of all the options, either. Fish eye lens? Really? I'd rather less functions, more functionality.But not a bad camera, at all. Just little too much for this casual picture-taker.

It does take pretty good photos in good light and has a great zoom range, but the controls are terrible.  The multifunction wheel is dreadful.  Trying to use the rotary function while adjusting one parameter is impossible without accidentally activating one of the several other menus that it also controls. For example, when Manual Focus is selected, rotating the dial will inevitably activate another unwanted menu such as the self timer or compensation function.  It is essentially impossible to use the manual focus without changing other settings unintentionally.  Or likewise, adjusting the compensation by rotating the dial will ususally result in another menu being opened and that parameter changed unintentionally.  In addition, the autofocus is worthless for close-ups and macro work.  I have spent many infuriating moments trying to take photos of flowers and the camera is completely unable to focus.

After reading all the raving reviews, viewing countless sample photos, and researching the competing cameras, I went to Best Buy and purchased the SX260.I'm disappointed but I want to love this camera really bad because it has everything I was looking for, or so I thought: great optical zoom, great image quality and stunning colors, black and white shooting mode, compact point-and-shoot style.So why am I disappointed? Because of the image quality. Seriously I'm feeling a bit alone in my opinion after reading through the other reviews to see if I'm loosing my mind but to me the image quality is well below standard. Low light, bright light, optimal light, any setting, flash or no-flash, the images seem to be blurry. Not blurry like going without your glasses blurry but not sharp, crisp. For example a shot with my Sony with 5X zoom was so clear I could zoom in and crop and still keep amazing detail. When I took it to New York City I took some amazing shots at night from the Empire State Building without a tripod, just resting it on the concrete wall. With the Canon, night time shots of the city are near impossible and forget zooming in on any shot regardless of the lighting. Once you zoom in you'll see distortion, smoothing, dull images.In summary, this Canon is well built, easy to use and user friendly. Loaded with features and shooting modes. The 80X digital zoom is very impressive and the built in image stabilization works surprisingly well. The image quality is left to the eye of the beholder and to me it significantly lacks, especially for the price of this camera. Video quality is decent to great depending on lighting but expect to get a lot of inner mechanical noise feedback.

I very nearly returned it, though, and have resigned myself to it with mixed feelings. Because there are so many options to tweedle with that I'm not sure I've mastered them, I won't lay down an absolute verdict on everything that dissatisfies me about the camera, but I have to let out a yowl over the funhouse mirror effect in the corners of the wide-angle images. People's hair-dos and heads splurge into the corners like lava lamp blobs, and I find myself having to throw away some of my favorite compositions (unless you like the cliche tourist snapshot with your subjects centered against that sunset or mountain range, you want to frame them toward the side, in which case, you can take the shot but won't want to show it to anybody who knows the person in the upper left or right hand corner). The auto-white balance is very untrustworthy indoors, the default the colors are surreally intense and over warm (as has become the standard it seems) and to my surprise the artificial intelligence can't tell you're under trees on an overcast day, so I have to stop down in order not to overexpose my photos. Even though there are many options, there is no mode that gives you all of them, so you don't get to take advantage of everything you might like. I find I can't easily stay away from the high ASA settings, over which the sharpness drops steeply. Partly it's just a slow lens even at wide angle, but also it seems pumping up the ASA to 1200 or higher is the camera's favorite way to get the exposure right. I also miss the spot-focus/spot-metering button of my old Canon (you have to enter the everything menu to do anything), and wish it either told me or had a stop mid-zoom for the equivalent of a standard lens (i.e. neither fish-eye nor telephoto). What else? It's not nearly so small and light as the less zoomy point-and-shoots--I was particularly surprised by how heavy it is--and it's just absurd how you're forced to hold the camera to avoid blocking the popup flash (fortunately for me, I don't use flash much, and just set it to off).

I didn't put the Sony HX20 in the 'race' because I found it's image quality to be subpar, although it seems to have better video capability (which is not rather important to me), nor the Nikon S9300, because of it's lack of manual controls (PASM).After a lot of research and some quick hands-on experience (I was lucky to find some people who let me use their cameras for a short while), it was very difficult to choose - all three are GREAT pocket cameras.I'm not a touch-screen type of person, I have big fingers, and I find it easier to navigate using buttons, specially in shaky environments (moving vehicles and such), but I have to agree that the Panasonic ZS20 has a cleaner working area.In the end, I valued the zoom range more than the larger sensor, so I had to drop the Canon S100. If I shot more indoors, and had a deeper pocket, the S100 would have a far better chance.After some pixel-peeping and *very* close inspection, I decided that the pictures from the Canon SX260 had a slightly better contrast and color vibrance than the ones from the Panasonic ZS20.In the end, they both performed great, yielding fantastic pictures and videos, most of them keepers. I ended up choosing the Canon SX260, mainly because it felt better in my hands, its price was a bit lower and the zoom reached a tad farther than the ZS20.Now for the ugly part: Amazon has a terrible habit of pushing its prices through the roof when their inventory is low - when I was in the market for the camera, the price here was $279, and everywhere else was $229 or lower. I finally got it at $209 at a flash sale, at Walmart. Once again, shame on you, Amazon! I would have waited, had you just told me 'more are on their way', and offered me a better price.----------------------------------Update - March 23rd 2013: I have shot over 500 pictures with my camera, and although I already knew that battery life was rather short, I didn't realize exactly what that meant.

I plan to learn to use all of the camera's many features on a 3 week trip this summer so might amend this review in a few months.All in all, I feel it's a great small camera at a good price.CONS OR REASONS WHY I DO NOT GIVE IT 5 STARS:As many reviewers have noted, inexplicably, it does not come with a memory card, which I liken to buying a new car but having to pay extra for tires. At least Canon could include a 1 GB SD Card to get a photographer started.Battery Life: As stated in the Getting Started guide, the expected number of shots per fully charged battery is 230 or 70 minutes of continuous shooting time. So far, I have not barely reached half of those expected standards before the battery is discharged. Obviously, using the flash or zoom, both of which I do extensively, greatly decreases the battery's life.Lack of a Printed Manual: Yes, I am old school and one can certainly use this camera without reading the manual but I firmly believe that purchasers deserve to receive a printed manual, not just a CD to either read on-screen, or to print out with expensive ink on a personal printer. Note that I am very eco-conscious also and religiously reduce, reuse, re-purpose and recycle and do not print any more than I have to...Bottom line, I paid $20 for a printed manual which i believe is the manufacturer's responsibility to furnish me.

If I am not using it as a compact camera anyway, something a bit larger and more ergonomic would have been better.  Plus - and this is my fault - I should have gone by Target or somewhere and felt the camera - a mistake I won't make again.  I bought this because it was rated highly on Amazon and by a consumer magazine, but overall think I should have spent the extra $100 and moved up.  I would suggest putting any camera in your hands before you buy it - lesson learned.If you want a camera with a nice zoom to take outdoor pics of your kids, this is a good one, but for birthday parties and other indoor uses, based on my personal experience here my suggestion is look elsewhere, as the speed and quality of the flash photos left us disappointed.

Lae", "ReviewID": "R2UAVI5QIC09K6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am stunned that this camera has such high ranking feedback. I assume the picture quality is very good (I've yet to download and see my photos.) The issue is--TAKING THE PHOTOS! Good luck. There's multiple huge issues: The mechanical FLASH is placed exactly where most people hold the camera with their left hand. The shutter release button is right next to the Power on/off switch on the right side top of the camera. AGAIN? After All These Years!? How long have digital cameras been around now? I remember having this crazy-making issue (accidentally shutting the camera off rather than snapping the photo) on cameras years and years ago. After inadvertenly shutting the camera off, now you have the ten second restart cycle and the picture is gone. WHY HAS CANON NOT LEARNED THIS? (Yes, the power button is shaped differently. So what? When taking a picture, one's left and right brain are most likely occupied with the subject and the picture.) I'll tell you why the on/off button is next to the shutter--because the engineers put it there and do not care about what the consumers/users want or need. It's a classic example of \"The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity\"--This is a book written over ten years ago and available here on Amazon. BTW, I am an engineer with an MSEE---I know when I see tech decisions that totally ignore common street smarts. (I owned a Ford Explorer where the change holder was immediately next to the CD player cartridge door. Coins would fall into the player and destroy it. Ford's solution---they placed a sticker on the CD player which read: DO NOT DROP COINS INTO THE CD PLAYER--making it YOUR PROBLEM.) 'pretty bad, but it really gets worse. The brilliant, crack engineering team put the flash unit (which mechanically rises out of the camera) on the exact opposite (top left) side of the camera, where most everybody (symmetrically) holds the camera. Your right hand/finger are on the right at the shutter/power button, and your left hand/finger are now on the left side, covering the flash unit. SHAME ON YOU! So what happens? You're trying to get a picture off---you're lucky enough not to shut the camera off with the power button, then the flash struggles to pop up through your finger...then it jams. Not only is the picture lost---but it gets user-unfriendly WORSE from here. The camera's software now goes into an error mode. The flash can no longer be used with the camera. An ERROR MESSAGE comes up on the screen telling you that you must restart the camera before the FLASH can be used again. WOW!! I'm writing this from the floor. Really? Imagine if airline software or even automobile software was written this way. You'd have to pull off the road and restart the car because you didn't get your seatbelt on right. WHY can't the software itself reboot without your attention?  BTW: Canon's solution to this: MAKE IT YOUR PROBLEM: In the instruction manual they tell you how you should hold the camera---palm down under the bottom. Really? Good thing Canon does not (re)design forks or knives. We'd be holding them in some foreign way. So now, again, you are in a power-recycle mode trying to get a picture taken. FRUSTRATING frustrating FRuStRaTiNg! We want to take pictures of our ACTIVE five year old. The reason I bought this specific camera after hours of research was because its response time was supposedly quick. We completely miss the shots with all this nonsense---and guess what? Its response time is miserable anyway---pathetic---even if you manage to get your fingers in all of the right places. Lastly (in the physically ridiculous department) the battery goes in MORE EASILY backwards. One needs to struggle to get it in correctly. It's easier to \"plop\" it in backwards. You only then know it's backwards because it will not seat the remaining 5% of the way down. YIKES again! I am so disappointed with this design-disaster. I believe the optical/electronic engineers did their job, but the interface engineers were out to lunch. Shameful---after years and years of people using cameras, they ignore how people use cameras and the booby traps that they so easily fall into. I want to cry or smack a designer after all of the time and trouble I put into choosing this camera FOR MY WIFE for Christmas. Rather than showing her how easy it is to use, I have to show her the many things to avoid, watch out for, and how to RECOVER from the problem once engaged.

Otherwise it calibrates microphone to catch every lightest sound, even the sound of inner mechanism). Others wrote already enough about the camera itself, so I just want to provide some hints about protecting it.I've checked many of camera cases and I found 3 which fit the best - snugly but not too tight:Lowepro - Newport 10 - it's just simply pouch with zippered main compartment and zippered front pocket (which can accommodate spare memory card and battery without getting bulky). Pros - price; cons - only not-so-convenient sewn-on loop on back (makes necessary to unbuckle belt, strap, e.g.).NO shoulder strap, nor possibility to attach one! But it's more than OK if you plan to carry it only in your purse or on your belt.Case Logic DCB-302 - nice, well-padded case. Main pocket zippered, so is an additional front pocket (with internal slip for memory card - nice!). On the picture this case looks more bulky than it really is. In fact even with 2 spare batteries it doesn't get fat. Sew-on belt loop and detachable shoulder strap. Pros - price, padding, shape; cons - permanent belt loop, plastic (somehow cheap) hooks on shoulder strap.LowePro Rezo 30 - zippered main compartment with soft lining (it opens wide - careful not to drop camera!). Two zippers allow you to lay out the camera strip outside and carry it in the case on your wrist (and that's additional option - always nice to have!). Front pocket (w/ internal slip) has Velcro flap opening (too bad it gets awkwardly bulky with anything else than one battery inside). Pros - high quality materials, well refined details (e.g. stretchable gussets provide a tight fit with easy access), unfastening Velcro belt loop (but with a snap to make sure it won't open by itself!), doubled zippers in main compartment; cons - bulky front pocket, somehow too widely opening main compartment (learn not to open it all the way and you're OK).I've heard Tamrac 3821 Neo's Digital 21 is also a good fit if you prefer Velcro flap opening rather than zippered one. But front pocket doesn't have the separate closing and isn't extremely big. It has belt loop too (but I don't know if it's opening) and shoulder strap. Pros - easy, fast access, cons - price (4 times DCB-302 and twice Rezo 30!) small front pocket.Warning - Case Logic TBC-302 FFP is too tight (unless you have a few minutes each time you take the camera out or in. But I bet in long run it will make more harm than protection...)", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's OK", "Author": "Nancy Alexander", "ReviewID": "R36HHLXGEDPKEA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is OK.

Next, it is not nearly as user friendly as the Coolpix.  My Coolpix had lots of settings for beach/snow/nighttime,dusk,dawn,backlight, close up and many other things.  After having used this Canon for almost two weeks in New York City and visiting my grandchildren in New Jersey I really got frustrated.The booklet that comes with the Canon is nearly worthless.  With my past Nikons I got a nice full book that was really helpful.  I am going to when I have time go online to the Canon website and see if I can get some help in finding out if this camera has some of the features that I named above as they are important.Unless I can get some help in finding features that I need if they are even on this camera then my next camera will be another Nikon Coolpix.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Major Let Down !

I have been comparing various ones online and reading all the customer reviews. I figured out that the SX260 and the SX50 are basically the exact same camera but in two different classes. So I went with this SX260 because of the price difference.I take lots of pictures and I not a professional by any means. I found that the fish eye option is absolutely ridiculous unless you are taking a picture of a tree lined path or street and want it to appear like a tunnel. There is no landscape option which might seem fine but then leaves the user trying to figure out which setting is a good option for those scenic shots. I tested out the optical zoom and while it does get you up close and personal to a far off object it does not take a great picture of said object. I also noticed that the camera is jumpy. I don't have any visible hand shaking problems but getting this camera to stay on a stationary object that you are zoomed in on can be trying. I didn't notice any difference between the normal portrait mode or the smooth portrait mode. If you choose the vivid option be forewarned that your colors will become over saturated. I noticed that if I tried to take a macro picture of a flower while being 2'-5' from the subject that the camera would not focus on it. However if I was standing in my yard and trying to take a picture of a neighbor's flower in their yard (maybe 20') that macro was fine. (My A650 has absolutely no problems doing this). There is an option called \"live\" which lets you adjust three things in your picture and I found no advantage for this unless you would like to pretend that you are taking a picture at twilight when it is actually noon.I would not recommend this camera based on all my above findings.

A week later the camera was returned with a note: \"We are unable to repair your camera as this model was not intended for sale the US\" (??!!!!???)  I was floored.  I bought the camera from Amazon (through a third party seller), new, under the assumption I would have a valid one year warranty.  I contacted the seller multiple times, but to no avail. I continually received the \"you are past your returnable date\" party line.Over the next couple months, I continued to file claims, repeal their denials etc.  Ultimately Amazon was able to get someone at Ritz Camera to agree to accept the return and I got my money back.  It certainly wasn't easy, and took A LOT of my time on the phone and through emails.I have no idea if this was an issue with Amazon, the seller, or the camera in general.

However, the color is more of a hot pink and it is heavier than I wanted. It also has a stiff wrist strap that I don't care for.  I thought it was around my wrist when I took a pix at the fair but what I felt was instead, my just-purchased ride bracelet so when I finished taking a pix, I dropped it onto the asphalt!!  It damaged a corner of the view finder and now I have a big black spot covering what I am taking on my finder.  It however does not affect the pixs taken.  I sent it back to Canon to be repaired when the tech said it would be about $100.  When the estimate came in, it was about $239 plus shipping and handling. (250.00!!) In no way would I pay for this camera almost twice!  So be careful!  It does take great pixs in the 17 days I had it :(", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unusable after 1st week", "Author": "Lori Duperon", "ReviewID": "R36OV4IAW3R1XC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had Canon cameras for more than 8 years and they still work.
