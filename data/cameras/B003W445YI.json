The Look is very sleek and modern.

But the reason I didn't buy it last time was the price. So I bought the other one even though I like this one. Unfortunately, that one was broken suddenly without any damage. I didnt know the reason and that seller didn't want to be responsible for that camera. I was so angry. Then I bought this one. It works well. I like this color with touching screen. I haven't found any problem until now.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Supplied Accessories - Rechargeable Battery (NP-BN1), Battery Charger, Multi Connector Cable, wrist Strap, Paint Pen, CD-ROMFeatures\nUltra-slim body\n3.0 Touch screen for easy focus selection & photo viewing\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x (25mm-equivalent) optical zoom lens\nOptical SteadyShot(R) image stabilization", "Name": "Sony T Series DSC-T99/V 14.1 Megapixel DSC Camera with Super HAD CCD Image Sensor (Violet)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eshuOjMXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003W445YI"}}
