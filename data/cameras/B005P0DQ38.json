Thought it was a great idea to be able to use the camera strap for the case strap. The problem with that was as soon as you took the camera out all the extra stuff you carry in the bag, like the spare batteries, fall out. This proved to be very problematic when taking pictures from the top decks of a cruise ship! The small tripod was not very useful either, the camera is too heavy and could support it very well. All other accessories were ok.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$38.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 7 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon Coolpix 9623 Digital Camera Case +\n<2> Transcend 8GB Class 4 SD Card + <3> PD 4x AA Batteries & Charger +\n<4> PD-T14 Flexible Camera Tripod + <5> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<6> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <7> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix 9623 Digital Camera Case with 8GB Card + (4) Batteries & Charger + Tripod + Accessory Kit for L24, L26, L110, L120, L810 & S30", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51t-mCl6K2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005P0DQ38"}}
