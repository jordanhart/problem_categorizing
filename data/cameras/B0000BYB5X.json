{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well built", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3SF6AP5DEROJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched for a digital camera for two months before I finally ordered the Minolta.  I previously owned a 3mp Olympus but I wanted a good zoom lens and at least a 5MP Sensor.  I have had this camera for a month and my pictures are getting better with each use.  The build quality of this camera is superb.  There is nothing else out there for this price that is built like it.  I looked at the Fuji Finepix 7000 but decided even though the resolution was higher, after holding one in my hand it wasn't the camera for me. The Fuji was very light and made of plastic.  The Minolta is made of metal and fits the hand well.  I do want to tell anyone considering this camera that it can be VERY confusing to a beginner.  It can be used just fine in \"auto\" mode as a point and shoot, but to get the most out of it you have to experiment a bit with all the other settings.  Luckily I have a friend that is a professional photographer to help me with questions.The main reason I bought this camera is because of it's Anti-Shake function.  The sensor makes adjustments for a shaky hand, and that would be MY hands, not the steadiest of all.  This is the only pro-sumer camera offering this technology at this time and I felt it was definately a \"must have\" feature.  My 66 year old mother took a very good picture of me with it right out of the box.  One of my 10 year old students took some pretty impressive pictures also.PROS- Anti-Shake Function; Magnesium Body; Great Zoom lens; Good feel in the handCONS- A bit high priced...but falling; 5MP sensorI have already decided that I will buy the upgrade of the A1 as soon as it is released.", "Date": "December 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "Simply Fantastic!", "Author": "Rosalind Wells", "ReviewID": "R1NK9PDXRFPA4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a real photographer's camera; not point-and-shoot (although it works fine like that!). Lots of knobs on it, but that makes it very quick to use in the field (once you get used to it). Other cameras have fewer buttons and so you have to scroll through menus - very slow and frustrating! It's smaller than an SLR, but it's not a compact camera by any means. Very light for its size (540g), and well made (metal body - not plastic). It provides complete manual control of all parameters; very straightforward and well-designed. It's a joy to use. The first camera I've really felt at home with. One of the best things about it (apart from anti-shake) is the fact that you see the final picture in the amazingly bright and detailed viewfinder. It's really easy to fiddle with exposure to get the right balance of tones; you just look through the viewfinder and alter aperture or shutter speed until you get what you want. Amazing for sunsets; no guessing - just tweak until you see the photo you want in the viewfinder. Idiot proof really.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this camera.", "Author": "Parront", "ReviewID": "R22GXYBXN0HYZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a year ago. I love the fact that a lot of the settings can be changed without going into the menu. The anti-shake feature is very helpful as I am a senior citizen with severe arthritis of the shoulders. Holding a camera steady is a challenge at times. This was the main selling point for me.I have used the camera for scenic shots, portraits, weddings and flowers with insects. The pictures are fantastic.Highly recommend.", "Date": "March 18, 2005"}, {"Title": "wonderful camera", "Author": "Lea R. Valentine \"Leavalfox\"", "ReviewID": "R2F3M37X5U5SQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is my favorite. The pictures have outstanding clarity, and the camera is easy to operate. It can practically take pictures on its own!! I use it alot for puppy pics, and I can't tell you how easily I can capture the pups in motion...there's not the normal lag time of a typical digital, so I can capture the moment as it really happened instead of the formerly seen blank view...or the view of a puppy's tail!! It's a Minolta...of course!!", "Date": "December 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2C0FGFH2LS746", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera a month ago. Beats my friend's two-year-old Nikon 5700. Most impressive is the manual control. Very easy to use despite the number of knobs. I was able to get 80% of the functions without reading the manual (no experience with Minolta digicams before). Satisfied with the quality though people have been complaining about the noise in Minolta cams for a long time. Would definitely recommend to anybody who wants a decent camera but doesn't want to spend big $ on a DSLR.", "Date": "June 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Product good, dealer lacking", "Author": "Susan Trulove", "ReviewID": "RW7O44Y8X570M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera has almost all the features I wanted, but I had reviewed it before I bought and have experience with Minolta Dimage. Even though it is old, it has the fastest auto focus of any camera I have used (including new, high-end Canon), and the best antishake.  Also, outstanding lens quality. However, it came from this dealer without even a lens cover. And it would have been nice to have a manual. I have found a lens cover but still looking for a manual.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Minolta Dimage A1", "Author": "Syed S.

Takes great pictures (250+) on a single charge.  Has many advanced features, so don't spend the money unless you are going to use all the nice features.

Lefcourte", "ReviewID": "R37O6NEBBUFFB0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this for several years, bought it when it first came out. I like it very much, it took the place of 35mm film SLRs that I'd used for years.It is complicated to take maximum advantage of it's potential but it takes great pictures on the auto setting.I really like the electric contacts that determine if your hand is grasping the camera. If not it shuts off so battery isn't drained.Two features that make me reduce its rating. It is very difficult to tell depth of field if you are using it's manual aperture and the photos are vignetted if you use a filter and I like to keep a polarizing filter on all lenses that can be fitted.Decent size, not too big. But I do borrow my wife's pocket Canon for ease of use and portability", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Stunning", "Author": "Adrian Rinehart-balfe", "ReviewID": "R1G2GIATHWZEMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish I had the words to describe how awesome this thing is.

But........", "Author": "Breaking Sunrise \"Rhiannon\"", "ReviewID": "RWDN7CQ1M71LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought  this camera and read the manual and loved all the feathers  It was awesome.I spent two days going over the book and taking shots and I remember when it first came on a warning  came on and after that I would take pictures of the DVD player Two Towers movie and they were awesome and all the pictures I took were awesome but then it started rolling when I pointed it at my tv screen and the LED got bright and dim and for no reason and there was nothing about this in troubleshooting in the users manual and then the battery went dead and so I recharged it and went to bed and in the morning after only a few pictures taken the battery went very low again and only after 4 or 5 pictures and I was so sad because I am not a pro by any means but I own a 3.2 nikon and it did not do any weird stuff and I have had it for almost 2 years and I loved that camera upgrade and I could have bought the nikonD100 or the top of the line cannon SLR and have all the lenses it would ever need/flashes too. But I loved this camera and all the features making it my perfect upgrade.I am not a pro by no means but I felt it must be defective when I charged it and went to bed and got up and took some more yet,only 4 or 5 and the battery was shot again????!!  I would buy that camera again because I loved it so much and I never owned a minolta but I loved everything about it . I took pictures only inside and at night and in the day and they were fantastic. But the rolling on the tv shots and the light and dimming on the LCD and then last but not least a battery going dead after charging it only after 4 or5 shots made me conclude it was defective. This was also in auto mode and I checked my other digital nikon and it did not do any of these things and as sad as I was to return it,There was no answers in the manual for these problems. If anyone reads this and has some kind of answer please speak out to me because I loved that camera and have missed it ever since the return also I if it was defective and does not eat batteries I would most definatly purchase it again. I do not no the difference between camera shake and built in stabilation but I would take the chance on re-ordering that camera again Since the problems I listed were nowhere in the manual whih I spent two full days on what else could I do but I still love it and would love to have one without the problems I have stated above. Lastly, Does this camera eat battery power that fast?? I love that camera and I have read them all so please let me know if that is a real problem. AS for the rolling pictures of the Two TOwers DVD it only happened on the minolta and my nikon was fine. If there is any help out there I want to buy this one again. GREAT CAMERA. Last what are the silver metal things on the front side of this camera for> I forgot I hope some one reads tis because I am with the possitive reviews I think this camera and all features ROCK! I loved it and I as I said looked at all the camera's on site and this is the one.
