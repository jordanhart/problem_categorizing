{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I liked it at first...", "Author": "apodtoo", "ReviewID": "R3F2G63EFR2IV9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to love this camera based on the other reviews, but it came up short for me. Because I do a lot of high-resolution scrapbooks and greeting cards featuring my kids, I needed a camera that could outshine the 8MP camera on my iPhone (and let's face it, the iPhone's zoom feature is a joke). 16MP was more than enough, and the pictures came out beautiful, but there's a fatal flaw on this camera I just can't ignore:It's useless for children. My toddlers move -fast-, and the shutter speed on this camera is absolutely appalling. By the time the camera is able to capture the shot, the moment is completely lost and gone, and that's 50% of the reason I wanted a new camera (the MP resolution being the other 50%). At least now I know when I go to buy a different camera to watch for this feature. I find it incredible that my phone captures photos more instantaneously than a Nikon.If all you take is still shots, this may be the camera for you. I was impressed with the photo quality, the make of the camera, the ease of use, and the controls. The zoom feature is great but again, much too slow to capture the nanosecond of time children are stationary. The 3\" LCD is also very good quality and the auto-focus works very well. The auto scene settings are really all you need to create great photos.All in all, this is a good, but not a great buy. I can't overlook the Achilles' heel of the ultra-slow shutter, but I would recommend this for someone who only needs still or landscape portraiture.UPDATE 4/5/12: after returning this camera (thanks Amazon), I purchased the Panasonic DMC25K. Although about $35.00 separates these cameras, I was more than satisfied with my new purchase. The Panasonic's shutter speed, controls, and scene modes are far superior for such a small price difference. If you're shopping around with a little flexibility in price, I can't recommend the Panasonic DMC25K enough over this Nikon.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy It!", "Author": "Ivan Volcof", "ReviewID": "R2EWMWI8U6O9WO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When buying electronics on the internet you never really know what you're getting; sure the details of the device sound impressive but are they really, and is it the best deal possible with the constant progress in technology?

I food blog, I submit random shots to the local news and I like to take quick snapshots on the go when I find a cool craft or when I see a location that I might want to go back to with clients and take some REAL photos.All my professional gear is Canon. I have Nikon cameras but I honestly prefer Canon because I like the color and sharpness I get with Canon and it just feels good in my hand.Brand preference is a personal thing some people like Nikon better and I am fine with that I am not here to argue the Canon v.s. Nikon attributes.What I like about this camera: It uses an SD card and if you will invest in a quality SD card that has some speed to it you will be happy because the faster the photos load to the card, the shorter time you will have to wait between shots.It uses 2 AA batteries and they are handy, cheap and I never have to worry about forgetting to charge the batteries, (remember I want something that is ALWAYS handy and ready).  This camera is very light even when the batteries are in, but it feels more substantial in my hand than the fujifilm or the sony or the samsung did, they feel \"pastic-y\".  I like the red color it is rich looking,  I like the 3 inch viewing screen, but I hate not having a viewfinder (that is just something I am used to and will have to learn to work with) . On the plus side I can wear glasses and still take great photos.  I like the one touch switch over to video, but admittedly I will probably never use the video feature.  The menu and shooting modes are easy to navigate, it is very simple to change from portrait to landscape to museum and back to auto. I never even took out the instructions and I was taking photos in less than 3 minutes after opening the box.  Hard to beat a 16 MP camera for $99. If you find a better one let me know I will take this one back and buy it.What I do NOT like about this camera: blurred and distorted photos when using the zoom. In order to get a good photo I have to zoom slowly and if I edit on screen before transferring to iPhoto, it seems to minimize the blurring.Indoor shots are a little disappointing unless you have time to snap, look at it to be sure, and re-take shots, in other words take several shots and try different modes I would say that 6 out of 10 indoor shots are usable.If you expect to take \"spontaneous\" snap shots quickly to catch first steps for example I am not entirely confident you will get them.  The lag time is a MAJOR dislike for me, by the time It focuses and flashes my subject has moved. I was able to edit most pictures and they looked fine on Facebook once posted. Could I blow these up to a 24X36 and hang it on my wall? probably not it would look blurred.Bottom line this camera performs as expected for a basic point and shoot.  I think most people who take pictures for fun, or to share with friends and family, or like me to have something acceptable for Facebook type images, you would be happy with it. If you are looking for WOW, AMAZING, PROFESSIONAL photos this is not the camera for you.  I think that Fuji Finepix T400 camera with the 16MP and he 40X Zoom would blow this one away, but it is $459 so I would expect it to be better than this one.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unacceptable problems right from the start", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Stef\"", "ReviewID": "RI1A2IJKCUVA0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera took fantastic photographs---when it felt like working.

What prompted me buy it was the fact my niece has the Nikon Coolpix L20 ( I think that's it anyway ) and it always took good pictures. I had also bought my wife and daughter the Nikon Coolpix L22 and neither one of them have complained one bit. They both went threw (combined) five cameras, from various manufactures (Olympus being one of them) and nothing came close to the quality and ease at which you can use these Nikon Coolpix series cameras. They are fantastic little cameras. I tested this one out when I first got it to make sure it worked alright and it's just as it should be. This model has a better optical zoom and bigger MegaPixal count than previous models and for the price it beats out a ton of the other cameras it's size. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one at all.The video is of real good quality also. Took the wife's camera to a concert last month and the quality of the video and sound were really good. I was surprised to say the least, as it was a rock concert and I figured the sound would be distorted. Nope, good picture and sound, and that was on the L22, so I can only imagine the L26 will even be better with it's better optical zoom.It uses two double A batteries. The whole family uses the Duracell Rechargeables, which saves you a bunch of money over time. The memory cards for the Coolpix series are getting pretty cheap also, so no worries about expensive cards.Have you wanted a digital camera or just wanted to upgrade what you have?

I say 'about' because I am sure I haven't even scratched the surface as to the capabilities of this camera.It was easy to set up as a simple point and shoot, so I was literally taking pictures in a few minutes.

It's strange to have a two-star experience with a product that averages nearly four-stars.The first few pictures we took were under-exposed, so we went to a different room with very different lighting. Often in perfectly adequate lighting the camera takes 3 to 5 seconds to take the picture. The subject of most of our pictures is our two-year-old daughter, so the moment is often lost after just one second. Even outdoor photos are under-exposed.After 20+ bad pictures, we reset the camera to factory settings in case some setting had been changed. We then set out on a mission to take a decent picture. We got one. We are returning for refund and going back to our old camera.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wife loves it.", "Author": "Chris Steffey", "ReviewID": "R35PKMW4PJA1T8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife on her birthday.

I have three dogs, and taking photos of them with this camera is an art form I've yet to master. Even catching a person smiling is difficult.

There are some things that I LIKE and things I DISLIKE on this camera:LIKES:1) Easy for anyone to point and shoot especially on AUTO. This is the easiest mode to use and one for beginners.2) Has manual mode settings such as: Outdoors, Incandescent, Florescent, Low Lighting and more!3) Can manually turn the flash on and off in both picture mode and video mode.4) Close up pictures come out very detailed and clear.5) Uses AA Batteries - I tried regular ones and they work but do not last long. Just tried the Lithium ones and they last for months!DISLIKES:1) The video format on the file is AVI versus the MPEG and AVI takes up lots of file space.2) Videos are OK, but not near as good as my video camera, in a pinch, they will do.3) Could not find the Anti Shake for still pictures. The reason that I need anti shake is I have a friend who takes group pictures with this camera and she has a slight shake and every picture she takes with this camera is a little blurry.However, when I take pictures of a group say dancing fast on the dance floor or even posing, it comes out clear as I am very very careful NOT TO SHAKE!4) The pictures are pretty clear, especially the outdoor ones and close up pictures...however, my Samsung Galaxy phone with an 8MP camera takes SUPERB shots and has the ANTI SHAKE on it.Suggestions: This camera would be very good to give someone as a first camera or even to treat yourself to a lower cost camera. However, I WOULD NOT SUGGEST this to you if you tend to shake when you take a picture as the picture may come out BLURRY.*** To make sure the pictures are not BLURRY - 1) Hold the camera steady and firmly. 2) Press slowly the shutter button. 3) DO NOT SHAKE or be in a hurry when taking pictures with this camera.This camera I will continue to use because of the AA battery feature and I do like the camera. Is it perfect? No, if you want a better camera, get one with ANTI SHAKE and pay about 50 dollars more!My true rating is 3.5 stars rounded off to 4.0 (to the nearest decimal).", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed!", "Author": "David A Smith", "ReviewID": "R11R1ZDXOE87CD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My parents bought this for me as a birthday gift, and after just a couple of months of low to moderate use, the lens cover stopped opening.

I love the look of the camera, and the ease of use.  It takes good photos, does well in low light conditions, and has an excellent macro function. However, it has the weakest battery door of any camera ever made.  To make things worse, the springs at the bottom of the battery compartment are intensely strong and put far too much pressure on the battery door.  Having read about the battery door issue prior to buying the camera, I took a small allen wrench and placed the short end underneath each battery spring, pushed a Sharpie down into the compartment and pressed on each spring until I felt them \"give\" a bit.  It relieved quite a lot of pressure when trying to close the door.  Sadly, 6 weeks ago I dropped the camera (it was in a padded bag) and the battery door latch broke.  Nikon will not cover this under warranty, so like many other owners of the L24 I now have a small piece of tape holding the door closed.  I would recommend this camera except for this one problem.
