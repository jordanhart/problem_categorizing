{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good budget camera (polaroid i1237)", "Author": "Low-Ranking Reviewer \"tell it like it is\"", "ReviewID": "R2VWAAKUWS3D5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a camera expert, nor do i care to be one.  I just needed a 'better than my cell camera' but not a 'high-cost professional grade camera' for certain occasions.  Something in between, and this was a very good buy to fit that need imo.  Having said that, i found it on clearance/repackaged at a certain retailer so evidently someone else didnt like it and returned it.  This model(i1237) retails around 70-80?  I bought it clr/rep for less than 60.  Again, i'm no camera-phile.  So take these impressions with a grain of salt:what i like:* 12 megapixels, 2.7\" lcd screen, 3x optical/5x digital, face-tracking, anti-shake, smile detection, 28 scene modes, etc.  compare those stats to other cameras and you will see much higher prices, or similar prices for this camera, but for less megapixels.  the pics looks sharp/detailed.* takes video clips with audio* has more features/options/cutomizations than i would ever care to use or know how to operate.  there's a quick-start manual, and a cd-rom instructional.  haven't touched the cd-rom.  read the quick-start manual and got the hang of the camera well enough.* sd/sdhc compatible cards for more storage.  you will need it with the paltry 32mb of built-in storage.* fun and easy-to-use.  more complicated if you choose to use all its features, but it's good that they're there whether you use them or not.* comes with 2 aa batteries, usb cable, manual, cd-rom, wrist strap.what i don't like:* minor, but it's kinda bulky.  it's almost twice the size(width) of my friends camera with the exact same stats.  a bit heavy, but good quality build.  it's just kinda bulky.* i thought it was a unique, violet, neon-looking color at the store.  nope, its just pink.  remember, i bought a repackaged/clearance version so it was the only one at that price, so cheapskates-can't-be-choosers.  (but i must like this camera if i'm going to stick with the color)* there's a slight delay when taking a pic.  the time it takes you to say \"cheeese\" is the time it takes to press the button and then have it actually take the pic.  this camera isn't for people who are 'spontaneous pic takers'.  but when you're on vacation and plan on taking pics of scenery that isn't going anywhere, it's not too bad.what i haven't figured out yet:* burst mode.  amazon review says the i1237 has this burst-mode feature(take quick pics in succession).  nice feature.  can't wait to find where it is on my camera and use it.* AV outs.  as in hooking the camera up to my big screen and enjoy pics there via AV cables?  sounds great.  but i only see battery/sd card/usb cable slots.(guess i will have to look at that cd-rom software instructional for these two features)Anyway, the other review for this camera says there is a dotted line running through the screen.  Maybe we have slightly different models but mine does not have this feature.  The pics look fine in the screen and on my computer when i transferred them.  So basically, if you want a good 12 megapixel camera and see this on sale(in a color you actually want), i'd recommend it.(note: i input i1237 at amazon and it took me to the cia-1237, which looks exactly like my camera, including the bulky look and unfortunate pink color.  the amazon review also shows the i1237 number so i'm guessing my review is in the right place)[update: 8/5/'10.  after fairly extensive use on a recent vacation my impressions on this camera is even more favorable.  that burst mode i couldn't find is under 'sport mode'.  the slight delay in the pic taking is under 'auto' mode mostly(numerous other pic-taking modes have virtually no delay).  and my favorite feature is the 'pic capture option' in the video playback(switching from camera to video mode can be a hassle, so i just take short videos and play them back and when i see a good photo-op i just capture that moment as a pic).  great camera.  still wondering about the av outs, and it's still too pink and bulky.  4 1/2 stars][update: 1/9/'12.  still working, still using, still enjoying despite other options.  seriously, taking short/long videos, then previewing them on screen, and pausing it during playback and using screen-capture mode to save a pic from that video...fun and convenient.  i like this camera anyway]", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A 6 month retrospective.", "Author": "D. C. Fletcher", "ReviewID": "R251EGJIEDVV4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up at Target for $65 on special last summer. I've owned a Panasonic TZ3 and Canon PowerShot SD950 IS, both were considered excellent cameras in their day and age and were both around $300. This camera is better than both hands down, its also better than my friends $200 Nikon and father's $150 Olympus which are the same vintage as this Polaroid.More responsive screen, better sensor, excellent flexibility in PASM mode and solid build quality. The only thing that could be improved is the lense which is okay for this price bracket but so-so even among point and clicks, however the thing zooms very quickly. Also with a class 10 SD card reviewing is instantaneous. The Sony sourced sensor is the real gem of this camera; what really makes it stand out as a sub $100 camera is the ISO and low light performance. Only problem with this camera is you need to be adapt at getting the most with PASM, thats what allows it to rise above the other under $100 junk cameras. Its auto modes are worthless though.My main shooting camera is a Sony alpha-Nex 3 that camera is also a PASM mode gem and I do not feel embarrassed sometimes using this polariod. Considering how dirt cheap their cameras are (likely from people avoiding them) I will prob pick up their 14MP 5x zoom when that gets dirt cheap too. If you use cameras like I do; you learn exactly what settings are called for in any given situation quickly. With that this camera has served me better than any other point and click I've owned.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Problems That Can't Be Solved", "Author": "S. E.

Every picture I've tried to take outdoors is white. I've adjusted everything in the menu, and nothing helps.

I got one for my Grand Daughter and one for my Daughter a while back. Both ended up screwing up like other reports that can be found in the search engines. Like a fool, I threw away the papers to have a warrenty, so I lost. Like a bigger fool, I ordered another one from Amazon, only three weeks ago, and guess what. It went blank too. All three of these were handled carefully and sustained no abuse. The reviews we read all show the same problems. Only a short life and if you contact Polaroid, you get, \"Gee I'm Sorry\" Don't end up like us. Save your money for a different brand.

Coggin \"Clean Life\"", "ReviewID": "RTME3TLV7CFCZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have purchased a few small cameras over the years, both cost a lot more, but now I know why.  First, the pink was more of a red color, not good when you hate the color red. More importantly, the camera takes too long to take the picture after you press the button...nothing stays still that long without using a tripod. Then, there is a dotted line that runs through the center of the screen and stays there when you review your photos in the camera-so without checking to see if it carries over to the actual computer transferred photo, I am done with this camera.
