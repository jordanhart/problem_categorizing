As the owner of a panasonic lumix fz35, I was very excited to see this small and compact camera, since my other lumix is bulky. When i saw the price for this camera, a 14mp, 8X I knew i had to have it. I took it to my trip with a fully charged battery and the battery sustained up to 14 hours of continuous photo sessions in different places around the park, it never died on us. The pictures are great, they do have a drop of noise in low-light situations but that is to be expected. The image stabilization does an amazing job with pictures taken in the dark without flash, which actually surprised me. We took some really awesome pictures with this camera. It weighs close to nothing and it fits right in my pocket, best purchase I made for the trip. I do have to say I am not particularly impressed with the video quality, except for the HD. The HD is pretty cool, but you need an sd card with massive storage to get a good recording time because it takes up a lot of space. I bought an 8gb sd card which held about 1200 pictures at 14mpx, but i took my pics at 10 mp since i don't think i will be printing this pics at a large size. Overall i think this camera is amazing, it also has a pretty awesome touchscreen lcd which is big enough for you to know what you're doing. I love this camera!!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera.", "Author": "Chenango \"Chenango\"", "ReviewID": "R12T0DV223RXHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The optical zoom is great.  The Intelligent auto setting is great.  The ease of use is great.  The pictures are great.  Note the digital zoom is great too...but you have to be in normal picture mode to get the full zoom....but with 8x optical zoom, you'd probably only want the digital zoom in special situations.  The touchscreen is easy to use and works great.I haven't dropped the camera, so I can't comment on how it does when dropped or submitted for service (as another reviewer has).  It has a nice sturdy feel so I don't think I'll have this issue (knock on wood).", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cheaper than FH20, So i'll endure the touchscreen.", "Author": "Gold Fish Lung", "ReviewID": "R1KXAPA31RV0SD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's really not that bad, the touchscreen is quite useful for quick adjustments in settings.  Where it gets bothersome is when  you're trying to pan around a picture while zoomed in.  It's so annoying that you'll just forgo panning around.Pros:-Great price for camera with lots of features.-Great picture quality for Point and Shoot-Fast start up.-FAST autofocus, very fast-Good battery life (300 pics)-Up to 1600 iso (better than not having it)-Pretty decent 720p video at 30fps-Touchscreen actually very intuitive for changing settings-Auto white balance is good in most light conditions, indoor lighting sometimes throws it off but not that big of a deal, that's what Lightroom is for.Cons:-A bit on the beefy side, but still very pocket-able.-Overall construction seems okay, but doesn't give the me confidence it would survive a fall.-Takes awhile if you want to pan around a zoomed in photo-Firmware update to 1.2 doesn't seem to make a noticeable difference in touchscreen responsiveness.Final Thoughts:If you have the option of buying the FH20 at less than or equal to the price of Fh22, then GET IT. Otherwise, this is probably one of the better cameras at this price point as far as picture quality goes.  I have a Casio that has taken a beating for years and still going strong, hopefully this Panasonic will be the same way.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "good small camera", "Author": "jsc", "ReviewID": "R21Q3ZHTDKNBLZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had it a few months with no probs, there is a firmware update that made the touchscreen slightly more responsive and it did seem to help. It's really small and feels solid. There are newer/better models now anyway, looks like they replaced it with DMC-FH2.

It is a good value with a solid performance.  Does not have all the bells and whistles that some competitors have, but this camera will last more than six months.  Lens, made by Leica is one of the better on the market. How many cameras offer a Leica lens at this price?  Camera construction is rugged and durable.  LCD screen could be larger but the one offered is adequate.  Battery life good..expect about 100 photos per charge.  You can also charge the battery and leave the camera idle for two months with the charge almost full.  One draw back is the touch screen control features.  Screen react is slow and you may have to tap your command option twice to get the camera to respond.

Choose FH20", "Author": "Ricardo Miller \"Maximus\"", "ReviewID": "R105OHSVYPDU8B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After reading reviews of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20 I decided to get it. I also noticed that this, the FH22 model, was the same camera but upgraded with a touchscreen (and bigger price tag). I was not interested in the touchscreen but when I went to BestBuy to get the FH20 and it was sold out I was faced with the last FH22 in stock and so I went for gold. It was a Christmas gift being bought the day after Christmas and so time was of the essence. This was a bad idea because I was only visiting the USA and returning it is almost impossible now that I am back home in Jamaica.So I was expecting the touchscreen to work like a modern touchscreen on a phone or ipod or something like that. WRONG! The touchscreen is HORRIBLE! First I was hoping the images would have auto-rotated based on how I held the camera...no such luck but that's ok. Here is where the problem lies. Scrolling is horrible! It is so unresponsive you really feel retarded. In review mode there are 2 arrows that appear over the image, a left arrow and a right arrow and you have to tap on the arrow for it to scroll. The fastest you can scroll is about 1 image per second, if you are lucky. That may sound fast but it is NOT!! You can also drag your finger across the screen and the image goes to the next or previous one depending on the direction you dragged your finger. Sounds good? WRONG again! this is even slower than trying to tap on the tiny arrows, and this method works about half the time. You find yourself dragging your finger across the screen 3 or 4 times before the image moves.If scrolling was say..3 out of 10, then panning on a zoomed image would be -3 out of 10 (yes that is negative 3). Once zoomed in you see 4 arrows appear on the screen...up, down, left and right. These arrows are even smaller than the normal scrolling ones and so you attempt to press it 5 or more times before it works. Then when it does, the image moves in such a small increment it will easily take an entire minute to pan from the left of the screen to the right. HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!!Why did I give it 3 stars? Well it takes damn good pictures and the intelligent auto is just AWESOME! Plus i am training myself to get used to the touchscreen and use different methods to scroll through the pictures such as going to multi-view and scrolling through many images at a time. If i want to scroll one image at a time I use the excellent slide show option and let it scroll automatically.Now after looking back at it I'm going to take off another star and give it only 2. The poor touchscreen is really over-shadowing the good. It is that BAD! Do not go thinking you are gonna get a camera with ipod-like touchscreen qualities.Would I recommend this to you or anyone else? NO! Get the FH20 that has no touchscreen. If all the features are the same as this one without the touchscreen as they say, then i would easily give it 5 out of 5 stars.10 February 2011 UPDATE: Soooo, after  weeks of use the camera is dead! While taking pictures at a party it simply stopped working and the lens refuse to retract completely. An error message appears on the screen saying \"zoom error\" or something like that. It seems the lens or something got detached. This is really sad... but I'm a little relieved for the touchscreen was really tempting me to throw this camera in the wall. A fitting death to a horrible camera!", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stick with an actual camera manufacturer", "Author": "DB", "ReviewID": "R34E72CPM3PQ4B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera isnt very good, it takes lousy, grainy pictures. It tells you the SD card is full even when it has 13 MB of free space. Picture file sizes are huge: 5 + MB for pictures that are not even clear. Panasonic support is worthless, the rep told me to just have it repaired (this was on the first day I owned it!) The rep also told me she was sure my SD card was full even though I had told her twice I had removed all the pictures from it, formatted it in the camera and tried again. Its too bad too because the camera has a lot of great features and its relatively easy to use. Seems well made, well constructed and tough.THis is a 14 megapixel camera that I bought to replace a Kodak 3.2 megapixel camera that's almost 10 years old and guess what - the old Kodak takes MUCH better pictures with much more clarity and definition. I tried various settings and lighting conditions, nothing helped.  I used it to take pictures of my grandson in his Christmas play and it ruined them, they are blurry, out of focus and pretty much worthless and the event can't be done over obviously. Other people there took pictures with similar class \"point and shoot\" cameras and they came out great.  Find another camera, stick with camera brand name.

The excellent optical zoom in particular is a great feature.  The large touchscreen makes for beautiful image previews, but is a little less responsive than a typical button-based interface when zooming/panning/inspecting pictures in camera memory.  For this reason, if you're choosing between a FH22 and FH20 and really like reviewing your pictures right after you've taken them, I'd suggest the FH20 (same exact camera but no touchscreen).However, I'm not sure I can really recommend either of those cameras, or even Panasonic as a company from which to buy a digital camera.I recently dropped my FH22 from a height of 3 feet onto a tile floor, which caused the CCD (image sensor) to stop working.  I suspect that the CCD somehow got loose inside the camera from the fall, as everything about the camera works except for the fact that it appears to be taking a picture of pitch black no matter where I point it.  While it may have just been one unlucky bounce (always take anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt), I've owned a few point-and-shoots before this FH22 and was truly surprised that such a trivial fall could harm the camera in that way.  It's possible that Panasonic just doesn't make cameras as reliable or durable as previous brands I've owned (Canon and Kodak, dropped many, many times).Even if this malfunction was just an isolated freak accident, one thing that's for sure broken is Panasonic's service/repair procedure.  I sent my camera in to an official Panasonic repair center and was quoted a price of $60 over the phone.  A week later, I received an invoice for $128.25.  Seeing as how I bought the camera brand new for $200 (you may be able to get it even cheaper by now), that price seemed a little steep.  I called Panasonic up again and they explained that they don't repair cameras, they only ever replace them with refurbished models.  They claimed they weren't sure what the earlier $60 quote was about.Other minor service gripes:1. When asking about the $128.25, tried calling the specific Panasonic service center I sent my camera to (using a phone number that they supplied me) 3 times a day for an entire week, and never got through.  Eventually had to call up Panasonic's main number in order to hear the bad news.2. My invoice actually had $61.98 originally printed on it.  Somebody used whiteout and a blue pen to write in $128.25 (you can see through the whiteout with minimal effort).  Shady shady.So in conclusion, while I take full responsibility for dropping my camera I simply cannot recommend Panasonic cameras as a brand to buy.tl;dr: When it works, it's great.
