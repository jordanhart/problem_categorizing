The size is great, and the LCD screen is very large and clear for the size of the camera. It takes great pictures and is very easy to use. I've found that the battery lasts a really long time, and charges quickly. It takes videos which are of good quality also. I would recommend this camera to anyone. I can't even think of anything negative to say about it!", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fabulous camera!", "Author": "D.

Turned on red eye reduction and everything was ok. After about 1 1/2 years with this camera, I found that the pictures started to have stripes running through them. In order to stop this from happening, I would have to turn off the camera and turn it back on and the pictures would be ok. Fully charged or now, this would happen after a few pictures were taken.Most recently, at year 2, I took pictures on vacation all week. Came home and the camera said card read error. All of the pictures were gone. Both the camera and the memory card were Fuji. Still working to recover the pictures and determine the problem. Will not buy a fuji product again.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Swap Meets and Flea Markets", "Author": "Uglyhorse", "ReviewID": "R3AAMOEW6V1XWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You know that joyous feeling when you find a super deal at the swap meet? I hit the jackpot with this camera. It was used, and from a small vendor. It was something like $12 and it came FAST with all the cables and a working battery. Takes fine pictures, hi-res, far better than any cell phone camera I've seen. It has zoom, flash/lighting, orientation features cell phones rarely offer. Now it will not send your beach pictures to your Facebook page, but I agree with Betty White - Faceook sucks up time like nothing else on Earth. And if I took my recent beach pictures from Half Moon Bay with a cell phone camera, I'd likely spend more time fiddling with the d*** GPS and messaging than enjoying the scenery. And a cell phone... well you run the distinct risk of getting a \"have to take this\" call from your boss, wife, mistress, creditor, homey... AND they all all know you are at the beach BECAUSE your d*** cell phone posted the pics to Facebook. Busted... fired... divorced... no, a dedicated camera still has a place.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "do yourself a favor, don't buy this camera!", "Author": "Ana Evans", "ReviewID": "R1WZY92MG7ARGC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I owned a Canon A60 for a number of years, which I loved.  However last year I decided that I would like to upgrade to a sleeker, lighter camera with a larger screen, and more megapixels and decided on the F460.  What a mistake!  Although this camera has all of these attributes, it takes terrible pictures.  Unless I am in the absolute brightest light my pictures are consistently out of focus...  which completely negates the point of having a higher resolution camera.  If you are shopping for a digital camera, get something that has the software to compensate for vibrations or movements while you are taking a picture.  Otherwise everything will be out of focus (I guess unless you cart around a tri-pod, which also defeats the purpose of buying a light-weight camera.Less than a year after purchasing this camera I am shopping for a new digital camera.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Fuji Finepix F460 5.1mp\n3X Optical Digital Camera", "Name": "Fuji Finepix F460 5.1mp Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41USHMXTktL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000CEU446"}}
