{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a great buy", "Author": "Just Gary", "ReviewID": "R5C4WBX6MSKA3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE ON Aug 11, 2013: I have had these working for two years. I ended up buying four of them. I posted a picture of one working. One of them had an issue because it was too close to the dryer and would go off unexpectantly when I was drying clothes. For some reason moisture does affect a few, but not all, of these cameras. I ended up swapping it for one of the other detectors and had no issues with either when I did that. Other than that, they are working great with no issues. I have caught two contractors and a \"friend\" looking through drawers in my house. The \"friend\" actually took money out of my wallet while I was in another room. He isn't invited back any more but I never told him about the camera.The picture is great. The sound is so clear that my cat heard his own voice recording and went to the PC speakers to investigate. No one ever thinks that the smoke detectors are recording. Even the installers just thought it was a new type of central alarm system; you have to run the lines through the attic to a central location and I wasn't going to crawl up there in 100 degree weather. Well worth it.Remember that this is just a surveillance camera and you have to buy the DVR and connecting wires separately. Some people rated this bad because they thought it was a complete system, which it never claims to be.To answer some of the questions I have seen on here:1. This is a surveillance camera. It does not record. It does not have memory. It doesn't come with instructions because it is to be used with a surveillance system. It does not have an independent removeable battery. It needs a power source and needs to be connected to a system that is typically used for surveillance, like a 4-channel DVR. Power is usually supplied with those systems. This is basically an add-on.2. If it doesn't look like the picture shown on this page, return it. You got the wrong product.3. This gives a real crisp and clear picture when it gets plenty of light. It works in diim light but not in the dark. The less light, the less clarity.4. Finally, this does work as a smoke detector and no one looks at the smoke detectors. I have no idea why people think it is obvious as I bet you cannot describe your smoke detector. It has a hole (of course) but shows no sign of a camera. Only if you absolutely have seen one of these before would you know it is a surveillance camera.5. It takes some electronic know-how to hook up a security system so if you know nothing about electronics, seek professional help.ORIGINAL POST: I had bought another brand that was cheaper and I was unhappy. The other one was priced under $50 but did not have audio, was black and white, and was not a functioning smoke detector. If you looked at it, you can even spot the camera as it is not totally concealed.So, I decided to purchase this one because of the pic (yes I know that can be dangerous). Well, it looks exactly like the pic. The actually picture quality is really good and in color. The audio works perfectly. And it is a functioning fire alarm. There is no way anyone can tell it is a camera device.The only problem I had was that I gave it a little power to test the video, which activated it. So, when I take the power away, it beeps like it has a low battery. Very annoying when you are setting it up.I am buying a second one.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than expected.", "Author": "John D. Grissom \"Cain\"", "ReviewID": "R2V38QGR72IEID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I install business/home security cameras and I admit I was worried when I first saw the tiny pinhole. Most 1/3\" lens Sony cameras I install have a much larger lens. I thought there is NO way this is going to give the area of view my customer was looking for. I plugged the thing up to our \"in house\" DVR and wow was I surprised!! I held it high above my head as close to the ceiling as I could get and after seeing the viewing area, color quality and brightness, I could not wait to get it installed.We installed this in the customer\u2019s house and after getting everything plugged in I was AGAIN amazed. Not only did it cover everything they wanted to see, the AUDIO reception (which I did not test before) was OUTSTANDING. We could hear their small dog drinking from its water dish from across the room as well as watch him doing it. ALSO, it really is a smoke alarm. It has a rechargeable battery that is recharged from the power supply. This is NOT a night vision camera. There has to be some light in the room. We installed two of these in the customer\u2019s house; one in the kitchen where lighting was outstanding, this resulted in OUTSTANDING color and clarity. The second was in the living room where the lighting was dim (table lamp and television) and on a scale of 1 - 10 I would still give it a 5 or 6 simply because even though it has no infrared emitters it still produced a picture good enough you could tell what was going on in the room even in the dark corners.** NOTE ** This is a camera/smoke alarm that MUST be plugged in to a 12v power supply (not included) and either a DVR or something with video INPUTS. You will need to cut a nickel/quarter size hole in your ceiling to run the (not included) cables to a power supply and your video source.Pros:1.) Tiny pinhole that if you did not know it was there you would NEVER notice it.2.) 1/3\" SONY CCD Wide Angle Color lens which in my opinion for the size and money you can't beat.3.) REAL WORKING smoke alarm!!! The smoke detector has a rechargeable battery and really detects smoke! There is even a test button on it that when depressed emits a loud alarmCons:1.) This is in NO WAY a complaint. I'm just mentioning it so you know. NOT A NIGHT VISION CAMERA. For it to be \"Night Vision\" it would have to have infrared LED's and then (to some people) it would be obvious that it's a hidden camera. You defeat the purpose of \"hidden camera\" then. This camera needs a least a small lamp in the room to see.** NOTE ** This is a camera/smoke alarm that MUST be plugged in to a 12v power supply (not included) and either a DVR or something with video INPUTS.

Moore \"BMoore\"", "ReviewID": "R4IPTEOH0904F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have a dozen or so cameras (all exterior) located around the house and property, but due to how the front porch and door is recessed, it would have been nearly impossible to mount a dome or bullet camera to cover the front entrance without it sticking out like a sore thumb. I decided to mount an indoor camera to cover the front door and I installed this camera approximately 2 months ago. I wanted to try a concealed/covert style to avoid mounting an obvious dome or bullet, but must admit I fully expected the quality to be crappy because of the low price. I was wrong. This little camera not only blends in perfectly on the ceiling, the resolution is indistinguishable from 750 tvl cameras mounted outside. This camera does require more light to operate than our outdoor domes and bullets (when they are in color mode), but I don't need it to, nor would I really expect it to. I am extremely impressed with the quality of this camera and am amazed at the price. I strongly recommend this camera to anyone who needs an interior day only camera, but doesn't want to install an obvious camera. I should probably point out that I did not hook up the microphone, since I only needed the camera. Therefore I can't comment on how the audio works, but have no reason to think it wouldn't impress me just as the video has.Amended review on 9-2-2012:I have just installed a second one of these cameras in the office and experienced the same results. Once again, I'm very pleased.

I have only been able to get the camera to function.  I have NOT been able to successfully test the smoke alarm function.  After completely installing this product in my ceiling I have been able to successfully initiate the camera function.  Unfortunately the \"SMOKE ALARM\" feature is DOA.  Dead on arrival.  The red light illuminates and blinks as if it is functioning.  The button right next to the instructions to \"test weekly\" does not perform any function at all.  I pushed the button.  I pushed and held down the button.  I repeatedly pushed and then held the button.  Nothing happens.  The red light continues to blink.The next test that I performed was with burning matches.  The smoke and suit from the matches was not efficient to set off the smoke alarm either.  I tried multiple matches as well as burning paper.  Nothing worked.The smoke alarm is DOA.Unfortunately I had ordered a second one before I realized that the first one was crap.  When the second one arrives I will test it as well.Oh.  As a bonus to my negative review this device is a \"hard wired device\" only yet it doesn't come with a power cord or an A/C adaptor.
