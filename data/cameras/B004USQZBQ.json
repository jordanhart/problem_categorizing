{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK, not great", "Author": "Magnum", "ReviewID": "R16KVPI5X9F611", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for vacation this year because I was tired of lugging around the large SLR digitals I normally use. My 2001 Olympus, 4 MP camera takes much better photographs than this one. In fairness it did cost 9 times more than this one. But there has been 11 years of technology improvements in digital cameras since then. This is a 16.5 MP HD and was not impressed by the photos. The camera was slow and between frames seemed like an eternity so you can miss a lot. You have to be dead steady or your photos will be blurred. But the battery life is good. I bought two extra batteries and a separate 115/12 volt charger just in case. As it turns out, I really didn\u2019t need the extra batteries to get through a day. My wife and I both take a lot of photos and she changed batteries 2 times to my none in a day. Has an ok zoom for the size, but I am use to and prefer my SLR frame cameras. This camera is easy to use and easy to carry, fits in your coat or shirt pocket easily. It also did a good job with video. But the stills were not as good as they should have been for this camera. The price is great and for the price, this is an ok pocket camera.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$166.98", "Features": "Olympus sz-20 Digital Camera", "Name": "Olympus SZ-20 Full HD Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41I4U7UqGnL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004USQZBQ"}}
