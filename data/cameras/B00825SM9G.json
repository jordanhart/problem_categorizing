Poor quality picture, especially in low light (it might as well not have a flash)2. Takes way to long to focus or whatever it does (moment is over by the time the camera is ready)3. Screen scrached (not cracked) within the first couple of days and since its touchscreen its very hard to scroll through the gallery.I like the TL205 way better. There only reason my I bought this camera was because my TL205 screen went black (after reading reviews that seems to be common) and I thought this camera would be an upgrade. I was wrong. I was better off just buying another TL205.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "juan carlos", "ReviewID": "RERJDNUHU48T9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "so far had a good performance and has a high quality item in resoluccion....it arrived with everything described...only is the touch screen sometimes does not recognize the touch of my fingers", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera Christmas gift", "Author": "O'Henry \"brandy\"", "ReviewID": "RW7U69P3TT55H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a Christmas Gift my daughter she loves the great quality of the photos..
