{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kids Camera", "Author": "KR", "ReviewID": "R2EI0O8BEDMH06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for our daughter (3 years old) all the kids cameras on the market had below 2MP and cost between $60-$80 so we thought even if she broke this we could buy 3 for what the other's cost. We love the fact that she can flip the camera and take pictures of herself and since it's only 5MP with a 512SD card she can take over 500 pictures, hours of fun! It works great, but if anything changes I'll be sure to add a new/revise review.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS!", "Author": "Mkit", "ReviewID": "R7609C8KIZ54T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just received mine about half an hour ago. I put in fresh batteries and it never turned on. I opened it up to discover the leads to the battery were not even connected! Then when I reconnected them, the camera turned on and the screen was white indicating bad cables! Never buy this unless you feel like throwing away 30 bucks. Might consider parting it out and building something from the pieces but not to be used as a camera ever again.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth it even if it were free", "Author": "dockengal", "ReviewID": "R1PJIXMCSM5MCF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "That is what my 12-year-old daughter said: not worth it even if it were free. It's packaged in hard plastic, so you don't know until you open it. But you immediately feel how cheap it is - like cheap light plastic. The view screen is tiny and the picture quality poor.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two things....", "Author": "Ginger85", "ReviewID": "R2H4FZI8MMPYE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok number one! First and foremost! This camera is not great quality, it's built fine and all but the picture quality is severly lacking. HOWEVER! I posted a review after receiving the camera that I was severly upset about this camera and that it was a waste of my money, not 24 hours later I was contacted by the seller, computer geeks I believe is the name and they are AWESOME!! They said they were very sorry that the camera was poor quality and IMMEDIATELY issued a refund. No questions asked! They are great and I would be happy to buy from them again any time, the camera is ehh.....", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did not work", "Author": "Sierra", "ReviewID": "R1UX48GJHNV3ZF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I bought this camera just to use at work because I don't want my good camera getting dog hair all over it and it didn't work at all, and the camera was not even used.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$32.00", "Features": "Sakar Swivel Shot 5.1 MP 8x Digital Zoom Camera General Features: Color: Blue 5.1 MP Resolution\n8x Digital Zoom 180 Rotating Lens 1.5-inch TFT Preview Screen\nCan add up to five (5) morphing effects Secure Digital Card (SD) slot (card not included)\nSupports up to 8 GB SD/SDHC card Maximum Resolution: 2592 x 1944 Can shoot video Anti-shake\nSelf-timer: 2 seconds/10 seconds", "Name": "Sakar Swivel Shot 5.1MP 8x Digital Zoom HD Camera w/180\u00b0 Rotating Lens (Blue) -Record Yourself & Enjoy One Touch Sharing", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BHhjnrVsL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004AAN8UK"}}
