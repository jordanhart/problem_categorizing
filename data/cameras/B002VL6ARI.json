{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good at first but died after 6 months", "Author": "T. Fontz \"Sunday school Director\"", "ReviewID": "R3VGGZJY9IOIBU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas.  She loved it and it was a great first camera.  The batteries drained very fast and it didn't come with rechargable ones, only alkaline AA.  It's been 6 months and it won't even turn on anymore.  I found out that Kodak only offers a 90 day warranty and they want to charge me $45 plus shipping and handling to fix it.  I only paid $60.00 for it on Black Friday, so it makes more sense to buy a  new camera instead.  Maybe that's Kodak's idea too.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Digital Camera for Dummies should be the proper name but power issue", "Author": "New York Bargain Hunter", "ReviewID": "R2QWINPL9GV6B2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is simple, affordable, and does everything a beginner needs in a digital camera.  I have never seen a more user friendly camera than this one.  It is ridiculously user friendly.  On the screen there is actual text explaining to the user what this function is, what it is used for and how the picture should be taken.  Most cameras have little things for example like a head for portraits and a flower for macro, one has to read through a huge manual and memorize it to fully utilize any digital camera these days but not with this one.  Here is a good example:  A knowledgeable user knows that a star with a head means night portrait but my mom won't, so what does it say when I put on the star with the head?  \"Use at night to capture both subject and background. Steady camera for best results\" Text right on the screen explaining what it is.  Every single function has these texts.  It is perfect for people like my mother who knows absolutely zilch about digital cameras.  This camera holds you by the hand and shows you the ropes.  I bought this package super cheap, about half the suggested retail price, just look around you will find it.  The perfect Mother's day gift and the ultimate Digital Camera for Dummies.  It comes with a 2 gig sd card and decent case.  All you really need is 4 AA rechargeable batteries and a charger, since it takes 2 AAs, you should have an extra set handy when the batteries drain.  I recommend the eneloops, my choice.  But there seems to be a power issue with it now.  If the batteries are under 50%, it takes a while for the camera to turn on, call it a warm up but to me, it is unacceptable for a handheld camera to have this issue.  I will be returning it today.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare CD80 10.2 mp digital camera review", "Author": "Modmom2889", "ReviewID": "R3BNOP1FGI3A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Today I received my Kodak Easyshare CD80 Camera in the mail. It arrived in mint condition with all it's accessories as promised by the seller. I was able to put the batteries in and start shooting right away. The pictures turned out great, but if you don't have the flash on in a low light setting your pics come out very dark. The video quality was also great and I like the overall design of the camera. It is small enough for travel, and easy to work. I got this camera for my upcoming baby shower and our new baby boy, which will be here for valentines day. I think this camera will capture some great memories for us.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I have ever owned", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R2DBIWK34E4JC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to the combination of convenience and quality, this is the best camera I have ever owned.
