I ordered this pair of cables, along with another set from Defender and this cable is much more sturdy feeling! Compared to the defender cables these feel more like cable for your TV.  I would recommend these to anyone looking! The cable actually states it's 56 FT in length.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed...", "Author": "D. Wasinger", "ReviewID": "RKFVWSIDHUEZ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased thru Digital Peripheral Solutions. Returned because of a bad video bnc connector. The replacement cable I received should have been a new replacement but appeared to be used. There were scuff marks on the connectors and the packaging was shabby. The video connectors are ok but not the quality of the 100 ft cables from Q-See. I will just eat this one because another shipping charge to send it back means I would have paid twice as much for the cable.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great shielded RG-59 coax 18/2 siamese cables.", "Author": "David Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3K9IR52X20XU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Theses are shielded RG-59 coax with 2C #18 power cable.

Powell", "ReviewID": "R1FGZ5UN1YIMIW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Actually, I LIKE THE PRODUCT THAT IS SHOWN (I purchased some about a year ago), but it is NOT WHAT I RECEIVED. What I received was BLACK RG59 cable - and it did not appear to be shielded - which is what I needed for in-wall installation. Amazon shipped another package right away as a replacement - but it was exactly the same as the first.  I decided to try it anyway. It worked when I hooked it up to test it. But when I installed it in the wall going to the attic, the cable would not work.I believe the fault may have been that the manufacturer (Q-See) mislabeled the product they shipped to Amazon.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ordered this wire, recieved a black, Unshielded wire twice", "Author": "Bill Jaffe", "ReviewID": "R3KEZ2K9TP5OIQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The box says White/Shielded and the sticker on the actual wire says Color: WHITE.......yet the wire is black and is unshielded.
