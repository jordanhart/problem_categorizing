I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprised", "Author": "Kent", "ReviewID": "R1WQHALQAO06VJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very surprised that this camera actually performs fairly well.  While there are limited options for manual functionality, it does what it needs to do taking photos.  For the casual photographer, does everything you want it to do.  It can also be a good companion to a DSLR as well.The camera's option to support SD & Memory Stick is a great option.  No longer do you have to be tied to proprietary Sony MS.  This is definitely a step forward.On with the camera itself, I found that it does not fair well with the flip the lid and take the shot movement.  It takes time to startup and focus.  This camera takes quite a bit of time to focus on an image.The preset functions built in are very useful.  Different useful modes do tailor to many daily activities.  The iSweep, is great for a quick panoramic shot.  The superior auto mode along with other preset modes takes several shots and merges them on the camera to produce a better image.The movie mode is pretty good on the camera.  While not as functional as a true video capturing device, this camera does the job at high quality.  The ability to take stills, zoom, while recording is a cool feature.  I dislike the fact that the camera needs to be in standby mode for  a few seconds before recording can begin.The 3D function is probably gimic'y and requires a 3D tv to view the content.  Thus it was useless.The waterproof feature has yet to be tested.  The shockproof wasn't so bad, the camera was dropped, got nicked but still functions properly.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME CAMERA!!!

Only because the store was closing...I paid $10 for the extra battery and $18 for the charger. She original wanted the T99 in purple, comes to find out it was being discontinued, which i am glad caused otherwise she would not have the water proof feature, much as she love to swim. Just purchased a 3D Sony Bravia TV, which is PERFECT cause she can shoot 3D photos which turns out nice. Overall, she wanted this camera because she want something small to keep in her purse at all times. I have a DSLR camera which is kinda heavy and she hates carrying it around.

It works underwater without any problem - be sure to clean it in fresh water after each use(instructions included with camera)2. It is small and easy to carry in your purse or pocket - buy the protective screen cover (2 for about $12-worth the investment)3. Panoramic pictures are just sweet!4. Hot pink color is just fun and touch screen screen works great.5. I bought it in a package so the memory card, camera case, cleaning stuff, etc came with it for $239, about the same as buying the camera seperately.Cons:1. As with all cameras with only a screen to view your subject, (no viewfinder), when ussed in bright sunlight, it is sometimes very difficult to see your subject and to change your picture mode since it is all touch screen.  I memorized where some of the main controls were on the screen and I was able to navigate between modes even without being able to read the detailed icons on the screen.

I got it in the color pink, which I adore :) it's very light which surprised me at first and took time to get used to, its so light you think it will break if it falls but nope I dropped it 3 times on hard tile and it didn't even scratch! It has an amazing auto focus during video mode- I do YouTube videos I use it for hauls and makeup tutorials and my viewers have even asked me what dslr I use and they are stunned when they find out I'm using a simple point and shoot style camera! It's okay in very low lighting however it is not the best in very low lighting. The pictures it takes are very clear and detailed - the macro shots are BEAUTIFUL! I mainly got this for videos, I've been using it for a year now and it's still working just like it was when I first got it. I even took it underwater - for those who say this is not waterproof then they must have not followed the directions. You can not take it in salt water or under 6 feet of water or have it in very forceful water example- putting it in a waterfall would not be a good idea. I used it to go in my fish tank so I could get good pictures of my fish and even underwater the picture quality is amazing! Now wait for the cameras mic to dry out before making a video :) it only takes 1-3 hours for the mic to dry out. I use a HD memory card as well. Overall this camera is fantastic!

Preston", "ReviewID": "RW91AB73X0JLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally going to give this camera four stars.  However, after I used it for a couple of months, and, got used to its features, I decided that five stars was more appropriate.My first \"point and shoot\" is an ancient SONY DSC T33 (5.1 Mp) Sony Cybershot DSCT33 5.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Includes Docking Station) I bought about five years ago.  It is a little beat up, but, it has worked really well, and, continues to work really well.  I love it.  I wouldn't have bought a new camera except I misplaced it for a few months and needed a new one.This camera DSC-TX10, provides three times the resolution, and I am really happy with the higher resolution.  It's hard to take a bad picture because, with the high resolution, you can electronically crop most photos into award-winning pictures, and the remaining cropped image still has plenty of resolution.This is a camera you can stick in your pocket, and, take with you, all the time.  It is compact, lightweight, sturdy enough to take jolts, bumps and an occasional fall.  You can keep it in \"easy mode\" for almost instant \"point and shoots\", and, it will stay in easy mode until you exit into the more complicated functions.  I cherish the simplicity.  I have 22 years of education, and, many years of technical experience.  I am no \"technophobe\".  However, as I mature, I find my life bleeding away and I don't want to spend it buried in technical manuals for gadgest that are supposed to be enhancing my life, and, giving me more time for important things.This camera does the job.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "I've had this everywhere with me since 2011.", "Author": "J. Morgan", "ReviewID": "R3FOIOFO7VF3EZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I absolutely adore this camera. Since I do like it very much, I'll start with the Cons!-Paint is ~~easily~~ scratched. If you plan on getting this thing out at the beach be very careful about sand getting into the sliding front. I am OCD as hell and mine still managed a scratch when I took one second to not pay attention.-The battery life is TERRIBLE on video mode. I easily breeze through my 3 batteries with this.-It shoots double-photos ALL the time. Not sure if it's a software issue, but I can't seem to turn it off. Second photo is always horrible.-It has some issues thinking it can be in Macro all the time.-The panoramic and 3D shots are \"cute\" but not good quality.-Shaky images, pet photos take patience! And a well-trained little mutt to keep still long enough!-Not a great quality when zooming.-NO MANUAL SETTINGS! You can adjust the WB a little, a little exposure, but nothing, and I mean nothing important comes from this camera if you want control of your images. It's simply a Point-And-Shoot to any extent.Now if you still care,Pros:I love it. It's tiny, easily fits into my bag with it's little case, and easily can bring along my 3 batteries, and a couple extra SD cards.Never had any issues with it destroying SDs, my old camera bricked a few.Batteries are very cheap for it. Tiny tripod is as well, which is nearly a must for keeping this camera still if you have shaky hands.Crisp images. Hi res. Plenty of settings and sizes for images. A couple for video.Very easy to use. Dummy proof. Very fun still with the settings even for those who know how to use a manual camera.Works best in high light, outdoors, can take very clear images of quick-shutter when enough light is provided.It's just.. really really convenient, and all my other cameras have had some sort of issue after 2.5 years of HEAVY use.No issues with weather, battery corrosion, software (other than double-shots), and it's just my little workhorse.Videos look and sound fantastic. Minimal wind noise. It's actually a really strong mic, too.It doesn't make any \"scary\" noises like lens sounds or have any strange notification beeps that could possibly ward off wilderness shots.Finally, it IS Waterproof. I check the seal every time before putting it into water. It's been in Mexico and Florida's oceans, as well as a few pools and fish tanks. I have had -zero- leaks. It's also tiny enough to go into a small waterproof wallet-bag, which I admit I used one the first couple times out of paranoia.I admit, it could be very easy for the seal to become compromised.And it is a shame, but the standard warranty (1 year) that comes with the camera is a Sony Basic Plan. They can easily tell you that it is impossible for them to care about your water-related issue, because it is a bulk warranty, and simply means that you throwing cocacola on your HDTV means they don't have to fix it for you. For an item like this, the warranty really should be revised... But they don't have to and obviously don't care to. Even if it's supposed to be advertised for being in the water, they are being kind of jerks about it. So I feel sorry for those who have had issues.If you are worried, be like crazy me and spend a little extra on the 3 year ADH protection plan that does include water damage. It might be worthwhile. Especially if you plan on keeping it a long time like I have.Sorry for the long amount of text!

I formerly owned the Sony TX9 which is an absolutely wonderful camera to work with.  Im into photography, and creating a nice photo, but often dont want to be carrying around a bulky camera.  This camera (tx9) wasnt much more than another cell phone, which I liked.  The touch screen response was amazing! I loved the interface, navigating photos and settings were effortless.  And just the speed of operation in the camera was excellent, looking through photos was instant. From the moment i slide the shutter down, to when I can take a pic, was surprisingly quick.  All these things are what I expected and more from the TX10.  This is not what I got though.  Even from the 1st day of operation, i didnt like the response of the touch screen.  It was almost like you had to wait after touching it so it could process. This was the same way I felt when looking through pictures! I dont know if sony put a lower quality \"processor\" in the TX10, but in every aspect of operation, thats how it seems. Then at 7 months, the touch screen just kinda stopped working intermittently.  Now at 8 months, it completely failed.  Also, the camera says that the battery is not a compatible accessory, or to use a sony battery (the one I use came with the camera) which then makes the camera shut off. If this camera were to operate as it should, it would be a truly amazing camera, because it does take really nice photos for a tiny camera.  Also, you might not even notice that the camera lags, and just assume that's just how its supposed to be, but since I did have the previous model, and know how it should be responding, I am not impressed. So disappointing, because the TX9 was a trooper for almost 2 years, and still operated like brand new, til I dropped it in water (hense the reason I got a \"waterproof\" camera).Bottom line is, the TX10 just didnt feel right, especially coming from the quality I knew to expect from its previous model.

Wow!  The clarity is superb, video quality is awesome and I would highly recommend for anyone looking to purchase a waterproof camera.  The start up time that most people complain about is no big deal.  The only problem I have with this camera is the fact that they don't send you a charger to charge the battery outside of the camera.  Stupid little accessory you need to purchase.  Annoying considering you're spending more than $300 for it.  Would I buy again if needed?  Most definitely for the quality of the photos and video and it's waterproof.  We will see if half years time if I need to update this review.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony proprietary USB cable meant no vacation photos..", "Author": "Mike Patnode", "ReviewID": "RUV4CYF1TFU2C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera takes fantastic photos and video for its size.  Easy and fun to use and you simply can't beat the shutter lag (IE: it takes fast photos).  Haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but from other reviews sounds like you don't want to push your luck.  My only complaint, and the reason I rated this a 3 instead of 5 is the proprietary USB cable connection needed for charging.  We accidentally picked up the Blackberry cable when packing (which is standard micro-USB) I also had a standard mini-USB in my computer bag, but Sony invented their own so they could charge their customers another $20 for it.  The camera battery was dead when we arrived in Yosemite, and we had no way to charge it.  Quite frustrating.Amazon has an OEM version for 9.99: ABC Products\u00ae replacement Sony VMC-MD3 VMCMD3 USB Cable Cord for Cyber-Shot DSC-H70, DSC-HX7, DSC-HX9, DSC-HX100, DSC-T99, DSC-T110, DSC-TX5, DSC-TX10, DSC-TX100, DSC-W350, DSC-W360, DSC-W380, DSC-W390, DSC-W560, DSC-W570, DSC-W580, DSC-WX5, DSC-WX7, DS... but it still irritates me to no end that Sony didn't go with a standard connection.  I also recommend you buy a few extra batteries Sony NP-BN1 Compatible Li-ion Battery and a stand alone charger, since the battery life is pretty low.Updated: 12/29One more irritating Sony \"feature\" is this camera does NOT appear as a standard USB disk when you plug it in to a computure.  Once again Sony created a proprietary driver that makes it difficult to move the photos off the camera.  Also, they store the videos in another directory with all sorts of meta data files that can't be used without the Sony conversion software.  This is the main reason I didn't buy the Sony NEX when I upgraded to a DSLR.  I just knew they would do more screwy stuff like that.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente compra y buen vendedor", "Author": "Herman \"OSHO\"", "ReviewID": "R2N1WNSIXJUD4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "La compra de este art\u00edculo fue muy buena, no falt\u00f3 nada y estoy muy satisfecho con el precio y todo lo que incluye.Gracias.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004H8FNHG"}}
