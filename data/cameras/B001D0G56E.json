{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice high resolution prosumer digicam with 720p HD video, optical zoom, and AA batteries", "Author": "DarthRad", "ReviewID": "R1JDJ6UKTZ2LW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a \"prosumer\" priced and sized camera with the following features:1. Uses non-proprietary batteries (this one uses 4 AA batteries)2. Capable of optical zoom during video recording (this camera does that, but see below)3. Capable of digital zoom during video recording (this camera does 5.7x digital zoom - if you turn on the digital zoom feature, you can optically zoom before starting the video record, and then zoom digitally another 5.7x from that point forward - optical zoom does not work during the video if digital zoom is turned on)4. Long zoom (15x - lens range is equivalent to 27.6mm - 414mm on a 35mm camera)5. HD video mode (1280 x 720 videos, also does regular 640 x  480 and 320 x 240  videos).Although this camera does do optical zooming during video recording, there are some downsides to this feature.  You can hear the little gear motors running during the zoom (I've posted a YouTube video so you can hear the sound - it's audible but not super loud).  The focusing in room lighting at maximum zoom is not very accurate.  There is no macro mode during video zooming.The digital image stabilization works well at low zoom, but not as well at high zoom during video recording as it does for still photos (the digital image stabilization works better in stronger light than room lighting, and so this is probably related to the low light focusing problems at high zoom).At 1280 x 720 resolution, each continuous video recording can only last for about 15 minutes (takes up 848MB-884MB with the MP4 compression).As for the rest of the camera:The digital image stabilization works very well for still photos.The mono audio is pretty good, much better than what has been posted about an equivalent series of Panasonic cameras.Like all digicams, this one drains alkaline AA batteries quickly (it comes with a set of four alkaline AAs) - use NimH batteries!The lens comes with a lens cap which is a bit loose.  Fortunately there is a strap to attach the cap to the camera.  The lens itself does not allow for any lens filter attachments.Manual mode allows for two aperture settings (f3.5-5.4  to f7-10.8 depending on zoom setting) and speeds from 1/1000 sec to 4s.  There is a nice histogram and exposure meter that lets you know how the exposure will turn out (although in my camera, the middle of the meter setting was a bit too light).The black plastic body feels a bit cheap and flimsy.  Would have liked a sturdier aluminum body.The camera comes from the factory with all the clicks and noises turned on, but you can turn them all off.There is a good macro and super macro mode (focuses down to 1cm from the lens) for still photos. However, macro mode doesn't seem to work during video recording.The flash has to be manually popped open - if it isn't, it won't pop itself open and you won't get any flash.  However, it is reasonably powerful, and can light up an entire backyard at night from 15-25 feet away.There's an HDMI plug which I haven't tested yet.  The camera body also has a micro USB plug to hook to a standard USB plug to download photos and videos from the camera.  This micro USB plug is one step smaller than the mini-USB plug.  The cover to these two plugs is rather flimsy.Lots of other features, which I haven't tested yet. I'm sure others will post in more about this cameraAll in all, a nice camera with lots of features.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "I second that emotion", "Author": "Dr. Cyber", "ReviewID": "R3981IY8OHYMNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the details on the Fuji website, I decided to wait for the release date and order this new product rather than get the S1000. I was mainly attracted by the High Definition video and the zoom capability with video.  I've only had it for a few days, so this is a preliminary review which I will probably update after I've had a little more time to put it through its paces.I generally agree with everything the first reviewer said about the camera, although it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy to me. Certainly not at this ($275.00) price point.If you don't already have two or three sets of rechargeable batteries, prepare to make the investment.  At least while you are learning to use all of the features, you are going to be draining AA's four at a time with breathtaking speed.  Nevertheless, the fact that a camera with this many bells & whistles uses a common battery size you can purchase anywhere was one of the dealmakers for me.  Once I am more familiar with the operation and options settings I expect I will not be using up the batteries quite so fast.  Fuji says 400 shots with rechargables, 300 with Alkalines, and 600+ with Lithiums.The little rubber cover for the USB/HD connectors makes me wonder about its durability.  It's a little hard to pull open all the way (maybe that will loosen up a bit with more use), and I worry that one overly energetic yank will either break the tiny cord that attaches it to the camera or pull it out completely.  Be careful with  this.The optical 15x zoom with video does work well (except for the motor noise which does get faithfully recorded on the soundtrack).  It is selectable for optical or digital zoom, so if you can't live with the noise, you can work around it.  The digital zoom with video is quite limited, though: only 2x at VGA or lower and only 3x in HD.For still pictures the 15x zoom is extremely impressive, and when combined with the digital zoom you can get over 85x total magnification.  With the dual image stabilization switched on, I have taken handheld pictures in bright sunlight at the maximum zoom and gotten useable -if not razor sharp- images.  I think Fuji have done a really good job with this.  You'll see things in your photos that you can't make out with the naked eye.  You have optical zoom capability in macro mode, and digital zoom only in \"super\" macro.The HD video looks really good, but one caveat.  If you're planning on watching the videos on your computer, you're going to need a relatively powerful system.  I think Fuji says at least a Core2Duo @ 2GHz or higher & 1 Gig of RAM minimum.  I have a first generation MacBook with a 2GHz CoreDuo and 2GB of RAM, and the HD will play soothly in Quicktime, but only if the \"high quality video\" option is disabled in the program preferences. Otherwise it's choppy.  Whether it's activated or not I am unable to see any difference in the \"quality\" of the images, the only difference is the smoothness of the playback.If I have anything I consider a negative, it's this:  Fuji seems to be eliminating the included AC power adapters and sockets on their cameras.  I have a FinePix 6800Zoom and it has a socket that you can directly plug into, but for this far more  power hungry camera you have to buy a separate AC adapter and a separate adapter to connect THAT to the camera. (Yes, you read that correctly.)  Combined cost for these gizmos is over $60.00 currently, and seems a bit steep to me.  Especially since they imply that you should use an AC adapter when connecting the camera to a computer.  If you need it for proper operation, it ought to be included, seems to me.  How much would it have cost them to just put a socket connector right on the camera?  With volume manufacturing I can't imagine that it would have been more than a few pennies.  Then you would only be out the $25 or so for the AC unit.That point aside, I like it very much, so far.  Recommended.This is an update on October 17, 2008:I have now taken over 3000 photos with this camera, and I like it more now than I did when I first reviewed it.Additional specifics:  The flash is quite powerful when needed outside at night...it lights up my whole backyard.The auto white balance handles most fluorescent lighting very well, no need to preset it.Edit December 2008:  As of the end of December, this camera has dropped over $50 in price since I got mine, making it an even better deal.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very cute, but maddening to use at times", "Author": "J.K. (self-confessed mac & pc geek)", "ReviewID": "R2Z36VI3LW33F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Finepix S2000HD review:After two weeks of hands-on work with this camera, I've concluded it's very cute and does many things well but it can be frustrating to use.What it does well:* In good light, it takes photos and high definition video which are sharp and have good color saturation.* The tiny flash is surprisingly powerful, even when lighting a fairly large room.* It offers a wide range of image sizes and formats (ie., 16:9, 3:2, etc.)* It takes excellent close-up photos of flowers, insects, etc.* It has some interesting and useful features including high speed (33 fps) photography at 3MP, red-eye reduction, etc.* It's extremly cute (like a baby dSLR) and easy to carry around.Why it's maddening:* The electronic viewfinder (EVF) functions like a traditional optical viewfinder. When using the EVF, however, you must continue looking through it to see the image you just shot as the latter doesn't appear on the camera's main viewscreen after you take it. The logic is you only use the EVF when it's too bright to see the main viewscreen, however, I'd  like to be able to use the EVF to save on batteries and use the main viewscreen to confirm my photos after each shot.* The camera menus are frustratingly inconsistent between different camera modes. For example, some modes allow you to change the ISO while other modes allow only \"auto\" ISO. The auto-only option should ONLY be on the auto mode.* Setting the shutter speed and aperature isn't entirely intuitive. To increase the shutter speed, for example, you have to push the down arrow button. I know, push down to admit less light, but I don't think that way when shooting. If I want a faster shutter speed, I should be pushing the up arrow button.* When setting aperature, you're only given a choice of two aperature settings (f3.5 and f7 when on wide angle, for example). If I'm adjusting the aperature, I'd like to set it to any setting I desire, not just two.* The macro and super-macro modes require separate button clicks to activate and deactivate. In the field, this quickly gets annoying, especially when similar video closeups don't require the same adjustments. If closeups work when shooting video, they should also work with still photos.* No threads for lens filters. I have a skylight 1A filter on all of my SLRs and dSLRs. With a little camera like this one, I'd like it to have the same protection for its lens.* No battery level indicator until the batteries are almost entirely drained.* The full camera manual is a PDF on CD. For a camera that definitely requires you to read the manual to get reasonably comfortable (or at least minimally frustrated) with it, a printed full manual is a must-have.What's unacceptable:* When shooting toward the sun (not necessarily directly at it, but with the sun at your face), the viewfinder image takes on a strong bluish tinge which is distracting. The photos themselves are fine, but forget trying to judge color accuracy when looking through what looks like a clear, blue shower curtain.* The \"blue shower curtain\" effect IS a problem on your final result when shooting lower resolution video (620x480 or 320x240). Face toward a major light source such as the open sky and your low-rez videos will have a noticeable blue curtain \"falling\" down the screen at those bright spots.* Ridiculously short battery life. I like using AA batteries and have two Pentax dSLRs in which battery life isn't an issue. Why this little camera goes through AAs like popcorn is an engineering problem IMHO.* Zooming while shooting video sounds like a zipper zipping and unzipping on the audio. When shooting, plan on editing out any zoom-transitions you have in your video later.Bottom line: I *want* to like this camera, but it's annoying enough that I haven't fallen in love with it. Hopefully many of the issues above can be addressed with a software update. The hardware issues, however, make the camera feel like it's still not ready for prime-time.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the price/device *updated*", "Author": "Kuro", "ReviewID": "R1SR51XCF1EATS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really don't know what some people here think they are reviewing but this is not a DSLR it is a bridge camera.  Its supposed to between DSLR and consumer point and shoot.  You should be buying this camera for complete DSLR in a smaller / more convient package (that would be worth much more money, look @ fuji's S100fs $600)  Myself I don't want a DSLR simply because it is too much camera for the shots I take but Point and Shoots don't cut it, if this is you then bridge camera's are for you.There are two main things I look for in camera's these days, Zoom (Optical of course, digital is quite useless) and Movie Mode.  You see I find myself taking as many videos as pictures, or at least a good portion.  And to all those how say get a camcorder well I have this to say: I am not an amuteur film maker, I am making short movies to document things I need simple but nice video and I still like excellent picture quality and I am not taking two devices everywhere I go.That said the zoom on this is amazing and the Image stabilization works incredibly well in both picture and movie mode.  I was filming a look-out tower the next mountain over from the castle at full zoom and it was quite stable very nice.  There is some barrel distortion at either extreme but it is not that noticable to myself.Of course the other thing was movie mode which is 720P, I was doubling MP from my old camera figured I should also do the same for video, that and all my displays are at least 1080P (and calibrated,  including the 80\" projector) so HD(720p) was required.  The big thing about the fuji was it used the general MP4 codec instead of apple's useless quicktime that is so horrible at backward compatabilty and platform/application specific.  This is why I did not go Panasonic or Olympus (plus thye cost more with features not needed.)  Yes there is noise in movie mode from the zoom if you zoom fast but you can slow and it won't be noticable at least you have the option, most camera's do not give you the option and forceable limit the zoom speed to quite it down.Picture quality is quite nice.  The option for aspect ration is nice since all my displays are widescreen but you sometimes want a nice full frame as well.  My displays are also calibrated and I have taken pictures of them and the room around them (projected on wall) and the colors match perfectly, its the best comparison test I could think of. There are quite a few scene modes which is quite helful and manual options are almost to much I have had to read up to learn how to use half of them, my previous camera had aperature and shutter control, this has much much more.High speed modes are quick and shutter lag is nearly non existent.  As far as battery power I sot 2GB of photos over the course of a day plus a few videos and never had the low batt light come on, of course I am using NiMH 2800 mah so there is some juice behind them.  As far as flimsy usb cover I could care less since I just pull my SD card and plug direclty into my card reader, much easier and the SD door is quite robust.  In fact the whole camera is, yes its plastice but very sturdy and nicely textured, if you want a metal body find a camera for $500 or more.  The lens cap I was also initially wary about but it stays on nicely and since it is not the clip kind is very easy to take on and off in a hurry.  I've had mine since the first days they came out in the begining of Sep and have had no issues with it.So in summary know what camera you are shopping for this does exactly wht its supposed, with a great combination of features all for and extremely low price ($100 less than the competitors.)There are a few things I would like to mention that are in other reviews that I belive stem from lack of using the right-setting.Battery Life - Some seem to have problems here, as stated above I get very good battery life out of the camera, however I have set it properly.  Tha camera asked you to set the type of battey (just a pop-up reminder not the actual menu) whenever you change the batteries with the current setting displayd.  It has Akaline, Li-Ion (non-rechargable), and Ni-MH.  So make sure you change it to get optimum battery life, also Fuji recommends not to use Ni-Cad.Red-Eye - again some say there are serious issues, yet I cannot get red-eye when using the red-eye mode WITH face detection, which what you are supposed to do, whether these publicatious even have red-eye flash on is not mention, nor face detection.  There is the option to use face detection without red-eye removal as well (don't know what for, maybe later removal?) face detection is new to me, but I can still turn it on and get great pictures.  Without it all the camera is doing is the standard double flash for prevention of red-eye not removal, and of-course prevention doesn't always work (actually red-eye flash in my experience only prevents red-eye 1/3 of the time in any camera.)Auto ISO - this is in Scene, Natural (basically a scene) and auto modes, which make sense to me, if you are selecting automatic options, why wouldn't ISO be automatic, these auto modes depend on limiting what the user can set to intrepet what would be the best setting and doing it itself.  If you want ISO control it is available in the manual modes where it should be.Zoom Noise - again control your speed when zooming when you can (the zoom speed is dependant on how much you pull the zoom switch)  If you need to zoom in fast you can, at the expense of some noise from the zoom mechanics being picked-up, but at least you have the option.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Some compromises, but a tremendous value!", "Author": "J. Hamar", "ReviewID": "R94FAUAQKPX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing a lot of research to find the right \"hybrid\" camera.  I had several requirements:1. HD Video - I got my first HD set in November Samsung LN46A750 46-Inch 1080p DLNA LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Color, an incredible LCD by the way!  Figured I might as well utilize it.2. MPEG4 or H.264 video compression - This is the latest, and best, video compression.  Blu-Ray uses H.264 so that should give you an idea.  Plus it reduces the size of the video quite a bit.  My other reason for this was that I got a PS3 along with the TV PlayStation 3 80GB.  I am now in the process of ripping all of my DVDs and encoding to H.264.  I put them on an external USB 2.0 hard drive and attach it to the PS3.  I can then play all of my movies straight off the PS3!  No more putting DVDs in and out, my girls scratch them up anyway.  So the PS3 plays H.264 and MPEG4 but not in .mov (Quicktime) format.  There are only a couple of cameras that save in this format, this is one of them.  So I can save them directly to the external hard drive and play my videos.3. Desire: long zoom - self explanatory4. Image stabilization - absolutely necessary for video and long zoom5. Decent pictures - shouldn't this be at the top of my list?  Well, the other criteria are much more difficult to find and a lot of the cameras anymore take good pictures.With that in mind, there were only a few choices.  The Sony Cybershot DSC-T500 10.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization is a neat camera that looks to have very good video.  The problem, it will only last about 15 minutes on its battery when using video.  Pretty much unusable.The Sanyo Xacti HD700 7MP MPEG-4 High Definition 720p Camcorder with 5x Optical Zoom (Brown).  This gets some mixed reviews and I am somewhat skeptical about the picture quality.  I have followed these since they were first introduced.  I think Sanyo has a great idea and will continue to improve these cameras.  I don't think they are quite the quality of other camera manufacturers.  Love the form factor though!Canon Powershot SX10IS 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom is a great camera!  It has MPEG4, but puts it into a Quicktime format (.mov) and is not HD.  Oh well.Kodak EasyShare Z1015IS 10MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom looks really good.  Has all the right features but it saves movies in Quicktime.  This can be overcome by using Quicktime Pro to do a container change from .mov to .mp4.  This does work with SOME cameras.  I couldn't find a video sample for this camera to try though.  Keep watching Kodak, they have a new Z980 coming out with a 24x zoom.  That looks great!Casio Exilim EX-FH20 7MP 20x Zoom 3-Inch LCD Digital Camera with 26mm Wide Angle Lens (Black).  I have a Casio Z750 which is a fantastic camera.  Casio is highly underrated as a camera manufacturer.  It consistently takes very good pictures in any conditions.  The FH20 has come groundbreaking features like its big brother Casio Exilim Pro EX-F1 Digital Camera, 6.0 MP, with 60fps High Speed Burst Mode, Full HD Movies, 12x Optical, 4x Digital Zoom, 2.8\" HP LCD Screen but costs as much as a DSLR.  Unfortunately out of my budget right now.  Another manufacturer to keep your eye on.So that left the Fuji S2000HD.  It met all of the criteria so I went to the store to try it.  I really liked how it operated.  The video is very nicely stabilized and it has some really nice shooting features that will surprise you.  For instance the high speed continuous shooting.  You can get 13.5 fps for 30 frames, all be it at 5 MP.  But this is really cool for certain situations.After playing with it I was convinced.  I was all set to order from Amazon, which is where I buy a lot of my stuff, but Best Buy had an open box for $200.  This allowed me 14 days to return with no restocking fee so I went for it.So far so good.  I will say a couple of things about what I have observed so far.  The movies and pictures are a little \"soft\" when indoors.  Flash pictures are very good, I turned down the flash a little.  The HD movies are very good so far.  Other than being a little grainy indoors, they look very good on my LCD.  The sound seems very good even though it is mono.  The focusing is quick and accurate.  The face detection works pretty well, but not as good as the Kodak and Canons that I looked at.  The Kodak was tracking my daughter as she walked sideways in front of me, pretty impressive!  I like the fact that it has AAs, then I can get good AA NIMH batteries.Anyway, for now if you are looking for any of the above combinations of features this is a real contender.  If it had a little better lens and sensor it would be unbeatable.  For the price, it is a tremendous value.I will follow up as I take more pictures and video.

I still use my old Nikon N40 35mm but at a recent family party the younger kids teased me about my old camera. The only \"digital\" I have is my cell phone. So it was time to upgrade. After lots of research, I almost bought a point&shoot; Canon, but on a trip to Costco, I saw the Fuji s1000 and really liked it. While checking the price on Amazon I found the s2000hd and for $50 more decided to buy it.Today's 1st day pics and videos surpassed my expectations. Remember I am not a pro, but the menus are all intuitive and the settings were easy to learn. I did spend a couple hours reading the manual and testing things out. After that I printed the 2 \"camera display\" and \"mode dial\" pages from the manual (which is on a CD) so I'd have something to refer to while walking the neighborhood and taking pics. For those who said they'd like a paper user manual - if you have a CD, you can print JUST the 2 or 3 pages you need to use. Save a tree.This is a wonderful camera for someone who wants more than a point&shoot;, but who doesn't want a higher end DSLR. It's so easy to take great pictures and videos. I love the macro zoom - my roses never looked more beautiful - sharp, clear and bright colors.It did suck up the batteries at first but that was just me trying out EVERY setting and function.

Yes, you do see lines when aiming to direct light but the images are wonderful.  I was a little dissappointed at first (for about an hour) when I first started taking pictures but after I spent that first evening reading the manual and playing with the various settings (about 1.5 hours) I am now in love with it.  I previously had a kodak that went kaputz on me within 10 months but my other fuji has lasted 5 years and while a very basic model-still takes the same quality pics as the day it came out of the box (which is why I decided on Fuji again).  I can take pics in a darker room with no flash and they turn out wonderful.  I have taken over 500 pictures since i bought it and am only on my second set of batteries which is still going strong.  You need to make sure you select the right battery when you put new ones in to maximize the life.  I love the continuous shooting mode--that was the test for me and it is a wonderful feature.  I love the control you have over quality used.  I do highly recommend printing the manual--pages 70-93 or so for sure and reviewing them and I highly recommend playing with the various settings as it will help you get the most of your camera.

I'm still learning about it. Colors are vibrant & I have taken some pretty amazing shots with it. As mentioned in another review there are sometimes purple smears on the LCD screen when the camera is pointed at a very bright light. I don't know where he got his info that this is a camera defect but I looked this up on Fuji's website and here is what it said:When composing an image, vertical stripes appear on the viewfinder and LCD screen. However the vertical stripes are not displayed on the played back image or downloaded image on the PC.This symptom (CCD smear) is not a camera defect. When the camera receives strong incident light on focal plane, the image signal temporally over flows internally inside the image capture device (CCD), and appear as vertical lines.However when the shutter is released, the amount of the light coming into the image capture device is controlled by the aperture and shutter speed; Therefore the recorded image does not show vertical stripes. This problem is usually noticeable during framing or movie mode.So, apparently this is not a defect.

Serrano", "ReviewID": "R112XSLOKRZ6XS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a xacti hd1000.  It takes very good videos and I decided to to purchase a camera to replace my old fujifilm s3800.  I Now have a s2000hd which I purchased from circuit city when it went out of business.  I saw the price and I saw the camera features and I thought to myself, \"this is a good deal!\"It's been about a month and have taken shots of family out in the park.  I can tell you a few things about the camera.1-  it takes high contrast pics and adds even higher contrast2-  Color is very saturated3-  some noise even at low iso4-  chromatic aberration at super macro mode.5-  Some blurry super macro pics can be achieved if your hand is not steady enough but you can get some sharp pictures with practice.You either love the camera or you hate it.  For my super macro pics which has chromatic aberration, I use gimp and a plug in called \"chromatic aberration\" to fix the problem.  The results are excellent.  For the color saturation and contrast problem, for the really nice pics, I use bloom and Fake HDR in gimp to fix the issue.  I love it.  For picture noise, I found running the camera at 10 mega pixels images to be too noisy anything over 400 iso so force 400 auto in p setting or use 100.  400 for night shots are fine.The HD feature is excellent but no were near my xacti hd1000.  The audio is not that great compared to my hd1000 as well but this camera serves as an excellent backup in case I don't have a hd recorder around.I noticed some ccd smear.  This appears as blue vertical streaks caused by massive light source through your lcd screen.  WHen you hold the button halfway, this shows the true image you are going to take and that take has no ccd smear.  Pictures never show ccd smear.  There is also a firmware upgrade which kind of helps with the ccd smear issue.for a 180 dollar camera, this is the best camera I have ever owned.  I am giving it a 5 star rating because if you payed for this at this price range, it is a dead on deal.  Compared to other cameras even at this price, noboby's product can match it even in quality.  If I payed for this camera at about 250 dollars plus, I would rate it at a 3.5.  3.5 just because it takes a bit of time to use the advanced features and time to understand what is going on with the camera and why sometimes the shots do not come out the way you expect it.If you are a beginner, do not use auto mode.  Use the SP mode and select the correct scene.  I found if I used flash in auto, the flash supersaturated the scene with light.  It has a way powerfull flash.  If you use the sp mode with the correct scene, the picutres come out perfect.  Auto mode is terrible.  It loves high iso for non flash at nights and even at night with flash it uses high iso.The sweet spot of this camera is program ae or P mode.  Use sharp image setting in menu, use multispot, compensate for blown highlights with the +- aka exposure button manually.  Use iso 100 and at night use flash.  This camera takes excellent pictures this route.  Using program AE sounds difficult but its not.  It works like automatic but you set your camera how you want it.  Automatic settings don't detect scenes correct so this will help those of you who are pressed on having good, sharp, noisless pictures.Chrome in the F button adds extra color and extra contrast.  It is like a mini HDR but without it being dynamic in the spots where it counts.  It is a nice feature and i tend to play with this in many of my shots.  Chrome works very well and gives images an interesting look.This camera is excellent.  If you want natural looking pictures with a sharp look, you can achieve it but with great difficulty.  If you want something that pops out and makes for some interesting shots, this is good for it.  I find myself looking at the images not for its natural look but for the unreal and artistic look.  Top these images with a HP 2408w monitor with a 92% gamut color saturation, It is way amazing.Other cameras I have looked at where thepanasonic fz28 (excellent minus color is too bland and outputs too much barrel distortion for my taste and also the proprietary battery system stinks)canon sx10 is (excellent natural picture taking camera with very \"not-so-sharp\" images but the chromatic aberration leaves me thinking why it costs so much.  aa battery is a plus-non proprietary).  Between these 2, the fz28 wins hands down in sharpness.laters", "Date": "April 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value For Not Yet Pro Photographer", "Author": "max7", "ReviewID": "R2137BZGGFMLPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read many of the reviews on this camera before and after I purchased it and the biggest issue I have with the S2000HD is the proprietary USB ports/cables -- a shameless and unnecessary grab at our wallets by FujiFilm.  Aside from that, this camera has everything a serious amateur photographer could want at a price that is unbeatable.I saw the S700 about a year ago at local RadioShack and I was very tempted to buy that camera but held off since it did not have true IS (neither mechanical nor optical).  A friend of mine did buy it and loved it; he bought some filters for it and his photos were amazing.  This was very influential in my decision to purchase the S2000HD since it has the same basic specs as the S700 with many added features; if a lesser model could produce such \"finepics\", surely an upgraded version would do that and more.  I'm glad to say, my logic was correct!Before purchasing the S2000HD, I went to 3 top digital camera review websites.  A close contender for my money was the Canon SX110 IS.  Since I already owned the Canon Optura 20 and the A620, I was leaning towards getting the Canon since I was already familiar with their products and had some compatible accessories.  In fact, the SX110 garnered a point to point and half higher rating on all three reviews I read which was not surprising to me.  While not a huge difference it was enough to make me pause: was the S2000HD the wiser choice; more bang for the buck but I knew Canon and although pricey, in my mind it would be the sure bet.  Canon = quality which tends to be true most of the time.On November 21st, I took my vows with the S2000HD and from the first moment I removed it from the box up to now just over a month later, my love has only grown.A word on battery consumption: a few reviews have lodged complaints that the batteries do not last long.  This has not been an issue for me at all; in fact I have been impressed with the battery life considering the large LCD display on the back.  I have a feeling people are not setting the battery type in the main setup menu correctly or they might have bad batteries.Last word: for the serious amateur on a budget, the S2000HD is worth every penny.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "KristenTag", "ReviewID": "R38HQ9CN4I8DE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this camera at Best Buy and loved it but came online to look at reviews.  I was a little concerned because it definitely got some mixed reviews.  I went back to Best Buy to look at it again (I just need to see things in person sometimes) and ran in to the Fuji rep who was servicing the store.  She was an AMAZING help to me.  She showed me tons of features on the camera that I might not have known about.  I also started asking her about some of the issues I saw in these reviews and she answered each one perfectly.  It boils down to the fact that people get used to the way that one camera does things and then expects future cameras to do the same.  Most of the time they are different.  This is a great camera but you really need to learn how to do things.  I'm a mom and getting great (and fast) pictures of my kids were my main concerns.

Even my tiny Nikon micro-handheld camera goes down to an f3.3; and this Fuji with the nice big lens only goes down to 3.5?  C'mon.  Most superzoom cameras these days go down to f2.8, which provides much better image quality by allowing lower ISO and faster shutter speeds.  The lack of adjustablity in the aperature is disappointing; you really can only choose either a 3.5 or 7.0 (nothing in between).  When at maximum zoom, even on a bright sunny day, image quality is sub-par.  Image distortion is apparent and there is a very noticeable \"purple fringe\" effect.  Image sharpness at this zoom level is also not as sharp as you would expect from a $280 camera.  These are my biggest complaints.  But wouldn't you consider these MAJOR FLAWS; I mean, why would you even buy a superzoom camera at this pricepoint if you didn't want nice looking pictures?The camera is comfortable to hold, and is a nice compact size, compared to other cameras in it's class.  It's features compare nicely to the competition.  The 15x zoom is nice; unless you're using a tripod, more zoom than that would be difficult to use.  The flash is acceptable, if a bit harsh.  Macro mode is easy to use, and movie mode does work as advertised.  The menus are sub-par.Overall, I would only consider this camera a good value if you could get it for $100-$150.

The line wasn't apparent 80% of the time, but was a distraction on a new camera.  I got an RMA from Amazon and returned it yesterday.  The defect didn't appear on any of the pictures when viewed on the computer.I currently have a Casio EX-Z600 - a 6 megapixel vs the Fuji's 10.  The pictures from my 2 1/2 year old Casio are definitely equal to, and in some instances better than the Fuji.  I especially wanted the macro in the Fuji to be superior, but after taking several pictures in a restaurant with both the Fuji and the Casio, at the same time - alternating, even my wife said the macro pictures taken with the old Casio were more colorful, showed more detail, and showed significantly less noise that did the Fuji (when viewed on a 22\" HP widescreen monitor).  Question now is whether the Fuji was defective other than for the LCD display.  I suspect not.I liked this camera - I found the controls to be very intuitive and easy to use.  I really liked the 16x zoom.  The lens cap pops off easily, but this is necessary because when you turn the camera on, the lens does extend just an inch or so.  The lens cap does need to fit loosely so that it will pop off if you forget it when powering the camera on.  The cap has a small string to attach it so it doesn't get lost.  I purchased 8 rechargeable hybrid AA batteries, and a 16 GB SD card for this camera, but I'm not going to buy another and may wind up not using either the batteries or SD card.

The amazing feature list for the price was the attraction. However, its definitely a mixed bag.Pros:Capable of very high quality shots, at least in good conditions.Build quality: Finish and feel quite good, with some exceptions.HD capable movies makes for a larger movie image on your PC.Long zoom range with wide angle.Cons:Noise in low light (not unusual in this price range, but I feel this is somewhat below average)LCD blanks out or shows severe color striping when pointed at a light source, making it difficult to see your image.HD movie quality is varied; has difficulty maintaining focus if subject is moving. Overall, even though its HD, I've been more impressed by videos from some cheaper, non HD cameras.Controls are not the best designed and some things are awkward. To invoke the self timer, for example, you have to access the menu, there's no button like on the Panasonic to do it quickly.Focus problems in still photos, especially at long zooms and close ups. There were times when I could not get  a sharp focus at all on distant subjects at long zooms.Battery life good but not great with rechargeable NIMHs. Bad with regular alkalines. ( I actually prefer a proprietary battery such as the Panasonic uses; lighter, longer lasting, quicker charge, more compact charger, easier to load 1 battery instead of 4, etc. The supposed big benefit of using regualr alkalines in a pinch is offset by cost of them for the amount of photos you can get from a set; just buy a spare proprietary battery, keep it charged and you'll be better off. Besides, with the Fuji you have to buy your own charger and multiple sets of batteries, so add at least $20 to the price)The battery door developed a gap over time; enough to allow moisture into the compartment - not good. Also had trouble loading the batteries/closing the door quickly and on a couple of occaisons the door popped open, casting the batteries on the ground.Finally, I had a problem with my camera shutting down on me during use in damp and cold conditions in New Zealand. It would act dead for a while until it had 'rested'. Then, soon after, the LCD screen went dead and never came back. Good thing there's a viewfinder to rely on. Some other Fuji users have had this issue as well - dying LCDs. By the way, make sure you keep your warranty card ( I tossed mine out) because Fuji (and some others too) require you to send it in for warranty repair.If I had to do it over again, I'd get another Panasonic, such as the FZ28 - even though its about $100 more, its no doubt worth it: better design, quality and photos overall.", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm delivers a great camera", "Author": "Marissa", "ReviewID": "R26QJ7K5Z4L3TQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using an older model fujifilm camera before i purchased this one.

The features I really like on this camera are the super micro and natural light settings. The setting where you can take two pictures one with natural light, and one with flash is really helpful in dim lighting. I would not recommend this camera for the very casual user, it is nice but if you are planning to take it to the theme park or beach then you might find it a bit big and bulky.

Even my husband has stated that he is happy that I updated my camera as the photos that I am taking now are awesome!  I am even reading up on how to take better pics with lighting and so on.  I am not ready for a SLR as simple is better for me and having the point and shoot option is very attractive.What I would suggest is go and try this camera out and see what you can achieve.  I don't think that you will be disappointed.....I know that I'm not!INITIAL PURCHASE 2009 - I didn't purchase this camera through Amazon but decided that, due to the frustration that I went through in the in depth research, perhaps this can be of help to others who are venturing into updating their camera, so......This camera is amazing and I am totally in love with what it can achieve.I researched and researched cameras for weeks and visited many camera stores without being given any real information.  In the end I was becoming confused and downhearted and almost gave in.  Of course everyone has an opinion on what is the best camera etc etc etc and I researched them all, however it did seem that every camera shop I walked into wanted me to buy Canon.  Well, I have never appreciate the hard sell, so unless it was proved that Canon was the ultimate (and I still need to be convinced on that one) I decided that I wasn't going to buy a Canon!  I looked at all different sorts of Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and all looked to be good but not achieve what I needed in MY camera!In the end, I walked into a local John Ralph Camera Store, and as luck would have it, a kind and very experienced women finally asked me the relevant questions.  Not what type of camera or brand, but WHAT exactly did I need the camera to do and what was the most important aspects required.  FINALLY someone ready to listen!I am an animal practitioner and an important aspect of my work is to take before and after photos of animals in movement, in dim environments and I need a camera that can also get up really close without disturbing and document was is happening in the animal's body.I also work with horses so there are times that I am required to be able to take detailed pics of an animal that may be a distance away, and not have to be an SLR camera expert to do so!The pricing was also important so that I didn't have to mortgage my house in order to buy a decent camera that could do all that I need it to do.After discussion and taking in the facts, she showed me 2 bridging cameras, one being the Fujifilm s2000HD, and also showed me the quality of the pictures that it took.I was sold!  And even though it was a little more than I anticipated it is so worth the extra dollars to me.Also the factor that it can take such awesome detailed pictures in macro as close as 1cm was awesome. Now I have had this camera for a few weeks now and am still discovering all the bibs and bobs that I need to know, but on the whole I am ecstatically happy with the results.I am still working out exposure, aperture and shuttle and so on, and I am not that excited about needing to continually read the instructions via a cd, but this camera has truly inspired me to become inventive and more creative with my photos, both within my work and outside.  I actually attended a class which is a surprise even to me!Truly, unless you are anal and obsessive in your expectations about the specifics within a camera, I don't believe that you can go wrong with this fabulous camera, and it really doesn't cost an arm or a leg.It is relatively compact although you can't stick it in a pocket, is very comfortable to hold, and once you get the feel of the zoom, it makes taking photos a breeze.

I was using a Nikon CoolPix S550, which took great still pics, but I couldn't capture my friends surfing.  They couldn't take a pic of me surfing with my Nikon at all, which was very disappointing.  The problem was we couldn't see our surfing subjects in sunlight without a viewfinder.  The Nikon was so slow taking pics that we always missed the action shot & the wait to take the next picture seemed like an eternity.  We just couldn't capture surfing pics.  I bought the Fugi FinePix S20000HD camera to be able to see my subjects with the view finder, to capture the action quickly & to get crisp pics from a distance.  I have to admit I wasn't expecting to much for the price, but the Fuji is awesome!!  It has a view finder, but I can see my subjects with either view finder perfectly.  It is also so much faster & has so many cool settings. Best of all I am able to capture action with excellent quality.  The pics my husband has taken of me are so cool!  He captured me surfing & all my crashes with me in mid air, very detailed!!  I didn't really need a new camera, but I am so happy I made this purchase because it meets all my expectations.  I can now capture pics of my friends surfing that are of the highest quality.  You surely can't beat the price for a quality camera like this one!

After firing over 130,000 pictures through the S5000, I thought purchasing another FinePix camera would bring the same or better results. This camera has let me down!The S5000 shots at 6 megapixels with amazing clarity and color saturation. I have printed pictures up to 2' X 3' where you begin to notice the pixels. An 11\" X 17\" picture turns out sharp and crisp. When I read the specs about the S2000HD, I was excited to have picture quality with additional upgrades including a larger LCD screen, wide-angle lens, and faster `burst' picture mode for sporting events. But the results were offset by poor performance and even poorer customer service.On Halloween I shot about 100 frames of `trick or treaters' at my door. About a dozen were clear enough to see details in their costumes. I shot on the automatic mode and almost created a traffic jam as the kids had to wait for the camera to focus, set, and flash. My old camera would perform this function in less than a second while the S2000HD thought about it for several seconds then produced a poor shot. I soon learned to forget trying the automatic setting and move on to one of the pre-set shooting modes.I just returned from a cruise to the Caribbean and tried to find a `comfort level' with this unit, because like others I `wanted' to like this camera. After almost 2,000 pictures, I am here to report it did not happen.Others have reported the view finder `whiting out' when viewing a bright scene, and it frustrated me! Any shot with a bright sun forced me to take the shot `blind' hoping to catch the scene and waiting for the picture review to see what I shot. The `BEACH' scene position produced washed out results of the beach (along with the automatic setting), but the `LANDSCAPE' setting produced great colors. But don't use this setting in a medium to low light setting. After down loading the pictures today, the good color results were wiped out by poor focusing.The lens cap is a total joke. It doesn't stay on unless you keep it in a bag. After visiting the Turk Islands I was reviewing my pictures and noticed a blurred spot on the pictures. Somehow when the cap fell off I must have touched the lens and left a smudge mark thus ruining almost all the shots.The topper is trying to contact Fujifilm to ask questions. I tried their website and found the typical preset question-answers did not address my concerns, and when I tried to complete a questionnaire/problem form, the response came back after hitting the send tab that the page could not be found. I tried their technical service hot line in New Jersey for 4 hours and was told on the answering message to call back during normal hours. I called from Seattle on a Tuesday from 8:00 AM to about 1:00 PM! I tried other location and actually reached a lady in Texas who put me through to a technician. The guy could barely speak English and after several minutes finally said the focusing may need to be adjusted and send it their New Jersey facility where they would take a look at it and get it back in a couple of weeks. I was leaving the next week on vacation!The bottom line is if you haven't bought this camera....DON'T! I passed the 30 day return window for Amazon's return policy during my trip so I am STUCK with this thing.

This camera was my first Fuji. I was initially very excited over all it's features but Fuji should be ashamed they released this to the market as is.  All the reviews stating is has trouble with autofocusing and with overexposure are 100% correct. If you are lucky 2 out of 10 photos will be more or less in focus.  The rest are most likely to be blurry no matter what settings you use on the camera or overexposed.  I guess if you were willing to just do manual focus you might have a chance though.The videos are very subpar.  I was expecting to be able to hear the zoom motor during movies which you can (very loud and clear) but it was a big surprise to be able to also hear the autofocus itself when you are not zooming going \"click, click, click\" throughout the movie. Add to this the fact that the movies are as blurry as the pics and you have a dud.Finally, the LCD will inexplicably flicker (go off for a few seconds, come back on, go off for another second, and then come back on).  I would be tempted to say mine was defective but I got 2 from Amazon and they both did this. Needless to say I did not keep this camera.So then, why are some people giving this good reviews?  I can only conclude that they have never had a digicam before and hence compared to a cheap film camera the pictures look great. However, compared to a decent digital camera they are horrific.  The professional sites more or less all recommend you buy something else and I have to agree.  I just wish I had looked at their reviews closer before buying this.If you want to see some sample video from this camera go to vimeo.com and search for S2000 HD.

I wanted good zoom, good pics in low light situations, and great color images of my two daughters in their various activities.  This seemed like a good fit. I took about 50 pictures with it at my daughter's birthday party and was not pleased.  The images were washed out, not crisp; the color was off (my daughter's dark brown hair had visible orange pixels in it); and most pictures had blurry streaks where ever someone was moving.  Most noticable was a horrible shutter delay which caused me to lose many good shots of my kids... by the time the image was captured, the moment was gone.  Since most of my pictures are of children under the age of 7 in action, this was not acceptable.  I returned the camera.I ended up buying a Canon Powershot A590IS instead and am very happy with it.  Much lower price, better images, better color, much clearer focus, faster shutter speed.  The video it captures is also good quality.  Though I loved the Kodak Easyshare software, I was pleasantly surprised with the software that came with the Canon.I went crazy trying to research the best cameras for my needs and decided that you really have to just buy a camera that has the features you want and then test it out in your own environment.  You can't tell how something is going to work in the store or by talking to sales people or by reading online reviews.  Amazon has a great return policy and I got a full refund for the Fujifilm camera within a few days of sending it back.
