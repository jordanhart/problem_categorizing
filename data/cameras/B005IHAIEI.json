{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great in a lot of ways but not perfect.  Worth the spend", "Author": "Peter Singh", "ReviewID": "R1CMK1HA1ILBK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little background to give you perspective on the review. I'm an advanced amateur shooting for about 10 years.  I also own a Canon 5D Mark II with some L Zoom lenses (24-70 F2.8 and the 70-200 F2.8) and the very good 50mm 1.8 prime and a Fuji X100.I spent a lot of time (probably over 40 hours) researching this camera, reading reviews etc. before buying it on Amazon from a third party seller.  I've had it about a week now and shooting with with the Sony 18-200 Zoom Lens (SEL18200).  Below are my observations:Good:1.  Very small camera body, smaller than my X100 and feels a lot like my old S90 compact in terms of size (this is of course without the lens).  With the 18-200 lens its no longer pocketable but still small and very manageable compared to a SLR.2.  Great build quality, tough body, I like the styling and I love the handgrip.  Just the right size.3.  Probably the fastest shutter I have ever used, very little shutter lag.4.  Easy to use menus/interface etc.  Lots of options and things like sweep panorama and other \"gadget\" type things work well although unlikely that I will use them much.5.  Good battery life.  I'm easily getting the 400 or so shots per charge its rated for.6.  Electronic viewfinder - The good part is that it works really well, focus is fast even in low light, for the not so good part relating to the viewfinder see below.Not so good1.  The electronic viewfinder that gets rave reviews is simply not as good to my eyes as looking through glass.  Its a far cry from an optical viewfinder and I find the little \"noise/dots\" in low light distracting.  Images even when blown up don't seem to show the same noise so this is definitely a viewfinder issue.  To give you context even with a lens cap on when the LCD is completely black the viewfinder has tiny dots dancing on it sort of like static on a TV screen, this doesn't go away.2.  Internal Flash design needs work.  When used with the SEL18200 lens there is noticeable shadow in images due to the lens blocking some of the light, to the point where I am currently not using the flash at all and will eventually invest in an external or wireless flash.  Just simply providing the ability to bounce this off the ceiling would have helped.  UPDATE:  Someone in comments just pointed out and I verified that you can manually tilt the flash while shooting.  Solves my issue with the SEL18200, thanks.In the end what I really care about though is image quality.  In this the camera does not disappoint.  It does indoors just about as well as my Fuji X100 which to me is the best low light, auto WB adjustment under any kind of light shooter I have ever used and for landscapes and nature its almost as good as my 5D particularly in good light.  I suspect with a better lens I would be hard pressed to see the difference, right now while the 18-200 f3.5 is very versatile my Canon glass is definitely a little sharper, but at its size and lightweight appeal by guess is that the Sony will get a lot more at bats than the Canon.  Even when blown up to the size of a modern day LCD TV pictures look great and the zoom lens is great at bringing far away details closer.  The 24MP se\u00f1sor does capture a lot of detail and does well in low light situations as well.  I'm not really a high ISO shooter preferring flash or faster lenses where this becomes required but up to ISO 1600 have not noticed any issues with the picture quality even on a 63\" screen.All in all I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to many years of shooting with it.  I'd recommend it along with the SEL-18200 lens for anyone looking for a second camera as a go anywhere alternative to a SLR and lenses or as a very significant upgrade from a compact.  This could also very easily become the only camera for an enthusiast/advanced amateur type who would be willing to trade in the bulky DSLR.  I definitely hope they make more high quality lenses for it as time goes by.  I was also looking at the 24mm F1.8 Carl Zeiss prime (36mm equivalent) but in the end opted for the versatility of the zoom particularly since my X100 gives me a dedicated 35mm point of view for about the same price but with camera body attached.Update - I did some more comparisons to my X100 and liked the Nex 7 enough to sell the Fuji.  I used the proceeds to purchase the Carl Zeiss Sonnar 24mm F1.8 e mount lens.  I'm finding this lens to mitigate some of my viewfinder issues since its bright enough and the little dancing dots seem at bay but not totally gone.  Also finding this lens to be of very high quality, auto-focus is very quick and indoor low light shooting a breeze.  Portraits are sharp and background is pleasantly de-focused, even in dimly lit rooms I am not using flash or high ISOs and outdoors or in good light its beautiful.Update 2 -  I have now been using the Nex 7 for almost three months.  I have to say I love it even more.  Its become my go to camera for a lot of different occasions and I recently travelled internationally with this and the Zeiss F1.8 lens as my only camera.  Pictures of the trip came out beautiful, although I'm not much of a dedicated 35mm shooter I found that there was enough there to make me very happy and in some cases crops etc. taking advantage of the ample resolution the Nex offers strengthened particular images.  I have also added the HVL20 flash to my collection and find it to be useful in low light, indoor types of situations and pretty compact still and recently added the Tamron 18-200 lens which I am liking a little more than the Sony SEL18200 since its a little smaller, lighter and produces about the same image quality.  Vain I know but I actually like the black of the Tamron lens more.I have been doing some tests also of portraits compared to my 5D Mark II and for me at least the Full Frame bokeh of the 5D can't be beat.  I don't have a great portrait lens for the Nex yet so will reserve final judgement until I acquire one (50mm F1.8 on pre-order) but at near identical focal lengths and apertures the Canon 5D images have the 3D like pop to them that the Nex is missing ONLY when compared side by side, i.e. the Nex does render a little more detail in the background.  Outside of this extreme bit of detective work that likely has very little value in actual use I am extremely happy with Nex for portraits and for all others types of shooting including landscape with the Zeiss lens.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "The almost perfect  Nex 7", "Author": "Average User", "ReviewID": "R3SSLZS1GWQUBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I have been an avid, but not an expert photographer for 50 years.  I carry a camera with me everywhere I go. My recent cameras have included the Nikon D7000, and the Sony Alpha Nex C3 and 5n.  But I have had Canon and Panasonic cameras and video cameras I also love.  Anyway, this time, I got my wife the Nex 3c for Christmas because it shares the same 16 mp processor that is in the Nikon D7000.  To put an APS-c processor in such an inexpensive camera, I thought, would open the world of natural light photography to my wife with a sensor that's a proven winner in a small, convenient camera with interface designed for point and shoot photographers.  When I got home, my wife had our six month old daughter dressed in a Santa outfit... Break out the camera...Out of the box in five minutes the most incredible, clear, good color gorgeous detailed photos, all in natural light...we were so excited we rushed to print a Christmas card.  That simple incident has caused my wife to finally get interested in a camera more rewarding than her Casio Ex Slim.  Reading more, I decided to get myself the 5n. Same processor but with more capabilities and controls. I got many wonderful photos with the kit 18-55 but not as good as my D7000.  But then I bought the Sony 18-200 lens for the 5n. The photos and detail with this lens knocked my socks off and was every bit the quality I was getting from the D7000 for which I have an equivalent lens.  It was this experience that made me interested in the 24 mp Nex 7.  I read a few reviews of the Nex 7. I read of many features, but mainly stunning image quality.  Some commentators think that 24 mp is about the equivalent of the detail you can achieve with a film camera. I was interested.  But the one think this excercise has brought home to me, if you're seeking detail, then there's alot of other things that go into image clarity than just the sensor. And the other things get more and more evident as the megapixels are pushed. First on this list is whether you have a lens that will deliver enough detail to take advantage of the megapixels. I did crave the detail, I had the lens. So I bought the camera.  The Sony Nex 7 takes some getting used to. Its three dial system is ingenious and provides easy quick access to an functions including by example,  creativity settings, saturation and sharpness, settings to expand dynamic range, aperture, speed and iso, so that with practice you can reset all of these for every shot almost instantly.  There are many other great features also.  But mainly,  when I got the settings right, the quality of the pictures was just something I never saw before from any camera.  There are things that could be done a little better, as there always are. The flash unit is incredibly cheesy. The movie button is placed so that I have taken many movies I did not intend. Good thing they can be erased. And there is no case that fits this incredible little camera.  And it is almost shocking that with all the settings available, there is no way to save a custom profile once you have everything just the way you want it. There are other things as well. But overall, it delivers an incredible array of capabilities and unequaled  image quality for an APS-C sensor that has to be seen to be believed. With good lenses, that can translate into superior photos in most conditions.  How does it compare to the 5n?  Honestly for people shots, and especially for shots indoors at night in natural light, the 5n is just as good or better.(My favorite professional reviewers are DPreview.com. Their tests showed that the 5n is better in low light, but if they resampled the 5n image up to 24 mp then the images were equal. This is stupid. They had to downgrade the 5n image to make it equal the 7.) The extra pixels are just not needed and they do reduce low light sensitivity. But in low light both are better than my Nikon D7000 which honestly, I still love and will also use. (The nikon has a quality usable flash.)  At half the price for the camera plus the kit lens, the 5n is definitely a better value than the Nex 7 for all but the true enthusiast.  Only with the purchase of expensive extra glass, and a lot of testing and practice, will the potential better photo qualities emerge. But when they do the results are stunning to a discerning eye.  Now after two months, I would add the following: This camera is even better than I thought, I think in part due to the 18-200 lens being just superb.  All my shots are better than all my shots were before.  After figuring out the three wheel system and using it, it is fast and convenient. Need to be careful not to bump a wheel and change a setting by mistake.  One nice feature. When you set the camera the way you want it in program and aperture modes, then turn it off,  the settings are the same when you turn it back on.  I am not using my Nikon D7000 at all. I keep trying to find comparable shots where the Nikon will equal this camera.  No can do. In daylight, same picture, the Sony Nex 7 produces considerably better pictures. The detail is sharper, and when you learn to use the dynamic range settings they are incredibly better so you get better detail in the light and in the shadows. The depth of field is greater than with the Nikon. The distortion controls are wonderful and are making my pictures better. The articulating screen makes it easy to compose your shot from low and high angles. With zoom and so many pixels it's easy to let camera movement destroy a shot.  So finding something to rest the camera against to take a shot always helps, and depending on the height of the object you use, the articulating screen makes it easier to compose your shot.  I just love this camera and I believe it is making my photographs better than they ever were.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "A delight to use", "Author": "Here and there", "ReviewID": "R2XXQ3MBVBV7OB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I managed to get my hands on one of these in Jan 2012, and believe me it was difficult.The body weighs very little without the battery or lens, which is as it should be. Put the weight into a great set of lenses. Place one of those great lenses on this camera, and I've tried the 18-55, 55-210 and zeiss 24, and the results are wonderful. Yes you can argue that at not so low iso ratings the 24 MP is noisy, but dial down the noise in post image processing (I shoot in raw format) and the results are superb.I find the viewfinder to be remarkably good, better than optical viewfinders as I really see what I will get, and every time I look through it I am stunned at the fidelity. After a great shot the result can look almost 3d, if you have preview one. No dancing dots have crossed my eye's path.I upgraded from the 5n, which lacked the viewfinder in particular. The difference in ergonomics and quality is worthwhile. Also worthwhile is the expensive  Zeiss 24 lens, and the 55-210. Both deliver excellent results.This range will keep building over time, so any lenses you buy will still be valuable for years. However lenses are also difficult to find these days, as are older Leica lenses which many have had success with.The best camera I've ever owned, and a delight to pick up, to carry on long treks and to use.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Top of the line, for now.", "Author": "Linh Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R316RGPPKN1GZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 2: The new firmware addresses one of the biggest requests: a much better bracketing function. No longer limited to the paltry +-0.7EV. Now we can go up to +-3EV which is good enough for most HDR purposes. About time!Update: I recently got hold of a Minolta 3600HS(D) flash for dirt cheap ($50 shipped) and it works wonderfully with the NEX-7. Metering TTL is perfect and my indoor photos look great with bounce flash. Of course, it's a bit big and will add some weight to your camera, but well worth it.An average review from an average Joe using a not-so-average camera.HARDWARE:The build is sexy. It screams quality. Magnesium alloy body makes it heavier and bigger than the previous NEXes, as expected, but it's a welcomed extra weight. I don't have small hands and always thought the NEX-5/5N, as nice as the form is, felt a little bit like a toy. So I definitely appreciate the NEX-7's new size and weight, something I can really wrap my fingers around.I think Sony have a pretty perfect layout, or at least one that really works. I'm sure you've heard all about the latest-and-greatest Electronic Viewfinder with its amazing high resolution, and the intuitive TriNavi 3-dial control. Yes, they work. I'm a big fan of the bright and sharp 3\" tiltable LCD screen, but I've always wanted a nice VF on my camera to better compose my shots and avoid the nasty glare out in the sunlight. This is my first time using an EVF, and it's a good first impression. The view is quite large, giving lots of room to include all the necessary info. There's a diopter for those with bad eyesight. The eyepiece is not exactly glass-friendly, and is actually the one annoyance I have with the camera. I just can't seem to get it to comfortable situated in my eye socket. But maybe I just have to get used to a VF.The TriNavi is also very good (though i wish we can really customize the wheels). I mainly shoot with Aperture-priority mode so one dial is for aperture and one is for Exposure Value compensation. This does work very well, if you use a native E-mount lens. However, if you're like me and shoot using legacy lenses, you'll find that the Aperture dial is basically useless. I'd love to be able to customize the dials to my liking instead of the given presets. It's definitely not a problem, but I just feel that it's wasteful. Same with other manual modes.Oh, hey, there's a built-in flash and a Sony/Minolta hot-shoe as well if you're into that sort of things ;)IMAGE QUALITY:24MP on an APS-C sensor is pretty impressive. It has been pitted against the 16MP sensor time and time again, and proven to be slightly, VERY VERY slightly, inferior at high ISO settings so I won't bore you with that. But what does it mean for us average Joes? It means that you don't have to worry about anything. The 24MP sensor can hold its own. Image quality from ISO100-800 is pretty awesome. Noise at a minimal level and you can go right ahead with those huge prints. Noise level increases as you go past ISO 1600, but even up till ISO 3200, photos are still very much usable. I shoot a lot of indoor shots without flash and I like what I see. But of course, stick to lower ISO and/or use flash to get the best quality.24MP is also 6MP more than the cheaper NEX models. Will those extra pixels make a difference? I say definitely. a) Holy crop! So much headroom to spare, you can crop to your heart's content and still have a high-res result. b) Details. The 24MP sensor can probably (probably?) out-resolve any lens you have. I feel (placebo?) like my shots have that extra POP it didn't with the NEX-5, using the same lens.OTHER THOUGHTS:The NEX system is young, and far from developed. There's a lack of lenses (but an abundance in whining users...). Sony have done a decent job at covering all the focal ranges. We have the 16mm, 18-55mm, 30mm macro, 50mm, 55-210mm, 18-200mm (so good we get it TWICE!). Yet, we're still missing those fast and good lenses. SOme people say we need pancake primes. I say we just need primes. What's the obsession with pancakes anyway? The only good thing about them is the syrup.Also, you can't use the built-in flash as a wireless flash commander. What's up with that Sony? The A77 can do it. However, you can tilt the built-in flash upwards to bounce the light. Very convenient.CONCLUSION:Buy this camera if you can afford it and find it. It's a great performer in a small body despite the minor flaws. I think Sony have another winner.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb images, flawed interface. NEX 5n is a better choice.", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "R135AKIV55X0ZN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a review of my new NEX-7, a lovely, precision made piece of pocket magic. I hope Amazon readers will indulge me if I first make a few observations about the great Sony Corporation, and then some thoughts about the future of of digital cameras in the age of the iPhone.I have a longtime fondness for Sony dating from the 1970's when my job required constant international travel. This was before personal computers and the internet; I depended on my Sony Walkman, my Sony microcassette recorder, my Sony shortwave radios, and all the other jewels of miniature electronics Sony produced in those days with imagination and precision. Trinitron. The U-Matic 3/4\" video players we used for education and training before Betamax and VHS. Unfortunately in recent decades Sony has not stayed on the leading edge of consumer electronics. The company grew large and subdivided, replacing a strong sense of design coherence led by Akio Morita, with management by committee. The secret of Apple, and the reason Apple surpassed Sony, is mainly that one individual, Steve Jobs, maintained a coherent personal vision of product rightness over a long period of time and a variety of platforms. Sony on the other hand divided into a conglomerate of disconnected businesses. For example, unlike Apple, Sony's foray into the content industry (movies, music) did not really feed back to enhance their hardware products. There is not one Sony company but several; the people who make the new Sony Tablet P or the Bloggie MP4 recorders probably have never met the camera team. The CEO of Sony in recent years, Howard Stringer, was not a digital visionary but a clueless corporate \"Mister Businessman.\" As I write this Sony has lost billions for eight years and has just announced 10,000 more layoffs. The new CEO says his focus will be \"One Sony.\" I hope so because the disconnects within the Sony group are evident in this NEX 7; it is excellent photographically but lacks integration in other important ways.Sony was an early player in digital cameras and has remained strong, unlike their losing battle to stay in the television market or the MP3 market. In 2006 they committed to full-on competition with Canon and Nikon by buying out the Konica-Minolta line. Their DSLRs are first rate and they are the first to offer translucent non-moving mirror SLR's. Now with the NEX line of mirrorless, large sensor cameras, Sony has a hit and is hoping to lead the next phase of consumer photography. Or rather I should say, of ENTHUSIAST photography since as we all know, mass market photography today is increasingly dominated by the smartphone / iPhone with a vast array of third party software apps. More about that later. However, design by committee is evident in the Sony NEX 7; it gives the feeling that the features marked for incorporation came from a show of hands in a giant meeting rather than a unified concept. In sensors, Sony is pretty much the best in the world. Ditto for their marvelous manufacturing. But in user interface, in image processing and compression, in viewfinders, in lenses, in connectivity, wireless, software, in overall system architecture - they are uneven. Moreover, the camera group seems stuck in a past where cameras were in a silo by themselves. How sad that they seem unable to pull together Sony's amazing range of corporate skills in wireless, computers, etc., to focus them all on any one product.OK, that's my history essay. Thanks for reading. Now on to testing the NEX 7. After having mine on backorder at Amazon for EIGHT MONTHS, it finally arrived a few days ago. I was also fortunate to capture one of the Zeiss 24mm NEX E-mount lenses, a gem (except it is overpriced and lacks image stabilization). I made a direct comparison with my Nikon D7000 for basic image quality and evaluated the other features as best I could, without yet having read every page of the 211 page (!) manual. There are three basics of digital photography: 1) image quality including JPEG efficiency, 2) handling quality including size, weight, speed, and ease of use and 3) connectivity, networking, and special techniques. I am leaving out cost; if that is your metric, I can tell you right now that you can buy a very good digital camera which will produce excellent photos for about one seventh what I spent for this baby with the Zeiss lens.1. Image quality. I compared indoor both RAW and JPEG images from the NEX 7, 24 MP with my Nikon D7000, 16 MP. They certainly should be comparable since Nikon in fact uses a Sony sensor similar to that in the NEX 5n. I did this at ISO 100, 800 and 3200, trying to match the lenses between the two as comparably as I could, prime for prime, zoom for zoom. The results were mixed. With RAW images, the Nikon D7000 had a slight but definite edge, with more contrast and smoothness, especially in the shadows. (This implies the NEX 5n sensor may also be better than 7 at high ISO.) But with JPEGs it was the other way; at both high and low ISO, the NEX-7 images were distinctly superior to the Nikon in clarity and punch. The difference was greatest at ISO 3200. So it seems when JPEG compression is brought in, the Sony boys have a slight edge in the fine details of their algorithm for image compression. The differences are subtle; let's call it even. The NEX 7 produces beautiful, sharp, dynamic photos, really nice, and every bit as good as the best half-frame DSLR. So far so good.2. Handling. So if the image quality is top grade, and the slim NEX 7 is so much lighter and smaller than my top of the line Nikon half-frame DSLR, and I am much more likely to take it with me when I travel, does it mean I'm ready to switch over completely? No, I'm not. For one thing, I have been shooting Nikon SLR's since John F. Kennedy was president. Nothing feels as comfortable and natural to me as having that funny clacking box held up to my eye, allowing me to see exactly what the lens will see. The NEX 7 comes with an EVF (electronic viewfinder) which means a little television you squint at through a lens as if it were a real viewfinder. This has been touted as a great advance but I find I don't like it. For one thing, the EVF display - in spite of being a state of the art 2.4MP OLED - is rough compared to a real life image. The picture has sparklies and the colors are off, and the proximity feature (viewfinder doesn't turn itself on until your eye is near the camera, to save battery) is disconcerting. And the information there is simply a duplicate of what can be seen on the much nicer, big LCD on the back, which has a handy tilt mount. With the LCD one can watch as the exposure is adjusted and see the changes in real time, which doesn't work so well using the EVF. The big display also helps more with focus; there is a digital zoom and a Sony feature called \"focus peaking,\" visible color marking of the in-focus area that allows fine manual focus. This is my favorite feature and makes it much easier to use manual lenses from Pentax / Leica / Canon. This electronic assist for manual focus, which is also on the 5n, is one of the best reasons for buying a NEX.3. Features and connectivity. The NEX 7 offers approximately 50 settings, ranging from gimmicks I am unlikely to ever use (camera fires the shutter when it detects a smile - will this work with my dog?) to those I use constantly (exposure comp, ISO, white balance) to those which sound intriguing but will need trying out to see if they really work (HDR, dynamic range). This all could have been organized more simply and some of the choices are head scratchers. For example: white balance and meter mode appear under the Brightness/Color menu, not the Camera menu nor the Settings menu. There are many such illogical, confusing choices. For example, there are an interesting set of \"picture effects\" which can emphasize one color, etc. These effects are fun to play with; I have uploaded a sample on the product page which picks out the reds in my neighbor's barn. But if I next want to try picking out the yellows in the scene rather than the reds, I must push or twist no fewer than six buttons and wheels, going back through the menus tediously to start over again with the next Picture Effect. Also, since there is no way to go backwards on these effects to the unaltered image, skilled photographers (the ones who would buy the NEX 7 in the first place) will prefer to apply effects like these in postprocessing rather than in the camera. So this entire feature set is more gimmick than useful. In general, the user definable wheels and buttons on the NEX only whetted my appetite for even more programmability. It would be much better if the camera would allow me to set up ALL my own menus the way that makes sense to me - for example gathering all the rarely used items in one menu so as to reduce clutter, and then another menu with a short list of items I use frequently. Instead, I'm left trying to figure out the obscure choices made for me by a Sony engineer sitting in a cubicle in Tokyo. Also, it is evident Sony did not try out the prototype on enough users before freezing the design. For example, a dedicated movie shutter button is placed where it is vulnerable to being pushed by accident, resulting in frequent unintended movie recordings, which must then be reversed through a nest of menus. This may sound minor but in fact is so irritating I may have to tape a piece of cardboard over the button. Numerous other reviewers have complained about this; it is a mistake and should have been caught before product release. And why do we need a separate shutter button for movies anyway? Other notes: Battery life is short compared to pocket cameras, especially when the EVF is on. Autofocus is a bit slow. Connectivity should have been higher on the list. No wireless, no GPS, and no ability to communicate with computer or phone except by ordinary USB download. Finally, there is a huge missing feature; after setting the 50 options, there is no way to SAVE the configuration. If you are not sure you remember what you set, your only choices are to go through all the menus again, which is tedious, or else 'reset all' in which case you must start from scratch next time.Lens choices are an issue for such an expensive \"pro quality\" body. Available e-mount Sony lenses are mostly not up to the body in quality. The 18-55mm kit lens has a plastic lens barrel. It is also hard to understand why Sony chose to develop a new e-mount at all instead of simply using their established alpha-mount with its large existing lens portfolio. Apparently this was for lens compatibility with their video camcorders, but that has no relevance for me. There will be more lenses to come; Sony appears to have been somewhat taken aback by the success of the NEX series and is scrambling to catch up. In the meantime, it's a significant plus that numerous accessory mount adapters are available for non-Sony lenses, even old manual lenses from the 1970's - many photographers are buying NEX 3, 5 or 7 for this reason alone.Summary: I am having a delightful time playing with the NEX 7 - but then I'm a gadget lover as well as a photographer. I enjoy the soft snickety-snick of the focal plane shutter. It's a sweet, complex toy and lots of fun, and a worthy successor to the Sony marvels of decades past. Build quality, an area where Sony is unsurpassed, is refined and precise. It produces images as least as good and in some cases better than my big, heavy Nikon DSLR, but is much lighter and smaller. It does not feel as natural to hold as an SLR, but it's going to be around my neck more of the time, and you can't take a picture unless you have your camera. The problem with the NEX is that the architecture does not feel as if it came from the mind of a single inspired designer. Rather there is a \"pile of features,\" some brilliant and some gimmicky. I don't think the new wave of NEX type mirrorless cameras make DSLR's obsolete quite yet. Perhaps we would one days see a full frame camera similar to the NEX? One which would be designed from the get-go to make full use of the tens of millions of legacy full frame Nikon / Canon / Pentax / Leica lenses out there?Overall, I'm a bit disappointed in Sony. I wish the NEX 7 could have been a breakthrough in user programmability, wireless connectivity, and interface design to go along with the innovative mirrorless mechanicals - but it is not. It adds more photographic capability only in conventional terms; bigger sensor, more pixels, smaller box, more features. Yes, there are more user choices for the buttons and wheels than usual but for the most part, the interface is like other cameras, only more so. And there are too many details to learn. The very fact of needing a 211 page manual shows it is too complicated. At this point in photographic history, conventional digital cameras are hitting a wall. As smartphones come with better and better internal cameras (the 8MP sensor on my iPhone 4S is as good as my digicam from a few years ago), the devices identified primarily as cameras need to meet them from the other direction, becoming more like cell phones. All portable devices these days should have wireless connectivity, it's a no-brainer. And what if the NEX 7 allowed for third party apps? The first brand to break out of the 'camera' silo and offer a programmable high end photography solution will be a true breakthrough. NEX 7, for all its niceness and precision, is not that breakthrough.Conclusion: It is difficult to recommend the NEX 7 given its slightly uneven design, flaws in the interface, expanded size, high price and paucity of quality lenses. Its big feature is the EVF which I did not find to my liking. It seems to me the Sony NEX 5n is the sweet spot of the NEX line. It has most of the best features of the NEX 7 for about half the price. The EVF is optional as an accessory for the 5n. And it's smaller and lighter weight and has slightly less digital noise than the 7 at high ISO due to fewer megapixels. The touch screen on the 5n is also useful. And you may not need to use your whole vacation to read the 5n manual - it only has 82 pages.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sports and General Photography with the NEX-7 (Rolling Review Style)", "Author": "Matthew Durr \"Amazon Connoisseur\"", "ReviewID": "R1XFXYU81UM6YK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Warning: This review is LONG. You may want to set aside time to read it. All pictures mentioned should be under the product pictures for this camera.Let me start out by saying I'm new to photography. Not new in the sense that I don't know how to generally operate a camera, but concepts such as equalizing the exposure pyramid, composition, and \"seeing the focal length\" are areas that I have really just delved into. Just for a bit of scope, before getting this camera, I was shooting a Nikon d300 with the glass talked about in detail below, for only 2 months. Before that, point-and-shoots. A very big leap in equipment from basic consumer to enthusiast. So why did I get into this so fast?  Simple--demand.  My college's sports department needed a cheaper alternative for season games to get action shots, as they couldn't afford the resident pro photographer for every game. At the time, I was shooting a borrowed Nikon d40 for our newspaper. I wanted to give it a shot, and very quickly found that it wouldn't cut it for a sports camera, especially for indoor basketball games. After trying a couple different old lenses that my father no longer needed, such as the Tokina 80-200 f/2.8 AT-X, I ended up loaning out his trusty d300. It got the job done, but was limited by my complete lack of large aperture autofocus lenses, as the simple focus confirmation dot paired with the optical viewfinder weren't accurate enough for reliable results.  After what seemed like enough research to write a dissertation, I came to the conclusion that I'd be better off actually investing in a body to use the glass I already had, rather than get better glass for a still great, but 5 year old camera. This fell onto the camera up for review today, and after falling victim to the same shortage many other photographers had to wait through, I have finally had a chance to see what the hype is all about.  First day:  Luckily for me, my Nikon F mount to E mount adapter came in the same day as the camera, and after the very long, 5-hour, initial battery charge...ran out of usable light outside to take any usable photos.  I did, however, have ample time to take a few pictures with the main lenses I use with it, as well as a size comparison between the d300 and a point-and-shoot. You can see these in the product pictures.  Spoiler ahead: the size comparison picture I have attached demonstrates the point that Sony got it right and managed to pack in almost every single feature a DSLR has, remove the reflex mirror, and keep the whole package about the size of a normal compact camera. This is no small feat.  As far as first impressions about the camera itself, it just /feels/ right. Great rubberized grip, great weight, solid all metal build, and everything has a defined edge \"cut\" that really makes the design of this stand out when in the hand.Second/Third Day:  So, enter again a couple days later, after I've really gotten a chance to mess around with the camera, and my first impressions about the general feel were backed up by the image quality. Outstanding. Rich. Detailed. Those are the three words that come to mind every time I ask myself how to feel about the NEX-7's RAW files (I strive to only shoot RAW for maximum post processing flexibility) at low ISO's. Seeing as it is March, the flowers are out, so take a quick look at my boring flower shot and get back here. Good? Now check out the one with the robin taken with the 300mm f/2.8. Alright? Awesome, we can move on.  So one thing I really wanted to test with this camera that is a hard quality to quantify is the usability, how it shoots, how it operates, and how it just feels as a quality piece of kit. Well there's good news, and bad news. Good news is, its highly customizable and modular control interface allows me to have complete and total control over my exposures. With the live exposure feedback on both the LCD screen and EVF, I know exactly what the picture will look like /before/ I take it, (constant DoF preview, for instance), something an optical viewfinder can never do. The bad news, however, which is really just niggling here, is that in order to get your preferred settings where you want, you have to play with the camera for a good few hours straight, wading through the honestly awful menu structure. I won't lie, it is disorganized and laid out terribly. That said, with the exception of formatting the memory card, I have assigned all the settings I ever need to on-body (and out of menu) controls, so my trips to the menu will be very few and far in between. If you worry about this point, rest easy, once you fiddle around and get everything assigned to the button of your choice, you'll be good to go.  A quick praise and redux of the EVF/LCD screen with peaking and manual focus assist: for still subjects, the combination of the two leads to extremely precise focusing that is amazingly useful for lenses, such as the two I use, that have a large maximum aperture. When you start focusing, you can actually see a band of color (can choose from Red, Yellow, or White, I use yellow on high intensity) move along so you know when and where the focus will hit. Then, after your area is in \"color\", you use manual focus assist (I assigned it to the AF/MF-AEL button) to get even more precise focus. Now on moving subjects, just stick to peaking and hope for the best. Again, if you are using a large aperture (f/2.8 or larger), then typically what flashes in your peaking color will be in focus. Of course, if you have any prior experience with manual focusing, you'll be right at home here. In my case, these lenses are easier to use on the NEX-7 than they ever would on the d300. One thing to note about the EVF though, in moderately low to good light, it has very fast response, so much so that it is essentially real time, with no screen tearing like I was expecting. In low light, in order to show a decent image on screen, it has to turn the refresh rate down, so it lags a tad. Just keep that in mind.Fourth Day:  I really wanted to put this camera through its paces today and went on a photo trip of sorts out to a local covered bridge. I wanted to find out more strengths, and possible new weaknesses. To keep it short and sweet, take a look at the \"one-shot HDR\" picture from inside the bridge and come back. Looking good, no? Anyways, onto a few quick strengths, with a light prime attached, this camera is just a piece of cake to carry around, angle, and shoot. Held mine for 2 hours straight without a neck strap (one of the weaknesses of this camera is that the included neck strap is truly awful) and simply changing hands when carrying it was the only remedy needed for taking the weight off. The tilting LCD helps you get up and close to focus without having to bend or crouch too much, and is bright enough to see in all but direct mid-day sunlight. One note about the EVF, though, the eyecup isn't quite deep enough to block out ALL outside light, but the chances of outside light creeping in is pretty small, and once you know where it's coming from, you can press the camera up to your eye in whatever angle you need to get it to be a complete seal.  So, fourth day impressions? Getting more and more comfortable with it, but take note, this is a camera that DEMANDS that you take it with you and shoot, as memorizing what your settings and buttons do takes a bit of time. For me, I'm already starting to intrinsically get this process down, and am starting to see what all the hype is about the controls. One side note, all I have with me is a slow class 4 card. When writing RAW files each file takes about 3 seconds, when I do a 3-4 shot burst, that time gets compounded. I have a fast (Sandisk UHS-1 95MB/s) card coming in hopefully tomorrow, and although the camera doesn't support it the UHS-1 class speed, it'll be a good, fast class 10 card to have if I ever get another future NEX that has UHS-1 support, OR a USB 3.0 card reader.First week round-up:  I have now had the chance to really get to know this camera over the past week. Here's just a quick roundup of pros and cons that I find relevant to shooting, some of which are mentioned above.Pros:1. 24MP sensor strikes the perfect balance between high resolution, ISO noise, file size, and dynamic range. Any camera I get from this point on needs to have at least this many megapixels, as the cropping flexibility is tremendous.2. Body design and function is great. The \"L\" shape creates a very secure grip, and the fact that it is rubberized just makes it grip that much more. Everything, save for the buttons and screen, is metal. There is nothing like the feeling of picking up a camera after a few hours to be greeted by a cold, hard, magnesium alloy body. Though it's not weather sealed, I'm sure this camera can take some punishment.3. The EVF has changed the way I shoot, coming from an OVF. Being able to \"see what the sensor sees\" is a true game changer. I will never go back to an OVF. It's not all peachy though, see cons.4. The peaking and focus magnification functions, combined with the bright tilt screen, have made getting numerous shots that I couldn't get with a DSLR (with manual lenses), possible. It's just amazing to zoom into 100% to get tack-sharp accurate focus in real time, even with large aperture lenses. It's even more fun to see the \"band\" of the depth of field get closer and further away as you play with the focus ring. :)5. Though I haven't done much video yet, the few little clips I have tried out are great. Seeing as I got this camera for PICTURES, the fact that it does any sort of video at all (let alone 1080/60p at 28 Mbps!!!) is like icing on top of red velvet cake. On a similar note, I have not once accidentally pushed the video record button, as many others complain about. Maybe I'm just lucky with the curvature of my thumb?6. With a fast card (in my case, a SanDisk Extreme Pro 32GB, SDHC, UHS-1 Flash Memory Card SDSDXPA-032G-X46,Black), camera operation is great. RAW files write fast, even after a large burst of 6-10 photos, and scrolling through photos and magnifying to check focus is a lot faster than a class 4 or 6 card.Cons:1. Though pixel-level detail with 24MP at ISO 100 in RAW is flat out amazing, viewing anything higher than ISO 400 reveals pixel-level noise. Not great if you're a pixel peeper. That said, at an IMAGE level, noise only really shows up at 3200, and is easily removable in post processing. Also, since I try to always use a large aperture prime, I can afford to always stay within ISO 100-400. No big deal here.2. The EVF struggles in high contrast situations to accurately show highlights and shadows, meaning it clips both of them. However, this doesn't affect the image upon immediate playback, and if you shoot in RAW, you really just need to make sure your subject is generally exposed right and you can mess with all the highlights and shadows quickly and easily in post. Also, though the refresh rate is truly real-time in moderately low to good light, when it gets really low, the screen rate is something like 10-15 fps, which is because the sensor needs to lower the \"virtual\" shutter rate so it can show a properly exposed viewfinder image. This is the case with ANY mirrorless camera.3. 24MP RAW files will quickly fill your hard drive. You better bet on getting a large external hard drive on down the road.4. The only native lens that outresolves the sensor is the Zeiss 24mm f/1.8. However, I have seen many amazing shots already from the Sony 50mm f/1.8 OSS, despite it technically not being up to snuff. That said, there are some great lenses in e-mount on Sony's roadmap for this year, and until then, if you are using any good manual full-frame lenses (such as mine, the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 AI-s E-series which is replacing the 50mm f/2 AI pictured in the product images, and the 300mm f/2.8 AI-s ED) they outresolve the sensor very well.Last installment of the rolling review, queue paid sports photography:If you have read this far, kudos to you. This will be the final post regarding the fast action performance of this camera.First, see the baseball and softball pictures posted in the product images. Now get back here! Can you tell those were caught with a manual focus lens?I didn't think so. There are 5 big things that this camera has over any other DSLR or mirrorless (in the same price range) in regards to sports photography (granted that you already have some proficiency with manual focus lenses). Let me explain:1. 10 fps full resolution with a 17 file (in RAW!!!) buffer depth. Though fps can never be high enough (even the D4's 12 fps would miss some of the action in baseball), I have never once locked myself up while shooting, being able to consistently fire off 3-7 shot bursts and go right to shooting another. Cameras like the Samsung NX200, for instance, have a fast burst mode, but a poor buffer depth, locking up often. When paired with a fast card (I was redundant as mentioned before and got the 32gb Sandisk Extreme Pro 95MB/s, maxing out probably at 25MB/s), this camera doesn't disappoint in pure operational speed.2. 24MP is absolutely huge. I've also said this before, but in this sort of situation what the resolution allows me to do is shoot first, compose later (in PP), and still maintain perfect amounts of detail. Going to around 50% crop? No problem! This sort of advantage gives me more time to get focus, instead of thinking of tightly framing a shot.3. Peaking and manual focus assist. For people running, and quick acquisition, use peaking. If you look where you should (the ground, not the players), just wait until the band of the depth of field gets to them, and snap away. You may not hit critical focus (especially at f/2.8!), but for a generally good shot, this works very well. When you have time to prefocus, such as on the player at bat, the pitcher, or various bases waiting for someone to steal, THAT'S where the genius of manual focus assist comes in, just zoom straight in with the press of a button and turn the ring until you see the fine sand detail. Using these in combination feels like it gets me to about 75% autofocus performance (not including the stupid fast sonic wave focus lenses), and frankly, that's great.4. Weight (lack-thereof). Though having a big lens attached to any camera makes a heavy set-up, in cases like this, with a 5.6 pound lens on a monopod, literally all the weight is in the lens, the camera is just an add-on. This has its own advantages. You can get by with a cheaper tripod built to hold less (I'm using a cheapo 14 clam Vivitar monopod, and no worries about it collapsing on me), and when carrying it around the field, the overall weight is negligible (after you take into account what you are carrying!).5. Price/Performance. This is the biggest point of them all. What all these factors combine to do, for the money, is staggering. To get the same quality of pictures with autofocus, would need a d400 (doesn't exist yet, but will probably have the same sensor as this camera) and the Nikon 300mm f/2.8 AF-S VR ED. I would probably have to get a better monopod for the extra weight as well. All in all an outfit like that would cost about $7000-$8000, that's not including any other accessories like a vertical grip, extra batteries, or even a capable memory card. My set-up? NEX-7+Nikon 300mm f/2.8 AI-s ED+Vivitar Monopod+Fotodiox Adapter+32gb SanDisk Extreme Pro? $1800. Is autofocus really worth $5000? For me, even if I had the money, and after seeing what my combination can do, I say no.So final thoughts? You can already see what my argument would be based on the major points above. There are so many more valid points I could make about the system to back up my claim, but I feel those are all I need.I'll say it right here and now, if you have any proficiency, or plan to acquire proficiency, with manual focus lenses, the NEX-7 with a capable ED telephoto Nikon or Canon lens is currently the best choice for a rising sports shooter on a limited budget. You'll mis-focus here and there with really fast moving targets, and will need a lot of practice to keep up with sports such as soccer and football (which I firmly believe will be doable), but there is no other camera/lens combination out there that gives a photographer this much performance for this little cost. Let your photos speak for you and get the jobs, not what your camera outfit looks like (I get nothing but stares when walking around with this thing). I showed my employer my pictures before I presented the camera, and got the job BECAUSE OF THE PICTURES.Now that I've written this, go ahead and get yourself an ED telephoto before the prices skyrocket too much on eBay if you have a NEX. :)This concludes my rolling review. I may on down the road in a few months update it. We'll see. My initial impression of a 5-star camera still stands extremely well.

I am an extreme pixel-peeper.  When focus was perfect, 7D + L-lenses created some stunning images but perfect focusing (to my satisfaction) was rarely achieved, less than 5% at best.  It was about the same with Nikon.  The problem is phase focus scheme in those DSLRs.  Because light travels in 2 different paths, one to focus sensor and one to image sensor, a perfectly focused image as seen by the focus sensor does not necessarily fall on the image sensor perfectly focused.  Color temperature of the light and chromatic aberration contributes greatly to this error.I admit, most people will not be bothered by this but it bothered me.  I want to see that perfectly focused pixel level sharpness when viewed at 100%.  The only way to achieve this is to let the image sensor control lens focusing, i.e. contrast focus as implemented in mirror-less designs.After selling off all my expensive DSLR gear, I now have Sony NEX-7 with Zeiss 24mm f/1.8 and 50mm f/1.8.  The picture quality is just jaw-dropping as others have reported.  What I am most happy about is near 100% focus accuracy.  It's so consistently great.  Ok, it's not ideal for shooting fast moving objects but for portraits and shooting stationary objects, I have never used anything better.The Zeiss 24 is over-priced but it is certainly more than good enough to be mated to the NEX-7.  The 50mm f/1.8 is also amazingly sharp and will please all the pixel peepers out there.  The menu structure, the lack of custom setting storage, and that video record button that everyone hits unintentionally, are the only bad things I can think of.  After years of frustration with Canon/Nikon DSLRs, I am finally happy.  All I need is a long telephoto lens (300mm, f/2.8) and that means manual focusing at this time.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nex-7 with the Zeiss 24mm: A joy to use & Marvelous image quality", "Author": "KaraKartal", "ReviewID": "R3OQIXTSJFUTB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love It, Love It, Love It :) Best camera I've owned/used so far. Image quality is marvelous especially with that precious Zeiss 24mm lens. But more importantly it is a joy to use. You just need to use it for a few days to understand how fun it is to use this camera. Handling, ease of use, highly configurable buttons, the beloved tri-navi, its size and look, build quality...all of these things make it a very fun camera to use and carry around. One negative thing though is that it is quite addictive. You will want to take it everywhere and shoot with it all the time :)  Oh and also if you are thinking about buying this camera as opposed to a DSLR so that you can shoot unnoticed well you will be a' little disappointed because the thing looks way too sexy with the Zeiss lens and it does attract people's attention in a positive way :) So, people could still come to you and ask what you are shooting with. It happened to me, so I am speaking from personal experience.Now let's go into a' little bit more detail. The tri-navi works really well and makes it very easy to shoot manual. The menu system is a little poorly designed but this won't be an issue cause if you spend some time configuring the extra buttons on the camera then you won't have to go into the menu 99% of the time. One complaint from other users for the Nex 7 is the lack of good quality lenses. I got the Nex-7 with the kit lens. On top of it I got the Zeiss 24mm and 50mm (f1.8). I got the kit lens because I never shot with a prime before and I was scared that using a prime might be too challenging to shoot a toddler since they move around a'lot. But I was wrong. I totally love both of these primes. I love them so much that I have not even attached the kit lens even for testing yet. I use the 24mm as a walk-around lens. It's on my Nex 90% of the time. And when I want to shoot close-up portrait shots I switch to the 50mm prime. Both of them are really top quality primes. For the way I shoot these two primes are enough for 90% of my needs. And also if you check the Sony lens roadmap there is an E-Mount G series (high performance) zoom coming toward the end of the year. So, those of you who are hesitant cause there isn't a good quality high performance zoom should not be discouraged from buying this camera cause Sony will be coming out with one sometime this year. I read that auto-focus is fast during normal light but a' little slow or average in low light. This may be true for the kit lens (I haven't tested it yet so I can't confirm) but from my experience it is not true for the Zeiss. Stepped down to 1.8 and ISO up to 1600 the camera takes really good pictures in low light and for me the auto-focus did not struggle. I was able to take very clean in-door night (low light) shots of my toddler with the Zeiss lens (f set to 1.8 and ISO 1600 and no flash). The shots at these settings were very clean. If a camera can catch a toddler with low in-door lighting during night then it can catch anything :) I totally did not need any flash and auto-focus was fast enough for my low-light needs.Overall I would highly recommend this camera. Sony's managed to come up with a game-changer with the Nex-7. It is a revolutionary camera just like how the 5d was for Canon.

Just as I was recording him doing a solo, the camera told me it was overheating, and it shut down.No warning.  It re-booted, and was functioning about 30 seconds later, but I'll never get that moment back.What burns me is that I hadn't been recording all that long -- I'd done about 6 minutes of their first song, and we were about 4 minutes into the second song, when it shut down.I went to Sony's website, ready to pen an angry email demanding they address this obvious defect.  But then I discovered that this is not a defect, according to Sony. It's simply life with your NEX-7.I discovered a document on their website under the title \"The camera turns off by itself after recording movies for a short amount of time.\"  It says that recording hi-def movies with an APS-C size image sensor requires a large amount of power, which can cause the internal temperature to rise to the point that the camera shuts down.Their solution:1) avoid exposing the camera to direct sunlight2) turn off the power when the camera is not in use3) use a tripod if possible, and set SteadyShot to Off.I really wish I had known all this before I spent a lot of money on my NEX-7 and two expensive lenses from Sony.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "More than expected.

BUY IT NOW", "Author": "Uncle J", "ReviewID": "R11CNT4XUT04RO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My guess is that you are reading this as part of your research on whether or not buying the NEX-7. Stop reading and just buy it. It took me about 8 months to pull the trigger and I am so happy that I did, yet I wish I had done it earlier.Why buy it? if you are like me, an enthusiast with a passion for photography, high quality images, and a need for portability, then this is your toy. I am actually a camera junkie, I have a Canon 5Dmk3 with an array of lenses (which cleaned up my savings account) and although I love that camera, I found my self carrying way too much weight around to get a nice photograph. So I started looking at the NEX line of cameras last year when the 5N came out, then the NEX-7 was listed as camera-of-the year on Popular Photography magazine, and I just somehow knew that it was the camera I needed for traveling light and in style while catching great quality shots.So fast forward to a month ago when I finally got my NEX-7, I went on a cruise vacation with my kids, and the camera was everything I needed AND MORE. I was able to get off the boat and carry the camera using the shoulder strap, the camera looks VERY stylish and it is really light. But the best part: Image quality of the pictures is just insane, in low light, under the sun, using the color features, using HDR, this thing is just too much fun to use, pictures are crisp sharp in good light, little to no noise in low light, the kit lens rocks, and, the main reason why I got it: it fits in any backpack or strapped on my neck/shoulder. After we came back from the cruise I looked at the pictures on a 35' screen monitor and they look GREAT!I then started to do side by side comparisons with my 5Dmk3 (at home) using the same focal length/aperture/shutter/ISO, and.... Yes, the 5Dmk3 (using the 24-105 F4L lens) does much better in low light at high ISOs, but the rest of the pictures were near identical. I am surprised at the high quality of the NEX-7's kit lens compared to Canon's L lens! I know that most would say that there is no way to compare these two as they are two very different cameras at different levels with different 'purposes', and that may be true, still, image quality is quite comparable for a camera that costs a third of my 5Dmk3.I will keep my 5Dmk3 for my precious shots, studio photographs, when I need a special lens, and when I have enough space to carry it around making photography my only objective for the day. But when I want to travel, be light, be able to carry other things, pay attention to my kids, and still demand high quality images, my NEX-7 is the ONE.So is there anything bad about the camera?... well, I don't let any of the following bother me, but do consider:1-The flash sucks, you will need to get a flash for the hot-shoe to do decent flash photography, but again that is NOT what I use the NEX-7 for.2-The EVF is great, but an optical view finder leaves it in the dust.3-Camera is a bit slow to start-up (compared to other DSLRs) which may affect catching that perfect moment*****UPDATE: JUN 2013*****After well over a year of using the camera, I started to feel a bit disillusioned by it, I don't know why but the images I was getting were missing something, I don't how to explain it. So in an impulse I sold this NEX-7 on Amazon and got the NEX-6 for all of its new features and WiFi capabilities. The NEX-6 is a great camera just like the NEX-7, but still did not convince me. I ended up getting an OM-D and am very happy with it.So you are probably thinking: is this still a 5 star review even though I got rid of the camera? YES.

Only 7 years ago I decided to go digital with a Canon EOS30D and never looked back. I'm in no way a \"pro\" by definition, but I do know what I want to do and what \"tools\" to achieve them with. Fast forward to the NEX-7. What a piece of technology! First things first: This is not a camera you want to \"upgrade\" to if you come from a point-n-shoot background or basic DSLR's. Smaller, compact and radical menu designs will quickly frustrate even the most seasoned pro DSLR users. But if you take the time to learn about it, just like how you would learn going from film to digital, it is a VERY powerful camera. With respect to other reviewers on this site the Tri-Nav system IS highly \"customizable\" [Gary L. Friedman covers this in his NEX-7 ebook].I had rented it from our local camera shop [with the kit 18-55mm] to try it out. At first I was totally unimpressed and brought it back. The clerk offered me the Zeiss F1.8 to try with the NEX-7. What a night & day difference! YES! to take advantage of the Sony sensor you NEED quality glass to compliment it. So I bought the body only and purchased the Zeiss F1.8 & a Tamron Zoom lens [for traveling]. My passion for photography is ignited again and I'm excited to build a system about the NEX. Yes, there are limitations right now because there are not a lot of accessories and lenses for the NEX system. Sony has always been slow in that regard. But, I also purchased an adaptor to use my older Canon lenses [unfortunately, manual F-stop and focus] and am able to get those shots I so desire. OK, so pros & cons for me:PROS1) Compact body LOADED with features.2) Electronic View Finder [EVF] is a big game changer enabling me to \"see\" what the sensor sees.3) Tilt-screen lets me get those overhead shots or low to the ground POV scenes that I like for street photography.4) With fast SD cards I can get action shots in RAW at about 4 to 7fps depending on the scene. I get 10 to 12fps with JPG.5) \"Peeking\" focus assist helps with the telephoto shots6) FAST startup and responsive controls. You hardly ever miss any shots you want to take.7) LIVE VIEW mode is maintained through continuous shooting up to about 5fps8) All the data overlays on the live view screen helps set up shots.9) Low light shots are/at equal to the DSLR 'cousins'.10) and, of course, the Image Quality is the best! [with good glass!]. Pixel peepers may even find it hard to fault the images.CONS1) There is no way at this time [firmware?] to save different shoot settings like the way DSLRs cans save 2 or 3 settings. So unless you are in iA mode you have to think about every shot you do. This is one reason why point-n-shoot upgraders WILL get frustrated with this camera.2) Auto ISO is only limited to 1600 max.3) Auto Bracketing is limited [+/- 0.7 is not a lot to work with]*note firmware 1.01 now adds ev +3 or -3 with 3 shots auto.4) Battery life sucks so I have auto off feature ON and I carry a spare battery. With the fast startup I won't miss much.5) The hot-shoe is Sony proprietary so unless you have an adaptor it uses only Sony flashes and accessories.6) Pop-up flash will cast shadows on zoom lenses7) Not many good E-Lenses. . .

Wish it was Phase like the Sony DSLRs][FYI if you want to see what I use this with you are free to take a look at some of my pics: [...]]Movie Mode: I admit I have not used this feature a lot since I am mostly a stills photographer. But it works well enough. I did not take many movies with it, but I was impressed at the high-quality, the autofocusing, and the overall ease.Overall this is an amazing piece of technology coming from a film background. It does take some getting used to handling and using. I took the time to learn and found this easy to setup. Not as easy as it's bigger DSLR cousins, but easy enough for what it does. Sony has got a winner with the NEX. Can't wait to see what else is coming!", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally - a digital camera that's as fun to shoot as my Nikkormat!", "Author": "Del Simcox", "ReviewID": "R1HV5CIU0PRJZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for someone to make a camera like the NEX 7 for a long time. I purchased a Nikkormat about 45 years ago - and loved it. I was an early adopter of the Canon G series \"pro-sumer\" cameras and owned a couple of them. Now, with my new NEX 7, I have a camera that's a blend of both of these - and much better.The body of the NEX 7 is only a little larger than my Canon G-11 but feels solid like my Nikkormat. Designed into this little package is a lot of great engineering and extraordinary technology from Sony that work beautifully together.Here's what I like:A large APS-C sensor that produces astounding images with low noise.Well-thought-out controls that let me participate in taking pictures if I want - not just trip the shutter (although I can do that with the Intelligent Auto mode if I want)I really like the organization of the controls and menus on this camera. They are logical and accessible - more so than on my Canon G-11.The tilting LCD panel on the back is terrific. This is one of the features I liked on the Canon - but the implementation on the NEX 7 is so much better! I can shoot from my waist (like an old Rollei) or from the floor to get great pix of my grandkids, or by holding the camera as far above my head as I can reach to get a different perspective. The LCD accommodates all of these shooting modes with a large, bright LCD display.I like being able to use my old Nikkor lenses on this camera manually. With a Photodiox adapter, you can mate almost any legacy lens system to the NEX 7. Although you lose the ability for autofocus and automatically setting an aperture, you can do these tasks manually with ease. The NEX 7 will choose an appropriate shutter speed to provide a good exposure for the aperture you choose - since the NEX  7 previews the composition with the lens stopped down. And finally, here's a digital camera that provides a really usable manual focus capability!Whether you're using an old legacy lens, and focusing manually, or using a modern Sony E-Series lens with auto focusing, you can be the final judge on what's really in focus using a feature called Focus Peaking. Simply toggle on Manual Focus and turn the focus ring on the lens to see objects that are in focus highlighted with a contrast colored border. You can even \"zoom in\" X6 or X12 with the touch of a button to fine focus on the object of interest. This feature is beautifully implemented in the NEX 7 - and you can use it with the LCD or by looking thru the bright OLED viewfinder.Speaking of viewfinders, the NEX 7 viewfinder is really, really good. I use it a lot. Here's why:  Last year I had cataract surgery on both eyes. I didn't realize before this surgery that the new lenses the doctor put in can correct for near-sightedness and astigmatism. So when I got new lenses in my eyes, I was no longer dependent on glasses for distance vision. (I had worn glasses for 50 years!) Whoa - what a great gift! I'm still unable to see really well at close distances because of my age - so I need reading glasses. But that's not a big problem with this camera. Here's why:The NEX 7 assists me in two ways. First - the viewfinder has a diopter adjustment so I can dial in my correction and see clearly through the viewfinder without glasses. Second - the menus for the LCD display have a Large Font option so that I can actually see the information about f-stop, shutter speed, ISO, etc on the LCD without wearing my glasses. This is so exciting! Thank you Sony for thinking of us seniors!There are many other exciting features I could talk about like Sweep Panorama, Dynamic Range Optimization, built-in HDR and shooting at 10 frames per second - but that would spoil the surprise. You need to get your hands on one of these cameras and find out for yourself!One of the very best resources for getting acquainted with the NEX 7 is a series of YouTube videos done by Jon Adams of reflectedpixel.com. Jon is a professional photographer whose excitement about Sony's innovation and the NEX 7 is contagious. Search for reflectedpixel on YouTube and watch Jon demo the NEX 7 in a way that will inspire even a serious doubter.  But beware - if you watch, chances are you'll want to buy.I also like Gary Friedman's book \"Sony's NEX 7 Mirrorless Camera\" - available here on Amazon.com. I like the way Gary explains how to set the camera menus up for easy access to the most important features and the very best results.From the day I purchased my first digital camera - the 3 MP Canon G1 (at a cost of over 1 grand) - I wished for the day when a digital camera would arrive that felt like my Nikkormat in my hands, and took high-resolution pictures like I used to get with Ektachrome, and encouraged me to get involved again in the photo-making process using all of the wonderful benefits of the digital format.For me - that day has arrived with the Sony NEX 7.Update: 10/10/2012  I like carrying my NEX 7 on my belt - not hanging around my neck or in a backpack. I've discovered a couple of small, belt-compatible cases that I recommend. If you are using the NEX 7 with the kit 18-55mm lens, get the Tamrac 3320 case. It fits perfectly with the lens down. For a smaller profile, put on the SEL16F28 wide angle lens and use the Tamrac 5689 case. This is the same case I used to carry my Canon G-11 in - and it works well with the NEX 7 and SEL16F28. In this case, I take off the removable eye cup for the viewfinder. It will work with the eyecup installed, but it's a little too tight.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing performance, discreet family cam for photos and videos", "Author": "Wat", "ReviewID": "R16H0JC81P1V8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting with the Nex-7 for about two months now and it is easily in the top 3 cameras I've ever shot in terms of image quality. The only other two that beat it are full frame cameras so it's not a fair comparison.That said, I usually only shoot at the 12MP setting and it still delivers detailed images. For times I want to heavily crop or shooting in a challenging lighting situation I'll shoot RAW. RAW definitely shows what this camera can do. Mind boggling.The best part about this high powered image machine is that it is equally an amazing video camera. The 18-55mm kit lens focuses fast and SILENTLY and is optically stabilized for smoother video.The part that seals the deal for me is the size. This is great for family shots where having a discreet looking camera puts people at ease. It doesn't look like a paparazzi SLR. It's very elegant.You can get 24MP cameras for cheaper in the bulkier SLR style, but those have very few lenses that are silent for video and the ones that are out there are bigger and heavier than the cameras themselves. Pay a bit extra to get the best.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Captmatt", "ReviewID": "R1YFYZN6UL3QUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went from a Pentax K5 and Fuji X100 to this camera, the 18-55, 24, and 55-210mm, with the 50mm 1.8 on order. I also have a couple of adapters for manual lenses, mentioned just for background.The Sony Nex 7 is a fine camera, fast, almost great ergonomics (the poorly placed movie record button)and is capable of great results out of the box. I almost didn't get one because of all the internet pundits whining about the huge lenses and the electronic viewfinder. First, the lenses. The lenses are for the most part smaller than the equivalent Pentax lenses which are also an APS-C format, and Pentax has some of the smallest lenses, so I am not getting the whining about the \"big lenses\". I find them to be just the right size on the Nex 7 body, as they balance beautifully.I think smaller lenses on this body would decrease it's handling ability. Bottom line is the lenses are smaller than the APS C equivalents from other manufacturers. Yes the Pentax da limiteds are smaller, but the body there used on is thicker so there is a design difference between cameras. Need to compare apples and apples. The kit zoom and 55-210mm are superior to the Pentax equivalents, and the Nikon equivalents I used before. There not the greatest lenses in the world, but again compared to the competition they are either as good or better, plus their build quality is much nicer. The 24mm is in a league just below the newest Leica lenses, which is to say very good indeed. The Zeiss ZM lenses work great on this camera as well, as long as you use a retrofocus design you should have no problems with this camera, and the colors and sharpness certainly \"pop\" with the Zeiss lenses.The viewfinder is the best electronic viewfinder I have ever used, and is superior to optical viewfinders when using adapted lenses on the Nex. The viewfinder brightness changes with exposure settings, getting darker when underexposed and lighter with overexposure, and the focus peaking is fantastic. It is easier to use manual lenses on this camera than any manual camera ever made, period. And yes easier than a leica M.I also like the Panorama function on this camera, works much easier than the one on the X100. The white balance isn't as good as the X100, but is close. It is much better than the Pentax K5/7, which was one of the best.The only thing I am not fond of right now is the movie record button. I am hoping a firmware upgrade provides a disconnect for that button as it gets in the way too often. I haven't had the problem of the camera battery running down fast because of the eyepiece being activated as it swings around your neck, because I turn it off when not in use. It starts up so fast it is not a problem in use.The last \"problem\" that I am reading about on the internet is the \"poor corner\" performance. Sorry, not seeing it. I compared corners from my Pentax shots, with corners from my previous Nikon D7000 shots, with corners from my old Canon 5d mk 1 shots, and nothing about the Nex 7 corners are standing out as an obvious flaw. Again, I am not a professional, but I doubt there are many professionals lurking on internet web sites coming up with this stuff.If you are a professional photographer making a living with your camera, you may need more. It provides everything I need, and more, and I have been very happy with the results. I can put my whole kit in a small waist pack, and not feel the weight. I am satisfied with APS-C, and don't have the need for full frame, either size or costs. Could it be better, sure, add weather sealing, more lens choices, and a customer service department that actually provides any information in a timely manner.  Sounds like the lens choice is being addressed in the near future.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "The problem isn't the camera...", "Author": "David Siegfried", "ReviewID": "RBURI5NUED1P8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As the title of my review states, the problem isn't the camera itself, which is a tight and innovative piece of equipment with one of the best APS-C sensors to date. The compact size, image quality, and ease of use (once you get used to the radical design) is among the best of any camera made. The problem so far is the lack of high quality fast native e-mount autofocus lenses beyond the range of \"wide\" and \"normal\" focal lengths. I'm talking about a real portrait lens with a thin depth of field like an 85-90mm f/2 (equivalent to 135mm f/2.8 on full frame).There is a workaround for this; these types of mirrorless cameras support the use of just about any 35mm-type lens ever made since the 1960s with adapters. In most cases iris and focus control will be manual however, unless you use one of the Metabones adapters which supports aperture control and image stabilization. However the AF is unsatisfying with the Metabones adapter, being akin to the speed and performance in Live View mode.There is a reason that no native e-mount long and fast lenses are available and it's the dirty little secret of the whole mirrorless camera world and the reason that SLRs will probably never go away entirely: to produce a true portrait lens equivalent to say a Canon or Nikon 135mm f/2 lens would require a 90mm f/1.4 which would have about the same front element size as the big 135. The reason for this is that you can scale down cameras and sensors all you want but to achieve the same subject isolation (thin depth of field) at any one field of view the aperture opening has to remain the same. Thus you end up with a giant lens with a little camera hanging off the back like an appendage.This is why you usually see these mirrorless cameras paired with a wide or normal f/2.8 pancake lens which gives it that nice pocketable look. But even the slow 18-55 F/3.5-5.6 kit lens starts to look and feel out of proportion on this thin camera body, and that lens doesn't do justice to what this camera can do. I've been using this camera with the Metabones EF to NEX Speed Booster adapter, which allows me to use all my Canon lenses in their native full-frame glory. For instance, the Speed Booster almost magically turns my $350 50mm f/1.4 lens into a 35mm f/1.0 lens, so that the field of view and light collecting ability is essentially the same as when I use it on a Canon full-frame body. That in itself is pretty amazing, and the images are very nice, given the high dynamic range that this APS-C sensor delivers.The problem, though, is that using big lenses on this body feels awkward. This thing is designed for the little pancake lenses or the Sigma 30mm f2.8 DN Lens (Sony E) lens, which for $200 is the best value for the dollar in a \"normal\" e-mount lens. I'm an experimenter, and I don't mind having some fun matching a giant honking Canon lens to this camera for an afternoon of fun, but I can't see carrying around a bag of them to use on this camera. Even the best native AF E mount lens currently made, the Zeiss 24mm f/1.8, looks over-sized on this camera.This form factor is designed for sleekness and portability, and if you're into Street photography, this and the Sony E 20mm f/2.8 lens may be all you need. It is even more inconspicuous than a Panasonic GH2 or Olympus OM-D and has better image quality than those.My other main concern with this camera is the sensor overheating issue in video mode. This is potentially a great little movie making machine and I haven't pushed mine to see how far it will go, but many are reporting that the video shuts down after several minutes due to overheating. This pretty much shuts this out as even a B-roll option on a paid shoot. How can any camera company release a camera that offers video when the video is so unstable? This is just one more frustration in the search for the \"holy grail\" of DSLR video.5 stars for design and image quality but one star deducted each for the lack of proper fast lenses and the video issue.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "HDR and autoexposure bracketing users: Can not use self-timer or remote release with AEB", "Author": "Midwest Jim \"Midwwest Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R3GLFDA58C5H2T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sony's October 2012 firmware update finally expanded the NEX 7's autoexposure bracketing steps from an almost useless three exposures of +/- 0.3 or 0.7 EV's (or stops) to a more reasonable three exposures with up to +/- 3 EV's.Unfortunately (confirmed by Sony Support), Sony failed to also move the selection of autoexposure bracketing off the Drive menu.  This means you can not use either the self-timer or a remote shutter release with autoexposure bracketing!  They are mutually exclusive choices on the Drive menu.  The self-timer or a remote release is very desirable when bracketing because even with a tripod, touching the camera causes a small amount of movement. This makes subsequent post-processing high dynamic range or combining photos using masks less than perfect. While HDR software attempts to align the images, when feasible the best way is to use a tripod and not touch the camera when the images are recorded.Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Olympus etc. cameras for the advanced amateur/semi-/professional market permit using the self-timer or a remote release when doing autoexposure bracketing for just this reason.This limitation seems to apply to all the NEX cameras at present.  Sony thus perpetuates this limitation throughout the NEX line.  The NEX's own in-camera HDR function uses JPEG, not the RAW image format preferred for the best quality in post-processing.The NEX has so many desirable features for HDR and autoexposure bracketing - a rapid frame rate, a high resolution good dynamic range sensor, full control over exposure time/aperture/focus/ISO, and focus peaking.  With the Metabones adapter, Canon EOS lenses have full electronic aperture control, in-lens image stabilization, and just recently autofocusing (lens models after about 2006; autofocus is not as fast as on a Canon body).  The NEX 7 would be a wonderful relatively compact camera for HDR and landscapes except for this one software shortcoming.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "No limitations, no excuses.", "Author": "Carlgo", "ReviewID": "RQCS6MULXFJ46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are hundreds of reviews, including those by technical publications. I'll concentrate on things that may not be so apparent to a lot of people.This is a well-made camera with lots of attention to details that will make you appreciate it over time. It is not tiny or light, just much more compact than the typical DSLR.The most fabulous feature is its ability to use just about every lens ever made! That is astonishing. And it does it well with different ways to focus manual lenses. There is a multi-shot system that works to produce sharp photos with any lens in about any lighting condition. I even used an old Nikon telephoto that would only work with a tripod on the Nikon, but was even sharper hand held on the Nex!Non-Sony lenses are mounted by adapters that are available on Amazon and elsewhere. Most are fairly rudimentary little devices made in China under a hundred different brand names, but they work. One thing to consider is to use lenses that have a manual aperture control ring. Newer lenses were often made just for automatic cameras and you have to use adapters that have their own aperture control built in and these are not as nice to use.Those old lenses are coming out of the closet and off the shelves at camera stores where they have been gathering dust forever. The prices are going up, especially for the more revered models. In any case, the Nex-7 certainly makes tons of sense for anyone who has some nice old lenses languishing in the drawer.Be aware that wide angles made for rangefinder cameras often produce a magenta cast in the corners of this Nex. A lot of this is variable depending on subject and lighting, but it is causing much consternation for some people. There is a software solution (Cornerfix) and lenses made for SLRs do not have that problem, but they are bigger and require a longer adapter. Sony's published roadmap indicates that new Sony wide angles are on the way, so that would be a solution for many people.Also causing some complaining is the menu system. There are a lot of settings and it is a formidable task to dive in and find your way around. Sony gave this camera a number of knobs and buttons and a click wheel for direct access to menu sub-sets. And you can customize these settings to some extent to fit your needs. Still, there is no way but to jump in and practice and practice until you get it right.The battery drains pretty fast, especially when the proximity sensor turns it on when in a case or you accidentally hit the prominent video button. I highly suggest the outrageously priced Sony model as the aftermart batteries are worthless and maybe harmful to your device. I think a car charger would be very useful.THE NEX-7 DOES NOT COME WITH A MEMORY CARD. I got a Sony memory stick, only 8gb to start. I read a compelling argument that it is better to have several small ones than to put all your photos on one big one that might fail during an important assignment or on your bucket list vacation. Either the memory stick or a Class 10 will handle everything as fast as possible.BTW, a regular old USB cable downloads the camera quite fast with the memory stick at least, so no need for a card reader. Some people don't like their expensive cameras physically attached to a computer and I see their point.All the special tricks this camera does are done well. Panoramas, HDR, etc are all implemented very well.A wrist strap is just perfect with this camera. I'll promote Gordy.Sound is a big deal with video. At the ocean the wind noise was pretty bad, even with the setting for that activated. I hope to buy the little Sony mic someday.This camera has the large \"C\" sized sensor with nearly 25mps. When it came out there was much wailing and bitterness from the Noise People, those who do not think resolution is as important as the noise issue. As it turns out, noise is very much in control at anything like a normal ISO and with the technology you don't have to go to high ISOs anyway. Coming from a 6mp camera, I certainly see the vastly better resolution and appreciate it. My old Core 2 Duo computer still handles the files fairly well and I don't keep a high percentage of my shots, so haven't run into storage problems yet.Sony software is horrid, still considers Apple as an afterthought evidently. The manual, though, is excellent. I suggest downloading it to get an idea of how it all works.And one more thing about the lenses. Sony has been criticized because the E-mount lenses because they are big on the camera. They do incorporate motors and anti-shake mechanisms and are very light. Some of the size problem is that the camera is small by comparison. They are very attractive and modern looking I am just astonished at how sharp the 55-210 is. I just took a 100mm shot of a building hundreds of yards away, then blew that up to 100% and you can see the twirls in a little rope. Just amazing in combination with the Nex-7. Far beyond any system I have ever used.I think this is a wonderful camera that gives you every chance to make a great photograph or movie.

Also, you can finally disable the video button so no more accidental video clips. :)Now, the bad news.I really wanted to love this camera. Up until yesterday I have never had a problem with it overheating while taking video. Last night I had to shoot longer clips than I normally do because I wasn't sure when some of the action was going to happen. I did not shoot longer clips because I have no idea what I am doing and expect people to watch boring, unedited video clips.Right at the moment I was going to get some great shots, the camera shut down on me. NO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE LONGER THAN 3 MINUTE VIDEO CLIPS. IT WILL OVERHEAT AND SHUT DOWN. YOU MIGHT MISS ONCE IN A LIFETIME SHOTS. DONT RELY ON THIS CAMERA TO SHOOT VIDEO OF IMPORTANT EVENTS.I have been reading lots of reviews with people saying stuff like, long movies are boring. Why would you shoot long clips? Well, sometimes you have to shoot long clips to catch everything and THEN you edit it later. Please, stop making excuses for this camera. Overheating after 3 minutes is a serious limitation if you like to shoot video. Looks like I may go back to Panasonic and get the GH3 when it comes out. My GH2 never overheated and was not limited to 29.59 clips. The Nex7 is a nice stills camera but it is very frustrating if you need to shoot longer video clips.My original review is below....This camera has the potiential to be an amazing camera. They did so many things right and only a few things wrong. I love being able to get amazing picture quality without having to lug a brick around my neck all day.These are my observations after owning it for almost two months...These are things that need to be fixed.Video button needs to have an option to disable it (FIXED WITH FIRMWARE UPDATE), or make it a double press to activate it. It is too easy to hit it by mistake and then cause you to miss some shots because you don't realize it has been activated.Certain features require jpgs. The camera should automatically switch to jpg and then automatically switch back to your current setting.The back screen should be movable to any angle. (Like the Panasonic GH2)Jpg processing is not good. This needs to be addressed.The alignment grid should be available in different colors. Currently, it is black and is very hard to see when taking pics of darker subjects. I would love it had a red or yellow option.You should be able to save settings and quickly change to different shooting enviroments.Playback (for videos and pics) should be in the order they were taken. You shouldn't have to switch folders to view differnt file types. If they want to have different folders, they need to make it easier to switch folders. Perhaps, cycle through the different folders everytime you press the playback button.You should be able to set higher ISOs in smaller increments. It should not jump from 1600 to 3200 to 6400. If you need to use an ISO slightly higher than 1600 you should be able to set that and not have to jump all the way to 3200. (adding unwanted noise)Auto Panorama mode should be able to save a raw file and it should also let you pick the aperture.You should be able to save a default video setting. Very rarely do you want to use the same settings as still pics.Have a way for settings to transfer to Lightroom when you import them. Currently, they get tranferred with a generic setting. I am not sure if this is more of an Adobe or Sony problem.Video length is limited due to overheating. Sometimes limited to 3-5 minutes. Not good! My Panasonic Gh2 never overheated no matter how long the video was.FIXED WITH FIRMWARE UPDATE!!!!! Bracketing is too limited. -.7 and +.7? Really? It needs to be at least 2 stops over and under and also allow for more than 3 shots.Auto HDR should save as a raw file.Things they did right...Focus peaking! Love it! It is incredibly useful. Thank you!!View finder! Very nice! I wish the pics looked as good on my laptop screen! :)Size and weight! Love it.Configurable buttons. Very useful.Picture quality when using RAW. Amazing detail with a good lens.Kit lens isn't as bad as everyone says it is. (in real world use-not looking at test charts all day long)Movable focus area. Very useful. My 60d makes me chose on of the fixed focus locations. Not as useful.Harldy any shutter lag! Thank you.10 frames per second!

I didn\u2019t see any that had all the features I wanted all in one package besides this.  I needed a viewfinder that shows the actual photo, not just a clear glass hole like my old film point and shoot had.  Also I needed a flash that was integrated into it.  The Sony NEX 6 and 7 had both!I was biting my nails trying to figure out which one to get, so hopefully this review can help someone in my situation.First I bought the NEX-6 because I like the collapsible lens, but it's only 16 MP and also its kit lens (SELP1650) is ONLY electronic, even though you can adjust the ring manually with variable zooming speed and with the W/T single-speed zoom adjustment on the side of the lens body, there is still a delay when zooming and you can hear the motor going when you're shooting video.  I did try and used the WiFi ability, but that seems like a gimmick to me.  It\u2019s faster to open the battery door and take out the memory card and stick it into your computer.  Also the NEX 7 has a mic input and the NEX 6 doesn't.  The NEX 6 has this new Phase-detection circuitry, but I didn't notice it taking pictures faster with better autofocus, and I tried to move the camera to accomplish this.  I did try a Sony Alpha A77 and it seemed to autofocus faster than either NEX model.  Another irk, you have to press your fingertip a lot deeper into the body of the NEX 6 to make the flash pop up, where the NEX 7 is much easier.Video performance:I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I saw the video that was produced!  The integrated stereo mic takes really great audio recordings, without clipping unless under extremely loud conditions.  I took it to a bunch of concerts and it records more bass (at least down to 80hz by my guess) than I would think it would from \u201cjust\u201d an integrated mic.  For some reason, I have to record at 24p/24i, otherwise the audio track is slightly out of sync of the video, so I have to record at 60p/60i, or fix it in post production.  I am using firmware version 1.02.  Many users have noted that it\u2019s very easy to accidentally hit record on the NEX 7, and I\u2019m not exception!  I do it all the time.  With upgraded firmware, you can disable the record button, but I like it there and don\u2019t mind deleting files now and then.TIP:You can call Sony within the first month of owning a used model and buy a 2(?)-year drops and spills protection!  Also they offer extended parts and labor warranty, but not if it\u2019s dropped.  THEY TOLD ME ALL Sony cameras (NEW OR USED) from amazon.com have a 12 month warranty, starting when you bought it!  You can only get Squaretrade or Geek Squad for spills if you buy the camera new and not used, open box or refurbished.Beware:I clumsily dropped my camera onto the carpet from my lap while changing batteries or memory cards (you have to have the battery door off for both), and the battery door snapped off!  Tried to epoxy it, and that worked, until I bumped it again and it\u2019s still off.  The battery has a little blue holder inside the compartment and I just keep using it with it broken off.  So just close and lock it so that can\u2019t happen to you! NEX 6 vs NEX 7 kit lens comparison:So I decided to upgrade and now I have this NEX 7 with 24 MP!  The zoom on the kit lens for NEX 7 is silky-smooth.  They both use Sony's proprietary E-Mount system, so you'd have to use an adapter to use your Sony Alpha lenses.  I did notice that the collapsible SELP1650, on either the NEX 7 or NEX 6, has a little bit more of a reddish tint to it than the NEX 7's kit lens (SEL1855).  The NEX 7's kit lens is an 18-55mm zoom and the NEX 6's kit lens is 16-50; therefore the NEX 7's lens can zoom a little bit farther in, and the NEX 6 can zoom a little bit farther out.  I ended up keeping the NEX 6 kit lens and selling the body, because I liked the fact that it can fit in my pocket with the NEX 6 kit lens.  The NEX 7 kit lens is 7.10 oz, and the NEX 6 kit lens is 4.30 oz, with the NEX 7\u2019s body with battery and strap weighing 12.95oz.  It gets more and more noticeable the longer you shoot, and it\u2019s harder to use the NEX 7 with its kit lens as a point and shoot.I have shot over 3000 photos already and they are pretty good.  I took the same exact picture with the same settings, subject, lens and zoom with both the NEX 6 and NEX 7 and I had to zoom ALL THE WAY in to tell a difference, and even then it was VERY tough!  This is in JPEG\u2026I didn\u2019t think to try the test in RAW and now I don\u2019t have both anymore so I won\u2019t know.  You can see a lot of tests like that at DPREVIEW.COM.  They already did that, and with many different cameras, too.  I have taken many photos and basically both cameras can take very similar photos, but the NEX 7 is higher end, and you can feel it when you use it.  I like the sound of the shutter of the NEX 7 a little better, too.Hope this helps someone\u2026 I didn\u2019t plan on this long of a review but I got on a roll!  I will update if needed!", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "A daunting machine, but absolutely incredible", "Author": "Personal Robot", "ReviewID": "R2KZS75S9XXK4N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a pro and I don't have professional expectations of this camera. I know some do and that's fine, but I review this from the perspective of an enthusiastic and maybe slightly experimental everyday user who has something in mind for his photos. I don't just want pictures of the kids, I want to be able to take the *amazing* pictures that I find when I'm out and about that I've never been able to capture. This camera is more than capable of that, I just have to catch up to it. I learn something new every time I use it.Update (April 2, 2013): One of the handiest things I've found is to turn on Focus Peaking for manual focusing, which highlights the in-focus areas with a brightly colored outline (the color can be changed - I prefer yellow because it is extremely bright and instantly recognizable. I've also set focus to DMF, or Direct Manual Focus, which allows you to do some manual fine tuning of the focus after the camera has auto-focused with the lens' focus ring. I'm not in situations where I can manual-focus all the time, so having the ability to quickly tweak the sometimes-off auto-focus is pretty incredible.My search for a good strap ended, at least for now, with the OP/TECH USA Utility Strap - Sling (Black). This handy strap has a quick-release latch for the camera, so only one short strap remains on the right side of the body which snaps into a free-sliding piece on the strap itself, allowing the entire assembly to move from waste to face easily. I grew to hate the neck strap because of its ever-present nature (and also because the Sony one is pretty crummy, to be honest) but this one gets out of my way when I need it to. It can also be snapped into a wrist strap. I like the flexibility of this set up.I have noticed some strange behavior of the Sony Semi-hard plastic protective LCD screen cover lately. I am concerned that it's started to come loose from the center outward, as I've noticed an oil slick-like appearance right in the center that goes away if I press on it. I would remove it and replace it, but I have no idea how much strain that will put on the LCD screen. The adhesive seemed pretty strong so I'm hesitant to just yank it off. For anyone looking for a screen protector (seriously, don't go without one!) the Vello Glass LCD Screen Protector for Sony NEX-5 & NEX-7 may be a better option.An update on a comment I made about David Busch's Sony Alpha NEX-7 Guide to Digital Photography: as much as I enjoy having an ebook of this, I have quickly found that reference-type books are much, much better off in the \"real world.\" Being able to thumb through quickly is much handier than trying to find things in the ebook. I don't necessarily suggest this, but if you have the money, having both is handy - ebook for your phone/tablet for quick reference while you're out and about and paperback for sitting down to do some real research. It's simply too difficult to flip back and forth from section to section in the ebook.I've recently purchased the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle Lens for NEX Series Cameras and its companion Sony VCLECU1 High Definition Wide Angle Conversion Lens - Silver to better suit my needs. The kit 18-55mm lens is fine for many things, but I have had a vision in my head of grand landscapes and this lens was far from capturing that. The 16mm and wide angle adapter do. There are many differing opinions on the 16mm lens, especially, but suffice it to say that at the low prices it can be found for, you're hard pressed to find a better deal for this camera if you want to maintain the camera's built-in features. I find that most of my photos since getting this combo are taken with either the pair together or the 16mm alone. With the latter lens, it's an incredibly small camera for its capabilities. I don't really miss using the kit lens, but I have it if I need the tele.Update (July 24, 2012): As promised, the first of hopefully many updates as I fumble my way through this intricate camera.First, I highly recommend David Busch's Sony Alpha NEX-7 Guide to Digital Photography as a must-have for this camera. The manuals provided by Sony barely scrape the surface, providing only minimal information on what the various dials and switches do, but not why and when you would want to use them. Busch's guide tells you all that, and more. If you need an ebook version, it's available at, kind of as they say on TV, \"another large online book retailer\". Be sure and use the link on the Amazon page to bug the publisher about getting a Kindle version.Second, because of this book, I found out that, for whatever strange reason, Sony chooses to ship the camera with the correction for barrel distortion turned off. I've set it to \"auto,\" but it can also be set to permanently \"on.\" Find this under the Setup option in the menu.  Why you wouldn't want this option enabled is beyond me.Original review (July 16, 2012): Simply put, this camera is a learning experience.  While it's perfectly capable of beautiful images taken fully automatically, the power lies in utilizing its various other settings, be they alternate automatic settings or going manual.  And for that, you simply have to hunker down and start learning.  A quick review here on Amazon by a relative newbie (ahem, me) isn't going to cover what this camera can do... yet.  I fully intend to keep updating this review over time as I figure this thing out.After a month with it, however, I can't be without it.  While I've always been fond of photography, I've never been able to move up to the DSLR world, and after having worked with some of the full DSLRs at work, I don't know that I particularly want to as a casual camera. But I want that quality, and that quality is here in this APS-C camera, which pares down the incredible level of manual abilities easily available at your fingertips on high end Canons but doesn't sell you short on the photographic quality.  It's easy to use in its most simplistic of settings but uncompromising in quality.After a day playing with this camera, I was practically shaking with excitement as I checked out my RAW images in Adobe Bridge and then later in Photoshop.  Here were the kinds of images I've been trying to capture all along - those quick shots of my kids that I could never get, the ones that wound up blurred because kids never stop moving. Here, with the NEX-7, they are perfectly frozen, capturing amazing moments of emotion.  I know I sound like an ad, but it's truly astounding to capture That Moment when you press the shutter button, and I read that the NEX-7 is blessed in that department.What I've learned is what many others have learned: the movie button is in a terrible position and gets bumped accidentally more often than it should. I have more 2 second movies than I want. And once you've shot a movie, it's now in movie-preview mode so getting back to photo-preview mode requires running through menus (I've also read that shooting another quick movie and deleting it quickly will get you out of this, but I haven't tried it.) Sony needs to fix at least this, and could help the button problem with another solution I saw suggested: two button taps to start recording.Word of advice: Get a screen protector immediately! I purchased the Sony Semi-hard plastic protective LCD screen cover and it has worked perfectly, not even noticeable once it's on.Also, get a better strap. The Sony-provided strap is thin and uncomfortable. If you're going to have this slung around your neck, find something that is wide, soft and pliable.  I'm on the prowl for one right now. Complaint inside of a recommendation: the strap attachments on the camera don't rotate!", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera For Pick Up & Go!", "Author": "Ms_Ladi \"...just wandering the world.\"", "ReviewID": "R2XBY7QX1WBP6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not going to be a technical review.  There are tons of great cameras out there, and I've owned quite a few of them.  The Sony NEX-7 has a great combination of fine-tuned elements that make it the #1 Camera of the Day.Photo Quality:  Depends on the lens honestly.  There will be no extreme excitement or revelation to it's awesome photo qualities.  Using this camera will not be similar to using the Leica or the Canon 5D.  However, photos are sharp and colorful.  I use the Sigma 30mm F2.8 Lens and I'm quite satisfied with both.  The lens is fast enough for most situations; focus is spot on even with the constant auto-focusing that's prevalent in the camera.  There is a tad bit of underexposing, however, unlike the Nex-C3, it's not overpowering and can be adjusted.Size:  No, it's not pocketable, but with a nice shoulder strap (I use the Capturing Couture Romance Bliss 1.5\" Strap), it is considered a carry anywhere camera.  I love being able to take this camera anywhere.  The heftiness is just right for my small hands, and it's not too small that I can't find any of the buttons.  It's perfect.  If I carry a purse, I just rest the camera on top...like I'm carrying two purses.Menus:  The menus and buttons are a handful!  It was definitely a pain to get my camera adjusted the exact way I wanted, and referencing the manual is an absolute must.  Once I got the hang of it, it was okay, but I must admit the difficult of the menus made me reconsider my purchase--I almost sent the camera back.Usability:  After accepting the menus and adjustments, the camera is pretty much point and shoot.  I can go manual if I choose or Av priority which is my most used...or even \"P\" if necessary.  The screen is nice to review photos and again, photos are captured instantly.  However, the video is a pain.  I press the video button every time I pick up the camera.  Then I have to go back, delete the video, and hope I'm not deleting a photo.  I wish the video button would have been placed elsewhere on the camera.  I'm also not a fan of the Electronic Viewfinder.  I feel as if I'm looking at a fake photo.Conclusion:  Great camera.  I love to have it with me, I love to take photos with it and show it off like a piece of jewelry, and I love the photos I have made with it.  For pro photographers, a different cam with a better lens may be necessary to capture a better dynamic range.  For hobbyists with money to spare, this camera is the best for you once you've gotten over the price.  For me, it's perfect.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Mr. R.

I bought the NEX-C3 because it was the cheapest way to get a good sensor and manual control. However, after a year of using it, I was really wanting more dials and buttons and was seriously considering moving back to a DSLR. After spending many hours in different camera stores, however, I decided that DSLRs really are too bulky to carry around frequently and that mirrorless really is the future. In my mind, the NEX-7 is definitely the best mirrorless camera on the market right now, and is capable enough to be relevant for 5+ years with a growing system.PROS:Compared to DSLRs, the NEX-7 has a handful of important advantages. Size and weight are obvious, and make a huge difference in conspicuity. Burst mode speed is better than most at 10fps. The shutter lag is very, very minimal and awesomely responsive. The EVF, while not quite as detailed as an OVF, has advantages of being able to show more information (love the horizon indicator!) and give live image previews reflecting DoF and camera settings. With good CDAF you also don't have to worry about front- or back-focus issues on different lenses, though there is an option to micro-adjust the AF.Compared to other mirorrless options, the NEX-7 has the best EVF on the market, a very compact but more comfortable body (better than OM-D E-M5), amazing resolution, and the best control setup to be found on a mirrorless body. If you're a serious or enthusiast shooter, this is going to be your friend. Its autofocus speed is also quite good and is near the top of the heap. I use it with a few legacy MF lenses as well and it works great.Video quality is amazing and is up there with the best from a stills camera. The option for an external mic is great, though it lacks a headphone monitor port.The grip is quite comfortable, more so than many DSLRs I tried! It's surprising since it's still compact. The Tri-Navi interface really is great, and makes changing settings quickly easy. Custom function menus and button assignments make it fairly customizable, though the primary dials aren't configurable. :(CONS:Lens selection is lacking compared to mFT or DSLR brands, but growing and 2013 should be a great year for E-mount lenses. This doesn't bother me since I can't afford to buy it all at once anyway, and plan on building up a collection of primes over a few years.The sensor is such high-resolution that you'll start to notice imperfections in your lenses that you hadn't before. Pixel peeping just isn't as pleasing as with the 16MP NEX sensors unless you pay for the sharp lenses (50mm 1.8, Zeiss 24mm 1.8, 35mm 1.8, Sigma 19,30mm 2.8s). With the kit 18-55mm 3.5-5.6 zoom, images are good but don't live up to the potential of the sensor.The camera also doesn't support UHS-1 speeds, so while it will work just fine with the cards, you won't see the increased speeds. Unloading that buffer after shooting 10fps in RAW or RAW+JPEG modes can take a while!NOTE FOR GLASSES WEARERS:The EVF seems to be closer to the eye than it is in Sony's A65 or A77 bodies. I have a hard time seeing the whole thing at once with my glasses on, with or without the eyecup. I decided I could live with this, but it's a personal thing, and it may drive you nuts. It's nice that the EVF is so big (huge!), but not nice that I can't see all 4 corners at once.Overall, I think this camera is worth the investment for anyone who wants top-notch image quality and excellent physical controls and ergonomics, yet doesn't want to deal with the bulk of a DSLR all the time.

It takes a while to get used to the buttons and dials.  There are so many routes to get to the settings that you want.  I finally settled on Shutter Priority, which I set to 160. I set the ISO setting to Auto. The camera will automatically set the appropriate f-stop.  You need know all of the variables and the buttons that control them. There are about 8 buttons or dials that can change your settings accidentally.  You need to practice with the controls so that you can reset the controls to where you want them.  Both screens are of excellent quality, so if the image you see is too dark or too bright, you know that you have somehow touched a button and changed the setting.  You need to know how to get the settings right again quickly, or you'll lose the shot.My other personal issue is that my thumb is always touching the poorly-placed movie button. There should be a dial that you need to switch before the red button becomes active.  This is a huge fault.  I lose a lot of shots this way. (Sony has fixed this with firmware update which enables you to turn the movie button off.  I would prefer the two-button solution)Finally, the available lenses. I would like a 200mm to 300mm telephoto for instance.  Sony doesn't think that lenses designed specifically for the Nex series E-mount is a priority.  Instead, they have made two different adapters, so that you can buy their Alpha type lenses - problem solved.  I disagree.  The appeal of this camera is its great performance in a compact, lightweight form factor.  Adding adapters to lenses defeats the purpose.  More lenses please Sony, (or Sigma, for that matter.) Please! If they provide more lenses, and fix the problem with the Video button, I would gladly rate this camera 5 stars.Addition 12-18-2012:  Sony introduced three \"new\" lenses.  The total number of Sony E-Mount lenses is now Eight! They are: 10-18mm, 16mm, 24mm, 30mm, 35mm, 50mm, 55-210mm, and 18-200mm.  Four of these lenses each retail for over $800.

I'll add more to this review as I use it... I have an NEX-5 and wasn't going to upgrade- until I did!!... The first day was learning the controls and setting preferences.  The second day was getting some shots.  It's way too soon to say that the photos are better. The NEX-5 is very good, particularly with the 24MM Zeiss.  But what I can say for sure is that the enhanced control along with the viewfinder, will really help me take better shots. In particular, with the camera up to my eye, I can readily adjust aperture, exposure comp. and ISO. A significant benefit is to be able to go back and forth between auto and manual focus with a touch of a button. The NEX-7 along with shooting RAW, along with learning HDR, really has me excited about photography. You can see what I do at Flickr, search Tnex.... Flowerful Shooter is my first NEX-7 post.... BTW, I was going to sell my NEX-5 at Gazelle, but I decided to keep it. There will be times that it will come in handy...Today I had my first long photo walk with the NEX-7.  It was a very sunny day. Without question, the viewfinder made all the difference. There is no way that I could have properly composed shots with the LCD in such bright light....  And the controls are helping me to experiment more. And the built in flash is helpful as well.... Initial post processing looks very good.... I'm finding more and more that I like shooting wide. I'm using the 16MM with the .75 converter....Addendum: I have had the NEX-7 for several weeks. I have totally enjoyed using it and the images are great. But all that changed today when I started getting the dreaded \"camera error\" message after a shot. Sony's conclusion is that I must return it for repair. They will provide a shipping label (not express!) and the repair will take 7-10 days. So I would expect it to be gone for up to three weeks. Needless to say I am very disappointed in this.Addendum: So, my NEX-7 went to repair. After about 10 days I got an email saying the offending part (shutter) was on back order. Yikes, camera gone forever!  I pressed Sony repair for a fix or a replacement. They worked real hard, got the part, and shipped the camera back overnight.

I recently had the oportunity to shoot with a NEX-F3 will visiting relatives and I was stunned at how well the camera metered and its overall functionality.  The pictures I shot with it came out very well at around 16MP.  Still, I was reluctant to buy one of the NEX models (how could a camera this size possibly meet my expectations).  I did some research and discovered the NEX-7 model.

This camera is completely customizible and I am very satisfied with it's capabilities.. So much so that I bought a Nikon lens adaptor (also on Amazon) and will be bringing this on future photo trips.  Although it is not replacing my D2X (few cameras focus as fast on moving objects), it is an excellent alternative to carrying a 5 lbs camera. I only wish Sony made an adapter that would allow my Nikon lenses to auto-focus.. hmmm..Last comment, the NEX-7 can be shot in completely automatic.. However, if I gave it to my girlfriend, she would probably have a difficult time using it because this camera has a ton of bells and whistles.. most of which will get in the way of an unexperienced photographer.  For that reason, if you are not that familiar with a high-end DSLR, and unless you absolutely need the viewfinder, I would maybe suggest the NEX-5.. or maybe even the NEX-F3..

So I purchased the NEX 7 with the Sony 18-200LE lens and am thrilled with it.I've been using it for about a month now and find the camera grows on me as I learn its capabilities. There are many well written positive reviews already posted that go into great detail about just how good this camera is and I agree with them, so I will just comment on a few things that have sometimes been missed.First, I just get great, sharp, eye-popping pictures. I mostly shoot outdoors and the 24 MP provides tremendous detail that allows extreme cropping with excellent results. Initially, I found the autofocus to be ineffective, until I discovered that the focus assist setting NEEDED to be in the off position outdoors or it would ruin the autofocus. Problem solved.Buying a compact camera with a honking lens on it might seem counterproductive but I really like its carrying around convenience. It is not too heavy and the hand grip provides a perfect form to lock your fingers around so that you can effortlessly carry it with your arm hanging fully extended at your side while the camera feels balanced and safe.The electronic viewfinder is pretty cool, although the twinkling dots in low light conditions is a bit distracting. But you learn to live with them, knowing that they do not show up in the final picture.There is a learning curve with menu settings and it takes a while to figure out where in the menus you need to start to find a particular setting. But the tri-navi dials are terrific for quickly adjusting the primary exposure settings. Locking focus on moving objects, like a bird flying by, works really well. I agree with other reviewers who found the video button to be inconveniently placed and all too easy to activate.Manual focus with the 18-200 lens is dicy. The focus ring is very, very sensitive, as it will move if you happen to have your fingers on it while your heart is beating. It needs greater dampening and longer movement to be more effective. That is my one real complaint here. Although the focal length adjustment is tight in the beginning, it eases and smooths out in fairly quick order and I have had no lens creep thus far.All things considered, this is a great camera and I am super pleased with my purchase.

Gabriele", "ReviewID": "R31U80O8SKEL7U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Auto-Focus operates continually while the camera is powered up, not just when the shutter button is partially depressed. This drains the battery very quickly and overheats the processor. It also makes manual focus tweaking after auto-focus (a feature prominently touted in the manual) impossible, since as soon as you let go of the focus ring, the camera refocuses itself. The only way to stop this is to disable auto-focus entirely in the menu and use the focus lock button on the camera back to reactivate it intermittently. Response from second tier service is \"They all do it so it must be OK.\". Since this is a firmware bug, of course they all do it. I am trying to contact the developers directly and will update here if I succeed.Otherwise, nice camera. With the 50mm it is especially good since with the large aperture and stabilized optics, you can pretty much shoot in the dark and get decent images.One more complaint; there is and indicator for stabilization status (a hand icon with ripple lines around it) that constantly flashes right in the middle of the LCD and viewfinder and can not be hidden or stopped.

It does this with E-mount lenses attached to a compact body that is only slightly larger than a point-and shoot-digital camera. The quality of image rendering (both still and video) are the best I have ever used in more than 30 years of amateur photography and 11 years of digital photography (including extensive experience with three DSLRs).Before gushing about the quality of images this camera image captures, let's address the obvious --and surprising-- rough areas in a camera that comes with a big price tag:(1) A user interface that can kindly be described as \"non-intuitive\". This includes three separate control wheels and three separate navigation/menu buttons buttons. While most basic functions aren't too deeply buried, the learning curve is steep for everything else. Be prepared to spend some quality time curled up with the camera's 211-page user guide. Much of this complexity is from built-in effects (sepia, posterization, black-and-white, tilt-pan, and more) that are easily accomplished in most photo editing applications; why they are included in a the user interface of a camera of this quality is puzzling.(2) Strange flash assembly. Instead of flipping directly up from the camera body , the integrated flash is mounted on a telescoping hinge (think of a micro version of a scissor lift). This does not feel especially durable, and I can't help but wonder why Sony chose this design.(3) The video record button is awkwardly positioned on the upper right rear of the camera body, and is easily pressed inadvertently.(4) About that 211-page user guide: it's a .pdf file on an included CD. And the camera ships with NO recording media. These are unfortunate lapses in a camera with a 4-digit price tag.So why is this a 5-star review?These are *totally* mitigated by the quality of the still and moving images it captures.  As an amateur, I seldom need the amount of fidelity that RAW format images offer: this camera's RAW images are where the full 24 MB resolution is revealed. The highest quality .jpg setting suffices for my needs, and at full resolution it yields 6000x4000 pixel images (at 350 dpi) of around 5.5 to 6.5 MB each.The NEX-7 offers options for viewing through the eyepiece or its bright LCD screen (you can choose a preferred mode or allow a sensor to auto-detect your presence near the eyepiece). It also offers settings to reduce or increase the amount of photo information displayed.It has several auto modes and the usual additional selections DSLR shooters are used to (shutter or aperture priority, manual, bulb and scene-based).Video capture options include AVCHD 60i/60p, AVCHD 50i/50p or standard definition .mp4.Included software consists of a simple RAW file viewer and .pdf manuals (quick-start guide a the 211 page handbook).If connected it via its HDMI output to a Sony Bravia television, the television remote can control the image playback functions (for both still and video).At this price, you can choose from many outstanding DSLRs.

I like the fact that I can use my 1D and 5D lenses on the NEX7 (at least at maximum aperture), and all my old, but optically excellent, Canon FD lenses (at all apertures). I also picked up an adapter that mounts a Canon 7S rangefinder lens, and even that works perfectly on the NEX7. I'm now glad that I didn't sell of give away those old \"obsolete\" lenses. I was even able to fit an old Bolex 16 mm movie camera lens (not full coverage, but still works for a limited FOV).The optical performance of this camera compares well with a Canon 50D at ISO settings of ISO 400 or below, and is actually better (lower noise at similar resolution) at higher settings.Although its menus have extensive choices, they are fairly well organized and with the help of a good manual (I recommend the one by David D. Busch) one can always find the item you're looking for.My only complaint about this camera, and for me this is a major \"gripe\", is the fact that the video start-stop button is placed where it is extremely easy to hit accidentally.  I've been using the camera for months, and still find the camera recording video when I haven't intended to do so.  I'm a still photographer and have no need for video recording with this camera.  I sincerely wish that Sony would incorporate a \"Video Lock-out\" item in the set-up menu to disable video recording if one so chooses.A related item is that if you do accidentally record a video clip, and then want to erase it, when you use the erase selection, the camera view mode switches to the video sub-folder.  If you hit the view button to then view your stills, you receive a message stating there are no images.  You have to take a single still shot to get back to the still images sub-folder to view your images.  That's a real PITA an there is no reason for it.PLEASE SONY - Incorporate a video lock-out in the next firmware update.  Please, please!UPDATE April 2013:  Apparently I was not the only customer complaining about the \"too easy to accidentally trigger\" Video (Movie) mode.  Sony's firmware Version 1.02 now includes a \"Disable Move Mode\" option on the main setup menu.  With \"Disable\" selected, accidentally pressing the red \"movie start\" button now just causes a \"Movie Mode Disabled\" warning to appear on the LCD screen accompanied by a bell-like warning chime.Firmware V 1.02 also includes support for the latest Sony NEX lenses.If Amazon allowed fractional star ratings, I would increase my NEX7 rating to 4.5.Thank You Sony for listening.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "Dutton Peabody, Editor \"C D Mann\"", "ReviewID": "R32J4GO77HF1H2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally purchased a competing product (Olympus) and set of lenses.  I kept them a week and was never really pleased with the quality of the results.  It's a great \"looking\" camera but it fell short of my expectations for image quality.  I had already looked at the Sony but couldn't get past the unconventional design and I didn't want an EVF (or so I thought).  But I took a shot and bought the Sony NEX 7, 30mm Macro, 50 1.8, 18-55, etc.  I took about a dozen test shots and then loaded them into the computer to see what I got.  I was absolutely blown away with the IQ from this camera.  I was intrigued from day 1.It took time to learn the camera.  The menu set up is extensive and took me some time to get familiar with.  The camera has a lot of options.  Some are useful and some are gimmicky, but the camera executes every bit as you would expect.  I do play with several of the special modes.  It's fun.  And given that I use a 1D4 and 5D3 for my more serious work, this is a great camera to play with.After I'd used the camera for a good week and was much more comfortable with what it could do, I packed up and sold my 7D.  I was using the 7D as my carry camera.  For all of those purposes the Sony slays it.  The NEX 7 wont be a great sports camera, and it won't unseat my 5D3 in the studio.  But for day to day use, travel, candids, easy carrying, etc. I'm absolutely blown away.  Sony really has delivered an amazing package in the NEX 7.  The IQ and flexibility is better than I had with the 7D.  Moreover, it's super light, compact and easy to carry.  Oh, and accessories/lenses are very reasonable.  The 30mm Macro is simply amazing.  It's on my camera more than 50% of the time.If you buy the NEX 7, get the 30mm Macro.  And give it 10-20 hours of use.  It is very different from your P&S; and it's very different from your SLR.  But it is outstanding at what it does do.Update.Took a trip to Hawaii (Oahu and Big Island) in December and debated between taking the 5D Mark III with several lenses or going with the Sony. I kept thinking that I'd really want the bigger camera system but realized I really didn't want to haul all that gear all over both islands with me. So, I grabbed my smallest Lowe Pro and the NEX 7, 30 macro, 18-55 and pancake. I knew I would not have the reach I would with the bigger lenses from Canon but also knew that normal, wide and small zoom would probably cover my needs. The only time I wanted a bit more reach was at the Kilauea Caldera. Otherwise I was good with those three lenses. (I left the 50 1.8 at home). Having had a couple of weeks to review the pictures both form the NEX 7 and the RX 100 I am entirely pleased. There was NOTHING that I was lacking in terms of expectations and results. I could have had more flexibility with my Canon system BUT that would have meant hauling a lot more gear and a lot more weight. Instead I had a small shoulder bag with a couple of pounds of gear which was great for hiking over lava fields, climbing mountainsides, walking the beaches, hiking the rain forests, etc. and arriving at my destinations with fresh shoulders and legs.

The \"picture\" side of this camera is five stars all the way.  Without a doubt it's the best enthusiast camera I've used.  Excellent size and functionality.  Easy to hold.  Ergonomics are perfect for my average size hands.  Pictures are first rate (I use the kit zoom (black) and 55-210 lens (silver)).  While I don't have any problem with the lens weights or sizes, more black lenses would be ideal (It seems that both the 30MM and 50MM primes are silver, which is okay, I guess, but - hey Sony - what's wrong with black?).The not so good.- The first time I took a video the camera worked perfectly for 17+ minutes.  This was outside on a relatively hot and humid Arizona monsoon-season day.  Thinking I had one that didn't overheat I decided to use it to video my daughter at school performing in a short play, then receiving an award.  What a surprise when two minutes into the video I get the overheating notice.  It almost immediately shut down.  Thinking it was just a fluke I restarted the camera and one and a half minutes later the same thing happens.  At this point I didn't care about the camera and just kept restarting the camera in order to get 1-2 minutes of  video at a time.  Needless to say the video was butchered.  Not sure why the first time it worked perfectly and the next time it was a dud, but I know I can't trust it to take video, which was a major selling point.  Before anyone tells me that it's a camera first, remember that it's SONY that's advertising it as both, and I made my decision based on that.  Maybe Sony should change their advertising to say it's an excellent still camera, but one that also comes with some very limited video capabilities as well, and leave it at that.  I doubt anyone would be disappointed with language like that, though the price point might then become an issue for some.- No intervelometer (for time-lapse photography).  Really, would this have been such a hard thing to add in?  It looks like I'll be ordering a Tempus to take care of this.- BTW, can someone with more experience with this camera please explain why the stabilization icon - a hand with lines on either side of it - constantly flashes in the middle of the LCD? I can't figure out how to disable it and it's starting to get annoying.Bottom line: If you expect it to work as a be-all end-all video and still camera, forget it.  Make your decision on purchasing the NEX 7 based on only the camera side of the house.  Trust me, if pictures are what are important to you, buy one and don't look back.  You won't be disappointed.  And then, if you get one that doesn't overheat when taking video it's just icing on the cake.  But if you listen to Sony and expect it to do both, just make sure that you carry your old video camera along with you for the first several times just in case you get one that overheats so you don't miss anything that's important to you.  If it doesn't overheat after several videos you'll probably be okay from that point on.All in all, while some may read my input above and decide that it sounds like the camera is only so-so, DON'T MISUNDERSTAND.

I am an amateur fine arts photographer. Until my NEX-7 was delivered, I was a Canon enthusiast. My goal by ordering the NEX-7 was to use it as a complete replacement for my Canon t3i. After shooting with my Sony the first weekend in July, I quickly realized the days of me being a Canon guy were over. Nothing against Canon, but I needed more simplicity in my life and I am getting too old to carry all my Canon camera gear around with me on the long photo walks I take.One of my favorite forms of photography is what is commonly referred to as \"painting with light.\" I love to shoot way out still images of colorful moving lights, such as the lights on amusement rides one sees at night at a carnival or amusement park, as well as Christmas lights. This form of photography requires me to put the camera on full manual mode. I usually set the aperture to f/20 and I take various shots of whatever interests me while the shutter is set to 2 seconds, but usually longer. I do this with the camera on a tripod and the Sony 18-55mm kit lens I bought with my NEX-7. I also sometimes vary the focal length of the lens while the shutter is open. I am getting incredible results! I also shoot exclusively on raw mode. I recently had one such image professionally printed, matted, and framed. That photo is hanging in my office at work and it gets a lot of positive comments.I also do a fair amount of travel, macro, and nature photography. I bought the Sony 55-210mm lens primarily for travel photography and it works well. I like that lens a lot, but I mostly use the kit lens. Several passersby have asked me about my camera when I was out shooting with it, including one of the sound engineers at the Philadelphia Folk Festival last Sunday who was very interested in my comments about it. We chatted for about 20 minutes about my NEX-7.The NEX-7 is not perfect though, I have two minor problems with it. First, the selection of E-mount lenses is scant. I want to buy a good quality macro lens, but none of the lenses I have seen have been reviewed by enough consumers yet to make me feel comfortable about buying them. I also want to buy a long zoom lens, such as in the 300mm-500mm range, but none exists yet as far as I know. I am assuming the selection of E-mount lenses will expand as Sony sells more cameras that use that type of lens. In addition, when I save the NEX-7's raw image files on my Mac (with OS X 10.8.1), the icons in the Finder do not display what the corresponding image file is; all I see is a blank white icon for each raw image file. I hope Apple and Sony offer up a fix to that problem soon.In conclusion, if I had it to do again, I would still buy the NEX-7. It really is designed as if photographers, not electronics engineers designed it.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and Excellent Picture Quality", "Author": "Michael Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R18GEMK72LMMXK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for about a month now, and wanted to wait a bit and use it a while prior to writing my review.  I have been using a Canon SLR for the past five years, so a lot of my experience (and basis / comparison for this review) is using the Canon as a benchmark.  I am not a professional photographer, just a husband and a dad that takes a few pictures in our walk of life.The shutter speed is pretty darn fast - a lot faster than my Canon.  Sony has done a good job with the technology that allows rapid-fire clicking and if you aren't careful you will have whipped out 3-4 shots when you only meant to take one.  I had to practice for a bit to get the method down.Switching the lens out for my Canon-branded zoom lens was easy, but I needed an adapter.I took several indoor pictures with medium and bright lighting, and several pictures outdoors of the flowers in my garden, at the same time, as a comparison of the Sony and my trusty Canon.  I then put the pictures side-by-side on Photoshop and the ones outside with the Sony and the same lens were much more crisp, colorful, and printed a lot better than the Canon; the ones taken inside with either lighting situation were just a little bit better in looks for me - I will attribute that to the larger megapixel of the Sony vs. the Canon.This is a fairly well-built camera, and has a smaller profile than I thought it would and really doesn't weight too much.  This is not something you can put in your pocket or a smaller purse but, depending upon the weight of your lens, you're probably not going to have a pinched nerve in your neck after wearing it to a gymnastics meet.I have not used the video that much, maybe about 30 minutes or so, but the resolution and sound is pretty good - I think my standalone Sony video camera does a better job, but when you want to quickly revert from one to the other this model does an acceptable job.The battery understandably drains down quicker on video mode, so if you plan on doing a lot of video with this camera you might want to consider buying a larger-capacity battery or a backup that is charged.  For straight photo shooting, I didn't notice a large degradation in the battery power after several  kid events (50-75 shots per session), and I usually put it back on the charger at the end of the day.  Your results may vary.One neat thing to me is you can look at your shot on the digital screen, but if you put your eye up to the viewfinder it automatically detect s you looking through the viewfinder and switches the view to it and turns off the LED screen which will conserve your battery.  They also have GPS tagging, which could help you when you review your pictures and the inevitable question \"where was that taken\" question comes up.Overall, I think this is a really nice camera and I am using it exclusively now - since I have additional lenses, I am liking this one even more.  If you have extra lenses, I would recommend this one - if you are a casual photographer, seeing this one is fairly pricey I would recommend something more economical as $1,400 is a lot of money to pay for just a few pictures a year.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Advanced package excellent for the price", "Author": "Ozzie Alfonso \"Ozzie Alfonso\"", "ReviewID": "R2AVNCBF1UQGV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SONY's NEX-7 is a \"DSLR\" unlike any other DSLR: no mirror; electronic viewfinder as well as standard screen, and one that swivels in two directions.

The camera also has a built-in flash that can swivel for bounce flash. Interchangeable lenses with adapters that allow the use of many lenses - primes as well as zoom, adds to this camera's versatility. The NEX-7 can do so much that its vast number of options nearly becomes a hindrance. Because of this, there is a bit of a learning curve. This has prompted me to settle on the few controls I am most used to, and ignore the rest of the options until I have the time to explore and practice. It goes without saying that with a 24.3 MP sensor the images are outstanding - sharp and nearly noise free even in low light. The noise reduction option when shooting long exposures works quite well.For a small, lightweight, DSLR that is not a real DSLR camera, and for a price much lower than most DSLRs, the SONY NEX-7 is well worth your attention.

Today, I love photography. I have learned all about digital photography by playing with the cameras, reading articles and watching videos in YouTube.What's ironic is, not so long ago I went through a phase where I told myself that since I know how to properly take pictures now, I should just find myself a big DSLR.

I have the brief instructions that came with the camera as well as the Owner's Manual I downloaded, but see nothing regarding the flash popping up, other than manual intervention.

It's weird getting used to autofocus, but it does about as good as a pocket camera, such as the Canon S100.  However, I've been successful getting action shots of shore birds, which is the main reason I bought it.As for an inexpensive M counterpart, the shutter noise is horrendous.  I'd guess it's about twice as loud as the M8 and about five times louder than the M9.  Switching from the NEX-7 to the X1 or X2, I sometimes think I missed a shot because I can't detect the shutter release once I've gotten used to the conspicuous NEX shutter.With the M lenses, it's actually quite a decent camera.

So I went and purchased a Brand New Sony Nex-7 with a Kit lens 18-55. I know that I would need to buy a better lens in the future, but for starters until I get used to my new Camera, I would just stick to the kit lens.I would like to state some reasons for switching:Well basically for starters, the T1i is just so bulky and big, and also heavy and became even more heavy the longer you use it when your outside shooting some landscape, especially while walking around. At times I used the 55-250 IS lens by Canon and that can be pretty heavy and very uncomfortable.Second thing that bothered me is that when I used Flash, many times it just freezes with a message saying 'busy'...I found this to be very annoying.Thirdly, the low light photography is below average.And finally, the image resolution of 15.1 MP didnt do so much for me, especially with all that background noise.What I love about the Sony Nex 7, is its versatility and compact and light weight features. You can just take it anywhere with you while walking and taking pictures, its very reserved and doesnt yell \" hear I am a big camera'. It feels like a pocket camera but with pro features, such as an in built flash, and electronic view finder, which is extremely well made. The 24.3 MP can't go wrong, and the pictures that are coming out from this little marvel surpass anything that Canon did for me by great leaps. The pictures are stunning, clean, crisp and very sharp.So the rational question that I asked myself was who needs the extra baggage when the Sony brings out vastly superior images?I'm not a fan of Canon or Sony, I'm a fan of fine photography and beautiful clean and sharp images, and if Sony at this round does the job for me much better, then I go for the sony, I don't care for names, but for quality.BTW, before I decided to buy the Nex 7, I was thinking to get the Sony RX 100, another stunning little marvel, but this one is just a pocket camera, and I wanted something in between a pocket camera and the DSLR, and I think that the Sony Nex 7 is just that, a perfect balance between the two.Cheers!", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera but failed in less than 2 weeks and terrible customer service", "Author": "Andy B", "ReviewID": "R2AR4RX38MCPVN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought a new new-7 from amazon less than 2 weeks ago. Second time shooting a football match and the EVF failed - flashed an error saying it was disabled and allow it to cool (odd given it was not much above freezing) - over 24 hours later and still the same problem and no functional EVF which was a big reason for buying the camera.Sent it back for a replacement since overall I was pleased with its performance except for the error which seems fairly rare judging by other internet commentary hence why I was willing to get another one.Received the replacement today and it's a used/refurb one! This is just an absolute DISGRACE. I pay $1,000+ for a camera that fails in less than 2 weeks and Amazon think they can send a refurb to replace it - AMAZON YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!Then had to go through Customer service because the returns center would not permit a refund! (as though I'd trust them to send another replacement!). I'd advise anyone else returning for a replacement to check the contents carefully - new ones come with various stickers and tags on and sealed packaging - if yours doesn't have this then send it back, you bought a new one so the replacement should be new.Back to the camera.  (which I would give 4 stars to outside of the EVF failure and Amazon's replacement policy.)The sensor has superb resolution and the 55-210mm lens is an excellent accompaniment. The only thing I've found it to be less good at than my 5D MkII is for getting a rapid AF and the sharpness of images from those football matches. (In fairness the high ISO performance which many criticize it for, I found to be extremely good and the football game I was shooting in the evening under the lights produced images that were no worse than the 5D MkII did under similar conditions and in some cases better.)In good light though the percentage of truly sharp action shots is less than I had with the 5D MkII but the 5D MkII is over twice the cost and the lens I was shooting with is about 5 times the cost of the 55-210mm so it's not really a fair comparison and taken in that context I think it performed extremely well. Of course it isn't designed to be a sports shooter with contrast detect AF but I think it does it better than many would expect with a little perseverance.I tried the LA-EA2 adapter and an A-Mount 85mm f/2.8 lens with it to try and get the advantage of the phase detection AF but although the AF was faster, though still not as fast as regular DSLR AF, the lens itself just didn't have enough reach for a football game (and I didn't care for the bokeh either to be honest). Sadly Sony don't appear to produce a reasonably priced fast long telephoto lens so I have returned the LA-EA2 and the 85mm and will look into some of the alternate adapters for my canon lenses instead (although of course I'll be limited to either slow AF or MF with those adapters)For macro and studio set shots I found the results to have more realistic color balance and a better overall image quality than the 5D MkII which is certainly saying something.Haven't done much in the way of landscape work with it yet to really comment on that front but I expect it to be of similar quality. For a lightweight compact camera it produces truly amazing images, I only hope the EVF problem is not to be repeated.16mm wide angle lens I purchased had an optical flaw (apparently quite common for this lens) so I can't comment much on it. But surprisingly the wide angle extender lens that fits onto the 16mm lens really didn't reduce the image quality noticeably in the tests I ran (within the limits of the optical flaw on the 16mm lens) so I'd recommend it given the price and the great degree of wide angle you get as a result - 16mm equivalent.Overall it's a great performer and given its size and weight is fantastic to just carry around - I'm far more likely to take it with me than my DSLR and therefore am much more likely to get decent pictures where before I would have none or phone camera pictures.Oh and be sure to read the manuals, the interface takes a little getting used to but is well worth the investment in time.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "DSLR users might be disappointed.", "Author": "MrsSmith", "ReviewID": "RLSB2EXE7W2O4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an \"upgrade\" to my Canon XSI. The amazing reviews and small size drew me in, as well as its impressive specs. Well, I guess I didn't know what I didn't know, and I am honestly slightly disappointed. Side by side, IN GOOD LIGHTING this one beats my entry level DSLR hands down. However, it needs to be noted that as a way to keep its small size this camera uses contrast auto focus. DSLR's use phase detection. Without trying to go into technicalities that I don't quite understand myself, the fact is that in mediocre lighting on moving subjects contrast auto focus is SLOW. In low lighting, it is practically non existent. Around my home at night time, the camera searches and searches for a focus point, and often will never find it. My dslr will fire a few pre flashes, and find it within seconds. I find myself constantly telling my 4 year old \"HOLD STILL so it can focus!\" which is a phrase I never used with my canon, When my boys get into sports, I think I will continue to find myself reaching for my canon.Another downside is battery life. While my canon battery used to last me a week to a month depending on use. I find this battery lasts about one week max, and sometimes not even a full day. It is hard to remember to check my battery constantly since I am not used to it, but with time I am sure I will adjust. Definitely invest in a backup battery if you choose this system.The image quality in the right lighting is phenomenal. It is very nice to have a pop up flash that I can bounce off the ceiling when I need some fill light. It was light as a feather until I paired it with the 18-200mm lens, and the video quality is great for home clip use.

The camera's I own are: Canon 60D w/ 18-200 canon lens, Canon G1x, Canon SD780, my Sony NEX-7 w/Sony 18-55mm & 18mm 2.8 lens, Sony HX9v, and my Sony WX9.My previously owned camera's are: Canon S95, SX210, S80, S70, S50, S20 - Sony NEX-5, Sony HX5, - Olympus C4040. I won't go into my film camera's, but I do currently own the Nikon 35ti.I chose the NEX-5 to enter the NEX field because I didn't want the touch screen directory found on the NEX-5N, and found the NEX-5 directory easy to use.  The NEX-5N was 2 million pixels more than the NEX-5, and did have better high res pic quality, but not that much better than the NEX-5. And the NEX-5 really started it all. I know the NEX-3 was there, but the excitement really didn't start until the NEX-5. But yes, for the money, the NEX-5N is one hell of a camera.The NEX-7 has the same basic type of directory as the NEX-5. And I don't like touch screens cause they aren't always as positive and as easy to use as I'd like, and your LCD screen is always dirty. If you're use to the NEX-5 or NEX-3 for that matter, you'll fall right in to the NEX-7.But the NEX-7 is SO MUCH MORE than the NEX-5 !! IT's got the 2 quick control dials on the top right for instant Exp Comp settings, Aperture/ shutter control, and a Built in flash, and is much more ergodynamic with the grips. I like the adjustable electronic viewfinder too. This camera has so much more than all of the others! And the 24 megapixels doesn't hurt it a bit! The pictures are really breathtaking!If your new, you'll find the NEX-7 overwheming with all of the options & settings. But you can always throw it in full auto mode! But the size is what is really interesting. I don't have to lug my 60D around!this is kinda a quick & easy review, to which I'll add later, but it'll give you maybe a slightly different take on this camera.The speed of this camera is fascinating, at 10fps! I purchased the 3-lens set with the 2x doubler, the Macro & the fisheye wideangle. I'll use the 2x doubler instead of going to the very expensive 18-200 sony lens for my distance shots. I know it won't be the same, but I won't have to contend with that lens on the camera.I really just love this camera!!Update 9-26-12  After using this camera for a month, I have to say that unless you plan on blowing up your pictures beyond 8\" x 10\", you really can't tell the difference between the NEX-7 and NEX-5 in picture quality. For the normal photographer, the NEX-5 or NEX-5n will do the job. BUT, the NEX-7 has alot more in comfort and ease of use than the other NEX's. The 2 extra control dials found on the top right of the camera provide instant access to whatever you want in camera settings (5 different settings) for instant controls over picture quality. That along with the built in flash (even if it is a weaker than normal flash) and the electronic view finder, in additon to the suburb LCD, make the NEX-7 a very easy comfortable to use. There are also built in rubber/vinyl hand pads on the camera (right front & back) for a better hold. The only problem would be the price.Update 11-5-12  First of all, the add on/ screw on lens attachment kits, or individuals, ie... zoom, macro, wide angle, that you can buy for this camera, don't really work that well. When the zoom lens is on, the field of view is gone except at max zoom. It's like looking through a straw. I couldn't get the macro or wide angle to work the way I wanted, but, the kit I got was not he best anyway. I already had an older optical zoom lens I use here anyway.I'll say it again, I don't see a quality diff between my (now gone) NEX-5 and the NEX-7. That Said, the extra features of the 7, not available on any of the other NEX's, are really a must have, and make this camera really stand out from all the others. After all, you'd spend the money on something else & then forget about later anyway! One example, the on board flash, with it's controllable flash intensity, neat! Note: the 18-200 lens, will slightly interfere with the flash, but there are ways to work around that, and for me, if I need a 18-200 lens, I just go to my 60d. Lets face it, the NEX-7 shouldn't be your only camera anyway. But even if it is, no camera does everything perfect anyway. I personally really like the new digital viewfinder, it's very similiar to the older digital camera viewfinders.  But really, this camera has great control over all of it's features. And comparing the NEX-7 to the other NEX's, you're really buying the features & comfort anyway. Yes, the stock lens could do a little better, but you'd be paying alot more for the camera.

The lens selection is very good, and, I assume, evolving. My only complaints so far: the position of the shutter release is too close to the two control wheels, making it very easy to accidentally change settings like aperture and exposure compensation. Also, I kept switching on the video function by just barely nudging the activation button with my thumb, much too close to the control wheels and shutter release. It, too, needs to be relocated. As for the HDR function, it only takes two exposures, not enough for true HDR. You can, of course, bracket manually. Perhaps a firmware update can fix this. The video is rich and vibrant, playing back beautifully in full 1080 resolution and full stereo on my HDTV. There is a lot more to explore with this camera, but so far I am pretty amazed at the quality build and rich feature set.9/15/12 - After using this camera for about three months, I can confirm that the accidental tripping of the video function is a major, major hassle. It is very poorly located on the right hand grip and has resulted in numerous and infuriating incidences of unwanted video activation. I don't know how many shots I have missed because of this. There badly needs to be a deactivation feature offered in future firmware updates. Also, the NEX 7 is not a fast camera.

If you are not going have your photos printed or viewed in a huge size, the cropping can be quite useful;- The contrast auto-focus detection is fine and it does a better job in the dark areas than I was expecting;- Peaking mode and auto-zoom are work well for manual focusing;- Good grip for a small camera;- Option for Minolta/Sony flash units- Handy built-in flash that can bounce light upwardsCons:- No small and fast prime lenses. The one I got from  Sigma is not that small;- ISO selections on manual mode is very limited: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, etc... It would been nice to have the option to select 1000, 1250 and 1400;- Movie Rec button is very easy to hit by accident.

I would never claim to be a pro, but I understand the value and usability of cameras that do more than point-and-shoot.In the last few years, my household has acquired a Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Sensor DIGIC 4 Image Processor Full-HD Movie Mode Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-inch LCD and and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens as well as Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens. I've been very pleased with the each of these cameras' strengths, leaning somewhat toward the Nikon.When offered this Sony I was especially interested in the touted smaller body size. This, for a busy mom, is a HUGE selling point. I wasn't disappointed. At least 30-40% smaller than the Nikon and so much easier to tote around.While there are manual functions a plenty, I find the iAuto function to be adequate for most of my needs. This camera is brilliant at taking photos. Seriously have been hearing friends go on over the quality of photos. I feel like a Sony sales rep when I talk to them :)After about a month of sticking with iAuto, I moved on to experimenting with other options. I waited so long because I wanted to have a good feel for the camera, plus, when you have a 2yo running around you can't take the time to set up the special settings quickly enough.Branching out into the settings you can use in the manual and semi-manual modes (like miniature, BW and red, High contrast BW) opened a whole new world of love for this camera. AMAZING PHOTOS! Even more comments from friends. I feel like a pro, but the biggest decision I have to make is \"Which special setting to use today?\" That and whether to go with aperture or shutter priority depending on lighting and location.Even if you don't have mad technical skills for taking photos, this camera will help you out by just testing the waters with settings.It possesses even more advanced features than the ones I regularly use, but I haven't gotten into those because, as I said, I have a 2yo on the loose.Also, when I've printed photos from this camera at home, they are super sharp, even up to 11x13. I happen to use HP Photosmart B8550 Inkjet Photo Printer, which is an excellent at-home printer if you're addicted to displaying all your newest favorite photos.If you only own one camera during your child's young life, this should be it. Compact enough to carry without being a hassle. Takes amazing photos, super easy to use and offers hi-quality recordings as well.The ONLY downside to this camera is the placement of the 'record' button. It's basically on the natural thumbrest for the the camera so I've turned it on countless times.I know it's pricey, but so worth it if taking more creative photos is what you're seeking, especially as a parent.", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Any Level", "Author": "Jessica McKelden Cave", "ReviewID": "R16CXYWZ4PDFIJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as an upgrade to my slightly older point-and-shoot.  My previous camera worked quite as well, but definitely had several issues. It did it's job, however, and it was good enough for my casual photography. This camera, however, blows it out of the water.The Good:* It's the perfect size for my hands. I have really small hands, so it's hard to find good cameras (especially bulky DSLRs) that fit my hands without literally being uncomfortable. This one has a great grip and it's really comfortable to hold, even for long periods of time. It's also fairly light weight, so I don't feel like I'm always carrying around a rock.* The shutter speed is ridiculously fast. I've never seen a camera with one so fast and I don't ever want to use a slower camera now. I get great spontaneous shots now because I can just grab the camera and shoot in a matter of a few seconds.* I've extensively used the continuous shot and it works very well. The photo quality does go down a little, but that's to be expected. I've used the continuous shot mode to photograph several live sports games and the photos have been great.* The autofocus is superb. It has 12-point focus, meaning it pretty much gets it every time. It does it quickly and efficiently.* There are tons of camera mode options. The panorama is really cool and works well. I mainly keep it on Intelligent Auto and it works really well. There are plenty of manual settings as well, but I haven't really used them to much yet.The Less Good:* The camera life is less than I'd like. It's just about spot on with the estimate (approx. 400 photos per charge), but since I'm known for taking 1k+ photos in a day thanks to continuous shot, that just doesn't work for me. I'll definitely need to get some spare batteries.Obviously, there is a lot more good than bad to this camera.

Could not get the courage to get rid of them; thought I was just keeping them as novelty antiques. But along comes the NEX-7! I put up some macro shots above. It is such a pleasure to use old lenses with a large focus ring. I pick the aperture and the NEX-7 nails the shutter speed. Can also do all sorts of tricks in manual mode.If you are wondering if it is worth making the leap into a high end body, this is a fantastic option. The standards Sony lens is great and highly functional, portable and light weight. I am just learning the interface but the Sony 3 button system is very robust and allows you to make all adjustments without taking you eye off the viewfinder. The HDR and panning features are really good with stunning results (that comment is coming from a native image purist who does not believe in post processing).The only down-sides so far it the location of the video record button (on top of the grip). I find myself inadvertently going into video recording. It would be great to be able to disable the button. Also, the flash is a bit limited, but if you are in this space you probably want to add a proper accessory flash.I used the Lumix GF-1 for two years prior and considered the Nikon 1, and I can say I feel like I am in another world so far.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best of breed.", "Author": "Z.

Usability and image quality were my top priorities. I have used Nikon, Micro Four Thirds, Fuji, full frame, crop frame, etc. etc.I keep coming back to the NEX system, with the NEX-7 by far the best option, due to the sweetest combination of pure image quality and usability. The electronic viewfinder/LCD shooting that makes these small cameras possible is mastered by Sony and no other manufacturer comes close to this level of performance. The three dial system is amazingly convenient. The comfort of the design is beyond any of the competition.There aren't very many good E mount lenses yet, but, there will be. For now, the E 24mm F/1.8 Zeiss lens and the E 50mm F/1.8 OSS are a killer pair covering 90% of anything anyone shoots. I grabbed the LA-EA2 adapter to use with a Tokina 11-16mm for landscapes/ultrawide and the amazing Sony 70-400G on a gimbal head for wildlife. I also picked up the Sony 85mm F/2.8 SAM to have a little extra reach for portraits and another style of street photography. It's also excellent for kids since the phase detect AF is very responsive and, despite being budget, the lens is sharp and fairly fast. It's also very small and light.Later this year, a smaller faster NEX specific version of Rokinon's amazing 8mm stereographic fish-eye will be released. I will be buying it for sure.The camera is amazing, the options for expansion are beyond any competitor (No other competitor offers an adapter that adds full time phase detect AF with 15 AF points, or anything anywhere near it.) and the usability blows them all away, especially when it comes to manual focus lenses.I hope Sony continues to develop this class of camera for a long time as it's a pure joy to use.

But as I used it, I found that the simplicity of the Nex 3 was really bothering me.  The menu system was clunky and I could not get to the settings I needed.I just got my Nex 7 today and boy, I could not be happier.I love the fact that the body is so small and light.  My philosophy is \"the best camera in the world is the one you have on you.\"  With that in mind, I believe in investing in a good phone camera (like my Galaxy S4) and now my Nex 7.  I could easily have the camera around my neck without having to lug around a brick all day.  (Those of you with the big Canon and Nikon know what I am talking about).  It gets old quick.Things I love about the Nex 7:- All the features of a big SLR but not the weight.- Plenty of lenses (finally)- AMAZING low light capability.  The Nex line is unique in this capability of shooting 6-10 shots and then making a composite...which reduces the noise and blurred movements.- Access to the vital dials quickly...I can now change Aperture size, ISO, and exposure compensation through external knobs...rather than a complicated menu system- EVF.  My Nex 3 did not have a view finder...and during bright days, this can be a problem.  Nex 7 solved this.- A convenient AF/MF toggle lock.  This was not a pain on the Nex 3.What I don't like about the Next 7:- The Nex 3 had some nice pre-sets when you have the camera set on Ai.  They took these functions away- Unlike a point and shoot, the zoom is limited by your lens.  My point and shoot Lumix goes up to 40x and is amazingly sharp.- You are limited to a .7 bracket x 3....I was hoping to be able to set a higher bracketing set for dramatic HDR photography.  I will have to settle for +/- .7.I was seriously contemplating updating my camera with a Nikon or a Canon 70D....but upon learning about the Nex7, and after reading all the great reviews, I decided to stick to Sony.  I have a bunch of lenses and accessory for the Nex series, and now I could not be happier.Mac Owners - PLEASE READ======================If you are getting a Nex 7, then I am assuming you want to be serious about your photography.  If you get this camera, I HIGHLY recommend that you take the leap and buy Aperture.  It's only $80.  I could not be happier.  I was humming and hahing about \"why do I need to spend another $80 when iPhoto does a lot of what I want?\"  Trust me.  There is a reason why professionals use it.  It is fast, and fantastic.Also, be sure to buy Google's Nik Software suite.  It's only $149.  This suite used to cost $500, but when Google bought the company, they slashed the price.  This suite allow you to do some ridiculously cool things...like HDR photography and a number of very cool filters that take your photography from \"hmm, that looks nice hon\" to \"OMG! That looks fantastic!\".Seriously, get this camera.

The bigger problem is focusing.  For a vacation camera its one of the best, if not best, small camera to take around.  For any sort of studio-like work, it is no match for a DSLR (any DSLR).  The viewfinder has some lag, and even blacks out momentarily while writing files, or doing who knows what.  Also, it's hard to work the controls while looking into the viewfinder (which is why I bought it to replace my 5N). Again, this is a marvelous camera.  But think twice if you expect it to match the focus speed in DSLRs.Video Limitationso. The viewfinder is helpful for taking photos (I have old eyes), but using it in video mode, it may add your heavy breathing to the audio.  Does for me. Without the viewfinder, I might as well use the 5N, which is smaller.o. Once you're recording video, focus peaking (zoom) is disabled.  That means if you set your focus, manually, to someone on the left, and then start recording, and then pan and focus to someone to the right, say closer, you can't go into focus peaking.  You have to focus using the standard view.  The viewfinder is not sharp enough to do this perfectly. In short, you can only use focus peaking once in video, before you start it.o. For both photography and video, getting into focus peaking in manual mode is a pain.  It only pops up when you change the focus with the lens.  I often forget, then end up getting lost in menus (because I was trying to use them to move my flexible focus spot around).o. You can't set focus by looking at feet marker on lens, or display.  There are none; that is, nowhere will you read that your lens is focused on something 5ft away.o. Screen does not flip out to do self-videos. (just in case you miss that in product description).o. In auto-focus mode, the camera won't always refocus on you should you step in front of the camera.  It expects you to half-press the shutter.o. Whenever you half-press the shutter, to refocus (again, in video mode), it does it fairly quickly, but it goes in and out in a way that is not what you'd see from a professional video camera.o. Like all CMOS camera, the rolling-shutter/jello effect, when you pan the camera, is very disconcerting.All that said, the video quality is superb.

Superb sharpness, quick to focus and I'm beginning to master the controls (when I need them).Thanks Sony.Previous:I have been using SLR cameras for many years and started in the days of film and often had a bag of lenses and light meters with me.  I picked up my first digital camera (Sony DSC707) some years ago and fell in love with digital technology. Unfortunately, my DSC707 was stolen.After that I picked up a Canon XSi with 12.2 MP to replace the Sony and to take advantage of the Canon lenses I had from my film days.  Over time I added Tokina's, Tamrons and some Canon lenses to my collection.  I wear glasses and it became increasingly difficult to manually focus through the viewfinder so I started looking to upgrade in order to improve my camera's autofocus capability especially in low light conditions.  The 60D, 7D and T4i were high on my list.  Enough of the background...I stumbled upon the mirrorless while doing some online research.  I came to conclude there isn't a reason why digital technology should be forced to look like SLRs.  I picked up a Sony NEX7.First impressions, positive:+Incredible image quality in RAW or JPEG.+Incredible electronic view finder.  I no longer need additional dioptic correction on the view finder in order to see through the camera and can once again use manual focus.  The NEX7 EVF is fantastic.  Bright, big, great variety of display options.  What I like best though is being able to see exactly what the photo will look like before triggering the shutter.+The 24MP resolution is fantastic.  Great color and contrast as well.+The kit lens is better than I expected given the reviews I've read.  Clear, crisp, good color, excellent depth of field.+I especially like the small size of the NEX7.  Lighter weight as well but still has a nice comfortable grip and control features.+Excellent build quality.First impressions, negative:-Have to learn an entirely new menu of control options.  I knew this though and actually look forward to digging ever deeper into the menu.-Limited selection of lenses but growing.  The Zeiss and a few of the Sony options are rather expensive.  Tried an adapter for my Canon glass but that didn't work so well.  Mainly because I had to depend on manual focus.-The NEX7 has an auto function that works really well!  I normally select aperture, shutter speed and ISO for each shot.  I don't always have to do that anymore unless I want to.  That's why I have this as a negative but it really isn't.I'm still on the steep end of the learning curve with the NEX7 but am very happy with it.

It has been with me on bike rides, fishing trips, and walkabouts around NYC.  I have yet to find a situation where it hasn't been up to the challenge.  The control I have over my shots and the resultant images are absolutely superb.  Its size and weight are darn near ideal for my shooting style or when I'm clipped into my bike.I used to shoot with a DSLR way back in the day (a 10D, to date myself).  At first, it was great.  Then I ran into both physical and technical limitations.  It was just too big to carry on a lot of the activities I was doing.  It would get left behind or, worse, left in a backpack as I hiked about.  It could also never get the range of colors and tones that I wanted.  While sensor technology has gotten order of magnitudes better, I still find myself slightly underwhelmed by tonal reproduction.  And the size of DSLRs won't change.  It's a form factor that a lot of pros demand, but it's not ideal when you want to hang a camera on your neck when you go out for a day of bike riding.Enter the NEX-7.  After researching this camera for months, it eventually beat out Fuji's X100 on my list.  Now, having used it for about 6 months, I can attest to it being an amazing camera.  My trifecta for excellence is (in order of priority) image quality, ease of control, and size/portability.  The NEX-7 delivers on all three.Remember that I said I'm coming from a 10D, so I'm obviously apt to be blown away by any new/modern sensor.  But this thing... The tones! The range of light/dark as well as color that the camera can capture in a shot still blows me away.The Tri-Navi system is tops.  I can quickly dial in a photo just how I want it.  I've turned on Focus Peaking as well.  This in conjunction with the auto zooming the camera performs when manually focusing (which, admittedly, took me a while to get used to) is absolutely great at getting critical focus.All of this in a form factor that I can comfortably sling around my neck for whatever the day holds in front of me.  Maybe it's a quick jaunt or maybe it's a long bike ride; either way, the weight and size are great.  This, however, does not mean that the camera feels unsubstantial in the hand.  I am comfortable whipping the camera about and shooting one handed even while pedaling away on my bike.  The handgrip is great.  With temperatures dropping and me putting on my hobo gloves, there is still enough camera to hold on to and access the camera controls.Pile on amazing video quality (you do need to be careful not to hit the video record button on accident.

It has quick shutter speed, the pictures come out very sharp, there is plenty of pre-programmed modes that you can use to make your photos look more interesting, the video recording is flawless.I must give it 5 starts because the first impressions don't lie.

Read the reviews from many independent professionals who agree. It is so nice to have a high quality camera that is not a huge, pretentious and heavy beast. You will take more pictures with this because it is so light and ready to go with you in a small camera bag.Some complain about the lack of lenses available but the new Sony, Sigma and Zeiss e-mount lenses fill the gap plus all your old lenses that require simple $10-30 adapters although you will be using manual mode. The focusing assist using peaking level is really good for using your old lenses. Buy one of the generic remote commanders for $10 for additional functionality and low light level tripod use. Try the speed priority continuous shooting mode and it will blow you away how fast this can shoot. I'm not sure of the exact time after turning on the camera to photo ready but it is only about a second or two. The build quality is excellent and weight is light enough but not a cheap feeling.

Many of these issues are the very personal preference of the reviewer, guys.Why did I buy this camera and kit lens?First, I am an enthusiast photographer, proud owner of a D90 and my beloved 17-55mm 2.8 Nikkor lens. I have been taking pictures for the last 20 years. I have taken the equivalent of two years of college courses in photography. I take decent photos. I do not have the intention of becoming a world known photographer, those guys get free cameras and have people carrying their gear!!!!Second, my husband and I did the whole of Sicilia last year. That's when I realize that I had to do something regarding my photography equipment. Unless your are 61 y/o and 5'4\" out of shape lady like me, you would not understand what it means to walk Sicilia with a 5 pound heavy photo equipment. My husband carried the tripod. Listen to me, IT IS NOT WORTH IT!Third, the NEX 7 camera is anything a photographer my level could ever need.Fourth, true, the kit lens are not great. They take good daytime pictures though.Night pictures...well my android cell phone takes better ones.Fourth, yes Sony is draging its feet in the production of quality lens that match the Nex 7's level of technological sophistication. However, I doubt that the wait will be too long.So, my logic was, since everybody says how difficult the menu and tech stuff of the camera is, I will try it with these poor lens until I master it; by then, the semi-professional lens will kick it.Just my two cents.-----------------------------------------------------I continue liking the NEX 7 a lot. I am disturbed by Sony's commercial approach to the production of cameras. From 2011 til now, we have the Nex 6 and a newer version of the Nex 5...Are we to expect a new version of the Nex 7? Instead of a new camera, the Nex 7 needs continuous firmware improvement. The latest firmware update came late and only addresses a few of the claims. Sony needs to get serious about camera production which involves to be faithful to its customers instead of trying to grab new ones by inventing a new toys every semester.I have bought the Zeiss 24, 1.8mm. Boy, what a lens! It enables me to explore all the NEX 7 capacity to produce DSLR quality pictures. I also purchased the Sony Adapter with Translucent technology for the Sony 16-50 2.8.

Gadal", "ReviewID": "R1T379VC4RG4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm really starting to like the translucent Mirror technology that Sony has incorporated into its latest line of cameras.  This makes the cameras much smaller and lighter, which for me is a big plus.  If you've ever carried around a heavy DSLR all day, you'll know how cumbersome the equipment is and tiring it is to lug around.This is a full featured camera with lots of impressive shooting modes, from Panoramic (which I love using), HDR, portrait, action, HD video, and more.  The images it produces are stunning.  I did some low light shooting on Intelligent Auto Mode in a restaurant during my nephew's graduation party, not expecting much, and was blown away at the results.  It captured the mood of the ambient light and produced images much better than using a flash could have.There's a nice big LCD screen on the back for shooting, or you can also compose and shoot using the viewfinder.  There's an infrared sensor that knows when you're looking through the viewfinder that turns off the back LCD screen, saving some battery power and eliminating distractions, which is a very nice feature.  One thing about the back LCD screen, and that's you're limited as to how much you can swivel it.  This isn't all that bad, but something that I wanted to point out, as other cameras have LCDs that can actually be turned all the way around, and if you're looking for that, you won't find it on this model.The battery life is good, and the charger small and compact, which is nice.  If you're a serious shooter, my advice is to get an extra battery and carry it with you, not just with this camera, but with any camera.  Dead batteries mean missed shots.There's a 3D Panoramic Mode that I didn't try, but it's a nice feature for those who are interested in it.There aren't a lot of buttons or switches, Sony has minimized those into just a few, which are quite easy to navigate.  The menus are well thought out and don't take all that long to learn or get used to.The diopter on the viewfinder works great for me, and allows me to set the focus such that I can use the camera without having to wear my eye glasses.  This allows me to use the viewfinder to compose, review, and change menu settings, quickly and easily.I think the technology that Sony has packed into this camera is the future, and probably will replace DSLR camera technology in the not too distant future.This camera is not cheap, but still affordable.I recently had the opportunity to also shoot with the Sony A65 24.3 MP Translucent Mirror Camera and that camera had a couple of features that I wish this one did.  The first being built-in GPS for geotagging, which is a feature I love and use all the time.  I currently use an i-gotU GPS data logger to tag my photos, which is a great product, and if you're interested in geotagging images and don't have built in GPS this is the way to go.The Sony A65 also has a rear LCD screen that will turn all the way around, so that you can get it out of the way.  This camera is a bit bulkier and has a different menu system and more controls to learn.  Despite this, I'm leaning more towards the Sony A65, both for price and because of the built-in GPS.Both cameras are great, so it depends on your preferences.Sony certainly has become a major contender in the digital camera market.

They also need a firmware upgrade for the camera to correct some issues, google it. But more than likely it will be a new camera from SONY with the upgrade, still with no lenses. Absurd.From My Tamron Review:I sold all my full frame stuff and huge lenses, just wanted a good camera that was small. I purchased an NEX 7, but was very disappointed in the kit 18-55 lens. I was simply frustrated that I could not purchase what I considered a high quality lens for this camera. The only one I could find is the Zeiss 24mm and it is no where to be found. So I looked at the Sony 18-200 and the Tamron. Anything had to be better than the kit. I chose the Tamron because of its smaller size and equal performance. Also Tamron now has a fix for the panorama mode.I must say I am very impressed with this lens. It is not a Canon L, but is very well made and the shots are much, much better than the kit and that is what counts. For your money this is probably the best buy right now for your Nex. In the future there will be better G lenses from Sony (maybe) but for now look no further. I have always used the brand lens that the Camera is, so I was skeptical - not anymore. Also the size of the lens is not obnoxious, I rather like the size.Update May 28, 2012. My lens works perfectly with panorama mode.Update: after re- reading my review there is one thing I would like to clarify. The problem with this camera is that you can get just as good or better pics with cameras that are 1/8th of the cost of my setup, around $2000.00. If Sony made lenses the quality of the camera - maybe ok. But the lenses that are available are very subpar, therefore the pics are the quality of a much lesser camera. $2 lens + $1000 camera = $2 picturesSelling mine on Amazon.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Still Camera, However Video Users BEWARE!", "Author": "Jim Taylorville", "ReviewID": "R2X3UKTDG3UN51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i have had my NEX-7 for 2 days now.

I really did not want to spend this much for a camera.I purchased a Sony point and shoot (higher end) to replace my last Sony that got smacked and knocked to the floor.  It still functioned after the accident but it was making some odd noises and it seemed to take much longer to start up and extend the lens.Anyway, the new one had a design issue I did not like.  The pop up flash was right where I am used to holding the camera.I put it in the drawer and ordered the Sony Nex 5n.  It looked like the pop up flash was in the center of the camera.  How surprised was I when I received it and it has NO FLASH built into the body.  You have to attach a supplied flash to the body when you want to take a picture with flash.  I returned it the next day.After an exhaustive search, i ended up with this Sony Nex 7.  There was just no other camera out there that fit my needs.  I did not want a bulky full size body and getting the functions I wanted was impossible with all the other models I looked at.I am sure you are all thinking that this camera is just too expensive.  I tend to agree.  After receiving it, I could not be more pleased.  There is not much it cannot do and it is still small enough to travel with in a small bag.

You will not regret it.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comparison Between Sony NEX-7 & Canon Rebel XSi", "Author": "Conspicuous Consumer", "ReviewID": "RWLSWOAF71Q8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using SLRs for 35 years and my current collection includes a Canon Rebel XSi (four years old and my favorite) and a Canon Rebel T3i (six months old).  After about 20 hours of use, I'll compare the Sony NEX-7 to the oldest Canon for biggest contrast.Image Quality - better than my Canon Rebel (and the Canon takes great photos).  For the money this camera costs, it's reasonable not to try and compare image quality to a $4000 camera or shots by a skilled photographer (which I use at work) but I'll put my photos against some of the pros with cameras that cost twice as much.Image Size - No contest.  The NEX-7 has twice the megapixels of the XSi.  Most of the time, I don't need more megapixels but it's nice to have them when you need them.  I prefer homemade art to store bought and I can put the NEX-7 images on canvas without resorting to Photoshop upscaling.Image Options - Here's where the NEX-7 beats the old Canon.  I love the 16x9 panoramic option and the low light photos on the NEX-7 don't require serious Photoshopping like the Canon's.  On fast action shots, I saw no difference between the two.  I was blown away by the Sweep Panorama that took and stitched together moving shots.  The photos I took of the yard required no editing.  Photos of the kids splashing in the pool created ripples in the water that the stitching couldn't match.  If I'm switching rapidly between portrait, landscape, and fast action shots, I just set the camera on Intelligent Auto.Shutter Speed - So fast as to be no issue at all.  I had to get used to the touch to avoid accidentally taking multiple shots.Controls - Unlike the Canon, you can't easily use this camera without reading the manual.  But the manual is very short and the controls are easy to learn.  I was pleased to see that I can read the options on the LCD screen without my glasses.  I look forward to David Busch's guide to this camera (not yet in print) to refine my techniques.Video - While I can get better video on a dedicated camcorder, I find myself not using the expensive models I own and choosing instead to use my inexpensive, easy-to-use, easy to transport, easy-to-download Flip.  Thus, I only have to compare video quality (for my use) to the Flip camera.  Well this camera beats the Flip but not without complications.  For an easy to understand review of the video options, I suggest imaging-resource (dot)com/PRODS/NEX7/NEX7VIDEO (dot) HTM.  You'll be able to see that even the smallest video option records clear video and you may find stepping down the recording resolution makes it easier to download and view video. iMovie in OSX can't handle AVCHD without using third party converters (Handbrake, Roxio Toast 10 Titanium, Total Video Converter), but VLC can.  You also can download the video in AVCHD on a Windows machine or record in MP4.  The latest versions of Final Cut and Adobe Premiere can edit AVCHD.  I find that my AVCHD recordings are grainy and larger than I need.  I'm fairly satisfied with the stepdown to MP4 videos.Diopter (view finder) - In low light, it has the appearance of a ghost-finder's low-light camera.  It's brighter than the Canon but looks grainy and flickers.  Outside the image appears over-saturated and has waves like would be produced by hot pavement.  It's still useable but I can't tell as easily when I have taken a great shot like I can with the Canon.  Don't forget to attach the eyepiece cup.Swivel LCD Screen - The reason I bought the Rebel T3i was for the flexible view-finder which I had had with an earlier camera.  Once you get used to having it, you find yourself using it all the time to get better positions for photos.  I don't find the flexibility on the NEX-7 to be as good as on the T3I but I'm still very glad to have it.  I also find the NEX-7 LCD harder to view in bright light than the Canon's.Grip - At first I was put off by the smaller grip of the NEX-7 but it works fine and totally unnoticeable after a minute.Size & Weight - Although the difference in weight between the two is virtually undetectable, the NEX-7 is about 40% less bulky, making it more transportable and less obvious when you are taking photos.  But the weight and size of the Canon was never an issue for me.Lens - extremely easy to change.Battery Cover - requires manual locking.  If not securely locked, the battery separates from contacts and quits working.  I prefer the Canon's snap-close cover.Flashcard - hard for large hands to remove.  Remember to format in the camera and reformat whenever you remove all of the media off the camera to keep it unfragmented.Software - \"The Sony camera firmware update does not support the 64 bit kernel on Mac OSX 10.5 or higher.\" They provide a workaround for booting into 32 bit.  I ended up installing the software on Windows 7 running via Parallels.  Go to esupport dot sony dot com for drivers, software, and troubleshooting.  You don't need to install any software to access your images or movies (AVCHD).  Just move them off your card.Photo Numbering - repeats numbers so that I can't add new photos to folder containing old photos.  I got a new 32 GB flashcard and formatted it in the camera but the new photos started at 9417 and all the images are dated Jan. 2011.  Can anyone explain that?  I tried updating the firmware but discovered that I have to reboot my 64-bit iMac into 32-bit mode (reportedly by by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup) so I'll wait until I go into work and just update via Windows.Pros - photo quality, image size, shutter speed, physical size, shooting pre-sets.Cons - diopter, AVCHD video quality.Addendum:  The more I use this camera, the more impressed I am with it.  I have dropped it twice, causing it to momentarily lose focus (I think it's human) and then it would start working fine again.  Although I continue to largely use the basic settings, the quality of my photos continues to improve.  I've been using quality equipment for almost 40 years so it is definitely camera quality that is improving, not me.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera - a few small issues", "Author": "Clive Longbottom", "ReviewID": "R1LCAZJIC4LY0U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Nex-7 is a great little camera, with a couple of annoying problems.

It is a small camera that managed to build-in lots of functions that are reasonably easy to use due to the use of contextually-aware buttons.  On the negative side, the video record button is too easy to hit.  The optical viewfinder does not work well for those wearing glasses, as the eye needs to be close to the sensor for it to switch to the viewfinder from the rear screen.

NEX-6 may be a better option though", "Author": "Hebert Tejada Ito", "ReviewID": "R2CNJ4E0FTOM02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this camera for almost three years now, and I am still loving it. At the moment of this review, it's sensor is rated in DxOMark at number 23 out of 210 cameras, and that includes Full Frame sensors. It has a score of 81, which is even better than some Full Frame cameras, better than most APS-C DSLRs, and much better than any micro 4/3 camera.You can access almost any function with the tri-navy system. At first you have to take your time to personalize the buttons though, and then learn to use them, but once you get familiarized with them, it is great to have everything at the control of your fingers and without even taking your eye out of the electronic view finder (which is outstanding by the way).When I bought it, it was the best option for a light weight APS-C camera. However, now you have the NEX-6, which I think is a better deal if you do not need the 24 Mpixels the NEX-7 has. So, unless you make huge prints (like mural size prints) or agresively crop your pictures in post-processing, the Nex-6 will be a better deal because of the following reasons:1. Less megapixels mean smaller files. If you work with RAW format, each file is very big and requires lots of processing capability from your PC. The 16 Pixels files from the NEX-6 should be much more easy to handle.2. Although the NEX-7 has a relatively fast autofocus, the NEX-6 is much faster because it has hybrid autofocus (phase and contrast detection compared to only contrast detection in NEX-7).3. The NEX-6 has WiFi and the possibility to install usefull apps, which the NEX-7 doesn't.4. The NEX-6 kit lens is the tiny and incredibly light weight 16-50mm pancake lens. It does have heavy vigneting and distorsion, but those are automatically corrected in post-processing if you shoot raw, or automatically in-camera if you shoot jpc. So I think the portability the pancake lens gives to the NEX system exceeds by far these easily corrected flaws.5. With all this in mind, I would be willing to pay the price of the NEX-7 to get a NEX-6, but the best part is that the NEX-6 costs less than the NEX-7.

The biggest issue by far - the deal breaker in fact - was the electronic viewfinder (EVF). I wear glasses, and although the diopter adjustment on the camera allowed me to bring the EVF into focus I could never see all of the display at the same time, even with the camera eyepiece shade removed. Shifting my viewpoint to see the settings or different parts of the display caused other parts to blur or disappear. Also, I don't know if the proximity sensor on the eyepiece had a hard time detecting my glasses, but I had to press them hard against the camera to make the EVF switch on at all.Adding to the woes was the diopter adjuster itself, as its position makes it very awkward to reach and adjust when a pair of glasses is pressed against the EVF. Move your face away just a little and the EVF goes off. That wouldn't be such a big issue if you only adjusted the diopter setting once or twice, but it could get tedious quite quickly if other people used the camera as well.I could have used the rear display instead of the EVF of course, but I find it much easier to use a camera if I don't have to switch my focus back and forth between the close-up back of the camera and a more distant environment.Other reviewers have remarked on how the position of the video button makes it easy to accidentally start a video recording, and I can vouch for that. I also found that I tended to nudge the L and R control dials on top of the camera without realizing it, which when coupled with the video button made the top right corner of the camera back a minefield for wandering fingers and thumbs. I'd probably learn with practice to be more careful, but I think the functionality of the camera would be greatly improved if the action on the L and R dials was slightly stiffer, and if the video button could either be completely disabled in the menus or perhaps require another button to be pushed simultaneously. I wouldn't have been using the video capability of the camera very often anyway, and it would have been nice to take it out of the equation.Other observations. One of the appeals of the NEX-7 was the possibility of using a simple adapter to let me use the lenses from my old Olympus OM-4 camera on it, and in fact when I did that it worked very well. No autofocus of course and I had to stop down the lenses manually, but it was still very satisfying and the image quality on the few shots I took was excellent. Also, I wanted to do a few macro shots of electronic components with the NEX-7, and the lens adapter allowed me to use my old extension tubes and lens reversers with the Olympus lenses to do this as well.One interesting thing I noticed while I was playing around with the Olympus lenses on the NEX-7 was that I preferred the handling of the camera with them versus the kit lens. I liked the look and feel of the NEX-7's kit lens, but when compared with the rubber grip on the Olympus lenses its knurled aluminum finish felt harsh. Also, I don't know if it was the slightly longer length or a slightly smaller diameter on the Olympus lens + adapter, but the camera was much more comfortable to hold with them compared to the kit lens. I didn't hold the grip on the front of the camera as tightly with my fingers, and the back of those fingers didn't rub slightly against the lens barrel as they did with the kit lens. Small details I know, but they made a noticeable difference for me and they suggest that using something other than the kit lens might have unexpected benefits for some people.So, although I found a lot to like about the NEX-7 and I really wanted to keep it, at the end of the day I just couldn't get the EVF to function at an acceptable level for me. People who don't wear glasses - and probably a whole bunch who do as well - won't have that problem, but I suspect I'm not the only person for whom this is an issue. As for the other ergonomic details, well, I could probably have learned to accommodate them if the EVF had worked out.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "No quality Sony lenses for this camera", "Author": "A.

For what's out there now this camera (and it comes close to full on DSLR's) for the price rocks. Game changer. There are some notable small flaws but not any deal breakers. No camera system is going to be everything for everyone.I make photos for a living and wanted something that I could slip into a bike jersey, vest or use to mess around with or leave in a car. Of course I sill wanted/want a cretin level of image resolution. I use other systems including the Sony Alpha 900 with Zeiss optics. I prefer that over my Canon 5D stuff. It's got slightly better everything in the files and the camera is easier to use. Yes, when it's comes to publication it may not matter all that much. If the evocative content is good or great that's really what matters making the capture not so important. What our antecedents used to make great images had little in resolution and clarity compared to what we now have.I only shoot RAW. (hint)24 something mega pixels is a more than we need unless you are making huge prints or cropping a lot. Most of us, my self included, don't need all that horse power but we want it anyway. Always. What's important is the good stuff in the capture files and it's all there with the NEX7 as long as you know some photoshop 101 stuff. Files out of the Alpha 900 or the like need a bit less work.The Camera has way too many menus and settings. This is hard for me because one must understand what you have with the NEX7 to get it set right and then to be able to change it. I supposedly understand this stuff and I find it overwhelming. An engineer might delight in this but me, not so much.As it does not look like a \"pro\" camera it's very easy to use in street situations. Love that. It's pure stealth.For the price the back is stellar but your out front optic is a lot of the game. For a few hundred dollars you will not get the great stuff. How can you? Yes, there are not enough lenses. The 16 works out to a 24mm and I want a wider (zoom) for the way I work.The autofocus works very well and is easy to move around the frame. That's a must for me.I don't know lot a about the video as if yet but I do know it's very easy to accidentally turn it on usually when you don't want to. It's easier to turn the camera on and off to deal with this situation. The video button has to go some where and it did.Every chip is different. The out of the camera exposure and color are ballpark ok but with some tweaking you can tweak for your individual camera. Great feature.The pop up flash works much better with rear sync. I have it turned down around a stop and that's better.The real meat for me is camera shooting flow.. Can one shoot with the NEX7 like one was using a full on SLR? Does it become a fluid extension of you and your vision? The answer is yes and no. The optical viewer isn't the same experience of looking while framing with a conventional glass system but if you can train yourself you will be close. Don't forget you using a true mini now. Unlike a glass prism viewer the electronic viewer's image darkens as your eye gets moves in..this is ok but it means your speed of composition slows. If you are a fast fast shooter then this could bother you. I can't shoot all the time using the screen to frame. That's not in my codex.The camera also needs to power up...this take a bit..the screen or \"eye viewer\" goes from white to the image setting in.For a third of the weight of it's older sibling this flyweight comes very close the same results. It's all overkill anyway for many reasons (like lenses really can't handle more than 21 megapixels) and the NEX7 is superb for what it is.

Because the sensor is openly exposed to the elements every time you change lenses, this sensor can pick up some shmutz. There's a self-cleaning rigamarole in the Sony software, but as far as i can tell, that's mostly a joke capable perhaps of shaking some of the less persistent dust motes loose, but eventually you wind up with flotsom in your photoshop, so you go to clean the sensor only to make matters worse, and then after a half an hour of delicately pushing a lint free q-tip across the sensor trying to soak up all the shmutz you just smeared into a fine film all over the sensor surface. i think that the exposed sensor is a design flaw and i hope it will be addressed in future iterations. There needs to be some kind of cover that closes over the sensor when you twist out a lens, it's not rocket science to shield the sensor of a thousand dollar camera from the elements, is it?Secondly, there is a know issue with the rubber grip coming off after a while. This is true and is happening to my camera, especially now that it's the height of summer heat and the camera has been used extensively for 6 months now. i'm hoping that Amazon will be able to help me get this problem solved since this was a Warehouse Deal purchase.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lightweight and perfect", "Author": "E.

There are few odds and ends that could improve but overall it's another great camera from SONY.Before purchasing the Nex-7 I did think about spent $$$$$ on a used Leica.However, I'm really glad I got the Nex-7.Ed's Notes:Autofocus is slow. Since I use manual most of the time it doesn't bother me that much.The LA-EA1 adapter works great except it's not syncing with my SAL1680z's Autofocus.I believe the LA-EA2 will work much better and have better compatibility.Manly use the adapter with my Lensebaby Tilt-shift lenses.The camera itself has a tilt-shift effect feature except it's only for still shots.Internal flash seems flimsy. It's good for general everyday photo.(Perhaps instead of internal flash on the Nex-7 make it a WIFI trigger?)If you have other Sony HVL mounted flash with wireless capability.It's a good idea to get the HVL-F20AM to enable the wireless feature.Works really well with my product shots.When shooting with video the camera does get hot.Remember if the CCD burnout then the camera is an useless brick.So the best is keep away from direct sunlight or heat source.Film a lot of short takes or give some cool off time in between clips.Also use a separate audio recorder instead of the internal audio.The internal audio can pickup sounds from the camera operator.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "OMG !!", "Author": "V.

Yes, I'm aware of the A7 and A7r, but those barely have any lenses yet...again.  Everything only matters if you print.  Read that again.  It has better low ISO resolution than my Nex 5n.  At high ISO (3200 or above), I turn the NR to low to preserve detail.  All the review sites use default and it smudges all the detail.  It is also true that the default metering is a bit dark.  I don't know if that is to preserve the highlights because some cameras tend to do that, too.  I got this at discount because my 5n has dark dust underneath the AA filter and I'm reluctant to send it in because there is probably nothing they can do except replace the sensor.  An upcoming wedding at the end of the month necessitated getting a small body to use with my Nex lenses.  Although 16MP may be enough, I make 30x40 prints that could use a hair more detail.  The Nex 7 has just enough detail to squeeze out a little more for my prints to call it an improvement.  Having experiencing the Nex system from the beginning, I believe that the Nex 7 was designed at the same time as the original Nex 3, 5.  The Tri dial control is nice, but none of it is labelled like a traditional camera- I may label it myself with tape and a silver marker.  The Nex 6 body is a huge ergonomic improvement and the A7 also completes the gap on user interface.  It is getting a bit outdated, but I need the pixels.  Yes, the A7/A7r are better, but I need a whole slew of new lenses.  Even the current 16-70 Zeiss came out a little late to the party- I am to used to the 18/55 and it's sweet spots.  One of the biggest flaws is the autoISO limits at 1600.  That is probably because noise at 3200 is pretty high compared to a 16MP Nex body.  I don't mind the noise because I can Photoshop it out, but Sony's NR is way too strong to preserve detail at 3200.  The back of the camera heats up much faster than my 5n, but you can lift away the viewing screen to help cool down the camera.  That is probably a factor in higher noise as the pixel/size is reaching the limits.  The relatively new 20.2 sensor in the A3000 fake SLR is probably a good compromise from what I've seen.  The much lauded viewfinder is nice, but I am one of those people who have gotten used to framing the entire shot at arm's length.  It still feels like you are peering into a low quality video camera even though it is way better than others.  Plus pre-2012, the Nex 7 doesn't come with the $15 eye cup, thereby scratching your glasses easily.  Right now, if your needs don't require an A7r (and expenditures + lenses), the Nex 7 will suffice even if the controls/style are a bit first Nex generation.

If you don't have an SLR or video camera, and want to get a very nice \"all in one\" camera you won't do wrong by getting this camera.Ok.. more details.. I use a Canon EOS Rebel T2i, that when I bought it through Amazon it came with both the standard lens and a zoom 55-250mm lens. I love my camera and basically I am \"used\" to it.When I opened this up, I noticed right away it is MUCH more compact, it has a nice weight to it and very balanced.I added some pictures to show you how it comes. You get the body, a 18-55mm lens ( pretty standard, nice..) a lens hood, strap,battery with wire free charger and CD's. No case, no memory card. I added some pictures of it in the product details (above)Ok.. What I LOVE .. it is easy to use.. charge up the battery up and start taking pictures..Other Pro's:1) It has ELEVEN filters... so you can get really \"artsy\" easily, with no outside software ( Photoshop, Corel etc...)2) VERY easy and reliable video.. this I knew would be a home run.. I have a SONY video cam, so I knew this would be a seamless no brainer.3) Battery Life.. for a tiny battery.. this sucker really holds a charge! I have not tested the battery life on video, but so far it really holds a nice charge taking photos.4) Lens Quality.. the included lens (18-55mm) is nice, capable, distortion free and a good basic lens.***** MAJOR PLUS *****5) NON-SONY lens adapter available!.. although I have not tried it, there IS an adapter (optional) that you can use your Canon, Nikon, Olympus etc..lenses on it..This is a MAJOR PLUS... Lenses are expensive.. several hundred dollars a pop at least! It is NICE to be able to use these on this camera! Again I have several Canon Lenses, and have not tried it with this camera, I am wondering if he auto-stabilize works with this camera - but I DO like the idea very much!6 & 7 ) \"Intelligent Auto Focus (..and iAUTO mode)\"these \"Pre-focus as you compose the shot, further reducing focusing time to a bare minimum.\".. in other words.. makes it a \"point and shoot camera..\" ( a high end one!) It is nice to just take a picture without worrying about speeds, exposures etc.. and a VERY nice picture which leads me to:8) A Whopping 24.3 Mega Pixels! I mean.. that is HUGE.. actually it is enormous!So what is the big deal? Well the big deal is Yes..if you are taking normal pics of the kids and the pets you don't \"need this\"..The big deal is that if you take a picture in this ultra high meg range, and you notice something you like that is smaller,you can zoom and crop and play with that section of the image *without* magnifying the image.For example I took a picture of a hawk.. it was very high up.. I took it in full resolution, then brought it to Photoshop, and was able to crop the hawk by itself, and it was still over 3000 x 3000 pixels and crystal clear.9) \"Auto tracking\" as perfected with their video cameras, you can lock onto a subject and the camera will stay focused on the subject.. great for kids & pets10) Compact! I can't believe they squeezed all this power into such a tiny package.11) A well made and printed manual, many camera ( and other things) come with CD or a link to the manual, the manual that comes with it, goes over everything in easy to use instructions.12) The \"Tru-Finder OLED electronic viewfinder\" It is incredibly sharp and detailed. The 3\" screen tilts and really fights glare very well .. but it leads me into the Cons:The Cons:1) No \"real\" viewfinder I like to look though the camera itself, not at a screen.. (This is just a personal preference.)2) Again this is nitpicking.. nothing to do with the camera, just an observation this is a fairly expensive camera it should of included:2a) A carrying case2b) A Memory card or stick.. come on SONY throw in a 4 gig card or stick!2c) No Zoom lens? (again I bought the Canon 2TI with the 15-55mm lens AND a 55-250mm lens for about 980 bucks)Maybe include a 30%-40% off coupon for one accessory ( case, Lens, memory  lens etc..) with the purchase of the camera?Again this is only nitpicking.. this is a really great camera!In a nutshell, this camera really does crank out stunning pictures, has a massive array of \"special affects\" built into it,and also shoots the best video I have seen on something that is a \"camera\" first.Throw in the fact that you can attach your other brand lenses to this.. and you know what?SONY may just have a real contender in the market here!Will it replace Canon. Nikon etc.. as a \"go to\" DSLR? I don't know, however I do know I could point & shoot this cam straight out of the box. I know there is sticker shock with the price, but if you don't have a quality camera and a quality video cam, this WILL do the job of *both* in my opinion, and therefore justify the price.I use this as a \"go-to camera\" when I just don't know what I am going to shoot, say at a party .. what am I going to take? pictures? videos?

Fischer", "ReviewID": "R27224FVTORPO7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "... alas daylight capabilities only.Sony has programmed the NEX-7 for on-camera shutter release, with only very limited functions of the camera eligible for either timer or infrared remote shutter release; Sony does not produce a cable shutter release for the NEX-7 either.  This means that long-exposure bracketed shots (like sunrise, sunset and dark-sky exposures) are a purely manual affair, requiring you to touch the tripod-mounted camera between shots, moving it ever-so-slightly, before releasing the shutter for the next bracketed shot with the infrared remote.  Additionally, the maximum exposure achievable with external shutter release is 30 seconds.  {Sony's remote for the \"bulb\" function (holding the shutter open for as long as the release is pressed) is also a very finicky gadget that has ruined multiple \"dark sky\" shots in Yosemite and Death Valley.}  I have written to Sony customer service and posted on their board two weeks ago, asking if any software/hardware resolutions are planned for these shortcomings, but have been ignored so far.  Please figure these limitations of the camera and of customer service into your calculations, because there are better pro-sumer low-light, long exposure cameras out there for the same price, or even lower.  I will update this post when Sony either brings out a firmware update, or decides to answer my feedback.UPDATE: Concerning the bracketed statement, I determined that I had a faulty remote release for the camera.  I found that the infrared remote releases the shutter for a maximum of 30 seconds and closes it upon a second press, if 30 sec have not yet expired.  Please note that the remote only works if the infrared beam can reach the front of the camera.  Concerning infrared release in general, this is a special function in the camera and NOT another shutter release.  For instance, you cannot program a bracketed shot and release it with the infrared remote.  Neither can you release the bracketed shot with the self-timer; it is another special function that works on a single shot only, like the infrared release.  Finally, a cabled release is not available for this camera, making it unsuitable for advanced photographic techniques like astrophotography, time-lapse photography, or gigapixel panorama photography.I've also experimented with higher ISO settings to overcome the above-mentioned remote-release problems and thus use the camera for twilight and sunrise/sunset photography.  I found that noise is a serious problem in RAW images over 400 ISO.  The camera programming does a decent job of eliminating JPG noise without noticeable effect up to 1600 ISO, but you've already lost image details if you are forced to use JPG images for post-processing work.  At 3200 ISO and above, even JPG images lose sharpness, as the noise reduction algorithm has trouble distinguishing image pixel data from noise.Concerning customer service, I've written a third message to SONY customer service, asking if there are any options that SONY can suggest, or that SONY has in development, that can make the NEX-7 suitable for bracketed low-light photography and perhaps compatible with specialized photographic equipment.  Besides an automated acknowledgement, there has been silence since November 2013.

Well after two days of using the NEX-7 I \"delisted\" my X-100 (thankfully no one had bid on it) and telephoned Sony for an RMA number.  For although the NEX-7 looks good on paper, is very quality, and has generated unequivocally positive reviews, it suffered from three fatal flaws as far as I'm concerned:  1) Despite being generally high-quality, the EVF viewfinder -- as is the case with all the EVF finders I have used so far -- is virtually as useless as LCD finders on sunny days on the water.  Since I take about 50% of my photos on cruises or during yacht races, this makes the NEX-7 unacceptable for my needs.  The X-100 on the other hand has a superb optical finder (as well as a decent EVF) that comes into its own under these circumstances.  2) Most of the remaining 50% of my photos are candid indoor or evening available light candids; and I hate to have to use a flash with these.  Here, the slow speed of the \"kit\" zoom made these shots murky and hard to discern details; especially when compared with the superb results of the X-100 under these same conditions.  I had  the fast 24mm and 50mm lenses on order, but they aren't expected to be available in quantity until the end of the month.  And, even then I'll have spent about twice the price of the X-100 to match what the X-100 offers in low-light conditions right now.  Also, the resolution of the NEX-7 kit zoom doesn't hold a candle to the X-100's resolving power; especially in the corners of 8x10's that I printed last night.  3)  From the size standpoint, the NEX-7 with any of its lenses is about twice the depth of the X-100; and this renders several of the small cases and gadget bags that easily fit the X-100, totally useless.  The best example is the Sun Sniper SnapR which is my favorite X-100 carrying device since it combines a sling & a case in one integrated package.  Unfortunately the NEX-7 will never be able to fit into it or similiarly-sized cases until Sony releases a pancake lens with the resolving power and focal length of the X-100's.For all of these reasons, if you're addicted to always have the \"latest and greatest\" camera, I'd recommend staying with the X-100 for now.  And similarly, if you're looking for a truly high-quality \"king of the hill,\" despite its quirks, I'd say that for now I think the X-100 is still on top and is likely to be for some time if you don't want to spend more than $1400 and if resolving power, low light performance and suitability for composing photos in extremely bright shooting conditions are among your priorities.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "video - one star, stills - five stars", "Author": "H.

The lower weight of the camera(approximately one half weight of regular DSLR cameras)make this a terrific choice for the photographer on the run,in field or city.The very high 24.3 megapixel, provide astonishing clarity. This makes more than impressive enlargements.The high resolution is staggering.It compares to my more expensive Nikon DSLR.It is suitable for interchangeable lenses,although it comes with one-18-55mm lense.The real time camera adjustments in the OLED viewfinder are easy to read.I especially enjoy the wheel movement that take picture speed to amazing heights,making it easy to shoot great pictures in any indoor light.The 10 fps shooting speeds allow one to capture sports ,running children ,flying birds etc.It is that up to snuff.I love the three dial Tri- Navi control dials that make changing settings easy to navigate,and clear to read. They set ISO as well as exposure compensation.I immediately found all the features easy to learn,and navigate.The HD video has low noise,and the clarity is beautiful.I manually adjust the lense, and it also works well on the low light settings. One might use the shoe for a better microphone depending on the need at hand.It has MP4 codec for uploading easily to the web in a smaller file size. The AVCHD codec provides full size video in impressive HD.The camera body is tough and feels great in the hand.The versatility and sophistication of this camera has enticed me to use it more than my larger cameras-including for photographing my art work.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great 4/3 camera", "Author": "Edward A.

I bought the kit lens and the 50 1.8 one. The camera is a lot of fun to use. Loaded with features, fast, responsive, good built quality of the camera and lenses. However, after using the camera for a week, i was disappointed with the image quality. It gets worse if you're shooting indoors under low light. Some point and shoot cameras produce better images. I really really liked using this camera and I really wanted to keep it, however the image quality is unacceptable for such a camera. I'll either continue using my point and shoot camera (canon s100),  or get a nikon or canon dslr..N.B. I only shot jpeg's, did not shoot raw. However, i'ver shot with a canon xsi for 3 years with only jpeg's, and the canon's image quality is DEFINITELY better than this.Now I went back to sony and I bought the nex 6. I also got the zeiss 24 mm lens, and I'm using nikon lenses with adaptor. The results are great. So I think either 24 megapixel on the nex 7 is too much for APS-C sensor ( but i don't that's true because my nikon d3200 takes great pics and is 24 MP), or the available NEX lenses are not good enough for the nex 7's sensor, but good for a 16 MP sensor like the Nex ^6", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Recently over-priced by an $100.", "Author": "Noel A.
