Thee's nothing about DC15 in google. After 4 days of googling I found the official website [...]the funniest part is that there's no DC15 even there ))3. Customer Service sux. I mailed them twice about the DC15 pdf manual. After 3 days some idiot replied with attached DC14s(not DC15) pdf file and told to call some number in case if I had any other questions (not that's what I call a customer service).4. Camera is absolutely terrible.  -Image is grainy and blurred.  -You can't shoot in the room with lights on.  -Battery dies in 1 hour.I strongly not recommend do buy it!p.s. The only good thing about this camera is that it looks nice and the plastic is not cheap. Oh and it shipped right on time ))", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$25.00", "Features": "Stores 100 pictures", "Name": "Slick Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31NrpZuANDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005L4WINW"}}
