While MMC cards are not the primary medium of storage in this country, they are the primary source of storage for these devices in Europe. In fact, most high end European devices using digital storage mediums use MMC cards. Yes, they are currently more expensive byte per byte than some other storage mediums but they are also significantly smaller.  They are also the fastest growing storage medium in this market.  I currently have a mp3 player, a digital camera and a motion activated security device that all use the same MMC storage technology. Figure about a buck per megabyte.  Kodak made a savvy move using the MMC storage medium. They are hoping to challenge current European/Japanese offerings by using a storage medium currently popular in Europe  combined with a camera that takes superb pictures.  The \"kicker\" is the Kodak docking station. No matter how inept the computerphobe, once installed to a USB port, photo manipulation becomes as simple as dropping off 35mm film to a one hour developer. The docking station charges the battery while a single push of the button downloads the photos to the computer for manipulation, printing, emailing or whatever.  Kodak offers some truly impressive printing technology whether or not you use their cameras.  Controls are easy to use but like most digital technology, the number of control decisions offered are overwhelming unless one has a week or two to spend learning all of the potential permutations.  Unlike film formats, bad pictures from digital cameras can be erased by the push of a button with no more expense than the cost of the electricity to record. Why digital cameras (Including this Kodak) offer so many different photo modes when it is just as easy to take a ton of pictures that can be later manipulated on a computer still confuses me  Bottom line, the camera fits nicely into most hands- neither too big or too small, the controls are easy to understand and use, the camera takes great pictures and computer manipultation using the docking station is a breeze.  Downsides are the Kodak name which is typically connected with low end(read quality) camera products (unless one is in the medical industry where their products have no peers), the use of MMC cards which are more expensive than than comparable storage mediums, and the ever present debate that compares digital to 35mm film cameras.  If you get past these issues, you still might find that this is not a great but a pretty good camera for the money. The docking station pushes it over the edge for the computer challenged.", "Date": "November 25, 2001"}, {"Title": "Beware -- two defective cameras in a row!", "Author": "Douglas Johnson", "ReviewID": "R394CFUN5U6IAL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Warning -- don't order a Kodak DX-3700 unless you're prepared for shoddy workmanship and non-existent customer service from Kodak.After considerable research, including reviewing some favorable reviews of the DX-3700 posted on this site, on December 24 2001 I  ordered a DX-3700 digital camera as a Christmas gift for my wife.  Unfortunately, the camera had the following defects:  (1) It did not display the status of its settings, battery charge, etc., when it is turned on in the \"capture\" mode, as it should according to page 4 of the operator's manual.  (2)It did not display its settings when the \"select\" button is pressed in the \"capture\" mode, as it should according to page 7 of the operator's manual.  In other words, you could not tell what settings the camera was on, how much charge was left in the battery, etc.  (3)  When placedon Kodak's recharging dock and with Kodak's rechargeable battery, the dockdisplayed a flashing red light and the camera would not charge.  Thinking I'd just had the bad luck to get a defective unit, I got permission to return the camera was shipped another DX-3700 as a replacement.  Most disappointingly, the replacementcamera ALSO has defects no. 1 and 2 as described above.  In addition, the replacement camera, while producing a green light on the Kodak docking/charging station, did not really charge properly, so that even after days of charging, itfailed after taking only THREE photos.In addition, there were various time-consuming problems with the Kodak computer software that I won't go into here, except to say that when I went to the Kodak website for help I found a mess.  Supposed links to fixes for defects in the Windows \"firmware\" for the DX-3700 instead led to MacIntosh files, and so forth.  During this entire time-consuming struggle with these two defective Kodak cameras, despite numerous attempts, NEVER ONCE was I able to get through to anybody on the Kodak 1-800 hotline, 800-235-6325, listed in the owner's manual.  From morning to night, calls to this \"hotline\" receive a recording greeting, followed by a BUSY SIGNAL.  I am giving up on Kodak products for good.

Lee Jr.", "ReviewID": "R18OM69WAQZKCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a Kodak dx3700 camera for Xmas for my extremely non-technical wife (no docking station). After reading countless reviews and visiting manufacturer websites, I decided on a Kodak Easyshare Camera. I originally wanted the dx3600 because it had an optical zoom lens. Unfortunately, due to lack of supply and time frame, I had to get to the dx3700 in order to have a gift under the tree. This was my 1st digital purchase.  Ease of use and picture quality were my main concerns because we will primarily print the photos.To my surprise, the ease of taking photos and downloading photos was EXCEPTIONAL!!! I was even surprised that the photos had a date/time stamp and downloaded pictures were automatically categorized into new folders by date (GREAT FEATURE!). In regards to ease of use, THERE IS NOTHING BETTER! Literally, after 10 minutes, we were taking photos and making prints. We were all impressed.  However, we had nothing to compare the picture quality to. My wife was also hesitant to let me know that she would have liked a zoom lens.I began to research \"comparable\" cameras with zoom lenses. After thinking about upgrading to a dx3900, I decided to try another brand. I already knew Kodak's picture quality because the dx3900 is basically a dx3700 with 2x zoom.After reading many more reviews and evaluating pros & cons, I decided to try the Canon A20.  It was \"only\" 2.1 Megapixels, but it had a 3x zoom and looked like a Point & Shoot. Unfortunately, it did not have a date/time stamp. I purchased one from a retail store knowing that I would return it and buy it much cheaper online. I unpacked it.  I immediately noticed that it required 4 AA batteries.  The Kodak required only 1 Lithium or 2 AA Ni-MH. The Canon was MUCH more difficult to set up.  Kodak had spoiled me.  Canon's camera interface and software installation were MUCH more complex. I became nervous because I thought it would be to complicated for my wife to enjoy. I completed all setups. I had her hold the Canon and Kodak, then take some identical pictures with both cameras using the zoom and different settings indoors (where most of her pictures would be taken anyway). I printed them, then gave her a \"Pepsi Challenge\".All of the pictures that she preferred were from the 2.1MP Canon, not the 3.1MP Kodak.  The Kodak's were not bad. The Canon's were just better. Contrary to what I would have thought (being a digital novice), she was right. Although Canon's \"ease of use\" was definitely inferior to Kodak's, it had superior picture quality and a 3x optical zoom (remember: the dx3900 only had a 2x zoom). Although we LOVED Kodak's simplicity, we had to opt for picture quality. Although there will be a greater learning curve, picture quality lasts forever (If I can only get her to truly believe that).I returned the Kodak, and ordered the Canon A20 online.  I was even able to get the Canon for less than a dx3900. Although I will really miss Kodak's simplicity, every time I look at a printed photo, I will know that I made the right decision. I only hope that battery drain will not be too much of a nuisance.", "Date": "December 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Trap! This camera uses a universally incompatible card!", "Author": "H.

The 3700 uses an SD or MMC card that is hard to find.  Once you find them in some retail stores, they cost 3 times more than their CF counterparts.  SD or MMC are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization, yet this camera is bigger than Kodak 3900, an excellent camera that uses CF card.  Therefore, this card format doesn't make any sense.  Another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the SD card is 64 MB as compared with 512 MB for CF card. Since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution, I tried to order a 64 MB SD card...  The price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more.

Another annoyance is the LCD viewer.  Once you press the button to take the photo, the LCD blacks out so you can't see what you're trying to shoot.  Since there isn't an optical zoom, you have to use the viewfinder and can't tell if the \"zoomed\" shot is centered or not.I returned this camera and chose another product (Nikon CoolPix 775) for the same price that includes the docking station, several other helpful features and an MP3 feature as well.", "Date": "January 13, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera For EveryDay Users.......", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2UTBSPPHEPK8I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I liked in this camera most, is the user-friendly functions, it's very easy to change settings and to Review your Albums while on the road, and the picture Quality is Super.As for the memory I got me the 64 Mb MMC card which is more than enough if you are thinking of Sending emails \" thats 200+ pic\" and 92 pictures for the highest resolution \" Equals 2* 36 films on the old cameras\" as for the Cons: don't Repeat my mistake by not buying the Optional Easyshare Dock, because this Extra item will Help you Recharge the batteries that comes with the camera Box and they will live alot longer than the Standard AA Batteries \" which Bring us to the Last part of the Cons\": this baby Eats Batteries Like Popcorn, so make sure you got the Dock or atleast A Recharger For this Digital Camera...", "Date": "February 28, 2002"}, {"Title": "For the price, a quality camera", "Author": "Mich\u00e8le et Pete", "ReviewID": "R3UH27JFWPGIRP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Docking station:  You don't need a docking station for this camera.  We don't have one, and we still enjoy this camera.  We use a regular wall-plug battery recharger that works just as well for the batteries.  Save yourself the extra money, and just keep the USB cable on your desk--plugs right into the camera, and you can upload your pictures quickly.Picture quality: First rate.  We print the photos out on photo-quality paper, and they look about as good as with a \"regular\" camera.  Ease of operation: The camera is easy to use.  There are a few downsides, though:(1) On/Off and flash buttons are tiny for grownup fingers;(2) Regardless of light, there is a 1 or 2 second delay from shutter release to actual picture being taken--if you are taking action pictures, this will be a hinderance;(3) There is a short delay for every button you press (you never know if you need to press it again, or if the camera is just processing the request--you may need to press the On/Off button several times, for example, before it does what you want).Convenience: Uploading is easy.  Taking pictures is easy.  The included Kodak software also makes saving & sending the photos easy.Battery life: This is the weakest aspect of the camera.  Instructions say you should get 300 pictures from the batteries.  We don't, we get maybe half that. The quirky thing is, when you upload your pictures from the camera to your PC, a little message comes on the screen that says \"Battery level is good,\" but the camera batteries die next time you take pictures.Overall: We got this camera to photograph our newborn and save/send relatives the photos as easily as possible.  It has met that need, and exceeded our expectations of photo quality.  Kodak just needs to make the buttons bigger and more responsive.

Prince \"princeamir\"", "ReviewID": "R39L65LCQSA4RQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After doing much research on which camera was right for me, I chose this Kodak DX3700 based on the amount of megapixels and the great price. A friend of mine has a Kodak DC3400 2 megapixel camera that takes great pics, so I thought this one would be even better. What a mistake!This is my second digital camera. My first was a Canon A5 (quite a dinosaur now!). I was considering another Canon, but I was lured into the price of this one....At first I was pretty pleased with it. The menu is very simple. All of the settings, pretty much, only require a \"yes or no\" answer. This was much more simple than some of the settings on my Canon.I'm not very pleased with the pictures themselves, though. The redeye reduction is HORRIBLE. Both of my sons look posessed in most of the pictures I take. Their eyes glow this BRIGHT, VIBRANT RED. To the point that they can't even be corrected with software. The pictures aren't always clear. The color, if the lighting isn't ideal, sometimes tends to look a bit \"blah\". Even on my old 1mp Canon, I could still get these bright, lucious colors! With this one, the colors almost look like they bleed together sometimes.The batteries are another issue. I was pretty pleased with the battery that came with the camera. It lasted for a very signifigant amount of time (maybe 2 or 3 months with fairly frequent use). But once those died, I tried some regular alkalines. These were/are a joke. I maybe got 2 weeks use out of them. And I'm not much of an LCD viewer myself, so I know that wasn't sucking the life out of them. The 8 meg Compact Flash card the ship with the camera is an absolute JOKE. If you get this camera, be prepared to spend [more money] on a new compact flash card. Just go ahead and thow it in your amazon.com cart and add it to the total price of the camera! And while you're at it, you might also consider throwing in the rechargable batteries and the charger, because you'll spend a small fortune if you want to use regular AA's. As I said in the beginning of this review, I am very disappointed in this camera. Unfortunately, it took me almost 2 months to come to the realization that I had made a mistake when I purchased it. Now I am stuck with it. I do not recommend it. I feel that I would've been better off getting a high rated 2 megapixel camera. Unless you're willing to spend the extra cash for a good 4 MP, the 3 MP isn't worth the extra cash. A 4 MP camera is almost the equivilant (sp?) of a 35mm anyways. So a 3.1 mp is still shy of that goal. Good luck in choosing! I think mine might end up finding it's way to an auction site.

A few KMarts in our area are closing their doors, and all of their digital cameras, docks, and supplies were 40% off!  I snapped up the camera and dock as quickly as I could.  This being my first digital camera, I have to say I'm satisfied overall.  The only thing I'll be using the camera for is basic point and shoot photography and maybe a little bit of photo manipulation and maybe a little emailing. The 3700 meets all of my needs, so I'm happy.I was dissapointed though with a few things... first the memory card.  KMart was out of cards so I went to circuit city instead to buy one.  I told the salesperson what model camera I had and he sold me the Compact Flash card instead of the MMC card.  I arrived home excited to play with my new toy, and I had to drive 25 minutes back to the store to get a new memory card that was $25.00 more expensive!  Annoying to say the least.  Also, the dock I purchased was missing the rechargable batteries.  That kind of [angered] me...  But I figured since I got the dock for 40% off that I could spend the $$ I saved on batteries anyway.  I called Kodak to inform them of the missing product and there was nothing they could do to help me.  Some customer service they have!  Also, the dock was the last one KMart had in stock and it was being sold as is simply because they were going out of buisness.  So, I was kind of up a creek with this battery situation.  In defense of the dock, however, I have to say that the one touch downloading is GREAT!  I love the convenience.  The software is decent... after working with programs like Photoshop, the Kodak software pales in comparison as far as options go.  But for basic manipulation, it's not bad.Overall, I'm liking my new digital camera.  At 40% off, it wasn't a bad deal at all considering I purchased the dock and camera for the total of the regularly priced camera itself.  If I were to buy again, I might consider the 3900 to have the convenience of more options.", "Date": "April 28, 2002"}, {"Title": "easyuse", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1F4YMQA07331A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this camera if fun and easy for those of us who have kids and is not available to use the computer often enough to do the downloading and figuring out the software.

Some people will tell you that this is a moderately good beginner's camera, but I must state the contrary: This camera will leave even beginners frustrated.The DX3700 is slow in every sense of the word. You're forced to wait after every action on this camera-turning it on, switiching the mode, after taking a picture-if you plan on taking more than 1 picture every 15-20 seconds this camera isn't going to deliver. This slowness also directly influences......battery life. There is none. Of any device I've used, this one is the most power-hungry. Even rechargeable NiMH batteries last for only brief periods after which you're rudely interrupted with a blinking red light-and no forewarning of the impending power failure. Make sure you're ready to take the same picture twice.Every single picture taken on this camera is laced with a grain/noise/fuzz that will never go away no matter what you do. While snapshots and just everyday pictures may not yield too much noticeable noise, any kind of detailed shots-macros, notably-will look terrible. Almost none of the camera's settings can be changed. Focus, exposure, focal length, white balance, and anything else short of the flash type and macro mode (on or off) are automatic. Meaning? Make sure you're ready to take the same picture twice (or more, for that matter.)In short, don't buy this camera unless you want headaches and frustration.

If only I had checked reviews like these I could have saved myself much frustration. One stopgap suggestion: if you take pictures indoors, always have the recharging cradle nearby so you can recharge each time it runs down. Another criticism I have is the small size of the camera (which might be common among low end digitals) and the correspondingly small operating buttons, which would be perfect for tots or elves but for grownups, even for someone with small hands like mine, it's a challenge.

We tried rechargeable batteries, but the problems did not resolve. We thought it might be the camera dock and tried at a friend's house, but the problem still did not resolve.
