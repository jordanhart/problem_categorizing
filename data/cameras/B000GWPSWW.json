I spent a few days researching cameras within my budget, and my mom had an HP and she liked it, so I decided to try it. I love it. Its so simple to use, the software is easy to install and easy to use once you try to transfer your pics from the camera to computer. I have not yet tried to print a pic, but everything else about the camera is wonderful.Its small and fits in your hand, the zoom is decent, the picture quality changes when you use max zoom, but the pics still come out pretty good. The only feature I dont like as much is that when you are looking through the LCD display, when you move the camera, its a little blurry and doesnt focus right away. Everything else is wonderful and I am very very happy with my camera!", "Date": "December 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Better then I expected..", "Author": "Ari M. \"Ari\"", "ReviewID": "R12YZ7A3G4WNMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actual bought this for my 15 year old niece, got it for just over $100 @ circuit city. I gotta say so far I'm impressed, it take's great pictures, can zoom in before/after picture taking, and has audio/video capability's as well as web cam. Now I have a Canon Powershot A75, which I love, and has more ability's then this camera, but for the price and if your new to digital I would recommend.", "Date": "December 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good for someone who just needs a camera", "Author": "Vanilla Bean", "ReviewID": "R3H51SKEHASXUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a good valued digital camera for the summer that was good quality but affordable.  This is what I found.  My brother has an older version of it, that is 5mp.  There are some changes, one being that this one automatically shuts off if you leave the camera open (which means leaving it on with this camera) whereas in the old one it ran down the batteries.Disadvantages: -Digital zoom stinks.  As Kim Commando has said, it's like fake zoom.  If you want close up shots for concerts, sports, or other things, this is NOT the camera for you, you need one with optical zoom.  If you zoom much with this thing you just get a blurry, grainy picture that looks like a photomosaic.  -The software that you use to get the pics off of the camera onto the pc also did not impress me.  It wasn't the easiest to use, and it wouldn't let me do some of the things I thought it should. -Whenever you turn it off, it resets all of the flash and camera settings.  So if you want the flash off you have to keep turning it off.  This can be annoying, but it hasn't made me want to stick the camera in a garbage disposal yet.Other than that, it's good for shots of friends or family, or scenery that can be good from a distance.  It has many flash options and shutter control options.I suggest investing in the following two things also with this camera:1. A 2 GB memory card, this way with Best Quality you can hold more than enough photos.2. Rechargeable AA batteries.  You can get these with the charger at Wal-mart for less than $15, and it will save a fortune on batteries.  I got a 2-hour charger, so when my batteries run down, all I have to do is charge them for less than 2 hours.  It is very convenient and pays off.You may want to get a case too.  The slidey front that makes it go on and off can be annoying.  I have to stick it in my pocket a certain way.Good for someone who wants an easy way to keep memories.  I'm so glad I invested in this camera, and can keep pictures on cd, computer, or whatever easily, and easily get rid of the ones that I don't want.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Novice or Casual", "Author": "Edward Edwards", "ReviewID": "R3JB5J9RL2CNIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect for a novice or casual photographer.

I will agree that the zoom on this camera is nearly non-existent, when you use it the photos turn out extremely grainy. Therefore, if you plan on taking pictures where you know you need a good zoom feature, invest in a better camera. For only $100, this camera is a great deal. The pictures turn out clear on the display, computer, and in print. It's a good choice for a casual photographer who is more concerned about capturing regular, everyday \"Kodak moments\" rather than a professional photographer, and should be judged as such.I will also add that last 4th of July I used this camera to take pictures of the fireworks we set off, and those pictures turned out AMAZING. It does have a lot of features to take quality pictures if you play around with it.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R46TCZ9XV86IW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my 12 year old daughter and she just loves it, the 5 times zoom the 6MP for the price of 95.99 its just perfect.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R3HM0Z4QNBBDTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this HP Photosmart E427 camera from a chain store as part of a bundle with a laptop and printer, probably would have never bought this camera by itself.  I was very surprised by the quality of the photos.  Pictures look good on the LCD screen, on the computer screen, and the prints looked as good as anything I have ever got with my old 35mm camera.  There is no optical zoom, and the digital zoom only goes so far before it looks grainy, but overall, I am quite satisfied.  It is pretty small, fits inside a jacket pocket easily.  Just be careful not to accidently slide the lens cover open when it's in a pocket (it turns the camera on) and, of course as with all digital cameras now, don't break the LCD screen.  The LCD screen is smaller than most other cameras, but still does its job nicely.  I find myself carrying this around all day in my purse now, it's so convenient. Great camera for casual snapshots.", "Date": "October 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Horrible product support", "Author": "Stephen Clary", "ReviewID": "R3TVGP4WKDOTCM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter. It worked okay (my only complaint is that there is no audio playback for the audio, and the audio sounded really bad when played back on a computer). But then my daughter lost the battery door that covers the batteries and SD memory slots. It's just a little plastic slide in door...probably costs $0.01 to produce. But after spending many hours wasting time with HP's horrible customer support I now know that they will not sell me the part at any price. So my $80 camera is nearly worthless (yeah, we can use scotch tape to hold the batteries in). Anyway, the door is prone to fall off and get lost and HP isn't interested in solving the problem because there isn't enough $$$ in it for them.

I knew the moment I took it out of the packaging and held it in my hands. It feels like it could break any moment.

The 5x optical zoom it has is the ONLY zoom in the camera.It was extremely difficult to get a photo that was not blurry out of this thing.It is cheap for a digital camera, but  worth only $20 in terms of quality.
