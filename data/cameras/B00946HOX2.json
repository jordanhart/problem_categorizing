Remember to get a polarfilter, it will fit both lenses.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "I bought the 5r", "Author": "O.

I wish I got the 6 or the 7 since they have the built in viewfinder and flash, but it isn't a huge deal breaker for me.The proprietary port accessories are QUITE expensive, so I don't see myself buying the nicer flash or viewfinder any time soon.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pro features, easy to use.", "Author": "pat o'fallon", "ReviewID": "ROTBY1R0VH4CI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying this camera, I must have read a hundred different reviews. Most of them sounded like the reviewer was disappointed in the camera and it's features. Well, I bought the camera about a week ago and I'm having a hard time understanding all the negativity.The kit I purchased was generous in it's value for what I spent and the camera arrived in a couple of days. The cameras construction is solid, not as plastic as I thought it might be. It's compact enough to slip into a jacket pocket and carry around without any inconvenience. The controls are easy to understand and with a little study, easy to use. The picture quality is unbelievable. I've taken outdoor pictures at night in intelligent mode that look professional and I am a complete novice. I bought this camera for my wife who has an eye for photos but knows nothing about photography, she loves it. This is a pro quality camera that is suitable for the point and shoot photographer. The videos are clear and in focus and easy to take. All said this was a great purchase and I would recommend the camera to anyone who wants to take better pictures. A great value and an excellent piece of equipment.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "NEX-5R", "Author": "Zong", "ReviewID": "R1G34JFSRIW7N8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleased with this item, Nex-5R.

Camera is great, and the telephoto is new as far as I can tell, comes in the original box. Everything else is kinda cheap, but honestly, I just bought it because it was the best deal I could get with the telephoto.
