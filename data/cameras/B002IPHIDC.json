{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Pocket Camera With A Little Tinkering", "Author": "Culture Shlock", "ReviewID": "R1HA7K75ZA45O9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was probably a month or two ago that I saw some press releases on a new point and shoot Sony had coming out, the WX1, which intrigued me. Like a lot of photo enthusiasts, while a DSLR is the weapon of choice, the elusive holy grail seems to be a small point and shoot camera that can slip in your pocket so you can be packing at all times, yet would still take good looking photos that are not so riddled with noise (a problem almost always plaguing point and shoots because of their small sensors) that they look like your tv screen when the test pattern has gone off. As the old adage goes, the best camera is the one you have on you when you need it and a DSLR is a little tough to integrate into your daily accessories.So in evaluating this camera, perspective is required. This is not the camera you would go to for your best work. It is not the same package of everything you have with your DSLR and collection of lenses shrunk down to something the size of a couple of packs of gum. It is a tiny point and shoot camera that easily slips into your pocket with room to spare that does way better than the average point and shoot. In other words, it's a top performer for the junior varsity but its not ready to hang with the varsity.Here's the reasons I wanted one:1. I wanted a small camera I could keep in my pocket for daily use. What a lot of photographers call a \"street shooter\", something you can pull out and use to grab shots of whatever you happen to run into during your day.This camera is certainly small. I've seen a few people refer to it as \"chunky\" and they must consider Ellen Page to be fat. This is tiny. I was surprised at how small the box it came in was, and even more surprised when I found the camera in the small box. My first impression was it wasn't much bigger than one of those old minolta spy cameras. My previous point and shoot camera was the Sony W300, which most people considered slim and stylish, and this camera is smaller in all respects than that. Side by side the WX1 seems slight smaller than the W300, but looking at it alone it looks like a tiny toy camera. I gave the W300 to my wife, and when she caught a view of the WX1 her reaction was \"But yours is so much smaller.\" She was thrilled when I gave her the W300 but now has taken to calling it a hand me down. I went from hero to goat. As they say, size matters.2. Stealth factor - I wanted a camera that I could sneak into places that don't allow cameras.You could drop this baby into the front pocket of your levis and still have room for a decent game of pocket pool. I can easily get it, a wallet and even a cell phone all in the front pocket of my jeans. Alone in the pocket, it scarcely makes even a bump that a security guard might notice.3. Low light capabilities - I dislike using a flash and wanted something that could take good pictures in natural light, and could function well in dark places.The low light capabilities of this camera are astonishing. The camera can basically see better in the dark then you can. Lots of the pictures I took in dark rooms look way more illuminated in the photos then they were in reality.Because it seemed to be everything I had been searching for in a point and shoot, I went ahead and ordered this as soon as Amazon had them available. Because they were not yet widely available, there were no hands on reviews by the usual photography sites and blogs. While waiting to get the camera, I would check Amazon every day to see if anyone who had actually used the camera had put up any reviews yet. The initial few reviews were alarming. People who said they wanted to love the camera didn't. The gist of their complaints seemed to be that the camera took good pictures in low light (although a few didn't even agree with that) and crappy pictures in good light. Sample photos that people began posting on Flickr also didn't look too hot. Because of this I regretted ordering the camera so quickly and almost just sent it back to Amazon without even opening the box.I decided to try it for myself before deciding whether to send it back, and found it to be much better than the initial reviews had painted it (and subsequent reviews on Amazon now seem to be swinging towards the positive).I do have to agree that a lot of the shots I've taken outdoors in bright sunlight seem a little overexposed and dull, but I've also had this problem with my Canon DSLRs when set on automatic. In any case, I've found that with the WX1, all you have to do is open the photo in Photoshop and click \"Auto Contrast\" and the problem is instantly corrected. A reviewer on Amazon has also noted that you can get more vivid, warm outdoors photos from the WX1 by using the Program mode and moving the White Balance setting from Auto to Flash. I tried this, and with the White Balance set to Flash the pictures basically look the same out of the camera as they do after I've run them through Photoshop and hit Auto Contrast. Another user mentioned in some of his posts that turning off the DRO in the menu greatly improves outdoor photos.The argument that most people just want nice looking snapshots right out of the camera and don't want to mess with Photoshop is valid, but those are probably not the people who are going to be interested in this camera anyway. The camera's not cheap and those people would be very happy with the snapshots they could get with an inexpensive entry level point and shoot.In any event, after a couple of weeks with the camera, my recommendation for everyday daylight shots is not to use the Intelligent Auto mode, but rather put the camera in the \"P\" or program mode. This will allow you to fix the ISO at 160, which is fine 90% of the time. Decrease the EV setting by .07. Most shots will now come out great. If you want warmer colors put the white balance on Flash, or increase the saturation a little after the fact in Photoshop. As noted above, turning off the DRO also seems to help.As for claims that the WX1 photos come out noisy, I don't agree. Even the low light pictures don't seem to have a noise problem. This is not to say they are DSLR quality, but they don't look bad at all for a point and shoot.Other positives:4. A nice 24mm wide angle lens, which lets you get very close to things and is also great for cramped indoor settings, buildings and landscapes. Speaking of getting close to things, the macro feature springs into gear automatically when you stick the camera within an inch or two of an object.5. Fast on, little lag time between shots unless you're using the Burst, Panoramic, Anti-Blur or hand held Twilight modes which take a little time to process.6. HD Video. I never really use this but nice to have in case I ever catch the You Tube bug.7. Panoramic mode. In this mode simply press the shutter and sweep your arm and the camera creates a panorama all by itself. You don't have to take a bunch of single shots and try to stitch them together later with a photo program. The only drawback is that it sets the exposure for the area you start, which can make it difficult to get a good one in uneven lighting.8. Battery life seems pretty good.So what's not to like about this camera?1. No manual controls.The W300 had full manual controls, and I wonder why Sony couldn't have included them here and really made this a top of the line point and shoot. Many serious amateur photographers who would otherwise love this camera won't even consider it because it doesn't allow them the ability to manually control aperture, shutter speed, etc. This, along with the lack of RAW capabilities, will probably keep this camera from competing with the Panasonic LX3 and upcoming Canon S90.As note above, there is a limited work around. Using the Program (as opposed to Automatic) Mode allows you to set the ISO between 160 and 3200, which will force the camera to use a slower or faster shutter speed. You should note that if the DRO is on, you can't use a ISO higher than 800. Turn it off if you want to go higher. You can also put the camera in High ISO mode, which allows for faster shutter speed.Canon's soon to be released S90 seems to have become the great new hope for shutterbugs longing for a small point and shoot that takes great low light photos instead of the WX1, primarily because it not only also has a fast lens and improved sensor, but also manual controls and raw capabilities.2. No viewfinder.I read somewhere this morning that 25% - soon to be a third - of the population are aging baby boomers. If they're anything like me, they have a hard time reading a restaurant menu in dim light, or for that matter anything else a few feet from their face without reading glasses. Translated to small point and shoot cameras, it's almost impossible for an older pair of eyes to clearly see what's on a 2.7 or 3 inch LCD screen on the back of camera, even if bright sun isn't washing out the screen. Most of the time with the WX1 I really can't make out what's on the screen, because to me its all out of focus (the problem is my eyes, not the camera). I just have to sort of aim the camera in the direction I want and estimate the framing and have faith. The W300 had a viewfinder, which was why I bought it. Sure wish this one did too, even if they had to make the camera a little bigger.3. Mediocre zoom.The WX1 has a 5x zoom, which would seem to be better than the standard 3x zoom found on a typical point and shoot. In practice, because this camera has such a wide angle lens to start with, zooming out 5x doesn't seem to get you any closer than a 3x zoom on a point and shoot without a wide angle lens. In short, this camera won't get you close to far away objects, you'll have to use your feet. It also seems to me that when you max out the zoom at 5x the photos get a little soft.4. Beware of moving objects.The low light modes are great for stationary objects, but in some of the shots I took where people were walking they blurred.With the camera set in Program mode I ran after the dogs and couldn't get a single shot that wasn't too blurred to be any good, except when I had it in burst mode. I would expect it would be the same for parents chasing their kids (mine are in their 20's and won't run from me anymore, so I can't test this).The camera supposedly has Motion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection, which in Intelligent Auto mode supposedly adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. It also has a pet mode which is suppose to do the same thing for things that move on four legs. Maybe I wasn't doing it right but they didn't seem to help much.The best bet for action and fast moving subjects with this camera seems to be the burst mode, which rips off 10 shots one after another when the shutter is pressed. I didn't get a chance to test this at a little league game or AYSO tournament, but I did finally get a couple of stop action shots of the dog with it. If you could control the shutter (which you can't) you might be able to get this camera to better stop action. On the other hand a recent review of the upcoming S90 indicated that even with a fast lens and manual controls (allowing you to set the shutter) it wasn't fast enough for action, sports and kids. I guess we have to face facts. At the current state of the art, no point and shoot camera is going to do a great job in this area.All in all its a cool little camera which does things most point and shoots don't and also doesn't do things most point and shoots don't. In case you're wondering, it never went back to Amazon although I do wonder if I might regret not having waited for the Canon S90 when that arrives.You can find some test shots I took here: [...]", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've had so far", "Author": "John S. Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z7RR5X0WBHX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking at this last month when it was announced, and had decided I was going to go with the forthcoming 980 from Canon.  My last four digital cameras were all Canon, and i was happy with them.  But the more I dug and waited, the more I saw that there were things on this one I was hoping would make a difference, since many of my shots are indoors with my 5 year old, and the lower light benefits of this camera may make a difference.I was getting tired of the grainy blacks indoors even with good light on automatic settings...  They looked better if I manually set the ISO, but if I'm just pulling it out for a quick shot, i don't want to have to remember to go to manual settings all the time.  This is replacing a Canon Powershot SD40 Elph that I liked very much other than the grainy blacks...So I thought I'd take a chance.  The smile shutter may be useful with a 5 year old, the panorama mode looked pretty slick, battery life was more than acceptable compared to my SD40.  I liked the thin form factor even if it is a little larger the other two dimensions.  And the 3 inch touch screen would be a very nice upgrade from my tiny 1.2 or so inch on the canon.Since the big thing I was looking for was better indoor pictures with lower light and less grainy blacks, that was the first set of shots I took.  I had both cameras in my hands, one on top, one below.  Took shots at the same time from the same distances with the same lighting, both left on automatic.  I know I can always get into manual modes to compensate for things, but I wanted something I didn't always have to do that with.  And this low light boasting on the TX1 had me curious.Got the pictures onto my computer, loaded them side by side, and dang if every single picture I took was not GREATLY improved with the Sony compared to my older Canon.  The blacks were black, not grainy grey.  The details were better (makes sense since it's 3 MP more than mine) but the clarity of even far away things that weren't in focus was astounding.I have played with a family member's 900 version of the TX, and while it took good pictures, I didn't see that much difference between those and my older SD40.  So this one is definitely a notable improvement even over newer Sony cameras.The 10 shots per second is amazing - and they are great shots, not like they dropped in quality to get them so fast.  panorama is cool, but I need to work on the speed to get the best speed it needs, since mine so far have a spot in most of them where it gets a little fuzzy, probably where my speed changed.  Not very noticeable, but there nonetheless until I can figure out my panning method.Video i'll want to wait till tomorrow to test out more, as it's moving into evening here, indoor light is very very low.  Video still looked much brighter in the viewscreen and on replay than it really was when recorded, so you can see the power of the light gathering in everything you do with the camera.  But it was blurry when panning a bit (but i've yet to find a camera that doesn't break the bank that doesn't do this) so it's certainly not going to replace my hard drive based non HD camcorder for everything.I'll have to play with the more advanced features later after the battery recharges again, so I can test out the way it will take 6 shots and average them out for a crisp picture.  And some outdoor night shots.  But based just on what I've seen so far compared to the pictures I've been used to taking, I'm not too worried about them.  Even if they aren't as stellar as the photos, just having this kind of noiseless indoor low lighting shots more than satisfied my needs, and made this camera worth every penny.I would definitely buy this camera again.  And if you're like me, on the fence trying to figure out a good thing for indoor use, I can say that this is the best I've ever used so far.Edit a few days later - Movies I take in good light turn out fantastic.  Pictures, movies, everything I've done with this has been outstanding.  VERY happy with this camera.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a real upgrade from DSC-T900", "Author": "B. A Reichle", "ReviewID": "R3EKN6R7WDT700", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have said a million times say that I love my DSC-T500It films amazing HD video, takes great photos, and overall is just a perfect pocket cam. I then got a Kodak Zi8, which also takes great videos (better quality then the T500), decent photos, but the low light video quality suffers from being darker then the T500.So my journey continues to find a better low light pocket cam, since I mostly work from dark comedy clubs and situations. Well Sony later released the T900 a sequel to the T500, and its lower light quality was no better and it got a downgrade from a 5X optical zoom to a 4X. But.. the T900 was slimmer and had a few tiny software upgrades that still made it a great camera.Now just months after the release of the T900, Sony surprisingly pulled the T900 from the shelves and released a new camera called the DSC-TX1. While this camera is stated as the new version of the T500/T900 series on many websites (including Amazon), I dont believe it.It has a smaller LCD (3\" down from 3.5\") a mono mic (instead of the stereo mic of the t500/t900) and familiar 4X optical zoom. So why am I reviewing a camera that seems like a downgrade?Well Sony is using a new lens system called the \"Exmor R\". It's been said that these new optics have TWICE the low light quality as the previous cameras. The touchscreen also got an upgrade even if it's smaller and has more of a iphone'isk menu system. With finger swipes you can view new photos, even draw on photos using your finger or the included stylus. The hardware is slimmer, tiny in fact.. and the photo quality (especially during low light) is way better then the t500/t900.This camera is packed with new features and shooting modes, like my favorite, \"Hand-Held Twilight\" which take 7 photos in a second of a subject with no flash, combines the photos using software and makes the perfect single photo. Its cool how it works, it detects things like walls, and removes the static. It does an amazing job.So why am I returning this camera?Well for most people I would say buy this camera now.. its a great photo camera for it's size, and has some really neat features. But as a owner of the previous model i'm spoiled. The TX1 doesn't have a \"movie mode\" button like the t500/t900, you have to use the menu system to turn it on. The MONO mic sounds fine, but its no where close to being as good as the STEREO mic of the past. The LCD screen is bright, and high quality.. but its smaller.. and the menu system seems cluttered and annoyingly thought out. The zoom is now buttons on top of the camera, so its clumsy to use, compared to the t500's rocker which you slide your finger on to zoom.But here is the main reason... The video, while has amazingly richer colors, and blacker blacks.. is no brighter in low light situations. How is that possible? When comparing the videos of the T500 to the TX1 the T500 actually had better low light! While the video had more static, it was alot better. So it might be a little more washed out on the T500, and have more of a grainy look to it, at least I could see things that the TX1 couldn't even pick up. It's not a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable when shooting.So for whatever reason the video does NOT benefit from the new low light lens system. So now I have a camera with better colors, but mono sound and poorer low light.So for my purposes, I will return and wait. I have a feeling sony is prepping a true sequel to the T500/T900. My guess is they are adding 1080P. So I will wait, and see what happens in the next few months. I just don't see them replacing a camera with one that is missing some key features of the previous. I honestly think this camera is a T700 or T90 replacement. As for the rest of you, I DO recommend this camera.. it great for what it is, just not for me.Hopefully since they pulled the recently released T900 off their website, something better will replace it soon.PROS:-New Exmor R lens system does reduce grain and increase low light photo quality-Great low light features and options for photos (only)-The Auto modes work well (photos)-720p video is great for it's size, and the colors are rich, and blacks are black-Video can record up to 32 min or 2GB at a time, then it stops and you have to hit record again, compared to the T500's 10 min limit. (T900 also had the 32 min limit)-Great Slim Design, better battery door lock then DSC-t500-Panoramic mode is quick and painless with stunning results-10 FPS mode for action shots is great-Touchscreen works well, and looks great-It's fast to take photos-You can zoom during video!CONS:-Mono Microphone-3\" screen instead of the previous 3.5\"-Amazing Low light quality doesn't seem to work in Video mode.-No actual video mode button (touchscreen based)-Zoom buttons seems awkward to use during filming-Battery/memory card is squeezed in camera's tiny body-4X optical zoom instead of 5X of DSC-T500If you search the internet for \"redban and dsc-tx1\"  I have numerous videos and photo samples available from my full review.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera", "Author": "S.

I too have owned several cameras, including 2 DSLRs, so I can comment on the capabilities of the camera in a broader context. This is a technological tour-de-force. Its picture quality during daylight shooting is definitely good. The images are generally well exposed and have noise that I find average for its class (ultracompact). However, this camera rocks at low light shooting. Using the twilight mode, I get amazingly bright and smooth photos for dark environments. I've never seen such a small camera have such detailed low-light photos. The touch-screen interface is slick, but does have a bit of a learning curve. Plus, the camera camera has 720p recording capability. Other unique features such as smile detection and a panoramic mode both work surprisingly well. Last, I cannot help but be amazed at the size and design of this camera. It is truly pocketable. Perfect... no.

Niedzielski", "ReviewID": "R25BZ4Y7O6IMU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally buy my products through Amazon, but I am here in Taiwan when the TX1 was released and I decided to take a stab and buy one from the local 3C.I was wary of getting the touch screen version, having tried my sister's T9 from last year and not liking the interface. But I have to say that the screen on the TX1 is very much improved and now I wonder if I could go back to a conventional interface. Taking pictures with this camera is so much fun.Because it is so thin and light, pressing the shutter release button without adding shake to the shot takes a very steady hand. I rather prefer to use the 2-second timer, which gives me just enough time after pressing the button to steady up the focus frame on my subject. My only caveat so far is that I could keep it on 2-second timer as default, rather having to set it for each shot.This, combined with the various technologies give great low-light shots, really incredible for hand-held. The TX1 is my so-called \"American Express\" camera, replacing my much larger and less-forgiving Fujifilm F31fd. It is really hard to take bad shots with this camera, and if you take the time to learn the benefits of the various modes, I am certain you will get great results too.I was also skeptical of getting the rather narrow range of the 35mm lens, thinking I would prefer the wider lens on the WX1 when it comes out next month, but the panorama mode is awesome so I don't miss having the wider lens. All of the technologies work well, and are not just Sony's hype. This camera really deserves way better than two stars.Give this little gem a spin.

Even though the camera is really simple to use, there are small tweaks that you have to adjust in order to create a perfect picture.I got this camera and its sibling (wx1) for 2 main reasons:1.- portability and ease to use2.- PARTY SHOT. if you have not heard about this you are just missing out. its this little dock that rotates, pan and tilts to automatically shoot pictures... its a great neat addition to a compatible sony camera and I would highly recommend this gadget also.so here's the things I love about the camera:1.- Easy to use2.- Takes great panoramic photos3.- Captures great indoor pictures4.-good battery life5.-touch screen with a lot of great add ons (like basic picture editing features built into the camera) it even comes with a stylus pen.Now the not so great features are:1.- NO DOCK. you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it... there is no way of charging the camera's battery without removing it.2.- proprietary cable: I guess this is the most annoying and irritating feature (or non feature) of the camera: Sony created this  weird looking dongle that is supposed to make life easier... you plug in the camera one end (again, proprietary port, not the standard mini usb port you would find in other cameras) and on the other end you have a standard video and audio jacks that you would plug into your TV  and a USB port for downloading pictures.

When setting on \"P\" mode I found out that switching the White Balance from \"Auto\" or \"Daylight\" to \"Flash\" in improves outdoor photos color, tone, exposure and warmness. I was so amazed in the difference!!  See my photos above![...]After 3 weeks of waiting for this camera to be released I now have it in my hands and taken over 500 pictures. Within those photos I have found out the best settings for the right scenes and conditions. With that, I will clear up problems previous owners have had.First, I'm sure all of you want to know how good the new Exmor R sensor is. It's pretty good, WITH THE RIGHT SETTINGS. I will go into that later.This camera really has some cool features, Like Sweep Panorama, Smile Shutter, Handheld Twilight and AntiMotion Blur Mode.The key is setting the camera up for the right scenes, which means not keeping it set on Intelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode(AKA Auto everything). I find that iSNC mode and easy mode don't work well and as a result people are complaining about the the noise, the low light picture quality and outdoor picture quality.I'm now going to go though the scenes and the right settings and modes to put the camera on for best results.For Low Light shots(at widest zoom):Again iSCN Doesn't work well at all in low light.  You have to switch the camera to Handheld Twilight mode and adjust the Exposure Value(EV) from -0.3 to -1.7(this is a very important setting that needs to be set on order to remove the noisyness and grain from the photo, a setting people don't adjust and then complain about how bad the photo looks in low light). You might also want to try different White Balances,setting correctly results in really nice low light shots.Outdoor shots:This camera in iSCN mode seems to keep the lens all the way open(F2.4)and it adjusts the shutter speed(a big No No)resulting in washed out over exposed photos(yuck).The solution: switch to \"P\" Mode which closes down the lens to around a nice F5.0 to F7.1(much better) and switch the White Balance to \"Flash\" . Also for better exposure you can again adjust the EV.Panorama Shots: This one's tricky, from where you press the shutter to start the panorama it locks the exposure at that point.  If you start in a dark scene and move across through a bright scene, It's going to be over exposed. Make sure you start in a modernity lit scene and if needed switch EV from -0.3 to -1.0.Hopefully this information helps and clears up previous reviewers problems with this camera.Other good things to add: This camera does quite nicely in bright sun light(see my  test photos above, however amazon doesn't let you upload them in high quality but you'll get the idea). Takes really nice close up Marco photos.  High Definition video is really nice and clear(just remember to adjust the EV in low light 1.0 to 2.0 to remove noise).Over all a nice Sony camera great size, style and pictures.Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.I should be adding more to this review soon.[...]", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slightly better at low light but terrible with good light", "Author": "R. Tammany", "ReviewID": "R25ESHL6HS8L12", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As an owner of a smattering of point and shoot cameras and high end DSLR's, I can be more picky than most about cameras.I own an old 6MP Sony T9 slim camera from 4 years or so back and this looked like a promising upgrade for a slim pocketable camera. HD MP4 video, 4x zoom, almost twice the MP, touch screen and this new touted Exmor R sensor.The T9 isn't a great camera, in fact it's one of the worst at image quality of all of my cameras, and it's memory stick duo format is constantly a hassle.Unfortunately this new TX1 still uses Memory Stick Duo, and is somehow just as bad in terms of image quality as the old T9. It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light. Set manually to the lowest ISO (125) and placed on a tripod, the T9 produces shots with more detail and dynamic range while the TX1 has a grainy soft and blown highlight look to everything. This is with the best possible conditions, and in my opinion the shots from this camera are completely unacceptable. That means it only gets worse from there. Handheld shots in the automatic modes have much more noise and grain in them, even in full daylight. Trees in the distance look like water paintings. Neither camera is good with contrasty scenes, but all I want out of a small pocket camera is acceptable images to resize and post on facebook and so on.The TX1 will do, but for the price the quality is terrible. Cut the price in half and I might think about keeping it but this is all about style over design.It does have some neat features like a high speed burst mode, an anti shake mode that takes multiple exposures and combines and aligns in camera, face detection and so on. It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use. Just double tapping on where you want the camera to focus is very nice as well. The zoom slider is probably the worst physical part on this camera, not very sensitive, and then when you finally get it to zoom, it shoots quickly from the wide end to the telephoto end which means you are always overzooming and having to back off, which is frustrating when all you want is to frame the image.If this is going to be your only small camera I would choose something else probably from Canon or Panasonic, it will be a slightly larger camera but the jump in quality will be very noticeable.I'm going to return it and keep the T9 for the pocket slim camera that I don't care about, and use the SD870is and LX-3 as my other smaller cameras. Unless the price on this really drops, or you just have to have this for the style and don't care about camera-phone quality pictures from a dedicated camera I would stay away from this model.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my expectation!", "Author": "H.

But after playing with DMC-LX3 for a few minutes, I knew it wasn't for me, since you have to manually set adjustments to get the best result.Then I saw Sony coming out with two new cameras with EXMOR-R sensor, which is specifically designed for low light, hand-held, high iso picture taking.  It sounded very interesting, but since there are no cameras with this sensor yet, (only camcorders), I decided to give it a try.Once I received the camera, I immediately tried the hand-held twilight mode.  It worked better than I expected!  It can take 6 consecutive pictures at once, and stack them together to get a high detailed picture, without showing the usual grainy high iso result.  I even compared with my DMC-ZS3, and the TX1 is definitely a lot better in low light picture.  No more using tripod, just hand-held and shoot.The other feature that I love is the Panorama mode, it has two settings, Standard or Wide, depend on how much you want to capture.  It's very easy to operate, and there is no more taking multiple pictures, then download to your computer to stitch them together! You can see the result instantly!Other features worth mention is the 10FPS mode, DRO (Dynamic Range Optimizer) mode which shows better shadow and highlights, and the paint mode (add frames, and write text on pictures).  Date Stamp is done with the PMB software.HD video quality is actually better than the DMC-ZS3 AVCHD-lite.  Although the sound is MONO compared to ZS3's Stereo, but the video quality and easy to work with editing software make up the difference!  You can also zoom in/out during video capturing, and it does not record the zooming sound.The only thing that it can not compare to the DMC-ZS3 is the outdoor pictures. It does not have the sharpness, but it's more than enough to display on monitor, and print on photo papers.Overall I am very satisfied, and would recommend this to anyone looking for ultra-compact point&shoot; camera.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just what I was looking for", "Author": "S.

Having faith and loyalty in the Canon brand (this was our 4th Canon Camera purchase, two of which were Canon AE-1s given as gifts) I contacted Canon and was sorely disappointed.  Even though many other models with the same faulty CCD had been recalled they refused to stand behind this product.After a year of research and looking at many cameras, I came across the Sony DSC-TX1.  It got me thinking about all of the Sony products we have had in the past.  Which included at least 2 Sony camcorders, a very early digital camera; Sony Mavica MVC-FD75, various other electronics and most recently a Sony Bravia V-Series KDL-40V3000 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV.  We have been very pleased with every one of those products.  As a matter of fact, the MVC-FD75 took amazing pictures even though the megapixels were only 0.3 and used a 3.5 floppy to store images.  My husband still uses that camera.So, mostly on a whim, I thought to h*** with reviews and purchased the TX-1.  I LOVED it from day one!  It is very intuitive, and easy to use.  I used it as soon as I got the battery charged - and that, the battery, is the only thing I can say is a slight negative. I prefer a camera that uses off the shelf AA batteries, to the inconvenience of having to charge a battery.  However I am more than willing to suffer that inconvenience for a quality, sleek, sexy, fun to use camera.I flipped  through the manual while the battery charged.  As soon as the battery charged, I started using the camera.  I found it amazingly easy to use with just that little bit of reading.  I took panoramas, photos with the foreground in focus and the background unfocused and vice versa, and very clear macros (the canon could do all of these things, but it was a pain, and the macros were almost impossible).  The low light pictures were much better then any other camera I have owned.  The size is another thing I love...it's about the same size as my cell phone.I suspect that a professional photographer may disagree with my assessment.  That being said, if you are a casual user looking for a point and shoot that is easy and fun to use and small in size, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "If only it took good pictures..", "Author": "Steve S.", "ReviewID": "R2OUJN1NJ5RYS8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase a new pocket camera to take on a trip to Disney World. I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens. I purchased two cameras and compared them for several days prior to the trip. The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The Sony is smaller, has better battery life, and does HD video. It has some unique and interesting modes including the rapid 10 shot and slick panoramic modes. The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0), full manual controls, a unique flexible control ring/dial, RAW capability, great build quality/feel and very low noise levels for a pocket camera. Its battery charger requires only two hours. The downsides of the Sony include a slow included battery charger (6 hours but you can buy a faster charger for $50), cheaper build quality/feel, and really poor auto white balance requiring constant manual tweaking. The contrast and exposure levels were also inconsistent and usually worse than the Canon, requiring tweaking in Photoshop. The Sony also had higher noise levels at all ISO values. Lastly, from the \"what were they thinking??\" category, the flash is placed in a position where the lens blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image at the wide end of the lens. This is readily noticeable. The downsides of the Canon are its larger size (but still pocketable), the lack of HD video, worse battery life (buy a second battery) and its narrower zoom range (28-105 mm equivalent vs. the Sony's 25-120 mm). The bottom line was that I was getting a camera mainly for pictures and while I will miss the HD video and some of the Sony's special modes, the picture quality of the Canon was clearly superior to the Sony. Its low light capabilities were also greater with the faster lens, its own lower resolution high sensitivity mode, and lower noise levels. I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon. I took about 700 pictures and shot about 50 videos with the Canon on my trip and feel that I clearly made the right choice. While the Sony was good, the Canon was the clear winner here. Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures, important when handing your camera to someone to shoot your picture. For me, it was all about picture quality.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great size, good-to-great performance", "Author": "Wade Walker", "ReviewID": "R3W13X6TYI8Z5Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The short review:I've owned this camera for a week and tested it out thoroughly. If you want the smallest, most convenient camera possible, this is the one for you. If you want great low-light performance and great high-def video quality, this is the one for you. If you want ultimate still-picture quality, this is not the one for you.The long review:I bought this camera to replace my aging Sony DSC-T7. I loved the thinness and convenience of the T7, but after four years it was getting long in the tooth -- at only 5.1 megapixels, 3x zoom, and 640x480 video, it's almost prehistoric by today's standards.I watched the evolution of Sony's thin cameras after the T7 and T9, but was distressed to see that after they added the touch screens, the cameras bulged out to more than twice as thick as the T7. The whole point of a thin camera is that you can slip it into your pocket and forget it's there. The T900 was almost twice as thick as the thinnest part of the T7, which was a deal-breaker for me.So I was happy to see the TX1 appear earlier this year. It's still thicker than the T7, but when you put them side by side it's a pretty close call, and the TX1's curvaceous body makes it feel a bit thinner than it is. At 10.2 megapixels, 4x zoom, and 1280x720 video, the specs are about twice as good as the T7. But looking at the reviews was a bit discouraging. The highly technical reviewers generally praised it, but many everyday users reported problems.I decided to buy a TX1 anyway, and I'm glad I did.First the cons. Like any camera this size, they had to make sacrifices to get the smallness. The image quality is not going to be as good as a larger camera with a non-folded lens system and a bigger sensor. If you do very careful shots of standard test patterns, you can see that there's a tiny bit of fuzziness near the edges of the picture when you zoom in, and the image has more grain at a given light level than a large camera would have. You can check Imaging Resource's review of the TX1 for details.My main problem with it (as with the T7) is that when you take pictures in very low light with the flash on, your subjects can look white and washed out if you're not careful. You can fix this by using the slow-synchro flash setting and by standing back further from your subject, but it takes some experimentation to learn to use it well. As others have commented, you really do need to read the manual, experiment with the settings, and learn how to get the best results with it.But no one should be buying this camera because they want the best possible picture quality. If that's what you're after, you really should buy a DSLR. They're much bigger, but the image quality is unmatched.The real reason to buy this camera is to take pictures that you wouldn't take otherwise. When I'm going to a friend's house for a party, or going out on the town, I don't want to drag along a DSLR, or even a \"normal\" 2-inch-thick camera. I want a camera that I don't know is there, that I can whip out in 2 seconds to snap off a shot. When I'm on vacation on the beach, I don't want to hang a camera case around my neck, I want something that fits in my pocket with room to spare.With that in mind, this camera has tons of great features.First, the low-light performance is outstanding. Sony touts their new \"Exmor R\" sensor chips highly, but I'm the skeptical type, so I did a head-to-head comparison with my old T7. The result: you can really see the difference. In a room illuminated by only a thin string of Christmas lights, with the flash turned off, the TX1 could produce a good picture in its \"Hand-held Twilight\" mode. The T7 produced a full frame of black in the same situation. The same goes for video: the TX1 can take a usable video in a candlelit room, where the T7 just shows black noise. This low-light ability is great for taking pictures and video in museums, restaurants, concerts, bars, and other dark places where a flash is either not allowed, or doesn't help.The TX1 automatically switches between different modes depending on the lighting and distance to the subject. If you hold it close to a flower, it switches into Macro mode. If you hold it even closer, it switches to Close Focus mode, which is almost like a microscope! In the dark, it switches to Twilight mode. It's like the automatic transmission in a car, where it finds the best gear on its own.My favorite hidden feature is the \"Dual Shot\" option. In difficult lighting conditions, it'll take two pictures in quick succession, but with different exposure settings, so you can choose which one you like best. I've found that it's best to make those decisions looking at the pictures at full size on a computer screen, rather than on the camera screen -- a shot that looks washed out or too bright on the camera screen is often perfect when seen on a larger monitor. I'd guess they're cranking up the brightness of the camera screen a bit to make it more visible in sunlight.The \"Anti Motion Blur\" and \"Hand-held Twilight\" modes each take six pictures in quick succession, then combine them to reduce noise and blurriness. They both work well, though the results are even better if you brace the camera somehow instead of shooting totally freehand. Still, it beats the pants off the T7, where I'd have to make several attempts to shoot a freehand picture in low light before I got one where my hand didn't shake. There's also an option to set a two-second timer, so you can push the shutter button, then hold still afterwards while it snaps the photo.The video quality is great for a camera this small. I used running dogs as a test, and the results were impressive -- there was no digital blockiness near their fast-moving legs, and the image quality was good even when panning the camera around. You can zoom in and out while filming, and I couldn't hear the zoom motor in the video clips. The microphone is mono, not stereo, but it's sensitive and the sound quality is good.The touch screen is very responsive, well-organized, and easy to use. It controls everything but the zoom, shutter, and on/off switch, but it's quick enough where I never found myself wishing for more physical buttons. Like other LCD screens, it can be hard to see in bright sunlight, but it's still usable.All in all, I'm very happy with the TX1. It's perfect for what I bought it for, and if you read the manual and learn how to use it, you'll get great results.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Camera That Stole Me Away From Canon!

Normally I stay away from sony as if it were the plague. Every sony electronic I've ever bought has had complications or broken down on me in 1-2 years (video camera, laptop, desktop, etc.).However, I wanted a true pocket-size camera that was good in low lights, had HD video for quick memory capture, and took overall really good pics. I've had elphs, including the new SD780, since they were first releast. Great little cameras - always top not pictures, very portable, and extremely durable (I'm kind-of clumsy). Unfortunately, the last SD780 did not live to longgg (black sand at the beach). Long story short, outdoor pics were great, the camera size was excellent, and battery life was out of this world. However, indoor shots were almost always really fuzzy, the screen is tiny, and the overall camera was simply boring.So, after some research I decided to give the sony a try...I have to say that I love it. The camera is amazing...the panorama tool and the touch screen are so intuitive and easy. The pictures it takes are AMAZING - low light and normal. I've done tons of pics in bowling allies at night, at parties, at plays, you name it, with and mostly without flash - and pics are amazing! Outdoor pics are eqaully fantastic. The camera is also really small and fits easily into my front pocket with minimal notice, the play mode touch screen options are pretty incredible, and the advance dual shot mode is pretty incredible --- e.g. sometimes for night shots it will automatically do two shots, one with flash and one without or simply alternate settings and do two shots really fast so you can choose which one to keep.Things I really don't like:- proprietary cable- sony memory card (kind-of pricey, albeit a little bit faster than SDHC - definitely not a big hinderance)- Battery life is decent (it's really not bad at all - it will last a day with tons of shooting - but i wish it was better)Things I really like:- size and overall design- picture quality- touch screen- video recording quality- intelligent auto mode - much better than most other cameras auto mode (for when you're in a rush)- low light capabilities are out-of-hand...simply amazing! not kidding...- camera slideshow and editing capabilities- touch screen focus selectionWould I recommend: yes!

When I body-slammed my camera and myself to the paving stones of Salisbury, England, my Sony DSC-T9 performed like nothing had happened until I returned home, four days later.  Then, it completely kicked the bucket, vibrating uncontrollably and unable to focus.  I researched other brands online and in person, but frankly, the color values for Canon, Nikon, Casio,Samsung, and Kodak and the Sony W-series were completely unnatural on the viewing screens. I've been with Sony digital cameras since the first Mavica and I liked what I saw advertised, so took a leap of faith with the TX1.  My daughter got the HX1 and after seeing its colors values and features, it was tempting, but bottom line, too bulky for my needs.I've had the DSC TX-1 camera for 24 hours and having mastered the touch screen am running it through its paces:  *  Low light, wonderful!  That will help in museums and the interior of historic homes where flash and tripod are not welcome, not to mention sparing people (especially babies) temporary flash blindness when taking candids at parties.  *  Panorama?  Not a gimmick to me:  I can shoot the local lighthouse which means I can shoot cramped cathedrals.  *  The pet feature is great. Don't laugh, my first dog was a ham and it didn't matter, but the new one's camera shy.  *  Closeups of the flowers in the garden and some figurines inside without flash came out beautifully.  *  I tested out the film feature, and caught a pair of squirrels chasing on the fence in perfect clarity (not to mention hilarity.)I don't have an SLR and I don't want one. I'm strictly point and shoot.  The memory stick duo is what Sony uses; save to an external hard drive (you're going to need one either for the quantity of VGA photos or the memory required to store all your 10.2 megapixel treasures) and re-use to bring down your expenses if the price differential with other media is such a big factor.  Maybe I should know what \"noise\" is without having to look it up, but I don't.  The outdoor and indoor pictures look just fine, even at full magnification.  I haven't transferred them to the computer, but I don't show my pictures on my computer. Neither do I have a huge HD television, nor a super-duper printer for printing large images on photo paper.  If you're like me, then you probably won't see odd color flecks either (that's what noise is, for the uninitiated.)For me, it's a sweet little camera, a perfect fit.  Did I pay too much?

If its zoom hadn't given out after many active years, I'd still shoot with it.  The TX1 seemed to be the latest and greatest successor in Sony's ultracompact line, and it hasn't disappointed.I thought I'd hate the touchscreen, but it's actually very convenient, and responds smoothly.  About all it can't do is pinch-zoom, and I'm guessing that's more of a patent issue than anything else.  Controls are laid out sensibly, and it's easy to switch from automated settings to finer image control.One of the coolest new features is Panorama mode, which makes ultra-wide photos quickly and easily.  It absolutely works as advertised - it's also fun to mess with, such as when I took a panorama of my friend as he followed the camera, making a crazy hall-of-mirrors effect.The much-touted low-light settings are great, as well, addressing an issue pretty much all compact cameras have.  It can do a shockingly good job finding light and eliminating blur in dark situations, letting you avoid using the tiny, intrusive flash.The 720p video is pretty nice, largely free of the dreaded wobbly effect many still cameras produce.  As a bonus, you can zoom while recording video.There's drawbacks, of course - Sony's continued, stubborn insistence on Memory Stick is irksome, but honestly, I don't move memory cards around much.  The zoom's a bit unresponsive, not allowing very fine adjustment.  You're going to have to wipe off the touchscreen a lot.  Also, I find it easy to hit the power button when the camera's in a crowded pocket.  Shots are going to be grainier than when you shoot with your D300 - such is life.No camera's perfect, but when you hold this thing, you can't help but think of what a miracle it would look like to someone from even ten years ago.

I've had this camera since the beginning of October, and I've taken a number of shots under various conditions, day and night. In some cases the results, day and night, were outstanding. In other cases they were less so. In no case have I had the problems described by those who have given the camera one, two or even three stars.Now I suppose that it could simply be the case that my standards are lower than those writing strongly negative reviews. However, while not a \"pixel peeper\", I do care about the quality of the image. My first camera was a Leica M2 that my grandfather gave to me. What a great camera. I spent a lot of happy days taking pictures with that camera. The prints that I developed were, imho, better than anything I've seen come out of a less than ultra high end DSLR. The Leica M2 was followed by a series of Nikon and Olympus SLR's. I was still shooting film when the digital age rolled around. Until the WX1 my only concession to the digital shift was a FujiPix F30. It's a fun camera, but I wanted something smaller for casual shooting. When I can afford it, I'll get a DSLR to replace the SLR's.All of this is to say that I have some experience with photography, although I would not in any way consider myself a \"serious\" photographer. Measured in terms of that experience, the WX1 is a very good camera for its purposes. I bought it as a pocket camera that could take quality pictures, day or night. So far, that expectation has been satisfied. I also bought it for the HD video which I haven't tried out yet.I've been wondering whether my relative lack of familiarity with recent model digital cameras may explain the difference between my experience with the WX1 and the experience of others. When my grandfather gave me his camera, he emphasized that among the things that I needed to know in order to take good pictures was how the camera worked. I spent a lot of time familiarizing myself with the workings of the Leica. This made a big difference in the quality of the pictures that I took. Accordingly, before using the WX1, I downloaded and read the manuals in their entirety, trying to familiarize myself with the camera's resources (of which there are quite a few and limits (of which there are also quite a few). I still haven't figured out how best to use the WX1, but I learned for, example, that turning the DRO on or off made a substantial difference in IQ, as did learning the idiosyncracies of the white balance and the various settings that were automatically set in the various camera modes. I would say, and this may be a mark against it for many people, that the WX1 is not a \"point and shoot\" camera unless one is familiar with its workings, but when I read the negative comments I wonder if some of the issues complained of could be addressed through a better understanding of the camera. I been following several threads on the WX1 at an online camera forum. The complaints were loud and long about the picture quality of the WX1 daytime shots. Photos were posted that looked really bad. Photos were posted that looked really good. Most were the work of apparently accomplished photographers. Finally someone complained that the camera wouldn't shoot over 800 in the handheld nighttime setting. Someone else said that they had no problem shooting at higher speeds in that setting. It turned out that the the problem was that in one case (the no greater than 800 case), the DRO was on. It also turned out that with the DRO turned off, many of the problems with the IQ of daytime shots were addressed. This doesn't mean that someone with all the knowledge in the world of the camera's capabilities and all the skill in the world at taking photographs might not conclude that they found shots taken with the WX1 were unacceptable. \"De gustibus non est disputandum\". It also may be the case that someone might feel that taking a lot of time to figure out the workings of a camera is a waste of time.

I would buy it again.I would ask SONY to change a few things: 1) The power and shutter buttons are too flush and difficult to feel in the dark. I would give then some texture as they are unusable with gloves. 2) The battery/memory stick panel opens too easily when pulling the camera out of a pocket or tight spot. 3) Most importantly for me, the shutter does not click fast enough. Being an SLR user, I am used to instant reaction speed between the moment I press the button and the moment the shutter clicks. So much movement occurs by the subject in the 1 to 4 seconds (depending on lighting) it takes the shutter to click on this Cybershot.  I wonder if point and shoot cameras like this one could do better. 4) Reviewing photos after a shot ... is too slow. Surely, the last photo can be put into a memory buffer to immediately be shown when the review button is pressed. Instead it takes ... 3 to 5 seconds because you have to wait for the current photo to be processed and then wait wait wait to press the review button and if you press it twice ... oops, your still in picture-taking mode. 5) Come on SONY!!

It also results in the ability to keep shooting snapshots without disrupting the subject with a bright flash. 4) Handheld Twightlight mode is amazing and results in excellent difficult to capture nighttime shots by shooting multiple pictures and having the camera derive a motionless image. 5) Panorama mode is so much fun and results in excellent shots.

Comparing it to the Canon SX200 and Panasonic ZS3, I found that their low-light images were inferior to the WX1 (very noisy).  My macro photos have excellent color and detail.  As other people have stated, the outdoor daylight landscape photos are more washed out than the pictures taken with other cameras I own (Canon S90, Sony HX1, Panasonic ZS3).  They can be made somewhat better with adjustments, but I like to have good saturation without any adjustment.  Basically, I feel that the WX1 is an excellent camera to have when a person wants to carry something very light and small and will be taking mostly low-light and night photos.  Also, it is for someone, like me, who dislikes using flash because of the unnatural and stark appearance that it causes. For this purpose, I would highly recommend the WX1.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sorry Sony!", "Author": "E.

When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible. Instead of there being reduced noise as promised in news and reviews, there seems to be more (see my other reviews for most of the other cameras I've tried), even in bright light. I'm pretty tech savvy and went through ALL of the setting, trying everything possible to get good consistent pictures, but to no avail! We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good. It just is not good for viewing on the big screen, it most likely be OK for 4 by 6 printing but I did not try to print my samples. I have a media computer hooked up to my HDTV and the pictures just look terrible!I mentioned above that the video was good and this is true - and I knew this going in - but why did Sony remove the stereo recording? If the pictures and other features where good, the lack of stereo would have been OK, but WOW what a disappointment all around.This is just my opinion! I wish these camera makers would actually improve with subsequent models - I just don't get it! Sorry Sony.

Depending on the circumstances, you might be able to take an image worth framing, and they are handy for recording still or video information in stores, etc.Lately, I have been carrying a Canon PowerShot SD780IS, which is only slightly thinner than the WX1 but considerably less boxy. Also, I tried a Canon SD940IS. It has an apparent advantage of being 28mm/f2.8 at the wide end as opposed to 33mm/f3.2 for the SD780IS, but I concluded from my own testing that the image quality was worse, especially at ISO400 where the images were more washed out due to noise reduction.On paper, the Sony WX1 looks like it should blow the two Canon's away with a newly designed \"lower-noise\" sensor, fewer megapixels, and 24mm/f2.4 at the wide end. In my own comparison (same scene, same lighting using a tripod), I found this not to be the case. At its lowest ISO setting of 160, the WX1 is considerably noisier than ISO80 on the SD780IS at comparable apertures. At ISO400 the noise levels are roughly equivalent, although the Sony tends to underexpose.When reviewing photos, the screen could use a few higher zoom levels; panoramic shots including text or other fine details cannot be magnified enough for easy legibility.On the plus side, 24mm-120mm is a very useful zoom range, the lens quality is pretty good, and the image stabilization appears superior to Canon's from my handheld comparisons indoors. I did not compare the movie modes, which have similar specifications.[Appended clarification: This camera can be effective in low light situations provided you are able to frame your shots at full wide angle (24mm/f2.4), which will minimize exposure time and, hence, sensor noise. Also, the Handheld Twilight mode (See WX1 features) works effectively.]I should note that, if you are willing to carry a somewhat larger portable, you can get substantially better image quality.

It is amazing. I also love the video quality. I use it for my blog and the picture quality and audio are great. I do wish it had a microphone input but that is probably expecting too much for a small camera. Another great feature is the lens cover that acts as an on/off switch.

Those can pose some problems when they open when they shouldn't (like in your pocket).The large touch screen makes everything easy. This is my first touch screen camera and I won't be going back to the old scroll method. If the camera has trouble focusing you simply touch the screen where you want it to focus and it focuses on that spot.

The battery life is good although I bought an extra battery for extra shooting time when I use the video mode (which seems to deplete the battery a bit quicker).

With that, I am very pleased with my new WX-1 camera.  Start up time is super quick, ensuring that I can go from having the camera in my pocket, to turning it on, and getting the shot.  The high speed mode is one of the best I have seen in a small digicam.  Of course it does not equal my slr, but I am very impressed with the pictures I yield from it.  The new panaramic feature is very fun and I really like using the many scene modes the camera offers.Many people complain about the memory stick.  Back in the day, the memory stick was lightening quick compared to the SD cards.  Now the SD cards have finally caught up to the speed of the MS.  With that, I do not mind paying $20 for a 4GB memory stick pro. Since my other cameras have been Sony cameras, I have already had memory stick cards and readers, so to me, its not a big deal.  If you have had other cameras that used SD, just think of making a $20 investment into a very reliable, fast card for your camera, and use the SD card in your Wii.The only two complaints I have for this camera are it's low light picture taking, and the format it uses when recording video.  The low light picture taking is always a problem with cameras this size.  I can still take decent pictures of a rock concert from high up, or a sporting event from the nose bleed sections.  Birthday party pictures come out good as well.  I do notice that some of the action shots I take in low light situations tend to be on the softer side.

The digicam has a wealth of cutting-edge electronic features: digital panorama stitching in the camera, automatic multi-exposure low light shots, all kinds of shooting modes, blink prevention, smile detection, touching the touch screen to focus on things, nice playback controls such as a calendar display to view images and movies by the date they were taken, etc.  These functions really work as advertised, although the sweep panoramas I've gotten so far haven't been as good quality as what I could have stitched together on my PC.Not so great: The TX1 doesn't have a full manual control over shutter speed and aperture (although you can choose different shooting modes that tend to favor wide apertures or fast or slow shutter speeds, and you can manually set the ISO and EV.) There's no exposure bracketing mode. The lack of auto bracketing is especially surprising because the camera does nice burst-mode high-speed sets, it just has no option to take the shots with different exposures. It can't shoot RAW files, only .jpg and movie files, although I plan to experiment with the DRO mode that might prevent highlights from looking clipped in some cases. The price is somewhat high, but I guess that's what always happens with the hottest new camera model of the year.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "For it's size it's great", "Author": "Robert Urso", "ReviewID": "RM07HKPLC3K0F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picture quality in both the still & video is great and low light is exceptional.

I wont forget the panoramic shoot it's so cool and new :)loved how pictures look in the dark... I sometimes dont even need to use the flash!! yes sometimes you don't need the flash at night! it's perfect for night shootings..I only wish it has a button to switch from picture shooting to video... here you have to do it through the touch screen and it needs 2 clicks to switch..by the way the touch screen works wekk.. I read in some reviews people complaining about it's touch screen.. but it works well with either with stylus or my finger..it's a cool camera and I recommend it to people who needs a small compatable stylish camera that can be slipped in the jeans pocket :) people who needs to shoot HD video with a small camera.. if you need a camera for stunning picture quality go for SLR coz this is not the one.. but for everyday use it's amazing :)this is a link for the video test I took with this camera :) hope it's helpful[...]", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Point & Shoot Digital Camera I Ever Got ;) SONY TX1", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2JDICCG9S6MD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just ordered this camera a couple days ago , so far been testing every feature it has. twilight mode is amazing you don't need to use flash at all to take your pictures due to the great EXMOR R sensor and thats exactly what i have been waiting for in a camera all this time, i hate using flash truly because i feel that it ruins all the detail and the beauty of the picture.

HD MP4 video, 4x zoom, almost twice the MP, touch screen and this new touted Exmor R sensor.The T9 isn't a great camera, in fact it's one of the worst at image quality of all of my cameras, and it's memory stick duo format is constantly a hassle.Unfortunately this new TX1 still uses Memory Stick Duo, and is somehow just as bad in terms of image quality as the old T9. It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light. Set manually to the lowest ISO (125) and placed on a tripod, the T9 produces shots with more detail and dynamic range while the TX1 has a grainy soft and blown highlight look to everything. This is with the best possible conditions, and in my opinion the shots from this camera are completely unacceptable. That means it only gets worse from there. Handheld shots in the automatic modes have much more noise and grain in them, even in full daylight. Trees in the distance look like water paintings. Neither camera is good with contrasty scenes, but all I want out of a small pocket camera is acceptable images to resize and post on facebook and so on.The TX1 will do, but for the price the quality is terrible. Cut the price in half and I might think about keeping it but this is all about style over design.It does have some neat features like a high speed burst mode, an anti shake mode that takes multiple exposures and combines and aligns in camera, face detection and so on. It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use. Just double tapping on where you want the camera to focus is very nice as well. The zoom slider is probably the worst physical part on this camera, not very sensitive, and then when you finally get it to zoom, it shoots quickly from the wide end to the telephoto end which means you are always overzooming and having to back off, which is frustrating when all you want is to frame the image.If this is going to be your only small camera I would choose something else probably from Canon or Panasonic, it will be a slightly larger camera but the jump in quality will be very noticeable.I'm going to return it and keep the T9 for the pocket slim camera that I don't care about, and use the SD870is and LX-3 as my other smaller cameras.

I shot a video in low light and I could barely see anything, but as to frame rate its awesome to shoot videos outside and sport events.

There are some quirks with this camera which I wanted to point out.GOOD- Photo Quality - Others cover this so I wont go into it, but basically the photos are very good.BAD- Sony USB Cable - This is proprietary SONY cable, so you have to carry it around with you if you want to download photos from the directly from the camera without removing the Memory Stick. Its NOT one of those universal mini-USB/USB cables like you can use on Canons. The SONY Cable also has Video/Audio connectors, so its a bulky cable.GOOD- Flash Setting - Unlike most Canon's I have had you can turn OFF the flash and it stays off after turning the camera off/on again. Its great if you want Non-Flash photos and are frequently turning the camera off/on in between shots.BAD- Battery Cover - The battery cover seems very flimsy and bows a bit if you hold the camera by it. This is a common issue for cameras this small - but still, a more solid battery cover material would be better.GOOD- Auto Settings - The iAuto/Easy/P settings seem to work well and provide for lots of options.BAD- Battery Life - Not sure if its the use of the iAuto mode, but the battery life seem shorter than previous Sony DSC cameras - even with the Flash OFF on all shots.GOOD/BAD- Its VERY SMALL, even smaller than the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization (Dark Blue). The size makes it very stealth as others point out, but you almost wish it was a bit bigger/heavier and had less of a \"toy\" feel.GOOD - My previous Canon SD800IS had trouble with outdoor shots and sunlight rays and washing out far away backgrounds on bright days on AUTO mode. The SONY seems to handle these bright outdoor shots slightly better with either the P or EASY Settings.All in all, its a fine camera. I wanted something upgraded from the normal point/shoot and it fits the bill.

I was debating whether to purchase the TX1 or the TX5 but here in Switzerland the TX1 was REMARKABLY cheaper so this made my decision for me. Certain features of this camera have greatly impressed me. For instance, indoor shots and low-lighting shots are amazing for a camera in this category. It is also extremely quick when focusing and taking the picture which was a feature I really looked for. This is by far the fastest and best for indoor shots. In addition, it takes AMAZING close-ups and shows extraordinary amounts of detail and does very well when taking pictures of moving targets. The video quality is exceptional for a camera of this size as well. Initially, I was weary of buying a touch screen camera but I have really enjoyed it so far. I was worried it would be hard to hold the camera without touching the screen and that not having physical buttons would be a hassle, however it has proven to be more fun to use and pretty simple. The only drawback is the outdoor quality under sunny conditions. Being someone that travels a lot, this is upsetting. The pictures are still crystal clear but the color tends to be somewhat dull. I caught myself using color-enhancing features on my computer after uploading the pictures I had taken. I wouldn't consider the outdoor shots to be \"terrible\" as some of the other reviews would have you believe, but I do find them to lack a certain amount of vibrance. This is the perfect camera for someone younger that just likes to take pictures of friends, family, parties, etc but for outside scenery, it's slightly disappointing. You probably wouldn't notice though unless you had used some other higher-end digital camera under similar conditions. However, due to the size, close-ups, video quality, and touch screen, I would recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect pocket shot", "Author": "S. crotteau \"andromita9\"", "ReviewID": "R2XZZP410XP1H4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is small enough to go any where you go and take decent quality photos. I'm always taking photos of my kid and dogs, neither of which is very interested in holding still for any amount of time. This camera has two really neat features that compensate for wiggle worms. The first is a setting that will take a short burst of photos and then layer them on top of each other so what you get is one clean clear picture with very minimal, if any at all, movement. The second feature allows this camera to shoot up to 10f/sec. Thats pretty remarkable in a camera this small considering some SLRs can't even do that. The only downside to these features is that the camera does require a certain amount of processing time but given the size of the camera it really isn't that bad of a wait. It also tells you when some one is blinking, which is kind of an odd useless feature given the fact that I am well aware when someone has blinked during a photo. I've heard the panoramic setting is neat but have yet to use it. The camera is all touch screen and is more of an iPod Touch feel to it. Also you have the option with this camera to get a party dock. Which when I read about on the box thought was stupid, HOWEVER, this dock was recently gifted to me and it is absolutely awesome. What it does is if you're having a get together and you don't want to be the one holding the camera all night long you put it in this dock. The dock and the camera will automatically start searching around the room until it sees a smiling face and snap a picture. So overall given that this camera is a point and shoot and not anything else it is well worth the money.

This appeared to be the high-end replacement for the W300 and one of the first compact cameras using CMOS technology.  My opinion is that the photos look lifeless and dull, similar to mobile-phone photos and MUCH WORSE than photos off the iPhone!  I realize they are much higher resolution than shots from a mobile phone, but the iPhone photos have such great color -- exactly what this camera lacks in a big way. Yes, I carefully read all the other reviews and took great pains to try out all the other settings and options.  Yeah, turning on the FLASH white balance for outdoor photos (which makes no sense by the way) --SOMETIMES-- does make the normally blueish outdoor photos look more pleasingly orangeish if you can remember to make this cryptic change or use P mode for your outdoor photos.  Yes, you are slightly more likely to get a better photo in the dark if you really need to take photos in the dark.  The mode where it takes 6 photos and blends them together to reduce noise is cool to play with a few times, but doing that to reduce low light blur didn't really matter since the photo still looked soft, lifeless, and dull.  My old DSC-W300 simply blows this camera away in almost every way other than the HD video capability which was AWESOME, but only if you have another camera to take all your still photos -- and I didn't feel like spending this much money to only have an HD video camera.  The sweep panorama certainly made it easy to get mediocre panoramas; but with slightly more effort I get better results using the Pano app with the iphone.  So much for the infamous \"Sony Reds\" -- you give that up with this new technology too.  Sadly, it went back.  At this rate, my next compact might be a Canon or Panasonic.  For now I'm sticking with the DSC-W300 which takes *WAY* better still photos.  If you can grab the now-discontinued DSC-W300 -- get one while you can.

That is why for a number of years I had successively Sony DSC-T1, T30, and T100 ultra-compacts. They fitted all my needs at that time and I was happy with their perfromance. But time flies and new cameras with higher resolution and better movie quality started appearing on the market, so I purchased at that time a newest Sony DSC-W300 13.6MP camera which looked pretty good on the paper. Unfortunately it turned out it was equipped with a very weak lens which spoiled all the good qualities of the camera itself, so I returned it back.Later on I got Panasonic TZ5 and recently ZR1. Both are the very good cameras with one exception: their microphones are on the top facing the ceiling and if you shooting a movie clip of someone speaking in a relatively noisy environment those microphones collect all the noise around and make the voice of the person you're taking picture of indistinctive. So I was looking for a small camera with a front microphone which could take good low light movie clips.The new Sony DSC-WX1 seemed perfect for these purposes so I purchased it from Amazon which delivered it very promptly. The camera has the usual for Sony good build quality and generally worked fine. In comparison with Panasonic ZR1 it has remarkably brighter lens which allow to take normally exposed pictures in lower light conditions. The mono-microphone is pretty sensitive and provides a good sound quality. But once I started taking video I immediately uncovered the first and the major problem, which became a deal-breaker - it's lens produces very loud mechanical noise when you're doing zoom in or out.When you apply zoom it sounds like you're starting an aged truck in cold weather. The level of that grinding noise on the footage is almost as the same as the voice of the person speaking in the front of the camera and is very disturbing. Just for the record, I never experienced such a problem neither with my T100 nor with my Sony HDR-SR7 camcorder. The zooming noise from ZR1 can hardly be noticed on the footage as well. Another source of annoying sound turned out to be the autofocus system. It has significantly lower level and it resides mostly in the higher frequencies but unlike zooming this is audible all the time you're shooting movie and the constant presense of that creaking sound makes very unpleasant impression. For me it was a complete deal-breaker so I returned that camera the same day.One more thing I never experienced neither with my old Sony cameras nor with the Panasonic ones: when you are doing zoomming-out and stop in some intermediate position the lens of WX1 does not stop immediately but continues a bit its movement so the recorded picture continues decreasing in its size and then lens, all of a sudden, starts moving in the opposite direction which makes the picture unexpectedly incresing for about a half of the second. That \"kick\"-effect is also recorded onto the footage and makes bad impression.I also took a few indoors pictures with both WX1 and ZR1 and found that the noise produced by WX1 with a new Sony Exmor sensor at ISO-400 is remarkably higher than of the same pictures taken by ZR1. It seems like Exmor sensor from the noise prospective is not better but exactly opposite to what was stated. The Twilight feature is really good but only for none-moving objects, you hardly can use its advantages for taking pictures of your kids or pets.So this is a decent camera for anyone who is interested in taking just still pictures, but if you are looking for a good low-light wide angle camcorder for shooting movie clips with a nice sound - you'd better consider something else.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Camera- 24mm wide angle is amazing", "Author": "Purvag Nanavati", "ReviewID": "RIBDOKSION501", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after doing some research as an amateur photographer.

I was looking for a small point and shoot camera for live music shows that I could sneak into places that wouldn't allow detachable lens cameras, or cameras at all. That is no small task I quickly learned.Many higher priced cameras failed spectacularly at low-light shots with people moving which happens at live shows. However, time and again, the WX1 performs admirably. The low-light and anti-motion blur settings both take 6 quick shots and combine them to make one really, really terrific picture. I confess, I don't quite know the difference between the two modes, and they both churn out terrific low-light photos.The point is, a camera this small probably shouldn't turn out great low light shots. But it does. Though I'd read, while this camera is a star as a point and shoot for low light, its daytime shots, or shots in artifical light, were not good. Well, I have to admit, I've been very happy with the shots this camera takes in bright light. At most, some tinkering has to be done with computer software, but the shots are wonderful for a very, very small camera.I bought this camera among others to compare and this camera quickly beat all of the others for low light, action shooting with loud sound. The mono speakers on this camera are perfect too. This camera easily beat out the Canon Powershot SX230HS, Sony Cybershot DSC-W290, Sony Cybershot DSC-H20 with the amount of usable pictures it took in low light.I bought this camera as a throwaway possibility thinking I'd re-sell it on Amazon or Ebay, assuming I wouldn't like it. However, I bought it hoping that what I'd read about its low-light capabilities were true. It was! I figured, no way could that be true coming from a camera with such a small body. But I was proven very wrong. Now, there is absolutely no way I would sell this camera. I may only use it for one purpose - low light, action shooting, but I may bring it out for other purposes when I don't want to be very mindful of taking great care of a camera. It will be a tremendous backup camera, but for someone who wants a simple point and shoot without having to think too much and just leaving it in auto, it would make a great main camera.I give it 4 stars only because it is not an unbelievable camera.

Second, the screen is not always responsive (which may seem incongruous with my first remark, but that's my experience). Third, when trying to get back to the settings I want in the middle of a photo opp, it can be confusing trying to find the right screen.Fourth (and worst), the image size seems to change without my actually choosing it.

Price was not an objective. Compactness, panorama, internal lens, durability all needed to combine to produce great images. These images needed to impress on a 67\" HD screen. When exposure settings are correct, they impress. Don't be fooled into thinking that 16 meg pixel files will deliver better images from the small sensors used in compact cameras. They will only when the ccd or cmos sensor is physically larger as they are in the big digital SLRs with comparably larger glass. From my experience using compact cameras, 10-12 meg pixels seems to be the practical limit with today's technology.Video looks great. No stereo, but audio is satisfactorily sensitive without artifacts. I've used stereo audio before which is nice, but versatility and image quality must prevail. I tried a 16 meg pixel TX100 cmos and a T110 ccd. Both disappointed. The files are huge without any improvement in image quality. The Sweep Pan WOW! factor is significantly reduced on the newer models due to the inherent distortion and horizon push of the wider angle (25 mm vs 38 mm equivalent) lens featured in these newer models. Distortion and horizon push notwithstanding, the sweeps are softer because fewer pixels are allocated per degree of view. The resulting sweeps from these newer models are unacceptably distorted and soft compared to those from the TX1.Not believing I needed hand held low light capability, I was awed by the quality and ease of low light images snapped with the TX1. I would not be without this feature. Sony's 7 image combining firmware is nothing short of genius as well as the thrilling panoramics shot with the appropriate fixed 38 mm equivalent focal length used only on the TX1.The macro setting produces the best close-ups I've ever shot.Get a pack of screen protector sheets, the transparent kind. Cut the sheets to size. Some sheets allow exactly one cut to produce two perfectly sized protectors for this camera. Usually you will get 3 or 4 dividable sheets in a pack costing about $3. A perfect sized protector will slightly overlap the screen. Separate the film of one of the sheets from the adhesive guard (backing). Place the film with the adhesive contacting the screen. You should start at one end centering and aligning as best as you can overlapping the edges of the screen. Once placed, press from the center and work outward to the edges. Don't worry about the weak adhesive contaminating the screen. It won't. The important thing is to not touch the adhesive. Some manufacturers provide a plastic \"squeegee\" to smooth the film. DO NOT USE THE SQUEEGEE! It will mar or scratch the film and possibly damage the very screen you are trying to protect! Push the bubbles which form between the protector and screen outward toward the edges. You will get most but usually not all the bubbles out. The few remaining will eventually disappear, because if you do this right the protector will give long service before you need to apply another one. Now, you must do something a bit ugly but necessary to complete this job. If you choose not to do this, you will be consuming sheets daily. Use scotch tape to seal the two vertical edges. Those are the edges which are farthest apart. The metal body of the TX1 handles tape well. The horizontal edges require no attention and are left \"open\" to allow any remaining air to escape. The taping will permit you to slide the camera into and out of your pocket or case without peeling back the protector making it useless. Taping can yield months of service from one application if done with care. The film resists marring by your fingers amazingly well. The best thing is that screen touch sensitivity improves with the application of a protector. When you do need to replace a protector, your screen will look new.A word concerning durability in which the TX1 excels: Buyer beware when choosing a motor driven variable focal length external lens camera. While many of these styles of cameras deliver superb images with greater focal length range, by design, the mechanisms will become contaminated with dust and moisture. The rear element of the lens mechanism will get dirty. The motors and gearing will freeze up and/or lose tolerances. Factory service is the only way these can be cleaned and calibrated. When contaminated, images shot in the telephoto range will show blobs most noticeably in sky areas. This condition is backed by factory warrantees, but who wishes to be without a camera for 3-8 weeks while being serviced. Then when you receive the camera back from the factory, the spots are gone, but you discover the focus is not as good as it was before you sent the camera for cleaning.... then back to the factory, etc. You will toss the camera when the warranty expires. Cameras are for pleasure, not this kind of hassle. Designers of future releases must make these user serviceable if the external lens style is to remain viable. Perhaps we may get to see interchangeable lenses on future compact cameras. Parallax firmware can be utilized to overcome servo focus errors.So why is the TX1 not a 5 star camera? Well, I haven't experienced a 5 star camera, but I can tell you the shortcomings which keep this one from its full potential. Despite the genius of Sony with the TX1, Sony also unveils remarkable oversight which seems to progress with newer models. Here are my gripes:1) The TX1 is not a point and shoot camera and frustratingly, has very limited user overrides. The reason it is not a point and shoot is because auto exposure is just wrong. In fact, all the auto settings are wrong. Use auto anything and you will justifiably hate this camera. For correct exposures, use the P setting, meter in the center (not with the spot setting) of the brightest area while slightly depressing the shutter button to hold the averaged metered settings. Experiment until you get desired results. While continuing to hold the desired meter settings with shutter button slightly depressed move (aim) the camera to your subject then shoot. With practice you will get great shots and gain proficiency. You may need to set the EV to -.3=>-.7 for less contrasty scenes. Reducing the exposure settings to a correct level will increase color saturation. The colors on the TX1 are accurate, perhaps too accurate when comparing shots to the way we view scenes through polarized sunglasses etc. The view screen is very unforgiving and will lead you to believe your shots are more contrasty and grainy than they actually are. Using an HD monitor will pleasantly surprise you as to how good the shots are when compared to the view screen. When your shots look good on the view screen, they will be even more pleasing on a correctly calibrated HD monitor.2) The white balance options never seem to look right on the view screen. Daylight looks too cool, but is not when viewed with a calibrated monitor. Cloudy works best at dusk, but will over warm and de-saturate mid to late day cloudy conditions. Incandescent is fair but not great. Exception: use auto with florescent lighting including compact florescents. The two florescent settings are just goofy. The user calibrated setting unfortunately is entirely useless. Never have I experienced even a close balance correction using that setting in this camera, especially using a grey card. Fortunately, P with some of the white balance settings used after experimentation will get you great shots.3) We all know about the infamous over priced Sony duo cards requiring even more slots in card readers. Sony addressed this in newer cameras, but then you have to tolerate the \"upgrades\". Incidentally, the newest duo \"pro\" cards are not compatible with some older readers even if they accommodate Sony cards.... go figure.4) My biggest gripe: Once desirable P settings are made for current exposure requirements, they are retained when the camera is shut off FOR THE P SETTINGS ONLY. Switching to any other mode defaults the settings to the terrible AUTO everything requiring the photographer to reset all those undesirable Sony auto settings. Fortunately, when returning to P you'll find your settings have returned. The auto default feature is a ridiculous inexcusable encumbrance. To my knowledge this has not been resolved on the newer models.In summary, considering what the TX1 can do once the initiation process is completed, it is the best Sony compact camera offered despite being introduced well over two years ago.

The main subject of most of my pictures is my very active toddler, and the Canon's shutter lag time was ridiculous - in some instances it would take a full 2 seconds to take the picture, at which point my kid would no longer be in the room, let alone in the frame.  So I returned it and began searching for a point-and-shoot camera with a quick shutter speed, which was my main priority.The Sony's shutter speed is exactly what I need.  It takes pictures quickly, and the quality of the shots is usually excellent.  The \"burst shot\" feature and the panoramic feature are fun, although admittedly I don't often use them.  The controls are pretty intuitive and easy for an amateur like me to figure out.  I can go days without charging it, while taking hundreds of pictures in the meantime.After using the camera for about three months, I have discovered a few details I'm unhappy with.  It's annoying that it only takes the proprietary (and expensive) Sony memory stick instead of the usual SD card that all my other cameras have used, but that's not too big a deal.  The biggest problem I've had is the USB connection - the plug on the camera end has always seemed a little wobbly and unstable, and over time it stopped connecting at all.  I can send it in for repairs, but I'm not prepared to go 4-6 weeks without a camera, so I just bought a USB card reader.  Problem solved, but it meant shelling out extra money.  I wish it used a different style of connector, because I've never had this problem before.Overall, though, I'm thrilled with this camera.

It seems like something has changed in the recent years.  My older Sony Digital Cameras worked great in all conditions - low light, outside, indoors.  I never had a problem with blurriness or noise in my pictures.  But my camera broke down last summer after years of use on vacations (at beaches and on the run), and I was forced to get a new camera.  At first I looked at the Sony W290.  I looked at the reviews and they were mixed, but I gave it a shot.  Not happy.  All I got were very blurry pictures which was a huge disappointment after never having this problem in the past.  So I moved on to the Sony TX1, which was a GRATE improvement.  I love the design and the style of the camera.  It's a great pocket camera and it seems to have conquered the low light issues, to a point at least.  I love the features of this camera, but I'm still tossed about it, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  I have a couple concern.First, some Pros:- Very stylish camera.- Love the touch screen.  Very easy to use once you get into it.- The indoor shots seem pretty good (I'm still working on this.  It still doesn't seem to be as good as my \"old\" cameras).- Love the neat features, like the screen shows with music, panaromic shots, HD video, face detection.  All of these things make this camera very \"hip\" and up to the times.My concerns:- Small zoom.  For a camera of this price, I feel it needs a much better zoom.  7x would give more flexibility when taking pictures.  It seems like most the Sony models lack on the zoom capability.- Taking HD Video takes up so much space on the memory card.  Be prepared to download to the computer, or a portable computer drive that stores a lot of gigs.  I still struggle with how to edit these HD files and put them together to form a movie and burn to a DVD.  The documents say you can take video in lower version, but I haven't figured that out either.  It seems all my video files are HUGE.  This could be my user error, so I take some responsibility, it just seems like this should be easy to accomplish.Overall it's a great point and shoot camera.  Some people might not like the touch screen, but it's actually quite easy to manipulate. In the end the video capability might be too advanced for me and I had to return it in lieu of basic video functions.

But i tought this camera would be different compare to others.I dont understand other reviewers that they claim about the positive experience they'e had with this camera??!! I tried most of this camera's features, the result was disappointing. When you take photo at 5MP , 7MP, 8MP and 10 MP, you can clearly see the 5MP shot is much clearer than the rest (if you dont believe me, try it yourself side by side). So what is the point of buying 10MP camera when 5 mega pixel shots are better? I tried many of new 10 and 12 MP cameras, to my surprised, All of them took better picture at 5MP than 8 or 10MP. I must say, the reason i were attracted to this camera were, 1) sony quality 2)G-Lens and 3) The sensor and processor. and after using sony products for about 27 years , I was very disappointed at this camera (DSC-WX1). All photos that i took using this camera were very dull and lifeless. I loved all of the features of this camera but the first thing that i care about is quality of photos which this camera has lack of it. Recording HD movie were also disappointing, when you are recording you can actually hear sound of zooming and focusing when you play them back.

And here's why:STILLS:First, I must say the SWEEP PANORAMA technology is very accurate and very effective. But how often do you spin around in circles taking pano shots?  Well, maybe at the nude beach or Yosemite Park. But not a deal maker for me.However, I could NOT get the iAUTO mode to compare to my $110 LUMIX for indoor shots of humans - THE most difficult task of a lens.  The camera did a fine job correcting red eye, but the flash system left odd shadows against people.  Also, the color balance wasn't as natural looking as my Canon SD940 or LUMIX.  For sunset Pacific shots, the SONY didn't capture the clarity and vibrance of the Canon (best) or LUMIX either.HANDHELD TWILIGHT mode is what everyone raves about for \"oh so natural\" shots in low light situations. However, did you ever try looking at \"no flash\" shots vs. well balanced shots of a new Canon set to INDOOR or PORTRAIT mode? Maybe if you're a Pro, this slick twilight SONY mode may lure you in. For me?  I didn't see the need for it.VIDEO:  I must say this is THE ONLY reason to hang onto this $300-400 camera.  In HD mode, the anti-motion technology is amazing and clarity is as good as the pricier Canons, which are much larger.  The other very cool thing was the ability to zoom while filming... with no motor noise.  Stunning results in the bedroom even in low light :)In conclusion, aside from the HD video quality, my SONY comparison photos against the Canon SD940 or SD880 and FS7 LUMIX failed across the board.... indoor, outdoor, beach, sunset etc.And SONY doesn't even have an indoor or party mode like Panasonic.  This annoyed me as iAUTO couldn't get it right all the time, and I'd miss shots of a 2yr old trying to change setting on the touch screen, which kinda sucks as it gets so dirty from oily fingers.I'm waiting for the new Canon SX210 IS - much higher zoom, likely HD as-good as SONY, wide angle lens and larger 3\" screen.  This one, with the exception of a F/3.1 lens (why not 2.8 or better?), seems to answer all my prayers with a price point under $350.SONY....

Overall I am not very impressed. The cameras has some great attributes such as the lens itself, weight and form factor but also comes with baggage: Non-standard cable connector (yup - you are on your own when you leave the house - not sure what Sony was thinking here and forget to stream via an hdmi cable to your hdtv), no integrated battery charging, compression of the pictures is not great (and there is no quality control adjustment), the software menu is limited compared to the original dsc w1 (e.g. no manual mode), the iso is out of your control except in program mode, the display setting is useless (you have to live with super bright lcd screen that eats your battery away if you are interested on image info such as exposure/aperture/iso) and the average image quality is less compared the older dsc w1 (5MP) when taking the compression fragments (looks like a noise picture) into consideration. The camera has the advertised light sensitivity but I am not sure how much Sony can claim it on the cmos imager: The lens has an aperture of 2.4 (more light gets onto the imager) what is better than most comparable cameras out there as well the iso value goes very easily through the roof (noisy pictures). The panorama feature works well and the optical image stabilizer seems to do its trick (if you are not too shaky, you can get a steady shot with a 1/8 exposure time). Overall: If you are interested in a small, light, good looking and compact point-and-forget camera that makes ok pictures, this camera might work for you. For people who look for good image quality, stay away from it until the 1st firmware upgrade comes along and see if Sony fixed some issues such as display and image compression.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "battery cover can break in one year", "Author": "Brian A.

Initially, and for some time afterwards, we were both thrilled with the purchase. The camera is very easy to use and took beautiful pictures. The panoramic pictures were awesome, and the video was very clean (both picture and audio). Then JUST after the one year mark had passed (of course! Manufacturer warranty only good for one year) the camera began failing in multiple ways.I'd power the camera on and immediately a message would pop up indicating that I needed to use a compatible battery, then would power off. It did this with the battery that came with the camera. I did some research and found that I was FAR from the only one experiencing this issue. Many suggested that buying a cheap knock-off battery would fix the issue, and they were absolutely correct. Now the camera powers on and stays on.Unfortunately, my problems were not over. Once I finally got a battery that functioned again, I found that the shutter would no longer open/close properly. Even if I force the shutter open with my fingers, it will just slowly fall back to the closed position.I called Sony and they refused to help (predictably, as it is no longer under warranty). I took it to my local camera shop to see if they could fix it, but all they do is send it in to Sony to have them repair it (for $260!). Just about 13-14 months after purchasing the camera, it sits on my desk as a paper weight while I try to sell it as broken on an auction site.

I am a point-and-shoot camera user with no professional experience in this area.I found myself carrying both cameras at the same time.  Since they are small, one goes in the left front pocket the other in the right.  I ended up using the Sony for still pictures and the Casio for movies.The Sony is very easy to pull out, flip up the lens guard and shoot.  Imagine a quick-draw gunman in the Old West. The still pictures are high quality and fit my unprofessional needs perfectly.The Casio Exilim EX-S12 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD has a \"lens\" that automatically extends when you turn the camera on.  It's takes a little bit longer to fire up, but does take a decent photo.  The movies however are what I find are a better quality and the format is easier for me to use.  Google Picasa will import the movies along with the pictures in one seamless transfer.The Sony requires some switching on the touch screen to get to the movie mode.  It's not terrible but the Casio, by comparison, has a button for still pictures and another for movies so it's very easy to switch modes.Our iPhones get a 10+ rating from us on ease of use.  That screen is easy to maneuver around.  The Sony \"touch screen\" only gets a 3 rating.  It works, but you need to have nimble fingers and if you've used an iPhone/iPod you'll be disappointed in Sony.  I'm sure they'll improve this in the future though.To load the Sony \"still\" pictures into Picasa is an easy process.  But, if you take movies you have to locate the subdirectory on the memory card and access that directly.  It's not hard once you know how to do it, but it is an extra step the Casio doesn't require.If I had to choose between the two, I would go with the Sony.  But, I'm really glad I have both of them because they each have some very positive features.UPDATE 7/20/12: From the beginning, the touch screen had an unusual look as if a screen protector was on it.  I thought I'd eventually figure out how to take it off.  Today I visited a camera shop and they said it is the anti-glare material coming off of the screen.  They suggested I contact Sony (I didn't buy the camera from them).

Tammany", "ReviewID": "R2YPXXNXKNXSY3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As an owner of a smattering of point and shoot cameras and high end DSLR's, I can be more picky than most about cameras.I own an old 6MP Sony T9 slim camera from 4 years or so back and this looked like a promising upgrade for a slim pocketable camera. HD MP4 video, 4x zoom, almost twice the MP, touch screen and this new touted Exmor R sensor.The T9 isn't a great camera, in fact it's one of the worst at image quality of all of my cameras, and it's memory stick duo format is constantly a hassle.Unfortunately this new TX1 still uses Memory Stick Duo, and is somehow just as bad in terms of image quality as the old T9. It's better in low light but still very grainy, however it's worse in good bright light. Set manually to the lowest ISO (125) and placed on a tripod, the T9 produces shots with more detail and dynamic range while the TX1 has a grainy soft and blown highlight look to everything. This is with the best possible conditions, and in my opinion the shots from this camera are completely unacceptable. That means it only gets worse from there. Handheld shots in the automatic modes have much more noise and grain in them, even in full daylight. Trees in the distance look like water paintings. Neither camera is good with contrasty scenes, but all I want out of a small pocket camera is acceptable images to resize and post on facebook and so on.The TX1 will do, but for the price the quality is terrible. Cut the price in half and I might think about keeping it but this is all about style over design.It does have some neat features like a high speed burst mode, an anti shake mode that takes multiple exposures and combines and aligns in camera, face detection and so on. It also has one of the best touchscreen interfaces I've used on a camera, it's not in the way and it's easy and quick to use. Just double tapping on where you want the camera to focus is very nice as well. The zoom slider is probably the worst physical part on this camera, not very sensitive, and then when you finally get it to zoom, it shoots quickly from the wide end to the telephoto end which means you are always overzooming and having to back off, which is frustrating when all you want is to frame the image.If this is going to be your only small camera I would choose something else probably from Canon or Panasonic, it will be a slightly larger camera but the jump in quality will be very noticeable.I'm going to return it and keep the T9 for the pocket slim camera that I don't care about, and use the SD870is and LX-3 as my other smaller cameras. Unless the price on this really drops, or you just have to have this for the style and don't care about camera-phone quality pictures from a dedicated camera I would stay away from this model.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointing image quality a deal breaker", "Author": "Atwater Kent", "ReviewID": "R1KZ41LQ334OSR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my wife's Fujifilm F40 pocket camera, and sad to say the old F40 has a sharper lens and much more accurate colors and generally more pleasing image quality then this Sony WX1 camera! The other disappointment is the low light image quality which is supposed to be much better than average. In short, it is not that good. I expected a lot more from this camera than it delivers in terms of image quality. In short the WX1 disappoints. Sony dropped the ball on this one, unfortunately.What's good:+ Range of focal lengths from true wide angle to slight telephoto.+ Sony's IN-Lens image stabilization works extremely well to reduce blur.+ Portability.+ Lens distortion is amazingly low, even at wide angle.+ Shutter lag (time from pushing the shutter button until photo taken),is very low for a pocket camera.What's not so good:-Noise reduction smears details at ISO 400 and above. (Noticeable even at ISO 160.)-Lens sharpness is very inconsistent and is very dependent upon focal length used.-Build quality is not that great. The battery door is flimsy.-Hard edged rectangular shape of the camera makes it very awkward to hold in the hand.-Panorama mode is cool, but the image stitching does not work well enough in my opinion.-No settings adjustments for color hues, saturation.-No contrast or sharpness adjustment.-The back-light Exmor-R CMOS sensor sounds great, but is just does not deliver what Sony promised in terms of noticeably better image quality in low light. In fact, my old Fujifilm F31fd blows this new WX1 camera away in terms of higher ISO and low light image quality, and the F31fd has amazing color fidelity as well!What's really bad:-- Color accuracy.-- Default color saturation and contrast (much too low)-- Auto white balance, even outdoors is the worst I have seen in a digital camera!-- LCD image quality is surprising bad, with crude contrast and tinged colors.-- Flash does not cover the lower left corner when shooting at the widest angle possible, leaving a dark area.-- \"Easy\" mode is limiting and frustrating.-- \"Twilight\" mode does nothing really. Just a waste of time and memory.Conclusion:Even though the Sony WX1 has some nice things going for it, the image quality is sub par for a camera in this price range and the feature set is more gimmick than useful.

When I first saw this new camera, I thought this could me my next love, but we had a very short honeymoon - about 3 hours - then the ugly separation ensued!I'll be brief and to the point - the video was pretty good, but the pictures were actually horrible. Instead of there being reduced noise as promised in news and reviews, there seems to be more (see my other reviews for most of the other cameras I've tired), even in bright light. I'm pretty tech savvy and went through ALL of the setting, trying everything possible to get good consistent pictures, but to no avail! We set the camera to various ISO settings to try and minimize the noise, but no good. It just is not good for viewing on the big screen, it most likely be OK for 4 by 6 printing but I did not try to print my samples. I have a media computer hooked up to my HDTV and the pictures just look terrible!I mentioned above that the video was good and this is true - and I knew this going in - but why did Sony remove the stereo recording? If the pictures and other features where good, the lack of stereo would have been OK, but WOW what a disappointment all around.This is just my opinion! I wish these camera makers would actually improve with subsequent models - I just don't get it! Sorry Sony. Oh and one more thing, don't tell me to just get a DSLR or it's just a P &S; - I know that already! I just want the cameras to live up to their billing!

First, was to help a friend photograph a wedding.  I had never done this before, and while it was a HUGE learning curve, I learned what this little stick of dynomite camera can and cannot do.  Takes great (not perfect) pictures in low light.  Take a wedding reception w/dancing etc.  It took better photos than any point and shoot I have come across, however it is no match for a full scale camera.  (I was up against a new model Nikkon)  The settings all do what they say, but perhaps it's greatest strength would also be it's weakness if any because while the settings are easy to use, and understand with help hints, those little \"simple\" settings are actually quite complex tools that make all the difference in a photo if you learn the camera and how to use each setting.  Second, I also had a secondary reason for this camera, for a vacation.  I had a wide variety of pictures to take in Northern Minnesota.  From Osprey silhouettes against the setting sun to the endless storm clouds that took infinite shape and color.  It captured the dusk Morning Star with amazing clarity, and a passing semi truck in the pouring rain from 200 feet away (the garage when I couldn't go fishing).  I researched this camera for almost 4 weeks reading specs and customer reviews carefully.  There were tons of Cybershots to choose from but only 1, this particular model suited what my needs were.  It is definitely NOT a pro camera, but it out performs most any point and shoot camera on the market currently.  I had to drive to a store an hour and a half from my home just to find the ONLY one in stock in a store as I ran out of time to mail order it.  It is one of Sony's best kept secrets, and coming from a Canon Powershot diehard, this camera pulled it's weight and then some.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall is good.", "Author": "Chairat  Modnak", "ReviewID": "R2CBDR4A9VRU6H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a very hard time to find a right mode to take pictures with a very bright white light at night.However, overall this camera is good.
