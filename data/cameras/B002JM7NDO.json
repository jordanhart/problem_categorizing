McGrath", "ReviewID": "R1WEIXZ5HZD6EG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son to take to summer camp. The camera looks great but takes horrible pictures. Even for a cheap camera I expected much better than this. The pictures were so fuzzy and grainy that we couldn't tell who was in the photo...and the photos we took were head shots from only about 5 feet away.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "What would you expect from a camera that costs less than $10?", "Author": "William Jackson", "ReviewID": "RD8M4PR7H2M0Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I didn't have high hopes for the camera but was still a little disappointed. As expected, the camera has limited capabilities. The specifics include:1. It has room for about 20 pictures at 640x480 resolution.2. You must use their obviously dated SW to extract the pictures. The SW is not intuitive.3. If the battery dies on the camera then you lose your photos.4. Even with no use, the manual recommends charging the camera at least once a week.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002JM7NDO"}}
