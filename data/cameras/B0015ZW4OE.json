{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice features but average quality pictures", "Author": "DH", "ReviewID": "R28O8TC64KT8XP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Firstly, I love the styling of the EX-Z9, it's a neat, tidy camera that looks and feels cool.  With the right case it's pretty much a go anywhere camera.  I've got large hands and sometimes the controls can be a little fiddly, but I manage okay taking shots.  Some reviews have criticized the LCD screen, but I find it does the job nicely.  Although it is a budget entry level camera, it does have a decent set of functions to allow you to play around with settings, if you get bored with the auto mode.  The access to the battery and SD card is easy and efficient.  You will find some detailed reviews of this camera on some of the more well known digital camera review sites.  The EX-Z9 is generally rated as an average camera.  From my experience with the camera,  8 months, the photo quality is a little hit and miss.  This is the general theme of the reviews I have read also.  The camera often struggles to deal with anything but perfect lighting conditions.  It hasn't been a good performer when taking pictures at night, or in harsh light conditions.  Thankfully, I enjoy snapping away and will take plenty of shots of a subject, in the hope that I may get a good one.  And for snapping away it's a nice little camera, just don't expect great shots every time.  Macro mode is pretty useless by the way, the EX just can't get in very close as it struggles with focus.  The movie capture is good.  Important note, if you want to explore more of the features of  the camera, toss out the hard copy manual that comes in the box and download the manual in pdf form from the casio web site, and I think it may also be on the Amazon page.  The hard copy manual doesn't tell you even the basics.  CONCLUSION - I like my Casio EX-Z9, for it's styling and portability and it's good price.  As a budget camera that takes average shots it is a good little buy.  If you really are concerned about photo quality then you may want to look elsewhere.  p.s. attach the cord to the camera and put it around your hand or wrist when you use it, these cameras are so small and easy to drop, particularly when you give it to your girlfriend or wife to take a picture  (-:", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Mintyfresh319", "ReviewID": "ROXL2KQ2UNH65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually had the older model of this camera but accidentally left it on an airplane, so I came back and ordered another.

The camera itself has a lot of functions, and I am a complete digital camera beginner. A little time learning the functions is helpful. For the most part with my limited knowledge I have gotten some really cool pics. My friend who knows more about them took pics of me and they came out great! Camera comes with software that's easy to use and upload pics. I have not yet used the video capture/Youtube feature, but apparently does up to 10 mins of vid. Pretty cool, well constructed little machine. Screen is pretty big too to view on. Very happy customer.
