I'm very satisfied with the product.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to move from point and shoot cameras to DSLR.  I was a little hesitant to buy a refurbished product but this product is just like new and I wouldn't know it was refurbished if it wasn't labeled so.  I was really glad that the included battery was fully charged so I got to use my new toy right out of the box.  The D3200 has a solid feel in the hand and both lenses auto focus very quickly and quietly.  Although the body is a bit small, after I attach a battery grip, the camera should fit my large hands nicely.Overall, this is fantastic value.  You really get a lot of camera for the price.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "William Martin, Let Bill Do It, In-Home Compu...", "ReviewID": "R2IQ2RXJLBMGIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, my first DSLR, simple to use great Wi-Fi dongle to send pictures to my iPhone.

I wish the remote had a longer ranger. I can only get a couple of feet from the camera which does not permit me ease of taking family shots as I had hoped, but I can live with this small feature flaw.  Maybe Nikon has an upgraded remote.  All in all I love my new Nikon D3200 and accessories. The accessory pack had a lot more in it than I expected.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Deal!", "Author": "Kaley", "ReviewID": "RN5EM1FBS4HT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this purchase!
