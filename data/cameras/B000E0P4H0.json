The craftsmanship of the camera is shotty, at best.  The signal strength is very poor.  The distance between receiver and camera is less then 20ft with battery, and no more then 50ft with ac adapter.  The image quality is that of a cameraphone from the early 2000s.  For $45, you will get the absolute bottom of the line equipment.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.00", "Features": "Format: Color TV output, NTSC (for US)\nResolution: 380 lines\nRange: 1000 feet with line-of-sight\nIllumination: 1.5 Lux @F1.2\nCamera power consumption: 200 mW", "Name": "Wireless SPY Color Camera Nanny Cam with Bracket High Quality", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31CNF8YZ68L.jpg", "ProductID": "B000E0P4H0"}}
