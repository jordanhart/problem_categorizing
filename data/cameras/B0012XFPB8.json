{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Swell little DVR, but can be had for ~$30", "Author": "neithernet", "ReviewID": "R6S15WF7OAAB0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used this for a quick tour of Notre Dame and the south shore of Lake Michigan today.  It worked well enough for my travel archive.  Because it uses FAT formatted cards, the maximum video size is 2GB.  The camera happily closes one file when it reaches that point and starts another if you have room on your card, so it's only a very minor issue.  Battery life is more than adequate.  I filled a 4G card and after a brief rest, made it through another 800MB of video before I stopped filming.  There is still battery left, but without an indicator, you never know when it will stop recording.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and may buy one or two more for traveling.  At $30, I don't mind too much if I break or lose one.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Features\nSelf Protection\n- Anti sexual harassment\n- Anti theft in booth or show stand\n- Anti robbery (i.e.: jewel shop, handicaps, etc.)", "Name": "Shuttle RO-RP1015T Thumb DVR Personal Surveillance Model with Micro SD Card", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bCFPio57L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0012XFPB8"}}
