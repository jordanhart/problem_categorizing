(I had the 2000Z and the 3030Z too.)  I've found that I can sell my older models (about 16 months) after I purchased them, to family and friends for just over 50% of the original purchase price... making the net cost of the new upgrade about ....Although the older models took good pictures, each upgrade was easier to use and took sharper pictures.  (I have about 6 gig of pictures over the last 3 years.)  The model 4040 is again, a giant leap forward in ease of use and picture clarity.  For example: at normal portrait distances 5 to 7 feet, without any zoom... after you download the pic into the computer, you can zoom in and literally count the number of eyelashes on the person.  This is a result of the high number megapixels AND the Olympus quality lens that has been specifically designed for their digital CCDs.When choosing a digital camera there is a trade-off.  On one side you can get cameras with as much as a 20x optical zoom (but it adds considerable size and weight).  On the other side of the trade-off is that you can get something small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, like the 4040 (but only have a 3x optical zoom).  I think the best compromise is to get a small digital camera with the most megapixels, then take the pictures with the 3x optical zoom, download the image to the computer and zoom/crop the picture (on the computer) without concern of loosing detail (because of the high megapixels).  The Olympus 4040 fits this alternative.Although I think it is one of the best digital cameras on the market, there is always room for improvement.  To make this camera better I'd:1.  Include removable NiMH batteries with an in-camera charger adapter.  (My purchased add on NiMH batteries that last for around 70 pics per charge.)2. Although the CCD is rated at 4.1 megapixels, the camera records about 3.8 megapixels....  Why?  Where did the other 0.3 megapixles go?3.  Included is a 16meg smartmedia card.  This is only enough for about 20 pics.  A 128meg card runs about ... and can store more than 160 pics per card.  Add a few bucks to the camera and give us a usable card.4.  Since the user manual is about \u00bd inch thick, you think you have plenty of detailed instructions.  Then you realize only 1/8 inch of the manual is in English (the rest is in five or six other languages).  And, what is in the manual, does not give sufficient detail about many of the various options.  (You have to read/study the instructions on the included CD to get an idea of what many of these functions mean/do.)", "Date": "September 12, 2001"}, {"Title": "Amazing digital camera, I fell in love", "Author": "\"the_iguana\"", "ReviewID": "R2YC33JRK6RTYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the before time, long long ago, I had a Panasonic Coolpix. This horrible [camera] took 640x480 pictures, had no flash, 2 shutter speeds, a light filter, and came with a 2MB compact flash card...after this nightmare, I purchased a then just-released Olympus C2000 zoom -- first generation, no USB, and an 8mb smart media card. After 2 long years of service, thousands of really really cool pictures, and much abuse, I sold the camera to a friend and decided to upgrade. The experience with Olympus was quite pleasant; I knew I wantedone again. After looking at the 3040, I decided to go all-out and get the latest/greatest, and so I have the C4040. 4.1 megapixels of glory. Quicktime video with sound. More pro-photography toys than you can shake a Pentax 35mm at. I LOVE THIS THING. You can take pictures in black & white, sepia, black/white board, you can take panoramas, you can manually adjust the flash to your liking, and you can control the exposure, aperature priority, shutter priority, and even a virtual film speed control (100-400). You can even edit the movies you make on it. (15fps, they look pretty slick) I can't describe in words how the pictures look out of my HP1315 PhotoSmart printer (another of my reviews here) -- it has to be seen to be believed. What you should get:- a set of NiMH AA's- couple 64 mb cards and a 128mb card (you will play with the movie feature...trust me)- tripod so you can play with extended exposureOther cool features:- read/write light for the smart media- keeps everything off for USB download mode- finally has a lens cap strap (lost my old camera's cap about 1 week after I got it)- uses AA's or the new photo batteries- much lighter than older modelsAnyway, go BUY THIS CAMERA!!!", "Date": "November 28, 2001"}, {"Title": "Another Step Forward", "Author": "William W. Smith", "ReviewID": "R30TTGDMDW0HFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit to buying each of the Olympus cameras in this series, starting with the C2000. And just about the time I discover what features I really want, Olympus brings out a new model with just those features. Fortunately, I have a hand-me-down system that puts the previous models into good hands.And the models in this series do get better and better. This latest model has some significant improvements, not the least being a greatly improved menu system.To start, this is nominally a 4.1MP camera, though I believe the effective pixel count is on the order of 3.87. No matter, it's now at the point where you can make truly superb 8x10 prints with todays's best inkjet photo printers or Oly's own dye sub printer, which is probably the best you can do at home. And as if that were not enough, Olympus supplies this camera with an interpolated mode that creates a gaint 7,680,000 pixel file. I haven't had time to try that yet, since I am wary of these interpolated modes.The extra pixels are welcome, as is the very fast F1.8 lens. This is probably the same lens that was introduced on the C3040, one of the few cameras in this series I didn't get. Glad to have waited until there was a bit more on offer than just a fast lens. The extra speed lets you shoot more often at 100 ISO, and also give you more selective focus when you need it. It's a worthy improvement.Perhaps the most welcome improvement is the new menu system, which lets you use configurable top-level short cuts to get to the most used settings. I used to fumble when I wanted to change from one picture size or quality to another. Fumble again when I wanted to tone down the flash power. Now I can put these settings at the top level, where I can find and set them easily. You can also change the function of a new button marked AEL, which comes preset to lock an exposure when you want to expose for something that would ordinarily be overwhelmed by other contrasting elements. Since this function is so useful, I decided not to change its setting, but you could configure it to do something you do more often.For next time? I still want the top LCD to be dimly backlit -- which it isn't. I also want the attached lens cap not to cause the camera to hemorrhage internally -- which it does.  I still want the camera to come with NiMh batteries and charger -- which it doesn't (any more). And I still wish they would supply either no memory card or one of a decent size -- which they don't. A manual that actually explain the advanced functions also wouldn't hurt. What is pixel mapping? Don't ask the manual, I still don't know.All in all, I believe this is the best compact digital camera you can get. It has plenty of pixel power, lots of manual and semi-manual settings, a great new lens and a quick and intuitive menu system. Unless you need an SLR, with its bulk, complexity and weight, this is the camera to get for best quality results.", "Date": "August 16, 2001"}, {"Title": "Best Quality Prints", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R379V2X5NB921K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was the Olympus D340R, a 1.3M pixel \"entry\" level camera I purchased in 1999.  It was (and still is) fantastic, and has me hooked on Olympus since.  I wanted to upgrade because I wanted two things the 4040 offers:1) be able to print super-large prints (like the 16\" x 20\" and the 20\" x 30\" size prints offered by Ofoto)2) be able to print reasonable size enlargements by digitally zooming into a digital photo.Well, I just got my first 16\" x 20\" size photo back from Ofoto and it's gorgeous!  On top of that, you can crop and retouch (using Photoshop) to your desire, so you can get everything just right.I had planned on buying the 3040, but when I saw this camera, I couldn't resist.  I'm not sure if the extra savings can be justified by others, but in my case, it gives me the resolution confidence to do the large size prints that I want.Also, the extra resolution is perfect for cropping to a small portion of the orginal photo for printing, within losing needed resolution for a quality print.Some other neat applications with the camera's features:- bright lens is great for indoor picture without flash.  do this if possible as underexposed images can be resuscitated with Photoshop, but not too much can be done with overexposed photos- use the manual focus to pre-focus before asking a passerby to help you take a photo of you and your spouse.  This way, the inexperienced photo-taker would not out-of-focus photos by framing the picture so that the center of the photo is the infinity that is in between you and your spouse.", "Date": "August 9, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RBAL5KONYBDE5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started with the C-2000, and now years later, have finally upgraded to the C-4040.

I have to say that I agree with most of them ... this is a great camera with wonderful functions.Unfortunately, there's something most people have overlooked about this digicam. The lens is so flawed that I'll go as far as to say the C-4040 delivers worse photos than the old C-3030! Before you doubt me completely, hear me out.Most digital cameras suffer from something called \"barrel distortion\" at the wide-angle setting and \"pin-cushion distortion\" at the telephoto setting. What this means is, if you take a picture of a house and look closely at the sides of the house, the up-and-down lines of the sides of the house will \"bend\" outward at wide-angle and \"bend\" inward at telephoto. On some digicams you can barely see this distortion without a magnifying glass. But with the C-4040, the barrel distortion at the wide-angle setting is so bad it actually makes it look like buildings are being squeezed from above and the sides are bending out!This isn't a problem if you never use the lens at wide-angle, or if you never take a photo of something with lines that go straight up and down, but I take photos of buildings on a regular basis. I upgraded from a C-3000 to a C-4040 a month ago. Although the C-4040 delivers higher resolution photos than the C-3000, the barrel distortion on the C-4040 was so bad that I took it back to the store and went back to using my C-3000.Unless you NEED a 4-megapixel camera for 11x14 prints or larger, don't get this camera. Get a C-3000 or C-3030 and you'll be MUCH happier. Trust me. If you do get a C-4040, use the lens in the middle range. Don't ever go wide or tele because up-and-down lines will bend one way or the other.", "Date": "September 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Mid Price Camera", "Author": "Mad Dog \"maddog6969\"", "ReviewID": "R23LM4JHAL9GWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My work group tested many digital cameras over the last few years.  We looked at resolution, image distortion, color saturation and accuracy and evaluated zoom lenses at the extremes of their zoom range.  In general, the Olympus cameras performed better than the others tested, including Canon, Nikon and Kodak.  Manufacturers can advertise how many megapixels their cameras have, but the real test is to take a resolution test image, then enlarge it to 800% and print it on a high quality printer.  Our results showed that Olympus cameras performed very well \"per pixel\".  Also, the Olympus cameras gave excellent results at the widest angle of zoom, an area where many consumer cameras fall short.  Apparently, the optics used are superior, resulting in lower barrel distortion.The image size of 4mb is more than adequate to produce sharp 8.5 x 11 prints.  With an image this large, one can zoom in and enlarge 1/4 of the image to 4x6\" and still get a very sharp print.  The ability to use AA batteries is a plus.  Excellent value in a mid-priced camera.", "Date": "February 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera for advanced novice", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1E4RDVJ75UN55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an outstanding camera.

I loved it.  I shot only Kodachrome, and took thousands of pictures with it.  In college, I got a Pentax 35mm SLR, with lots of attachments, strobe flash, professional tripod...the works.  The system was great, but it weighed a ton.  As a result, I didn't use it very much. Twenty years later, (about 7 years ago) I bought a Nikon 35mm SLR with a Nikkor 35 - 105 zoom. I think it's called the 8000. It takes great pictures but, again, the weight makes it cumbersome.  As I result, I usually leave it behind when my son and I go on snowboard trips and the like.  Then, about 2 years ago, I bought my first digital camera.  It was an Agfa, pretty basic stuff.  I was amazed at how easy it was to use, and how light it was. And although it cost only about $..., it took great pictures.  After awhile, however, I wanted more features.  I was desiring more control over the exposure process, the focusing, and the flash. I missed the opportunity to take \"creative\" photographs, rather than just snapshots. And I wanted pictures that had high quality, that would hold up at 8 by 10, and maybe 11 by 14.  I bought the Olympus C-4040 based upon the reviews I read at this site.  I have had it for 3 days, and I wanted to share some intitial reactions, both good and bad.  First the bad:1.  There are too many \"instruction\" manuals (about 10 different pieces of literature) that make it very confusing when you are trying to figure out how to turn the darn thing on and get going. I would recommend one comprehensive manual, with a good index.2.  There are inadequate directions on how to upload the photos to the computer.  I am a college graduate who can figure out most things, but I still have not figured out how to upload onto my Windows 98.  I have read the big manual; I have downloaded the Adobe Photoshop driver; and I have downloaded the Camedia Master Guide.  Still no luck.  Every time I try to upload, I get a message stating: \"Improper camera connection,\" listing some possible problems.  I have checked them all, read and re-read the manuals and the CD info...still not able to upload. I guess I am going to have to go to the photo store for help.  3.  It DOES eat batteries.  I'm glad I bought the AC adaptor and the rechargable NiCad batteries.  As others have said, use the AC plug when watching on TV, or trying to upload.  It's worth the extra money.  4.  The 16MB card is a joke.  I'm glad I bought the 128 MB version.  It's worth it.  5.  It's hard to see the monitor image, outdoors, in sunlight.GOOD THINGS  1. The camera is smaller than I thought it would be.  I think it weighs only 11 ounces.  It is very compact.  This means I will be taking it on those snowboard trips, simply putting it in my jacket pocket.  2. I have hooked up the camera to my 29 inch Sony TV, to review the pictures.  They are quite good. I think they are as good as the 35mm Nikon shots, and I suspect they will be better, once I better understand the camera's features. (I am taking most of the shots so far on automatic mode.)  3. Take the camera out of the box, put all the manuals aside, put batteries in, from the bottom, turn it to \"P\" on the mode dial (where the old \"ASA\" knob is on 35mm cameras) and start taking pictures.  Push the \"monitor\" button on the back of the camera (right below the clearly marked \"OK\" button) and you can review your shots.  Push it twice quickly, and you can review the last shot you took.  After you take a few, use the \"arrow\" button on the back of the camera (using the left and right directions, rather than the up and down) to look through your shots. Push the \"OK\" button to start the menu.  When it appears, use the \"arrow button\" to steer over to \"mode\"  at \"3 o'clock\" and use the \"right\" directional button to select \"camera.\"  Then go up or down until you come to the function you want to adust.  When you get to it, go \"right\" again, then select \"ok\" when you land on the function or feature you want. If you want to erase a shot, push the \"flash\" button on the top of the back of the camera, and the menu will show you how to erase.  4.  The 1.8 lens is quite cool.  It is super bright, and makes it easy to see  what you are about to shoot.  And since the manual focus is set by entering into the camera the amount of  \"feet\" or \"meters\" you are from your subject (rather than by simply turning the barrel while looking through the lens, as with an SLR) it's a lot easier, and likely more accurate, to set the menu to \"always autofocus\" before shooting.  The focus has been razor sharp.  (I have taken about 60 shots so far.)  5.  The directions assume that you already know a lot of the technical jargon.  I don't know what \"pixel mapping\" means, and the info provided doesn't let on.  I don't know what CCD stands for, either. But it is neat that there is a CD version that is more complete.  I still haven't read it all, as it is about 110 pages, all in English.I am frustrated that I can't upload my images, but I am sure I will find out what I am doing wrong. I am looking forward to familiarizing myself with the items on the menu, so that I can use the camera in as versatile a way as possible.  It's cool that it has such high quality optics, and is so light and small, and is apparently capable of many, many variables.  I look forward to reviewing again, hopefully in the next two weeks, after I have gotten to know it better.", "Date": "October 14, 2001"}, {"Title": "great photos, much improved over c3040, comparison to Canons", "Author": "Jonathan Payne", "ReviewID": "ROQNTC5U2GZNF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you read my review on the Canon S30 page, you'll think I am aflake.  That's because in that review I explain why I switched fromOlympus c3040 to the Canon S30 (after my olympus got stolen).  Now Iam writing to explain why I took back the Canon and went with thecurrent generation Olympus c4040 despite what I said in that reviewaboutr the c3040.  Here I also compare the Olympus c3040 to theOlympus c4040: they are very different cameras.Here's the executive summary: contrary to what I thought, the c4040 isnot just a 4 megapixel version of the c3040.  It's got much fastercomponents, faster smart media access, faster LCD, focus, startup.And also important, it's got a much better menu interface.  In otherwords, it's current generation components, in the exact same physicalpackage of the previous generation c3040.  So here are some of thedetails:1: The c4040 is much faster than the c3040 in recalling images thatyou've taken.  It's comparable to the Canon S30/40.2: The menus are improved over the c3040, being much easier tonavigate, better designed, and with a useful shortcut capability.  Ilike the shortcut feature even though I thought it was cheesey atfirst.  The menus are displayed on top of the image you're looking at(or the shot you're composing) rather than on top of a blue screenbackground.  The Canon menus are still nicer and better designed, butnot so much better anymore.3: The LCD screen is more useful: it's wysiwyg, in that it adjusts toshow you what the shot will look like, as you adjust the settings.For example, if you adjust the exposure down a notch or two, the imageyou're composing in the LCD also adjusts darker.  This may have beenthe case in the c3040 but I never noticed.  I hated that LCD andrarely used it.  The c4040 LCD seems much faster, tracking your motionin real time, and much more accurate, and reflects the reality of thephoto you are about to take fairly closely.  Still not as quick ornice as the Canon, but close.4: The low light lens of the cXX40 series is amazing.  You cannot takepictures in low light situations with other cameras that come CLOSE towhat you can do with this camera.  I gave up that possibility when Ibought the Canon and now I am glad to have it back.  That is, if youhave a low light situation and you are not within flash range, then noother camera will do.  I have the bad photos from the Canon to proveit :-)5: I had great results with the slow flash mode, capturing a nicesunset, and then briefly flashing the subjects of the photo to have mycake and eat it.  I couldn't believe how nice the picture came out.I bought the Canon S30 because it was much better than the c3030 asfar as performance and features and usability was concerned.  I gaveup low light capabilities reluctantly but felt it was better in everyother way.  But, I ended up returning the Canon S30 when time aftertime I was disappointed with the pictures it took.  The flash's rangeseemed very limited.  Pictures were too dark.  Wouldn't fire the flashwhen it ought to in automatic mode.  The camera had a hard time withphotos I know my c3040 had no trouble with.  Fiddling with the Canonis very easy and almost fun because it's UI is fantastic and veryfast, but in the end it's the pictures that matter the most, and theCanon's were just too disappointing.  I was flabbergasted becauseeveryone raves about that camera.Here's a few more tidbits:1: The Canon UI and menus are still much nicer than Olympus's improveddesign.2: The Olympus lens cap sucks.  It might be a requirement with theirspecial low light lenses.3: If you're tempted to get the Olympus 720 series, which has a bigzoom, just make sure you realize that you are giving up the low lightlens.  If not for that, I would definitely have bought that camera.4: Buy some NiMH batteries and a new generation quick charger.  Youcan get 1700 and 1800 mAh batteries now, and chargers that recharge inan hour.  I just took my camera on the road and brought just ONE setof batteries and my portable, tiny, smart charger.  Worked great!5: Check for bad pixels.  I just got back from vacation and noticed Ihad some bad (stuck on) pixels in my c4040.  That sucks.  I bought it29 days ago so I was able to return it for a new one.  I am going tocheck it RIGHT NOW for bad pixels.  This is why I buy cameras atstores from now on instead of the web.  Returning on the web is toohard.6: It's nice that the c4040 will let you take 3 megapixel pictures.The Canon S40 only supports 4 megapixels and 2 megapixels (and lower).I used 3 megapixels on my trip because I didn't want to run out ofshots with my memory cards.", "Date": "July 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "High Quality Camera with a few issues", "Author": "\"johntrans\"", "ReviewID": "R2YKPMFX0ORR51", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for about 8 months and like it a lot, but it doesn't quite fit my needs.It produces high-quality pictures, has good battery life (I only use the LCD screen for macro shots). But, you need a 128 MB memory card if you plan to take many pictures while away from your laptop or computer for downloads. The USB port is quick and I can download the pictures directly from the camera to my laptop without using much battery power.I had an Olympus D360 3x zoom before (a 1.3 megapixel CCD) and was very happy with the quality of the exposures and pictures it took without much fuss. Taking good pictures with this camera is more difficult, probably because it is much more complex and has much greater resolution. When exposure and focus is right, the camera takes great pictures but it is not as automatic as my old Olympus.I travel a lot internationally and use the camera to document my work and to send pictures home via email. The C-4040 is overkill for this. It is bulkier and the pictures, while much higher resolution, are also much bigger. So, I have used lower resolution and higher compression to have pictures that are fine in reports and, with more compression in Photoshop, are small enough to send via email. So, why carry this larger, high-resolution camera?I read some complaints about the lens cap and turning the camera on with the cap on. The camera lens extension mechanism does not jam, it just won't turn the camera on. I have done this a couple of times, just turn the camera off, take the lens cap off, and turn it on again. Works fine. No lasting effects from forgetfulness, just as you would want and expect. I like the lens cap, it ties to the camera with a sturdy cord so I have never lost it. Keeps the lens clean even in dirty conditions of driving around construction sites.The issues: More complexity, bulkier camera, big files, and a substantial parallex problem in some shots (things look barrelled or not square, especially at the edges of close-up shots). Even though the lens faster, that hasn't helped me take better pictures inside. Exposures need to be set carefully at lower light settings and I am just not used to it.If you are looking for an easy to use,easy to carry, almost automatic camera, look elsewhere. If you are looking for high quality pictures and high resolution and have the experience and time to get good exposures and good focus (I have trouble getting good focus in macro mode), this is an excellent camera.I plan to keep it to use in more demanding photographic situations but will buy a lower resolution and smaller camera for my travels.", "Date": "April 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "Comparison of C4040 with Kodak DC260, my previous camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R21J6V5W7YNF2G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My expectations when investing in a new digital camera were, higher resolution, faster shooting, manual control on aperture/shutter and finally selling the old one before it gets completely obsolete. I reached my expectations. 4040 gives the best price-performance point. But there are some remarks. These are the conclusions of my investigations upon the harsh critisizm that I got from my wife who is absolutely unsatisfied with her photos. (Most of the photo hobbyists know how wives react on such...investments):Kodak DC260 is superior with portrait and photos up to 4-5 meters. I could not obtain same results in portraits taken by my 4040. Colors are reddish and human skin makes this visible. Brown furniture becomes red, and yellows become orange. I could not compensate this with white-balance adjustments of the camera.Flash photography of portraits are disappointing. Skin colors become unnatural and you feel that all flash light directed on the noses. It seems that light is not distributed uniformly. This does not happen with Kodak.There is a dimensional distortion on photos taken within the range of 1-1.5 meters, this becomes obvious on portraits again.This may be due to the focal lenght of the objective or the effect of flash light distribution. Nose or neck or whatever part is nearer to the camera, becomes slightly magnified. Big and bright noses are the common reason for the instant deletion of the frames.Above mentioned color and dimensional distortions do not exist or are not disturbing on outdoor photography.Be aware that you can not put date or text on your photos, which was a useful feature on DC260.And the last bad point to 4040 is the Macro. Although I do not need a closer shot, 20 cm should not be called as Macro, my opinion.Rest is all positive with 4040. Much less power consumption, longer battery life(more than twice of DC260), much more manual control using the menu, lighter and smaller body, video feature and many more.What I noticed is, pixel count above 2 Mbit is unnecessary for the ones like me, if you do not intend to print posters, do not spend your dollars on extra pixels.

I previously owned an inexpensive Agfa digital, which had only three \"focus\" choices (up close, portrait, far away) and which had no control over the exposure.  Before the Agfa, back in 1972, in high school, I bought my first 35mm camera. It was a Yaschica, and it was great.  It was completely manual, with a built-in light meter.  So I quickly learned about aperture settings and shutter speeds, film speeds and so forth. In college, I used a Pentax 35mm, and studied photojournalism.  I became adept in the darkroom, developing black and white prints. I also learned about darkroom manipulation, opening up a whole new world of creativity. After college, I began to travel, and began making color slides, as I didn't have a darkroom anymore, and the slides offered the best bang for the buck.About 10 years ago, I bought a Nikon 35mm, which was fully automatic, with a 35-105 Nikkor zoom, motor drive, etc.  It takes good pictures, but it is very heavy and cumbersome. After awhile, I realized I just wasn't shooting pictures anymore, because the Nikon was too heavy.  It wasn't convenient to take on snowboard trips, or into the Grand Canyon...and I didn't want to lug it around on trips to Europe and Central America.  Besides, I like to shoot MANY shots when I shoot, and film processing can be expensive and an inconvenient way to review bracketed shots, for example.  Hence, my investigation into the Digital camera world.The Agfa was great, for the cheap price.  It was cool to be able to download images onto the pc, and once again manipulate them in the \"darkroom.\" (Manipulating digital images on the computer is much easier,faster, cheaper and more amazing than anything I could ever do in a real \"darkroom.\") After a year, the Agfa was not enough.  I wanted to be able to adjust the focus more selectively; I wanted to choose aperture or shutter priority; I wanted a nice bright viewfinder; I wanted a light, tiny camera body; and I wanted to be able to make enlargements up to 11 by 14.  I got all these things and more with my Olympus C4040 Digital zoom.The features are amazing. It can shoot in color, black and white, sepia and other options.  It is very small and very light (but big enough to be easy to handle).  And the picture quality is nothing short of mind boggling.  This is not hyperbole...it is the truth.I was not initially able to download the camera onto the pc.  After checking all the materials again, however, I found a toll free number to call, within the first 30 days, to get free help from a live person at the other end.  I called  and was able to speak with somebody within one minute, the first time I called. I was talked through, step by step, how to load the drivers onto my Windows 98 system, and I was downloading images within minutes.  I had already taken and saved about 40 images, mostly portraits of my son. I had shot in b&w and sepia.  I enlarged a few of them on the computer to larger than life size.  Although my son is only 12 and has very blond hair, we both laughed as we could easily see the blond hairs in his nose, which were as visible as his nose itself, when his image was enlarged to about 150% of its normal size.  The clarity, sharpness and depth of the images were amazing.  I had a friend in college with a Hasselbladt larger format, and these images were comparable, when enlarged.  My 35mm has never made such razor sharp enlargements, with good depth of field. And these were done in the autofocus mode, under poor lighting conditions.  The ability to weaken or strengthen the flash power, combined with the ability to instantly review the resulting image, allows hitherto unknown (to me) power and control over the final image. I can bracket by adjusting exposure times, aperture settings, and even flash settings. And I can erase the ones I don't want, freeing up more space on the 128MB optional memory card, which I highly recommend.Now that the Olympus customer service folks have walked me through the downloading process, it is easy, and the results are just plain fun.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone who has had experience adjusting exposure features, to take full advantage of what this sophisticated, yet simple, device has to offer.

Aside from those, the rest are just nits.Pros:Very easy to learn how to use.  The menu system is straight forward and easy to change quickly.  Point, shoot, get good photos.  It's almost as if the camera is able to correct for inexperience.With 2000 or XP, very easy to off-load a card. Using it to shuffle 128MB of data back and forth tho, has been problematic (i.e. from a laptop to a desktop -- but then, that's why there are CD burners...).Lightweight, small, and easy to hold onto.  I've had disposables that were more cumbersome than this one.Battery life is great.  I can normally shoot through three cycles of about 150 HQ pictures before the juice is low.  People have complained that rechargeables are not included with cam -- would have been nice, but oh well -- go buy some.Great, big, beautiful, rich, wonderful, photos!Cons:The lens cover.  Both the fact that it can jam the retractable lens, and the fact that it completely detaches.  The last thing I want to worry about when I'm out and about is keeping track of a lens cap...and attaching it to the camera only created a dangling distraction and wind catcher.  An integrated cover would have been nice.Low light, auto-focus, auto-film speed, no flash situations, for me, cause blurry pictures.  As I stated before, I am by *no* means anything but an amateur photographer...so it could just be me.  There are times that I do not want a flash -- I would prefer the ambiance of the natural light.  I find that I have a difficult time with this...the photos almost always come out blurry if the subject moves even slightly.The optical view finder.  Worthless.  tiny, poorly placed, scratches easily...mine is unusable after four monthes.  And, in bright sunlight, the digital view finder is almost unusable.16MB Smart Media card.  Yeah right.  That's about 5 photos at SHQ.  Go buy a 128MB card.While we're on the topic of Smart Media -- I'm afraid that this is going to be a casualty of the portable data wars.

If you're using one of these lenses, you *have* to have an external flash because the adapter is so long that it casts a shadow from the internal flash.

On the plus side this camera will take pictures in near darkness with the flash turned off, the lens and sensor are that fast , the colors will be off of course but they would be off with the flash also.Digital is still a trade off unless you buy a Nikon D100 for many thousands of $.", "Date": "May 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, easily", "Author": "Charles R. Bender \"easytimes\"", "ReviewID": "R14LMBLDJ1Q3E1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife, since she didn't get along with my Olympus C2500L much at all. She would shoot thirty pictures and about ten would be worth printing. With the C4040z she has a success rate of 90% or better.  The f1.8 lens makes the shot requirements so forgiving that it seems difficult to take a bad picture.  I did a test shoot with and without flash, and the outcome was amazing.  The only difference was the relative hue factors.  I showed them to my wife and she couldn't tell the difference.  The menus between the two cameras are very different, but have a family thread, so I figured it out in short order.  We have medium large hands, so this camera fit out hands very well and is comfortable to use, which was a huge consideration, for us.  My only complaint is the lens cap. It's on a lanyard and operates fine, but if the camera is turned on before the cap is removed, it will complain loudly.  We must remember to \"remove the cap first\", which is not a factor on the C2500L, being an SLR.  Buying online will save a bundle of money and if you choose your vendor wisely, you can have the great experience I had.", "Date": "February 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R26Z6MRFIPPB9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great pictures and extremely fast lens compared to my other digital cameras.
