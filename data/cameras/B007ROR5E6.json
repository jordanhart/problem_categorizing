I absolutely love it.  This is the best camera I've ever owned.  Very easy to use and has so many added features.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a camera for every day use.  It's very small and fits into my wristlet allowing me to take it anywhere.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a deal!", "Author": "George E Ocegueda", "ReviewID": "RKV2QJ4B02LFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was about to buy this camera on Walmart's websitefor $199 plus shipping when I remembered to check Amazon's price. I bought this whole package deal for under $130.  It arrived quickly and extremely happy with the quality of the camera. We now take perfect self pictures thanks to the dual view screen. The wi-fi also makes sending pics to other devices and facebook so simple. We are very happy with this Camera!George Ocegueda", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R2IXAH0AJPYML0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package was cheaper than purchasing the camera and the case separately.  Little tripod, cloth, etc were just bonus materials.

Peel \"Jim Peel\"", "ReviewID": "RF0U3AZC3GM1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera and its attendant accoutrements are just great. The value is stunning compared to what you can get for far more.However, in the \"Smart\" mode the thing makes clicking and motor sounds. It does not do this in \"Auto\" mode. The only thing I can come up with is that it is apparently trying to stay focused, etc., as you move it around when you are waiting to take the next picture. The sounds are annoying and it obviously is using battery power when it is making these sounds. Other than that, we are happy with our purchase and the price.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad at all", "Author": "Phi", "ReviewID": "RTBZPW0KGAGRL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the fact that it contains wifi connections allowing the user to post on social media such as facebook and even to send pictures or videos via email. However, the fact that the display is not a touch-screen makes it a big task to use arrows to enter captions or email addresses etc. but having a samsung galaxy phone or tab makes it very easy to use the mobile link app to transfer pictures via wifi from the camera to the phone or tablet in just a matter of seconds.The scenes and modes are amazing except for the night mode which takes forever to capture and reveal the picture taken. One of the modes that really fascinates me is the children mode. It REALLY DOES DRAW CHILDREN'S ATTENTION AND WITH SMILES TOO!The front facing camera display.....AMAZING. I dont have to worry about cutting off my forehead or one side of my face anymore.I am not too familiar with other cameras but I must say I used to enjoy taking pictures with my Iphone and now thats been traded for my DV300F. Its so small and flat that it fits in wallet easily.It may not be suitable for professionals or persons who are used to more advanced cameras but for the average user or beginner its easy to use and fun to work with", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A delightful camera!", "Author": "Ikey G", "ReviewID": "R2LNRRA3UI2WNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am impressed with the ease of use.

I bought this deal and the warranty for it. The camera itself.... does not take the best pictures.... The quality of the pictures almost look like webcam quality except a little better. I am very disappointed. The neat things about this deal was the bundle that came along with the camera. The camera may have some nice little features, like the photo edit and all. But if you are looking for a GOOD camera that can take some GOOD pictures, this camera is MOST DEFINITELY not the one! The little features it has, are just gimmicks to cover up for the crappy photo quality. Buy this if you wish... but it honestly... isn't great. I've had better cameras that cost just as much as this. The mp & mm of the pictures and lens do matter... Not always will the bigger number of mp will be the better... Overall, I am quite disappointed. The only use of this camera for me is to mess with it's gimmicks.
