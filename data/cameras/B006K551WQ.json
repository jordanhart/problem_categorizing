{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Big improvement from HX9V, but compared to Canon PowerShot SX260HS..", "Author": "E. Tam", "ReviewID": "R3N2F3IX29NJ3A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I didn't buy this from Amazon. I was walking around my local electronics store and played with it and bought it. Overall this is a good improvement from the HX9V. Few months ago, I purchased a Canon PowerShot SX260HS for $349.00 (you can get it for $299 now) and it's one of my favorites. How does the SX260 compare to this camera?Resolution:The Sony is an 18MP camera, Canon is 12MP.. besides the bigger JPG size, can't tell the difference both look decent when printing on 11x17..Size/Weight:Both are nearly identical. The Canon weigh 8.5oz, the Sony 8.8ozZoom:Both have 20x optical zoom, but in comparing pictures, it looks like the Canon's optical \"zoom\" is closer. Canon has a combined 81x digital zoom, Sony's 40x. Canon's 81x combined digital zoom sounds nice, but there's so much noise that it may not be worth using. With the Sony, even at 40x the picture is still acceptable.Flash Control:With the Canon, you can adjust the flash power, with this, you can't....major disappointment especially for a camera that cost $399.00Menu/Navigation/Ease of use:This is more of a preference. I used Canon and I used Sony; personally I like the Canon because I think it's more logically orderedFlash position:Both are pop up flash. I know it's going to require people to change their grip but I kind of like the pop up flash.AWB (Auto White Balance)This is one area that I think Sony made a big improvement with this camera. The AWB on the HX9V was terrible and required manual tweaking. The Canon does a very good job with the AWB. I used this Sony for about a week and went through about 500 shots. The AWB has NOT missed it's mark; not even taking photos indoor with florescent lighting that can cause yellow tinting with improper AWB.Speed:One of the reasons why I got rid of the HX9V was because of the slow processing speed. This camera, the image processor performance has improved quite a bit. With the HX9V, it would take up to 6 seconds to save/process images. With this, I think the longest was 3 seconds. The speed is on par with the SX260.Picture Quality:In auto mode, the Sony does an excellent job reproducing accurate colors. The colors are more natural looking, but on occasion (especially in landscape mode) the blue and red looks amplified.Manual Controls:This camera DOES NOT have a \"Shutter Priority\" and DOES NOT have a \"Aperture Priority\" mode! The Sony's manual mode is practically useless. Sony what were you thinking!!!  Canon has the Aperture and Shutter mode, and the Canon's manual mode give you more control although it doesn't compare it with a DSLRISO Speed:This Sony goes up to 12800 AMAZING!!!... the Canon comes no where near this..3D Feature:I don't have a 3D TV so can't comment on it. I did try to take some 3D pictures (supposedly you can now view 3D pictures on the LCD screen; something the HX9V was not able to do) but I don't think it's working correctly, or maybe I just can't tell the difference. The Canon has no such feature.Video Quality:Sony's video quality hands down. This beast is fast capturing full HD. One of the thing I loved about the HX9V was the video quality. It was perfect for those quick moment. This Sony looks just as good if not better.Memory Card:The Sony has built in memory, it's not much but better than nothing. I used a Patriot SDXC and a SanDisk SDXC, performance identical. The SanDisk cost twice as much as the Patriot because it's suppose to be faster. I can't tell the difference, and neither can my cameras. Both camera recommends Class 6 of higher, but if you plan to record video, go for the Class 10. A 64GB card can capture close to 10,000 picture.Battery Life/Charge:With the Canon, I got about 250 shots before the battery indicator started flashing. The Sony was about the same based on mixed use. One thing about the Sony is that it DOES NOT come with a battery charger. But, you can charge it with a micro USB able. Call me old fashion but if you're going to charge $399 for a camera give me a battery charger! The Micro USB charge may not be a bad thing if they didn't put the port on the bottom of the camera. So when you're charging the camera has to lay on it's side. As others have commented, you can buy a decent aftermarket charger for under $5.00.Live Mode:The Canon has a dedicated \"live mode\" that allows you to adjust the color on the LCD screen before snapping a shot; kind of like a \"what you see is what you get\". Sony has this built into their auto mode. Press the down navigation wheel to activate this feature.Scene Modes:With the HX9V, the scene modes were terrible; the difference were so subtle. This Sony is a HUGE improvement. With the Sony, you can see there IS a difference now. I am especially impressed with the \"food\" scene. With this mode, when you take a picture of food, it's suppose to enhance the color to make it more appealing. With the HX9V, it's a gimmick, but with this it's a 180 degree improvement. My best description of this is when you see those professional pictures of food at restaurants, this Sony can produce that type of quality.  Canon does a good job with most of the scenes, but I prefer the Sony now. The Auto and Super Auto mode works great. For the regular outdoor or well lit environment the Super Auto won't be much difference. For those complicated lighting situation, the Super Auto does a better job. But the Super Auto mode will take about three seconds to process the image. With the scene mode, just because its designated as a \"food\" mode does not mean you just use it to take pictures of food. I used the \"food\" mode to take other beautiful indoor pictures that are not food (without flash) at fancy steak houses, and they came out beautiful. The difference with this mode (and the ISO mode) is that the food mode enhances the colors a notch making them appear more vibrant.Defcocus Mode:One of the feature I like is the defocus feature. This is one feature that distinguish this camera from other Point and Shoot. With the more expensive DSLR camera, you can take a picture where the portrait is in sharp focus but the back landscape is blurred. Sony does a decent job with this (in fact, I haven't seen this feature on any other brand camera). This feature does not work with the flash because what the camera does is take two shots and combine them to create this effect. But do note that when you use this mode, the LCD screen will tell you how far the subject should be and if you ignore it and take a picture, the Defocus will not work (you still get a decent picture though)LCD Screen:Both units have a 3-inch LCD screen, but I think the Sony camera has a sharper, clearer display.GPS:Both units have GPS, I haven't used it on either units though.Camera Body:The Canon has a more solid feel to it. The HX9V had an \"expensive\" look and feel. With this Sony, it's just all black and nothing to distinguish this camera for others. The Canon has that expensive camera look and feel, but this Sony does not. It looks plain and boring.Cost:The Sony cost $399, Canon cost $299.00, $100 difference.. Is this camera worth $100 more than the Canon SX260HS? You decide...Sony, if you want me to rate this 5-Star, please do the following:1. Put the Shutter and Aperture mode back in this camera2. Give me flash exposure control3. Give me a battery charger4. And, give it to me for no more than $349", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Travel Zoom", "Author": "Geoffrey A. Erickson", "ReviewID": "R212PPHNMKMYQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay, this is going to be a multiple day review over a period of time.Day 1 - First impressions. I am upgrading from a much loved Panasonic TZ3.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this 10X travel zoom since the day I bought it and the travel zoom style definitely fit my needs. I was less interested in upgrade for the zoom than I was the low light. I had always been disappointed with the Panasonic low light which seemed to fall to pieces above ISO 800 and not look that great at 400.Enter the HX20V. Like some of you, I had read and read and read reviews and everything seemed to indicate that this Sony camera had the answer to my low light issues. When I read all the other amazing aspects of this camera, I decided to try it out.  The reviews were right. This thing takes amazing low light photos. With IA+ I have seen photos at ISO's I wouldn't have dared come out looking quite nice on my 52 inch screen. I have taken many shots in total darkness in IA+ mode and had the multi-shot process make it look almost like a normal daytime photo. Yes, if you zoom a lot you can see both softness and noise when you pixel peep, but bottom line, I don't believe there is a point and shoot this small that does better.Other first impressions. It's not as pretty as the Panasonic line.  I don't know, something about the Pana black and steel look that I just love. This Sony is pure black and a little ugly in its indistinctness.  It looks all muscle and business, but I am starting to get used to it. And it's what's on the inside I bought it for anyway. The look of the Pana was just a bonus.I will say that the build quality does not feel as solid as my old TZ3 or even the new ZS19/20/TZ30. Still it seems to be of high enough quality it will last. Just a little less solid  and more plastic feeling than the Panasonic.The pop up flash is as annoying as people have described. In fact, I thought I would have to take it back since I REALLY like the stability keeping my finger their gives me. Still, the photo quality in low light, the video, and the zoom have convinced me to recondition myself on how to hold my camera. It's totally worth it.The menu system took some getting used to, especially after the Panasonic menu I was used to. Now I am starting to love it. Things seem pretty organized and easy to see on the LCD (which is vibrant).  I have to say, some of the Panasonic quick menus were more intuitive and easy to get to than the Sony, but I can definitely see getting used to the Sony menu system and some things are placed better on the Sony.I like most the buttons on the Sony compared to the Panasonic approach. Particularly, I like the movie button on the Sony. The dial on the HX20V is bigger and less stiff than the ZS19 out of the box. The onboard help is actually, pretty helpful!In addition to being a little uglier, it's a tad heavier and larger than my old TZ3, which was a bitter pill seeing Panasonic reduce size on the ZS20. I would have liked a smaller camera, though truthfully the TZ was never a problem and this one is only a fraction bigger and heavier. It fits in the same camera case I am used to, so it really makes no difference to me.I will post more as I use this wonderful device and try to get some sample photos to you as I get used to it. I have to say, I am glad I got it so far and think I will enjoy it for many years. 4 Stars only for the popup flash positioning and the bulkier, more plastic build. Everything else is fantastic!Finally, Amazon and JR Music World got it to me in record time, well packed, in good working order, without any hitches. Thank you both for excellent service.Update 05/05/2012I have been putting this camera through its paces for a couple of weeks now and can say I absolutely love it. I am actually finding this is the first time I can treat a travel zoom as a true point and shoot.  I am coming to trust the IA+ mode pretty thoroughly.  Even on other more manual settings I let it auto select the ISO. Something I didn't dare do with my TZ3.  Part of the reason is that the higher ISO settings do SO well on this camera, the other part is the Sony firmware does a really good job at selecting the best settings for a given situation.  I have also used digital zoom for the first time on a camera...and while I still think it may be better to limit yourself to just optical zoom, for now I am enjoying trying it out and getting some decent photos.  As far as my cons, I am still getting used to the pop up flash and yes I still block it accidentally, but then I need the flash so rarely it doesn't matter. The other annoyance is the movie button because I keep hitting the shutter button to start it and it reminds you that you need the other button.  I know they had to do it in order to allow the photo capture during movie record (what a handy feature at sporting events btw.) But they could have made the shutter button the primary for starting and added a button for capture. Both of these are minor annoyances given the camera's performance. One last thought before I go. I saw a lot of Dad's with the full DSLRs at the track meet today and while I can say I did have some justified envy, I enjoyed gloating about how much performance I was getting out of such a small and convenient package without switching lenses. I had a heck of a lot more camera packed in a much smaller space that could be easily tucked away. And with the 10 FPS continuous capture, I felt almost like I had a DSLR (well not quite, but close).  Oh, if I could have a wish Sony?  Don't limit me to 10 photos.  Do it like Panasonic did and make it 10fps for the first 10 and then slower after that if you have to.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Another Gem by Sony!", "Author": "P. Baek", "ReviewID": "RTRCDOZ26E0JE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a terrific, feature-laden compact camera. I have a Sony HX9V also and this is a nice, although small upgrade. The still photo quality isn't that much improved from the previous HX9V even though the pixel count is now at 18.2MP(as a matter of fact, most of the time, you can hardly see any difference at all, esp. when you print the photos). The video portion (now w/AVCHD 2.0) now has 1080p at 60fps which is very nice and looks amazing on a big HDTV (24p recording is also available). One of the biggest improvements seems to be the increase in zoom range--now at 20X. You can also view 3D images on the lcd screen now (without 3D glasses) which is cool. Build quality seems to have gone down a little bit....when compared to the HX9V....it's lighter and there's no chrome or metal trim...making it look \"cheaper\" and less elegant. However, overall, I'd say this is probably one of the best compact cameras in the market right now. If you already have a HX9V, it might not be worth the money to upgrade (esp. if your priority is still photo capability). However, if you need longer zoom and better video, it should definately be worth checking it out.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Moon Craters! This camera captured it!

Nye", "ReviewID": "R3I0UN3TD7X2SP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V is my first experience with a Sony digital camera.  For years I have had interest in owning a Sony digital camera but was turned off by their usage of proprietary memory sticks.  This camera, though, can be used with several standard types of flash media including SD, SDHC, SDXC, micro SD, and micro SDHC in addition to Sony's memory stick media.  All will work for still images and video except only Mark 2 Sony memory sticks or other media rated Class 4 or higher should be used for video.  You have many choices, and no flash media comes with the camera, so plan on purchasing some form of memory media along with your camera.  For testing purposes, I used a SanDisk class 10 SDHC memory card for this review.The camera arrives securely and well-packaged with a carrying strap, Lithium ion rechargeable battery, USB connecting cable, and an AC adapter for usage with the USB cable.  A detailed printed manual is provided, although an electronic manual is also installed in the camera's memory that can be viewed on its LCD screen.The camera itself feels solid.  Another reviewer commented about it feeling cheaply made, but that was not my impression at all.  To me it feels sturdy yet very compact.  I like its black color.  When it is turned on the lens telescopes outward, and when turned off the lens fully retracts into the camera and is protected by a built-in lens cover.  The LCD display screen on the back is huge and provides very vivid previews of photos or video.  Controls are well-placed and easy to operate.  Much of the camera function is quite intuitive.  The battery and memory card are easy to access, and the bottom of the camera is threaded for installation onto a standard monopod or tripod.The camera has a preloaded software program, \"Play Memories Home\", that can be downloaded and installed onto your computer from the camera.  You cannot download this software from the internet, so you must connect your camera to your computer to install it.  The manual tells you that you need to install Play Memories Home on your computer to import AVCHD movies to your computer (this is the default format for movies shot with this camera).  I found this not to be true, however.  You can import movies to your computer with freeware such as Google's Picasa (which cannot play the movie) and you can play the movie or convert it to another format with the standard Windows Media Player.  Play Memories Home is not compatible with a Mac computer, but it is not needed for Mac.  Even after downloading and installing the additional features for Play Memories Home I found it to be very basic software at best and not useful at all for photo or video editing.  Picasa is a far better choice for importing, organizing, and optimizing your photos, and Windows Live Movie Maker (also free) is an easy way to view, convert, and optimize your videos.  Of course none of these would compare with other software that you might purchase, but they can handle basic functions quite well.As for photo-taking, the Sony Cyber-shot is capable of taking some very nice photos with good color balance even in low light situations.  Its 18.2 megapixel resolution allows you to take photos that would be more than suitable for printing.  The camera can also shoot video in high-definition.  The cost for this high resolution, though, is very slow processing speed between photos.  Even using a class 10 SDHC memory card it took a few seconds after taking a photo before I could preview it on the LCD screen.  Compared with my Canon Powershot camera this seems like an eternity.  The photos and video I took, though, looked very good even in low light.  The 20x optical zoom is quite amazing, and I was impressed with the image stabilization despite using the zoom at higher levels.  There are numerous settings available to shooting photos with different effects including a watercolor effect, illustration effect, partial color, and panorama along with adjustments to ISO, color saturation, contrast, sharpness.  Since I have Adobe Photoshop I have little need for and did not test those functions, but they are available for those who want to use them.Shooting video is extremely easy.  You aim and push a button.  Video starts automatically and can be stopped or restarted with the push of the same button.  You can also take still photos while shooting video.  The video resolution is very good for such a small camera, and the video is not at all choppy.  As mentioned previously, it records in high-definition.  Sound is recorded, too, although sound from usage of the telescoping lens control will also be recorded and is very audible.  There is no way to attach a separate microphone to defeat this problem.  This camera is not going to replace a digital camcorder by any means in terms of quality or capability, but it does make recording video quick and easy.An unusual feature with this camera is a built-in GPS function.  The manual says very little about it, but it alludes to recording information about the route taken while carrying the camera.  I really don't know why anyone would want or use this feature.  According to the manual the GPS function consumes battery life but there is a way to turn it off in the camera settings to prevent this.  I leave it turned off in mine.My main complaint with this camera is the built-in flash.  It is located on the top left of the camera and pops up out of the camera when a flash is needed.  As such it completely eliminates the ability to hold the camera with a finger on the top left like one would normally hold a camera this small.  Therefore it is awkward to hold the camera steadily while taking pictures.  I would love to grab the Sony engineer who came up with this design and ask \"what were you thinking?\"  This is the primary reason I docked the rating a star.  With better flash design this camera would have been a 5-star camera.In summary, the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V digital camera is a feature-packed pocket camera with all the bells and whistles that most would ever want or need for a competitive price.  The more I use it the more I like it, even though I do have to alter how I hold the camera to contend with the pop-up flash.  With better flash design it would be a very tough camera to beat, but those willing to modify how they hold the camera will be rewarded with very good photos and video.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Plusses and minuses", "Author": "The Engineer Critic", "ReviewID": "R3RA39DZPIAJ3Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small high-zoom camera that can double as an HD camcorder.  My impressions so far are as follows:Pro's*  The 20X zoom is good (but note that the minimum focal distance to your subject is about 6 feet when zoomed in all the way).*  The image stabilizer in this camera does a good job of compensating for motion.*  USB charging is convenient; I don't like carrying around a power adapter brick.*  Battery life has been good so far.*  I found the flash to be plenty bright for indoor shots, much brighter for example than the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19 Digital Camera, BlackCon's*  The small F3.2 aperture usually requires a flash when used indoors.  Low-light images otherwise turn out very grainy and have yellow or green splotches.*  Indoor video recording also requires very bright lighting conditions or the video is also grainy/splotchy.  The lighting that the camera requires for video is much higher than that required for still photos, and is about double that of the usual camcorder (plus the camera has no light as you might find on a camcorder).*  I don't like the physical location of the flash; it pops up right where I tend to hold the camera.*  I don't like the position of the micro-USB connector on the bottom of the camera which requires that I sit the camera on its lens or on its back while charging, and also makes it impossible to use external power when attached to a tripod.  Also note that the micro-USB connector does not plug in all the way.*  Severe ghosting occurred on night shots of bright objects.  For example, I counted about a dozen ghost images when I took a picture of a post lamp (see attached image).In summary, the camera can double as a camcorder in daylight conditions, but a camcorder (or camera with a wider aperture) would be better for indoor or night photography.  Unfortunately most camcorders don't have decent still photo resolution (check the gross pixel count, not the number of extrapolated artificial pixels printed on the side of the camcorder), hence I'm still looking for the perfect camera that can do both.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast and easy to use; reliable, superb quality images and video", "Author": "M. Klein \"mike_in_ca\"", "ReviewID": "R1VOXZ55H4MPCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was not purchased through Amazon (see below), and it was for my wife, not me, but we've been evaluating it closely together for the last two months.This camera is fabulous for a small unit that is very quick and easy to use, and produces phenomenally good images, both still and video, without spending hours or days researching and learning the modes.  This review is from the viewpoint of someone who wants and knows high quality images but does not have the time or desire to bury themselves in the minutia of how, why, which button or mode or the myriad of other tradeoffs the more technically oriented users might want.  The HX20V powers on quickly, frames the image quickly, and gets the shot in very high quality with no fuss.My wife had been using a 2005-era Olympus that was no longer working reliably but that she had grown to know and rely on, being able to take photos basically by touch and having most of them turn out well.  I did the research and narrowed it down to 4.  She reviewed them and I went out to the local Best Buy and bought two: this one, and the Canon SX260HS.  She spent an hour with each one doing basic configuration, taking a variety of stills and videos under varying conditions, uploading and editing the photos and videos, and evaluating the results.  It didn't take long for her to tell me to take the Canon back.Since then she has logged about 1,000 photos and a few hours of video and even I have to say (as a long-time Minolta and now Sony DSLR user), the image quality is astounding for such a small camera.  It is serious competition for even recent DSLRs in many respects, and well beyond them in others (such as video, and of course size and weight).  I would say that over 80% of all photos are well exposed and focused and framed, maybe more.  There are almost no throwaway images at all, which has never been the case for a point-and-shoot camera.The reasons for choosing the Sony:* Image quality, video quality.  They are superb.  She has tried a number of the modes and ends up staying with the \"Intelligent Auto\" mode which has produced outstanding photos under a wide range of conditions.  The Canon was more often fooled and made poor exposures on the same (contrasty) scenes in a default mode.  To avoid that, it required more mode selection or adjustment.  Either way, it means more shots are missed.* Simple menu system, very easy to get to the basic settings.  Here is where the Canon really fell down.  These cameras have so many features that it takes a very well-designed menu system and user interface to not get in the way.  The Canon system is non-intuitive and definitely got in the way.  Sony's, while equally complex and deep, made the important controls easily accessible and intuitively named.* Fast!  Everything is fast.  Power on is fast (under a second), autofocus is fast and accurate, shutter lag is short.  Something happens and in under a second from cold start you have taken the picture, and if already on it is a small fraction of a second.  Intuitively it is close to immediate.* Videos uploaded easily to iMovie and could be immediately edited in full HD resolution.  iPhoto (latest release) now supports the AVCHD format as well so importing can be done to either one.These high points have little to do with the usual detailed technical review.  The advantage of the HX20V is how fast and easy it is to use, combined with the very high quality of images and video.  This was the bottom line.  A scene unfolds: will you get the shot?  With the Sony, there's a much higher likelihood.  There's no digging around in the menu system at all.  The camera stays in Intelligent Auto mode 90+% of the time and that's not just a simplifying tradeoff -- this mode really does consistently produce outstanding quality images.One con we've found so far is that it is pretty easy to block the flash from rising while holding the camera with your left hand.  Another is that we haven't yet quite figured out when the USB cable does or does not charge the battery so a couple of times we thought it was charging but wasn't.  It appears to need more amperage over USB than some standard chargers (for other products) provide.  It would be nice to have a separate charger, but OTOH it's one fewer thing to carry around and reduces weight.Another thing that's kind of halfway between pro and con is that the Intelligent Auto mode will sometimes decide to take 4-6 quick images in succession to make an HDR, and that is sometimes surprising to hear all those clicks not knowing what is going on.  But wow, the results.... and I'm quite a skeptic that HDR can be done well without dedicated software, but this unit is proving otherwise.Most of the flashy features are just not very useful.  She doesn't use any creative modes, and few other major modes.  Face recognition appears to be useful, but smile trigger is not.This camera is just superb for taking outstanding quality photos and video, with standard settings out of the box, very short lags, and high photo yield.  It is great for a person who wants very high quality results with little effort.  For someone whose requirements are substantially different, this review is likely to be less relevant.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Improved over HX9V but has new flaws", "Author": "RIK", "ReviewID": "RCDWV7797GMMH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Compared to its predecessor - HX9V, this camera improves the following1. Takes better pictures consistently (there was no washing out of pictures I observed in the previous generation)2. Flash still pops up but there is a slight sloping area where you can train yourself to rest your fingers3. Buttons are improved (one can easily tell buttons apart in the dark and they are not too flush with the body)4. Zoom is improved (20x as opposed to 16x) as is MP (18 insted of 16)5. Has macro focusbut some old problems still persist1. Panorama mode is still not as easy as with older Casio models like EX-ZR100. Sony gives you a fixed buffer that you have to fill in, instead of making a full panoramic picture based on when you stop, so if you don't fill in the full buffer you get black bars.2. External charger is extra and charging requires resting the camera on the lens or the LCD side - a bit awkward3. Compared to competitors (ex. Panasonic DMC ZS20) its thicker and bulkierand some new bugs have been introduced1.

Not sure if that is a general problem or just happened with this piece.Overall the camera is nice and has fancy features like 20x optical zoom, HD video, GPS, 3D pics in a pocket size body with an InCamera guide but given its high price I'd not expect any of the above mentioned basic problems.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "Nom de Plume", "ReviewID": "R3U8O45LONH23I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Another update:I was at the Sony Style store yesterday and played with the just announced new Sony RX100 point and shoot, MSRP $649.

What this means is that it can take very sharp pictures in low light conditions.  2) And comes with a F1.8 lens, don't think there is another point and shoot with such a bright lens. Again, great for low light situation.  3) From what I can see, it has most of the automatic features found in the HX-20/30 (the one I bought a month ago)I still recommend the HX-20V for being very feature laden and taking very very good pictures. Especially the 20x zoom as compared to the new RX100 with 3.6x zoom. The RX100's zoom is a compromise Sony had to make considering the huge 1\" sensor that will require longer and bigger diameter lens asembly to get the high zoom.And here's the \"but\", if you are thinking about buying a DSLR,buy the RX100. The zoom is roughly equivalent to the low end DSLR kit lens but this one will most likely take a lot better pictures. Consider that most Point and shoots and even low end interchangeable lens cameras have a sensor that is approximately 1/3 to 1/2 inch sensors verses the RX100 with a 1 inch sensor. It's like comparing the old film 35mm cameras to the APS-C size film cameras.And for those that want to do a lot of post-processing, the RX100 can save the pictures in JPEG and RAW at the same time.Updated Review:Absolutely impressive point and shoot that exceeds performance and quality of lots of DSLRs.I'm a Pro-sumer with extensive photography experience with Nikon and Canon SLRs and DSLR. My crown jewel is a Nikon F2AS with MD-2 motor drive (for those that go back to the film days, still takes great pictures).Granted if you setup your camera for a specific shot, a DSLR like the new Nikon D7000 will get better results but with the HX-20V, it is very easy to take a very good picture. The HX-20 results in a better picture than you expected when you took the picture. I was actually going to buy the Nikon D7000, until I played with the HX-20V. I may still buy the Nikon D7000 when the price comes down a little (now around $1400).The HX-20 has a lot more capability and performance than my HX-5V that I've been using for travel and snap shots.It automatically adjusts for the various lighting conditions for the picture. Especially amazing is the 20x zoom (500mm telephoto), with anti-blur capability that I used to take a picture of Clayton Kershaw (Dodgers) from the last seat way above the stands on the third base side. With the 20x zoom I got a full frame stop motion picture of Clayton just as he released the ball. Just a hint of blur from his hand and ball. That's a ball going around 100mph at release.Also, the low light capability without flash is amazing with very good skin tones. Specialty shots like e.g., on the Las Vegas strip is great where it takes consecutive shots and blends the dark background shots and the bright close in shots (with flash) of people and combines the shots into a very good composite picture with clear background. I use to take shots with a Canon DSLR and had to photoshop the same type of shots to bring out the background to match the people in the foreground. A big pain and still does not produce as good a quality picture as the HX-20.There are an abundance of additional capabilities that I have not mentioned.The one last point is a complaint I hear from friends that say a point and shoot cannot select manual mode like F stop and speed (like the new Canon S100 can), but on the HX, you can do both unlike most point and shoots.If you are considering getting the HX, don't get the HX-10, which is a mild update of the HX-9 with the new sensor. The HX-20 and HX-30 are completely new cameras with a lot more capability and performance. I'd say you get a lot more camera if you compare it with a DSLR like the Canon T3i/T4i and Nikon D-5100. The kit lens from these DSLRs are only (3x, 18-55mm), which is way less than HX-20 zoom (20x, 25-500mm). If you really want a DSLR go get a Canon 60Da or a Nikon D-7000.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.  Better than the HX9V in many ways.", "Author": "Rolla Gravett \"Rolla Gravett\"", "ReviewID": "R1HI6Q5LLSYX3P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony makes a great point and shoot camera.  I already have the HX9V, and just bought the HX20V.  There are a lot of differences and improvements to the new camera.  I have several Panasonic Cameras and have the new Panasonic ZS20 20X point and shoot camera as well.  I like some things about the Panasonic, such as the priority modes and the different burst rates.  The Sony is unbeatable in video and low light shooting.  When set to iAuto plus in low light the camera takes 6 pictures and combines them into one photo.  The result is hard to beat.  In daylight conditions the Sony and Panasonic take excellent pictures and it is hard to call a winner.  With the Sony you can do a burst of 10 shots, but that is it.  Then it starts downloading them.  With the Panasonic you can do a burst of 10 pictures at 10 frames per second, wait a second, do another burst of 8, wait a second do another burst of 8, and so on.  In the 5 fps Auto focus mode the camera will take 100 shots without stopping at the 5 fps rate.  Below is the main differences between the Sony HX9V and the Sony HX20V.The differences between the two cameras.  The HX20V is better in these ways.Video still image size can be set at 13mp or 3mp picture size.  The HX9V has 3mp picture size only.3 way stabilization instead of 2GPS loading much faster and it works insideBetter videoBetter picturesAperture and Shutter controls much easier to use in ManualOn/Off switch much easier to useGPS LoggingLive mode in  iA and iA plus  Can adjust Brightness, Color, and Vividness.  Also several other modes are available.  Part Y (yellow), Part B (blue), and Part G (green) and Part R (red) are available.  If set for Part G (Green) for  example, the picture will be black and white except for anything Green in the photo.  The same goes for the other colors or parts.

The camera will take 10 shots at 10fps.  Also has self timer for 1 person or two people but HX9V has that as well.Big difference.  Once you set the self timer,  say for 2 seconds, it will remember that for each picture till you turn the timer off.  You don't have to program the self timer after each picture like you do with the HX9V.  It stays at a self timer of 2 seconds even if you shut off the camera.Manual Mode  Aperture can be set to either f/3.2 or f/8.  The Shutter can be set from 30 seconds to 1/1600 second.Aperture f/3.2 vs f/3.3 for HX9VFlash works much better in the HX20V.  It does not overexpose like the flash on the HX9V does.The focus is much faster.The time for video to start running after pushing the video button is much faster.20X zoom verses 16X for the HX9VMain Dial much easier to move.  One thumb is all you need.  To move the dial on the HX9V I needed two fingers.Features of both the Sony HX9V and HX20V  Great low light shooting in the iA + (plus) mode.  The camera takes 6 pictures and puts them together in a single shot.  The pictures in low light look well lit and with no or little noise.  SCN Mode  Great HDR mode  Panoramic Mode can't be beat.  Can set the camera for HD Panoramic picture.  Book says the file size is 46mb.  Shoot in the Portrait mode for the largest pictures.  Soft Snap to blur the background with the object in sharp focus.  A really cool feature.  Night Portrait.  Great for a picture of someone with a lit background.  Night Scene.  Great low light shots with a tripod  Hand Held Twilight.  Great for low light shots with no tripod.  The camera takes 6 shots and produces one picture from them.  The output is fantastic with low noise and excellent low light shots.Many controls in the Program Mode.  You can select Vivid and add more contrast, color and sharpness in that mode.  The ISO can be set to as high as ISO 12,800.  I normally set the ISO in Auto and let the camera decide what it needs.There may be more differences between these two cameras.  Both are great and have more controls on the picture than most point and shoot cameras have.  You can't go wrong with either one.", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "20x Pocket Zoom Comparison - Sony HX20V vs. Panasonic ZS19 vs. Canon SX260", "Author": "Artemaria", "ReviewID": "R1GRU944FBHUDS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I couldn't decide between these three cameras (and their variants, the Sony HX30 and the Panasonic ZX20) because many of the reviews of each made the cameras sound very similar. So, I went out and bought (from merchants who accepted returns) one of each of these three cameras (I didn't need WI-FI or GPS, so that's how I settled on these less expensive variants). And then I took photos and videos in various conditions. I am not a professional photographer, and I didn't do Imatest or any other specific tests on the images (you can read C/net for that), but this is an experience of a regular person who was taking pictures and videos with these three cameras side by side, which is a comparison that you do not often see.The bottom line is that these three cameras are very similar with a few minor differences, but those differences set them apart and may make you decide that you like one more than the other.Generally speaking, NONE of these cameras is a DSLR replacement. Whomever writes that the pictures are as good as a DSLR is not speaking accurately. Also, none of the cameras is a replacement for a high end camcorder.OUTSIDE PICTURESIf you are taking pictures outside on a sunny day all of these cameras will take very nice pictures for small to medium enlargements (no bigger than 8 x 10). The cameras all produce nice fairly sharp images that would be well suited for that purpose. And, like most people, I don't remember ever enlarging a picture more than 8 x 10, so it is not a common problem.What might be an issue is if you are zoomed in all the way and wanted to crop a photo (which sometimes happens), the differences in the way the cameras' photos look when you \"pixel peep\" might make a difference. In good light outside, the cameras were close, but the best photos were from the CANON with the SONY and the PANASONIC a close second.INSIDE PICTURES - GOOD LIGHTIf you are inside and you are taking pictures in low light, you will see a different story. Again, at smaller sized prints 4x6, 5x7, most people will see almost no difference between the pictures of the three cameras other than the PANASONIC's colors are a little less vibrant than those in the CANON and the SONY. I am not sure whether those colors are less accurate, they are just a little less vivid.If you pixel peep at these pictures, the CANON's photos are clearly the best with the PANASONIC's being second. The CANON's remain very sharp through a good amount of enlargement while the PANASONIC's, although close, get softer a little faster. The SONY's pictures inside with good light became soft rather quickly and, I'm not sure if this is because the SONY has 18MP on a small chip (as some of the tech reviewers write), but there is a \"watercolor\" effect where after you enlarge it a little bit, it looks like a Claude Manet painting.INSIDE PICTURES - LOW LIGHTIn poor light, the hierarchy between the cameras remains the same, but there is less of a gap between the CANON and the PANASONIC. It seems as if the CANON takes somewhat worse pictures in low light, and the PANASONIC just doesn't get that much worse. As a result, the gap between these two becomes somewhat closer. The SONY's pictures remain the poorest of the three in low light.VIDEO - OUTSIDE GOOD LIGHTAll three cameras take very nice video outside in good light. If you are editing or nitpicky, you will note that the SONY and the PANASONIC take 60 frames per second, which is somewhat easier to edit, than the 24 frames per second that the CANON records. While you have to look for it, the CANON's outside video does have a couple of instances where it seems to be a tad jerky compared to the SONY and PANASONIC's video. But you really have to look for it and most people won't notice if you don't have another video outside for comparison.While all the outdoor video is close, I would give the edge to the SONY in video, with the PANASONIC second and the CANON third. But they are close for outside video.VIDEO - INSIDETaking video inside is a different story. Inside, the SONY shines and clearly has the best video. The video from this camera is actually good. It is not professional level by any stretch, but it is good solid quite viewable video from a camera that takes still pictures.There is a noticeable difference on indoor video between the SONY and the PANASONIC. This difference was perhaps most noticeable to me because I had both videos from both cameras and watched them over and over again looking for differences. While the difference is noticeable, it is not a tremendous difference. The SONY video is super smooth and seems to get as much out of the light as it can. The PANASONIC video also is smooth and gets a good contrast tone and color out of the available light, but is slightly less smooth than the SONY. The PANASONIC video is still very viewable and looks good, but not as good as the SONY.The CANON will take decent indoor video in good light, but in poor light, it just seems to struggle. The CANON's video had many shadows and dark areas that simply were not present in the SONY and PANASONIC videos. I did not notice any hissing in the CANON video as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. This may be an issue that varies from camera to camera.HANDLING AND SPEEDThis was a fairly subjective comparison between the three cameras as to how they felt in the hand and how quickly the camera did what I wanted it to do because if the camera doesn't take the shot when you want to, it doesn't really matter how sharp the picture or video might be.Based on my experience, the PANASONIC had the best handling of the three. While the PANASONIC and the SONY were both quick to take a picture, for some reason the SONY that I had would take a much longer time (seconds) to record the picture onto the card. This was despite the fact that both cameras had comparable cards with comparable write speeds. Both the SONY and the PANASONIC had rather quick autofocus which also made them seem to react faster. The PANASONIC is noticeably thinner and lighter than the SONY while maintaining a similar full raised rubber grip on the front which made the camera easier to handle. While both the SONY and the PANASONIC were quick, the blazingly fast (by comparison) write speeds on the PANASONIC compared with its almost non-existent shutter lag made this the best handling camera of the three by far.Even though it consistently took the best pictures, the CANON was the worst handling camera. The autofocus often had issues focusing and there was a constant shutter lag while it was searching for its focus. We did miss some shots because the CANON was so slow to react. Also, the CANON is somewhere in weight between the SONY and the PANASONIC, but has the worst grip of the three. That little rubber strip on the front is not as effective a grip as the fuller grip that appears on the SONY and the PANASONIC.With respect to handling, I've read many reviews and each of them seems to state different things about each of the cameras. Many of these reviews seem to indicate that the SONY is a very fast camera, and that might be the case, but the write speed of the 18 MP pictures (which are 50% larger than the CANON's photos and almost the same for the PANASONIC) was so slow, it was distracting and detracted from the experience of using the camera.VERDICT AND CONCLUSIONSNone of these cameras is the best at everything. The CANON has the best pictures, but is slow to focus, somewhat awkward to handle and has the worst video of the three. The SONY handles okay but is heavy and has noticeably slow write speeds, its picture quality varies greatly with the light (and will deteriorate rapidly with any significant cropping) but the SONY has the best video, and it is noticeable.In the end I decided to go with the PANASONIC. While it only was the best in handling, to me that was a significant portion of the photographic experience. It is not DSLR fast (instantaneous), but it is a zippy camera for a superzoom, is light in weight and has a good grip which makes it easier to hold. Also, it does not have a pop-up flash which I found always seemed to come up under my fingers where I was holding the left side camera. As noted above, the PANASONIC's videos were good, perhaps not as good as the SONY, but the PANASONIC was certainly capable of capturing some nice video, even in low light. The photos also were not as good as the CANON's, but they were close and very close in low light. With respect to the vibrancy of the colors, if you set the photo vibrancy on the PANASONIC to \"happy\" (which I guess is their \"vivid\") it is less of a noticeable difference. The photos look very nice and certainly are competitive in quality for this type of camera.Hopefully this comparison and these observations will help you decide between these three similar cameras so you can choose the best one for your needs.

You still need to set flash if you don't havethe flash on auto.2nd mode Don't use the gold camera (auto plus) mode. It is suppose togive you a better shot in low light because it take multiple picturesand blends them together. All my pictures look very grainy with lossof detail.3td mode The program mode (P) is useful if you want to manually adjustISO, white balance, focus, light meter, bracket setting for EV, colormode, picture effect. I will use this mode to get accurate colors. Setthe color mode to real\"R\" instead of standard. I also use this mode toget great sunsets. Set the light meter to \"spot\". I also like thismode in low light situations. I can fix the ISO to 400 which gives youa less grainy picture but it will lengthen the shutter speed.

Of course it's all about comparisons.  I had a Sony alpha-NEX5 with the huge APC sensor that took amazing pictures so rich they raised your cholesterol just looking at them.  It did amazing HDR sunsets that got me dozens of likes on Flickr. But the thing was like an albatross  around my neck and to carry a long lens you need a wheelbarrow. I went hiking with my daughter where we saw sea otters, eagles, and osprey and her tiny little Canon SX230HS made glorius sharp pics showing the otter laughing at us and my Sony showed a little gray dot in the water.  Sold the Sony NEX- bought a Canon SX230.  Great telephoto. Crisp color but NO shadow detail.  I missed my HDR.  Then I read about this camera and just bought one.  In 4 days I have taken 300 pics.  Some of them beautiful.  Here is what I think:Pro-Wonderful Zoom. Amazing close ups.  You would pay $5000 for a SLR that does this.Superior Auto  as well as Intelligent Auto relieves you of ever having to make a decision.  Just shoot- they work great.Pretty good resolution for a tiny sensor.Pretty versatile scene select and manual mode if you really want to fiddle. (Food mode is excellent).Con-HDR mode really sucks- oops (sorry)-  I mean it does NOT make pretty pictures.  The iPhone does a better job.Camera is a little fat and heavy to be a true pocket camera.Slow start up and shut down.  Slow to zoom.Superior auto is really slow to save the shot- 5-7 seconds?Burst mode only takes 10 pics.  This is actually important if you take pictures of things that move like people, pets or wildlife.

One reviewer stated the following ...\"The lighting that the camera requires for video is much higher than that required for still photos, and is about double that of the usual camcorder ...\".I thought so also, but when you try fluorescent lights instead of incandescents it works very well for video (with actually less light).  The problem is not really one of not having enough light but the fact that the auto white balance does not seem to work well on the video setting.  It seems to default to a white balance setting for the fluorescent lighting.  Furthermore, you cannot change the white balance when in Movie (video) mode.  That makes skin tones and overall color tones on the indoor videos look way too reddish.  Once I used the fluorescent lights (I use studio soft boxes) instead, the high def videos looked great ... even in the 28Mbps 60P mode.  Very impressive ... now if they would add an external mic jack I could have pro sound along with the pro level video capabilities and I would not have to take a camcorder along to capture video for smaller projects.  Other than that, I am very happy with the camera, which I will use primarily for video, and am glad I tried it with the other type of lights. The still image aspects of the camera are impressive except that there is a little softness when you zoom down on the image you captured.  But unless you plan on blowing up an enlargement beyond 11x17 it will probably not be a factor.  Good color saturation, but I think the default is set to \"Standard\".  Using the \"Real\" setting (with dial mode set to \"P\") will get you a better color ... more realistic to what you actually see with your eyes.  I use the \"P\" mode for everything as then I can let the auto select the iris and shutter but I have control over other aspects.  For all up close outdoor faces in bright sunlight, for example, I always force the flash and position about 4 feet from the subjects.  This lights the face and makes a pro shot instead of faces in shadows being drowned out by the background lighting.  Another pleasant feature is that the little guy records some pretty good audio during the video recording.  Overall, it's a good buy for the money and gets video on par with some $1,000 camcorders that I have.  It would have been a five star review except for the noted white balance problem in video.Review Update August 10 2012 ... discovered I had manually set white balance wrong so only Auto worked with proper white balance.  Video now seems to be okay for white balance as long as you set the MR settings to AWB to automatically set it. I would now go with 5 stars.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really nice camera", "Author": "R.

It seems each brand of camera has their positives, so you gain something good with one brand, but give up something with another.  I ended up with the Sony because of its hands down, review consensus that it does HD video the best for a point and shoot camera.The optical zoom this camera has is incredible.  Of course, at 20x, you may want a tripod, but it may not be necessary due to the incredible shake control the camera has, an option you can adjust.  Taking images at 20x can be difficult though.Image quality is very nice. One thing I noticed when trying to take images during dusk at a soccer game was the camera did much better when set to intelligent mode than the generic P mode.  The images were more color saturated, sharper, and better focused. I have played a little with the HDR option.  It doesn't seem to be adjustable, however, it does improve the exposure in the images nicely.  Don't expect results you may see online where people go to town with the HDR and create painting like images.  This HDR mode manages the low and high ends of light exposure within an image, where digital cameras struggle.  It balances them very nicely and you'll end up with a very nice photo.Image quality in the dark is superb.  Sometimes the camera can hit the spot perfectly on its own, or you can set the cameras ISO in lower light conditions to try and track the best exposure.  I was very happy with the low light quality, without needing a flash.  I typically try avoiding the use of the flash.The LCD screen is very good and the quality really sticks out when you switch to recording a video in HD.  The clarity on the view screen in incredible!  The zoom on HD recording is also great and sharp.  You can record movies in a number of resolutions which can help extend the recording time, as 1080p is a hog on memory.  Each of the resolutions look great.  It is also great to be able to take high quality images while recording a movie.Megapixel-wise, you may be best off reducing the size of the photo one step from 18 Megapixel, unless you plan on printing large images from them.  Otherwise, 18 MP creates needlessly large images.As to battery life, I haven't used the GPS yet, so I don't know how much of a drag that is (others report it does significantly reduce the battery life).  However, I have had little trouble getting through a day of pictures and movie taking without needing to change the battery.Speed of the camera is very good.  It takes two to three seconds to go from off to ready.  If you are using an enhancing mode for the pictures, you will need to wait a couple seconds between shots.  If you are taking regular images (P, S, M modes), you should be able to take near continuous shots.The manual mode is decent, though you only have two aperture settings to choose from, which will limit your options.My main beef with the camera is the USB access location.  It is located on the base on the camera, which means if you want to charge or transfer images, you need the camera to be laying on its back so the cable can hook into the camera.  I kept the little bag that the camera comes in and place it on that to help protect the LCD view screen when transferring images or charging the camera.Overall, I am very happy with this camera.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "DUST inside the camera once a year", "Author": "R\u00fcdiger \"res80\"", "ReviewID": "R3T3I3IZB0JLPU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Initially, I was very pleased by the image quality of the camera.However, after a few months I noticed some dust inside the camera, so I sent it to repair in Austria (where I lived at that time).Repair was within warranty so free of charge.However, the dust inside re-appeared one year later, now Sony asks for 150$ to clean this camera again (here in the US).This is insane, I am not going to pay 150$ per year for an error that seems to be a design error of the camera (as a lot of people complain about that dust inside this camera on the internet).Sorry, Sony, this was my first and last camera from your company.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nearly Perfect!!", "Author": "M.

As far as the rest of the camera goes, I think it's really great!  This is replacing a Panasonic Lumix TZ4 that I bought about four years ago.  A fine camera, but the Lumix had a similar problem in that the recording mic was placed on the top left side.  I'm glad the stereo mics on the Sony are placed in the center where they belong.  Being a compact camera crammed with lots of features, inevitably there must be some sort of compromise as to where some items get placed on the exterior of the camera body.Photo quality of the Sony is very good.  The panorama mode couldn't be easier.  The macro mode is excellent.  I'm looking forward to trying the video and 10fps burst modes.  It didn't take very long to get familiar with the location of settings in the menus.  Having a user guide built into the camera, and on-screen descriptions of the different settings and modes is a definite plus!There are simply too many features for me to mention in a brief review.  You just want to see a positive review to help you decide if this is the right camera for you.  I've read countless reviews on cameras like this one is the past few weeks.  I take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  Some folks either get a lemon, or they didn't  take the time to read the manual to understand how it to get good results. My main criteria was a 20x optical zoom, great photo quality, great quality 1080p video/stereo sound, relatively compact size, and ease of use.  I looked at Canon, Nikon, and Panasonic. All very similar, and each with their own merits, but the Sony has met and exceeded my requirements.

I consider myself a relatively advanced amateur photographer, have done dive photography, etc.Just got back and checked out the pictures - they're amazing.  The quality of the 20x zoom on this camera is incredible for a camera this small.  I had the camera on \"idiot\" auto mode most of the time (hadn't had time to really learn all it's features) and it took some great shots in really challenging lighting conditions - early morning low light, afternoon w/heavy shadows, night shots, full zoom while the jeep was moving, animals moving fast, etc.  Also took some video and the 1080p quality again is incredible for a camera that fits in my pocket (actually wish I'd have taken more video).Online reviews totally push the Canon PowerShot SX260HS as by far the best in this category - but my sister had purchased it earlier this year and had big issues with it handling the correct exposure w/heavy shadows/bright light conditions and the video quality is so-so - thus I went with this camera.

Schrader", "ReviewID": "R2QT6K8C93ZIBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As you are probably doing right now, I researched many, many cameras to find out which ones I would be interested in checking out in person. I am not a pro photographer, just someone who loves to take photos of friends and family, as well as games, beautiful locations and nature.While I do know how to use a manual camera, it's just not practical for casual use anymore and I wanted something simple and quick so that anyone in my family could pick it up and enjoy. I was tired of hearing \"take the picture already\" from family waiting for my 1 fps digital to reset, so I wanted something that would have a quick processing speed  so that I could actually take shots at sporting events and moving subjects.After picking five favorites, I went to the local Best Buy and looked at each of them. This Sony was the clear winner for many reasons, and here is the rundown:EASE OF USE:The camera is extremely user friendly and this is what truly sold me on it. The in-camera menu is awesome! Imagine having a tiny computer available at all times to guide you on how to use your camera in all of its modes, with FAQs, pointers, and *gasp* a real tutorial/instruction manual right in your hands instead of in a bulky book or CD. Turn the camera on, look at the screen and find whatever you want to get started.I instantly began shooting in various modes and had a handy guide showing me step by step what the camera is capable of. I have owned cameras that have multiple functions, but never had the patience to read up on it, decipher the info and actually use it effectively.The camera top wheel for selecting modes, as well as the buttons at the side of the screen are easy to manipulate and clearly marked. The screen features are easy to read, slightly easier inside than in sunlight, but still visible outdoors.For those who choose to, there is a manual mode. I only dabbled with it since it's not my priority for this camera, but it is available if you want to have more control/experimentation.SPEED:The second biggest reason why I picked this camera was the processing speed. There are various burst settings (taking anywhere from two to six pics in succession) and even the single photos took minimal time to process and recover for another shot. I can now get live shots of people and animals without the frustration of waiting for the camera to be ready for me.PHOTO QUALITY:Obviously, no matter how easy a camera is to use, it's no good if the results are not fabulous pictures. This Sony creates great, clear pics and there are multiple settings available to customize the way you want your photos to look. I tried every setting on the same subject (my friendly local chipmunk)and every one of them came out fantastic. Again, I am not a pro photographer, so I do not break down the photos into super specifics, all I can say is that the color looks true, outlines crisp and people are smiling in my shots because I can capture quick, candid moments like never before.SIZE:This is not a tiny pocket camera, like many on the market, but it has a nice feel/weight to it and is still very comfortable to hold. Actual size is about 5\" wide/1.5\" deep. The size is actually a positive for me since many of the teeny cameras had difficult to use buttons or touch screens that I hoped to avoid.ZOOM:The 20x optical zoom is quick and has good capability even at those long distances. For example, I got a shot of a dove perched about 300 feet away using the full zoom and the result is sharp and detailed.MEMORY AND BATTERY:The Sony has built in memory, but we bought a high-speed memory card to make the most of the camera's capabilities and to have lots of room for pics without worrying about running out of space until the next download. The battery lasts forever (well not literally, of course) and we did not have to plug back in until after multiple uses and hundreds of shots.MODES:There is auto, super-auto, defocus, illustration, etc. There are so many choices of how you want your photos to appear and clear directions (in camera!) on how to use each one, so enjoy some creativity. Each one was interesting and slightly different, fun experiment with.Overall, I have just loved the ease of use and resulting great shots of this camera.

Almost did not buy it as it was not available until very recently.Here are some nice things about this camera:- At 20x, of course it bets out my old 10x anytime.

Great zoom, great video, fit easily in my pocket, nice auto mode and nice macro.  Many hundreds of family shots, parties, vacations, never let me down.A few months ago, I bought an Olympus XZ-1 (here at Amazon, a \"used like new\" for <$200).  I used it at a few parties, and for my daughter's prom and graduation.  When I actually compared the image quality, with my old ZS3, I was blown away.  The amount of improvement really surprised me.Except for two things: video quality (the XZ-1 focus hunts a lot during video), and of course lack of zoom (this mattered at the graduation ceremony).I expected those, so they weren't really disappointments (I had planned to keep the ZS3 for those purposes), but the amount of improvement in other areas made me start thinking about a ZS3 replacement.  I did more research, and started leaning towards the HX20V (bigger zoom and supposedly excellent video).  Then I spotted a demo unit for $150 (off e bay, sorry Amazon) and bought it.  The research didn't mislead me:FAST - it does everything fast: turn on, focus, shutter, video operation.ZOOM - there are cameras with longer zoom, but the 20x optical, plus digital (actually works pretty well) give me a big improvement over the ZS3.VIDEO - excellent, even in low light.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a video camera.One thing that did surprise me: the camera itself is physically almost identical to my old ZS3.  Same size, same button placement, same LCD screen size, even the lens cover is the same.  It's a little heavier than my old ZS3, but hardly noticeable.  The lens is more centrally placed (which helps a little for macro shots), and the mode dial is dropped into a recess - which was my one annoyance with my old ZS3: that I would accidentally knock the dial to a different mode (did this often when I dropped it in my pocket), very nice improvement.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING CAMERA", "Author": "Jean Carlos", "ReviewID": "R214A36IWGZP6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw the quality of recording on a video on youtube from Madonna's MDNA Tour in Abu DHabi and th definition and ZOOM was AMAZING the ambiental mic sounds great, with bass and lows.

Idiosyncrasies, though...", "Author": "Dr. Cherokee", "ReviewID": "R3606VZMWUDWTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All in all, this is a great camera.  If you're especially keen on taking great 1080 60p video without using a camcorder (and still preserve the ability to take great photos), and price is not an issue, strongly consider the HX20V.A little on terminology: 1080 means \"1920x1080\" and is the pixel resolution, and 60p means \"60 progressive\" and is the framerate or temporal resolution.  60p \"60 progressive\" essentially means 60 full frames per second, whereas 60i \"60 interlaced\" means 60 half-frames per second.  60i is not the same as 30p, but it's similar.  That goes beyond the scope of this review.Anyway, I've been a Canon camera aficionado for many years and I hesitated to buy a Sony.  The Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) is a great looking camera and quite a bit cheaper than this camera as of December 2012.  That's a consideration.  The SX260 does not take 1080 video at 60 frames, but 1080 at only 24 frames.  That was a deal-breaker for me.  Some people may want the slower 24p movie-style framerate.  If that's not a deal-breaker for you, then you'll save a good deal of money going with the Canon.  If you want awesome 1080 60p video in a small size, this may be for you.It does have a some small idiosyncrasies, and since the instructions are woefully inadequate I'd like to discuss one.  This involves photo and video numbering on the camera and behavior via Windows 7.  I assume other versions of Windows act similarly, and I don't know about Mac.**Photo Importing**First of all, no matter how you import photos, they're numbered sequentially and NEVER reset in sequence unless you instruct the camera to do so.  DSC00001.jpg, DSC00002.jpg, etc.  You can import them through Windows or through proprietary Sony PlayMemories software (which is downloadable for free).  BOTH work fine for importing photos.  The \"Date Taken\" and EXIF metadata (the EXIF contains GPS data if you turn GPS on) is always there and correct no matter how you import.**Video Importing in Windows**(I've only used the 1080 60p, but I assume the other formats are the same.)  If you import videos through Windows, or view them directly by file browsing the camera, you'll notice that they'll ALWAYS reset in sequence at 000000.mts after erased from the memory card or the memory card is changed.  For example, if you import videos through Windows after recording 4 videos, you'll get 000000.mts, 000001.mts, 000002.mts, 000003.mts.  Erase and record 4 more.  Same exact names.  You can just import them into different folders, but with the same file names it could get confusing.  In addition, GPS data for videos won't be imported.  On the positive side, the \"Date\" metadata will be correct under Windows.  The moral of the story for me is to not import videos using the Windows importing feature!**Video Importing in PlayMemories**For the videos, when you import using the proprietary PlayMemories software, you will get two files for each video.  One is the actual video, with the name itself labeled with the date and time you took it (20121130184709.mt2s would be 2012 November 30 and military time 18:47 and 09 seconds) and another file with the exact same name but with the extension \".modd\" after it.  As far as I can tell, the \".modd\" file has all the metadata.  That includes GPS, so don't delete it.  I'm not sure if any software other than PlayMemories can directly read those \".modd\" files, but you can view them as a text file for that metadata.  On the negative side, the \"Date\" metadata and all related metadata (\"Date Created\" \"Date Taken\") in Windows will be the date you imported it, not the date you took it.  (Remember, the photos--unlike videos--NEVER start over unless you instruct the camera to reset the sequence.)**Summary**I'd rather have a unique file name (and GPS data) than the correct Windows \"Date\" metadata, but it's still aggravating--especially considering the inconsistent behaviors between video and photo importing/naming.  It's easier to import everything at once, so I import all through the PlayMemories software: videos and photos.I hope this review helps some of you figure out how to use this camera, because it's a great one.  Don't let this review dissuade you.  This camera has fantastic video, great photos, and it's nearly flawless.  Final note: the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model) is essentially this camera with wi-fi.  At the time of this writing, it's quite a bit more expensive.  Unless you MUST have wi-fi transmission of photos (and I personally only use \"old-school\" moving of photos via SD cards) then I'd save your hard-earned money and go with the HX20V.

Since buying the HX20V I have greatly enjoyed the still photo capabilities of this product, but for purposes of this review I want to emphasize the video.  As others have noted, the hi-def quality of the video output is absolutely beautiful.  But what perhaps is even more impressive is the image stabilization.  I didn't realize quite how great this is until today, when I took video of my dog while walking (fast) beside her on a rough trail.  The image stabilization smoothed things out so the result was totally watchable - and this from someone who gets seasick at movies shot with handheld cameras.It's true that, as compared with a dedicated video camcorder, the HX20V has very limited control availability:  the EV is about the only thing that's adjustable.  Not even manual focus is available, although it's not a big problem because the camera can do \"tracking focus\" - e.g., focus on a person even as the person moves about in the frame.  For documenting everyday events, vacations, etc., I think the HX20V will do just fine.I should point out that there are two image stabilization modes available when taking video:  the regular optical stabilization, and optical plus electronic stabilization (Sony calls it Active Mode).  I've only used Active Mode (which is the default setting), so I can't say how effective optical alone is.  I'm not aware of a downside to using Active Mode other than I think the wide angle end of the zoom is not quite as wide -- I'm guessing because part of the sensor is reserved for use by the stabilization system.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Overall Camera", "Author": "MattM", "ReviewID": "R3KKH6AK6F9DRP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Camera has so many features its way to difficult to learn to use them all. However The features I wanted I figured out and left the rest to the automatic mode.  My absolute favorite feature is the GPS automatic geotagging. It took a few minutes to figure out to to set it up, but the manual is pretty straight forward and works well here. It seems to have a very accurate position, and is capable of locating multiple satellites. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to get signal and locate its position, so your not gonna whip it out of your pocket and start shooting with geotags. The other drawback is that theres no indoor positioning. Once it looses signal its over. So far I've been about 50/50 inside for keeping GPS signal. Some people have reported a low battery life, and I have experienced dead battery a few times on long tour days, after shooting about 150+ pics with the GPS on all day. I do wish it would last all day, but I realize thats unrealistic, my phone battery drains quick with the GPS left on. it has a wall charger and USB charge cable as well.The picture quality is fabulous the 20x zoom is clear and works very well. We also have a Sony NEX-3, which is suppose to have the SLR quality lens, and many of the same features, I just ordered the HX-30V for my wife to replace it. Biggest notable drawback to me on the newest Sony cameras is the display. It is plastic and very susceptible to light scratching. The NEX -3 frequently gets tossed into a purse on the fly and the screen is very scratched(but totally usable) and my HX-20V is starting to as well.  I would recommend a neoprene sac to protect it.

While I was impressed with the reviews on some of the Canon and Panasonic models, when I actually tried out models at a store, the Sony had the highest quality, with a zoom far clearer than I could see with the naked eye! In picture quality and heft, it stood out from other point and shoot cameras.UPDATE December 2012:The picture quality continues to be wonderful and the auto-correct (five pictures merged into one) is helpful if you're too lazy to manually adjust photos taken in low-light. An annoyance: you have to go to scene settings to get landscape or micro mode (!)And an even bigger concern: I just looked at the video for the first time and the quality is terrible - jumps and freezes and striated lines. I'm using a SanDisk 8GB SDHC card, a brand that's always worked for me before.

Even at max zoom, there is almost no jerkiness evident. If this is important for you, this camera won't disappoint.This camera replaces a Panasonic Lumix ZS6, where this was not the case, not to mention poor low-light performance. The Sony is a big improvement in both these areas.This is not to say it's perfect. Dim light and movement sometimes result in blur, even in Auto+ mode. But perhaps 85% of the time it works fine. The 3-4 second delay after taking a shot in Auto+ is a tad annoying, though, especially when it fails to get you a clear picture. But the Plus/Gold mode can give amazing results in dim light, although watercolored.The pictures are very good, although the reds in some of them seem a little more vivid than I would expect. Pictures in dim light have a bit of noise and a watercolor effect on close inspection due to the smoothing of several images taken at once, but better than what you'd get without this system (or lugging around a much larger camera). Actually you may notice this in regular photos as well, but nothing too disturbing unless, perhaps, you print it in a really large format. Generally, it's intelligent auto mode is much better than what we've experienced on the Panasonic, which never seemed to know what was going on at all. It's usually enough to leave it in auto mode, unless you want to fool around with the different scene modes, which we don't.The Burst Mode is fantastic - 10 shots, and mostly clear, at full 18.2 megapixels.The Defocus feature is hit and miss. Although it tells you the distance needed, it sometimes fails even though you are at the correct distance. I may be doing something wrong to cause this, but of what I am still unaware.Haven't tried the 3D yet, since we don't have a 3D TV ... although the camera lets you view it on the LCD somewhow. Will update later.The display is large, clear and bright; no complaints here.The flash pops up on the top left. Something to get used to.You can't take pictures or video while it's charging.The camera feels ... plastic. There are strategically-placed, flat areas and grips for thumb and fingers, but overall it feels like a toy, although I like most of the styling. The dial is a nice touch, although it, too, feels like light, cheap plastic.They could have included a battery charger. Charging via the USB port on the bottom just looks and feels clunky. Luckily, spare battery and charger are under $30 here.The manual is short on detail, leaving you to the camera's Help system, which is decent.Otherwise, for the casual photographer (that's us), or someone who wants a good point-and-shoot, this camera takes what you want most of the time, with the option of really stable video.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "great pictures as long as you don't look to close", "Author": "s", "ReviewID": "R1CG0T1K8HG7JS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "if you plan on doing a lot of cropping or big printing the picture really falls to pieces. horrible artifacts. looks like a water color painting", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Took good pictures while it lasted", "Author": "TA", "ReviewID": "R2167M6DQSC7I4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this for a Christmas present in 2012, died in Sept 2013.....

Got back form a trip from Ireland and we couldn't decide between a lot of the shots taken between this and our DSLR.  In landscapes, we loved shots from this camera - color was so rich and the focus was incredibly sharp even when zooming in or printing out the images.  It was even responsible for taking the poster shot of the trip - quite literally, we've blown it up and printed b/c it was our favorite shot.Additionally, there are some really handy features that you can quickly access.  The tracking focus is m favorite - you put the object you want in focus in the center, hit the tracking button, and then can pan away from the object while the camera tracks it keeping it in perfect focus while letting you really get a great depth to you shot.Using this in addition with the \"defocus\" option lets you really take some DSLResque photos.  I'm sure a true pro could tell the difference, but my wife and I thought they really enhance the depth of field in a number of shots.  If you don't want to break the bank, but do want to start a food blog, this camera would be a great starting option for you food close-ups!I like the form factor a lot.  The build feels very solid, and can be confidently used to snap photos while only holding it in one hand.Moving onto the critical feedback, the user interface is very kludgy.  I had a canon point and shoot before this and I found it much more intuitive, maybe that is b/c these cameras have become so feature rich over the past few years, but I think a lot of the manual settings are difficult to update.  Fortunately, many of the automatic settings/modes can be tweaked enough to get the shot you want without having to dive too deep into the configuration.On extraneous feature is 3D - I have no 3D enabled products at my house so I can't say how good this can be, but I do look forward looking at the random shots I take in 3D with the hopes that one day, these will look awesome.

Shortly after buying we took a vacation that included wildlife viewing, as a result we were able to put the camera through its paces. Dead simple, with great quality, to use in auto mode.  In absence of an optical view finder, she was able to adjust using the LCD just fine. LCD screen was bright enough in sunny conditions. One of the biggest advantages of the new camera is it overall size, very compact given its zoom capabilities.  As other users have commented the flash is not in a optimal spot. However, given the size and weight of the camera it is not too hard to adjust your hand position when needed. Purchased a 64GB (class 10) SD card from a local retailer, camera response time was good. Battery held up for each days shooting, though did purchase a 2nd after market battery for around $10. In general I would say that my picture's usually turn out better than my wife's. Now that she has the Soncy HX20V I would not say that is the case. Color depth in her pictures is noticeable often, but particularly when the lighting conditions are a more challenging. Very nice that they have loaded in the user manual into memory, handy when you want to look up a feature you use infrequently. When the budget allows we will most likely be buying a second one.

It seems like I can't hardly take a bad picture anymore.  I've always owned the middle to lower end kind of cameras, pretty basic features, lower mp's, and fairly automatic.  So, if you compare the Sony with some of my older cameras, you notice quite a difference.  I sure have.  It is so simple to begin using that I didn't even have to look at the manual first.  You choose a setting (portrait, auto, landscape, etc) and start taking pictures.  It's that simple.I've recently got a higher-end camera and it is fantastic!

The size is perfect so you can just wear hook it too a landyard or just stick it in your pocket.With the higher mp, I also don't have to worry anymore about zooming in or getting up close to my shot.  I can always photoshop later and get some excellent, clear photos.  I recently saw The Beach Boys in concert.  I was about 50 yards from the stage and I took about a hundred photos that night.

Gebauer", "ReviewID": "R116JL3WYMBDGP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking at replacing my Canon 300HS which was less than 1 1/2 years old with something that had more zoom and better video. Looking at travel zoom cameras the 4 main choices are the Sony HX20V, Canon SX260HS, Panasonic ZS20, and Nikon S9300. Due to the mediocre reviews of the Nikon by customers and camera review sites I immediately throw that one out. Looking at sample images in spite of having lesser megapixels the Canon seemed to produce the best images of the travel zoom cameras whereas the Sony was raved about for its video quality. The Panasonic seemed somewhere between the two.IMAGE QUALITY & CANON COMPARISON:The CCD in the Canon SX260HS is basically the same as the one in my 300HS. The SX260HS has a slightly newer processor than the 300HS. I felt pretty confident in what to expect image quality wise from the SX260HS. I was a bit nervous about purchasing the Sony because in spite of having the most megapixels it seemed to produce the worst images of the three cameras. I read many reviews where people used the words \"watercolor effect\" and \"artifacts\" when viewing an image from the HX20V at 100%. Looking at sample images it was clear to me that the CCD/lens from the Sony absolutely could produce quality images at 18MP. This 18MP chip is a new chip from Sony and I'm sure they were aware of the issue. Too often manufacturers use high MP's instead of actual image quality to sell cameras. Managing a camera shop for years I've been very aware of this.Seeing images from the HX20V another thing was clear to me. To compensate for the poor image quality, the processer in the Sony is sharpening the images way beyond what it should in order to try and give the poor resolution the effect of sharpness. This is actually creating a large amount of the artifacts in the images and heightens the watercolor effect. Before purchasing the camera I made sure it had a sharpness adjustment. I tested my theory with the camera by adjusting the sharpening in the camera. When you go from low to standard to high sharpening, you can see the artifacts and watercolor effect get worse and worse. This is even visible in camera when zooming in all the way to an image in playback. To be clear, no sharp resolution is gained by increasing the sharpness in camera, the lines actually look more jagged and the images look splotchier. I would advise anyone using this camera to turn the turn the sharpening to low when photographing. This option is available in the P and M modes.Because video quality was important to me I decided to go with the Sony HX20V. I have been very happy with my decision. Knowing that the Sony couldn't produce sharp images at 18MP, I did image test comparisons between the 12MP Canon 300HS and the Sony HX20V just to see how much sharp resolution the Sony could produce compared to the Canon. At 12MP the images from the Canon are starting to get soft. The HX20V at 100% as I stated earlier look very poor: \"watercolor effect\". Downsizing the resolution of the Sony's images to 12MP (4000x3000) they look on par to the Canon's. Some areas of the frame look better on the Sony while others better on the Canon. Because of this I really feel that Sony should have made the camera 12MP instead of 18MP. Increasing the resolution of the HX20V's images from 12MP does nothing but create larger files, no sharp resolution is actually gained. I wish there was a 12MP option in the HX20V. If there was I'd only shoot only in it. There is a 10MP option and from the shots I've taken there is only a minimal amount sharp resolution gained from shooting at 18MP vs 10MP. I'm primarily a DSLR shooter so for me a decent 12MP image is all I need from a P&S; so the Sony's image quality is good enough. I will mention that the colors from the Canon in the standard shooting mode looked better than those from the Sony which look muted in the standard shooting mode. From that standpoint I do feel that the Canon's images are better.VIDEO QUALITY & CANON COMPARISON:As I mentioned before video quality was important to me. The 1080p 60fps videos from the Sony look nothing short of spectacular. When comparing them to the 1080p 24fps videos from the Canon 300HS, which would be comparable to the Canon SX260HS 1080p videos at 24fps, it completely blows them away. The video resolution from the Sony HX20V looks crisper. Panning movements and action in the Sony's video look very smooth unlike the choppy look of the Canon because it captures videos at 24fps. Additionally, the video quality from the Sony in lower light blows away the Canon. My guess is that SX260HS performs better in low light than the 300HS but I'd be surprised if it was able to match the Sony. I've read some people complaining about the video quality from the Sony in low light when comparing the HX20V videos to camcorder videos in low light. This really isn't a fair comparison. It's like comparing the image quality to DSLR cameras. In P&S; cameras the video from Sony is as good as I've seen.STABILIZATION:The stabilization in the Sony is top notch. I've shot images zoomed in all the way, 500mm equivalent, indoors at 100 ISO and had usable images in the end which blew me away. The HX20V has a very snappy autofocus also. The focus speed is as quick as I've seen in a P&S.; It's extremely impressive for a travel zoom camera. The focus speed leaves the Panasonic ZS20, which I've played with, in the dust and is much faster than the Canon 300HS. The speed difference is most notable at the extreme telephoto. Switching focus on something from 70 feet away to 20 feet away at the extreme telephoto is as quick as a prosumer DSLR. To me the snappy focus speed outweighs whatever sharp resolution and color difference there is between the Sony and Canon or Panasonic. Neither resolution or color matter if the picture taken isn't what you wanted to take because the camera is so slow to respond.OPTICAL ZOOM:The 20x optical zoom is great to have. Having the zoom is a big improvement over the 5x optical zoom with the Canon 300HS. When you get to 15x-20x zoom with the Sony (the extreme telephoto of the lens) the image quality falls off even further. From what I've shot I'd say you only have sharp resolution equivalent to 7MP when shooting at 20x zoom. It is a far cry from the 18MP the camera shoots. It is something definitely to be aware of before purchase the camera. Image quality fall off is pretty typical of travel zoom P&S; and even travel zoom DSLR lenses but I was surprised at how far the image quality fell off with the HX20V.OTHER THOUGHTS:Besides the resolution my only other gripe with the camera is that it doesn't come with an external battery charger; you have to plug the camera in to a wall or computer to charge the removable battery in the camera. I found it a poor selling point that a camera like this forces you purchase an external battery charger; that you can't be out shooting and charging a battery at the same time. To make it worse the adapter cable for charging plugs in to the bottom of the camera. Overall, poorly thought through.SUMMARY:All and all the Sony was the best choice for me and didn't disappoint with its video quality. Again I feel that it should have made 12MP instead of 18MP. No sharp resolution quality is gained by it being 18MP. If image quality out of the camera is the #1 and only concern the Canon SX260HS may be a better choice. For a better balanced camera that has great stabilization, very fast autofocus, and amazing videos with a good amount of zoom, this is the one to get.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best Cybershot (small sensor) yet...", "Author": "Yogi Moore \"YogiM\"", "ReviewID": "R2223D162DKB25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must have owned nearly Cybershot so far, replaced the HX9 with the HX20V (didn't need the wifi in the 30v's...).

Yet. For now, this one's close enough for me.I shoot for the local paper and one thing this camera needed to do was to give me good enough shots in a lot of different conditions that would work for the paper. I like to have a camera with me at all times, but have gotten tired of carrying my full backpack everywhere.I am also a \"serious amatuer,\" in that I enjoy bringing back great photos of places I've been and things I've seen.So - check on both of those counts.The camera itself:It's small, but solid. I can fit it in a back pocket or jacket easily. Controls are straight forward enough that I haven't needed to consult a manual. After the first few uses, I did turn off the on screen guide, which got a little bothersome. And, overall, it's easy to find items on the menu.The photos:The real reason to buy a camera...I continue to be impressed with the photos I'm getting out of the Sony. I've shot inside, outside, action, etc. Just about every type of situation I would normally do with the Nikon.Picture quality is great. And the 20x zoom has been excellent to use in a few situations. The zoom isn't very fast (which is good) and it's not as precise as a manual zoom (no surprise), but that 20x optical is great to have. The \"Clear Image\" zoom seems to do just fine, though I haven't really pushed that one.The 10 frames/second mode is just that, and has been great to have ina couple of situations, like getting a full series of shots of a fire breather at a festival. One caveat, though, is the camera takes several seconds to process those 10 shots, rendering it useless for more shots until it's done. So plan ahead on when to push the shutter release.Surprises:All good, I assure you.I didnt' buy the Sony because of any of the various \"modes.\" The panoramic sweep mode sounded interesting, and I thought I might use that once or twice. Wrong. The panoramic sweep has been a great addition to how I shoot. I've used it to get great indoor shots that would have been too wide otherwise. And shots at a festival done with the panoramic sweep look great. I'm actually looking for reasons to shoot more panoramics.The other modes are also useful. I especially like the \"Toy\" mode, that gives a nice vignetting around the edges and richer colors.The \"Paint\" or HDR mode gives that cool HDR effect, but even on the light setting, I thought it was a little heavy handed. (Another caveat - the camera again takes several seconds to process any of the mode shots.)Tip:I have found the best results, and easiest way to control the camera settings, by setting it to \"P,\" which leaves the most menu options open with the touch of a few buttons. But if you leave the camera on one of the automatic settings, it works well, too.For the size, and for the 20x zoom, the Sony HX20V is exactly what I want with me now whenever I don't want to lug around 30-pounds of gear, but still want the great shots I'm used to.A gallery of shots done with the Sony (most with little or no post editing):[...]Check out more photos on Flickr to get a good indication of what this camera can do. Then buy one.Update:Just took both my DSLR and the Sony HX20V to a concert and shot with both. I'm actually happier with the shots from the Sony. Better, more consistent focus. Better exposure (I set it to P and center weight on the Auto Exposure). I put it in 10 fps mode and can pick out the best shot from each group.I'm happier and happier with this camera the more I use it.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY. READ ABOUT ZOOM:", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R2PU0W1025DPVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very impressed with this camera. The results I have seen so far on the computer are stunning. When previewing the images on windows photo view, the image is so large that you actually have to slightly zoom in to see and appreciate the sharpness of the lens. When I first downloaded and looked at sample images I wasnt seeing the sharpness of this lens. Then I realized that the file size was huge, and zoomed in just a little on windows image viewer. It made a world of difference, the sharpness instantly came forward. 18 mp is huge size for a compact point and shoot with a small sensor. But technology is improving. The watercolor mode is a lot of fun as well, and the video quality is the best Ive seen on a point and shoot. To be honest, Ive never really been a big fan of Sony cameras. Canon has and continues to produce some amazing point and shoots. There were two cameras I was looking at after more than a week of searching: The Canon sx260, and this Sony. I bought them both figuring id give them both a good three day test run. I was imressed with the canon, but not nearly as impressed as I was with this Sony. I found the sx260 to be overexposed, in many shots. I used the same setting on program mode, and manuel mode of the same framed shots on both a tripod, and handheld. The sky was often washed out and took on a white look with the canon, (something that can happen pariticulary more often with any point and shoot if your not careful)..but this camera it happened a lot less than any of the canons Ive used in the past...which is indicative that Sony is getting it more right when it comes to exposure.20x optical zoom: Theres something that Im not sure if a lot of people realize yet about the zoom on this camera. Its 20x zoom in the 18mp mode. But, if you turn the size of your image down to 10 megapixles, you are able to get 26x zoom range without distortion (it says this on sonys website even though I couldnt find this in the manuel).Regarding the zoom:  After having used the camera for a while now, I will say one thing about the zoom, (And in light of the nature of point and shoots, I dont see this as a con): On a mid day with plenty of sun at 20x, the camera can't capture the same hand held sharp image you would see at 15x or under. The reason I dont see this as a con because this is a compact digital camera. Your dealing with a smaller lens than what you would see on a digital SLR.  So because of that, the camera (and any other camera with this size with a 20x (560mm eqivilant zoom),  cannot let in as much light on the longer focal lengths. If you look at the front of any of these cameras, and zoom to 20x while looking at the lens, you will notice the that the iris of lens widens.  This is to allow more light in at your longer focal lengths.  Yet the reality remains for any of these compact point and shoots, the amount of light that they can let in in comparison to a digital SLR with a larger lens, is small in comparison.  But that said, this camera faired well, particularly on a sunny day whehre I could successfull zoom in and still maintiain good sharpness up to 15x.  After that, I would want a tripod. While I was initially tempted to state that 20x on any point and shoot is simply marketing, I cant say this because if you do have a tripod, you will still be able to capture some good shots at 20x. Basically, your covering 560mm on something which allows in much less light than any digital SLR lens.  Thats great under 15x. 20x is great too, and you will still be able to capture great images, you'll just want a tripod, because this isnt a $700.00+ lens (which is what you would pay for a digital SLR lens that can reach 560mm). I simply cant mark the camera down for this though, because having the option of being able to go 20x is nice, and image stabalization does work very well. But even with image stabalization, your lens itself simply cant let in as much light.  This goes for any of these +16x point and shoots.  If you really need zoom beyond 15x and want consistant results, consider one of the crossover cameras (the non SLR which have the same body as an SLR.  Those will get you better zoom, but to be honest its really hard to complain about something that fits in your pocket can be handheld, and take good pictures at 360mm eqivlant without a tripod.  A 300mm lens on any DSLR will cost you at least 300 dollars for brand name lenses like nikon or canon. So this is a great camera for zoom.Resolution: 18 mp.... You can print 16x20 sized pictures with something that fits in the palm of your hand. Its hard to complain about that especially when the photo results are quite impressive for a point and shoot camera.The colors: The colors are great in every shot I've taken. The CMOS senor really helps out a lot in terms of speed.In conclusion, I would rate this an excellent camera. I spent the last week going over camera after camera, review after review, picture sample after picture sample. In the end it came down to a choice between Sony's HX1, this Sony HX30v (or 20v without the gps), and canon's sx260. Every shot I took with the canon in the exact same environments turned out overexposed pictures in comparison to this Sony. This Sony was faster, did better with video, did just as well with color, and had an amazing screen. So it then came down to a choice between the Sony HX1 and this camera. The HX1 was in its day a 500+ dollar mega-zoom. It body looks quite similar to a DSLR. That camera has a sharp lens...but there are two principle things which made this Sony stand out. 1. SIZE of camera body. 2. PRINT SIZE... Having something that takes great photos with a 16 mp setting that allows you to zoom to 20x distortion free, and a 10mp setting which lets you have a 26x distortion free provides versatility. You can print a great 8x10 or 11x17 on a 10 mp setting. Ive done it, and the printed photo looked outstanding on my canon 9000 mark ii pro printer. My one last comment is to not judge the sample images for this camera by what opens in windows viewer. Its a large image file, so zooming in slightly will bring forward the sharpness of this lens, which is quite impressive.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best compact I've used (updated).", "Author": "e6bwhiz \"e6bwhiz\"", "ReviewID": "R275QSITG5EL9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the past 15 years I have only used compact cameras.

I've purchased and used models from Olympus, Canon, Samsung and Sony.  I have to say this camera takes the most impressive photos from a compact camera I've seen.  Maybe some of the most impressive of any camera.  The video is why I bought it and I am not disappointed.  Others have gone into details, but if you are interested in a compact camera that can do great video, I would have a hard time imagining something better.  I love the video.  Especially during outside daylight recording, it is like I'm looking into a window of reality.  The only thing I can see really improving on is the blurring effect when you pan the camera quickly.  It's not anything you wouldn't get in any other camera, but it is something that could be improved.  I record at the highest quality settings with all the stabilization activated.  Still, for what it is (compact camera), it is worthy of 5 stars.  My wife is using the Sony WX150 and it is not much different.  I would say if small size is paramount, get the WX150.  Otherwise get this camera.  This is only the second time I've ever given something 5 stars.  One footnote:  Be careful with it as it is delicate and I feel if any dirt gets in it or if it is handled without care, it may malfunction.*Update:  I had to send in the first one for a replacement.  The lens stopped retracting when turning it off sometimes.  The new one is working fine though.  Still love it.  Three other things I wish Sony would have different:  1.  I don't remove the photos off the card every day.  I wait a while and transfer to my computer every so often.  But when you go to delete the photos from the memory card there is no option to delete everything.  The best it has is to delete all photos on a single day.  Really annoying.  2.  The wrist strap doesn't have a movable clasp so you are unable to tighten it around your wrist.  Really makes the strap pointless.  I'm using an Olympus wrist strap I ordered online.  Sony, you don't want me advertising other brands?  Stop using stupid wrist straps.  3.  The highest quality video is saved with Sony AVC format.  Sony, why do you always have to be different?

(The Canon Powershot SX50 hs got the best reviews but at 19.4 oz, I just can't live with that big/heavy a camera.)Note:  I first tried the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19.  Although it has a lot of neat features, it didn't deliver on true color quality, especially indoors, moving or fairly still pets, or outdoors in my rose garden (which was surprising, since it did much better on closeups of the roses).  Also the exposure looks fine on the screen but when seen on viewer/computer, it's a bit too dark.  Then my sister, who happened to buy the same camera without my knowing started having problems with the zoom & the camera'd stop working.  Which after reading later reviews, happened to many people, so I do NOT recommend this camera.Then I tried a \"like-new\" Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX20V,  The colors indoors are much better than the Lumix, but the same outdoor garden rose's color still did NOT look true to life, rats!  Also the control dial especially & other parts of the camera seemed cheap/flimsy for an otherwise good camera.

Low light is still a bit of a problem (on all the cameras), but there's one fairly simple fix, \"Live\" option on the dial, where you can make adjustments for 3 things - light/vividness of color/cool vs warm color.  (The \"low light\" option on the SCN/Scene mode only is helpful in seriously low light.)  I do miss having a panoramic option, but I find I tend to do a movie in that case anyway.  The camera body is solid/well constructed.  You do have to use a button to pop up the flash when prompted, but it does save on battery life.  Overall, has the best pictures so far.

I had a older version of this camera and loved it too, but when video taping I could not zoom in or out, which was disappointing. This version is sleeker, zooms better and you can change the zoom while video taping.I have had big nicer cameras and videos in the past ,yes the expensive ones are much more capable than a small camera but who has the room to fit that in a purse or even juggling with all that bulky equipment. In real life you are on the go with your children and having both a camera and video in one light sleek camera is so much easier to carry around and access. For the size you really would be surprised on how well the zoom works and how beautiful the pictures are. You can also take pictures while video taping too. We went to Disney World and I just loved how easy it was to fit into a pocket or waist pouch, I didn't have to worry about where to store the camera when we were on rides. Not to mention the beautiful pictures and video it left for us.Go on youtube and watch some videos of this camera you will understand what I mean. Very strong camera. From experience when you are on the go, having a big camera and a video separately or even just a big camera, half of the time I opted not to take it because it was just to heavy and bulky to lug around resulting in using my phone camera which you know isn't that great.You will be surprised after you see the pictures and video's you get from this camera.

Although the smaller compact digital cameras are not as versatile as a good DSLR they nonetheless offer a lot of flexibility and convenience as well as pretty good quality images so long as you dont want to enlarge them to large.My HX20v at the time had the specs that I wanted and liked and the reviews were very favorable. I especially liked the longer lens (20x) over the 10x on my wife's 9v.It has GPs and movie features as wel as nine different modes such as Program, Manual, Intelligent auto, Scene selection, Background de-selection  etc. and different settings within the modes. It also has a built in flash. All of this is fairly standard for many digital compact cameras these days, It was just that I liked the features and capability of this make and model for what I wanted when I purchased it. Once you get used to the Menu and all of the settings, or at least the ones you intend to use most, the camera is fun to use.Although there are a variety of setting to use there is no Raw setting. It uses JPEG. For the purist and one who loves to use post image processing such as with Photoshop or lightroom, this is either an annoyance or is unacceptable. Since most digital compacts are like this, it is something you are aware of before purchasing the camera. Many professional phorographers have resigned themselves to this limitation and shifted to compact digitals like this, largely due to its convenience fully knowing that the post photo editing capability will have limitations.Overall this is a great little camera, that is small, light weight, convenient, easy to use and wil;l get the job done for most users. The price of this model is likely to be dropping further from around the $350 level since there are also the newer models of their 30v (w/ Wifi) and 50v (30x lens) available, but it is still a good little camera for the money.Movies can be a problem downloading in general however. Not for the camera however, but depending on the software used to download movies. Sony makes its own proprietary software (Play Memories) that can be downloaded to your computer from their site. PICASA (Google) software, which is superb for downloading individual photos, doesn't do movies. VLC software can work, but I find not anywhere near as well as the Sony software. The Sony software will download both movies and still photos but it is not as user friendly as Google's Picasa as it is difficult to find the file the photos and movies were downloaded to. If you have the free Picasa software also loaded onto your computer and have the seting properly set to scan all of your files, it will automatically pick up the photos you downloaded with your Sony Play Memories software and easily and automatically copy them into Picasa, where that file is easily recognozed.The movie feature works well. It takes good quality movie images. The length of the movies taken is only limited by the battery life on a full charge and the size of the memory card used.Overall this is a great little camera, that is small, light weight, convenient, easy to use and wil;l get the job done for most users. The price of this model is likely to be dropping further from around the $350 level since there are also the newer models of their 30v (w/ Wifi) and 50v (30x lens) available, but it is still a good little camera for the money.The camera has been very reliable and has taken some very good quality images.

I'm taking mine in to have it cleaned, after only 14 months (problem with dust spots started after 11 months).  I've read about others online having similar issues.Overall, absolutely love this camera... Great picture clarity and quality!!!  Excellent zoom.  Decent photos with flash.The downsides are:- not fast picture taking (each shot is digitally analyzed as the camera takes it, so they turn out beautifully, but that takes time away from ability to take pictures quickly)- after 1 year, spots appeared within the frame and on all my photos.  best guess from reading same issue others mention online is that these are specs of dust on the sensor.  tried cleaning lens, and tried \"vacuum trick\" which others say has worked for them (using a vacuum to suck the dust out), but didn't work for me!On the plus side, I'm so impressed with the quality of the photos and videos from this camera, that I'm going to buy another newer Sony model!  So, you can see that these \"downsides\" don't out-weigh my negatives for it.However, it is sad that Sony has the dust spots problem, as otherwise it's almost a perfect camera (particularly if it were a little faster it would be ideal).  I'm willing to trade the speed for better pictures, so that's why I'm looking at a new Sony.You can search for my review of a Panasonic camera, which I purchased and then returned for this camera.  I was so glad that I did - simply because the picture quality is far superior with the Sony.  Panasonic point-and-shoot cameras tend to last 2-3 years in my experience, but I was sad to see the life of this Sony was so short!I am a convert regarding their picture quality... for the price, it beats the others I've looked at.

I couldn't hope for a better picture, and it even includes image stabilization.My one complaint would be that us, being laymen to photography and not prone to reading through manuals, find that the settings easily get changed when the little knob on the top gets moved, and we tend to forget the one we had it on before.  So we find that when we are in the midst of some awesome or cute event and run for the camera, we have to spend time trying to find the setting it was on previously.  With all the different modes, we inevitably pick the wrong one the first few times and sometimes by the time we figure it out, the moment has passed.I realize that it is probably due, in part to our lack of detailed knowledge of the camera, but it has my wife and I more often than not reaching for our iPhone's to make sure we capture the image first, and then seeking out the camera and setting to get a better quality version, out of fear of missing the moment.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "S.

The video on the camera is surprisingly good and got me thinking more about video in general. That D7000 video is lacking in one area: fps. Since it could only go up to 30 fps it meant that when I wanted to slow something down I had to depend on software. I could have traded in the Nikon and bought a better DSLR for video but I wanted some flexibility. I thought a dedicated video camera might be the way to go. However, they were more than I had wanted to spend and since I didn't know how serious I would be with the video it didn't seem like a good idea.I zeroed in on this Sony because it was highly rated and had the 60fps. I bought it last September and it has worked out very well. I created a video for a friend's Indiegogo campaign, and this camera allowed for some really interesting effects; I used it to swoop over a map, with the 60 fps it made seem more sweeping. Very cool.I also discovered that pictures it took were also very good. It has a manual mode that other camera's in this category do not; took some moon shots with it. The panoramic mode is fantastic.  The size also was created because it allowed me to bring it a long to places I normally wouldn't have with my DSLR. It proved to be a great supplement to my D7000.So I had been using it pretty regularly up until a few months ago when the \"piece of dust\" showed up. Not sure how it got into the camera, but it was messing up all of my zoomed in pictures. I wasn't sure what too do about. I am a bit of tinkerer but the camera is sealed up pretty tight and didn't offer an easy way in. I never like the idea of sending something in for repairs (I feel they take to long), but I didn't know what else to do with this one. Luckily, this kind of thing is covered on the first year warranty. So I packed up and sent it off, not knowing how long it would take to get it back. I was amazed that it took less than two weeks.They cleaned out the dust and put in a new optic. Pictures look created and I am out taking video's again.Knowing that you their service is that good, I am much more likely to be getting more things from Sony in the future and have no problem recommending.

The only main issue and why I gave it 4* is that I don't understand the purpose of GPS.

I expected the location of the point of shot would be indicated on the picture (which is interesting feature to have and I saw on the camera of my friend). But that camera doesn't have that feature. Which is surprised me. The picture's metadata has the  physical coordinates of the picture taken but it didn't show the name and the country of the place where the picture was taken (or at least I couldn't find it in the manual or in the settings, which I doubt). I guess you need some special software to transfer physical coordinates of the picture to the name of the city, country but it doesn't make any sense for the amateur photographer and as I have mentioned I saw the old camera that indicates the location on the picture. But that feature isn't important for me. But we pay for something that doesn't make sense and battery life.

And I will say I am pleased with the video that comes back. But the color varies. I feel like this camera picks up a lot of shadow making many pictures have a more dark look, in comparison to my kodak which was never a problem. The camera is a little complicated with a lot of choices of how to shoot your photo best. The booklet that comes with it is only a general explanation. So not very good if you need a more in depth explanation. I tried to sign up for a digital camera class, but it got cancelled. So perhaps when I get a chance to take a class to better understand all my camera's gadgets, I might find this camera phenomenal. But a point and shoot digital camera, I do not find it is as easy as you would hope. You hook up the camera to your computer to download the Sony program so you can edit and store your photos. I have 2 different  (new) computers. The program would not work on either. So now I have to take out the memory card and place it in the computer to download the photos. I will be buying a separate photoshop program in the near future so I can edit the photos. Disappointed that the Sony program is not compatible with more computersWould I recommend this?

Build, speed, image quality, features are very good.  Multiple settings use HDR (combining multiple shots into one good one on-camera) - pretty cool, though many shots are overly-softened or smeared when viewed up close.  Outdoor shots much better than indoor in low light (High-Sensitivity/high ISO scene mode works well there though).  Indoor flash shots tend to blow-out up close subjects, though fixable in simple software.  Good high-def video, great long zoom, and the extended zoom (digital, not optical) is surprisingly good - hand held, and especially on a tripod.  Hey, it's a pocket camera with typical small image sensor, so considering that, it's a darn fine camera for the money.

As such I am pretty familiar with this series. Like everyone, me and my wife are totally frustrated at how slow the hx9v camera reacts.  You press the video record button and literally have to wait for several seconds before it shows the timer.  And if you change the menu wheel, another couple of seconds before it brings you to the shooting menu.This camera, the hx20v, took about 3 seconds from the time I pressed the on/off button to getting a picture.  That's much much faster than the hx9v.  And when I press the video record button, it immediately starts recording.  When I turn the mode dial to the SCN mode, it immediately showed me the menu.  Well, I still wish there was a way to turn off the 'Advanced shooting menu' and such notifications before it shows the actual menu, but hey, I'll take it.Also, on the hx9v, the digital zoom makes the picture very grainy and flubby, but on this camera, I took a picture at 40x zoom and even though it was not sharp, it was totally usable.  This was inside the store under bright light, but in darker conditions, you should turn off the digital zoom.overall, I am happy to see great progress in the hx series.

I think Sony wanted to have the fastest auto-focus time of any camera, but it seems to be they sacrificed accuracy for speed.I have adapted to this quirk by either snapping multiple shots, or when I have the time, doing several half-presses before shooting.  The auto-focus seems to work better the second or third time on the same shot.When the auto-focus does work correctly and the shot is in focus, it sure is beautiful.

It was near perfect.Unfortunately, in the past 3 months I have started to have issues, mainly the lens cover sticks, touching it will open it usually, but sometimes it stays partially closed in the lower right corner, which is tough to notice until you view photos on a larger screen. This problem makes it nearly impossible to trust the camera for quick shots since I never know if the lens will be completely uncovered when I turn the camera on.I have carefully cleaned this camera using every trick in my camera-cleaning arsenal (including, as a last resort, my mini-vacuum), but the lens cover still sticks.Secondarily, are the dust specs which have appeared in between the outer glass lens protector and the lens itself. They are visible at moderate-to-full zoom, particularly with landscape photos if the dust specs are located in the area where flat blue sky is pictured.Although I do take my camera into moderately rugged locations, I also am careful to keep it clean. I have a case that seals well against dust, and when we're riding motorcycles the camera is inside the case. When we're hiking, the camera is around my neck, but if we get into situations where it might get knocked around, I put it inside the case in by backpack. I don't just use a camera just at home, but I also am not dragging it out to the Bonneville Salt Flats or photographing sandstorms in the desert.I have other cameras which have not had these issues, although I did need to disassemble my Panasonic DMC-ZS3 after a couple of years of use and clean the sensor. Fortunately, they make that camera very easy to access the internal components, so it was an easy job. Not so much for this DSC-HX20V.

The zoom feature is really fantastic - it's really great for taking photos of birds, animals, flowers, and of course distant objects.

If you haven't owned one previously, it doesn't take too long to figure out how to delete photos, view photos, etc.My only real complaints are the time it takes for the zoom to come into focus and the location of the USB port being on the bottom of the camera, which doesn't allow you to set the camera \"upright\" when sitting it on a desk/table for purposes of offloading your photos onto a computer, for example. While the zoom feature is great, if you are trying to snap a photo of a bird or animal, there's a good chance it will get away before the zoom comes into focus enough to snap the photo.

Before I got this I had a cheap digital camera and a $300 HD Camcorder. I wanted to find a camera that would do both take good pictures and shoot good HD video as well as be portable. This is exactly what I was looking for.Pictures - The pictures look great on this camera. The only downfall is that you can't shoot pictures in the RAW format (just jpeg). There are lots of options you can use under manual to make the pictures look great. I personally like the \"toy\" (makes pictures look more artsy) and \"pop\" (really brings out the colors in your pictures). With in those options you  can pick which color hue you want as well. I havent had any issues taking pictures with this camera at all.3D pictures - the 3d pictures are nice. I downloaded a free software that will convert the 3d images on my sd card into a format where i can see them with the red and cyan glasses. The \"sweep multi angle\" is the best option for shooting 3d pictures. I will take multiple pictures of the same image because it can be blurry.Video - The video on this camera is full HD. What is great is you can shoot in acvhd which I have a hard time editing with (a problem I had with my camcorder) or you can shoot with the mp4 format. I havent had any issues editing with the mp4's so I love that this camera lets me pick between two different formats. You can also pick whether you want to shoot in 1080, 720, or VGA. The bad part about the video function is you dont have a lot of control over how you want shots to look. There is no white balance in video mode. You can adjust the brightness but you cant adjust contrast or saturation. One nice thing about this camera though is that you can use some of the manual picture modes and record video with those features. For instance if I am outside and I am in video mode and the grass and trees just don't look as green as they should I can switch over to manaul mode for pictures and set \"toy\" or \"pop\" and then hit record and the colors will look a lot better. The negative side of that is that you can't adjust brightness when you do that.Also, the video is decent with landscape shots outside. I found my camcorder does a better job with that. But with the sensor on this camera the inside shots look so much better than the camcorder. My shots with this are never grainy indoors. And close-ups both in and out doors look fantastic with this. I was blown away by how much it out preformed my camcorder and basically everything except the landscape shots.Space - I use a 32gb card. I can take a lot of videos and pictures before this the card gets full. The mp4 files are highly compressed so they dont take up much space video wise but still look great. And since the pictures are just jpegs they dont take up that much space either. When I first got this i was taking lots of pictures and videos, it took a couple of days of doing that before the card got full. So this is great for people taking trips who want to take lots of pictures and videos.Battery - I love the battery life on this. My camcorder would last like 20 to 30 minutes. This Sony camera will last like 40 minutes to an hour, depending on what I am doing. If i am doing just video it is more like 40 minutes or so, if I am taking pictures it will last a long time. If I am doing both equally then it will be around an hour. I bought some cheap backup batteries on here so I never have an issue of running out of batteries.Overall I would recommend this camera if you are looking for portable camera that can shoot great pictures and HD video. It is by no means a DSLR quality camera but that is why it is a lot cheaper than one.

I know it's standard nowadays, but it comes in handy, and the SD expansion slot means that I'm not feeling limited on how much video I can take on the average day.

Flash always in the way.  You are not supposed to push it back in, but it happens a lot by mistake...3.  Every time you change a mode with the dial, particularly the SCN mode, all the different option icons come up on the screen every time, so it takes a few seconds to select and set the options you want ...Since I do this quite frequently, it becomes a slow down problem for me.  It should be set by default to the last setting i had chosen and only if I need to change it then I would bring up all the options on the screen, like Canon does with its Function button.  I use HDR only on high contrast situations, so I keep switching back and forth from HDR mode to P, and every time it's several seconds between shots.

I tried looking at the on-camera manual but it doesn't really help.That sweeping 3D feature thing? I hate that. So much. I thought it would take a moveable 3D image of a scene... that's what it's supposed to do, right? But when I use it, it just makes a choppy... heck, I'll call it a flip-book. It's like you see the whole image at once and only certain parts move. It looks stupid. Maybe I'm an idiot.Also I'm a bit peeved that the HDMI port on it to let you see your 3D pics on the TV, is a mini-HDMI port. So I had to order a new cord. We'll see how that goes.As for the main function (take great pictures) works sexily, the bells and whistles are making me sad. Oh, well.

It is very fast in taking photos. The colors turn out very vibrant and alive! In fact many times I take a photo of something and it looks better on the little screen than in real life. The camera has 18 megapixels, which is probably enough to make movie posters. I dont think it needs so many pixels but maybe that contributes to the fine quality of its pictures. Im impressed with the battery life. Even when the camera sits around for long periods, Its noticeable that the battery does not drain. The menu is the modern standard with various scene modes. It is actually one of the better menu systems for a point and shoot. Easy to navigate. The buttons feel a little flimsy but they are still very responsive and accurate. I do not like the flash on this camera. It pops out in the exact spot where its comfortable to hold it. But its not enough of a complaint considering how well everything works. I tried the movie mode and was actually impressed with the video and sound quality. I didnt really test the aperture, s/p and other settings because I think these point and shoots are only good for Auto mode.

I am putting up a photo of it...anyone else have this problem or am I just unlucky?####I like this camera, a lot. So this is more a rant about the current state of \"featuritis\" and lack of printed manuals.Considering that I wrote a BOOK on using digital cameras*, teach about them, and am considered an \"expert\" in some media circles, this is just nuts.  I actually had to spend quite a bit of time figuring out which mode (intelligent auto, really even more intelligent auto, program auto or easy auto) was the right mode to locate a menu of special artistic effects.  Darn you, Sony!Why not read the manual, you say?  THERE IS NO MANUAL!  Not in print, not on disk!  Just a puny getting started booklet, half of which is in Spanish. [Comments indicate there is a manual available online, but I deal with a lot of people who either are technically challenged or simply don't have time or patience to deal with such things.  Sometimes I get the feeling that digital camera manufacturers sometimes forget what I call the \"prime directive:\" remember your audience. They seem to make cameras to impress each other and forget that their customer -and not an enthusiast- is nowhere near as excited about all the bells and whistles as they are.]All of the \"help\" is in the camera as a series of on-screen guides. So if I locate the \"key word\" for a certain feature, (high dynamic range black and white, for example) it can take me to it, but does not do a good job of helping me find it on my own!  Most of the special effects were found in the program auto mode, which in retrospect makes a certain amount of sense. Generally the program or \"P\" mode offers full auto operation with significant overrides. But that's a lot of 2020 hindsight preceded by a lot of head scratching.Any camera that has \"Intelligent Auto\" and then \"Super Intelligent Auto\" and then \"Easy Mode\" that hides all the cool new stuff is trying too hard to be all things to all people. \u2028But if you take the time to learn to use the camera, you will find it quite enjoyable. There are significant post-processing effects that may allow you to take pictures you were unable to successfully take before, and many of them are done behind the scenes so you don't have to worry how it happened.If you are one of these folks who only wants to sometime set the ISO and check to make sure the resolution is correct, this camera will cause brain freeze.But if you only lock it into \"easy\" mode, you are spending a lot of money for technology you may never even find.I did get some excellent video results of an important local event, and was able to strip off the audio (stereo!) and use it in a radio report.This is also a somewhat delicate camera, as in a 20X zoom in a fragile extending lens system. So buy a good case and read up on all the places you should not use it. It ain't no rugged 35mm point and shoot, but then again, most digital cameras aren't either.*\"How To Use The Digital Camera You Just Bought\" is SOLD OUT!

I ended up buying a Lowepro (not a brand I considered when first shopping online) Newport 10. Its made of some kind of tough nylon-type fabric and has some internal stiffening in the face of the case to protect the camera. It has one zipper across the top to access the camera compartment and a small zipper into a accessory slip-pocket on the front that can hold a battery and memory card. The camera fits just right - not too tight nor too loose. And it has a sewn-in belt loop that won't be easily removed by a thief.COMPLAINT - My only MAJOR complaint thus far it that SONY DOES NOT IN ANY REASONABLE WAY PROVIDE A DETAILED USER'S MANUAL FOR THIS PRETTY COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE CAMERA!!!HERE IS WHAT SONY PROVIDES:1.  A \"Digital Still Camera Instruction Manual\" is in the box with the camera and can be downloaded at sony.com as a PDF file. But, after subtracting Spanish language pages, blank pages, front and back covers and other pages having nothing to do with how to use this camera (including notes to users in Norway) THERE ARE ONLY 24 PAGES ADDRESSING ACTUAL USE OF THIS CAMERA - AND THAT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE!!2.  At Sony's website there are two aditional documents. One is called a \"2012 Cyber-shot\u00ae Digital Still Cameras Product Guide.\" It's appears to be a sales brochure!3.  The second additional document available at Sony's website is a \"Cyber-Shot User's Guide\". This ia a lengthy document that goes into some detail about using the camera. But, Sony only provides this as an html file which can't be downloaded (or at least not easily downloaded)! You can only view this manual online or print each section one at a time (and many sections are but a single page long). I've already spent about 8 hours printing this manual and am perhaps half done!!DPREVIEW indicates that in this regard, Sony has reached a new low among camera manufacturers. I agree completely. I had a run-in with Sony some years ago over a CD player warranty and they screwed me!! Well, they've now screwed me twice!!

If you are a professional photographer I can save you a lot of time, the choice is simple, do you want to shoot video or do you plan to use this camera as a backup?If you are a still photographer this HX20V model is by far the worse possible choice, stay away from this model and take a look at the Sony NEX series instead. The high-end NEX is the best camera in the market right now, in some way better than Canon and Nikon DSLRs . However, if you are looking for a pocket camera with a super telephoto (20x) to shoot 1080p VIDEO then you will love it. This camera has the best video stabilizer in the industry. Specially recommended for videotaping action and sports.Sadly, all stills taken with this camera suffer from a STRONG watercolor effect (I call it a defect for obvious reasons), pictures look like paintings made out of color blotches, specially if taken at full telephoto,  there is no \"mode\" to cancel out this awful effect and it is not to be confused with the included \"watercolor\" mode. It gets much worse if you use the Night TIme modes. It is quite apparent even at 100% and there is no way to get rid of it in Photoshop. This watercolor effect is how Sony decided to hide the noise from the tiny sensor. For that reason, I do not recommend this camera for serious photographers.The good news is: the battery life is far above all other cameras in this class. The focusing speed is also far above any camera including the most professional DSLRs (one of the advantages of having a tiny lens)Update: I mentioned this camera takes excellent HD video because the stabilizer works perfectly even at 20x zoom, this is still true but only in bright daylight. It is best to use another camera to shoot video in darker environments, i.e. churches, indoor concerts or any other indoor or night-time activity. Surprisingly the HX20V is not sensitive enough to record video in low light at all.Another annoying aspect of this camera is that it takes too long to save each photo to the memory card so you tend to loose a lot of great opportunities.

The missing star is for the placement of the flash, very annoying to me, I find it somewhat awkward to hold so that I am not pressing on the flash, great camera otherwise.This little camera will fit in your pocket and has a nice telephoto lens. So easy to travel with and take true to color photos, takes wonderful photos in a darkened room. I took pictures of my cat and she was in a darker area of the room and normally the picture would have turned out dark but this camera automatically lightened the picture just right so that I could see her face clearly.One problem I am having since I don't have an extra SD card right now I was just using the cameras memory to take pictures and apparently you can't transfer the pictures to the computer if it doesn't have a SD card in it, I am told that there are no pictures or movies available? I can see the pictures on the camera but I can't get them transferred? Maybe I am doing something wrong but so far I haven't figured it out. I will have to get a SD card and then update this as to how it works then.The flash is annoying, it is right where I place my finger to stabilize the camera so I have to remember to hold it differently so that the flash is able to emerge from the camera when it is needed. The zoom feature optical and digital are great, you can zero in on almost anything. I love the Auto setting it manages the picture for you and makes really great pictures, they are clear high definition.The manual that comes with it really doesn't tell you much about the different setting and controls, sure would have been nice to have some explanations on these features.I wish it would have come with a sd card since the pictures can't be easily transferred unless you have a sd card in the camera, I just don't have an extra one right now so that is something I will have to get to finish testing it.The battery does charge pretty quickly using the USB charger)it works by plugging in the camera USB itself, it is not a separate charger but that is OK, I don't have to remove the battery from the camera to charge it)The LCD screen is very sharp and clear but outside in the bright sunlight it is difficult to see but most LCD screens are difficult to see in sunlight.I will post back after I try out with a sd card.If someone knows how to transfer the photos from the camera memory to the computer let me know, I have win7 and windows and the program that comes with the camera can't find any pictures?BTW the install of the program is very easy and seems to work fine on win7, it is included on the camera and will semi auto install once you plug the camera into the computer.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony HX20V..", "Author": "Christopher Binns", "ReviewID": "R2PXBLBMH03WGT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent,near-instantaneous, reliable auto-focusing, rock solid image stability, especially during video, virtually instantaneous start-up, sublime ergonomics, a killer 20X zoom and an absolutely stunning as-good-as-any-camcorder 1080p/60fps video, marred by sub-standard picture quality. I can't recommend this camera without listing the caveats. An aggressive, un-defeatable noise reduction incentive has been added, perhaps to offset the inherent and unavoidable noise that results from too many pixels crammed onto a tiny sensor. Photos are reasonably sharp but upon normal view but they're definitely not recommended to for pixel-peepers. The defocus effect is sensational, as is the HDR.
