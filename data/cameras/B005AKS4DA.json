Lauroel", "ReviewID": "R1UE6LG16SCM28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the reviews for the different colors of this camera model, so got a better overview of people's opinions that way. As long as it's the same model number, the color doesn't matter, and there are more reviews posted for some of the other colors of this camera.It doesn't matter whether you are budgeting because you have to or because you want to save money for your future or for some other reason, this camera will definitely fit a budget better than most of the digital cameras out there. One reviewer stated that those who gave good reviews of this camera have probably not owned a nice camera previously. Well, I do fit into that category of not having owned an expensive camera before, but regardless, I love this camera. I have had a barrel of fun wih it. It is easy to use for someone such as myself who does not know a lot about photo-taking. To me, it takes great pictures, with great color, and I could not be happier with it. I got a 2 GB Sandisk memory card (from Amazon) and a Transcend card reader (very inexpensive from Amazon--$8.54 including shipping compared to $35 or $40 for others--and works great for my MSNTV internet device, about which I was very concerned about finding any compatible card reader anywhere at any price). So at this point I am a very happy buyer. Amazon rocks!!  I have been really happy with photos of sunsets, my bottle trees, crafts projects, trees, myself (taken by myself just holding my arm out and snapping a photo at arm's length), paintings I've done, and more. I have not tried the video mode yet so can't comment on that. One note--this camera will hold only one photo in its internal memory. You pretty much have to purchase a memory card. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take photos that don't require professional results. Again, I love it.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Easyshare!", "Author": "melissa", "ReviewID": "RG8C0K03LW0QT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As of March 15, 2013 Kodak stopped allowing downloads of Easyshare.

Kodak no longer provides or supports software - the notice in the description is flat-out false.3. As for the \"sharing destinations\" advertised: nope. Most are not available. You can't share to Flickr, YouTube, Twitter and more.I've only just received the camera and can't really do anything with it since I have to get the SD card to make it work.

It takes good enough pictures for my father in law, but he has to take the camera to a place that prints the pictures for him.  After the first packet of printer paper, the printer jammed.

It must have had better optics that more than compensated for the increased pixels.  The C1505 camera's lens does not move in and out to focus, so it must all be internally done and perhaps by software.The price for the 2 cameras is similar so I would think the quality of pictures would be similar.Functionality the cameras offer similar options.  The C1505 is not as friendly getting to the options.  Most settings are displayed on the back screen as opposed to external dial type settings.  So in bright sunlight it is hard to see how the camera is set up for pictures.  Recently I thought I had the video function working while outside in the sun, but was disappointed to find out that it was not turned on.  I missed capturing 2 black hawk helicopters landing in celebration of memorial day events.I would not purchase this camera again.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "piece of junk!", "Author": "tmrosla", "ReviewID": "R231PMYFPTARB8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I read the reviews for this and they were so varied that I wasn't quite sure which to believe. I should have believed the bad reviews on this one! (Actually, I should have gone to a store first and tested it out) I figure that the people that wrote the good reviews have never had a nice camera before. After losing my Sony CyberShot, this one seems like a child's toy. Which it will be, I am giving it to my 4-year-old to play with and buying a Nikon. I have had a Kodak Easyshare in the past, and I loved it. They are easy to use, I will give them that. That old 4.1 MP that I had took way better pictures than this piece of s***, I actually won a photography contest and people asked me what camera I used to take the picture. They couldn't believe it! Now I have to struggle to get a decent picture with this thing that I thought would be an upgrade. How wrong I was!
