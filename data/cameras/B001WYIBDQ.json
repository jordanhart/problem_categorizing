Really sharp images, etc.  One thing I hate is that you have to switch to another setting to see the pictures you just took.  There's not an instant playback feature.Yesterday, it died.  The CCD screen went black never to return.  I am hoping it is still under warranty.", "Date": "December 19, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "GE Digital Camera 12MP, 3X Optical Zoom, 2.5\"LCD w\nPoint-and-shoot-digital-cameras\nGE Digital Camera 12MP BLACK", "Name": "Ge Digital Camera 12MP Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410nZeVq5eL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001WYIBDQ"}}
