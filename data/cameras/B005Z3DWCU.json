{"Reviews": [{"Title": "PERFECT!", "Author": "Cinnamon", "ReviewID": "R1VRLBMZAAZTBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whether you're new to the world of DSLRs, or are a seasoned photographer who wants to try your luck at video, the Canon Rebel T2i is perfect. I've had nothing but great experiences with it so far, and highly recommend to everyone.Other than the T2i, I own (and primarily shoot with) the Rebel XS (1000D), and also have extensive experience with the Canon 50D. While my XS still serves me very well, I wanted to get an SLR with video capabilities since the release of the T1i. After finally saving up enough for the T1i, I really lucked out that Canon announced the T2i, which has even better features! I am lucky enough to finally have it, and want to share my experiences, and how they compare to my expectations==================OVERALL IMPRESSIONSThe camera is very small and light. It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't \"feel cheap\" in my opinion. It features a 3-inch LCD (compared to the Rebel XS's 2.5 inch screen), which also has a very high resolution. It looks lovely! Auto-focus is fast, and I've been very pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos I've taken so far.==================PROSIMAGE QUALITY: I feared that cramming so many megapixels onto this sensor, there would be a lot of image 'noise' (the megapixel myth). This thankfully hasn't been an issue, and I've been very pleased with the pictures taken with this camera! Aside from White Balance issues (see below, Cons), image quality is pretty good!VIDEO: Some people have disparagingly said that Video on DSLRs is just a gimmick. I disagree. Based on sample clips I'd seen on YouTube, I was excited about getting an HDSLR, and while videos are sometimes shaky if you don't have very steady hands, a tripod eliminates those concerns. Audio quality on the T1i was criticized by many, but the T2i has a microphone input jack, which allows you to connect a mic. I don't yet own one so can't comment on that feature, but will update this review if and when I save enough to try this feature out. Additionally, this offers improved recording options, including higher fps (frames per second) than the T1i, which technically offered \"true HD\" recording of 1080, but only at a choppy 20 fps.LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE: I am much more impressed than I expected. My Rebel XS could go up to ISO 1600, but would perform pretty poorly there. This not only can go up to a significantly higher ISO level, but performs much better. Less image noise means you have to waste less time editing your pics, and many more keepers!SDXC SUPPORT: Only own SDHC cards up until now, but it's great to know that this supports the next generation of flash storage, which means you'll in the future be able to hold many more pictures than currently available.CONSNOT A FULL-FRAME SLR: This is not a full-frame SLR like the Canon 5D Mark II, and the APS-C sized sensor results in a crop factor (1.6x), and doesn't necessarily provide the same image quality as the larger, full-frame sensor does. Still, at less than half the cost of the Mark II, I think this is a trade-off that's well worth it for most users.Crop factor means that this camera, like other Canon DSLRs that have the APS-C size image sensor, will not be true to the lens's designation. A 50mm lens will produce an image more in line with 50mm x 1.6, or 80mm on a full-frame. This not only makes a difference for those who want to do landscape photography (which usually benefits from wide-angle views), but for those with unsteady hands. The general logic is that to ensure a steady shot, you need to shoot at the reciprocal of your focal length. So for a 50mm focal length, you should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/50 second for a steady shot. Keeping the crop factor in mind, you really should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/80 a second.Crop factors are common for most digital SLRs, as full-frame sensors jack up the cost of production, which are then passed on to the consumer in the form of very expensive cameras. So it's not so much a shortcoming of the Rebel T2i, but just a note to keep in the back of your mind.DIFFERENT BATTERY: This is more of a hassle for those who owned spare batteries than for those whose first SLR would be the T2i, but Canon changed the battery. Again, not such a big deal, but might be a hassle for some who find out that their old batteries can't be used on this model.WHITE BALANCE: I found that the 'Auto' White-Balance setting was wildly inaccurate on my Rebel XS (often giving indoor shots a yellow tint unless I changed the WB to the 'Incandescent Light' mode), and I feel that the WB settings on this model still aren't as accurate as they should be. If you want truly accurate WB, you can use a gray card, or an alternative would be to simply try digitally editing the photos on your computer after shooting.NO ARTICULATING SCREEN: No articulating screen, but this is a rare feature in DSLR's in general, so it's not a shortcoming of the T2i. Since most of your shots will probably be composed using the viewfinder, not a big deal, although it would have been convenient! If you absolutely must have an articulating screen on an HDSLR, look into the Nikon D5000.===================A NOTE ABOUT THE KIT LENSThe lens that comes with this is the standard 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 that comes with the other Rebels. It's a very good all-around lens, but you more likely than not will want to at some point upgrade your lens for either (a) better image quality, or (b) better performance in low-light conditions.This lens is very good, but for pros or those who pay incredibly close attention to detail, the optical quality of Canon's higher-end lenses is superior than to the kit lens. For most users, I don't think image quality will be a huge issue.More likely, the aperture size will be the reason people want to upgrade their lens over time.  A lens with a wider aperture allows more light to reach the sensor in less time than a lens with a narrower aperture. That means you can employ a faster shutter speed, which allows you to snap the shot faster, reducing the likelihood of a blurry picture. Outdoors on a sunny day, this aperture range of this lens won't be a limiting factor; inside a poorly-lit gym, however, you'll notice some blurry shots (see below for a recommended alternative for low-light shooting).Still, this is a pretty good all-around lens that can result in some great shots!===================RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES1. An external flash: This will come in very handy. With the built-in flash, your photos often come out harshly lit. Bouncing an external flash off the wall makes a huge difference in image quality. I personally use the Speedlite 580EX II, but there are cheaper alternatives that are very good. Some higher-end cameras (i.e. Canon 5D Mark II) don't even have a built-in flash, which goes to show something about how high-level photographers view the lighting provided by internal flashes.2. 50mm f/1.8 II lens - At around one hundred dollars, this lens is relatively cheap when compared to others on the market. Despite its low price, it offers great image quality. While it lacks IS (image stabilization) like some other Canon lenses (including the kit lens), with a wide aperture of f/1.8, enough light usually comes in to ensure a fast shutter speed, which in turn minimizes camera shake. Keep in mind that as a 'prime' lens, your feet will have to do the zooming in and out. This is not as convenient as an everyday walk-around lens like the 18-55 kit lens which gives a good zoom range, but is a great lens for portraits. Also would ideally be a good option for poorly-lit places where the aperture of the kit-lens isn't wide enough to ensure a steady shot.CONCLUSIONSFrom my list of 4 pros and 4 cons, you might wonder why I'm giving this product 5 stars?... It's because considering the great performance - and low price - of the T2i, the 'cons' I list really aren't that big of a deal. Just because some cameras offer the aforementioned features the T2i lacks, it doesn't mean the T2i isn't a solid performer.  On the contrary, I have been completely satisfied with this camera's image and video quality, performance, features, AND PRICE, and would recommend the T2i to anyone looking for an affordable way to capture memories!------------------EDIT 11/27/10I just wanted to update this review to say that after shooting with the T2i for nearly half a year, I'm still as impressed by this camera as when I first got it. I have a few comments to expand on my initial review:VIDEO  I have been using the video mode a lot more than I initially expected. While it doesn't offer continuous auto-focus and therefore might not replace a camcorder, once you get the hang of manually focusing this is not a big problem. I many times have found myself in situations where photos couldn't capture the moment as well as a video could, and the ability to record clips has been very convenient.A note on the video mode, however...while it's automatic exposure is fine for most situations, if you find your videos are grainy, it's best to manually control the exposure. I've seen that sometimes even in good lighting, the camera will keep the aperture small (to have a less shallow depth of field) and boost the ISO. You can get around that by manually adjusting exposure settings, but again, the automatic exposures are usually fine.As for audio with videos, I personally still have not purchased an external microphone, but for those who are serious about movie production Amazon sells a highly popular 'Rode VideoMic' for a reasonable price. I have looked up videos on YouTube which demonstrate the difference between the built-in mic and an external mic, and while it's  tempting, I'd rather spend my money on better lenses than audio accessories.CROP FACTOR  To clarify on my 'crop factor' point from above on a full-frame vs. a crop-sensor body, there is a useful video on Vimeo that illustrates what I'm talking about. If you Google '5D 7D crop factor Vimeo' it comes up as the first result. As you can see, a full frame camera offers a view truer to the lens designations. Again, full frame cameras are costlier to make and therefore more expensive to the consumer, so APS-C sensor cameras like the Rebel T2i, 60D, and 7D are very good values for the money. But if you are not on a tight budget and think you might one day want to upgrade to a full frame some day for the improved low-light performance, higher image quality, and wider field of view, maybe skip on a T2i and just aim for a 5D Mark II (I personally love my T2i, but am excited about some day having my 24-105 shoot wider than its current effective 38-168 range.). For most users, however, APS-C sensor cameras like the T2i should be great, and some might even find the crop factor useful for telephoto work.LENSES  After spending so much money on a camera body, many people have a difficult time justifying buying expensive lenses, and I understand that. After upgrading from the 18-55mm kit lens to the 24-105L lens, however, I can honestly say that the money is well worth it. Colors are more vivid and truer to real life than the [now noticeably] duller colors produced by the non-L lens, and I rarely use the kit lens now. Again, the 18-55 is very versatile and provides a great value, but if you can afford to upgrade your lens to Canon's L series, you won't regret it. Perhaps try before you buy, to see for yourself what I'm talking about.LOW LIGHT  While this camera offers a boost ISO mode (to 12800 from 6400), I don't use that since its results are too grainy for my liking. But for night shots without a tripod, I have found ISO 3200 and 6400 to be a real advantage over my previous Rebel XS which only went up to ISO 1600, and even then produced noisier images than the T2i at 1600. While this camera doesn't produce high ISO pictures as cleanly as a full frame 5DMk2 does, at a fraction of the price I am incredibly pleased with this camera.MEMORY CARD  Lastly, I wanted to recommend you do a lot of research into which SD card you want to use. Class 6 or higher is recommended, but look into reviews to see how the card actually performs. I used to use a Transcend Class 6 card since it's very affordable, and have had movies abruptly stop recording at inopportune times. I upgraded to a Transcend Class 10, and unfortunately continue to have that happen. Not all Class 10 cards necessarily write at the same speed, so look thoroughly into reviews if you plan on using video mode to ensure you get a reliable, high-speed card. The Transcend cards are a great value for the money, and have many times been fine, but you might want to consider more expensive alternatives for greater reliability.------------------EDIT 01/28/11I wanted to update this review to reflect the fact that the camera is still serving me well, and to recommend some additional accessories I have since paired my T2i with. I recently got the Induro AKB0 Tripod Kit (Black), Joby GP8-BHEN Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead X bundle, Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod, and Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, and highly recommend them.CAMERA SUPPORT  With the T2i you can pull off handheld shots in low light by cranking up the ISO, but even though the T2i shows relatively little noise, it does show more than some would like in their shots (especially at ISO 6400). Digital noise can be reduced in post-production, but it's much easier to shoot at a lower ISO in the first place, especially for night shots. After paying so much for a camera body and other accessories, buying an expensive tripod might be the last thing you'd want to do, and I understand that: for a while I was using an older, cheaper tripod that was designed more for light camcorders than SLRs with heavy lenses. While this set-up technically worked, I didn't feel very confident in its reliability. After doing a lot of research and asking many photographers, I got the Induro kit, and have been very happy with it so far. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but it doesn't make sense to skimp on support and risk damaging your gear! With tripods, you have to make trade-offs between price, sturdiness, and weight, and while I'm happy with my tripod, it might not be adequate for your needs. There are many websites with tips on what to look for in a tripod (i.e. ball head, pan-tilt head, etc) that can help you make an informed decision. The Gorillapod is not nearly as essential to your shooting as a dedicated tripod, but I recommend it if you find yourself in situations where you don't want to/might not be permitted to carry a tripod, but need support. It sets up much faster than a tripod which needs to have its legs extended and locked. Lastly, a monopod is a great way to stabilize your shots without the hassle of having to carry a tripod, and is even more portable than a Gorillapod. That being said, it doesn't provide as much stability, so I use it primarily to stabilize video shooting (which can be a bit shaky due to composition through LCD screen instead of viewfinder, especially with a telephoto lens).TELEPHOTO LENS  The T2i has a high resolution sensor that, in my experience, provides for great shots even after cropping. I have taken shots and cropped to 100% and been pleased with results, but sometimes you want extended reach without cropping, and here a good telephoto really shines. Canon and third-party lens manufacturers offer many great telephoto options for the T2i, and it's important to think of what you need a telephoto lens for before investing in one. If you'll primarily be shooting with a tripod, you probably don't need IS; if you're going to be shooting in adequate light, a wide aperture isn't essential. I used the Canon 70-300 non-L non-IS lens, but don't recommend it. Keeping in mind the reciprocity of focal length and shutter speed, Image Stabilization on a telephoto lens makes things much easier for hand-held shooting. I much preferred the 55-250 IS over my 70-300 non-IS (there are also IS versions of the 70-300), but found its low-light performance was weak due to its relatively small maximum aperture size. I recently got the 70-200 2.8 IS II, and am blown away by its fast auto-focus, great low-light performance, and superior optical quality. It is an expensive lens, but is well worth it if you need a fast lens (wide aperture) that features Image Stabilization.--------------------------EDIT 02/07/11 *FINAL UPDATE*NEW REBEL  The T2i's successor, the T3i has just been announced, and will be available in March. Based on its specs, I don't think this is a necessary upgrade for current T2i owners. The main improvements found in the T3i are a swiveling screen, wireless flash transmitter, improved Auto mode detection, an enhanced Movie Zoom mode, and creative filters. Of these, I think the most important or sought-after improvements are the flash transmitter (which is is great for advanced shooters and those who want to explore with lighting) and the swiveling LCD screen (which allows for more flexibility in shooting). While these are useful new features, they are largely incremental and I will be sticking with my T2i. For new buyers, the T3i looks great and is very worth looking into when it comes out. Canon also announced a T3 camera to succeed the Rebel XS, which is great for beginners but is lacking in features compared to the T2i and the newly-announced T3i, including the ability to capture 'true HD' at 1080. Even with Canon's recent announcements, I think the T2i is a great DSLR and I highly recommend it to everyone.----------------------------EDIT 06/13/11 *THIS REALLY IS THE FINAL UPDATE*I know this review is now longer than some novels, but I really can't stress enough how great this camera is. I've used this in a variety of settings, both professionally and for personal use, and it's served me so well throughout. While I've shot events before, last night I shot the Tony Awards in NYC...which meant many thousands of shots over the course of many hours...and I was highly impressed with the T2i's performance. I did have to change batteries during the course of the event, but that was many hours into the event. You can easily get a spare third-party battery for just a few bucks.I recently purchased a cheap (less than 20 dollars) intervalometer from Amazon, and have started creating time-lapse videos with my T2i. Setting up cool time-lapse, and capturing HD video, are two areas where an articulating screen (like that found on the T3i and 60D) would come in handy, but again, this is not an essential feature, so I am pleased with my T2i. The intervalometer I got through Amazon was third-party, but since it cost about a tenth of the official Canon one, I am very pleased and highly recommend it if you want to take your T2i to the next level.The T2i is an amazing camera. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested, whether you never owned an SLR before, or want a second body as a backup. I love the T2i!", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Great Upgrade (coming from an XSI)", "Author": "Robert Stone", "ReviewID": "ROZ8Z9JAOHPCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera today (finally an available body only since I have no use for the kit lens) and I am awed. I had done a lot of research on this before buying it so I knew what to expect in terms of both the big upgrade issues as well as the little tweaks they have done, some of which turn out to be really terrific. If you are coming from another Canon the menus and interface will be second nature. Based on another very positive review just posted, coming from Nikon it's also an easy step. Here are some early observations:The Best:A huge bump in ISO. This was one of the two main reasons I upgraded from my trusty (and still good) XSI. I have made some test shots and despite going up to an 18 MP sensor the noise is not much of an issue and I shot several pics at ISO 3200 which look quite good. I then shot some in 6400 which did start to show some noise in the low light but still made for serviceable pictures. I am looking forward to seeing what it will do around a campfire at an upcoming camping trip with my daughter! My XSI despite a F/2.8 lens could not do much with that in the past.The other main draw for me was video. I dream of being able to bring just one camera to, say, Disney and have it do double duty and I think this one may do it. So far, I have only shot a couple scenes in fairly low light and focus is a bit of a challenge but by zooming in and allowing the camera to come to focus before the shot it is manageable. I expect this to not be as much of an issue in brighter light. Be sure to enable auto focus during video in the menu - I suspect it is disabled by default due to the noise many lenses make with focusing as that would be recorded as well. I have two USM / \"L\" lenses so that should not be a problem for me but your milage may vary. I also plan to try some manual focusing. Keep in mind that video clips for full 1080P 30 FPS are limited to about 12 minutes - I worried about this a bit until I realized that when I edit my videos shots are rarely longer than 4 minutes (and of that I usually keep just 2 or less). That said, this camera is not the one to choose to record, say, a stage production. For that a dedicated video camera able to record an hour or more at a time is a must.The Good:Better Live View - Live view mode is now much more accessible and in more modes.Sensor Size - 18 MP sensor is nice for cropping and taking full advantage of \"L\" glass if you have it. Other than that, this is not a major draw from my perspective. I would actually have preferred this be a 12 MP camera allowing low-noise great pics to, say, over 20000 ISO.Memory Type - This camera uses SD type cards including the new ultrahigh capacity cards. I know it is a small matter but I like being able to use the cards I have rather than having to but some expensive CF cards (such as used by the 7D). Keep in mind that they recommend Class 6 or higher cards for video (I got a couple 16 GB Class 10 cards for about $40 each which should fit the bill). I'll use my older cards just for stills.Stereo Mic Input - This allows the option of using a better mic than the built in mic. I may never take advantage of that but I suspect I will, actually. Of course, inclusion of a stereo mic would have been even better!Misc - A lot of little things about this camera already impress me. For example, they moved the \"no flash\" setting on the main dial to right next to full auto and my most used setting \"portrait\" mode and away from the far end since they realized a lot of people use it (that's according to a video I saw online with a Canon employee). There are a lot of little touches like that which I have already noticed.The Bad: (really not so bad in many ways)The build quality is not 7D (which I have just handled at a store). The magnesium body on that bad boy just makes it feel very solid and by comparison the T2i does feel not cheap but does feel light. On the other hand less weight is good (especially at places like Disney) and this camera is appropriately being labeled a \"baby 7D\" in terms of sensor chip, etc. Of course, having an extra $1000 in your pocket (or not on your charge card) is another huge advantage over the 7D.It is not a full frame camera. This means there is a \"crop factor\" due to the chip size which effectively multiplies by 1.6 the focal length of lens you are using (as compared to 35 mm film cameras or full-frame cameras like the 5D Mk II. Since I was coming from an XSI which of course is also a smaller sensor for me there is no transition to make here.In summary, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and expect this to be my camera body until my ultimate camera is released (full frame, stereo mic, uses SD cards, useable ISO to >100,000 all for under $1000 - I know, I know this is a pipe dream now but an (old) kid can dream, can't he?)UPDATE: I have had this camera for a couple weeks now and have had the opportunity to shoot hundreds of pictures and quite a few videos. I am still very impressed. Stills are great and the focusing is markedly improved over the XSI. The only blurry shots I get are when panning to follow my dogs running among trees - to the sensor the trees seem to be moving and are deemed the subject - stopping down the lens to increase DOF (or just taking a whole bunch of pictures) is the easy fix.Now, regarding video. It is more challenging than I thought to use a DSLR camera for video. This is more an ergonomic issue with the form factor for the camera than any issue with the T2i itself. Video is of course composed by looking at the LCD screen and so the camera must be held out a bit - and with the weight of a good lens it gets pretty heavy in contrast to typical small camcorders of today. Thinking about it, modern video cameras have gotten to this stage of evolution after over 20 years (anyone remember the old VHS camcorders?), so I guess it is to be expected there would be a difference. Focus is not quick like it is with a good video camera but seems best achieved to me anyway with manual focus. The large, bright LCD screen helps in this regard. The quality of the resulting video is excellent. Although I don't see this as replacing my Sony HD video camera for day-to-day and holiday recording I do think that it will be useable to take the role of both still and video camera during an upcoming trip to Disney. I also suspect as I get more used to it that the ease of use will increase further and perhaps one day it will be my only video camera. Overall, this is a great product and I remain very pleased.UPDATE 2-27-2011Thanks to all for the positive feedback on this review! I am updating after many months with this great camera. I have taken thousands of pictures and continue to be amazed at the quality. The T3i is now coming out and to me appears to be the same camera with a couple upgrades. One feature which may be of interest is the ability to trigger external flash units from the camera itself (the T2i can't do this); but I suspect most people shooting in the studio will have that covered in some other way already. I think the most exciting feature of the T3i is an articulating LCD screen on the back. If you plan to use this camera for a lot of video this may be worth the additional cost. Please note that most of the limitations in my review above for T2i still apply, however. I am hoping for some method of rapid autofocus on a future model. If like me you shoot mostly stills and use the video \"in a pinch\" or when you desire VERY high quality video  - then my recommendation would be to get the T2i and put the money saved into a nice prime lens or perhaps put it away for some \"L\" glass zooms. This camera works great with the 24-70 and 70-200 f2.8 zooms, by the way, the combination for me is unbeatable.As a side note, if you happen to have any 16 GB Class 10 SD cards from AData (as I did) please check out reviews before trusting them with the recording of any important pictures / video.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent photo camera! Video...hmmm", "Author": "Nomad77", "ReviewID": "R13ZF6IX2ZRZ56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I have an extensive background in both photography and video. I was looking for a smaller camera to carry around that could also shoot video. When I heard about this one I thought it would be perfect and it is good, very good BUT its does have its issues... I will try to keep this short and to the point.Pros:1. Superb image quality in both photos and video.  You can expect image quality comparable to a Canon Pro DSLR.  And I am not just saying that. I actually did compare it to our 1Ds MkII.  This camera can produces usable images up to ISO 3200. Noise is there but they  do a good job of controlling it. With this said, it would be noted that there  really isn't that much difference between a Canon 20D and the most expensive DSLR  for photos that will be displayed on the web or in regular size prints.  If you don't really need video then you can save yourself a lot of money and just  get a used 20D :)  I actually still have my original 20D as a backup.2. Amazingly, the 18-55 kit lens turned out to be remarkably good. How good?  Well, within the center area of the frame it would give the more expensive lens a run for their money :)  Where it begins to break down is in corner detail but this is to be expected.  The focusing is also too noisy to use for video, IF you are recording sound.  UPDATE: if you are looking to upgrade the lens, I can recommended the Canon 15-85 IS.3. The built in mic is also very good. Even on regular video cameras this is almost a universal weakness.  If you  are looking for a better mic I can recommend the Rode SVM Stereo Video Mic.  Works very  well with this camera, unlike the Audio Technica 24CM. Its not cheap but good mics never are.  On all of these cameras hiss is a problem to varying degrees especially when recording in a quiet environment.  The quiter the source the more you will hear it. The only way to get remove it is to use an external audio  record like the Zoom H4N or do it in software with something like SoundSoap.4. Light weight compared to the higher end Canon bodies.5. Amazing low light video capability. With a fast lens f2.8 or lower even a Pro video camera can't touch it.  So if shooting in dark places is a big requirement then these cameras are the way to go.Cons:1. This is my biggest problem. I personally find the small body a lot more difficult to handle than the larger  Canon cameras we have. Maybe I am just use to the larger bodies but they are a lot more natural and easier  to work with.  If you shoot pro or semi pro get the 7D just for this reason.  The battery grip will help.  I have small hands so I hate to think how it would feel with someone that has large hands. I would highly recommend  you go somewhere and play with the T2i just to see how it feels in your hands.  UPDATE: The BG-E8 battery grip makes a big difference in this regard!2. For my personal taste I find the T2i to over expose a bit.  This could be related to the Peripheral Illumination  Correction, Highlight Priority, etc. I usually just under expose by 1/3 of a stop to compensate for this.3. My 2nd big disappointment is the video. The video quality is superb this is not the issue. Where the problem lies  is in actually using the camera as a video camera.  It has two big problems in this regard: the manual zoom and lack  of auto focus. It is practically impossible to hold the camera steady and do a smooth zoom in or out. Panning and zooming  at the same time is almost impossible.  A regular video camera have electronic zoom controls that allows you to zoom  in and out very smoothly. The other problem is lack of auto focus. Sure you can refocus manually but again very difficult  to hold the camera steady and focus.  Using the camera auto focus in video mode is possible but its really slow and  the mic will pick up the noise from the lens as it hunts for the focus. For me, this means, the camera is more useful  for recording short video clips not a full video shoot e.g. shooting a whole wedding. I don't feel it can replace a regular  video camera as yet. For example, if you are thinking of using this camera to shoot your kids running around, it can do it,  but there will be a lot of out of focus parts because it cannot track a subject like a regular video camera can and you  won't be able to adjust the focus quickly enough either.  UPDATE: the video can work for the most part, IF you shoot with the intent of editing the final video.  A SLR will require  a bit more post production work than a regular video camera but the video quality will be superior.  It works more like  a professional film camera they use in movies than the video cameras we know. But with that said, this camera still has  some real issues. Neither the shutter or aperture is continuous. You can only change them in 1/3 intervals...enough to  cause a jump in exposure in many instances. On top of that you cannot change anything without recording the clicking  noise the dial makes when you change the values. If you are using the mic in or on the camera this is a problem.  With this camera you have to setup a scene, setup your exposure, set your focus, and shoot the scene. Don't plan on  making any changes while you are shooting.  So while the manual control is nice its not usable while shooting a scene.If you can live with the Cons. Its a great camera that offers image quality comparable to any high end Canon model.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "You can't get better than this for under $1000", "Author": "J. Van Wagenen", "ReviewID": "RHUT2AIYFYPOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a frequent upgrader and loyal Canon fan. I traded up from an XSi last year to the T1i, and now this year to the T2i. I was within days of ordering the 7D until they announced the T2i, with all the features I wanted from the 7D at half the cost. I immediately pre-ordered the T2i and have been having some fun with it over the last 24 hours. The verdict so far? I am in love with this SLR.I believe the last few iterations in the Rebel series have been comparable in quality. The T2i shares much of the same pros and cons with its predecessors, and ultimately, not too much has really changed. That said, the very minor things that did change were huge to me. I'm big into video, which is what got me looking into the 7D. Both the 7D and the T2i have the stereo audio input jack. My T1i just had the built-in mono mic which was unacceptable for someone who is doing more than home videos with this camera. So that feature, along with full manual control of video recording (not available in T1i), and 1080/24p (and 30p if that's your preference) makes this a common sense upgrade if you're serious about video. 720p/60 is also really cool for the silky smooth framerate, although I personally find the movie-like feel of 24p video best.As for what the camera is really made for, still photography, it is still the king at (in the mid-entry-level DSLR class). 18 megapixels really, truly is more than any person really needs. My XSi from a couple years back met all my needs with 12mp, however, 18 creates for even better bragging rights to the general public. \"How many megapixies is that thingy? Eighteen? OMG! You are such a pro!\" Anyway, back on track now. The noise levels in most photos I've taken are pretty decent for 18 megapixels. It's comparable to the noise on the 15MP T1i from what I've experienced so far. 6400 ISO is now a default option instead of an expanded setting (12800 ISO still is), which is nice to have, though you'll hopefully never have to use it.The kit lens is of course the same old 18-55 I've bought practically 5 times over now. A great budget lens and excellent value, but I absolutely can't go back to using it after buying some of the better lenses Canon has to offer. If the money's there, you will not regret investing another few hundred dollars some better glass. Otherwise, the 18-55 is a great lens to start out with.Only major complaint I have is the white balance in incandescent lighting still isn't as accurate as I'd like. I also wish they kept the same LP-E5 battery so the two I already have would be compatible with both of my cameras. And a nitpick, the \"Rebel\" name is stupid, to be completely honest. It should be named \"550D\" as it is in the Europe market. SDXC support is cool, but I can't really comment on it as I'll be using SDHC cards for the foreseeable future. Oh, and the slightly redesigned buttons are a welcome change. A little more ergonomic than before.In conclusion, if you're thinking about upgrading from a T1i, there isn't really a compelling reason to unless you are okay spending hundreds just for the sake of having the latest in gadgetry (what I do), UNLESS you are in it for the video support, which is AMAZING at this price point. You used to have to spend at least a couple thousand on a professional camcorder to get the kind of video support that you can now get in a consumer DSLR at a very reasonable price. Thanks, Canon!

It is also good for trips, taking pictures of kids, or in any other situation where you don't want to change lenses.

Minimal shutter lag, good low-light performance, nice video.- Relatively light (about 1 kg / 2 pounds with lens), again good for trips.Cons:- Price- Built-in flash is not so great. Also when taking pictures on wide angle setting, lens creates a shade.- No autofocus when zooming while taking video, pressing shutter button half way focuses the picture.- Focus in live picture mode is slow (even slower than on most point and shoot cameras)Other Recommendations:- Make sure to get UV filter (mostly for protecting the lens), and a spare battery (I've got the Opteka one for ~$13).", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "A solid camera!...with one caveat", "Author": "Just another reviewer", "ReviewID": "RYCYGQF342KJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got my T2i/550D. Tested it with a few shots using my trusty 28-135mm IS lens. Other people have already highly praised this camera. For those looking to decide whether not to upgrade from XSI (or any other camera), here's a run down:1) AUTOFOCUS:the T2i's autofocus beats the XSI hands down. I've had the xsi for two years and while i was happy with it overall, there were often moments of soft shots. Do a search for \"front-focus\"...it'll show a lot of threads that was problematic of the XSI. No such issues with the T2i. It locks on focus quickly and effortlessly and pictures turn out very sharp using my 28-135mm IS lens. I can get quality shots even at 1/10s handheld and 3200 iso in low light, but that's also dependent on the IS of the lens.2) METERINGThe T2i inherits the 7d's metering system. I like it. color tones are more accurate and appropriate to reflect how an object really looks. One thing to consider, if you accidently set white balance to incandescent light while u take shots w/o flash and happen to use flash on the image, the end result will be a picture w/ a heavy blue cast. If it's shot in raw, easily edited in dpp.3) EXPOSUREI have a gut feeling that the T2i's sensor is a tad bit over sensitive causing pictures to be slightly over-exposed compared to my XSI. I think i'll learn with time. On a typical shot, I think the XSI has a color that's a tad bit richer/pleasing in jpeg. Haven't tried out raw. Still tweaking the settings of my t2i.4) BATTERY LIFEHaven't tried it long enuff and will comment later. The charger has a cord. I suspect it might be canon's way of saving money to allow for different cords to be shipped w/ different units depending on the country. On first charge, i got out 400 shots w/ about 20 being flash shots when battery meter was at half. I had another event to go to so I recharged it at that point. Took about 1-2 hrs to recharge. For those looking to generic batteries, there's discussions on dpreview of generic batteries from ebay that last 600 shots while battery meter still being full. After that, it sharply goes down in half and empty so a little more unpredictable than the canon ones but battery life still terrific.5) BUILD QUALITYSeems almost as sturdy as the XSI. However, noticed battery door on T2i seems a bit loose and not snug like XSI. The little knob on the right next to the shutter (that you use to adjust the AF points) seems more sturdy on the xsi than the T2i. i.e. on the T2i, if u apply a bit of pressure, it rocks a bit but doesn't do the same on my old xsi.6) LCDThe t2i's lcd screen is amazing. Very vibrant and lots of pixels. Much better than XSI's. I'd recommend getting an lcd protector (plastic film) to add here. I'd recommend you get a 3.5 to 4\" lcd protector and cut it out to fit the LCD screen. The ones on ebay that advertise \"T2i screen protector\" tend to be 1-2mm smaller than advertised since the LCD borders itself slightly curved.7) VALUEAt $799 for camera alone, this is the best value u can get right now for a camera that does 1080p video. The technology is here to stay. Best thing about this camera are 1) video at 1080p 2) 7d's metering system 3) usable iso 3200 that looks better than iso 400 on my canon point and shoot. Getting the camera alone is hard if you already have a set of lenses for this camera. If you decide to get the kit lens instead (18-55mm IS), you can sell the kit lens for around $90-100.8)SOFTWAREThe main thing I use is DPP to process RAW. One major fault with it is that you need 1024x768 screen to install/run it. As a result, it won't run on my netbook unless I attach a hdtv or external monitor to it. I have the Lenovo S10-2. Works fine on my regular laptop. You can also use EOS Utility to added your name/contact info to all the images taken.9) VIDEOTo be honest, video recording isn't very intuitive the first time I tried it. You have to turn the knob to the video recorder icon. Then you pressure the button for live view/red dot to record. It doesn't say the amount of time you've recorded unless you press the DISP button. You can also take photos during the recording by pressing the shutter button but that will add noise to video. Now that I've gotten used to it, not a major problem and makes sense. The AF mechanism of the 28-125 mm IS lens constantly makes noise during this time.10) MEMORY CARDI use a Sandisk Extreme III Class 6 SDHC 8 gb/4gb card. Takes all my videos w/o problems even at 1920x1080 at 30 fps.SOME CONCERNS:A) WHITE DOTSFor those new to this camera, at high ISO i.e. 3200+, you will see intermittent white dots that appear out of nowhere. It's like white speckles. This can be seen on dpreview's review of the t2i on 3200 ISO and even on the 7d. These are noise/hot pixels, and not dead pixels. You can either remove them in photoshop using the dust/scratch removal w/ radius 1 and threshold 10. Or, you can turn on high ISO noise reduction. You don't need to send the camera to manufacturer for this issue.B) OVEREXPOSUREI have the gut feeling that this camera's ultra sensitive senors tends to overexposed. Outdoors, I'd have to change the exposure compensation a bit up to -1 to get the desired exposure. Of note, where the focus points are centered also determines what metering is done for the image.C) SLOW AUTOFOCUS WITH CONTRAST DETECTAF using the contrast detect method w/ Liveview is slow and noisy. However, it's improved over XSI and easier to engage. Just press the Live view icon and start shooting.D) NO MINI-HDMI CABLE IN BOX TO STREAM TO TVI didn't find an mini-HDMI cable in my camera to stream to tv. Ordered one through ebay for $5. For $900, you would think they'd include this.E) RED AUTOFOCUS POINTS APPEAR BLURRY:When you look through the viewfinder, you'll sometimes notice that the AF points are blurry, particularly the lower ones which has appearance of reddish halo around them. This is likely due to diffraction and should not affect the ability of camera to focus properly.F) POSSIBLE FRONT FOCUS ISSUE:One poster on dpreview claims that the camera front focuses on fast lenses such as the 50mm f/1.4 lens. Read the thread for details. Personally, I've used the 28-135mm IS lens w/o focusing issues.[...]", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Deservedly top of the line", "Author": "Photoleif", "ReviewID": "R1417X84UDI3PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many good things have been said about this camera. It is superlative in most ways that count for most users. See the other reviews for details of just how excellent a camera this is. I'll instead offer a few summary opinions and observations:1) Upgrading from an XTi or higher will be very easy for you -- same lenses, many similar controls2) Don't expect wonders from the kit lens. It is noisy, cheap-feeling, has a primitive and slow USM, uses a plastic (not metal) bayonet, and hunts hopelessly when autofocusing in anything but ideal light. It is altogether not worth the $100. Getting the camera now, is.3) ISO response really is amazing. ISO 800 with my XTi is like ISO 3200 with the T2i. ISO 12800 is entirely usable in a pinch. It is not the horror story you might expect. You can also push it two stops further to the equivalent of 51,200, though I can say the results are ugly. They are the same kind of ugly that an XTi pushed two stops results in, with its ISO6400 equivalent push. These comparisons are based on visual comparison between non-noise reduced images. When you apply even mild NR using the DPP software, ISO12,800 quickly becomes a viable tool, rather than the butt of jokes.4) Auto-ISO is finally here! Canon implemented it right, where you the user can limit the auto-selectable range.5) Adobe has not caught up to the latest .CR2 RAW file format as of this writing (3/17). The latest ACR is 5.6, and we really really need a 5.7 patch for CS4. Until that is released, you'll need to scrape by with other plugins or programs.6) Video capabilities meet high expectations. Do however follow the booklet instructions and use at least a SD class 6 card (class 10 preferable). I'm using a class 6 and get some jerkiness at 720p. It just can't keep up. So don't blame the camera until you give it a big pipe to write to.7) Remote control? Impressively, yes. If you have a long USB cable, you can make some use of the EOS Utility software's remote control functionality, which includes controlling not only the normal features of the camera, but as well, you can schedule photos to be taken periodically (think time-lapse). You also use this software to register your name and copyright statement, if you wish, as imprints on every photo's EXIF.Overall a great purchase, well worth its price for ISO response and 18 megapixels, but it offers quite a bit more. I'm very pleased.2012-Feb-28 update. I'm still using the T2i, and still pleased with it. Adobe of course has released a new RAW plugin and in fact if you're running CS4, you have to forever stay with the 5.7 beta since higher versions aren't CS4-compatible. I have switched entirely to class 10 SDHC cards to avoid video write issues and quickly empty the buffer when taking shots in quick succession. I stand by my comments about the kit lens, though to its credit it actually produces sharper images than my 28-70L glass. Yes, really. I've tested that using a USAF test target.

I was a young amateur SLR hobby-photographer 20 years ago; I mostly stopped buying film but never purchased anything more than a compact digital point'n'shoot for mediocre memory-shots. This DSLR was worth the wait. I buy a lot at Amazon but don't review much; this is an exception.  I'll try not to reiterate too much, but I'll endorse some of the points in other reviews, and then offer some of my own thoughts.Endorsements:* Indeed, image quality is fantastic; 18MP is not \"too much\" for the APS-C-size sensor.  Low-light performance is also great.  But rather than listening to my broad statements (or those of other reviewers), Just read through the many pages of www.[amazon removed the website name - but it's the same review site that they feature near the top of this camera's page, or if you just google for \"digital photography reviews\" it should be the first hit].com review, including the comparisons with \"competitor\" cameras.  The bottom line: is the T2i light-years better than all competitors at a similar price: no; but is it very good, often equaling its own master-at-twice-the-price EOS 7D: YES!* No, no stereo mic and silent lens operation like the Panasonic GH1, but the standard stereo mic jack resolves this for me.  If I want fantastic sound, then I want two mics on a stereo mic bar out on a boom anyway.  In fact, I prefer this mic-input over the high-quality built-in stereo mic of the GH1 (and the few other new-comers that boast built-in stereo mics).* I will side with those who appreciate the video qualities of the camera.  No, it's probably not the right camera for taping the kids' full basketball games (in 1080p HD!?), where you may want electronic zoom and quiet auto-focus (though a better lens would help with the auto-focus problem a little).  But if you wonder what kind of masterpiece videos can be taken with this gem, google around for T2i videos and prepare to be awed.  The community of  artistic videographers is having a hay-day with the T2i, Panasonic GH1/GF1, and  a (very) few others.  These stand out in a class of their own.  And the T2i, with 60fps 720p stands on its own, really, enabling some incredible slow-motion effects.  Indeed, as has been mentioned, you can't get an interchangeable-lens video camera with a large sensor like this for anywhere near the price of this camera.  Oh, and yes, make sure you have at least a Class-6 SD card, preferably Class-10, apparently (though I only have a Class-6 card and it's done ok so far), before you blame the camera for choppiness, and make sure you have a fast computer with a fast video-card before you blame the camera for taking unwatchable video.* Indeed, indoor auto-white-balance doesn't seem perfect.  But the auto-ISO works pretty well; thank you Canon for the ability to limit the ceiling on it - that makes it worth using.My additional thoughts:* Yes, the body is light.  It's not a professional all-magnesium brick that you can leave out in the snow and rain every night as one reviewer elsewhere likes to do with his professional Canons.  But it's also not entirely \"plastic\", as some reviewers suggest.  It's a stainless steel chassis (though who knows what gauge) with a polycarbonate resin / glass fiber shell (ok, yeah, plastic).  It does \"feel\" light enough to be all plastic.  I wouldn't treat it like a professional brick, but I also appreciate the advantages of its light weight.  In my opinion: it feels light without feeling cheap.  Of course, compared to a solid Magnesium, I might be inclined to say it feels cheap.  To hold, that is.  The function of the controls does _not_ feel cheap.  Also worth noting: I have medium-small hands and have no trouble operating all of the controls _with_ thin gloves on; the profile and controls may not be acceptable to the largest-handed pro photographers, but I wouldn't read too much into those negative comments.  And, finally, I, too, can't wait for camera-armor to produce a mold for the T2i (with the cutout for the new video button) so that I don't have to worry as much that the body isn't brick solid.* The kit lens may be relatively slow at f3.5 and may be plastic, but it really is a great start lens its price.  You'll find a faster (f1.8) plastic lens for the same price, but it won't have image-stabilization (though the argument that you won't need it at f1.8 has some merit).  It really is quite sharp, for the money.  It does hunt a little for (auto-)focus in imperfect conditions, but it's not clear to me (yet) that this is all the fault of the lens.  The hunting _noise_ (audible noise, that is), on the other hand, clearly marks it as an inexpensive lens.* Battery: I don't have enough experience with it yet to comment much on its performance, other than to refer to the stats according to CIPA standards.  But I did notice that you can choose your background color for the LCD, where settings are displayed.  I changed mine from the default white background to a dark background.  If my hypothesis is right, this will save a little power.  You can also reduce the amount of time a shot is displayed on the LCD after it's taken.  Or you can turn the LCD off altogether, which is likely to save a healthy bit of juice.Like I said: I'll leave a great deal unsaid because other reviewers have already said it.  I did a lot of research over the last 5 monhttp://www.amazon.com/review/edit-reviewths and finally concluded that this newcomer was \"the one\" for me.  Still, I watched developments for a few more weeks before making my purchase.  Bottom line: this is a 5-star purchase.UPDATE: I emailed camera-armor, and they reported: \"We currently do not have any plans on releasing Camera Armor for the Canon T2i.  We apologize for the disappointment.\"  But they say to stay tuned for new products.  Perhaps the plans are around the corner even if the product is not as near as hoped.  I'd be interested in knowing how well the Xsi/T1i's armor (MADE Products CA-1135-BLK Camera Armor for Canon XSI Digital SLR Cameras (Black)) would work -- it looks to me like the movie-record button might be covered, but otherwise the fit might be right.

I have had more expensive cameras (Nikon D700), but considering value and price, the Canon T2i tops them all. I know the T2i only has a APS-C sized sensor, but the photos look great. The ergonomics of the camera are the best. Controls are easy to use, and you are just a touch away from changing any setting on the camera.IMAGE QUALITY: Image quality is amazing. I took some shots of the blossoms on a flowering plum tree and had the photos enlarged to 10x12. They are perfect. The blossoms are sharp, clear, and the colors are right on. Even when you use auto ISO indoors, I find that photos that are enlarged up to 10\"x12\" are perfect, even at 800 ISO.SDHC CARD: I purchased a Sandisk 8GB HDHC card (class 10) for the camera.

Look around the net and see what is being done with this camera, even at night.CANON 18-55mm LENS: I'm not impressed with the kit lens on the camera, but it works. I purchased an EF 28mm f1.8 and a EF 28-135mm IS, and the glass on these two lenses makes a nice difference, especially if you plan on enlarging your photos.CAMERA QUALITY: The body of the camera is not built like the Nikon D700, which costs over $2,300 and weighs over two pounds. It feels like plastic but doesn't really appear to be cheap. The body only weighs 18.7 ounces, including the battery and card. It feels light-weight without being cheap. The control knobs and buttons have a nice feel, and function well. The camera body is a little small, but I wouldn't go back to the D700.LCD MONITOR: The monitor on the Canon T2i is awesome! It has a 3:2 aspect ratio and is 3\" wide. It has 1.04 million dots, which means it is very, very sharp. I have used the monitor in the sunlight, and it is still easy to read and exceptionally bright. You can also display the control functions on the screen in four different colors, which is quite nice.IMPORTANT FEATURES: Canon's Auto Lighting Optimizer really works and is designed to enhance shadow detail and even add contrast if it is needed. It also has Peripheral Illumination Correction which tends to reduce the darkness in the corners. The Highlight Tone Priority tends to improve the overall look of highlights which can sometimes be rather harsh.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Everything a Serious Photographer Could Wish For (And Less)", "Author": "Duckman", "ReviewID": "R29ULWBM4OBUBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I worked as a pro photographer for nearly forty years making it through the digital transition before closing down my studio as I transitioned into a new career, frankly somewhat tired and bored with the entire imaging process.  For the last seven or eight years I hardly touched my cameras being satisfied to take well composed 'snap' images with a fine pocket digital camera. But when, some weeks ago, I was asked to help a family member develop their imaging skills and found myself once again handling an SLR the bug returned.My earlier experience with a digital SLR was with an early Nikon Dx. This was able to use the large assortment or pre auto focus lenses I had from my studio days. But a look at the presently available models led me to quickly realize that I'd be better off starting from scratch than insisting that my new system integrate in with my old and in truth out-of-date Nikon system. And once that determination was made I quickly settled on the Canon T2i as the heart of a new setup.Why the T2i?  The key determinants were size (I preferred the smaller, lighter body and lenses that come with the smaller sensor size), lens availability, capability and price. All of these factors came together perfectly in this camera.My initial system consists of a T2i body, two 'kit' lenses (The 18-55 and the 550-250 zooms) and the non-kit 60mm macro. All are EF-S lenses and are thus idealized for the smaller sensor size. I hope to shortly add a 10-22 EF-S zoom to my lens collection.The so-called 'kit' lenses are amazingly capable. That such optical quality can be coupled to an effective image stabilization system and still sell for their relatively low prices amazes me. But that said they do feel a bit light and chintzy compared to the somewhat more traditional construction and feel of the non-kit Macro.  The fact that they have plastic mounts is especially off-putting. But that said \"plastic\" today is not what it used to be. After all, fully crash worthy motorcycle helmets, too, are made of \"plastic.\"The T2I has a very well designed interface. Its roots may have started in the 'starter camera' level, but its also has a full compliment of modes for those who understand how and why shutter speed, aperture, and exposure influence the final image. For a traditionalist such as myself the only limitation (if I might call it that) is in learning to become as quick and intuitive controlling those factors as I became over the years with a shutter speed dial, an aperture ring, and a traditional meter readout.In the end what matters is the quality of the image and here the T2i far exceeds my expectations. (As does, I might add, its capability in relatively low light.)My learning curve has really just begun with this camera, but already it is starting to disappear in my hand, freeing my mind to concentrate on the image instead of the equipment.Bottom line? I could not recommend this camera more highly for anyone looking to expand their visual horizons beyond the capabilities of a fully automatic pocket camera.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "c-mac", "ReviewID": "R8S4QS8B6EXO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is simply amazing.  I am not a professional photographer - but I wanted to get better pictures than a point and shoot digital camera.  What can I say? This thing is an easy camera to use with a ton of features.Coming from a point/shoot world -- this camera was easy to use right out of the box on auto mode.  I don't have the steadiest of hands but I could take very nice pictures with this, even in low light.  Blacks looked black (without grain in the picture, like many cameras produce in low light).  The default pic size is huge (5K x 3K or something like that).  I used a 32GB SDHC which rates at about 3979 pics at this size.Rapid shot was a nice feature.  The built in screen is large and very clear.  Looks like it may actually be HD resolution.Video capture was decent.  It is full 1080, and even though it can do 30p, I think 24p is better.  Like many video cameras, the video capture is not so good in lower light (where flash would be used for a still).Remember I am not an expert photographer so I cannot comment on advanced features.  For the average/novice user, the modes work really well.  The camera is easy to use and produces stellar pictures.

I wanted to get this as a secondary video camera. I've found that it does some things better then my HD video camera and some worse. Most of the test footage I've shot so far I've been amazed with. This camera can take very beautiful video! The catch is its very hard to control during recording. Zooming, focus tracking, and adjusting exposure are all nearly impossible to do smoothly during recording. Its just not set up to be a real video camera. Audio is passible for candid recording but not up to par for production work. It does have a line input but it is auto-gained as best I can tell so you get the bouncing volume mess.Things it does well:- Capture beautiful, and very professional looking video.- Quick recording and non linear capture. Great for home movies, or candid video.Things it does poorly:- Manual controls or mid-recording adjustments- Low light- Highly detailed scenes.

T2i for Me Please!", "Author": "Romain Fravien \"Romain\"", "ReviewID": "RYUDVC5JRVA97", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Four Stars is great coming from me, since I'm not much of a Five Star giver.I have had my T2i since early March (2010). I was one of the lucky ones to find it when it just came out and was hard to find in stock. As someone who was considering the T1i before this one came out, I empathize with those of you trying to decide between the two cameras.Right before I purchased the T2i I rented a T1i for the weekend to see if I was ready to jump into the DSLR world. I wasn't sure if the camera would intimidate me or if the picture quality would be worth the price tag. At the time there were not T2i's to rent. Having had a Canon advance point and shoot, it was easy to adjust to the T1i. I was hooked and needed one. So the question became: \"T1i or T2i?\"The T2i and the T1i look and feel a lot a like. I decided to get the T2i for a few reasons:1. The specs are like a 7D, but I'm paying less than $1000. I particularly like the 63 metering zones and true ISO 6400.2. Button layouts are better on the T2i. With a cursory look, you need to do a double take to see the differences, but they're there and they are time savers. The Quick Control button let's you adjust settings, well, quickly.3. Full HD. Although I do not shoot movies with the camera yet. I figure, if i decide a year or two from now to do it, I don't want to feel tempted to go out and buy a newer camera.4. It's the Latest and Greatest. Again, I don't plan on buying another camera for a while. if the two are not that different, I rather have the new version.What I like about the camera:Great pictures no matter the lighting. I have a Canon S3 IS, and I loved the pictures I took with it outdoors, especially on a sunny day. But when it was time to come indoors and in places with not too much light, I was not as impressed. The T2i shines indoors and outdoors. With my EF 50mm 1.8 II and the right ISO, I have taken pictures that I never could with my S3 IS. Since I have not travelled with it yet, I mostly do portraits of my family. I also love the way it isolated the subject and the color accuracy.I shoot mostly with the kit lens and the 50mm 1.8. I and everybody I show my pictures to love them. That is to say, the kit lens is just fine for me. I haven't trained my eyes yet, so maybe I'll look back and shake my head at some of the shots. Until I do, I'll save money on lenses. I plan to pick up a zoom lens and/ or a telephoto lens (for the range, not as a Kit lens replacement).Shooting in RAW. There are those that say amateurs should not shoot in RAW and larger + fine JPEGs are good enough. I don't disagree with that, but for me, I like having all the data to edit with. With JPEGs one can only edit and save so many times before you're pictures started to get really grainy. I was always gun shy about edits, and avoided making too many corrections. With RAW, I have so much room to correct, and I am becoming more confident about post processing.Advice from one newbie amateur to others looking to enter the DSLR world:Set a budget and stick to it. There's a lot of gear out there, and there are the low end and high end prices. Without a budget, you can easily get tempted to go high. If you have the money to go high, great. If you don't have high end money, don't let snooty reviewers or sales people guilt you into blowing your budget. Beware of folks who compare consumer level gear with professional gear. If something is in your price range and you like the results, then go for it, even if it is not as good as Gear X that is 4 times the price.Good luck and happy shopping. Pick a camera and get out there and shoot already!", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from Rebel Xti/400D", "Author": "Skywise", "ReviewID": "R1J9PQIB2CYXVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having been a devoted user of my Rebel Xti for almost 5 years I had no real reason to upgrade for the photography.  But on family trips I carry around both an HD video camera and the Rebel and I was intrigued that maybe I could get away with just using the HD video capabilities of the T2I as well as make use of my wider angle lenses than is available on either my Sony HDR-HC3 or my Canon HFS100.Now I'm a big night shooting/no flash kinda guy so my first tests out of the box were of a statue I have across my lowly lit living room with my EFS 17-55IS lens using the no flash mode.  Right off the bat there was a distinct difference.  The T2i takes a much brighter picture than the Xti.  Normally where I'd have a dimly lit statue with some shadow detail and some graininess (at ISO1600), I had a warmly lit statue showing great detail and no grain at ISO3200.  Now part of this may be attributable to the Auto Lighting Optimizer but switching to manual mode and turning it off made little difference at the same ISO.  I think the sensor is just that much better.I just returned from a trip where I shot about 500 pics plus video and here's my thoughts:Normal/bright light photography is fantastic and very sharp.  My only qualm here is that autofocus seemed to fight me more than my Xti.  Whereas I would put the center focus dot on the object I wanted focused, the camera would inevitably seem to focus on something closer but nearer the edges of the frame.  (Although it just occurred to me that I never tried changing the focusing settings... I believe it was set to AI Focus).Low light photography is great.  White balance is still off but better than the Xti.  With my Xti I had adopted the habit of using the no-flash mode to determine the correct Av setting and then would switch to Aperture priority mode to get a RAW picture that I could then light properly in photoshop.  Now that RAW is available in all the automatic modes I could just set no-flash mode and, for the most part, the camera would take the picture I wanted.  Although occasionally the auto mode will adjust the settings to make a dark picture overly bright.  (IE I took a picture of a neon sign on a store front and the camera adjusted the scene so that the store front became \"normally\" lit even though the neon sign took up 80% of the scene and the neon sign just bloomed over everything.  This looked good on the Camera's LED display but was all wrong once I viewed it on the computer monitor.  Also, brightly lit objects tend to get overblown and lose detail if shooting something darker in general.  But, again, this might be related to the auto-lighting optimizer.HD Video is fantastic but also comes with caveats.  You can't treat this like a camcorder where you turn the camera on, point, shoot and zoom away.  The camera will allow you to autofocus while videoing but, depending on the lens, there may be some searching of the lens or some \"knocking\" as the AF finely adjusts before it locks.  While this is occurring the microphone will pick up the lens motion (with a USM lens this isn't that bad but it is noticeable), but worse is that in a low light situation, the picture will be brightened *on the video as its recorded* to assist the autofocus.  Also note there's no image stabilizer so every foot step shows up.  For that reason you have to think a little bit about the shot ahead of time (IE autofocus or manually set the lighting ahead of time before beginning recording).  Zooming is about as smooth as you can turn your wrist (and suddenly the 17-55's infamous zoom dead space becomes a big issue!).  Note also that you're limited to 12 minutes of recording at a time.  Microphone quality is excellent for what it is.My issues aside, this is a great camera and I don't hesitate to recommend it.  Can I get away without carrying the camcorder around?  Maybe.  The camcorder and the T2i merge/blur functionality but each has distinct strengths and weaknesses (image stabilization/seamless auto focusing vs convenience and better, wider lenses.)  If you're going to be moving around and chasing camera subjects, the camcorder is a better tool, if you've got mostly umoving objects where you can better control the shot from a fixed position, the T2i will come out ahead.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "My first SLR and I love it!", "Author": "solidyouth", "ReviewID": "R1ECYMAQL1F7NX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 15 years old and this is my first SLR camera.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R2HXSJC1HMZFEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been reading through the other reviews here and some of the negative ones seem to miss the point of this camera.  I'm giving it a five star review.  Does that mean the camera's perfect?  No - but it is as good at what it does as you're going to find in this price range.  Want better build quality, a more comfortable (but bigger) body, extra knobs and buttons and LCD screens?  Then buy a 60D or 7D - this is not the camera for you.  This is an entry level DSLR, and I'm reviewing it as such, not in comparison to higher-priced semi-professional DSLRs.  Yes, there are some compromises - that's why the price is what it is.  On the other hand, this camera has the same sensor and image processor (yes, exactly the same) as Canon's 60D, so if all you care about is high quality pictures and video, you're not going to do any better than this without spending thousands of dollars.I'm a Rebel veteran - my first was a 35mm Rebel 2000 in 1999, which was the first entry-level SLR ever to feature a shiftable program mode.  Canon's Rebel line always seems to have a few features that its direct entry-level competitors don't, and I keep buying them as a result.  My last Rebel was a Rebel XT, which the T2i is replacing for me.The T2i sensor blows the doors off the Rebel XT.  My first shot (in program mode) ended up being automatically set at 3200 ISO - something the XT wasn't even capable of - and it looked as good as the XT did at 200 ISO!  I haven't noticed any focusing or exposure issues yet, although like all Canon cameras, white balance under tungsten light is not great.  This has been going on for so long now that I have to believe it's actually intentional on the part of Canon.  Tungsten light is yellow, and our eyes become accustomed to it so we no longer see it that way when we're under it.  But the Rebel T2i, like all Canon digital cameras ever, will show photos under tungsten light with a distinct yellow cast - maybe faithful to the actual light, but not to what our eyes see.  You can make this look more natural with a custom white balance.I will echo what some say about the video mode being a bit unintuitive, but part of this seems to be so that Canon can allow you to take photos while shooting video - which is a pretty interesting feature.  You first put the camera in video mode, then you focus with the shutter button, then you press the video record button to start recording.  Press it again to stop.  While recording, you can press the shutter button all the way down to take a picture as normal - video will keep recording.  You can also manually focus (which eliminates the possibility of AF noise in the video) and then you don't need to worry about the shutter button in video mode.  This camera does have a jack for an external mic, which is still something of a novelty in an entry-level SLR.  Video quality is excellent, with very low video noise even in low light situations, and sharpness that's really more limited by your lens than anything else (the sensor has more than enough pixels to handle 1080p video).That's another thing - much of the criticism being leveled at this camera in the negative reviews is actually a critique of the lens, which this product (I'm reviewing the body only) doesn't even come with!  Slow auto-focus, noisy auto-focus... these are problems with the lens, not the camera.  I'm using my trusty Sigma 18-50 HSM DC OS lens and I have no problems.  I recommend this lens over the Canon kit lens - which means I recommend the T2i body alone over the kit.  Anyway, remember that this is an SLR - not every issue you might have is the camera's fault, and lenses can be easily changed.Lastly, regarding the build quality and ergonomics.  Canon's Rebel series has always been \"plastic\" and the T2i is no exception.  However, their digital Rebels have always been tougher than they get credit for, with a steel frame underneath a polycarbonate body.  I've dropped my Rebel XT at least a half a dozen times from either hip or eye height onto a mix of surfaces, including bare concrete, with no damage whatsoever - not even a scratch.  The T2i feels pretty much the same as the XT in terms of quality.  I am a little disappointed that the main dial and shutter button are now plastic instead of metal, but this is actually more like the way Rebel cameras used to be built (before the digital era), and the underlying metal structure hasn't really changed from the XT days.  I will say that this camera is more comfortable to hold than the XT, which had no rubberized surfaces at all.  That said, there are some tradeoffs in the ergonomics of this camera - it is a compact SLR, and as such, it is relatively light and easy to walk around with, but a little harder to hold than a full size SLR, with a small grip and button placements that can be fiddly.  Again, this is not a camera intended for people who want a \"big\" SLR.One quick thing to mention - the T3i is out now, so you might consider that, but the T2i will be staying on the market as a somewhat cheaper alternative.  The main thing the T3i has over the T2i is the flipout screen.  I didn't need that, so I went with the T2i.  (The 60D also has a flipout screen, in addition to being larger.)So basically in this range you have the T2i, which is the lowest model with this newish sensor, the T3i, which adds a flipout screen (and a couple minor things like digital zoom), and the 60D, which adds a bigger body, a better viewfinder and a faster continuous shooting speed.  Going below the T2i you will start to lose video modes and resolution.  For me the T2i was the sweet spot, though if you do want that big SLR feel, you can always save up for the 60D.  I personally don't feel like the T3i is enough of an upgrade to justify its extra cost.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "No substitute for an easy to use camcorder.", "Author": "OkieBart", "ReviewID": "R12OE56LX14TZH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had always wanted to get rid of my mini DV tape camcorder, a very nice Panasonic 3 CCD unit, go with solid memory, and combine it with a nice DSLR just to save room in the old camera bag.  Not a bad idea until you actually try it.  I happened to be in California on a visit and went into a Fry's store, lo and behold they had a Canon T2i kit \"In Stock\".....I just had to have it.  Tried it out and after a couple weeks took it back.  So I'm writing this for those of you who like me might not understand what you are getting into if you want to use this camera for video.I really liked the camera as far as still pictures go....lots of nice bells and whistles. But, when you go to shoot video, you had better know what the limitations are before you spend a lot of money and end up with a less than user friendly video shooting experience.  This isn't a camera that you can just aim at a moving subject and expect the camera to do the work.  On a camcorder the camera does focus and exposure.....and all you have to do is compose and zoom that lens in and out.....and in and out....and in and out.  If you have any semi-descent camcorder it can be just that simple........not so with a digital SLR  in video mode.  On the T2i (and other DSLR's) the lens is not designed to be a \"video lens\".  When it is being focused, it is run by a motor or ultrasonic device, and it makes a very small amount of noise....you might not even notice it....but those microphones built into the camera will pick it up....and store it forever on your sound track.  The work around.......turn off automatic focusing.  So now when you go to focus the camera, you have to take your hand and twist the lens, same thing for the zoom function, and unless you are extremely gifted and can move your hand, wrist, and elbow without jerking the camera a little bit....that motion is going to show up on your video.  The work around.....clamp it in a tripod......which is always a good idea for any kind of quality video.  But as you can see....we are getting further and further away from the ease of using a handheld  camcorder that can focus and zoom without the jerking and motor noise that you will experience from your DSLR video.  Another drawback, is when you want to do video on this thing,.......you have to use the LCD display on the back of the camera.....no problem indoors with no direct light bouncing around causing glare.  But let a little glare hit your screen and you won't see much.....and you'll miss the easy to use eyepiece finder on that old camcorder.....the one you could pull up to change viewing angles.  And when you were using that one your camcorder was focusing for you.....and depending on the age and quality of that unit.....it might have been doing a pretty good job.  I didn't find the T2i nearly as well suited to the task of focusing as I would have hoped.It's interesting to go out on the web and do a little research and see some of the Rube Goldberg gizmos people are putting these DSLR's in to turn them into useable video cameras......adding big gears around the lenses then hooking up a crank so you can get a smooth focus or zoom.  Then there are the focusing loupe's, a large black rubber cover that goes over the LCD screen, it has an eyepiece built into the back that lets you view your LCD screen without the glare of other lights.Now if you have the time, money, and enthusiasm for working with these types of challenges, then this camera is going to get you some fantastic high quality video.  If I had more time and a worthy project I would have kept the camera and played with it some more.  Lots of young people are making some very cool video with this thing.But.....if you are a mom who just wants to take some video of the kids first steps.......you may be disappointed.  This camera won't make that easy for you unless you want to hear the lens grinding, and see the jerky motion when you have to manually zoom, and see the auto focus hunting  to get things sharp.  When you take it outside to the swing set to film junior.....you might not be able to see a darn thing on the screen.  So my vote is for a small flash memory based camcorder just to pick up those occasional moments in live when you want better than cellphone video.  Just power it on, point and shoot video.  Even though many camcorders can now shoot stills.....they usually do a pretty bad job of it.If you still feel compelled to go with a video capable DSLR.....make sure you can bring it back or trade it should you not find it as easy to use and the commercials make it out to be........maybe even take an SD card to the store and ask if you can put it in the demo camera and try doing some video, I was in the camera section of Best Buy the other day and the sales guy said I would have 30 days to bring it back....no restocking fee.  Wow!  Keep the packaging, documentation, and don't break it and you can take one out and see what I mean about the video options.Hopefully this might help somebody at least investigate the camera a little bit further before buying thinking it will easily handle video  without any assistance.Good LuckOkieBart", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera--far exceeds my expectations", "Author": "Mick \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R15E00OBAL2AMP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought my camera from Adorama.com, shipped to FPO/AP.

The following review reflects only the video side of the camera.First off, if you're like me and are planning on making the DSLR conversion, make sure you know what you're getting into. Examples include the CMOS sensor, the expense of extra lenses, the 4gb file limitations, 4:2:0 color spacing and the over-heating issue.Recording at NTSC 1920x1080 (30p & 24p), 1280x720 (60p) and 640x480 (60p), I felt DSLR's would be the new medium in video recording. The image quality alone is great, although your video files WILL lag on your computer unless they're converted to a format better suited for editing. I use Cineform NeoScene, which quickly converts the videos to Cineform .avi files as well as giving me 4:2:2 color spacing. I also use a Transcend 32gb Class 6 SDHC card and it works GREAT for HD video.With that said, I'm just going to leave it at the videos LOOK amazing, especially with fast lenses. I always keep my Sigma 18-200(28-320 for it's APS-C crop factor) f3.5-6.3 since I prefer to have a decent all-around lens.Over-Heating:Now, I really want to focus on the cons of the Canon T2i's video capabilities. First off is the over-heating issue. While some others have rated the 7D and 5D's over-heating time to around 40 minutes to an hour, I rated my Canon T2i's over-heating issue to about 28-32 minutes of continuous recording on 2 separate occasions at an average 72 degree Fahrenheit room temperature. I'd recommend waiting at least 5 minutes for the sensor to cool down. If you're an event videographer, this may turn you off completely since the time it takes you to cool down could be the most important 5 minutes of an event.External Monitor Support:Another issue I came across is the T2i's compatibility with High Definition Monitors. You CANNOT use a monitor and use the T2i's lcd screen at the same time. I own a 7\" HD monitor with a resolution of 800x480, a VERY high resolution for such a small monitor. I had hoped to be able to use this monitor for focusing purposes WHILE recording...boy was I wrong!! When you plug in your monitor, everything looks great! You can focus easily, you can preview all of your footage with great detail, you can see your images clearly...then you press the record button...for some reason, someone somewhere decided that when you press record, the resolution and aspect ratio should be changed within the camera itself. Your monitor WILL convert to 4:3 aspect ratio and stretch and widen the image out to 16x9, THEN it will add a black bar on the bottom of the image and squeeze it UPWARD while giving you the resolution that's meant to be on the T2i's own lcd screen. Needless to say, using an external monitor during recording is pointless and I wouldn't recommend it.Other:The T2i doesn't offer audio levels and no control over AGC, just like the 7D and 5D. There's no peaking option and forget about using auto focusing.The camera DOES NOT record continuously after it reaches it's 4gb(12 minute) limit. The camera will give a message saying recording has stopped. Once that message pops up, you HAVE TO be on your toes and get ready to press record again after about 1 second.With that out of the way, this is a great camera for aspiring film makers and cinematographers that take time to really set up shots. But if you're looking for a camera to shoot on the fly coverage...stick to video cameras.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great sensor, but: poor ergonomics, no improvement by Canon...", "Author": "ThomasH", "ReviewID": "R151D7Q3ZCZO0D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I will not repeat what others said about issues with video pan/focus, I noticed the same problem and I would recommend to read the other reviews for detail. Lest stay with the central issue here, the photography itself. The small Canon's served me as a 2nd body, and this is the perspective of these comments.I am disappointed by the layout of the controls. Ever since I tried the small EOS-Dxxx cameras ('Digital Rebels'), I liked their small size, weight and down to the earth functionality. They were a great 2nd body for me. As the time progressed and the LCD display got bigger and bigger, the buttons were moved to the right side, and the left side is now devoid any controls. Now seriously, play with with your both hands and tell me: is it really convenient to have left hand useless and the all the controls placed on the right side only? I do not think so. Here Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus, they all do a better job with layout of controls. The LCD display is more central and both hands can operate the camera more efficiently.My other issue is the inconvenience in M (manual) mode with the aperture setting. One has to hold the Av+/- button down and turn the wheel, but despite year long plead for an improvement, the button is still where the nose touches the display. I literally poke myself into my own nose when I use my 24mm TSE shift lens and have to set the aperture in M-mode! Why not to change this at last, please? What's the big deal? Nothing else would be impacted by using a different button for the aperture setting. Naturally, I never liked the connection of self timer and the \"Drive Mode,\" but here Nikon committed the same 'crime' against laws of orthogonal control design...I also certainly do not like Canon's change from CF cards to the SD cards. Now me and all multi-body users have to maintain two sets of memory cards... But, here Nikon users have the same problem as well. I guess, we all have to have now the secondary set of SD cards. Or maybe it's the sign of time? Maybe the SD is poised to be the primary card type?Other than that, once you press the shutter and see the results, Canon must be congratulated. The noise property of this sensor is stunning by present standards, resolution and price. One can even make perfectly well usable small size images with ISO-12800! Unthinkable a few years ago. Surely 2-3 stops better than even the top DX Nikon D300/D300s, the competition is in sweat. Even the house intern alternative EOS-50D is now clearly surpassed by this small camera. The sensor of this Canon is indeed on pair with Canon's top APS-C model EOS-7D. Only the controls are from my standpoint not well designed, but this is something what could be easily improved. Of course the quality of the sensor is the by far most important factor. I am sure all users will be happy with the achieved results.Another great improvement is the LCD display, finally on pair with what see in Nikons: Great color and the display can be viewed tilted or sideways with still excellent color fidelity. Older Canon's LCD display used to change color, or even reverse it dramatically when the camera was tilted.To summarize, I like the results, but I traditionally dislike the use Canon bodies for their design of controls.

I love it. However, today I started getting an error message. Error message 20. I looked it up and it means that there is a mechanical problem and the shutter won't operate and the only way to fix it that I've found is to ship it back to Canon. I did some more research and found that it's a common problem, but I never saw anything about this problem while doing my preliminary research. If I had, I can't say that I wouldn't have bought the camera anyway. It's still under warranty, and Canon is going to fix it, but at my expense for shipping and handling, and there is no telling how long it is going to take to get it back. probably not before my daughter's third birthday party.

I was completely blown away and still am by the quality and specs of this camera.  I've had it for almost a full year now, and have taken thousands of photos in varying conditions with an assortment of Canon accessories.  I've decided it's best to just list the fantastic points about the T2i below and then some other things about it to consider:Pros:-Durable build, yet not made out of heavy metallic materials as many DSLR cameras are-Easy-to-use menu interface, whether you're shooting on full auto, or completely with manual settings-18 Million Pixels is a heck of a lot...I've blown up shots onto canvases and they still look incredible-SD Cards instead of compact Flash - While this may be a con to some, I find that SD Cards are cheaper, easier to carry around, and more universally useable with computers (in terms of having the input slot for it)-Huge range in ISO capabilities making light less of an issue for the camera-Quality kit lens - I exclusively used the 18-55mm lens that comes with it for some time before I expanded my collection to use a zoom lens (55-250mm) and a 50mm lens (the cheap 1.8 version).-Fast shutter speeds - I use mine to shoot action shots at rock and metal concerts...probably a weird use of it but it's incredible at catching mid-air shots and more-Long battery life - I did spring for a second battery soon after buying it as a precaution, but I rarely need it, despite taking 2000-3000 photos in one day at times.-The sensor in the T2i is incredible at maintaining depth of field and capturing quality images, way better than comparable mid-range Nikon camerasCons-Flash - The built in flash is fine, but if you're planning to take a lot of photos in a short amount of time forget about using it, the recycling time on it is far too slow to rely on it.  That being said, Canon offers a number of fantastic Speedlite flashes, I use the Canon Speedlite 430EX II myself.-$$$ The camera is cheap initially, but Canon has really high-priced lenses, that are more expensive than comparable Nikon products.  I still stand by my purchase, but be ready to shell out some serious $$ if you want to expand the possibilities with the camera.All in all I would argue that the T2i is the best deal for someone who's in between beginner/first-time buyer and full-on professional.  If you buy it, I recommend getting an extra battery, a flash (if needed), diffuser, UV filters, and lens hoods.  As for lenses, buy what you need for the type of photography you plan on doing, the 18-55mm is great because it is a good \"one-size fits all\" type of lens that can do all sorts of cool things, but there are specific lenses for specific applications.

Truly love this cam.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "RVVNHKR18WPYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Experiece and Canon Cameras used in past: 40D, 1D Mk III, 500D (T1i), 5D, and now 550D (T2i). I have been using the 550D now for about a month. I use the word 550D instead of T2i as thats what it is called in Asia. T2i and 550D are the same.Image Quality: I usually shoot raw and use the provided Canon DPP Software to adjust the highlight, shadows, and Noise Reduction. I then convert these images to high quality JPG's for sharpening, post processing in Photoshop. The ISO is usable till 3200 and images are surprisingly clean at this high ISO. The new metering system means I tend to get most images accurately exposed. The colours of the 550D are very good. I use manual white balance setting and use a white balance cap to set the WB. So I wont be able to comment much on the auto WB. Overall - the Image Quality is very good especially when used with the L Lenses. Even the kit 18-55 lens delivers. I get more keepers with the 550D.Focus: Although most expert reviews says focusing is not the strength of 550D, in my opinion, the focus is fast, accurate, and consistent. Even in low light it delivers. Agreed it's not going to rival the 7D or the 1D series. However the focus is fast for most purposes including for shooting pictures of my running kids.LCD Screen: Awesome. One of the best LCD's I have seen in DSLR's, prosumers, point and shoot, and mobile phones. Agreed in bright daylight, we are going to have challenges. However, it is the best LCD screen I have seen and one should be able to gauge the picture review even in bright daylight. Any other place, like indoors, overcast sky, etc ... the screen just amazes me with its clarity, and crispness.Ease of use: Given its LCD resolution, I find it very easy to change settings. There are numerous dedicated buttons for important functions. 1D series and XXD series users may have pass through some learning curve as those sets are even more user friendly.Burst mode:  For my kind of shooting, I seldom shoot continuous frames. Occasionally when shooting my kids pictures, I find the FPS offered by 550D to serve my purpose. Video: I don't shoot much video. I shot a couple of clips and found it to be of very high quality.Features: There are lots of Custom settings which will satisfy the needs of most of the photographer. At least for me, the 550D has all the customs settings I use and need.Flash Consistency: I use external flash (580EXII). Flash consistency on Canon systems has improved significantly. I saw the improvements in 500D and I see it continuing in 550D. I am sure glad this is happening as I did have concerns with Flash consistency in the past with Canon systems. 7D has creative lighting which 550D lacks. I do not use creative lighting. So I don't miss it.Viewfinder: The viewfinder is good enough for an APS-C sensor camera. I was fine with these viewfinders until I discovered the viewfinder of a full frame camera with the 5D. I wish somehow manufacturers of APS-C sensor cameras can improve on the viewfinders. To be honest, in 5D, I can gauge the focus, and I can frame the image very easily due to the viewfinder brightness and size. I have to totally rely on 550D for focus as I find it hard to gauge whether the focus is accurate. The good news is, the 550D focus accuracy has not let me down. For framing, I do tend to shoot a bit wider  (in APS-C) than  I would have in full frame and then crop the image for composition aspects, horizon, etc. It's one area where the 5D and full frame cameras just shine and I sorely miss in APS-C cameras. So why do I keep an APS-C camera? For shooting wildlife, and birds with my 100-400 which gives me 160-640mm on this camera. Also when I want to do a walkaround tour, hiking, etc, I use this cam with the 18-200 Canon lens which meets most of my photo opportunities in street photography.Gripes / Wish list: Not too many.I wish Canon would put virtual grids in LCD / viewfinder to help with framing.I wish the viewfinder for APS-C cameras gets bigger and brighter.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Half price 7D!", "Author": "The Doc", "ReviewID": "R39KPEFNFQ6PLP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am not a pro photographer.  BUT, I am a photographer who got into it in the late 70's with the fantastic Olympus OM-2.  Years of photo hobbyism later, this is my fourth Canon Rebel.  My first was the film version, and the last 3 digital.  I really didn't need to upgrade, but was going with my wife on a photo trek, and decided to gift her my camera and jump up as I was interested in shooting 1080HD video.Photographically I am impressed and pleased. I did not use the kit lens, but as it was IS, my wife used it with the older Rebel.  Images were taken with Canon 50mm 1.4., Tamron superzoom, and Tamron 10-20mm.  ALL images were satisfying. Very.

Wasn't sure that I really wanted to upgrade. I mean, what's really the difference between 10MP and 18MP, right? And who cares that it shoots video?!? Seemed kind of gimmicky, and I already have a standard-resolution video camera using miniDV tapes, also bought in 2006. I figured it would be just dropping ca. $900 to say I had the latest tech.Well, I was WRONG! The T2i is outstanding and awe-inspiring. The upgrade from the XTi is well worth it. I really can't say enough good things about the image and video quality. You really just have to see it to believe it. And I don't feel the need anymore to offload the pics to enjoy them since the LCD is so big and bright. I don't mind storing them on the camera until needed for other purposes, carrying it around and showing off my beautiful pics and videos to everyone. Two 16GB SDHC cards are plenty of storage. As a matter of fact, I haven't had to use the second one yet.I really like the new 63-zone metering system inherited from the 7D. It's really hard to take a poorly exposed shot anymore, but I'll keep trying because it's so much fun! Autofocus works fantastic, too. Of course, composing a shot is and has always been up to the photographer. Don't look to any camera to do that for you.Before buying, I saw some negative reviews regarding build/size and video. Let me just say that, although I've never used a metal-bodied camera like the 7D, I have nothing to complain about regarding the build or the size of the T2i. The camera is plenty rugged enough outside of taking it on a safari or through the everglades (although I don't why it wouldn't withstand that with enough protection), and it's plenty big enough even for my largish man-hands. I do have a battery grip on order, more for having two batteries on-board with extended battery life than for the size bonus.Finally, regarding the video: good-bye old video camera. I've seen reviews questioning why you'd want to have video capability in your SLR, whether you'd really use it, and how ineffective they are because you have to accessorize them so heavily to get quality results. All of these evaluations seem irrelevant to a NON-PROFESSIONAL film-maker. The T2i is a perfectly exceptional and convenient replacement for any dedicated video camera, and the video quality is superb--better than my dad's new dedicated SONY HD handi-cam that cost approximately the same as my T2i. It is perfect for family & vacation movies and anything else the non-professional would do with it. And, as has been shown by the number of professionals adopting them, DSLRs are quite capable even for professionals with the proper outfit.I will also say that focusing with video isn't the bear that I've read about or expected. The camera will autofocus for you both before you press the RECORD button, as well as during the filming, if you so desire. Some might say it's slow, but it's no slower than any of the handi-cams I've ever used. Again, this is something that is only relevant to a professional user. There's always manual focusing, too, which isn't hard--no loupe needed. Of course I grew up with a manual-focused 35mm camera. We didn't have autofocus back then (that anyone could afford or that worked worth a damn), and ETTL had just come into wide-spread useage.I really can't say enough good things about this T2i. I don't regret the purchase at all. It's a very worthy upgrade, certainly from any point-and-shoot, definitely from XTi/XS/XSi, and probably also from the T1i. Very enjoyable camera that makes you run around taking pictures of EVERYTHING once again. That alone is worth the money!Edit: I should add that I put the kit lens on my old XTi and am selling it with that. Not a bad lens by any means, but I've moved beyond that. My current in-use lenses are the nifty 50, the 70-200L, the 28-70L, and the Sigma 150mm macro. Superb lenses contribute to superb pics. Another reason to spend less on the body and more on good lenses. And let me just say, \"Wow!\" one more time to the video.

I primarily bought this camera for its video capabilities and so far have not been disappointed. The one problem I have had so far with the T2i isn't even specifically an issue with the camera itself--it's the P.O.S. EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens that comes with the $900 kit (which until very recently was the only T2i sales configuration available here in the United States). The lens is very noisy when auto-focusing, and twisting the lens barrel to zoom feels like sandpaper. It's no biggie since I'm planning on using other lenses and a separate external mike for videography, but seriously--buy this camera in a body-only configuration if you're able to and treat yourself to a better lens. The kit lens sucks.A couple of friends who own the twice-as-expensive Canon 7D are positively green with envy that I've joined their club with a camera that has nearly all of the major features of the 7D at half the price. True, the 7D has the gorgeous weather-sealed magnesium body and a few shooting functions that the T2i/550D lacks, but those were not considerations for me; I treat my toys with great care and would never take a camera out in the rain to begin with. And as I stated at the top of my review, I primarily bought this camera for its videography functions and don't at all miss the few advanced photo functions only the 7D has. Frankly, my decision to purchase the T2i instead of the 7D came down to cost--I'd rather save $800 and upgrade to a nice L-series lens. :)All in all, I'd have to say that the Canon EOS Digital Rebel T2i/550D is one of the best bargains in photography, so what are you waiting for? Well, there are a couple of caveats. As with any brand-new DSLR camera there are a couple of niggling software-related issues that will sort themselves out over time, but here on the bleeding edge they can be an annoyance. Don't consider these deal-killers... more like a couple of fair warnings:1. As of this writing (31 March 2010) the RAW format used by the T2i/550D is NOT compatible with the current release of Adobe's Camera Raw plugin (version 5.6). There are rumors floating around that even when ACR is updated to support the T2i/550D that it will only work with Photoshop CS4 (and CS5, which is being released on 12 April). If you have Photoshop CS3 or earlier, you're either going to have to upgrade once ACR is updated, use some other software package (including the free software that comes with the camera), or shoot JPEGs (not recommended if you want maximum tweakability for your end results).2. For anyone eyeing this camera for videography (especially its film-like 24fps 1080p mode), be warned that the movie format used by the T2i/550D is AVCHD and you're going to need a fairly muscular computer for video editing. Furthermore, you're going to quickly discover that your software choices for editing are extremely limited and can get quite pricey if you want an end-to-end 24fps edit workflow or more advanced capabilities such as color correction, multiple video tracks, etc. In fact, the ONLY sub-$100 software I'm aware of that can edit 24 fps is Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 14 and Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum Edition 9.

This was the perfect opportunity for me to try out the cameras functions, quality and importantly, video capability.The primary reason for buying this particular camera is that it allows me to create depth of field when shooting video. Standard video cameras keep everything in focus. This dSLR allowed you to have your video image crystal clear in the front, and had your background blurred to create depth of field. The difference is remarkable and is comparable to watching daytime soap opera or watching a feature length movie.This camera has a super-fast high speed shutter and high-speed exposure, up to a maximum of 3200 ISO. It shoots 3.7 frames per second in continuous shooting mode. The camera comes with a very smart booklet on photography that provides a quick read that explains what the different settings are on the camera. Importantly, it shows you how you can utilize those settings with actual photo results.We were away for five days and I was actually stunned by the quality of the 18 megapixel photographs that were showing up on the 3 inch LCD screen on camera. The low light capability was incredible. We were in a steak restaurant for my mother-in-law's birthday, and the lighting was very dim. The pictures I took that evening in the restaurant were among the most memorable.We took the kids to swim with the dolphins one morning and I'm extremely pleased that this camera had the ability to shoot high speed photos and take great action shots. My wife was getting frustrated since she has a small point and shoot camera and every time the dolphin would jump in the air and do tricks she would miss the shot since her camera took too long to compose the picture, autofocus, and then take the picture. My camera was able to take beautiful, crystal-clear photos and video of action shots showing the dolphin in midair and interacting with my kids.The 18 mm-55 mm lens produced great quality photo and video images. There was abundant light generated from this lens that I was really happy with. The zoom lens worked perfectly. It was a perfect complement to the smaller lens.The settings are easy to learn, and even my eight-year-old became very proficient at shooting great quality photos and video with this camera. Each of my kids had a chance to play around with the camera and each of them said \"Dad, this camera is great and takes great pictures.\"I am very impressed with the quality of the video.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Entry Level DSLR Camera", "Author": "Dr. Bojan Tunguz", "ReviewID": "R3RJGF9WTZMUWJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most people these days, I have been using digital point and shoot cameras for years, and have greatly enjoyed taking pictures with them with reckless abandon. Soon enough, however, you start appreciating the intrinsic limitations of point and shoot cameras, even the best ones on the market: no matter how sophisticated the camera, shooting objects will never be as sharp as when you saw them with your naked eye, the colors are not exactly what you saw, and unless you have the perfect lighting conditions all of those problems only get exacerbated. Sometimes post-production in Photoshop or a similar program can improve things to a great extent, but even this can only take you so far. For most everyday shooting this still might not be the problem, but if you want to get a bit more sophisticated with your pictures you need to take the plunge and buy a truly qualitatively different camera: a digital SLR. These cameras used to be an almost exclusive domain of professional photographers, but with the improvements in technology and the increased marketplace competition they have become accessible to regular consumers.There are many manufacturers of DSLRs out there, with seemingly more and more entering that space every day. However, there are two well-established brands that still more or less dominate over all the others: Canon and Nikon. If you are an amateur photographer who is just starting out in the DSLR world, chances are you'll do more than fine with any one of those brands. One of the main reasons I decided to go with Canon is that it seems that for about the same price you get more megapixels. I like to play with images in Photoshop, and more pixels in general give you more stuff to play with. 18 megapixels of this camera are more than sufficient for most of my creative needs.This is in fact my second DSLR camera. I've used its predecessor, Canon Digital Rebel XSi, for four years, and have been extremely satisfied with it. The primary reason that I chose to upgrade is that T2i is capable of capturing full HD video, and I've decided that instead of investing into a separate HD video camera an upgrade to my DSLR would do the trick. There are still some limitations to using the DSLR cameras for video purposes (and I'll get to a few of them bellow), but these are far outweighed by the positives. So if you only care about taking still photos, and price is an issue for you, then you'll do more than fine with XSi. However, if you are also interested in video, then T2i is probably the best entry level DSLR camera.The first thing that you'll notice with any DSLR camera is its relative size as compared to dainty point and shoots. You can never carry DSLR around as an afterthought. When you take one around you make a conscious decision to take pictures, and furthermore you will be conspicuous when taking them. These might be some of the considerations to think about when deciding on a switch from point and shoots.In addition to size, you will also notice a very solid feel of this camera. It is not made out of cheap materials, and every part of it has been thoughtfully designed for durability. You shouldn't casually toss this camera around, but it is comforting to know that it can probably withstand most everyday small bumps if they come its way.This camera has many features and settings, and all of this might be overwhelming to a first-time SLR user. In addition to automatic settings that are now also a familiar feature of most point and shoot cameras, there are multiple \"creative\" settings that include various levels of manual control, including a completely manual operation. When you first start shooting I would recommend using these \"creative\" settings to experiment and play with. However, if you are still unsure of what you are doing and there is shot that you absolutely have to take then the automatic settings would be much more appropriate. One of the main improvements of T2i over XSi is the availability of \"Live View\" while shooting in the automatic modes. This means that if you are used to looking at the camera's screen while taking photographs with your point-and-shoot, then you'll have an easy time adjusting to this DSLR.The picture quality of the photographs that I have taken has been spectacular. You will notice a clear difference from the point-and-shoot photograph from the very first shots that you take, and so will all of your friends. Just prepare yourself for becoming the \"designated photographer.\" :) The only problem that I've had is that in low light photographs have pretty noticeable orange glow. I've been able to avoid this only when fiddling with shooting controls in one of the manual modes.Another amazing feature of this camera is the speed with which it takes pictures. At 3.7 frames per second, you will be able to capture some pretty amazing shots if you go into the continuous shooting mode. I've been able to capture electric sparks on the Van Der Graaf generator and some really neat sports action photos.The large 3-inch viewing screen allows you to have a good control over the camera settings, as well as increased ability to frame your shots as you like. T2i's screen resolution is higher than that of XSi, and the screen also appears brighter and with less glare in bright light. The increased viewing resolution helps with ascertaining the quality of the photographs on the fly. It also makes it more enjoyable to view your pictures on the camera itself.As I've mentioned before, this camera has an outstanding video recording capabilities. This is my first experience of shooting video with an interchangeable lens camera, and the difference from the \"regular\" video cameras is quite noticeable. The image is crisp and clear, and depending on your lens it can almost approach the quality of a professional video cameras. There are several different recording modes, which will cover pretty much all of the possible home video situations that you may encounter. However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind when working with video. 1.  When using auto-focusing and image stabilization you will hear noticeable noise coming from the lens' motors. This will be a serious issue whenever you are recording rapidly moving subjects. 2. The in-built microphone is very feeble, and 3. You can't use camera's light for recording in dimly lit settings. These last two issues can easily be dealt with by buying additional equipment. Overall, however, these have not been major issues for me, but you might have different recording needs than I do.Overall I have been extremely satisfied with this camera. Most manufacturers (Canon included) keep coming up with bigger and better models almost every year, but unless you really need some of the latest top-of-the line features you will be more than well served with this camera. I for one don't feel like I have even scratched the surface of what this camera has to offer, and based on my experience with Canon XSi it will probably be more than adequate for most of my photography needs for a foreseeable future.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Entry Level DSLR Camera", "Author": "Dr. Bojan Tunguz", "ReviewID": "R1QKA3PYODFWUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most people these days, I have been using digital point and shoot cameras for years, and have greatly enjoyed taking pictures with them with reckless abandon.

Its successor, the Rebel T3i, doesn't add much to the party, so if you don't need a fold-out screen or flash remote control, this is as much as you're going to need.Being a low-end model, the T2i uses SD cards  instead of CompactFlash, and it has built-in support for EyeFi cards if you happen to like that sort of thing. The 18Mpx image sensor produces very large picture files but is capable of out-resolving any lens you might mount on it. Low light performance is good, and video quality is about what you'd expect from a video-capable DSLR; the bitrate for HD video (H.264 Quicktime format) is nearly 50Mbps, though, meaning you're going to go through a lot of memory cards for any significant length of shoot, and will probably need a lot of horsepower to edit it as well.The flash isn't great, but like most digital cameras it can compensate rather well for a fairly small one. Ergonomically, it's small enough that it can mostly be operated one-handed; it does lack an old-style LCD screen like the 60D and up, so you may have an issue or two working in tight spaces or fast-moving events. It does have all the usual manual and semi-automatic modes, as well as a set of basic auto modes and the interesting \"Creative Auto\" mode that allows the user to bypass the camera settings and just ask for a specific picture look; it's not flexible enough to fool your photography professor, but it'll do for anyone who can't quite get the difference between aperture and exposure, or other terminology like that. (That does lead into questions of ethics and technical knowledge, but if no one's going to be asking you what your Exif tags mean, it probably won't matter and will help you jump ahead with your composition while still working out the kinks.)The step-up models do have their own things going for them, but it's important to remember that in photography, your skill as a shooter is much more important to your final results than the bells and whistles on your camera. Unless you've got ergonomic or professional issues that make the T2i not suited for you (big hands, lots of inclement weather, building a portrait studio on the cheap, an obsession with bells and whistles), this is the best choice for the majority of people wanting a Canon SLR, and arguably one of the best deals going for low-budget filmmakers as well (though because of the 4GB limit on video file sizes, not so much for live TV shoots, since at maximum bitrate, it tops out at 12-minute clips). On top of that, it's one of the main platforms for the Magic Lantern package, which is nearly essential for filmmakers and rather helpful for still photographers as well (the Canon hacking community is hard core, which is one very good reason for buying Canon in the first place).

After reading many reviews and communicating with Canon email support, the Rebel T2i seemed the answer. In some respects it is. Its image quality for stills is an upgrade, especially in low light situations. Its video quality is not so good. This is mostly because the Rebel T2i's optical viewfinder doesn't work for video, only for stills!!! I hadn't found this mentioned anywhere - not on this site, not by Canon support, not in \"unbiased online reviews\"...I cannot comprehend how anyone who actually uses these cameras cannot find the optical viewfinder very important. And regarding stabilization - it is easier to hold the camera steady with an optical viewfinder. I will need to buy an expensive telephoto lens in order to surpass my A720's stabilized zoom, and a battery grip to record a live show non-stop in HD video.

It is a very good cheaper camera with lots of features and a HUGE zoom.I have the T2i and love it (the Rebel XSi didn't look too appealing to me), very good camera for size and cost. The T1i is VERY similar and the T2i is only a small step up. Look closely at the details of the T1, T2, and T3 before choosing.I also have the D60. This is the next step past the T2i. It is a little bigger, heavier, and feels more rugged than the T2i but very similar is most respects. The T3i is almost identical in features to the D60, but at that point I would go for the D60.Recommended accessories:-Tamron AF 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Aspherical IF Macro Zoom Lens for Canon, AWESOME ALL AROUND LENS-Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens, great cheaper large aperture lens-Fotodiox Canon EOS Macro Extension Tube Set Kit for Extreme Close-up, interesting effects and cheap-Abacus24-7 Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable, HIGHLY recommended-Opteka Shutter Release Remote Control Cord, a must have for playing with long exposures-**NOTE** If you want to take HD video, you NEED a Class 10 SD card.

Thank you, Canon.I think the T2i will do fine as a beginner's DSLR -- just turn the dial to \"full auto\" and you will get a very acceptable and usually excellent picture every single time. But the feature set is extensive so it's a great camera for beginners who want to grow. The only real big difference between the T2i and what the pros use is it's not a full frame camera -- but you won't touch full frame for less than $2500 for Canon or Nikon.T2i low light performance, for anybody who hasn't bought a DSLR in a couple of years, is astounding. Pretty much full detail at 3200? Crazy. I can take this camera out into the woods at night and get images of things that I can't even see with my eyes.If you graze the Amazon reviews you can find numerous anecdotal complaints about fuzzy images but I think it's people who are messing with manual settings and not knowing what they're doing. If you increase aperture you can lose sharpness. If you shoot in low light and the autofocus is struggling, you can lose sharpness. Use a tripod! Use faster shutter speed and smaller aperture! Take advantage of the camera being able to shoot at 1600-3200 with very little noise. Or if you can't or don't want to figure it out, don't be ashamed to turn the dial to green and let the camera do the work -- it will usually make very good decisions.Reports that 18 megapixels can mean less resolution than, say, 10 or 12 megapixel DSLRs are also not true and have been debunked.The reason people think that is that 18 megapixels produces such a large image that when you zoom in, you are more likely to see an imperfect focus or camera shake or an incorrect aperture. Since an 18 MP image is so much larger you can zoom in further. Sometimes you're hitting the limit of what your lens can resolve -- if you need sharpeness for gigantic prints, you may have to invest in expensive lenses (though first, PLEASE, meet Mr. Tripod -- you'll be amazed at the difference it can make in sharpness.)If you want to compare T2i performance to other dslrs in a side by side comparison, I recommend the imaging resource comparometer: [...]...The T2i's images are terrifically detailed.Anyway, there are so many great camera choices out there. Probably this one is for people who want to do serious amateur photography and really need the camera's capabilities to shoot landscapes, sports, indoors, wildlife etc. For just general family pictures indoor and outdoor the T2i is overkill -- there are great entry level DSLRs or Micro-four-thirds cameras that will produce fantastic images up to 13 by 19 -- which is as big as most people would ever print. I'd actually look at the entry level Olympus DSLRs (small and wonderful) and the Micro 4-3 Panasonic G-series and Olympus E-P series.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Using for video? About AGC and why you care", "Author": "Douglas M. Pace", "ReviewID": "R384LVGNFLQQJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for five months now and absolutely love the pictures and quality of the video; however, one of the primary reasons I traded up from my T1i to this was stereo audio input.  The EOS T1i recorded 720p video (which is actually fine by me), but I was forced to record with the internal mic, or record audio separately and combine into my video later.  You might be more into video than myself, but I just did not want to spend that much time.  If I can simply attach a nicer quality microphone to record video with high quality audio, it provides a simple fix.  However, after attaching my own studio-quality microphones, I found recordings had a buzz that would grow from any point of silence until the next sound was heard.  This is something called \"automatic gain control,\" or AGC, and is a \"feature\" that you can not turn off.  I never even realized this would be something that I would need to research before purchasing the camera - their own internal microphone does not seem to have this problem, and is certainly of lesser quality than the input I was sending to the camera.After determining the problem in the recorded audio was due to this feature, I have found online petitions (which I have signed) and message boards that complain of this problem (which affects their entire EOS line).  Perhaps I oversimplify the complexity of letting us record audio without their own \"feature\" destroying the quality of it?  Either way, I expect most customers who use the \"line-in\" to be frustrated with the resulting audio, and wanted to ensure others were aware of this, as well as Canon's apparent disinterest in correcting it.  Even more, some have gone to the extreme length of building their own firmware to correct the problem - sadly, Canon modified the firmware on this model to make such changes too difficult.  How about that for sticking it to the customer? \"No, you will not have the feature, and no, I will not let you add the feature.\"All that said, I still love the camera.  I just find I use it for still photos and casual video, recognizing the limitations.Update (12/22/2010):Since my review, I have some good news for both buyers of the T2i as well as potential Canon consumers.1.  The Canon EOS 60D has been introduced which includes the following feature: \"The audio input level can be set to Auto or Manual, up to 64 levels, and a wind filter minimizes unwanted background noise.\"2.  There is an alternative firmware group (search google with \"magic lantern t2i\") which now has an early version of an update to this camera's firmware to give users the ability to control audio.  It is NOT recommended to install this version - they are still working on it, and it will be some time before they have tested enough to recommend everyone use it.Most current T2i owners will not want to replace Canon's delivered firmware with an unsupported version, and most will not like the suggestion they should just buy a newer model to provide features that they were buying in the first place.  When you buy a camera with \"audio line-in\", you think that means recording directly from the input, not having it rendered unusable by constantly modifying the volume.  Neither of these are ideal, but certainly the news is better today than it was just a few months ago.  I am still holding out some hope Canon will release a firmware update to provide users with functionality they thought they were purchasing; however, with the introduction of new models which remove

It's pretty much everything the truly budget filmmaker could want. It takes beautiful stills, and the video is incomparable in its price range. The LCD is brilliant, and the low light capability is fantastic--but more on these gems later.Build Quality: This is pretty one area where I fell it could be improved. I like my cameras to feel solid, and, while it's perfectly decent feeling, it's doesn't have that impenetrable feeling. That being said, if you wanted that, you should be buying the 60D or 7D. Switches and dials are just fine and I haven't had any wear and tear issues anywhere, despite heavy use.Usability: I like it. That being said, it's a very personal preference. I would have liked to have more dedicated dials. With the button-dial combinations, it's perfectly adequate, if not optimal, though. Once again, could use a bit of improvement. Battery life is good, I've found, but you should always have extras on hand, especially when shooting video (really a necessity).LCD: I had to put this in a separate section because it's so good. Magnifique. Pictures and video look brilliant. I can even pull focus on it without needing an LCDVF.Image Qality: Stills look fantastic on this. Paired with the right lens and photographer, you are definitely looking at some good shots. Noise level is good, although in very low-light situations, RAW photos can start to look sketchy, so I'd suggest sticking to JPEG for this purpose unless you have a quality RAW convert with good noise reduction. ISO performance is really good. Paired with the 50mm f/1.8, I feel like a king, walking around shooting without a flash while the other poor people can only stand by and hope their shots don't look like they came from the floor of a Jersey shore nightclub.Video Quality: This is why I bought this camera, and it hasn't let me down. If you pair this with Marvels Cine, or Cinestyle picture styles, you get some pretty meaty dynamic range, which works very nicely in post for color correction. Noise is truly great for this price range. ISO ranges all the way to 1600 are usable for film work, especially after color correction. (Make sure to use a flat picture style!) Although this uses an APS-C crop sensor, that can hardly be avoided unless you have a few grand to drop, and I haven't found it hard to get the depth of field I'm looking for without sacrificing framing, especially with faster lenses.Audio: While you may be thinking it's impossible to get decent in camera audio, think again. If you have Magic Lantern installed, and you should definitely for shooting film, you can easily disable Auto Gain Control (AGC). This, paired with a decent mic preamp (which doesn't have to cost a lot--see the ART USB Dual Pre) can give you really excellent results. Good enough, I dare say, for festival work.Overall: Frankly, I'd like to give this camera an award for budget filmmaking. There is one Caveat though: This award-winning capability is predisposed on have Magic Lantern firmware installed. I won't explain all it can do here, but please, please look into it if you're thinking of buying a T2i/T3i. Without it, it's merely a five-star camera. With it, it's a $2000 dollar nightmaric monstrosity that will leave you saying only \"Beast mode engaged!\"", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT Camera (Great for Skateboarding)", "Author": "Jack S \"Jack\"", "ReviewID": "R6ZFZRQFWY1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera/lens kit is probably the best you can get for the money.  I conducted countless hours of research on Canons, Nikons, and even Sonys.  I was used to using point-and-shoots, and small flip style video cameras to make my videos.  I looked into DSLR's and really wanted a canon.  YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS CAMERA!  It is great for intermediate shooters who want to get their first or second DSLR.  It is very user Friendly, and Fun to use.PROS:FULL HD VIDEO RECORDING60fps HD Recording (AMAZING slow motion!)Manual video controlsMic input18MP Stills! (best for the money, competitors are usually 16MP)Built in image stabilizer (18-55mm lens)Somewhat Compact sizeEase of useFast start up speed (I have caught videos with this camera seconds away from missing a fast moving skate, turns on in about 1 second)PRICE, since the T3i came out, this camera is going down in price, but essentially is the same camera as the T3iCons (If any!):No Flip-out LCD (Not that much of an issue)3.7 max burst rate, not very fast at allNo audio recording level adjustAlmost no low light auto focus (when taking long exposures of moon/stars/light painting)Overall, this camera is amazing.  There are very many accessories and lenses for this camera.  If you want to really get serious about photography or video making, then get THIS camera.  It is GREAT for skate/surf video because of its 60fps mode.  If you are comparing this camera to the T3i, get this camera; the t3i is the same camera with a flip out screen and adjustable volume levels for $100+, i've personally compared the two, and its not worth it (in my opinion).  If you get this camera, consider getting a 50mm f1.8 or 1.4 lens, and a fisheye/wideangle (if you do skate videos/photos).  If you are looking to do mainly surf, but this camera BODY ONLY + a 18-135mm, 55-200mm, or 75-300mm; the kit lens that it comes with doesn't zoom far enough at all.  LOVE THIS CAMERA.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I've owned it since it launched, my thoughts on a great advancement in DSLRs.", "Author": "Bone \"JLLaser-net\"", "ReviewID": "R2ODUQ2M46TYT7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when it first came out and I do have to say that I've really enjoyed it a lot. I have been a little biased in the review because after having it for so long I've come to know it's quirks...First off my biggest annoyance is the menu system. It's really setup poorly. Canon needs to get on the ball and revamp their menus to make them much more user friendly and put the most used options on a main list and it should have explanations built into the menu system for the user to know what they are adjusting and get a better understanding of the option. You shouldn't have to carry around the manual for the camera at all times.For the most part the camera in general is outstanding but I would love to be able to reach 250 for HSS (shutter sync) There are a few tricks to get the camera to work a little better with off camera flash though, like using rear curtain flash and other simple things, depending on how you use it can be to your advantage for a multitude of purposes. The stated fastest sync speed is 200 and I'm consistently able to reach that but go any higher and you'll end up with half an exposed frame due to the mirror not getting out of the way fast enough. While yes you can get around this by using things like live view but you will also run into issues depending on the type of sync that you use. It may not trigger your flash if you are using basic radio triggers, you have to play with the settings to get this to work here, it should be more intuitive than it is.While I do really enjoy the improvements in button layout on the camera I do wish some of the quirks with the rear screen not coming on right away when starting the camera up, even though it's set to,,,, would be fixed in an update. It seems since one of the last releases for updates that portion of the programing got fubard.Video...I've found that if I leave the camera set to +2/3rds exposure and leave it on auto exposure I get the best results for nice bright video but also when you need to refocus it will not brighten up the screen and then drop it back down. Also make sure that you use some form of external mic. If you use the internal mics you will pick up the audio from you moving your hands around the camera and if using the kit lens you will get horrible sounds from the focusing motor... If you are putting the camera on a tripod and can set it and forget it then you may not need to worry about getting a different mic unless you want something more sensitive or directional. The built in mics are meant to pick up just about anything from anywhere and they will do just that.Other than it's quirks I have honestly found that I get some truly amazing photos out of this CAMERA (not video camera). I think some of my complaints have stemmed from the fact that I do a lot of paid work and the little quirks that I have been coming across have truly started to get on my nerves as I think it's getting really close to time for me to upgrade to a pro-body like the 50D MkII. This is a great camera in general though and if you know how to use it and work with it you can truly make some amazing photos but it's not just the camera that really makes the photo, it's the user...You can easily buy a camera for $2,500.00 and turn out crappy photos that no one would want to look at if you don't have a clue as to what you are doing. I've spent the last year and change studying everything I can get my hands on as far as photography books and so on and while I certainly am no Picasso with a camera I have learned a lot and have been able to turn some heads with my work.Probably the best thing about this camera in general is the fact that it will give you shots that you can pretty much crop the living heck out of and still end up with a highly printable copy of. 18mp is far more than most people will ever need and if you continually shoot in RAW you will suck up a lot of hard drive space, ask me how I know... You should seriously consider buying at lest 2 high storage Hard drives (1-2TBs each). Make sure that you duplicate your files on both drives so that if one fails you wont lose them all. Also never keep the drives in the same place. I keep one of my backup drives at a friends house and bring it home for a weekend hear and there and copy my files to it. That way if anything happens to my house I have an offsite backup of all my work and even my post processing. This is probably one of the single most important things you can do to protect your information.All in all, would I buy this camera again if I had to do it all over. CERTAINLY WOULD! but I would have gone with a better lens from the start. The 18-55 is a very short range lens and limiting in it's f/ abilities, I would definitely recommend getting the body only for any DSLR purchaser and selecting just about any other lens to start off with. For a little more you can really open up your cameras abilities. The glass you put on your DSLR is what truly aids in your images. Don't be duped by camera features when it's the lenses that really do make the cameras work best for you.Before buying a camera you need to do a lot of reading on DSLRs and how they work in general so you can know what you are getting into.

I use that one on a tripod (with a ring!).I added a Black Rapid strap which makes this camera even more fabulously portable and easy to use more readily.Get it.

I can appreciate a camera with a super high-quality build. I have owned and used Leica M's and \"pro\" quality SLR's so heavy that they required a servant to lug. The Canon T2i does NOT have the rugged build quality of the \"pro\" cameras. However, it does NOT matter. What DOES matter is that this camera will allow you to take outstanding photographs.I'll repeat... What DOES matter is that this camera will allow you to take outstanding photographs. Furthermore, it is so lightweight and small that I carry it everywhere. My other DSLR is a Canon 5D and it feels huge & heavy compared to the T2i.As far a the ruggedness issue goes, with the same level of care you would treat an iPhone, this camera will last you for years. Buy it and have fun!****Suggestion: If you have some extra money left over after purchasing this camera, buy some good quality lenses. I would suggest a 50mm prime (great portrait lens) for starters. I think the 18-55 kit lens does a fine job for everyday carry but good lenses will last you for many, many years and multiple camera upgrades.  Also, the 270EX flash yields surprisingly good results.Note: Although I normally always try to buy from Amazon, I purchased this from another source (B&H;) due to the pricing nonsense Amazon continues to allow from 3rd party sellers.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "A true joy to use - Easy and fun!", "Author": "Scott Anderson \"Sharpsburg\"", "ReviewID": "R4M2RDIW2KKS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm by no means a professional photographer, but I do take a good bit of semi professional shots of food, landscapes and assorted images for my online reviews and publications.  I was previously doing all that with a Canon 40D but it became to cumbersome and awkward and downright heavy when I had to go from location to location to shoot food images and landscape shots.So, when the Canon T2i came out I looked over the material and decided it was time to sell the Canon 40D and look into a smaller more feature oriented camera, and I've never looked back.  The setup was straightforward out of the box and I was up and running after a quick charge of the battery.  The buttons are well placed and the manual certainly laid out the specifics of what I needed to select if I desired manual, semi auto or automatic settings. I attached hte body strap and was off shooting pictures.The first images taken of my daughter were right on the money and I've been using a Canon 60mm Macro lens along with a Sigma 10-20mm wide angle and the kit lens that came with the camera.  I've also purchased a SanDisk Extreme card that allows for rapid firing of pictures with a quick read/right capability and picked up a new sdhc external card adapter to use for downloading onto to my Macbook.The software including is very easy to install and assisted in setting up my files to get my pictures from my SD card to my external Hard Drive.  I can go on and on with the specifics of the camera or the details of the electronics but others have done so, and I don't want to fill your time with extra words.  Suffice to say that this camera is certainly worth every penny.  It's lighter, more user friendly and gives you the ability to take high quality video, something the 40D never offered.  I'm looking forward to putting this camera through it's paces at the next food test kitchen and family vacation.If you decide to purchase this camera you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "First DSLR", "Author": "Rick Deckard", "ReviewID": "R3UBLUTM6KFPJO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this kit for almost a week now and I couldn't be happier.  Prior to this I had only been using the canon SX10IS 'mega-zoom'-type camera, and other than a collection of film slr's I've never had a digital slr.The settings are a good bit different than my SX10, both in placement and function, but it's very intuitive and I'm reading the user manual (a good habit my uncle impressed upon me).With the SX10 I was addicted to using the articulated LCD because the viewfinder was so small and I like to be as incognito as possible and holding the camera lower down draws less attention.So I was a little wary of switching to a fixed screen.  I got over that almost instantly.  First, the T2i's screen is huge and brilliant, and second because the viewfinder is quite nice and I realize the benefits of stabilization and composition when using the viewfinder.  When you're in viewfinder shooting mode the current settings are displayed on the LCD and when you pull the camera up to your eye this sensor turns off the LCD until the shot or shots are over.  It works instantly and perfectly.I got a extreme class 10 sdhc card with 30 MB/s speed both for helping avoid pauses when shooting continuous and because I read you needed at least a class 6 in order to capitalize on the full-HD video function.The kit lens, the 18-55 has less zoom range than I'm accustomed to but it's good enough to get me started.I was going to add a fixed prime lens first but the low light capability on this camera has me considering getting an 18-200 or something.  I can shoot 1600 ISO in dusk with great exposure and no noise.  Even the 3200 shots look very smooth.  It does have to search a little longer for focus in low light (indoors or dusk).The battery is a LP-E8 which nobody around here has in stock yet though it's available online of course.The first charge out of the box took about 1:15 to display green for fully charged.  And with my excitement at having this I've been shooting like crazy with some flash (built in) and some live view, and the battery holds a charge for me all day with a 3rd to spare.  Still, I'd like to get another as a backup.My jpegs are averaging 11MB straight off the card and I've not tried the RAW format yet.When you turn it on, it comes on instantly and it's ready to shoot instantly.  I suppose this is typical of dslr's.  The camera just feels 'smart' like it's an artificially intelligent being.  I suppose the digic 4 plays a role in that. The pictures it takes are just outstanding and I'm very happy with it.Maybe in a couple years I'll move up to full frame but this should provide excellent images for a long time.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent downgrade", "Author": "S. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2DA30H1U2SSYD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im not going to drag this review out. This information is mainly for those deciding between the 7D and T2i... or for those such as myself, who have the 7D and think they might be able to settle for little less. My purchase of the 7D was mainly due to expectations of shooting alot of sports and birds in flight, which I ended up not doing so much. Also I had always owned higher end Canon bodies such as the 1D and 1D MK II.I was already aware that the T2i basically has the same sensor so image quality of stills and video should be the same.  I sold my 7D and got the T2i and found this to be true. So from an image quality point of view, expect the same result from either body. If you downgrade like I did you will need to expect a different feel. The T2i to me does not feel cheaper as some say, but rather different. Its definitely smaller and you will have to adjust to the controls if your are accustomed to the higher end bodies.My advise to anyone who has neither body but trying to decide on which one is to ask yourself if you are going to be shooting a lot of sports. I would not call the occasional kids baseball game as \" a lot\".  If you shoot occasional then the extra money is best spent on a GOOD SHARP FAST LENS.  You can get fast lenses on the cheap but they will tend to be soft wide open. This ends up in stopping down to gain sharpness and in turn you lose the speed for which you bought the lens for in the first place.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Test Footage from the

For me this alone would have been worth up-grading from my old Rebel XT!Basically, the only thing that I am a bit disappointed with is the auto-focusing feature while taking videos.  As an earlier reviewer indicated, the camera does not have the ability to track the object in the video and therefore when I zoom in or out--the video goes in and out of focus.  I can momentarily press the shutter button half-way down to have the camera re-focus, but this is a big interruption of the video and sometimes it takes a couple seconds for the camera to focus.  I can manually focus the video but this is difficult because to do this all I have to look at for focus is the scene displayed on the LCD. Under many circumstances that just isn't big enough to see if the video is in focus.  I am getting better at doing this.  I'm looking forward to the day Canon manages to include a constant auto-focus feature for this as well!Overall, great camera!", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Got a lemon, and canon support does nothing to help", "Author": "J.M.H. \"SurferMAn\"", "ReviewID": "R1MHVDYMF35RSJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd rebel.I take about 10.000 pictures per year and have a range of Canon quality lenses, I am no professional, but do know how to take a decent photo.Upgraded from an xti (and am now back to using that instead of the T2i)I got a lemon that takes pictures that are out of focus, horrendously noisy and thus useless.

This is my third Digital Rebel SLR and fourth Canon DSLR (the other being the 30D), and it does not disappoint.  In fact, it is an awesome camera in just about all respects in its price range.  The sensor delivers excellent results (although this will depend largely also on the lens used), the high ISO images are stunningly good for what they are, and the LCD screen is a joy to look at.  Coming from a 3\" screen with 200K pixels, it's a delight to look at the same size LCD with over a million pixels.Of course the big feature is the full-featured video mode on the T2i.  At 1/3 of the 5D Mk.2's price, it includes 720p mode that 5D Mk.2 does not, and at 1/2 price of the 7D, it has identical video mode PLUS the 640x480 crop video mode which the 7D does not, in essence providing a zoom of about 7x magnification at any given focal range.  The crop video mode works like this:  Rather than taking the whole output of the sensor and outputting that as either 1920x1080 (1080p) or 1280x720 (720p), it takes the actual 640x480 real estate at the middle of the sensor and outputs that as the capture.  So much like how the cropped sensor provides 1.6x magnification for the Canon DSLRs, the cropped video mode provides magnification for video shoots.By the way, I've been using a super-cheap $3 eBay microphone that I originally got for Skype on my laptop, and it provides loads better pickup than the built-in microphone.  It's got a flexible neck, about 5\" long, and using it also reduces the lens zoom noise, handling noise, etc.I was a bit afraid, before the purchase, how the manual focusing during video shooting would work.  While there are auto-focus methods during the shooting, they are slow and will throw the clip out of focus for 2-4 seconds.  I'm happy to say that for this absolute video-on-DSLR novice, the T2i with the 18-55 IS kit lens turned out to be fairly easy to use and achieve good results.  The IS helps a lot to reduce the invariable hand shake, unless you've got the camera mounted on a tripod.I've got one observation and two gripes, both pretty minor.  The observation is the computer resources required to handle the full 1080p video.  Each minute of the 1080p and 720p video is approx. 330MB in size.  720p produces the same size because it records at twice the framerate of the 1080p mode (60fps vs. 30fps).  Viewing the native 1080p clip straight from the camera will need fairly significant CPU power.  On my Core 2 Duo laptop with 4GB of memory, it's NOT smooth.  I'd imagine any Core i5 or Core i7 processor would be fine.  So I use a freeware called Handbrake to encode the video to h.264 mp4 format, which results in about 1/3 of the size of the original file with virtually no loss in quality.  This output plays flawlessly on my laptop.The first gripe is the dial mode.  The two modes that I will use the most, \"P\" and \"Movie\", are at opposite ends of the dial.  It takes me two or three finger actions to turn the mode back and forth.  While it's doable, it certainly would have been much more convenient if the modes were closer to each other, or if there was a separate movie mode activation button on the camera (like the 7D).The second concern is the rubber door sealing the microphone/remote/AV/HDMI ports. I like to use an external microphone for videos, so I open and close the door fairly frequently.  The rubber hinge piece seems rather fragile--only time will tell how long it will last.All in all--HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's a fantastic camera jam packed with great features.

If you have issues with the lens quality of the kit lens, it's easy to change that by using a better lens.For the average family video, which the price range of this camera is enticing, this isn't the ideal video camera.  It's tough to see the image in the LCD viewfinder in bright outdoor light, and the image does not show up in the EVF (electronic viewfinder).There is no auto focus in the video mode, and changing focus manually creates shaking in the video and mechanical noise in the audio.  The large image sensor that creates such beautiful depth of field shots also makes focusing too critical for an auto-focus system to work accurately on the fly. So give us a totally manual focus lens with footage readouts that a good photographer can develop a \"feel\" for.For film use, there is no headphone jack to monitor the audio, and the camera person can't see the image on the LCD or the EVF if they plug in an external monitor (for the director).A few inexpensive changes would make this the perfect camera.  It has stunning video and photo quality, as I mentioned earlier, at a truly affordable price.  Making the focus easier, adding XLR inputs, a headphone jack and allowing simultaneous use of the EVF, LCD and external monitor would make this the perfect camcorder.Most users may not realize the video is limited to 12 minutes per clip.  Not a problem filming short scenes, but you can't use this for filming a continuous two hour lecture. Both the T2i and T3i have a serious flaw recording video. When the sensor gets hot, the camera randomly stops. It can be a few seconds, or a few minutes, but neither can be relied upon to record video all the way to the end of the 12 minute clip limitation. Stills are not a problem.My biggest gripe with this camera is I have yet to find an SD card that is reliably fast enough to prevent the camera from stopping the recording on it's own.  The camera has an internal memory buffer that takes in the video and puts it out to the SD card.  If the SD card can't take in the video fast enough, the buffer fills up and the camera simply stops recording.  I have noticed some SD cards work better than others.  Some class 4 cards work better than some class 10's.  Sometimes I can go all day without a hitch, while other times, with the same video settings and the same SD card, it'll quit a minute into the shoot.  I do not have this problem with my Panasonic dedicated video camera, even when I use the same SD card and the same high video data rate.UPDATE:  I downloaded a third party firmware add-on that provides control over several functions not accessible by the camera's own firmware.  One of these is the ability to change the data rate of the recording.  By setting the data rate at 90 percent, I have solved the problem of the Canon T2i from freezing during recording.  The quality difference is barely perceptible, and only then if you are looking for it.  This firmware also adds audio level metering, adjusting the audio levels manually, and turning the AGC off so you don't get the hiss behind the audio track.Rick Bennette", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very easy to use, compact, and light weight", "Author": "Patricia Brouillette", "ReviewID": "R296X8WKEH1HIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was so excited about getting my new camera.

You can open the box - charge the battery and start immediately taking pictures of outstanding quality. I did that but at the same time I started to read the manual + another book on this particular camera by David D. Busch titled \"Dabid Busch's CANON EOS REBEL T2i/550D\". The one feature this camera has (can't buy a DSLR camera these days without it) I haven't used and barely tried is the HD movie capability. I am sure it will come in handy of of these days.

If a novice buys this camera they will be able to take great photos off the bat, but I would strongly suggest reading about how to take photos as there is a lot to getting the right shot. This camera does all the calculations automatically so one doesn't have to be an expert to get expert photos. That said, if you are an experienced photographer and want to do the minute calculations in regards to exposure, speed, lighting etc, then that is also available.

I initially got it before going overseas for the summer to better capture my young family's precious moments on video, as I was awed by the camera's film-like HD recording features, like 1080p at 24fps and 720p at 60fps, which could be slowed down for fluid slow-motion. This was to replace our aging Canon Optura 200 MiniDV camera, which used to do a fine job of recording standard-def videos. But then, a funny thing happened: I started taking pictures. The photos captured a level of color and detail that was light years beyond the best that our Canon Powershot SD750 ever (randomly) took. The Canon T2i introduced me to concepts like shallow depth-of-field, f-stop, shutter speed, and white balance - all things that contribute to awesome shots. The camera even re-introduced me to nature and to explore its beauty through pictures. I've developed a strange but beautiful bond I had never thought possible with a gadget. Here's to you, Canon. Thanks!P.S.: A couple caveats: Although the manual says that any SD card of Class 6 or higher is adequate for video recording, I found that the Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6 would stall on occasion, especially at 1080p 24fps and after several clips/photos, probably due to overheating. The Sandisk 8GB Extreme SDHC Card-Class 10  (SDSDX3-008G-A31), on the other hand, handles like a champ. I had maybe one similar incident. And because the Canon T2i is one of the first DSLRs to do full HD, it doesn't do continuous auto-focus or zoom while shooting video like a regular camcorder does. To shoot subjects that are moving in depth, you'll have to constantly manually focus your lens. If this bothers you - and it probably will for most - wait for newer technology to arrive soon, or get the current versions of continuous auto-focus in the Sony Alpha SLTA33L DSLR with Translucent Mirror Technology (Black) or Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome entry-level DSLR camera", "Author": "J C", "ReviewID": "RQ2M9B0062Q50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was torn between the T2i, the Nikon D3100, and the Sony a55.

The kids and grand-kids were over a few days ago, I shot over 300 pictures (mostly inside flash) and got some photos that I would challenge a professional to have done better (with a hand held camera). All were excellent quality.One important thing to be aware of, is that, the CMOS sensor in this camera is not exactly equivalent to a standard 35mm film camera in size. The end result is that it has a 1.6 multiplication factor on the 35mm lenses. The 18-55mm lens provided is about the same as a 28-88mm lens on a 35mm camera.

The T2i gives you a huge amount of bang for the buck. The 18 megapixel sensor is relatively as good as the 7D's in my opinion, and I'm saying this as a current owner of the 7D. ISO 100 files were clean, sharp, and great in the lab. Post production only made them sharper. If you held a print from this camera, a 7d, a 5D Mark II at ISO 100 I doubt seriously that any client could really tell what camera the image came from. The inclusion of a full manual video was a surprise to me, and from the samples I've seen running on my computer the videos are off incredibly excellent quality...1080p!PROS for the T2i:  * Bang for the buck - Canon gives it's users a lot in terms of features. With current pricing for the body under $800, you get a sensor that matches the quality of the 7D for most of the ISO range, and at low ISO that matches the quality of the full-frame 5D Mark II.  * Incredibly powerful movie mode - Canon went all out here. With full manual movie mode at 1080p @30fps and 24fps, Canon has shown they are absolutely serious about movie mode on an SLR. Using 5 different lenses in movie mode brought me back to why it was amazing on the 5D Mark II. I see the T2i now as a 5D Mark II movie wise with a built in teleconverter. Very nice! Also huge thank you for the microphone slot Canon. Very nice inclusion there  * New LCD - The wide screen LCD didn't require getting any used too, and looked great.  * Great ISO 100~3200 Performance - Mind you lots of cameras now are sporting high iso, but remember it was only 2 generations ago that ISO 1600 was the hard cap for the rebel series. Now pushing ISO 12800, with ISO 6400 usable in video, that's a pretty big improvement for an introductory camera. I'm personally not a fan of high iso, but if you shot a killer must get shot at iso 3200 with this camera...its easily cleanable, fixable, and usable to the extent of a big print. Just don't shoot 3200 all day long, use the high iso's with cautionCONS:  * AEB - Entry level cameras are a perfect time to promote tests with things like HDR. Canon still hasn't implemented taking three frames in AEB yet, and you can only go up or down two stops when you do. I rarely use AEB, but this has been a consistent issue for a while, when competitors (such as Nikon) have already moved forward with options to accomplish this with wider stop ranges.  * New battery system - Companies can so easily say they are improving the performance of their batteries that they have to change it, but it really feels like they are just doing this so you have to buy their extremely expensive batteries. When I sold the t1i it had 4 batteries and a grip that cost me less than $100....now I'm stuck with 1 battery for the t2i, and probably a bill of $60 just to get another one. This is pretty much a consistent complaint whenever a new battery system is out. Can wait to see how much the grip is also.Overall this camera gives you almost everything you could want in a prosumer DSLR.  It's hard to justify the extra cost of the 7D given the lack of extra features (besides the weather-sealing, 19 point AF, etc.)  With the extra money you could save, I would put that money towards from better lenses.Just my two cents, but I'll be selling my 7D in lieu of the T2i so I can finally get some L lenses.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Starter DSLR", "Author": "nako", "ReviewID": "R2YFR9MLGGGNNE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loved:-Kit lens quality much better than I expected.

The other reason I took the T2i over the D3100, which shoots at 24 or 30fps max respectively.Noted:-ISO 1600 performance is ok. Still don't like to go above 800.-Movie mode has even worse ISO performance, somehow. Can't seem to go above ISO 400 without noising everything up.-Kit aperture doesn't go wide enough. Consider a fast prime.-Stupid things missing, such as manual audio gain and live playback of audio with headphones. Magic Lantern firmware may or may not correct these in the future, which it already does with the 5D MkII. I'm not holding my breath for Canon to add these in.Hated:-Cropped frame sensor. This really screws up the lens catalog in my opinion. The great lenses are intended for full frames, so they end up having awkward equivalent focal lengths on a 1.6 crop, such as the EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM.-Movie mode audio is awful because of its automatic gain control (no manual override) and proximity to the lens. A USM lens and dedicated mic seem like the right upgrades for this.-Kit lens is a noisy beast, even when manually focusing.

Here is my review:This camera is INCREDIBLE. It is the perfect camera for almost anyone. Experienced amateurs and emerging pros will find this camera is quite the workhorse and can do most of what they'd need it to do. The photographic quality with a 50mm lens is mind-blowing, and I would highly recommend that those who will buy just the body purchase a 50mm instead of a kit lens.PROS:-HD video has frame rates of 24, 30, and 60.-ISO ranges from 100-12,800 (expanded)-Photos from ISO 100-400 look amazing, 400-800 are great.-Light and not too difficult to carry around with small lenses attached.-Auto Lighting Optimizer can make really great beach photos-I've been hired for senior portraits, weddings, and family photos using just this camera, and the results were wonderful in my customers' eyes.-LiveView is awesome, and the battery can run for about 2 to 4 hours of extended live view use (so about one senior portrait shoot could be 100% shot with LiveView and you would't run out of battery).CONS:-It really stinks at low light photography. Like, really badly. ISO 3200 and 6400 are those \"I'm only using them because a ridiculously noisy photo is better than no photo\" options that you should avoid using if you are trying to make crisp, smooth photos. If you really like grainy black and white photos, however, this is a great thing, because boy-oh-boy does it get grainy in the high ISO's.-The shutter is a bit high-pitched and noisy. Not recommended for photoshoots where it will be dead-silent and remaining unnoticed is needed. Street photographers might want to get a rangefinder camera or a higher-end Canon that has a quieter shutter.While it certainly isn't the best camera in the world, those who are true photographers and know the relationship between lenses, shutter speeds, apertures, and ISO like the back of their hand will be able to pull out some incredible works of art with this camera that could compete with much pricier Canon models.", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am so happy...", "Author": "Mr. Phil J.

Took some getting used to after using a simple point and shoot camera for years. But, once I did, I will never go back to my old camera. My photos look so much more professional now. My main reasons for getting the Canon T2i were: Full HD video at 24 fps, ability to change lenses,  and it's low-light capabilities.I wanted to really test how well this camera worked in low-light situations with my Canon 50 mm 1.4  lens on it.So, I went downtown at night and took several short video test shots with the only light being street lights, store lights, and any car headlights that went by. No camera lights - Just existing light. I was really amazed  at how bright, sharp, and clear my images came out. The T2i does a remarkable job at capturing video in low light when you have the right lens on it. My XH-A1, which is a more expensive camera, and certainly has some advantages over the T2i for video, would not have been able to do as good a job in such conditions. However, one advantage the XH-A1 has over the T2i, is that it is easier to get steady handheld video. Another disadvantage to the T2i is the LCD screen is extremely hard to see when filming in bright sunlight. I can't believe that there seems to be relatively few good options for dealing with this significant problem. Lastly, purchasing good lenses can really raise the cost of owning this relatively inexpensive DSLR. When deciding if you can afford to buy this camera, you really need to consider what accessories you may want/need to get with it to really get the most out of it for video or photos.

This camera is much like my Xsi with some very nice improvements.  First, is the 3 inch LCD.  With over one million dots, it's a thing of beauty. The first few images I made were clean and very sharp on the monitor.  To my knowledge, it's the ONLY camera with over 920,000 dots.  I did some test shots under dim room lighting indoors at ISO 6400 and found the noise unoticeable.  I'm not a video fanatic and did not try out this aspect of the camera, but the engage button is in a prominent and convenient place.  Just push it and it goes.  The menu is clear and unconfusing, easy to navigate and unnesesary for most shooting.  Like the Xsi, the camera is smallish in your hands and I found that the vertical battery grip gives you a firmer hold and is a handsome addition.  It does add some weight but you get more shots per charge with the extra battery. I looked at the Nikon D3000 and D5000 cameras and felt they looked very amateur and cheap compared to the T2i.  I think it's superior even to the more expensive 12.3 M.P. D90 too.  With 18 Mp this camera should be great at very big enlargements or even severe cropping. All in all, I'm very glad I bought it and plan on taking it on a few trips this summer.  I had been looking at bags for some time and finally settled on a Tamrac 5608.  It will house my T2i and my Xsi as well and flash and lenses and all of the other stuff that you collect.  It's a terrific camera and I can see why it sells out as quickly as it has.

The main reasons why I bought it are for the video function, the better ISO range, the better sensor, and for the compatibility with SDXC cards.As far as image quality goes, I was quite surprised of how much better it was than the XSI. I only expected a minor bump, but everything is better. There is much more clarity in the images, the color saturation is much more accurate, and the ISO sensitivity is greatly improved. Everything up to ISO 800 is good, 1600 is acceptable, and 3200 and up will need postprocessing. As far as the rest of the image quality goes, it's exactly what you would expect from a camera like this: superb. Check out the images uploaded on Amazon, and you'll see exactly what I mean.The camera is also pretty easy to use. If this is your first DSLR, you will have a few things to get used to. It is possible to use it as a point-and-shoot camera by setting everything to automatic, but you will be restraining the full potential of the camera. After I read the manual, everything was pretty straightforward. The button layout is ergonomic, and after a little practice, I had no trouble using the camera.The video function works well. Being able to shoot in 1080p is pretty awesome, but if you want this camera solely for the video function, be sure to know that everything only works properly in manual focus. It's not like a regular camcorder where someone can just point it at whatever they are videotaping. There is an automatic focus function, but it is noisy and doesn't really work well (it's hunts for focus a lot). If you are okay with manually focusing the video, then you will be amazed with the video function. After postprocessing, the video doesn't look much different than a professionally shot movie. The video is tack sharp, and the colors are breathtaking. If you use a lens with the shallow depth of field, you will have a ton of fun with the manual focusing. Just be sure to buy a fast enough memory card.So, how does it compare to the T3I? The T3I has a flip out screen, and remote flash capabilities. There are other minor differences, but those are the two big ones. If you do a lot of video, the T3I might be worth the extra money.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the camera.

That being said, I absolutely love this camera. It feels good in my hands; it's just heavy enough to give it a solid, durable feel. Other than the durable weight, though, I will say that it is a little unnerving to go to a plastic body when I had been using a metal-body point-and-shoot for a while. Though I can speak of how durable the camera feels, I cannot vouch for it in a fall (fortunately, I haven't experienced a dropped DSLR... yet).

The 18-55 lens that comes with the camera is, in terms of quality, what I expected from a kit lens. The photo quality is fine and it gets the job done, but the zoom is uninspiring.

I bought it originally when it was $850 and even then it was a steal. The ease of of the user interface is great for those who are new to photography but still want to kick out some pretty amazing photos. For those who are more experienced though do not be disappointed for the T2i has plenty of more advanced features.Physical Aspect: The camera is made out of a plastic casing with a textured rubber grip. The grip is perfect for me but I'd imagine that someone with hands a little larger than normal might have some issues. The dial for choosing shooting modes turns very nicely and sticks in place great. The layout of the buttons on the back are fantastic too. They have great response times and are easy press from shooting position. Navigation of the menu is also phenomenal. One of my favorite features is the LCD. The T2i has the highest resolution LCD out of any of Canon's DSLR's. Yep even the  $3,000+ camera's don't have a screen as nice as this. It's extremely high res and makes looking back at your shots or video on the camera not as bad as you'd think.Performance: To start this off let's just say this little bugger packs a hell of a punch. For $750 now with the 18-55mm is a must have for anyone looking for a higher end entry level DSLR. With the 18MP CMOS sensor,ISO that's actually useable at 1600, and 30fps 1080p or 60fps 720p video recording what more can you ask for? The picture and video quality of this camera is simply fascinating. The beautiful blues of a summer sky and luscious greens of grass and trees makes smile a little inside every time I take a 'Good' picture. The T2i has great image quality overall and I currently have no problems regarding it so far.

I came from Canon IS powershot, so this was definitely a big step up.  I am just getting into photography, and I thought that I'd go ahead and get the T2i over the Rebel XTi since it had a few extra features (I don't think the Rebel shoots video, MP's were lower too).  This is a good camera, but I'm not sure it was the right choice for me as I wasn't ready to step up to this level of an SLR just yet.  I have been having a hard time shooting night time photos, even after several more experienced photographers have given me tips.  They always are horribly noisy or are too dark to see anything.  I've tried all sorts of different ISO, shutter, aperture settings, and still nothing.  I have seen people take great photo's at night with these so I know it can be done, but I'll need to work on the settings a bit more.A few complaints with the camera itself, with video it does not auto focus.  That's not a horrible thing though, because the auto focus is extremely loud with just about any lens.  I went with the T2i instead of the Rebel mainly for the 1080p video.  Looking back on it I should have gotten a separate video camera instead.  The interface is also difficult to navigate, I thought it might be that I wasn't totally familiar with the layout, but I noticed a friend who had a T1i was very flustered by the controls and could not change the settings quickly or easily.Despite these drawbacks, it's a very good camera and I would easily recommend it to anyone who was looking for a good, solid DSLR camera.

It is a very good cheaper camera with lots of features and a HUGE zoom.I have the T2i and love it (the Rebel XSi didn't look too appealing to me), very good camera for size and cost. The T1i is VERY similar and the T2i is only a small step up. Look closely at the details of the T1, T2, and T3 before choosing.I also have the D60. This is the next step past the T2i. It is a little bigger, heavier, and feels more rugged than the T2i but very similar is most respects. The T3i is almost identical in features to the D60, but at that point I would go for the D60.Recommended accessories:-Tamron AF 18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Aspherical IF Macro Zoom Lens for Canon, AWESOME ALL AROUND LENS-Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens, great cheaper large aperture lens-Fotodiox Canon EOS Macro Extension Tube Set Kit for Extreme Close-up, interesting effects and cheap-Abacus24-7 Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable, HIGHLY recommended-Opteka Shutter Release Remote Control Cord, a must have for playing with long exposures-**NOTE** If you want to take HD video, you NEED a Class 10 SD card.

I found that if I was willing to learn, I could really develop my creative video skills with a DSLR on a plane that I could not reach with a video camcorder.  Enter the T2i.  Let me start by saying that this is not your father's Oldsmobile!  If you are looking for a camera you can just point and shoot, and not have to worry about exposure, keep looking.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for an incredible camera that will take mind blowing pictures, and jaw dropping video with a little study from the owners manual, this may be your camera.

This camera is also an ideal upgrade from the older rebels.Some of the key features which really stand out with this product are as follows:1. Quick startup time. (The camera powers on very quickly. There is hardly any delay from the moment you hit the power \"On\" button). The camera is also quick while shooting pictures continuously. The new image processor gets the job done in a jiffy.2. The various buttons and dials are designed ergonomically. All the buttons and dials simply fall into place. I have never experienced a moment till now where I'm left groping for a specific button / dial. There is an exception to this. for example when shooting in the \"Aperture Priority - Av\" mode, the dial next to the shutter release button is used to change the aperture. However, if you need to change the exposure compensation in the Av mode, you need to hit the \"Q\" button next to the LCD display and simultaneously use the dial next to the shutter release button. This can be a little complex to accomplish.3. The shooting modes are very easy to select. I just had some theoretical knowledge regarding the shooting modes such as Manual, Av (Aperture Priority) and Tv (Shutter Speed), prior to buying the camera. Spend a couple of hours on the day you \"un-box\" your camera, and you will be in good shape to start experimenting with the different modes.4. Excellent LCD display. The display is top notch. The clarity is simply phenomenal. The colours, saturation, tone and quality of images displayed in the \"review/preview/play\" mode is very realistic. This is confidence inspiring, and you no longer need to fret about the difference in the image displayed on the camera's LCD and the same image displayed on an LCD television. In the shooting mode, the LCD display prominently all the relevant information. The display is customized for each shooting mode, and it is very easy to understand the information. The user experience with the LCD is absolutely sensational.5. Great battery Life. This camera comes equipped with a new battery from Canon. It helps get the job done. So, the next time you decide to go on a weekend trip, you can be rest assured that the battery won't die on you. the battery typically lasts for about 400 to 500 images. These include shots taken with flash, shots of moving animals / birds in AI servo mode, repeated displays of the picture in the review mode while taking portraits and pictures of family and friends. I would recommend a buyer of this product to get an additional battery. This would take care of all your photography needs even during a week long vacation in a remote camp site with no charging facilities.6. Finally, the image quality. It is excellent. After using the camera for a couple of weeks with a combination of a wide angle lens and a zoom lens, I can confidently state that the camera is generally very good in almost any condition. Landscape shots, outdoor photography really stand out. When it comes to low light conditions, I did find the camera to be very sharp with high ISOs (upto ISO 1600). Going beyond ISO 1600 however results in some loss in clarity. However, for outdoors, indoors with decent lighting and typical daylight use, I found the camera to be phenomenal.So, if you have you are looking for a top class and an excellent value for money digital SLR, I would definitely recommend the Canon Rebel T2i.Happy Clicking !", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of my favorite things", "Author": "Carson Lawall \"C.

The camera itself is very light, it is very easy to use and very user friendly.  It has stood up to very cold temperatures and very hot temperatures in my recent world travels, and the photo quality is amazing.  I do sometimes worry about the durability because it does not have the tough housing of some of the higher end Canon models, but for the price I think it is very hard to beat.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is getting serious about their photography.One other consideration is that there are so many available lenses for Canon APS-C cameras.  Canon has a large selection and many offerings for different budgets.  There are also several offerings from Sigma and Tamron which can be very nice (the Tamron 18-270mm superzoom is very nice, inexpensive, light, and while not perfect is very versatile and fun to use for most basic travel photography).  I have a few friends with equivalent Nikon DSLR's and have found that while the image quality is about the same, lenses are a little more expensive (in rare instances a lot more expensive), and a little more difficult to find.  Really, you can't go wrong with either Nikon or Canon.  Sometimes I think choosing a DSLR becomes like joining a religion, both are great and the small differences between them seem to fit different people (or you get used to the little differences and that becomes your reference point).I thought of this camera as a stepping stone to others in the future.  I bought it to learn about DSLR's and become a better photographer, but I've been so happy with it I haven't wanted to go further.  I like to think I will eventually graduate to a more complex camera with a full size sensor, but as a fairly critical (of myself), amateur photographer, I have a lot of fun, take some pretty impressive shots, and I think for the cost it has many features that one really can't find on a similarly priced camera.

These adjustments are easy to find and the menu is quick and intuitive.  It is light weight and very easy to hold steady with only one hand.  I have no desire for video... I actually would prefer the camera without it, so I can't comment on that aspect of this Rebel.  I have also not used the live preview since my subjects are all moving constantly and it is too difficult to follow them with live preview.  I use and appreciate the great thru the camera viewfinder.I especially like having a digital camera that I can use different lenses with for different shooting needs.

This particular camera ran out of battery way too quickly with the first charge, which made me nervous, but has been perfect ever since.  Maybe the battery needed breaking in???All in all a GREAT camera for someone like me who appreciates the ability to make large prints of my shots and have people ooh and ahh when they see them.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really excellent camera; complex use", "Author": "C.

Since it is so componentized, it's almost ridiculous to give it anything less than 5 stars since you can easily upgrade any part of it to Canon's highest achievable quality. The price is great for the amount of flexibility you get and the camera feels quite durable in your hands. I've owned it for a short while and I've already begun to take many amazing photographs. The software that comes with the camera is complex and, well, *powerful*. I know that I keep using that word but \"powerful\" just describes this camera so exquisitely.If you are looking to get your feet wet in the world of amateur photography then this is definitely a camera to keep on your watch list! On the other hand, this is where my one missing star comes into play. It seems to me that the world of photographic devices could use the equivalent of a Steve Jobs to enter the market and shake the crap out of it. There is no hint of user friendliness beyond the errant dog bone here and there. Seriously.Now before every fan boy and professional photographer out there puts on his/her camouflage and personally hunts me down I want to add that I still love this camera. It's my first branch-out from a point-and-shoot and it just seems ludicrous that the learning curve between the two is basically a brick wall.

I got started in college with an old 35mm manual focus Canon and moved up to a 35mm Rebel a few years later.  I loved both of those cameras and this one follows squarely in their footsteps.  The lens compatibility with my older Rebel is fantastic and allowed me to concentrate more on the camera than a camera/lens combo (the included lens isn't bad though).One of the primary reasons I got the camera is because I wanted to take pictures of my young nieces and nephews.  They simply moved faster than the shutter wanted to close on my point and shoot digital camera.  With this, every picture is in focus and there's not blurring (unless you want to do it intentionally).  I was thrilled at my first shots. Then I discovered the continuous shooting mode.  Now I just point and press the button and it fires off several succesive frames of action and I can pick and choose which ones to keep later.The camera modes make for easy picture taking.  The full auto mode is great for when you just want some quick snaps of a family event.  The programmable mode adds a little more control while still allowing the camera to do most of the work.  But you can also shoot shutter or aperture preferred mode or go whole hog with the full manual mode.  I recently had an opportunity to test this and shooting in low light is MUCH easier with this camera compared to a non-digital as you can get instant feedback as to how your settings look.  I took some great nighttime photos at a downtown event recently and had a good time fiddling with all the features.The only small complaint I have about the camera is that if you are shooting moving people in low light, you'd better be within ten feet of them and preferably closer.  I believe the flash is rated at five meters but that wasn't my experience.  A better lens would certainly help, as would a stronger external flash so I'm not taking any stars off for it (I found similar comments to this when doing pre-purchase research) but it is something to be aware of.I've had this camera for about two months now and have shot a couple thousand pictures on it in that time.  I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase.  This camera is not without its limitations but it doesn't claim to be a professional studio camera.  It's an entry level SLR and should suit the needs of a knowledgeable amateur quite well.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera with good quality pictures", "Author": "D.

The speed and focus accuracy is amazing, and the camera functions well in fully automatic mode for novices, all the way to fully manual selections for those with more skill. All of my photos have improved drastically, and I rarely get an out of focus or motion blurred picture.I have not used the video very much, but so far I am a little disappointed.  The quality looks good when in focus, but the focus does not keep up with changing scenery, and if you manually focus, the noise is unacceptable in the video.  I'm hoping this is operator error, and it performs better with practice.I rarely give products a 5 star overall rating.

Instead, I will focus on my experience shooting video with this camera. I am a filmmaker with lots of experience shooting film and HD, and this is my first foray into DSLR video. I could not be happier! The ability to change the sensitivity of the sensor is simply an amazing experience, since it is something you cannot do when you are shooting video (other than by using the gain, but then you get lots of video noise). I can't tell you how great it is to shoot at night with available light and simply turn the knob to go all the way to 3200 ASA! (you can go higher but the noise did become and issue for me; thus buy fast lenses, f/2.0 if you can). Of course the rolling shutter problem is still there (things are recorded like jello when they move or if you pan the camera beyond a certain speed and with certain shutter speeds), but being able to use nice glass and have very shallow depth of field is great (I had to use a 35mm adaptor to get the same effect when shooting with my HVX200. I cannot overstate how important it is to get the best glass you can afford to shoot with this and any other camera; the quality of your images will be greatly affected depending on this. I have shot 1080p 24fps footage with this camera and have edited it alongside footage shot with the HVX200A, and while there is a difference in quality (in texture, and the way the cameras handle gamma) the difference is really not that noticeable. I would recommend buying the battery grip if you plan on shooting video (and extra batteries) so that you will have enough juice, especially since you will spend more time than normal making sure the image is in focus (which is also why it would be best if you buy an HD monitor to make it easier to check focus, which means you now need an external battery for the monitor, which means you also need some sort of rig to hold the monitor and your T2i at the same time...you see where Im going with this), and get class 6 SDHC cards for extra storage (I bought 3 32GB and 3 16GB class 6 cards and a Pelican case for them).  Once you start shooting with this camera you will not be able to stop. The only negative I can think of would the sound recording quality, but filmmakers usually shoot double system anyway (one device to record sound and another one to record images) so this is a non-issue for most professionals.

I want to focus on video capability of this camera. The video you get from this camera is much better than one you get from a regular or any professional video camera because of the following things:1. Control of depth of field and ability to have shallow focus.2. Bigger sensor so you can shoot in much higher ISO without noise. Noise is a big problem with most video cameras when shooting in low light.3. Manual control of shutter speed, aperture and ISO which is available only in expensive professional video cameras.Of course you have to use manual focusing when shooting video. This may be problem for many point and shooters but not for me. If you are shooting a long event this is not the camera because you can shoot 12 minutes at one stretch. Sensor gets very hot when using for a long time. Any SDHC card with class 6 designation works fine for video. Buying class 10 is overkill. I use Patriot Class 6 SDHC card.It's lightweight (which I love) but does not feel cheap. Good ergonomics but may feel small if you have a large hand. Some people say adding a battery grip solves this problem but it gets heavier and takes more space in your camera bag. I use Tenba Laptop messenger bag (small) with this camera and works great. I can fit laptop, camera, lenses, flash and other accessories, note pad etc. It's hard to fit laptop if I use the battery grip with the camera. So if you are trying to save space don't buy battery grip.

I don't know much about a lot of the technology yet, but I'm learning a lot. After doing a ton of research, I decided to go with the T2i, because mainly, I wanted shallow depth-of-field in everything I shot. I used a bunch of camcorders over the years, none of which gave me the depth-of-field I wanted... everything was in focus and it looked so amateur. Not the case with this camera.Take a look at popular video sites, and just do a search for Canon t2i footage or anything remotely close to that.

I recommend a screen protector to keep it pristine. I always go with Zagg InvisibleShields for any device I get. + The noise levels in photos even at high ISO is extremely impressive. +  Live View even in Full Auto mode + Uses SD, SDHC, SDXC cards.

I expected to stay with that camera because it took excellent photos, allowed me to shoot videos for YouTube, permitted continuous shooting, and grouped for HDR processing--without having the expense of a SLR and lenses or the weight that comes with them.  However, because I found that I like to shoot sports, I was frustrated with the 1 photo per second burst and wanted to try my hand with HD video.I bought the camera from Amazon as part of a package that included the 18-55 kit lens and the 55-250 zoom. I was satisfied with the photos I was getting before, but I know now I was too easily satisfied; the photos that I get now are superior, not a big difference, but noticeable.Several days ago I attended the pre-season game of the Patriots and Rams and shot a 1000 photos at almost 4 frames a second, insuring that I was much more likely to capture the key moments of action.The stadium was very well lighted, but even so for most of the game the ISO selected by the camera was 1600 (I chose the shutter speed and automatic white balance, the camera chose the rest), but when I checked the photos with Noise Ninja, there was no more noise than I would have gotten on a sunny day with my previous camera.  The T2i includes a noise repression control with the settings, high, standard, and low.  I have the camera set at \"standard\" and kept it there because I read that using the \"high\" setting slows the camera in the burst mode, but based on my experience the other night, standard is fine for most occasions.  I suppose if I was shooting in low light I might want to switch to high, but I would not likely be in the burst mode in those conditions.I ordered a battery pack before getting the camera because I'd read many reviews saying this was needed because of the small size and low weight of the camera.  Because I found the camera comfortable in my hands and I had no trouble holding it steady, I thought I had made an unnecessary purchase.  But I installed the battery pack and plan to continue using because I do think it is of benefit and, if nothing else, make it easier for me to shoot video.  When shooting video with this camera you can't use the view finder, as I could with previous camera, but must hold the camera in front of your face and see what you are shooting on the screen.  I believe the extra size and weight with the battery pack will be of help.I should also mention that the camera manual says you should use at least a Class 6 card when shooting video.  It should also say to use at least a Class 6 card when continuous shooting.  Before the Class 6 and 10 cards came, I did some continuous shooting using the Class 4 cards that served me well with the previous camera.  The photos using the Class 6 and 10 cards are superior.  With the class 4 I got some usable photos from a burst, with the class 6 and 10 cards all are potential keepers, and any problems are attributable to other factors.The only \"down side\" is now I am starting to yearn for a faster zoom lens.  The 55-250 did an adequate job the other night, but I know that I could have done better with a faster (and more expensive) lens.

First off, I'm half asleep and not a pro so take what you can get. sorry. The Canon lens' while I had to switch them constantly and many times ened up missing the shot that I wanted in the time that it took to switch the lens over, even though I am dextrous as hell I must say lol. But when using the canons the images always came out sharp and colors where more vibrant in some (especially lowlight scenes) than when using the Tamron. The Tamron is workable in lowlight but I was pretty much having to use manual focus which isn't always easy to see clearly through the lcd. The body on the camera is just a winner in every way. It needs to win awards in many catagories. The quality that this thing is able to take is really second to none in it's price range. Then you can have 1080p  video for a couple of minutes until the camera heats up and shuts itself down. That's always fun. What is with it overheating?The SD780 can shoot in 720p without overheating for much longer yet it's much smaller in size. The movie quality is excellent no doubt. The time limit on the movies it what turns it into almost useless.  Ok, sorry for rambling, so basically the Tamron technically does what I had hope the two Canon's would do without having to change lenses. But autofocus fails in lowlight situations, and purple fringe can be seen in some low light pictures as well. Most of the bright came out as good or almost as good as the canons. I now feel like I wish I hadn't spent all the money on the Tamron when the Canons actually take the better pictures every single time without worry. Just awesome pictures.Hope this helps someone save some money or at least get an idea on which way they may want to go with a lens.Either way have fun. oh by the way, the macro on the Canon 15-55mm was closer and much crisper and more vivid on the flower that I took.

On the good side the camera is lightweight and the ergonomics are great with a great menu system, great LCD,comfortable feel and quick access controls.

The files are HUGE--large JPEGS are over 6 MB each. RAW's are about 21 MB each.  So it does not take much to shoot 2 Gigs' worth of photos. That means that if you buy the camera, you'd better get a large SD card.2. Although I like having the 1600/3200 (and up) ISO's--and the pictures shot in 3200 ISO look decent--better than those shot in 1600 ISO with the XT, I am not terribly wowed by the quality. Yes, I get decent pictures in situations where I would otherwise must use a flash, the pictures are still very grainy and can't be sharpened easily for some reason.3. The expanded range for exposure compensation--5 steps each direction (versus 2 on the XT)--is definitely a big plus.4. I really appreciate having the extra convenience buttons (for changing the ISO or the other functions), but that may be because I have been using the XT for too long.5. The camera uses up a lot of battery power. I was surprised by how quickly the battery meter went from half (two bars left) to nothing. A backup battery, which just showed up on Amazon, costs $80+. No small change. Perhaps the price may come down eventually, but perhaps not. So what was just an inconvenience--the display cannot be set to be \"OFF\" by default--is just plain annoying. Yes, you can turn the display off with the push of a button, but you have to do it each time you turn on the camera.*6 The one big drawback for me is that Canon's Zoombrowser, the most recent update, no longer opens up the RAW files. Sure, I can use the Digital Photo Professional, which comes with the camera, but the nifty \"adjust and then batch process\" is not in the DDP. (I can batch process, but can't gather all the files for batch processing, adjust individual files on the fly and THEN execute the batch processing command--which means that I either batch process the RAW files as they were shot, then adjust EACH JPEG afterwards, or tweak the RAW files by opening EACH individually .) In any case, in the past, I have always converted the RAW files using Canon software and then tweak JPEG files in Photoshop. The RAW editing feature in Zoombrowser was very convenient.

I had been using the Canon Rebel XT, which is a good DSLR, but the T2i is a fantastic step up. As with any DSLR, the lenses are more important than the actual body of the camera, but the T2i is a great foundation to build on.Here are some of my favorite features.- 18MP resolution. My XT has a rather pitiful resolution of 8MP. Though with 8MP you can make great 4x6 prints, in the age of the computer, images should have a high enough resolution that they do not appear grainy on a large computer screen. The T2i's 18MP creates beautifully detailed photos even on a large digital screen.- SD card slot. SD cards are easy to come by, and with two or three 8gb SD cards on hand, even with 18MP images you are not likely to run out of space. If you're shooting weddings, you may want to stock up.- Remote compatable. The T2i does not come with a remote, but I ordered one for less than two dollars off of Amazon, and it's as easy as pointing the remote at the camera and clicking the button. This feature is very handy for taking self-portraits.- Large (3\") LCD screen. The bigger your screen, the easier it is in review to pick out images less than tack-sharp.- Sport setting. This setting enables you to take clear action shots without blur or any noticable shutter delay. If you hold down the shutter button, continuous shooting automatically kicks in, re-focusing about every second.- Brilliant layout. The info on the LCD screen while you are shooting is very easy to understand.

I had a XTI before this and now use a 7D now as my primary body.  My T2i is now my back up.  I shoot street, indoor sports, and portraits primarily. I would consider myself semipro at this point.  Not full time yet, maybe one day.Thoughts...This is a great camera for those who want to learn how to shoot a DSLR.  I believe this is a DSLR built for shooting stills primarily while having video capabilities. It is not a replacement for a video camera.  The ISO capabilities are comparable to the newer models.  Anything past 6400 on any rebel really is hard to use anyway.  If you are learning to use a DSLR, and you learn to use this one to its maximum potential, you will be ready to move on to a Pro or Prosumer DSLR.  This camera really does have all the capabilities to teach what DSLRs can do vs camera phones or whatever.  18mp is more than enough to create large images while still allowing you enough MP to crop and learn what framing things properly does for your photography.  Not that you want to do that.(Get as much right in the shot as possible)  None of this really matters if you don't learn the science behind the great composition.Use..I have used this for everything.  I originally purchased it because I believed it would help me take better photos of my sister's wedding. I essentially had some gear lust(term used because you just want the latest and greatest gear).  So very wrong as all photographers will tell you.  I had ideas of what I wanted things to look like, but had no clue how to create and was hoping that the camera was going to do the work for me.It was on toted around for a while.  Took pictures on full auto(the green setting and 1 in 3000ish shots would be what I saw or more important, what I wanted to capture.  I had a friend who just started guiding me to websites, blogs, going shooting with me and I really have become better since then.  Since I learned how to use every part of my camera(not full auto), I learned how awesome this camera is.  The only thing about the camera that I would have liked from it would faster frames per second, however it only really would have helped with is indoor sports shooting.  Even so, I got the 50mm 1.8 and found that the lens was a decisive  difference.  I found that I couldn't do much of what I wanted with the lens that came with the camera.  Even with the image stabilizer.  Once I learned how to use the 50mm 1.8, I bought and learned the 85 1.8.  The camera body itself is perfect to learn all the basics and then some that will be able to lead into the 7D, 5D, etc...ConclusionI want to tell anyone who is looking at buying the t4i or the t5i or even something more expensive without prior experience, is you should purchase something less expensive and see if you really like photography.  Buy something less expensive like a used t2i or even an old film camera and a 50mm 1.8.  Then dive into all the great FREE internet material about the craft of photography.  Finally go shoot to practice things. Learn what the exposure triangle is.(Iso, Shutter, Aperture)  Specific things like how to create Bokeh(Background Blur)to isolate what your trying to shoot, or long exposure(keeping the shutter open for a while.  Once you do that, there will be reasons why to buy this camera or others.  You will learn lenses are a key part to the the capabilities of Shooting, no more than your knowledge of how to used the tools to get that shot you want. This is a very capable camera to get you started and keep you going.  I still use it as my back up camera on my shoots.  The images are just as good as my 7D.  I'm going to stop typing and say just go shoot.  Shoot with purpose and an open mind to learn this implement of art.  Get out and shoot.  Please feel free to ask questions.

I bought a used Rebel T2i for $400 a month ago because it has newer technology. Here is my comparison.The 40D is a higher grade camera with magnesium body, better shutter feel and sound. It's heavier and gives me a substantial feel. Unfortunately the 40D's low light performance is so so. Don't push any ISO beyond 1600. The T2i's overall deisgn is more plasticky. The shutter's feel and sound are also inferior to the 40D. But it has 18 meggapixels. I can push the ISO to 3200 with fairly good result. I put a high priority on ISO because I always use existing lighting as much as posible except for those typical non-creative social photos. Otherwise I would have no problem buying back the 40D.You won't go wrong buying a used 40D or a T2i. The 40D is well built and feels solid to the hand. Ten meg is more than enough. You can always use RAW to achieve bigger file size. The T2i is like a Honda, not an Acura but it gives you bigger file and video. Used prices for 40D or T2i are similar, for about $400. You can't even buy a Sony Nex 3 for that amount.If you are about to get more involved in photography, don't care much about video (I don't) and want to upgrade from a point and shoot, buy a used 40D. I still miss my 40D. If you must have video and won't mind plastic body, buy the T2i. Remember, the camera can only be as good as the photographer.

I want the camera to always bracket the exposure, -1, then normal, then +1. I set this up using the bracketing feature but every time the camera is shut off it 'forgets' this setting and all others. I have to set up the bracketing every singe time. So frustrating.Another problem is the focusing. When I select only the center focus zone, it does NOT focus on what is exactly in the center of the frame (beneath the glowing dot) Rather it focuses on the center AREA of the frame, for example on the background behind the face in the center of the screen. This leads to many missed shots. There seems to be no way to force the camera to focus exactly on a point, only on an area (and rather large one) of the field of view. As a workaround I leave all zones active and refocus over and over until the dot above my subject indicates that zone is focused. Works most the time.Thirdly, Canon chose external rotation for their standard 18-55 lens. This means the outer barrel rotates as the lens focuses. This makes using a circular polarizer very frustrating; it has to be reset every time the lens refocuses.Update: more comments:Great camera overall, My choice was this or the comparable Nikon and I went with Canon based on the menu format (picture quality seems about the same). Well, after using it heavily for a couple years I must comment on what I consider some software flaws. For example, one which other reviewers can evidently live with, but annoys the HECK out of me- when switched off the camera forgets all the customized setup steps previously entered. For example, say you want to set a bracketed exposure, three shots at -1stop, 0, +1stop. Setting this up takes several clicks and wheel rotations. But when the camera is powered off then on again, that setup and all others are forgotten. The bracket then needs to be set up all over again, and again, and again, and again. I suppose this could be considered a 'feature' in that the camera 'resets itself'. But then at least provide one 'user setting' which DOES keep all customization.Hopefully Canon will add/fix this with a software upgrade so the camera can simply remember the user's preferred settings.There are other small annoyances like the flash popping up in broad daylight and in other totally inappropriate lighting conditions, and a focus issue wherein camera literally refuses to take a shot when the focus can not be set perfectly. I would much rather it just take its best guess and shoot instead of indefinitely trying to get it perfect.. It's like a scene from top gun or something with me furiously thinking 'TAKE THE SHOT TAKE THE SHOT!' but the camera just will not fire the shutter. Sooo frustrating..There are others as well; but you get the idea. Great camera hardware potential, in need of better software. These are all software issues which could be solved in a firmware upgrade.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "SUCH a good camera.

The Canon system has tons of inexpensive, vet BRILLIANT lenses. If you decide to pick up the T2i, I HIGHLY recommend the EF 50mm 1.8 as well (I may post a full review on that in the future).But enough about the Canon system, let's talk about this DSLR itself. It's 18MP, significantly more than enough for all but the most professional user. The huge resolution gives you plenty of room to edit and crop to your heart's desire. The photos are crisp and clear, and there are no major issues in the automatic mode that aren't fixable in simple software like iPhoto. There's also a large myriad of custom settings- and you're really missing out if you don't at least try some of the manual modes.

The camera is extremely user friendly- you can just pick it up and go.If you're looking for a entry level DSLR that doesn't feel cheap and plastic-y like the less expensive Canon T3 or XS, I completely recommend the T2i.

Canon managed to create a lens mount system 25 years ago that would allow for advancement in the body and lens components. That being said, the system works.  I have owned numerous film Canon bodies, dozens of lenses and at least four digital bodies.  Sometimes I buy the middle price unit and sometimes I buy the lowest price unit.  The T2i is a very good camera that has many fine capabilities.  The pictures have been consistently good with the kit lens, a 50mm f 2.5 macro and the Canon 15-85 zoom lens.  The lens you select will determine the quality of the picture. if I had it to do again I would not get the kit lens.  I would opt for a Tamron 17-50 f2.8 for around $500 or the Canon 15-85 for around $700.  I have used those lenses and the improvement over the kit lens is huge.  I am especially pleased with the size and weight of the camera...it is among the smallest and lightest weight.  I shoot mainly in aperture preferred for close-up and HDR photography. I have owned the camers for more than six months and I use it every day.  It is a champ.  There are a lot of professional reviews of this camera and thousands of happy customers.  One more thing that is important to mention.  Canon supplies a lot of handy software with their cameras including tethering for studio use. Some of the other camera maker's charge for this type of program.

The T2i is an awesome camera, but video takes up MASSIVE amounts of memory and unless you plan to use the video mode on a very regular basis, there's no need to upgrade from another Canon DSLR. I wanted the video so I could get shots of my baby nephew doing funny things and email the files to relatives, but as large as the files are, they won't even attach to an email. Uploading the video to share sites hogs up a lot of storage space, so that's not the greatest option, either. As a result, I probably won't use the video mode as much as I thought I would. In regards to T2i, there are minor improvements from the Xsi, but I think they've all been discussed in these reviews so I won't reiterate. I'm very happy with this camera, but in all honesty it wasn't necessary for me to get it since I had a perfectly good Xsi that doesn't differ a whole lot from T2i.

Adding a battery grip solved the size/grip issues immediately.The 18MP sensor (17.9 actual in file resolution) produces images at the same quality as the 60D and 7D camera bodies.  The only issue is the ISO availabilities, with this maxing out at 6400.  However, I doubt I will be shooting in super high ISO due to image noise, and made a point of fitting images with image stabilization (gyroscopic) which allows for longer shutter times and therefore the ability to get a good shot on a lower ISO.I could go over this in a full review, but it isn't necessary.  The camera rocks.Only 2 cons, both of which have an easy solution:1) Out of the box, the camera's remote port for a wired shutter switch did not work with my Opteka switch.  Expecting that I got a bad switch, I went out and bought the Canon RS-60E3 switch, and it also didn't work.  I reloaded the camera's firmware, no joy.  I then went out and downloaded a fresh copy from the Canon website, extracted it, and loaded it, and now both switches work.  So, if you end up with this issue, download a fresh copy FROM CANON and it seems to be the solution.2) Audio tends to shift quite a bit, with the camera running an automatic gain, which leaves you with garbage (hiss) in recorded audio.  This is one feature that the higher end offers, the ability to disable the gain, but the T2i (as well as T1i and T3i) firmware sets do not allow this.  Adding the Magical Lantern firmware enhancement (search Google) adds an additional programming menu from the SD card where it is installed, and allows 7D-level control of audio.

There is almost no visible difference between using the famed f1.8 50mm and the 18-55 kit lens in terms of clarity and sharpness.  Auto focus is fast and accurate, especially when set on center-point priority.  The Image Stability technology is genuinely useful and effective.Just for fun I have shot numerous images of the moon using a Sigma 70-300mm lens (non-IS).  These images are very sharp and fun to display.  Better yet, there is little noticeable noise in the jet-black night sky field behind the moon.  Excellent low light technology.  ISO is adjustable from 100 to 6400.For those who like point and shoot simplicity, this camera will do that on full auto mode.  Of course, I cannot stand full auto and routinely shoot in full manual.  This camera makes it easy to cheat, however, and I often click it back over to program mode and am usually pleased at the final results.Battery life is quite good, easily taking me through a 2 hour continuous shoot of 400 images (I do not use the onboard popup flash at all).  A 16gb SDHC class 10 card seems ideal for my needs (I shoot full quality jpg and raw simultaneously).The viewfinder is quite bright.  Similarly the LCD display is excellent for readability, even for someone who normally uses reading glasses, like myself.  Its built-in selectable diopitors readily dial in a crystal clear viewing experience through the lens, even without my reading glasses (I much prefer to shoot without glasses on).  Canon, please never get rid of the built-in diopitors on your viewfinder.One of the camera's best features is the quick view and set menu display.

It makes the lenses bigger, more expensive and with bigger distortion.Well, this camera has a 1.6 crop factor, therefore a prime lens of 50mm will be a half-tele (80mm equivalent).If you want to buy lenses with wider than that, there are a few lenses designed to the EF-S standard, that takes advantage of the small size of the mirror of this camera (small mirror because the sensor is small) and it brings the lens closer to the sensor, using an optimized design. These lenses do not fit the full frame cameras, that have a bigger mirror.For lenses with bigger focus distance this isn't usually an issue, so it doesn't matter. But try to find what Canon offers on choices of normal or wide-angle lenses designed to the EF-S standard, there are very few options and none of them is a prime lens non-zoom normal or wide angle lens.Options are mainly:EF-S 10-22mm 3.5-4.5 USM, \u00d877 (16-35mm equiv) for US$720,EF-S 17-85mm 4-5.6 IS USM, \u00d867 (27-136mm equivalent USM) for US$510, this is an upgrade to the original lens that is not a bad one, by the way.EF-S 17-55 2.8 IS USM, \u00d877 for US$1.000,So for wide angle options there a few remaining and no prime lens designed to the EF-S standard. It seems to be cheaper to purchase a Sony Alpha Nex or a Four Thirds Micro camera if you need good wide angle lens for a reasonable price.

These things are very minor, and can definitely be gotten with a higher quality camera in the Rebel series.

(although, to her chagrin, I could care less about what I wear.)  After buying this camera, I noticed I have a fairly consistant habit of getting a new SLR every 4 years--I bought the 10D, the 40D and now, the T2i.  I considered the 7D and the 5D Mark-II but the cost has always been just a bit high--and I missed the sale on the 5D so I took it as a sign not to spend that much cash on a new camera.  Going from just what I know from the 10 and 40, this camera is quite amazing.  Very well made, takes awesome photos (you'll need fast SD cards though...) and is super lightweight compared to my older D cameras.  The downside to the light weight build of the T2i is, if you own some L lenses, this will make the camera feel a bit odd.  I don't think I'll be going out with my 24-70L or the 24-105 attached to it--the balance is just too far gone.  Final downside is Canon dropped support of their old batteries--for years they used the same pack from the D30 to the 40D--then they changed for the Mark II 5D and everything else that followed it.  It was one of the best bright sides to owning both the 10D and 40D--I could pull from the same source of battery packs.However, with a prime or a 17-40L, this is a jewel of a camera.  Plus, by selling the kit lens, it's not that much more than a very good point and shoot.  Tired of lugging around that boat anchor of a 5D II?

After much debate, I ended up returning the T2i for my own personal reasons. Keep in mind, every camera has pros and cons, and the best camera for you is the one you use in your hands. The T2i is still a 5-star (excellent) camera.1) AF and 3D trackingT2i: Does not beep nor show light indicators while it tracks movement.K-x: No focus indicators at all (except during phase-detect live-view), but fast AF with beeps.2) Low-Light assist beamT2i: Fail. Does strobe-like, seizure-inducing effect with the pop-up flash.K-x: Fail. Ditto.3) FlashT2i: Attempts to default to ISO400. Powerful.K-x: Fail. Weaker and not as elevated above camera.4) External FlashT2i: Has a good small flash (270EX) that uses 2 AA batteries. Cycles fast n quiet, lightweight high sync above 1/180. Can adjust exposure in-camera.K-x: Ok options. Little outdated. Only larger, regular-sized external flashes. But camera has built-in wireless flash control = Nice.5) Live ViewT2i: Good AF speed. Does not show histogram. Keeps mirror open when changing modes or playback.K-x: Contrast AF speed sucks. Phase-detect is much faster. Mirror is noisy.6) Color AccuracyT2i: Reds look good in JPG.K-x: Deep reds look magenta in JPG using default settings. Blue skies are vivid.7) NoiseT2i: JPG has better algorithm. Keeps more detail. More noise in shadow areas.K-x: RAW files has excellent performance. JPG engine too harsh.8) FocusT2i: Shows focus points, sensitive to color of light.K-x: Must resort to center focus and recompose shooting style. Can use manual lenses with cheap vintage glass.9) White BalanceT2i: Fail indoors. Would have to use flash. Custom white balance is a pain.K-x: Good Auto. Custom white balance is easy to use too.10) Battery LifeT2i: Has proximity sensors to turn off LCD. Li-ion about 400 shots. Can accomodate battery grip.K-x: Easy to find AA batteries. No battery grip. Up to 800 shots with manual lens. Eneloop FTW.11) Viewfinder InfoT2i: Shows buffer and exposure.K-x: More readable F number and shows custom modes12) Instant ReplayT2i: Must press Play button before zooming in, does not show blinking exposed areas or ISOK-x: Good. Can custom zoom quickly, but to see ISO must press INFO button13) BodyT2i: A little bigger, very light and plasticy.K-x: Compact, more sturdy and heavier.14) MeteringT2i: Features Active D+ lighting which protects highlights well or ALO for shadow.K-x: Has highlight and shadow optimzing, athough more subtle, both can be turned on simultaneously.15) Dynamic RangeT2i: About average for JPG and RAW. Confirm withed ImageResourceK-x: JPG sucks but RAW is top 5 superb.16) Image correctionT2i: Corrects vignetting, does not slow down bufferK-x: Corrects distortion and/or CA but slows down buffer a lot17) Shadow NoiseT2i: JPG are malleable, comparable to RAW files. More chroma noise present, but NR gives better results.K-x: JPG best without NR applied. RAW files less chroma. NR too harsh.18) FeaturesT2i: 18mp sensor and metering from 7D. Great modern lens ecosystem.K-x: Intervalometer, HDR, more presets such as Extract color, wireless flash, in-camera RAW processing. Compatibility with all Pentax bayonet vintage glass during film era.BOTTOM LINE:T2i: No worries camera. Not very customizable though. The \"reliable\" camera.K-x: Capable of better results with work.

I came back to SLR cameras after twenty years, and I am ecstatic about what this offers....go for it.However if I want to be critical I would mention the following issues:In Liveview mode (shooting pictures while using the screen at the back, not the viewfinder) the autofocus changes mode and it becomes very slow and erratic. In fact it behaves like my first generation autofocus SRL from the late eighties. I believe this could be solved in a better way and surely future generations of this camera will deal with this. So, if you are used to shoot via the screen and you come from a decent compact camera, you might be slightly annoyed. (focus through viewfinder is flawless, though).One more note if you are considering to use this camera as camcorder. I believe this camera cannot replace a camcorder, simple because the image stabilisation is not on the same level with good quality camcorders, and depending on the lens you might not have image stab at all, plus your depth of field can be quite small, which makes for nice looks, but often out of focus videos if you are not careful. (you cannot and should not use continuous autofocus in video mode because the focussing noise is recorded). So, great video quality if you are after high quality, artsy or \"proper\" videos. If you are after a simple to use video camera this it is not.

To respond to the previous review comparing T2i with 60D,60D has some extra features such as swivel LCD, faster fps, a 2nd screen on top. but 60D and T2i have the same 18 MP CMOS sensor, DIGIC 4 processor, same metering system (63 zones), same 9 point (but 60D has all cross type vs. 1 in T2i)focus system. So picture quality, high ISO noise performance are essentially the same. all the reviews such as dpreview.com, the-digital-picture.com say that. I would get the 60D if it had Magnesium alloy case (as in the 50D), but otherwise picture quality is essentially the same. So you can decide if those extra features listed on top worth $300 (difference in body only price). or you can use $300 toward the prime lens 50mm f1.4 whose optical quality is on par with L lenses.If you shoot sports, you may consider the 7D which has much higher fps: 8 vs. 3.7, much faster focus system: 19 points (all cross type) vs. 9 points (only 1 cross type). Faster focus system helps you track moving subjects in sports easier using AI SERVO focus mode. In fact if you plan to upgrade to a full frame with the 5D mark II, wait for the incorporation of this Focus system from the 7D to the 5D mark III ( I can't wait for it to come out).the 7D also has weather sealed magnesium alloy case. So if you get a weather sealed L lens with 7D, you can shoot in dusty, rainy environment. it also has 100% viewfinder and uses pentaprism (instead of pentamirror) for brighter viewfinder. It has the same sensor but with dual Digic 4 processor (vs. single in 60D, T2i) so it processes picture faster. But picture quality is essentially the same among these 3 cameras and should not be the reason to get the more expensive version. I think if you don't need those extra features, use the extra fund to upgrade the lenses such as 17-55mm f2.8 IS, 50mm f1.4 (totally worth it for me)", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon T2i", "Author": "Norman Desrosiers", "ReviewID": "R34XUUS502C8KP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product turned out to be everything we were looking for.

I shot with a Canon G9 for two years and was very happy with most pictures.  Shutter delay was an issue.  With the Canon T2i, the standard 18-55mm lens, the 55-250mm zoom, and the addition of a 60mm macro lens (reviewed else where) I feel I have a system that will meet my photo needs well into the future.  Shutter delay is almost eliminated and even though I hate to admit it the larger sensor of the DSLR does result in a much cleaner image file making photo editing a breeze.  Edge to edge sharpness and less noise in almost every image.  Another advantage of the larger sensor is much better image quality in the higher ISO ranges.  There is a very noticeable improvement in image quality for those shots you take in dim light, at dusk, or dawn.  As for ease of use, there are multiple automatic settings that will allow use of the camera as an advanced point-and-shoot.  It is almost impossible to take a bad exposure in the automatic modes.  The built in flash is adequate for many indoor lighting needs although many will want to upgrade and the ability to go full manual will unleash all your creative talents.  My one and only negative is the lack of metal construction but the use of modern resin materials also reduces the overall weight of the camera so it has a very good balanced feel.

As for the video, I'd say there are real issues.  The video quality is fine, but there is no continuous auto-focus, so you have to keep half-pressing the shutter, and I found the auto-focus in video mode to be pretty slow.

It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't \"feel cheap\" in my opinion. It features a 3-inch LCD (compared to the Rebel XS's 2.5 inch screen), which also has a very high resolution. It looks lovely! Auto-focus is fast, and I've been very pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos I've taken so far.Video capture was decent. It is full 1080, and even though it can do 30p, I think 24p is better. Like many video cameras, the video capture is not so good in lower light (where flash would be used for a still).The T2I has a very well designed interface. Its roots may have started in the 'starter camera' level, but its also has a full compliment of modes for those who understand how and why shutter speed, aperture, and exposure influence the final image. For a traditionalist such as myself the only limitation (if I might call it that) is in learning to become as quick and intuitive controlling those factors as I became over the years with a shutter speed dial, an aperture ring, and a traditional meter readout.LCD Screen: Awesome. One of the best LCD's I have seen in DSLR's, prosumers, point and shoot, and mobile phones. Agreed in bright daylight, we are going to have challenges. However, it is the best LCD screen I have seen and one should be able to gauge the picture review even in bright daylight. Any other place, like indoors, overcast sky, etc ... the screen just amazes me with its clarity, and crispness.Photographically I am impressed and pleased.

The T1i had some problems with the microphone position and recording good quality sound for your videos.  However, the new placement of the microphone on the T2i is much better and it seems the problem of the sound has been taken care of.At this price point, you will be hard pressed to find a better camera.The quality of the kit lens can be improved.

I haven't had that time yet. But initial impressions based on some test shooting and careful study of features, function, controls, and documentation are extremely positive. This is an upgrade from a Canon Rebel XT, so a great deal about the features/functions is new, but diving into each of them show that it's all very well thought out, not too hard to learn/use, and exceptionally well documented. The degrees of gradation between completely automatic and completely manual are practically limitless. Innovative features like \"picture style\" and \"auto lighting optimizer\" will delight some and make others wary. I tend to be wary but in ordinary situations they work nicely and are easy to disable. The 550D's \"quick control\" panel is great and provides a much faster and more intuitive way to access and change most of the settings that are most likely to need changing. The Quick Control view also makes it easy to turn off \"picture style\" and \"auto lighting optimizer, if need be. The unit \"feels\" better-built than the Rebel XT and the controls are laid out in better way. The LCD is superb, sharp, and the 1:1.5 proportion is an improvement.

I decided to buy my own out of pure camera lust. It was one of the best purchases I have ever made. I love this camera. When the right settings are employed even the stock lens can create incredible images. The most important feature, the reason which I bought this camera, is it's video capabilities, which are incredible. Our company also owns a Canon XHG1, an 8000 dollar professional mini-dv camcorder, and it is my professional opinion that this camera (T2i), when the right lenses and setting are employed and taken advantage of, produces vastly superior video. You can buy this camera and 3 or 4 nice L glass lenses for the price of the XHG1 and be a far more capable videographer. I am almost certain there are better uses of the 8000 dollars it takes to buy a XHG1 that will produce some marginally better video quality, however, I believe the T2i to be the most versatile and cost effective in its price range and form factor and along with the inexpensive accessories you can buy for it you have yourself a formidable video camera setup in the pro-sumer, and some would argue even the professional market. Some other good things about this camera are the all manual controls, the selection of 1080P 30fps and 1080P 24fps, both having their merit, and 720P 60fps. The screen is top notch for its competitors and the way the setting are laid out are among the best in the Rebel line, to my experience. I believe this camera to be a very good choice for an aspiring film maker because of its versatility and price point and it is also a good camera for the aspiring photographer because it is a camera you can grow with. 10/10.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera - find better deal elsewhere", "Author": "G.

I am more of a video person, so i will be focusing on that part of the camera.  with the 18-55 mm lens provided it has very little white noise, however with the 55-250 mm i got with it, it has alot more white noise (i dont know if its the lens or the camera), however since it has a mic input, that can all be rectified (havent used the mic input yet tho).  The video quality itself is pretty good.  compared to my handman cam, the hd video is far better, and changing the exposure and white balance is easy, however when changing the exposure, it makes a bit too much noise and it is noticeable in the recorded video.  focusing while in video is relatively easy and can make for some interesting videos.  taking a picutre while taking a video however freezes the video for a second and is very noticeable, it almost seems like a frame rate issue when watching the recorded video later.overall, i am really happy with the money i spent for this camera (at retail price, it wasn't a sale).  for the price, it is the best hdslr camera out there, however not the best camcorder.  I am in a field that I have to do both, so it was a great deal for me, but for a person that just wants a camcorder, adjusting the features of this camera while recording is a bit inconvenient for videos, not to mention it is in the body of a camera, so naturally a camcorder's body is better fit for the job.  again its a great combination of the two tho.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall Good", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RIWSGVBO6TYI5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm an Olympus user but needed a camera with a faster auto-focus and video-capabilities.

I don't know if it was a mistake, but the combo I got came in an official Canon box that looks like the one above except 50% wider. In this official Canon box it contained the retail Canon box for the T2i+18-135mm, the retail Canon box for the lens hood for the 18-135mm lens, the retail Canon plastic container for the filter for the 18-135mm lens, and the retail Canon battery for the T2i.I have no idea why it is not mentioned in the product information on Amazon. That's why I'm wondering if maybe it was a different combo that I got, however I was unable to find that exact Canon Combo on Amazon. When I went to Best Buy they only had the T2i with 18-55mm lens and the T2i with 18-135mm lens. So I guess it may be a gamble as to whether you get the super combo with the camera, lens, lens filter, lens hood, and extra battery or if you get just the camera and lens. In the former case, it's an amazing deal. In the latter case, I agree with the reviewer \"skintigh\" that its better to get the T2i + 18-55mm lens AND then separably purchase the 18-135mm lens because (at the time of writing this) they cost $849 and $388 respectively, then you can easily sell the 18-55mm lens for $100 (retails on amazon for $169 at the time of writing this). However, with the official Canon battery, lens filter, and lens hood, it's a different story.I'd be interested to hear comments from other reviewers to see what combo they got...As for reviewing the camera itself: everyone else pretty much covered everything. I absolutely love this camera and it takes great shots with excellent quality for the money. What really sold me is the fact that it can record Full HD video (which looks amazingly good, especially with my canon 50mm f1.4 prime lens). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because during video recording, one has to focus manually. Although the camera continuously adjust exposure, it does not have a continuous focus mechanism like a dedicated video camera... this is the last hurdle to truly having a great cross-over product.

If you are earning a living in photography you already have a metal body, water resistant camera and won't need to read this. If however, you are a weekend shooter like myself, looking to buy a top tier feature laden DSLR, and have narrowed your choice to a T2I, T3I, 60D or 7D, build quality should be a non issue. The polycarbonate used in the T2I is probably almost as rugged as the magnesium in the XXD cameras and is obviously less expensive. If you take care of your equipment, the T2I will last for years. And if you don't carry some kind of waterproof bag in your case, and keep a UV filter over your lens to protect from moisture, shame on you!Ergonomics. I have owned a Canon 20D, 40D, and 50D. It took me 20 seconds to adapt to the basic T2I configuration. If you haven't used a Canon DSLR, you'll have to learn the configuration anyway and it is really  easy to get going.  In this vein, buy a guidebook ASAP- Amazon has a bunch. The manual that accompanies the camera is worthless. The guides will tell you how to use the  features not just how to find them in the menu. Once I slapped on my walkaround lens (Canon 15-85mm) the lens cradled between thumb and forefinger  of my left hand as if I had been doing it for years- fantastic! Big hands? Buy a Battery grip- You'll need the extra juice for videos. Canon has an expensive one, others have much cheaper copies. Your choice- read the reviews and decide.Here's the bottom line- find a sheet comparing the camera bodies. If there is a feature you find on the 7D that you cannot live without and is not on the T2I your choice is made- just ask yourself if the missing feature on the T2I is worth a thousand bucks!  I almost cried when I found the continuous mode on the T2I was less than half of the rate on the 7D (3.7 pics per sec. vs 8 on the 7D)..........a genuine bummer but no deal breaker- I'll live thru it.  Look-  Canon's loss of market share in the high end amateur market can be your gain. In order to sell more Rebels, they have raided the cupboard, stealing features previously reserved for the big boys and stuffed them into an attractive, solid camera body and selling it for $500! Do your homework- buy a t2I body and the best lens you can afford with the money you save (the 70 200L f4 for telephoto, or maybe a  the Canon 15-85: it's not an L lens but is really sharp and well made. Or if you need the savings for other things, the standard lens (18 55mm IS) is another  super bargain. Either way, you win. One more note- order an SD card (Transcend 32GB SDHC as an example) as none comes with the Camera, and it won't work without a card.Other choices- 60D- relatively same features plus articulated viewing screen: $400 more. Not for me  T3I-again, I read the specs and the only new feature of significance is the screen.  +$150Please understand I'm hooked on Canon.

For best images using flash I set the max ASA to 400 or lower.  In full auto mode the camera will almost always select a very high and slightly noisy ASA.  My advice is to get an 8-32GB fast memory card and always shoot RAW images.  544 RAW images will fit on a 16GB card.  That's plenty for me!On Edit -About video:The video recorded is stunning, and you have the bonus of being able to use a variety of lenses.  The only issue is the noise of the focus motors when you use the on camera microphone.  DO NOT try to use an A-Data memory card! I thought I was getting the deal of a lifetime when I found a 16GB Class 10 card for $30.  When I attempted to record video the camera would overheat and shut down, sometimes after only a few seconds of recording.  Based upon the replies I got from my original review I tried a different 16GB card, this one a Transcend class 6 that I normally use in a Zoom H4, and it works perfectly.  Lesson learned.  Always check the reviews before you buy!The menus are easy to figure out, buttons are well placed and the display is awesome. The camera is very easy to operate once you learn where all the buttons/menus are.Using live view at a slow shutter speed almost always introduces camera shake because the mirror seems to move down-up-down-up every time you fire the shutter.  More work for the mirror mechanism too.  Live View comes in handy for grab shots but be aware of the shutter speed issue and you'll get away with it.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "does pretty much everything at a good price", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RPSCE22PU9O6W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this up at Best Buy for the retail price of $899. There are a lot of companies on Amazon who are trying to sell it much higher as you can see. I originally purchased it on Amazon but it was out of stock so I waited and waited and waited. They still don't have them. So I decided to get one at Best Buy. The camera is excellent. It's much smaller than my Canon 40D, which is nice for carry on bags for planes when traveling with one good lens.Image quality is exellent and so is video. The owners manual says to use a class 6 or higher SD card so I went to Fry's Electonic in Palo Alto and bought one (16 gig, Centon brand- aviod that brand), but lo and behold it cannot handle the video! My transcend 8 gig class 6 CAN handle the 1080p video so try to avoid OFF Brands. Stick with Sandisk, Kingston, etc. HD video uses extreme amounts of memory so get at least an 8 gig minimum. The most possible is 32 gig right now.Anyways, the camera has a beautiful display, fairly fast for its class (3.7 FPS), a decent image stablizing lens and good software for working with RAW files (which are excellent but very large files).", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Mudassir Ali \"Love and Peace for All.\"", "ReviewID": "R465Q1GBHK1PC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new to DSLR camera and learning the tech and skills to take full advantage of this excellent camera.

I had been using a high end 'transition' mirror less camera with built-in zoom and tele and wide angle converters. I had been studying the technical aspects of photography and practicing what I could on the simpler camera. I say all this, because you'll REALLY appreciate this camera if, in actual use, you've 'grown out of' another camera such as a point & shoot.One can get very good values by looking at one or two generation old units that may not have all the 'convenience' features such as positionable or touch screens.I recommend going with an 'i' series Canon which have 18 MP (T2i, T3i T4i) - nearly as high as the low end professional units (21 MP) - rather than the lower resolution non- 'i' models. Also, pick a deal that includes the kit lens you'll be using the most such as the 18-55mm zoom if you like portrait or close up, or the 55-250mm zoom if you're more into nature. Also look for deals that include the extras you'll need - battery & charger, cables, neck strap and such.

Image quality is excellent with the 18 megapixels, button layout is intuitive, and the fully manual exposure video mode is an amazing tool.Thoughts- Excellent Image quality with 18 megapixels sensor- ISO 100-6400 - Solid low light, roughly around 1000 ISO still has low noise- The fully manual exposure mode for video recording is awesome. It's essentially dslr qualiy photography in moving pictures. Very crisp and a great tool for videography.- Nice grip and body design. Feels solidThe 18-55mm F/3.5 - 5.6 IS lens is a good kit lens. The lower part of the focal length (18mm) is good for wide angle shots and the 55mm is good for portrait, essentially similar to the focal length of the human eye. The IS is helpful and images are crisp and clear. Some may outgrow the 18-55mm quickly to due to the 3.5 aperture and seek a faster lens (1.4 or 1.8 50mm)All in all, the video capability is impressive and the image quality is top notch. The T3i thru t5i aren't that much different except the touchscreen that could be found in the t4i and t5i, as well as a higher FPS in the T5i. Other than that, there's no need to buy the \"newest\" camera in the Rebel series. The T2i is seriously not far off from the newest Rebel DSLR cameras.

The pair-up I chose  makes a superb one lens package for any aspiring photog, ranging as it does from a nice 17mm (27mm film equivalent) wide-angle to a decent portrait level telly at 85mm (136mm film equivalent).My T2i has worked flawlessly, and it is rugged too. I've managed to drop mine onto concrete a couple of times and it has not been damaged nor has it failed to work afterwards! I can't tell you how many old 35mm film cameras I've lost doing the very same thing.I recommend sitting down with the camera and the manual one evening and reading through and trying things as you read. Doing so will give you a good overview of its capabilities and make it less likely you will end up defaulting to the full-on auto program mode which will severely limit you as a creative photog, not to mention how much money you will have wasted on a topnotch DSLR that you are only using like a point & shoot.Also, be sure to use the movie mode occasionally.

Price. For what you get, this camera is a bargain. You can find a T2i these days for around 500 bucks if you search around.2. It uses the same senor as higher tiered Canon DSLR cameras like the 60D and the 7D. Thus, the image quality when there is ample lighting between the cameras is almost indistinguishable.3. Weight & size. This thing weighs much less and is more compact than the 60D, 7D, and the 5D Mark II. If you don't like carrying a heavy/big camera setup when travelling, you will appreciate the T2i.CON:1. Not as solid as the 60D, 7D, and 5D in terms of build structure. The low weight and compactness means more plastic parts. More plastic means decreased durability. This camera is also not as weather proof as the aforementioned competitors.2. Crop frame. The 1.6x crop is what bothered me the most about this camera. A 50mm lens isn't actually a 50mm when you have a crop frame camera. This is the main reason why I switched to a full frame.3. The on-camera mic is basically useless for video recording. I'd suggest getting an external mic if you plan to record a lot of video.Overall it's a great entry-level DSLR. I'd highly recommend it for people just getting into DSLR photography but don't have/want to spend the $$$ on a 7D or 5D.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bought this great camera a few months ago.", "Author": "James C.", "ReviewID": "RF4RI0G24LFMG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few months ago and used it to practice on for several months.

And also considering that this camera is now considerably older compared to say, the Canon T3i or the T3i.  I personally upgraded to the Canon EOS 5D Mark III.

The disadvantages is that in low light, the picture is either too dark for grainy to use. A light kit, work light, or daytime shooting can solve this issue.

I bought this for my wife for her birthday present and she absolutely loves it!!  She was using an older Canon that I gave her with low megapixel quality and it still put out pretty decent pictures.  However most people don't print the pictures that they take.  They are mostly used for computer wallpaper, screen savers or digital frames.  These devices are getting larger and larger and become very grainy when using a low megapixel source.  This camera has 18 megapixels and the pictures look like professional photographer quality on her 24\" monitor at work.  Onto the camera itself.  Typical with most of Canon's DSLR cameras they have 2 \"zones\" for taking pictures. Creative and Basic. The basic zone is  used for point and shoot type photographs.  The settings are landscape, portrait, Macro (close ups), action (sports), night and full automatic.  Depending on what you're shooting, set it for the specific mode you need and the camera does the rest.  The creative side is for the photographer that wants to make most, if not all of the adjustments their self.  You can set it for one of 4 different options.  P (program Mode) Aperture and shutter speed are set by the camera with everything else being user set, Av (Aperture Value) to adjust the amount of light coming into the lens, Tv (Time Value) for setting the shutter speed and M (Manual) where all settings are created by the user.  Obviously if you are an amateur you will probably start out using the basic zone.  But as you get more comfortable with the camera you will probably want to experiment with the creative side.  There may be times when you may want the image to be slightly over or under exposed, or maybe slow the shutter speed down to intentionally blur an image such as photographing a waterfall.  Their are other features such as movie mode and self timer which add to the many benefits this camera has.  I highly recommend this camera for the novice up to a semi-professional photographer.  The ease of use, along with excellent picture quality makes this a must have if you want photographs of much better quality than standard point and shoot cameras.  I would recommend buying direct from Amazon rather than a third party source.  I purchased mine from Big Mike's Camera through Amazon because it was the least expensive.  They had removed the factory Canon battery and replaced it with a generic which died after using it twice! I would think because they can sell this battery as original Canon and charge more for it to someone else.

After being made to buy a mini-DV camera entering into film school, I decided to buy a T2i on my way out. My school made us adopt technology as it was going out, and having a mini-DV camera was not of much use to me. I did not enjoy making anything with it.All that changed once I bought myself the T2i. Not only can I create videos with 1080p quality, but can dial in manually exactly what the exposures I choose. This is especially helpful in manipulating the depth-of-field. This cannot be done in even the top of the line consumer camcorders.The best part about the camera is not the video, as much as I love it. It is the pictures. I have missed taking pictures since I was a child using a 35mm camera. My father was an early adopter of digital cameras, however I never seemed to like them, especially considering how awful their resolution was at that point. It took me awhile to consider buying one, but this dSLR is great choice for a beginner photographer looking to gain a better idea of how to capture beautiful images.Overall I would say this is a great camera and takes wonderful pictures. I will say if I had a bigger budget I may have considered one of Canon's full-frame models. The auto settings work quite well, but you can certainly dial in exactly what your looking for as well, making it a great camera to learn how a camera works. If you already know how to work a camera it's a pretty good one for the tight budget.

This is the absolute best camera you can buy for video for the price. I have owned this camera for around a year and am still very happy with the video and still images that come out of this camera.The kit lens is ok. It can put out some fantastic images. I attached one of my dad's old SLR lenses (Pentax 50mm f/1.4) with an adapter and am able to get some very shallow depth of field and low light images and video with it.For operators interested in only home video (birthday party, or opening christmas presents), I would not recommend this camera. You must manual focus constantly throughout the video recording and it cannot record more than 12 minutes in 1080p without having to hit the record button again.For cinematographers interested in making films, I could not recommend a better camera in this price range.If you are going to use this with video, you are going to need an external audio recorder to conquer the Automatic Gain Control (automatically jumping the mic audio levels up and down throughout your shot) (The Magic Lantern Hack can disable this, but I was not willing to install this due to camera and SD card reliability concerns). I bought the Tascam DR-40 to record audio from XLR mics to synchronize in postproduction. I recommend getting a Sandisk 16GB Class 10 card for recording at 1080p. I have lost some important shots because cheaper or slower cards cannot keep up with the camera buffer, stopping the recording. I have not had this issue with my Sandisk Class 10 card. You will also need an LCD Viewfinder and screen protecter. I bought a $30 viewfinder from Cowboystudio.In terms of support, you will need a tripod and/or a shoulder rig.

In making that transition, this camera also has a full auto mode just like the point and shoot cameras do.  I found this a nice feature because it allowed me to first figure out the workings of using an \"adjustable\" lens, while simply focusing and clicking the shutter button.  It also has other shooting modes like the P&S; cameras.  Another easy way to roughly figure out the camera's capabilities for certain conditions.  Working my way from P&S; mode to manual settings, I do find the much more expanded and precise control of settings a God send over the manual settings of the P&S; cameras.  On my P&S;, the camera will at times override the manual settings I picked because it didn't think they were the best?  No issue here.  If I make a boo-boo on a setting, I can see the error and fix it accordingly.  I also enjoy the multiple focus points.  It makes getting the correct subject of the picture in focus much easier than only having one point on the P&S.;  The absolute biggest peeve I've always had with the P&S; cameras is the slow speed of the flash; both the charging time and actual flash while taking a picture.  On the T2i, it is lightning quick.I could go on and on about the pros of this camera for those looking to take the next step.

I looked mainly at the t3i and t2i. After finally making the determination that I needed to stick to my budget I chose the t2i.

This camera has the capability to this, which is a big deal for me because I use this camera to do photography for a church. I also have 3 kids and I wanted to be able to have a decent burst rate on the camera. Additionally I wanted a camera that had a control layout that made sense and just \"flowed\"The canon t2i delievered on all these accounts.

[...] is THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE I USED in searching and making a final decision)So a few cons that I've noticed for me is:the sound of the shutter is a little loud for me, because I am in situations where the atmosphere is quiet and it can be a little distracting to hear some guy (me) taking shots.DO NOT GET THE 18-55mm kit lens. This is the only regret that I have in purchasing this camera. I should have made the extra push and gotten the 18-135mm. I read other people say not to get this lens and I should have listened to them! The reason being the reach of the 55mm is really short. In my line of use for the camera I need to be able to capture shots that I just cannot get closer to. PLEASE. if  you are going to get a kit lens, make it the 18-135mm.Other than those two qualms.

It's a Canon, so the image quality is sharp, and every single Canon SLR lens made in the past 20 years or so will work with it.  It's far more capable than most amateur photographers will ever need.Professionals, on the other hand, will want the full-size sensor.  Wide angle shots are nearly impossible with the 1.6x sensor in the T2i. (I know, because I tried it.)That said, for what I use it for (aviation photography using telephoto lenses), it is absolutely perfect.  The body is lightweight and fairly easy to handle (people with overly large hands be wary), and the balance isn't too bad with a heavy lens hanging off the front (did take a bit of getting used to, I was used to a much heavier body on the other side of my lens (Rebel T1i), but now It doesn't bother me).  This is one responsive camera!  It works better with my 55-250 lens than my T1i did, giving me much faster and more consistent autofocus.The 18MP sensor is fantastic, and I've used up to ISO 1600 with little artifacts showing up in the image.  I don't need to go higher than 1600, because I don't shoot at night (my lenses aren't fast enough).Video takes a bit of getting used to.  Like others have said, you need to be prepared to manually focus, especially if you zoom.  My biggest issue with shooting video is that my subjects are usually moving really fast, and the LCD doesn't refresh fast enough to allow me to track it in panning shots.  So, until I can find a way to set up an exterior sight, I won't be using video much.All in all, an excellent camera, you won't be disappointed if you buy one!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier", "Author": "dom085", "ReviewID": "RGO5JHQVVSS18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before committing to the T2i (including what the actual differences were between Canon's series) and I couldn't be happier.The only real feature the T3i has over this is the flip out LCD, which is not something I would really use. Over 90% of the time, I'm shooting through the view finder anyway.I went for the combo with the 18-55 and the 55-250 telephoto. Very happy with the telephoto during a graduation ceremony. The very fast continuous drive (~3 shots/second with the shutter button held down) was truly irreplaceable. I would have missed a lot of opportunities using a point and shoot.If you're just going to leave this camera in \"auto\" I highly recommend getting the S95 or something similar and saving some money. However, if you're willing to experiment with aperture or shutter speed priority and gradually shift towards full manual, you'll be amazed at the potential in this machine.

Photographers' technical jargon made my head hurt so I avoided SLR cameras.  I imagined being overwhelmed by their complexity, not to mention their price.  But I love great photography and I kept noticing amazing photographs by amateurs on Flickr, a popular photography website.  Most of the photos I liked were the product of digital SLR cameras with names like Canon and Nikon.  They stood out from the rest and I was hooked.  It was time for me to spring for a digital SLR if the price was right.A friend had a Canon T2i and he demonstrated how easy it was to use in the Basic Modes.  I didn't have to know anything about f-number, shutter speed, ISO, HMO or whatever.  All I had to do is point and shoot.  Portraits, landscapes, action shots, close-ups, day or night, with or without flash, even HD movies, it didn't matter.  The camera did all the work.  It was like the autopilot on a jet.  The camera was as easy to use as my trusty pocket camera but with a remarkable difference in the final product.  The quality was apparent.  The Canon pictures were consistently sharp with colors that popped off the screen when downloaded to a computer.As I get serious about learning photography and wish to take greater control of the camera, the T2i has it covered.  With its 5 Creative Modes the camera allows me to take control a little at a time in 4 semi-automatic modes and, when I feel bold enough, I can solo in the full manual mode. It's an amazing camera and a marvel of technology, and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg.  The Canon EOS Rebel T2i was a few hundred dollars more than my old \"point and shoot\" camera, which I still carry in my pocket.  I save the Canon for special occasions where a lesser camera simply won't do.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "edwin nava", "ReviewID": "R4CAWPBPHY68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "High quality product, I recommend, is one of the best of canon, I am a follower of the Rebel and I love this", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great starter Camera for Digital Filmmaking!", "Author": "Brock", "ReviewID": "R3OB985A84FE8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR, but as a person just getting into photography/digital filmmaking, I'm not complaining one bit here. I'll base my review solely from a digital filmmaking viewpoint as that is why I bought the camera and there are already a lot of reviews on the photographic quality on here. I'll go with the pros and cons to make it easier to understand why as a beginning digital filmmaker this is a great camera to get into as compared to a high-end consumer camcorder.Pros:-exceptional image quality (the ability to use lots of different lenses is going to create a much better image than your basic consumer-grade camcorder)-compact-allows the filmmaker to get into tight spaces where you can get into with larger professional cameras (you even see major film productions utilizing DSLR's for their films now because of this reason alone)-lightweight-obviously great for photography-you also have free range to set it to manual mode and set the ISO speed, aperture and shutter speed to get the best image possibleCons:-not very good built-in sound quality (but no DSLR or consumer-grade camcorder has good built-in sound)-at higher ISO levels the picture might get slightly grainy, but not that noticeable-obviously you have to have a very steady hand in operating a DSLR for both photography and digital filmmaking (even being as steady as possible it will still pick up little movements, a follow-focus and tripod can solve this problem)-Also, there is the potential of the camera's internal temperature increasing due to shooting too long. I recommend when shooting digital film that whenever not using the camera for actually shots, shut it off to decrease the likelihood of the camera shutting off automatically. Try and get your shots and shut it off as soon as you can.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this camera as a solid introduction to digital filmmaking.* In terms of digital filmmaking, it doesn't get much better if you are starting out. The next step up from this in terms of digital filmmaking is the Canon 5D and 7D which both push the $1500-$2500 range. And then your next step up from those is the Red One which pushes the $18,000-$20,000 range (which is now utilized in major motion pictures shooting entire films using the Red One, e.g. The Social Network, The Hobbit films coming out, etc). So you can obviously see what kind of quality you're dealing with here.*Note: If you are just looking to take home movies of your family, sporting events or general personal use without getting into major editing, go with a consumer-grade camcorder instead. I only recommend this for a person getting into digital filmmaking and doing heavy editing.

This review is not based on having owned several other DSLR cameras. This is the first DSLR I owned, having used others and compared to anything I have ever used, this thing is mind blowing. I would recommend learning a little about photography to really harness the power of this unit, although learning with this unit has been easier then I would have expected.I bought this instead of the Sony or Nikon because it seems to have the largest customer base, and the big brother to the this appears to be the camera of choice by most professionals. The T3i was also a unit I considered, although the T3i is larger it appears that it only has a tilt screen compared to the T2i. I am still on the fence if I should have got the T3i, although $100 bucks to have a tilting screen seemed overpriced at first, it almost appears worth it when shooting at weird angles.The USB computer integration is really nice and I think the camera control software seems really up to date, and not 'crapwear' like what I have seen with other platforms.Video quality is very good, I think the Sony probably does a better job based on my research but this is still nice, shooting video at night was ok.My only gripe is missing GPS receiver, but I guess this isn't really a reasonable complaint, although the Sony did have it.Accessories for these Canon DSLRs are everywhere so that's a real big plus. I bought the battery grip just for added balance (from amazon for $40). Also the 55mm-250mm zoom is a great add-on.Night shooting is mind blowing, I walked outside with a tripod and set the shutter to 4 seconds, cranked up the ISO and was shooting what looked like daytime. It was very dark, I couldn't see anything, but a couple seconds and the T2i looked like I shot in the daytime. Longer shutter time and lower ISO reduced image noise. Point it to the night sky and set it open for 20 seconds and it shows you things you cannot see with the naked eye, amazing!Learned about Aperture Value and that allowed me to take some trick shots with everything in focus.All in all, I am very satisfied and I think this is a great starter DSLR to learn with, $700 bucks for amazing images.

I did extensive research at DPReview before purchasing this camera.  For the money, this was a no brainer.  So far everything has worked perfectly.  Battery life was as advertised.  Image quality in Raw format was very impressive. Even jpg's looked great.  I only considered Canon for my purchase.  The only question was, which one?  The T2i's features are that of a $1k + camera.  I have about 200 actuations and have not had one really bad shot.  About half of those are on full manual.  The metering modes work well, focusing modes work extremely well, burst is fast a crisp. The supplied software is not cheesy as is with some camera's out there.  My girlfriend shoots with a 40D and I have always shot canon so I wanted to stick with the EF format to swap lens with her.  Kit lens is a good all around lens, its not very fast but it gets the job done.  This camera has the entry level build quality but it feels very solid and the controls are very well thought out.  The only issue I have with it is the flash popup.  Sometimes I have my hand there and I don't even feel the flash trying to popup and I block it.  IT errors out and you have to restart camera to reset it.  Aside from that (and that is my fault really)  Everything works as well as can be expected.  If you want the most features for your money, get this camera.  Its specs are off the charts and at the 700 - 800 price point, it can't be beat.  Get a fast SD card though, don't skimp there.  My old 8gig SD card works but shooting in Raw+L, it could not keep up.  I picked up a 16 gig Class 10 card and I'm not waiting around to take the next shot.  I shoot fast, I don't compose long at all, even in manual.  The controls let you easily change exposure settings fast as they are very well laid out.  ISO 6400 is amazing on this camera.  I have been pleasantly surprised with very low grain at that setting.  I've not yet jumped to 12k because 6400 works well beyond my expectations.  Add a grip to this camera and it feels like a quality build.  This is the best camera for the money in APS-C in my opinion.

After a lot of researching, price comparing, and budgeting I decided on this, and I really feel like I have a winner here!! I went with the body only, because I wanted to build my kit from the ground up.The camera is just amazing! although, it took a while to get used to, and I KNOW I haven't even begun to get through all the bells and whistles. The pictures are sharp and clear, and it's fast (but it does tend to slow down in continuous shooting mode).  I know it's not the fastest camera on the market, but to get anymore fps, you would have to pay a small fortune.The buttons are all easily accessible and I could pretty much figure out where everything was and what everything did before too long.  I love the dedicated ISO button!! It makes things a lot easier when I have to change settings quickly.  I also like the positioning of the shutter button, it seems more comfortable to me than having it on top of the body where most shutter buttons are.Like I said, I'm an amateur, and haven't figured everything out yet.  I haven't had an opportunity yet to put it through any major tests yet, once the weather gets nicer I'll go to the zoo, and see how if I can get any good action shoots of animals.  In the meantime, I did manage to create a time-lapse video of the night sky using 300+ images.  It took some decent pictures of the stars, so that was really cool, although I made the newbie mistake of not using the correct ISO setting, and there was a lot of noise, but that was my fault, not the cameras.  And, of course I took some pictures of my pets, which turned out quite nicely.I am extremely happy with this investment! If you are just starting out, I would really recommend this.

With the 250mm lens, I was able to take a picture of the moon and zoom in to see surface features like I never had before. The 18MP allows you to really zoom in to the pictures and see amazing amount of detail.Do not buy this camera for video. It does not auto focus while shooting. The quality is good if the camera is going to be sitting in one spot and the subject does not move much. Canon HD Camcorders do a great job at taking video.I got an incredible deal from Amazon.

Jeohn", "ReviewID": "R1Z3G5FWFWMCVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a stills camera, this thing can't be beat for the price. Video/audio is a different story however. Let me share a few of them with you now:Video banding issue -no way around:----------------------------------I was shooting an indoor video test when I noticed subtle banding as I recorded against a white wall. The higher I set my shutter speed, the worse it got. It was like watching an old tv set with bad reception -thick banding lines moving slowly up the screen.Canon tech support wasn't sure why this was happening and suggested that I try shooting under different lighting conditions (???... really?) and they were right; the worst was flourescent lighting (the donut ring type), not so bad under CF bulbs and no issues in sunlight. I didn't have halogen or led lights to test with.I've since found out this banding is an issue on all T2i's. So if you're looking to shoot video, it means you can't shoot under certain types of light without seeing this phenomenon. Test first.Audio sensitivity issue -a way around:-------------------------------------If you want to reap the benefits of professional looking video, you'll need to set it up like a pro rig and input the settings manually -it's a project; you can't get away with pressing the record button and hoping it works itself out.You already know there's no continuous autofocus and that means doing it manually. But since the mic is attached to the body, the noise from you turning the zoom and focus ring will be captured (and pretty loudly too). The cheapest way around this is obviously to take static video (pre-focused, no zoom). But if you're recording any type of movement, the next best thing is to pick up a separate mic (with mount, i.e. Rodes video condenser mic) to help isolate all that noise.Class 10 rated cards are sometimes not enough:---------------------------------------------Don't count on the class rating of your memory card for sustained write speeds. I use a class 10 rated Transcend SDHC card and for me, it's fine for most photos and low res videos/short clips. But it starts sputtering when asked to save HD video and continuous RAW+jpg shots. It just can't keep up with the ferocious amounts of data. What to do? Sandisk Extreme comes to the rescue... at 3 times the price.Avoid most lense hoods:----------------------I bought a collapsible rubber lense hood for an 18-55mm lense. But at 18mm, the corners of your photos will have caught a good chunk of the hood. Fail #1.I then bought a tulip petal type hood to avoid Fail #1. In theory a great idea -but what the sellers don't tell you is that you screw on the hood via the filter threads. The end result is a hood lense that rotates every time you focus, giving you black patches in your photos as the hood's long edge moves around. Fail #2.What to do... I would purchase a good lense filter to get started.Overall a great camera.

That being said, if you are buying this camera to use as a full time video camera, keep this point in mind: The T2i has DSLR auto focus, and thus is not very well suited for capturing fast moving objects that need to be in focus constantly (like children, pets or stock cars). This is not the camera you should buy to record precious family moments or take to \"the big game.\"The biggest problem I have with the T2i is the obsessive drive to buy more cool stuff it inspires. Ironically, the T2i's biggest asset is its price, yet the sheer ability of this camera outpaces all of the equipment that people on a budget could possibly afford.

The only problem I've run in to so far was finding an SDXC card to use with it. The cards are still REALLY expensive, and the technology doesn't seem like it's completely cooked. I say that because I've been through two Kingston class 6 SDXC 64 GB cards that worked for about 20 mins then failed (see some of the other reviews on them).

Can't afford the 5D or 7D?  Look no further.", "Author": "Dan134 \"dan134\"", "ReviewID": "RHBOSMRU5TUI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon T2i is the latest in Canon's Rebel line of entry-level/prosumer DSLR cameras.  I will keep this review incredibly short.  If you want to shoot video but do not want to pay for the 7D's bells and whistles (mostly in terms of still photography and build quality) and can't afford the 5D MkII, go for the Canon T2i.  The chip is nearly the same as the 7D, provides the same stunning results in terms of video.  I wish these cameras were available when I was a student, because these provide amazing results and cost very little compared to pro-sumer camcorders.There are a few negatives with this camera, and I will list them here so future buyers are aware:-Do not purchase the variable aperture kit lenses if you are shooting video.  The aperture will change mid-recording even if you set the aperture to the lowest, i.e. when setting a 3.5-5.6 lens at 5.6, the lens still automatically changes apertures when zooming or panning into a different light source.  Get the body only and invest in something like the 99 dollar 50mm 1.8.-Sound is pretty worthless in camera.  If you are buying this for interviews, documentary, or anything where on set sound is necessary you will need to invest in an external audio recorder, which will cost around 200-400 dollars on the low end.  You can also purchase a mic capable of connecting to a 3.5mm input, but you still won't be able to monitor levels.  Go with an external recorder such as the Zoom H4N.-The camera is incredibly light.  Some people might consider this a \"plus\" but it most certainly is not when shooting video.  If you don't have surgeons hands, operating the t2i handheld will be very jittery.  The weight of the magnesium alloy build is one of the pluses of the more expensive 7D.  You can remedy this issue by attaching a battery grip, which helps a lot, using a tripod, or purchasing a shoulder mount rig.That's all I can think of for now.  If you're on the fence about buying this camera, don't hesitate.

The two main reasons I wanted to upgrade were to get Live View (too many people we hand the camera to don't remember how to use optical view finders, and sit there staring at the LCD waiting for it to show a preview), and video.  When our son was born, we bought a digital video camera, but found that we had either the still or the video camera, and never both, or didn't want to take both when we travel (but wanted more than our little Sony point and shoot that also does mediocre video).  So, I got this model, and have to say, they've made a ton of enhancements in the 3 years since we got our XTi.The image sensor is about 10 MP better than our old one, which wasn't a surprise, but the image quality really is night and day.  Our XTi always shot nice pictures, but this is a different level completely.  Colors are truer (in our opinion), and the photos just look better all around.  I'm no photo expert, so I can't comment on the specifics, but I know it looks better to me.The camera overall seems to work better.  Faster processing is the main difference.

You also can't get rid of the little white box that's used for focusing.  I move it to the corner of the screen, but it's still a part of the live feed image.

Its. Not as light&cheap; feeling as the t1. Its just comfortable light.And the only reason i got this one instead of the t3i was because im not into vid much so a swivel display wasnt really neccesaary for me. The pictures come out fantastic. Good colors good tone. The iso isnt crazy noisy as compared to point and shoots. I can shoot 1600 or sumtimes even 3200 ISO and it be usable.The burst isnt lightning fast but for overall normal Photogtaphy thts not a problem.The 18mm-55mm lens isnt too bad. You can get ridiculously close and in focus,and the 55mm zoom is decent unless youre needed to take sports pics or outdoor photography or are really far back at a concert.Overall very satisfied. I take pics at least once a week.

As I have rather small hands I actually preferred the size factor of the T2i and any less weight I have to heft around for a full day of shooting is a definite plus. All buttons and controls felt identical and the sound of the shutter on both sounded solid, substantial and like a fine tuned instrument. It's low light performance, in particular, deserves mention. This thing can take a well exposed picture in a coal mine without flash. It's just amazing. The price of this is just hard to believe.

I never, in all my 72 years, even imagined that any camera could be this wonderful.  Certainly not this camera body for only $715.00.  And I already own five Canon lenses.UPDATE 10/08/12I've used the T2i for close to two years now, mainly with my Canon 28-135mm Ultrasonic IS lens.  Mostly I make photographs of dogs at the local dog park.  Often times I will shoot children and the adults that accompany their dogs.  I also like to shoot plants up close.  This lens is heavy but it supports most everything I like to shoot outdoors during daylight hours.  It appears to me to produce quite sharp images throughout the f-stop and focal length range.  The Ultrasonic focus is great for shooting moving dogs and children.  The range of focal length is almost ideal for my kind of outdoor shooting.  I also use a battery expansion/camera grip (and the Canon 580EX II speedlite when needed).Okay, I still love my T2i. I just don't understand why Amazon is now selling the T2i body for more than the T3i body.  The T3i has the same size sensor and some improved functions.  Of course I have to recommend the T3i over the T2i.  The price of either camera is attractive.However, While I can't find a lot in the Canon T4i that would improve my pics, I still want one.

IF you are looking to shoot HD videos for the price this camera is excellent. It is comparable to the Canon 7d and half of the cost. Make sure you buy 16gb Sdhc cards or larger as recording in full 1080p uses a lot of space. Also the lens that comes with this camera is \"average\" and not very good. I would suggest buying the body only and saving up for a better lens ( not to much more) in the $300 price range. What the better lenses allow are able to shoot in less light and provide a further zoom range.

The Rebel T2i is slightly above mediocre in quality and capability, but that can be expected from a mid-line camera.  The picture quality definitely struggles at high ISO.  The biggest disappointment was the manner in which I was treated by customer service when the camera experienced problems.  I was told my warranty was void due to significant water damage, damage that would \"require significant submersion to incur.\"  That camera never leaves my sight, and it shut off mid-picture while on vacation, nor was it ever once submerged or splashed in any way.  The most infuriating part was the bill they sent, which totaled more than the cost of the camera brand new.  I tried to speak with customer service on multiple occasions but they were unable to understand my concerns with the defective product or the situation, only to cite the voided warranty and the necessary repair.  Their responses unfortunately betrayed that they had not been listening to anything I had said or the questions I was asking, only reciting a set of routine responses which were often times irrelevant to the topic at hand.  Unfortunately the Canon quality reputation does not apply to the Rebel T2i, nor does their customer support system.  I would definitely NOT recommend this camera.  Over the last weeks I have experimented with both Sony and Nikon, and Canon is about to lose an extremely loyal customer.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great IQ, but kit lens is junk and video files may overwhelm your PC", "Author": "Edgar_in_Indy", "ReviewID": "R2AIG36S1IJ4ZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered a T2i without ever seeing one in person, and was surprised to discover how small and light it was. I don't have large hands, so it wasn't a problem, but it is rather compact compared to the semi-pro, and pro cameras. The light weight is nice for carrying around, but if you buy a high-quality zoom lens or a long telephoto, the whole package may not balance as nicely as a larger camera.The image quality is incredible, with more detail and less noise than anything this side of a 5DII. Being able to capture clean, beautiful images at ISO 1600 and 3200 will change the way you approach photography. For even better results, noise reduction software such as NeatImage will let your high ISO images look as good as 200 or 400 or 800 ISO from previous DSLR's.Despite the great IQ, I ended up selling my T2i on Craigslist because I was disappointed with how \"plasticy\" the Rebel T2i felt to handle, and how extremely cheap the 18-55 kit lens looks, feels, and performs. I know that this is a \"Rebel\", but still, for $900 I was expecting something that felt more solid, and I just didn't have anything left in the budget for a better lens.The 18-55 lens is a serious mismatch for the 18MP sensor of this camera. It would be kind of like if Chevy sold the new 426hp Camero SS with Continental all-season tires instead of the Pirelli P-Zero's. It'll work, but you'll be missing out on the full potential.If you don't have the budget to upgrade the lens, I wouldn't bother with the T2i since the lens will be a bottle-neck to the 18MP sensor, since the optics just aren't there to take advantage of 18MP. And the lens looks very cheap, and the zoom action feels equally cheap and the front lens element turns on focus. And it doesn't even come with a lens hood, and the optional lens hood looks ridiculous.I was coming from an Olympus e-520, which looks and feels like a much more expensive camera than the Rebels, and has very high-quality kit lenses, both build-wise and optically.I was also disappointed with the difficulty of playing and working with the Quicktime videos on a PC. And my PC is a fairly well-spec'd dual-core with 4GB of RAM, 10K Raptor HDD and an nVidia 8800GT video card. Quicktime is an Apple format, so if you have a newer Mac I don't think you should have any problems with the video. If you're planning to use this with a PC though, you should find a website that lets you download un-edited video samples to see how they run on your machine.After selling the T2i, I ended up buying a white Pentax K-x w/18-55mm lens for literally half the price, so I still had enough money left over for the legendary Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 lens, the Pentax 55-300mm lens, and a Sigma speedlight. The Speedlight I bought new, and the lenses I bought used on eBay and Craigslist. Other than the smaller image file, K-x has image quality equal to the T2i, but I find the smaller 12MP files and the MJPEG video much easier to work with and the videos look great for my home movies. Plus, the Pentax has in-body image stabilization, so any lens is stabilized by default. And the Pentax cameras/kit lenses are similar to Olympus in quality.

It has too many nasty little problems like having problems to resolve tiny details in shadows or in contrast light (middle age people look REALLY OLD when you photograph them with this camera because it makes the face wrinkles so pronounced), and I don't care for the skin tone rendition (well known issue and I subscribe to it). Older Canon cameras, starting from 10D up to 40D didn't have these problems. But they didn't have these video capabilities either and that's exactly what makes it a tough call. Get 40D for stills and T2I (550D) for video and you'll be golden. Oh, and one more thing. The T2i usually renders blue eyes as colorless gray in natural light. A deal breaker for me, because my entire family is blue-eyed. Hope this helps.PS: 5D Mark II, 60D, T3i (600D) all suffer from the same little weaknesses: no ability to resolve tiny detail in shadows; un-natural skin tones; heavy dependence on perfect lighting in order to get acceptable color and detail rendition.

I had a Canon film SLR way back in the day, and then had a Canon G5 for more than 4 years and then a G9 for more than two years before I decided to upgrade to a digital SLR. So in August 2010, I purchased the Canon T2i right after it was released.  I didn't purchase a warranty because I've never had a Canon product break (including other products like video cameras and scanners).In April 2012, as I was taking photos of the Space Shuttle Discovery flyover in Washington, DC, my T2i completely failed. It wouldn't take any photographs and was flashing \"ERR 80.\" As it turns out, Error 80 means an Electronic control or image malfunction. I did a lot of research on online forums and followed a lot of their troubleshooting techniques (switching SD cards, taking out battery, etc.), but nothing worked. When I called Canon tech support, they told me that ERR 80 basically it means that the internal electronic component just completely failed. Since I was outside the one year warranty period, I had to pay $197 for repairs. I struggled with the decision and wondered if it would just be easier to buy a new camera. But, since the camera was only a year-and-a-half old or so, I decided to pay the $197 for repairs.Fast forward less than three months later. My husband and I are in Philadelphia visiting the Liberty Bell. My T2i, once again, just completely fails. This time it's flashing \"ERR 70.\" Disappointed that I won't be taking pictures at such an historic location, I start researching ERR 70 on the internet on my iPhone, and find out that it's an Image Malfunction. So I switch memory cards. Nope. I format the new memory card. Still doesn't work. I look up some quick troubleshooting and nothing works.I call Canon and the repairs for ERR 70 will only be covered if they find that it was caused by something they did during the repairs for ERR 80.  Even more disappointing than the money I'm out though are the memories I wasn't able to capture on camera!In my assessment, the Canon T2i is a complete lemon. Stay away. And if you do buy it, invest in the warranty!**Update December 2013***I am throwing this camera in the garbage.  I was just taking pictures of my nieces and nephews for Christmas, and once again, for the THIRD TIME IN THREE YEARS, my camera has completely failed.  Flashing an ERR 70, just like it did in August 2012.  Unable to take any photos despite switching memory cards, batteries, and even lenses.  Stay away.

I'd get a Panasonic GH2 if I had the money. Its a few hundred more but better video quality. Or a HDHero2.This camera is a few hundred dollars overpriced in my opinion. The Canon $75 Canon HD Powershot takes just as good of pictures. Only the HD video is different. I tried doing a little work with it, charging people for videos, and it turned out pretty bad with the lenses I used. The lenses I bought were the basic kit lens which came with the package, and a 75-355mm. You really have to get great lenses for the T2i to be worth it. Don't do the kit lens or the $100 75-200mm lens at all. Save up and get a better lens. The 75-200mm is ok but the kit lens pretty much sucks for videos. It's just not worth $700.I got this camera thinking it was going to be outstanding for the price and I'm not convinced yet. Its a plastic camera and very basic. The different shot modes really don't change the picture all that much, if at all. You can get some good shots from this camera but the quality is hit and miss. It's not all that great. You can get some really good pics, but mostly you get really average shots. You gotta \"milk\" the camera for a good shot. It almost reminds me of a kids toy camera. It's sad they charge so much for these things, but I guess camera sales is a lucrative business.I used to own a Nikon D70 and even though the body on that camera was primitive it took beautiful shots. I sold it when I got this one :( My gf's iphone takes better pictures to tell you the straight up truth.I will give this product a 5/10 because its so cheap. It can potentially record really nice video if you know what you are doing, BUT, unless you have at least a 16GB level 10 SD memory card you won't be able to record longer than 1 or 2 minutes. And you have to have great lighting. It does not perform well in low light situations. It's decent in the sunlight or well lit rooms, but low light SUCKS.The camera turns off every 12 minutes when you are recording so you have to watch out for that or turn it off and on in between takes and different shots. It can be frustrating to have the camera turn off on you while you are filming a scene. (I shot a few short videos for videography class).-Oh and for the haters who are arguing with me: I took a Photography course a few months before buying this camera, as well as a videography course. I know how to work it.-I converted 2 HQ 24FPS 1080p HD quality videos and they lost A LOT of pixels and resolution during conversion and rendering. And I used a Mac OSX to do it on. Can't even imagine what my little Dell PC with 1GB of Ram would do to the video quality :pThe battery doesn't last too long either. In HD video mode it lasts about 10-15 minutes of straight shooting. Bring an extra battery or two with you on shoots if you do buy it for the video aspect because it will go through batteries quick.Conclusion: Its a plastic camera that works, but isn't nearly the best quality or even the quality it advertises for. For a person who has $700 to blow it may work out for you, but I think you can find a better camera for the price. I just don't have the money to waste finding the best deal, and good luck finding the truth about these. I researched for months before I made the decision to buy this one and it's NOT easy going. They all make great claims and who knows if the video they shoot with is even from this camera. The problem with camera shopping is it seems like nobody tells you the straight up truth about what is the best camera for the price. I'm sure there are better cameras out there for under $700 but I have no clue how to find out without talking to someone who has owned a ton of cameras and isn't selling you something. -Don't trust Ken Rockwell either.

So it's a programming problem, not my particular camera.I used the camera at night on Night Landscape and got a 400 ISO!!  It's almost like the sensor is backward, giving way too much ISO in sun and not enough in dark.The only thing Canon could tell me was to shoot in the manual modes then I could control the settings.

The camera should have a receptacle so the AC power cord can plug directly into the camera.I never took the camera out of the box & am returning it.

No nice crisp feel to the selector knob, loose actually, not even as good as my old non-digital 35mm (a Chinon, possibly older than me, but it takes great pictures).  Plugged in the brand knew 16gb sd card, didn't feel like it went in right, like sticking the card into playdough, again, shouldn't be having these kind of doubts \"at this price point.\"  Oh brother.  As for the guy who wrote \"...The camera is very small and light. It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't \"feel cheap\" in my opinion...\"  Well in my opinion, IT DOES FEEL CHEAP and i'm taking it back tomorrow.  But to be fair, i'm sure he's right about it not being weather-sealed.Update 7/18/2010: Much happier now, got the Pentax K-7 (weather sealed), better feel and very good pictures.  Camera body, plus Pentax 18-55 lens lens cost $926.50 plus shipping.  All through Amazon.
