Mass market cameras are a sideline for them to privilege us with their technology in a consumer package.Here is the simplest, cheapest, coolest little camera among the pack of little cams.

There is a lot of technology whipping around inside the package that I can well appreciate.Because the name is not Nikon or Canon, don't be put off. Fuji consumer products always seem to insure that you get more delight for your money as Fuji fights the known brands for market share by one-upping the competition.

I purchased this little camera for its size and good reviews - and for the bright, cheerful colors offered....not to mention the very attractive price on Amazon.  There have been many times when I was traveling (locally or longer trips) that I saw a scene I wanted to capture but did not have my camera with me.  My Z20 is small enough to easily slip into my purse, or even a shirt pocket.  And it is so easy to use - its ready to shoot the moment you slide back the lens cover.  While my other camera has 10x optical and 5x digital zoom, and may be better for some shots, with the Z20's 10mp along with the 3x optical zoom, I can easily crop the picture to size and retain the clarity.  And the review feature lets you zoom in to the smallest features in the picture to be sure you have critical areas in focus.  It even has face recognition, which my more expensive camera does not.

I was looking to replace it with another like-quality camera, but with added megapixels & features. The Kodak originally cost me $279, so when I found this Fujifilm Finepix 10 megapixel camera for only $159, I was thrilled! I figured I would be getting WAY more bang for my buck. And on paper, it seemed like it had almost every feature that other, higher priced cameras have (like Canon's Powershot cameras). Well, I was disappointed after only a few hours. It takes lovely brightly colored pictures, INCREDIBLE close-up macro shots, but the shutter speed and response time left something to be desired. Also, the pictures all turned out a bit grainy, and with lots of purple edges when zoomed in all the way.What it comes down to is quality of parts. Yes, this camera does everything it says it will, but not as well as higher priced cameras. You get what you pay for.If you're just looking for a fun point & shoot camera, and aren't picky about details, this would be an excellent camera. But don't replace a mid-grade camera with this one.

Every photo I took (whether indoor, outdoor with sunlight, flash, no flash) was very grainy and just bad quality. I can't imagine how grainy the photos would have been if I had tried to print them! I normally use a Canon Rebel Digital SLR camera, so I may be \"spoiled\" by more professional looking shots, but I was looking for a point and shoot that would still give me decent quality photos so I wouldn't have to carry the big camera around.

I liked it, but the picture quality left me a little miffed. They're not horrible, but not fantastic either. So I got a canon instead. It took great pictures for all of 24 hours before some drunken idiot at a party snatched it out of my hands and dropped it no more than 3 feet. That canon was trashed beyond repair; talk about weak! So I went back to my fujifilm. At yet another party, my brother in law was holding onto my purse for me. After some dude provoked him, in his drunken rage (I have got to stop hanging around drunk people) he slammed it like a hammer on the concrete, with my fujifilm inside. After checking the camera over, I had seen that the entire front casing had been bent and warped by the force of the hit. To my surprise, the lil' trooper was fine! It took pictures like nothing had happened. It lasted me a whole 2 years after that until I got myself a DSLR.If you're clumsy, or if you're like me and hang around too many douche buckets, this is a fantastic little piece of equipment.

There is a large viewing screen and operating sounds can be silenced for unobtrusive use.  There are plenty of operating options including an auction setting where multiple images can be included in a single frame.  A memory card must be purchased separately (but the camera can be used out-of-the-box with approximately 45MB built-in memory).

It has many options that I was not expecting to find in a product for this price. Videos have a good quality and sound. However, I found that most of my pictures are not clear. When I passed to my computer and I use them as a background, I can notice the pixels on the pictures. I have not found the way to make them look better even when I am using the max resolution.In conclusion, I am happy with the camera and its size.

I gave it only four stars because it's a pain in the neck to tell people not to move when the flash goes off the first time (that's when it's focusing).  I was taking a picture of my husband, the flash went off and he moved. I pressed the shutter down the rest of the way and it went off again.  The picture turned out great.  I'm used to having a viewfinder, so learning how to use the LCD screen is a new process.  The camera is quite small, fits in my purse beautifully so I'll always have it ready.  I like that it has face detection, anti-shake and redeye removal. Makes it easier just to download and print the pictures.  The slider that covers the lens is a great timesaver.  No more having to push buttons to turn off the camera, just slide the slider into position and your safe to go.  Been using this camera now ever since I wrote the review.  I've gotten a couple good pics from it but I don't care what mode I shoot in most of them are dark and unclear. I have to do enhancements to get a good picture. I like the size of the camera, the slider front but that's about all.  I'm now looking to get a Canon, I've had all the Fuji I can take.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pocket Camera", "Author": "Gary M.
