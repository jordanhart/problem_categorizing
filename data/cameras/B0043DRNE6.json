Davie", "ReviewID": "R10OOYN78YIK60", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an emergency after leaving my nice Canon on the Amtrak to Denver. I paid $60 at Office Depot knowing full well it would be a low-end point and shoot. Frankly, it's amazing what you can get for such little money. I've read plenty of one and two star reviews of cheapo Vivitars on Amazon, and it's baffling that people expect them to match the quality of cameras costing five times as much.My one big complaint about this camera is the lag between pressing the shutter button and the taking of the picture. The viewfinder goes blank, but you need to wait a second or two before the picture is taken. I ended up getting plenty of blurred photos because I was moving the camera after thinking the shot had been taken.I'm always skeptical of those that claim \"it just stopped working!\" Nine times out of ten, the product was abused out of ignorance or unrealistic expectations. My personal experience with this camera after taking dozens of photos over hundreds of miles is that it is reliable, but must be treated for what it is, a delicate piece of electronics.Now that I'm back home I'll be purchasing another nice camera to replace my beloved Canon. The Vivitar will find a good home with a deserving child that will treat it with care.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "does not work", "Author": "x \"angelmom\"", "ReviewID": "R1PDNMP7AJM4NC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this camera is a piece of junk. the battery compartment cover broke off the first day. turns itself off for no reason while you are using it. then it won't turn back on for 2 or 3 minutes. the video mode does not even work at all (yes i installed a 8g memory card) it burns through batteries very quickly. it takes almost 3 seconds to take a picture after you press the shutter button. i paid $27 for this camera and i'm returning it. it does not come with a proper manual, only a quickstart manual.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Marie Cairns Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2FGZ06PRFSHG1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is not worth the trouble.
