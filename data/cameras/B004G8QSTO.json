{"Reviews": [{"Title": "XZ-1 Wins Out", "Author": "Z. Wagner", "ReviewID": "RTHLHYIL3P41M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my preliminary review for the Olympus XZ-1, which arrived at my house this afternoon.  I will update as necessary.Over the last two weeks, I have ordered, and returned, two other cameras: the Fujifilm HS20EXR, and the Panasonic LX5. Neither one of them really satisfied me in terms of a total package.  The build quality (at least on my copy) of the HS20 was suspect, and worried me a bit.  The RAW processing time was quite slow, and I guess I just didn't like the overall feel of it.  The Panasonic, despite all the rave reviews, did not satisfy in terms of IQ.  Color blotching crept in far too early (even as early as ISO 200) for my taste, and by ISO 400 it was unbearable.  The Jpeg processing on the LX5 wasn't great, either.  So I finally decided to order the Olympus after much reading and staring at sample images on the internet, though I was becoming skeptical it would be able to satisfy me.  At least so far, I was wrong.The Olympus XZ-1 is a marvel of technology.  From the blazing fast Zuiko lens to the quick and slick menu interface, to the conservative beauty of the design, this camera means business.  Shooting with the XZ-1 is an effortless joy, and it works so well and so intuitively at times that you almost forget you're using a camera at all.  I've read in other reviews that the rear control ring is finicky and annoying, but that is not my experience.  I find it to work quite well, with the right amount of tactile feedback.  The same is true of the front ring around the lens, used to control various settings based on the mode you are in.  Sure, there's not a dedicated button for ISO, but it's so easy to set the ISO from the menu that I'm not quite sure what the issue is.  The lack of an AFL/AEL button is a bit of a letdown, but I don't find it to be a dealbreaker by any means.The art filters range from quaint novelty effects that I will rarely use to things like the Dynamic Tone filter, which (though the effect is a bit hit or miss) can be incredibly striking.As far as all the other modes go, it's pretty much your standard fare, with the addition of the 'low light' mode.  But I wouldn't go too crazy with that mode, as the noise at higher ISOs from the XZ-1 is pretty pronounced.  And that leads me to image quality.For some reason, though the XZ-1 possesses quite a large sensor for a point-and-shoot, it produces quite a lot of noise.  What this creates is the necessity to find the right balance with your RAW processing between noise reduction and image clarity and sharpness.  Or, you can just use the Jpegs, which I must say, are very well processed, but when put up against the RAW files, can't compare to the detail, due to the noise reduction applied to the Jpegs.  This is the one bit of a bummer about the image quality of this camera.  You will see a decent amount of noise as low as ISO 400, though nothing that can't be dealt with in post until you pass 800.  1600 might be salvageable, but it's questionable.  The nice thing is that the noise is more luminance than color oriented, because I find it's more difficult (as with the LX5) to deal with large blotches of inappropriate color.  So, bad news dealt with.  And it's really not that bad, because guess what?  You've got one of the fastest lenses in a compact camera at your command.  This means that you will rarely need to jump above ISO 800 to shoot just about anything.  The speed of this lens is simply a marvel to behold, and a joy to employ.  Not only does it allow you much, much more freedom in ALL your shooting (aperture only hits 2.5 at telephoto, which is still faster than most dslr lenses are at wide!), but the size of the sensor in relation to the aperture capability of the lens also allows for some of the nicest bokeh you'll find in a compact.  Olympus also smartly employs an in-camera ND filter to help you keep those aperture numbers low whilst shooting in bright daylight, which is a godsend.And despite what I've said about the noise issue, the images from this camera are, in general, pretty spectacular.  This is no dslr, but the images are about as close as you'll get without buying one at this point.  While the noise reduction applied to the jpegs definitely reduces fine details, they still look spectacular.  The colors from this camera absolutely scream, and even if you're not fond of the detail loss in jpeg, just go for RAW shooting, which is still really, really fast.  Shot to shot times are very fast, seemingly regardless of the file type (though I am using a very fast Sandisk card as well).The continuous shooting speed of this camera isn't wonderful, but honestly, it's not bad when you consider that you can fire off quite a few pics (even with the images set at Fine Jpeg + RAW) before it gets stumped.  You can also reduce the quality of the Jpegs to 5MP to grab some more fps, and even down to 2MP to grab even more fps, but I certainly wouldn't go that low.Autofocus is generally good, though I did encounter some questionable choices when in macro mode that did annoy me a bit.  However, you can choose between 11 different focus points to get the pic you want, or hold the shutter button down halfway and recompose.  In general though, I found the autofocus to be reasonably fast and accurate thus far.One other caveat is that for some reason the Auto WB seems to have trouble with incandescent lighting, creating overly warm tones and forcing you to manual select the incandescent setting for accurate colors.  This is not a huge deal, but it's a bit of an annoyance.The LCD screen is gorgeous, and while I wish the camera came with an EVF, Olympus has given us the ability to add the VF-2 viewfinder, which is both a great and, unfortunately, incredibly expensive option.  I will be ordering the viewfinder, though I don't relish spending half the price of the camera on a tiny little accessory.I look forward to many glorious outings with the XZ-1, and can honestly say that I highly recommend it to anyone looking to move up from a simple point and shoot, but not yet ready to go full on with a dslr and a bunch of lenses.(UPDATE 1) Received my VF2 viewfinder today, and was able to try it out for a few hours before work.  WOW.  Talk about a quality product.  I was concerned about the cost (and really I still am), but you definitely get a great little add-on.  The picture is ultra clear and makes all other EVFs tremble before it.  Obviously using it in daylight is great, but for me, coming from a dslr background, just having it was a no-brainer.  And if I decide at some point to upgrade to the EPL2, I don't have to buy it again.  So that made it worth it to me.  Still loving the camera (even more with the viewfinder)!(UPDATE 2)  Man, I LOVE this camera.  The VF2 viewfinder has increased my enjoyment of it by quite a lot, and I honestly didn't think that was possible.  I could sit and nit-pick the image quality compared to dslr cameras, but it's just not worth it.  Upping the sharpness and contrast applied to the jpegs makes them usable straight out of the camera, as long as you keep the ISO reasonable (800 or lower).  Flipping the 'gradation' feature to auto can garner you better dynamic range in shadows as well as better detail, though you will experience more shadow noise, so use it wisely.I certainly didn't buy this camera for the art filters, just thought they'd be a fun little addition... but they really do help me with my creative picture taking, and get me thinking about things from a different perspective.  Highlights are the Grainy B&W; (allows for some interesting videos as well), Diorama!(I've come to LOVE this one), and of course the popular Dramatic Tone.  Soft Focus is useful as well for portraiture or weddings.  The super fast lens allows me to shoot at ISO100-200 most of the time, occasionally venturing to 400 and, much more rarely, to 800.  Also, make yourself take pics using the Monochrome setting.  Turn up the sharpness to +1 and the contrast to +2, and behold the beautiful B&W; photos this camera spits out.  Pretty awesome.Also great is the Macro and Super Macro.  I'm not the biggest fan of the tracking AF though, a sports camera this is not, though the continuous shot is pretty decent in the right situations.  Good for kids and such, but really fast movers like dogs can sometimes be problematic.  Pretty much forget birds, but the range of this lens doesn't really allow for that anyway.The bundled software is actually not bad either.  I'm used to using PSE, so I use that for most everything, but I do a simple distortion correction in the Viewer 2 software first, which works quite well (the lens has some decent barrel at wide, and a little pincushion at tele, nothing really problematic).All in all I can't say enough about this camera.  If you're on the fence, just buy it.  You can return it if you don't like it, but why would you do that?  Kudos, Olympus!", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A point & shoot that can be both serious and fun!", "Author": "D. Turkmen", "ReviewID": "RQJLZRF3AWKBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My girlfriend and I were tired of carrying all the DSLR gear with us whenever we go somewhere, so we started looking for  a lighter alternative. After reading some reviews and comparisons online (dpreview.com is a great source for that) we decided to buy Olympus XZ-1.Pros:- It has a bright f/1.8 lens which is pretty good at low-light situations (or just taking shallow pictures)- The screen has live view where you can see the depth of field in Aperture mode before taking the photo- OLED screen is bright enough to see in day light. It also isn't that power-hungry.- The big sensor can capture the subject in great details.- Anti-shake mechanism works pretty well. I tested 1/40, 1/25, even 1 second exposures which turned out better than I expected. With my DLSR's anti-shake off, those pics would be more blurry.- Charges through USB (this may be a con for you if you use card readers) simply keep your camera plugged in to your computer after transferring the images, and you don't have to take out the battery for charging anymore.- The dial around the lens is easy to use. Depending on the mode it changes aperture, shutter, scene mode; or rotates images.- 6 Art filters which applies digital effect to your photo/movie in realtime.- 18 Scene modes which will make taking any occasion easy. For example, \"pet\" will track the moving animal in the frame. Or \"panorama\" scene mode will help you take 3 consecutive images and stitch them together auto-magically.- Macro mode can focus even at the closest distance possible (be careful, your lens may be easily touching that flower!)- It fits in a pocket (maybe not jeans or shirt pockets)- (ADDED) Built-in ND filter lets you have longer exposures (1/10 seconds, for example) during day time. See the waterfall picture as an example.- (ADDED) Splash-proof. Used under heavy rain where water drops were all over the place (lens, dials, screen) with no problems.Cons:- Art and Scene modes are on the top dial along with P/A/S/M modes, so you cannot combine those (e.g. cannot apply an art filter while in Aperture Priority. But I guess some of those filters are meant to overwrite aperture/shutter)- Shutter lag is definitely noticeable if you are a DSLR user. If the timing is important, try sequential mode. Luckily there is even a hi-speed burst shooting mode.- The lens is too bright sometimes. Shutter speed cannot go faster than 1/2000s. In a bright day light at f/1.8, you'll start seeing overexposure and fringing. EDIT: With the built-in Natural Density Filter on, this is not the case anymore!- Some of the art filters need more processing power than others, which makes the screen (live view) refresh slower. For taking photos this is not a big deal. But if you record a movie that way, you will get lower frame rates. But again, this camera is not meant to replace your camcorder or your post processing software.- No viewfinder.- (ADDED) Lens cap is pretty lose. We ended up buying an after-market cap that fits  around the lens (you can see the threads if you look carefully) with spring-powered blades that will automatically open/close when lens is in/out. Edit: Looks like they have an official lens cap now Olympus LC-63A Lens Cap for XZ-1 Digital Camera- (ADDED) RAW version of the photo looks pretty dull comparing to JPEG. We had hard time editing the RAW to match the colors to the JPEG. It would have been nice if some color profile was provided with the camera.11/12/2012----------Camera is still working great. Bought a Sony RX-100, but it cannot just replace the XZ-1 yet. XZ-1 has great support (Olympus has released firmware v1.5 as of May 2012), and its low-light performance is among the best in P&S; class. Recent price drop ($199) brings this camera to a greater price/performance point.Couple months ago purchased an LCD remote, which works perfect in test environment but I couldn't test its durability in real world yet LCD Timer Remote TC-UC1 For Olympus XZ-1, E series. This is one of the 3 necessary accessories, other 2 being LC-63A Lens Cap, and a Gorillapod.

Best in class, with one exception...", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R7CQXAMK44NB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very much looking forward to this XZ-1 for a long time. Seemed to have the BEST of all the similar cameras in this category, put into ONE camera. I have owned the Canon S90, Samsung TL-500, and STILL own the LX5. All of these cameras are rather good and certainly way better than an average point and shoot, especially if you want a lot of control over the camera.The XZ-1 does have a rather amazing lens..in that it is very fast(bright) throughout it's entire range..impressive. It is true I found that being able to shoot with the 1.8 aperture in doors..I did not have to use a very high iso, yet the shutter speed was indeed faster than my LX5 with same settings for example.Faster shutter speed did result in mostly really good indoor pictures without the usual slow shutter blurriness, THOUGH all pics indoors in even rather good light tended to be a bit dark oddly enough until I cranked up exposure compensation.The image stabilization on the XZ-1 seems really WAY above average as well.HOWEVER doing a ton of side by side pics vs my LX5 or even JUST looking at the output of the XZ-1, jpeg pictures at default setting look \"somewhat\" soft, if you use the default Natural setting(With no adjustments as to sharpness, contrast etc.)! I mean even at iso100 my pictures look..too soft, airbrushed looking SLIGHTLY. In camera somewhat aggressive Noise reduction is that one exception I listed in the title.Living with his camera for a while it is obvious Olympus chose to use too much noise reduction at ALL isos!.But,the overall output in most cases is almost amazing for a camera in this class. There is just a bit of slight softness especially on skin especially now and then it seems. If I shoot raw..then take off, or lower the noise reduction, finally the pictures become MUCH more sharp. As you raise the iso..Olympus uses more and more noise reduction to it's jpegs as all manufacturers will do. Not uncommon, but now I find I'm almost always shooting in jpeg PLUS raw just to have the option to do away with so much UNNEEDED noise reduction which will cause smudging/smearing as iso rises above 200iso..some even at iso100. One may not notice this as much or AT all if you are shooting general scenery out doors. It's more noticeable I find on portrait work.You can check out the Comparometer at Imaging resource. Instead of just my OPINION,I replaced the . with a DOT so hopefully the link does not get deleted..[...]Put the XZ-1 on one side..put an S95/ TL500, LX5 or a G12 etc on the other. Check different ISOS and see if you don't agree the XZ-1 starts losing too much detail vs the other cameras 200iso and above. You will notice it most easily on the clothing, the threads become blurred vs most of the competition. Even the wall paint becomes much more blurred vs most of the other cameras DUE to noise reduction..However overall the jpegs from the XZ-1 are generally REALLY good with great looking color and the detail is not that bad, actually GOOD..but COULD be so much better with lower aggressive noise reduction..that's all I'm saying.Using raw..there is a ton of GOOD detail and not much noise in fairly good light till you get to about 400/500iso...if you want the VERY best out of this XZ-1Vs my LX5 the LX5 almost always has more detail AND noise, but most of the LX5's jpegs look sharper at same iso. HOWEVER OVERALL, the pics from the XZ-1 just LOOK WAY WAY better as to the WHOLE picture, dynamic range, IQ, almost no lens distortion, GREAT corner to corner sharpness, lack of purple fringing...nice rather accurate color overall..it beats the LX5 and my S90 that I owned.Bokeh (Blurred background) is amazing on this camera if that's important to you. I never knew a camera with a small sensor (compared to a full sized or micro four's sensor) could give you so much depth of field with that great blurred background.The battery life is above average.Video: I didn't do much video recording but what I did record looked VERY good.In summary in my opinion, At default picture JPEG setting vs an LX5, S95, or even the TL-500, I am finding the XZ-1 to be best in class (Except again..stronger overall noise reduction than all the others.)Each camera though in this category seems to have some strong points, some weaknesses.Use raw on the XZ-1 this camera looks REALLY really good and on balance, JUST may really be the best of the crop here.  Jpegs DO look VERY good too..just you will see night and day sharpness if you chose to shoot raw and take OFF the noise reduction, when you want that extra detail. Noise reduction can not be changed IN camera.Since owning and using this camera A LOT now..I feel confident in saying it's probably the best camera in this 10meg smallish pocketable category. I like this camera so much now I bumped it up to 5 stars from it's initial 4 star rating I gave it. If Olympus can include IN camera noise reduction adjustment, perhaps in a future firmware update this camera has no competition in this category in my opinion!", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video killed the Photograph Star - XZ-1 vs. LX5", "Author": "Stillness", "ReviewID": "R1R8C09NSX0IFC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My review of the XZ-1 is from the perspective of being proud father and the family member in charge of capturing memories (and a major geek).  Through the years, I have tried just about every type of camera from the Fujifilm F30 to the Canon ti2, the Lumix GF1, GH1 and so on.  My ideal camera is small enough to carry in a pocket (or in my case, a belt holster), has great low light capability, great video capability and some zoom capability.Many enthusiast compacts and all Micro 4/3 cameras like the GF1, PL2 and so forth, don't fit in a belt holster.  That leaves the S95, the LX5 and the XZ-1.  The S95 is out due to no video autofocus and slow min. aperture at telephoto.The XZ-1 fits in my hand better than the LX5 (more room for the fingers of my right hand w/o rubbing the lens barrel), and has a faster lens than the LX5 in a very meaningful and practical way.  At the same shutter speed the XZ-1 will be ISO 320 where the LX5 will be ISO 640.  At high and low ISO, the Olympus jpeg processing is much more pleasing to my eye than the LX5 (I don't have time to deal with RAW.)  I also prefer the XZ-1 28mm over the wider LX5 24mmBut I'm returning the XZ-1 and keeping the LX5 because the XZ-1 video quality is unacceptably poor.  The quality is so bad as to be distracting and useless for capturing family memories.  Not just the wild focus hunting which would be enough, the compression codec makes everything look soft, digital and just awful.  Anyone with a few years shooting AVCHD lite on these Lumix cameras like the old ZS3 will be heartbroken.  That's why I have to give 3 stars.If I didn't need video, the XZ-1 would be perfect.BTW if you're looking for a killer belt holster for your XZ-1 or LX5 the Lowepro Napoli 30 is a perfectly snug fit and you won't need the lens cover anymore.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Olympus XZ-1", "Author": "Tariq A Khasawinah", "ReviewID": "RFE0GIAKKYIOO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera extensively on a recent trip overseas.  My previous cameras include a Nikon D40 (using a nikkor 50mm 1.4g and sigma 150mm 2.8 prime lenses) and a canon P&S.;  This camera is a pleasure to use, the pics r usually sharp (depending on the ambient light and being able to squeeze the trigger without shaking), the macro is awesome, and the bokeh (with the wide lens aperture u actually get decent bokeh which is totally cutting edge for a P&S;) is great.  Your subjects will also love the soft focus mode which gives them perfectly smooth skin (just like the model shots).  I prefer this camera over my DSLR, especially for travelling as it is obviously easier to carry this around everywhere rather than lugging around a DSLR with multiple lenses. The video, however, is mediocre.  Overall, I highly recommend this camera and believe that this currently is the best P&S; camera for pictures only. For those into video, you will still need a dedicated camcorder if you also want top notch home videos.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "One of the best P&S; cameras", "Author": "mister_t42", "ReviewID": "REONU0N76I0PO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owened a series of P&S; (point & shoot) cameras since selling my digital SLR a few years ago.  I just didnt like dragging around a large camera with multiple lenses when I could have a small pocket camera that took decent photos.  But I was never quite satisfied with any of the small cameras I tried (a combination of Canons and Panasonics).  Until I bought my 5th one, the Olympus XZ-1.Quite simply, the lense in the XZ-1 is spectacular.  It lets in a lot of light, and combined with a larger than typical sensor (compared to other P&S;) you really can get terrific photos in a wide variety of settings.  This combination of lense and sensor is key, as it really ups the end result in a way that matters -- better quality photos.I took photos of an ice skating show recently and was shocked by how many great photos I got under very poor lighting, all without using flash.  The XZ-1 focuses rapidly, and it does a great job of automatically setting aperature and shutter speed.  Of course it does offer the user a fair amount control with its various modes, including shutter priority, aperature priority, and several more artistic modes.My only disappintment is that I wish it had a longer lens, say extending to 200mm (equivalent 35mm).  Now that is likely not possible given how open the lens aperature is, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I know, kind of greedy.Overall, a great point and shoot camera.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera is a joy to use.", "Author": "J. H. Smith", "ReviewID": "R1IHC8N2LEFN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The XZ-1 is a terrific camera, one tat meets my expectations since the mockup of the camera was shown last fall at Photokina.  I have previously owned a Panasonic LX3 (since upgraded to the LX5) and also own a Canon S90 (since upgraded to the S95), so I feel qualified that I can objectively compare the Olympus XZ-1 to those two cameras in the same premium fixed-lens genre.  I have had the XZ-1 for over a week and have taken dozens of photos with it so far.  The photo quality of the XZ-1 is excellent!  Photos have nice color and most camera controls are very intuitive.  I especially like the built-in neutral density filter that is easy to toggle on and off.  The menu system is more simplified that both the Panasonic and Canon, which while lacking some in-depth customization functions is very easy to navigate - another nice feature is that the camera remembers what function you last used, a very handy time saver.  The panoramic picture mode is simple to use and works far better than the Canon's stitch assist mode.  The front control ring around the lens is taken from the S90 but both it and the rear control dial operate far better than on the S90.  I have yet to use video so cannot comment on that though the dedicated video start/stop button seems convenient.  The size of the camera is more in line with the LX3/LX5 than the S90/S95; this is not a bad thing as the S90 is very compact yet also more difficult to hold (even with an aftermarket grip added to the S90 I am always fearful of dropping it due to its size and my fingers are usually in the way of its motorized flash).  As for quibbles: manual focus on the XZ-1 is via an enlarged screen box that would benefit greatly by the addition of a distance scale; also it would be nice if the camera shipped with an AC battery charger in addition to the USB charger (I have already ordered the Olympus AC charger and a spare battery).  Overall I am very pleased with the XZ-1's image quality and ease of use.Update:  I have had this camera for two months now and have taken hundreds of photos with it so thought I should update my review based on usage experience.The Good: Camera is well built and shows no wear, macro shots are terrific, lens is very good, JPEG colors are good and pleasing to the eye, outdoor daylight shots are generally quite acceptable, controls are fairly straight forward, like the built-in ND filter a lot.The Bad: As many others have stated the noise, especially in low light shots, is noticeable and sometimes downright unacceptable.  I hope Olympus addresses the noise issue in a firmware update soon; manual focus mode is not that useful because there is no distance scale and trying to focus with the scroll wheel and an enlarged box on the screen is not very easy - especially in bright outdoor lighting.Other: Have yet to find a decent case for it that is not too large or too snug a fit.  I tried a Tamrac Digital II case but it was a good deal larger than the camera which kind of defeats the point of carrying a premium compact camera, also tried a Lowepro Dublin 30, but that case is thin and not rigid enough to easily slide the camera into.  Ended up ordering a leather case off eBay from Hong Kong - at $11 bucks including shipping its not a bad deal, however the case is still about a half inch wider than it needs to be, but it is much better than the other two cases I tried.  Based on some reviews of other users I think I will try some shots saved in RAW and JPEG to see if it is worth the hassle of adjusting the RAW photos to reduce noise in low light shots.Based on the noise issue in low light and not terribly useful manual focus I think 4.5 stars in more appropriate for this camera.  My dream camera is something like the XZ-1 in terms of size and lens specification with an APS-C sized sensor.  Olympus please make one for me.  In the interim how about a firmware update for less noise in low light and a manual focus scale.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Finally a pocketable companion to a DSLR", "Author": "Jay A. Frogel", "ReviewID": "R24IO73NUCBAD1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I used film cameras an Olympus XA always went with me for many years as a near perfect complement to Nikon F2s, F4s, and F100s.  The XA used the same film, produced images that were almost as sharp as the larger cameras even when printed on Cibachrome 11 x 14 inch paper, and with its clamshell design was perfectly pocketable.  Since I switched to the D300 two years ago I have been at sea.  I tried an earlier Olympus clamshell digital P and S but it only did jpgs.  Then a switched to a Canon Power shot (or something like that) whcih was certainly compact - fitting in my shirt pocket, but again only jpgs.  Great for 4x6 and even 7 x 11 'tho not with the sharpness of D300 prints of the same size.  And not a clamshell design.  I borrowed a friends Panasonic (predecessor to the LX5).  It was ok but didn't \"feel\" the same as an XA.  Sharpness seemed ok.  Last week or so I read the review of the Olympus XZ-1 on dpreview.  It sounded very appealing.  More than that the comparisons (technical with the two competing models by Canon and Panasonic) showed that the Olympus bested them in terms of image quality for RAW (I will not use jpgs on this camera).  The G12 was a consideration but too clunky - not a reborn XA.  Ditto for the Nikon equivalent (coolpix 7000?).  My local Penn Camera shop had 1 (ONE) so I went down to there to handle it.  It felt great, was compact, fast, bright, etc.  So I bought it.I have taken only a few dozen images with it just to get used to it before going on a trip, so rather than expounding on issues much better dealt with in the dpreview coverage, I'll just give my impressions pros and cons.1. Very fast lens and all focal lenghts.  EAsily beats competition.2. A real wheel that you turn for f/stop in Aperture priority mode.  ditto for shutter priority.3. Amazingly bright screen - comparable to the D3004. Pocketable (but see below)5.  Intuitive arragement of controls and options - at least for people who've used small cameras before.6.  Big RAW images.7.  dpreview complains about small video frames.  For me this is irrelevant so readers of this review need to weigh this.8.  Very acceptable zoom range (the XA was fixed focal length).9.  Not concerned overly with burst rate since I'll use my D300 if I need to (ditto for the XA vs. F100 comparison).10.

 or i may have defective flash?as far as picture quality goes, i compared a picture i took with this vs. my good old canon G6, all with default settings and A mode.  it was a shot of my son in the dining room during the day.  the picture from my G6 is slightly more \"blue-ish\" as supposed to the XZ-1's being slightly more \"red-ish\".  individually, they looked perfectly okay, though in contrast, the difference is apparent. i would say the true color falls somewhere in between the two.  more comparisons are to be done...", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Magnificent camera", "Author": "14carbonman", "ReviewID": "RFSBQU9S76EBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera certainly lives up to its excellent reviews, being responsive, flexible yet easy to use, and taking great pictures.

When I am on my own downtime, traveling or with family, I loathe dragging a DSLR with multiple lenses and accessories.  But yet I feel restricted with most pocketable point-and-shoot compact cameras.  They are just too limiting for things my creative urge wants me to do.  Fortunately in the past couple of years there has emerged a relatively new class of pocketable camera that is small enough to take anywhere but offers decent manual controls and respectable quality.  Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Sony and others all have great bridge cameras between $500 - $700.So let's get this out of the way immediately ... at the current retail price of $499 ($399 street price) for the Olympus XZ-1 it is a serious contender.  At Amazon's Black Friday price of $199 it is an absolute no-brainer.  While at twice the price I may have had a couple of \"if only's\", at the Black Friday selling price it is without any doubt THE best overall camera in its price range ... bar none.  And no this is not an ad, I have never worked for Olympus in any way, and this is the first of their cameras I have ever owned.Because I bought this as my personal fun camera I will stay away from any techie talk and tell you what can help you make an informed buying decision.  There are several excellent technical reviews online, including the dpreview link at the top of this page.  I also won't compare it with other cameras that I don't own or brands that I think are \"better or worse\".  I'm reviewing something that I own and use.- I don't think it's possible to find a camera with more of a solid, quality build for anywhere near the price.  Be aware this is NOT as ultra-slim as some other cameras in its class.  Personally I would never put it in any pocket, more like a belt case.- Best-in-class features include a superb Zuiko lens with a largest aperture in its zoom range of F:1.8 - 2.5.  A couple of new cameras are being introduced with a largest  aperture of F:1.8 but to top off at maximum zoom at F:2.5 is unheard of anywhere near this price range.  The camera's smallest aperture is a useful F:8.0- For the millionth time in my career, more megapixels does NOT necessarily make a better picture.  Olympus is making a huge statement for that by matching their larger than average sensor to a respectable 10 MP to result in a camera with simply amazing low-light performance and superb resolution, without resorting to excess unnatural electronic processing.  If you haven't already done so, you would be well served to do some research about the topic of megapixels.  There is consensus that 6 MP was the necessary sweet-spot and anything above that for 95% of users has little impact on \"making a better picture\" only an extreme enlargement (like 24 x 36) which a fraction of one percent of people actually do.- The lens ring, which several other brands now have, is in my estimation the best of class.  It defaults to the most appropriate usage for each dial-mode setting.  For example, in the program mode (where you let the camera make most of the decisions, the dial defaults to ISO setting, which is at that point the most important decision I want to make myself).  If you prefer using the fully automatic setting, Olympus thoughtfully gives you a very decent range of simplistic personal override settings to tweak what the camera chooses to do.  The logical use of the lens ring for every other mode always ends up being the perfect choice.  I tried other cameras that let you assign what function the lens ring performs and it is a pain to have to remember what you assigned.  The lens ring also has the best \"feel\" to it of any camera that has one.- The mode dial is much more like a DSLR than a compact camera.  All of the right functions are there and nothing more.  Trust me, when you actually own this camera you will find yourself using manual controls much more than you do with most other point & shoot cameras.- The lens cap is controversial.  I have my opinion.  The leaf cover most other brands use is the #1 most vulnerable component of a compact camera.  Once it breaks you are hosed.  While the old-school plastic lens cap seems like an anachronism, it really is a better solution.  It is held on to the lens barrel by simple friction and the motion of the lens extending pops it off automatically. If \"losing it\" is one of your major fears, buy a dozen of them, they are extremely cheap.  I use the included tether to keep it from getting lost, so problem solved.- The 3\" OLED viewfinder screen is awesome.- The owner's manual is not.  It is an embarrassment to a camera that was meant to sell for $500. There are menu options that defy logic and they deserve a better manual to explain them.-  Like the camera's manual, the software documentation is virtually non-existent.  On the topic of software, I don't recall ever using software that took so long to install.  And then before letting me use it, it forced me through about 6 software/firmware updates.  The total time to install the software was about 2.5 hours.- The iB software, however, is superb.  For the first time ever with a Point & Shoot I am shooting everything as jpg+raw.  The image out-of-camera requires very little post-processing, but the option of \"going back and doing it again\" with the raw image using iB means I will probably rarely if ever drag my DSLR equipment along again on a fun/family outing.- The accessory shoe is unheard of at Amazon's current selling price, making the XZ-1 one of the most ideal bridge cameras out there.- I happen to like the dedicated movie button, although I will rarely use the camera for movies.  Just one more thing to get off the mode dial but \"be there\" if that priceless moment comes along that you need to capture on video.  Video quality is usable, but this is a still camera.  I fail to see why a few users downgraded a camera they say they love because the video quality isn't perfect.  If video quality is so important it's probably best to get a dedicated video camera for your needs.- The menu system is an important part of any digital camera.  Unlike old school film cameras which had a few dedicated controls to handle basic photography adjustments, almost all digital cameras have a plethora of controls.  Having control over your camera is useful when you have the opportunity to take the time to compose and adjust for the perfect shot, and that tends to describe the function of a DSLR.  Point & Shoots on the other hand are designed to capture the rare candid moment in which you only have a split second to frame and press the shutter button.  So many of the current P&S; camera tend to lean toward \"the camera does it all\" or the other extreme in which the photographer has dozens of setting options, often buried deep within menus upon menus.  The initial reaction to the XZ-1 is actually a little frustrating in that so many settings I was familiar with on \"lesser\" P&S; cameras simply were not there.  My first impression was that I felt too limited.  It really takes a while to get used to Olympus' menus, so much so that in the first week I did a full reset several times because I felt like I was backed into a corner and couldn't set the camera the way I wanted.  That's when I discovered the brilliance of the \"custom\" position on the mode dial and of setting most of the other mode settings at their default setting.  As I alluded to earlier, the mode dial will probably be used by me (and maybe you) far more often than you are used to on most digital cameras.- Nitpicks: I don't care much for the shape of the shutter release button.  Olympus went for style over function here and its flat shape makes slightly difficult to locate your finger on it without searching.  The detents on the mode dial could be just a little stronger.  No handgrip but I wrap the neckstrap around my hand anyway.  I'm not crazy about zoom levers around the shutter release but they seem to be popular.- Little niceties:  The supplied strap is soft and has nice non-slip texture.  Possible to program playback button as on/off switch.  All buttons except shutter have exact same tactile feel to them.  Metal door over inputs/outputs.  Metal tripod screw.  Positive detent at halfway point on shutter button.  Ridge around video button so not easy to press accidentally.  Positive lock for battery/SD card door.  Hangs level from your neck/shoulder (yes this is something positive).- Hint:  If you own/buy one of these, the best way to turn the rear control dial is by using the fingernail on your forefinger.  If you instinctively use your fingertip or thumb it is hard not to press the directional button.  I like this control but it is way small and after I discovered the fingernail trick it was much happier with it.So, what about the bottom line, what kind of pictures does it take?  I've always preached that cameras take pictures, photographers take photographs, and that the hardware is a minor part of the creative process.  This is especially true in a point & shoot. But on the other hand, a well-designed camera does allow you to best express your creativity.  As a pro, my conclusion is that I doubt if any current compact camera will give you more capability to take better photos than the XZ-1.  Its design simply has no significant limitations to your capabilities to take the most basic of snapshots and have them look good, or to have a pocketable compact camera give you the flexibility to not feel bad you left your DSLR at home.I take a lot of photos indoors or at night.  The larger sensor coupled with a low light CCD and fast lens is the #1 reason I chose this model (the Black Friday deal being a close second).  While it doesn't perform magic, I am blown away by what it can do in challenging low-light situations without resorting to an unusable high ISO or too low of a shutter speed.  My first test shot was taken after sunset of the entrance to a restaurant.  Using the low-light setting on the mode dial the camera auto-selected F:2.3, ISO 400 with a shutter speed of 1/40, certainly a usable handheld speed.  My eye told me at that aperture and ISO I should not have been able to take the shot handheld.Good compact camera prices are not coming down; in fact many of the good ones now cost as much as an entry-level DSLR.  I think it will be a very long time before we see a significantly more capable camera than the XZ-1, and after this deal is over I'm not sure if we will ever see one for under $200.So, should you consider it?  Consider this, the replacement has already been announced, the XZ-2.  The \"differences\" are extremely subtle ... a little screw-on handgrip, a lever that makes the lens ring clickable or smooth-turning, a CMOS instead of CCD sensor (both have pros and cons), and a tiltable LCD (although apparently it is no longer an OLED).  Otherwise the camera is identical, including the exact same lens.  The announced retail price is $600.  Once the price deal is over and the XZ-1's are gone, if you want this camera it will cost $400 more for the same thing with some minor tweaks.  Remember I am reviewing the XZ-1 for its value/performance at the current price ... if we were talking about $600 cameras it would be a whole new ball game.[EDIT] The day after I wrote this the Black Friday deal ended and the XZ-1 price has been unstable but seems to continue to go up. Also, there are several additional comments attached to this review about the camera and accessories.

Potential Customers need a compelling reason to spend hundreds of dollars to buy something they may already have built into their phone.A genre of cameras commonly called \"premium compact cameras\" has emerged.  These cameras traditionally were priced in the $300-$500 range, have sensors a little larger than the usual compact camera sensor, have full manual controls and a bright maximum aperture.  They vary a bit in size from the smallest (Canon S90/95/100 series) to a little larger (LX3/LX5 series; Olympus XZ-1) to pretty big and chunky (Canon G Series).  As 1\"+ sensors are now finding their way into smallish cameras (Olympus PEN series especially the E-PM1; Nikon J series, Sony NEX series, etc) this category is becoming blurred.  Most recently, Sony has redefined the entire concept of a premium compact camera by somehow squeezing a 1\" sensor inside a really small camera (see my Amazon review of the Sony RX-100).The Olympus XZ-1 is the best of the premium compact cameras in its price range.  It does almost everything right.  It has a maximum aperture of f/1.8 at the wide end and still a very bright f/2.5 at the telephoto end.  It has a very usable 28mm-112mm equivalent zoom range with a big/bright LCD screen.  Most importantly, photographs taken under almost all lighting conditions are excellent (as long as you don't stray above ISO 400).  10MP is a sensible choice for a small sensor camera.  Automatic White Balance, metering, color saturation all are spot on accurate.  There is a hot shoe for an external flash (The FL-300 is a great/small external flash with bounce capability) and full manual controls.High ISO performance is not very good (there is still a small sensor after all) but the fast apertures go a long way to avoid going into that territory.Although the specifications of this camera are similar to the Panasonic LX5, the Olympus simply takes much better photographs.  The Canon G Series is more solidly built (although the XZ-1 is no slouch in the build department) and has an optical viewfinder and more controls. However, one can not compare the G Series Image quality (I am not including the $700 G-1X here) to the Olympus XZ-1 either in good or dim lighting.  The XZ-1 is just that much better.How can Olympus make this camera even better?  Perhaps a larger sensor to boost high ISO performance like the Sony RX-100; also an optical viewfinder like the Canon G series (and the classic Olympus C series of yesteryear) would be great; also including a built in lens cap like the Canon offerings (or even a snap on cap that actually fits like the LX5); adding some kind of rubber grip; improving the macro shooting quality as it is now \"hit or miss\" and including an external battery charger (the battery must be charged while inside the camera; after market external chargers are available for a few dollars).If you are looking for an affordable, smallish camera that takes great photographs in most lighting conditions with full manual controls and a hot shoe for an external flash, this camera is the best available.

As a former pro, and a P/T pro now, I can attest to the top-notch quality of Zuiko glass.  I have a whole gaggle of old yet fast OM system glass that I still use on my 25-year-old OM4t, as well as adapters that allow me to use this glass on my E-3s and m4/3 cameras.  In addition I have many of the high and mid-level dust and weather-sealed pro-grade digital Zuikos like the 7-14, 12-60 SWD, 50 F2 macro, and 50-200 SWD.Well, the i.Zuiko glass in the XZ-1 is right up there with its pro-level siblings.  Clear, precise, nice contrast, tack-sharpness, at all focal lengths, and only stops down to F2.5 at full reach of 112mm for silky bokeh.  Zoom works quietly and efficiently.  RAWs are easy to work with, and the jpegs are near-perfect in WB and snappy GORGEOUS color reproduction (something Olympus excels at, are you taking note Panasonic?)  Very good IQ and dynamic range for a small-sensor P&S.;  Very little shutter lag, quick to respond.  Macro focusing works like it should.  And with the VF-2 EVF, it's even more fun, because that is one sweet high-res viewfinder!My only concern was that in very bright light (for example sun reflecting on snow) there is sensor bloom at focus lock across the entire OLED and in the EVF, where it'll turn pink-purple at focus lock.  But Olympus said this is normal, and my camera sales guy confirmed that with bright aperture glass like this, you can expect some bloom in bright light, esp. with the ND filter activated (BTW, another big plus).  As long as the pink and purple don't make it to the final product, you're fine.Menu system took a little getting used to, because there are only a couple pages in the main camera menu for each function.  Most of the day-to-day functions are accomplished using the two dials, the one in front around the lens and the other in back.  You'll get used to them, as I did.  Normally I can take pics with a camera and understand its functions in 1/2 hour, with this one it took 45 minutes and a quick visit to the manual (on disk).Build quality seems good, and the OLED monitor is a joy to look at.  All in all, a decent little camera with a bright and sharp lens and outstanding jpeg processing that makes the grade.  Without the EVF, it is DEF pocketable....Don't let the fact that it's only 10.1 MP scare you off.  That seems to be just right for this sensor, which is the same one used in the Panny Lumix LX5 (and both share the same Venus Processor.)  Shots above ISO 800, however, do show some noise; if U go above 800, shoot raw and that will help some.  But the cool thing about this baby is the bright lens allows you to shoot at lower ISOs when possible, so there is a trade-off that works.And one more bonus, especially for those of you with Olympus FL-50R and 36R flashes: the XZ-1's flash will fire them remotely as a slave trigger, similar to what the $1500 E-5 (and older E-3s) do.  Olympus strobists rejoice!Cons are very few: no dedicated battery charger (USB only), flimsy USB/AV door, no grip on the left side.  However, it is so diminutive, you get used to holding it under the front ring and on the side.  And the video is terrible, so don't buy this camera for its video.  There are others out there, like the LX5, that do MUCH better at video.All in all, a nice little compact camera with outstanding fast and bright Zuiko glass that takes great raw and stunningly beautiful jpegs--just don't get it for video, and understand that extremely high ISO (1600+) is not a good idea.

Kniffen", "ReviewID": "R3UTFZR33900HZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not to use hyperbole, but I would submit that this is one of the best small-body cameras currently on the market. But first... a bit of background.I upgraded from a Nikon point-n-shoot to a Sony NEX-3 with the 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 kit lens in January 2011... the NEX-3 was my first experience with an APS-C (i.e.; SLR-sized) sensor, and the image quality was absolutely astounding. I absolutely cannot fault Sony at all for the build quality on the body and lens--I've held \"normal\" dSLR kits that didn't feel nearly as sturdy and well-made. HOWEVER (and this was a deal-breaker), it didn't have enough buttons. If I wasn't making many adjustments to exposure compensation, ISO, aperture, etc. then it was a breeze to use... but once I started to get more comfortable with the camera and playing with more settings the lack of buttons really slowed down its operation. I sadly parted with the NEX-3 (thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy) and started my search for a replacement.In case you didn't figure this out, I love buttons and dials on a camera--the more the better. The XZ-1 is fairly unique in the camera market because of the aperture ring around the lens. This is probably the single-best feature on this camera, aside from the crazy-fast lens. Obviously it fits in the barely pocketable size category, but it is still pocketable in a good-sized cargo pocket. Once you go menu diving to increase the JPEG sharpness the image quality is almost indistinguishable in good lighting conditions from the NEX-3. Sadly it's a compact camera, which means any ISO above 800 is effectively unusable. As long as you can keep your shutter speed to within reason without jacking up ISO, it's a phenominal camera. I took it on a 3-day trip to Washington D.C. for 4th of July and got great pictures in museums, Arlington cemetery, and even excellent hand-held fireworks shots. Obviously it's no SLR, but once you learn how to use it this camera cannot be beaten in the compact sector.

Takes sharp, clear photographs and really works great in low light.  It does have some serious problems though that prevent me from giving it five stars.  First, the lens cap is useless.  A camera like this, which boasts an Olympus Zuiko 1.8 lens, should have a threaded lens so you can attach a protective filter.  It does not.  In addition to that, the lens cap provided with the camera is worthless.  The second problem is that the camera has no grip at all.  It is very hard to hold.  Also, the mode dial should have deep, positive click stops to it.  As it is, when placed in your pocket, the mode dial can easily be moved accidentally.  While the battery provides power for plenty of photos, more battery power would be nice as well.  Aside from those flaws, this is an outstanding camera.  I use a 32 GB class 10 SDHC card and this camera is blazing fast.  The sequence mode is amazing, zoom is fast, focus is great, exposure comp, metering modes, and all the other settings work very well, allowing you to take the photo you want in virtually any condition.  Focus is fast, sharp, and accurate.  The occasional blurry image is due to me and not the camera.  I am used to taking photos with my Olympus OM-2N's, OM-4's, and OM-4T's, all with attached power bounce grips and winders.  Maybe that is why this camera is hard for me to get a grip on.  I solved the problem by ordering the Olympus FLBK01 flash bracket, the Olympus FLCB02 cord, and the Olympus FL-50R flash all from Amazon.  Now I get a great grip on this camera and the FL-50R flash syncs perfectly with the XZ-1 and produces amazing photos, far better than with the built in flash.  The built in flash is fine, but doesn't provide the range I'm used to.  Also, by using the flash attached to the grip I eliminated the red eye problem.  Now, I'm comparing a small point and shoot camera to my professional film SLR's and I know that's not fair.  But this is an amazing combination.  I posted some photos of this set up here at Amazon.  I solved the lens cap problem by purchasing the JJC auto lens cap here on Amazon and that works great on this camera.  The viewing screen on the back is beautiful, but in the bright sun you can't see much of anything.  The build quality of this camera is very good.  For the money you can not beat this camera.

(The Sigma DP cameras meet this requirement but are a pain to use and lack zoom lenses).  The Sony RX-100 isn't bad but my expectations were so high, I ended up returning it because it was good, not great.  So that's where I am coming from.  However, if you are looking to replace a compact camera with a better one, the XZ-1 is an excellent choice now that the price is down following the introduction of the XZ-2.  The area where the XZ-1 excels is the lens, but not for the reason that is constantly mentioned.  Yes, it is a fast lens and that's good.  But what almost goes unmentioned is that it is a sharp lens, even in the corners. even at wide angle.  This not the case with the LX5 or the S95/100 and there is no software that will correct for mushy corners.Of course, everyone's needs are different.  For example, the XZ-1 won't fit in a pocket the way the Canons will so that might be the deciding factor.  The LX-5 has a beautiful metal body whereas the XZ-1 is plastic.  Some people obsess over the lens cap, and so on.XZ-1 Plusses:  Faster and sharper lens than LX5 or S95, great default colors, simple yet versatile controls.  Minuses:  Lots of noise above ISO 200 (same as other cameras with this size sensor, actually slightly worse), clips (blows out) highlights terribly (same with other cameras with this size sensor), plastic construction, made in China, no viewfinder unless you go for the electronic which makes the camera too expensive, in my opinion.To sum up, at $300 it's simply superior to the Canon or the Lumix, at least in terms of output for still photos.  No idea about video.  For the $600 they're supposedly getting for the XZ-2, either the Fuji X10 or the Sony RX100 is a better choice.  The Sony has a much larger sensor and captures more detail with much less noise; the Fuji can handle highlights without blowing them out (the only compact camera to do so) so it's a good choice for high contrast applications like night photography.I really enjoyed using the XZ-1 and in the center, it beat my X10 for sharpness (although it wasn't quite as good in the corners).  But I had forgotten what a great job the Fuji cameras do with holding detail in the highlights so I guess I'll stick with the X10.  Since none of these cameras is really that spectacular, if I was starting over, I'd get the XZ-1 and save the extra cost of the X10.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you can't take good picture with this, then it's you", "Author": "steveclay52", "ReviewID": "RLQKARMVWAFT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have lived with this camera for a month now--I did a LOT of research before deciding to buy this camera.

I enjoy shooting with the PEN but its still not quite small enough to pocket in most cases.I've been struggling to find a pocket sized digital camera I \"liked\" and was happy with the image quality.  A dozen pocket cameras over ten years and I've never been happy with the consistency or controls on any of them.I've finally found one that is both a lot of fun to shoot with and for outdoor photography it's hard to tell what was shot on my 60D and what was shot on this camera.First off the lens and image quality.  The only disappointment for me is that the minimum aperture of the lens is only F8.  Granted, the lens is so sharp F8 looks about the same as F13 on my PEN which is saying something... Plus with the built in software based ND Filter.The lens goes down to F 1.8-2.5 which is as fast as any glass I own for the SLR.  Granted, a pocket camera DOES handle light a lot differently then an SLR or even Mirrorless system camera; but it lets in a lot more light even stopped down then any other pocket camera I've ever owned.From F4-F8 the lens is tact sharp with very little distortion that I can see. I don't see any real \"blurring\" or artifacting on the edges in this range at all.  It also handles Chromatic Aberation better then a number of my lenses for my Canon SLR.It handles ISO about equivalent to my old Rebel XTi.  Which means, yes the 60D blows it out of the water.  That said, that its on par with ANY SLR as a pocket camera is impressive.  The camera has no noticeable noise from ISO 100-160 and is easily correctable from 200-800.  Anything past ISO 1600 is pushing it.Compared to most pocket cameras, where I flinch at anything over ISO 200; even then the sharpness just isn't there.Build quality its solid.  Metal casing but much lighter then the PEN.  Comfortably fits into one hand between shooting where the PEN is heavy enough it needs the neck strap to be comfortable.Control wheel on the front is a joy to have and use, and while its only fully customizable what it does in the Custom mode; the context sensitive makes sense.  I actually don't mind shooting in P since its easy to change the ISO with the wheel.  I'm used to changing the ISO through the menus otherwise, which is nearly identical in operation to the EPL-2.Bought this Refurbished because I couldn't justify its original price tag of $499 for a pocket camera.  Hands down the best digital pocket camera Olympus has ever made.  Wish it were still in production and almost tempted to buy a spare just in case it breaks or I wear it out...I'm not impressed by its successor as its a much bigger camera in all aspects, especially width.  With the fold out screen you might as well just get a PEN, the body is just about the same weight and width; there really is no difference.It has its limitations.  Its still a pocket camera.  It doesn't have the zoom or versatility of an interchangeable lens system camera for sure. It doesn't handle noise as well either but it blows every other pocket camera I've touched out of the water for it. It's not as fast as an SLR for focusing but its still plenty snappy.I won't be selling my 60D nor Olympus PEN but the XZ-1 makes a respectable addition to the family. It's got a home for as long as it lasts. I'm not ashamed to post photos taken on this camera with the rest of my gallery; and its spot on consistent.

I suspected the price reduction was because a newer version was coming out and I was correct. Olympus is introducing an XZ-2 model that will have a 12 MP image size and more features. However the newer model will also cost substantially more. So if you are the sort of person interested in the latest and greatest, buy the XZ-2. If you are more concerned with getting a great camera for a great price, buy the XZ-1 (while it is still available).I am very impressed overall with this camera. I am especially fond of the macro images you can take. With the built in ND filter, you can open the aperture to f1.8 in daylight which results in a very pleasing bokeh. With the ability to shoot RAW, jpeg or both you can select what mode works best for you. The built-in art filters affect the jpeg images, but not the RAW images so you are losing nothing.Looking at the images at 100% view in Photoshop, I was impressed with the quality of the resolution. It may be only 10 MP, but you should still be able to make fairly large prints with no loss of image quality.All in all, you would have to buy a semi-pro grade DSLR to get better image quality.

I'm a pretty fair amateur photographer.  By far my favorite subject is people so I typically have a 50mm lense on one of my 8 film slr bodies (Minolta and Pentax both auto and manual focus).  But I do also carry a Nikon D70 and Nikon D50 which are both great cameras.  But As far as carrying any of these to a casual outing they are all too heavy and cumbersome (except for the MF and those don't do well at catching kids playing).  I was looking for an alternative to carrying around an SLR for everyday shooting of kids and vacations and what not, but I had three reservations about this camera; focus speed, video quality, and most importantly image/color quality.As for the first issue, this camera is pretty dang fast for a \"compact\" camera.  I was able to focus and shoot 8 to 10 single images of my daughter running around in the park in just a couple of seconds and only one of them was out of focus and that could just as easily been me and not the camera.  As for the video quality I will say up front we do not carry a video camera on a normal basis so I don't have much to compare with, but for the occasional video of my kids playing at the park or a quick birthday candle blow out this will definitely do the trick.  The nice thing is that even though it only records in 720p, it will upscale on the output to 1080i so I can still play it on my HD TV and it looks pretty good as long as I use the mini HD connection.Note:  output from the AV connector in the box is pretty horrible so don't judge by that.  If you use a mini HD the jpegs look almost film quality even on a 50 in TV.The third point I would really like to make is that I use professional quality film (Kodak 400UC that is no longer sold ... of course) and the color replication of that film is unparalleled.  Unless you want to spend hours post process (which I don't).  This camera comes as close as I have seen to replicating the same colors straight out of the camera.  In addition the images are sharp and the clarity is outstanding.My only con is the telephoto reach ... which is honestly a minor nit considering that F1.8 lens is still at F2.5 even at the 112mm lenght.  That's pretty impressive.If you are a person who normally carries a DSLR/SLR but don't want to lug one around all the time.

My Nikon D-90 with the 18-200 VR lens was the perfect choice for an Alaska cruise.  The Canon elph-300-hs was the perfect shirt pocket camera to take to conferences in New York, Chicago, and at home in Los Angeles.  My early experience with the Canon Power Shot A620 was perfect for a cruise in the Mediterranean.  And my Fujifilm F-30 and later my F-40fd taught me the advantages of a faster camera that can take indoor photographs without flash.  I also have the Panasonic GF-1 with the 20mm pancake lens.  That particular combination -- especially that superb lens -- takes superb pictures and is my favorite \"walk around\" camera.However, on the premise that the best camera is the one with you, and with the knowledge that I don't like lugging around a heavy body and a lot of lenses, but also want something that feels steady in my hands, I turned to the Olympus xz-1.  Along with my GF-1 it has become my favorite camera, and the one I now take on all trips (except perhaps those that demand a really long lens).I thought long and hard considering the Olympus xz-1 versus the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LXS-5.  Each one is worthy.  The Panasonic has a wider lens -- something I value greatly.  But the Olympus has the faster lens, and I really do not like using flash.  The Panasonic is about $120 or so cheaper, and that was very tempting.  The other contender -- the Canon S95 is even less than the Panasonic by about another $30 or so and is smaller, but I didn't think the image quality was as good.Why did I end up with the Olympus xz-1?  The lens is great.  The lens is very fast.  The movie function is excellent.  Image quality is superb.  It is just the right size -- if I want I can use a strap and carry it around my neck with very little weight, but I chose to use one that went around my wrist.  It easily fit in a belt pouch and I like to have my hands free when not shooting.My photographs were superior to those taken by my 30 year old daughter who used an Olympus 5010 on a recent 16 day trip to the Middle East (Jordan and Israel) and equal or better to those taken with the Nikon D-90 and the Canon EOS 60-D carried by our friends.  Of course the 5010 is no match for the xz-1, but my camera more than held its own with the big boy DSLR's.The combination of reasonable weight, easy handling, appropriate belt pouch size, outstanding image quality, a superb lcd screen, and most importantly, a wonderful fast lens that allowed me to take indoor and evening pictures without flash, made this the perfect travel camera for my needs.

I wanted a decent zoom range, a view screen good enough to show if the picture focus AND exposure were right following the shot, ability to shoot full manual when needed, macro lens ability and a decently low-lag shutter release. This XZ-1 does all that. Beyond that, there is super macro - so close that the lens is nearly touching the subject and a very good anti shake correction. I've shot model railroads with available light, showing all the subjects in a wide depth-of-field and adding a hint of blur on moving trains, handheld! It's fast enough for grandkids most of the time. Faster zooming would require a manual zoom, not the little power zoom. Turning the camera on pokes the lens cover off, so be sure to secure it with something so you don't lose it. It's important. XZ-1 easily fits into a coat pocket but keep the change and keys away from it as those will mar the view screen.  Learning to use the art filters, finding the procedure for special set-ups like macro, navigating the menus in general is tricky and requires the manual for a week or so. It would be better with a graphical diagram on modes - how to get from here to there - or a situation - 'go to this setting' to proceed. An example would be taking a picture of transmitted light from a stained glass window, exposing both the window and the lit area on stone beyond. The camera will do this well but it will test you to run it in manual for the shot, adjusting both the shutter speed and aperture.  I still haven't determined how to save some custom setting I like. In short, the menu is complex. Do not be afraid of shooting in full auto or program mode but you will mist a lot of capability if that is only what you want - in that case consider a simpler camera.

(slippery fingers) This is one of the most useful cameras I have ever had.  I'm not a pixel peeper, but even at higher ISOs I find the results well within my standards.  I don't believe I have had a picture blown up to 8 x 10 in a long time and for the most part I just download the pictures to my computer an maybe send some to friends and relatives.  I have published several photo books through Blurb and I have been pleased with the results.  I think I represent the average camera user and I am not out to impress anyone with my writing skills by being a critical reviewer.  I think a lot of reviewers want to dazzle you with their knowledge and need to find something wrong with anything just to show their own skills. Anyway, this is just a very nice little camera that I love to use.You can use it in Auto mode and get very nice shots or if you want a little more control use the Program mode.  If the situation warrants it you can control the aperture or shutter speed or even use it in Manual mode. I'm not really into video, but the results are ok for my needs even though the video seems to be something the the reviewers like to blast. The sensor is not as large as my 4/3s Olympus, but I find I am very happy with the quality of the shots.One thing I have noticed is that you seem to have watch the settings in menu.  For some reason a couple of times the ISO got set to 1600 without my input and while taking pictures of the moon in the early evening I noticed that there was a lot of noise.  I checked and found that the ISO had somehow changed from auto to 1600 -- not acceptable.I usually carry my Olympus E-PL1 around my neck and use it with a Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens.  This is an excellent setup for most things, but occasionally I find I want a little telephoto or a wider angle and the xz-1 is an excellent backup.  In bright light it even has a filter to cut down the light and it is also great in low light situations (not dark, but normal interior shots with at least some decent lighting)  I shot pictures at my grand daughters wedding andgot great shots in the church without a flash.I'd say for the average casual photographer, there is no other camera to just stick in your pocket and get such good shots.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "A solid performer !!", "Author": "Jamin Redwood", "ReviewID": "R2UW8SHWIVUTZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, my first digital camera was a Olympus E-20, the big ol DSLR.

I tried no less than 3 cameras for her from Panasonic LX and Canon S series, she didn't,t like menu diving for features like macro or low light scene modes etc.  on a whim I bought the XZ-1 from Amazon warehouse and she loves it.  First the functions are very intuitive, and the scroll wheel that surrounds the lens for selection makes life a dream for simple adjustments like going from inside to outside for her, or when she sees a flower or plant she wants to capture in detail up close as in 1cm away.From my standpoint the image quality is remarkable, I hadn't owned or used a point and shoot in 5 years that I appreciated the images OOC until this one.  The panorama feature in camera is also clever and usable as well.The down and dirty:Pros for me- easy use, fast shutter lag( no hesitation when you pull the trigger), bright lens minimizes flash needed, quick start up time 1-2 seconds, dedicated movie button, very reputable images and accurate color if not a little punchy for a modern look.Cons-Lens cap, over come with a rainbow imaging automatic cap for $9 on Amazon, limited zoom compared to some compacts, battery life while good is still not a full day 350+ images.Bottom line I have bought 2 now for my wife and mother in law, the rainbow imaging lens cap and an extra battery for $20, this is a great little camera and at the current discounts because of the new XZ-2 and 10 models it is a steal of a deal.  And it isn't giving up any performance outside of wi-fi or tilting screens to its brethren.

Sure, it's last year's model but it features the very same 28-112mm f/1.8-2.5 lens as the new $599 Olympus XZ-2.  How bad could it be?Unfortunately, if you plan on shooting JPEGs, it can be pretty bad.  Very aggressive noise reduction is used even at base ISO and chroma noise overwhelms shadowy areas above ISO 400.  The result is smeary, watercolor-looking pictures if you zoom in to 100%.  But I digress; my mom wouldn't notice, and either way it's a far better camera than the dying Canon SD1000 it's replacing.Let a pro or advanced amateur take the wheel and shoot in RAW, however, and you'll be rewarded with extremely sharp, detailed output with manageable levels of noise up to ISO 800.  The lens alone is worth the price of admission, with sharp edge-to-edge performance.  The Image Stabilization works better than the unit on my Fujifilm X10, allowing sharp handheld shots at even 1/4 of a second most of the time.  There is a lot of potential here, it's just a shame Olympus used such a terrible JPEG engine on this camera that masks much of it.Built quality is solid with the front lens ring feeling smooth and precise.  The body has an aluminum front and plastic back.  The OLED display is bright and colorful - perhaps too colorful, sacrificing some accuracy for punchy saturation.All-in-all, this is a good camera for the asking $199 price, primarily if you shoot RAW.

I am a fairly casual but knowledgable hobbyist photographer, taking pictures mostly of urban excursions, my garden and my dogs. In the past I had and loved an all manual film SLR, and for years have made do with a Canon ELPH Powershot 1300SD.In general, I'm very pleased with the first month or so of shooting I've done with it. The key upgrades for me, compared to more standard point and shoots, are aperture and shutter priority shooting modes (as well as full manual), the ability to record RAW photos, and the wide open f1.8 aperture which allows for decent pictures in low light, as well as achieving beautiful soft backgrounds in portraits.Given good lighting conditions, I find that the XZ-1's image quality is not necessarily that much better than my Powershot. However, it's a big improvemnt for portraits and lower light. It has a number of control options that you might only expect in a more serious camera: a hotshoe for a flash unit or viewfinder, better flash options (including ability to drive an external flash wirelessly), sequential shooting options of 2 frames per second up to 15 frames per second, long shutter speeds including 'bulb', the aperture opening to f1.8, selective focus options, and access to primary controls via a ring around the lens.The main complaint I have about the camera is the quality of video -- it's terrible. The autofocus is constantly shifting around making images blurry, there is a lot of shake in general, and the image is not crisp. If video is a priority, get another camera.I would also say that access to some of the controls takes a few too many clicks, such as ISO setting, and the focus options are not great. For manual focus, you are given a grid with eleven hotspots, and you can select one of them. It works well, it's just a little limited and not quick to access. However, those are minor gripes for a camera that costs less than $300 and has so many other great things going for it.

It is a very versatile camera, with manual and automatic settings. Although I've always enjoyed taking pictures manually, I've had as much fun using the auto settings. Reason being that the JPEG rendering from Olympus's processor delivers crisp pictures with good contrast and \"punch\". The filters are also very practical; the filters are not overdone(instagram style)but well balanced and very useful when taking pictures of dull settings or objects. The shallow depth of field is excellent for a point and shoot, and it has macro and super macro settings.The interface is pretty straight-forward and easy to grasp. The ring around the lens which controls different elements under dial modes is brilliant -Olympus should thank Canon for that. There is a hot-shoe and an accessory port for a viewfinder that is sold separately. The camera is somewhat pocketable, but not entirely. I can't carry it in my jeans, but cargo shorts or pants and maybe khaki pants might be large enough to accommodate the xz-1.The pictures in JPEG are excellent, and RAW delivers as well, but high ISO does delivers very noisy pics. ISO at 800 is pretty noisy, and 1600 is probably where the limit is for me in terms of tolerable noise. If I shoot at 800 ISO or higher, I usually shoot in RAW and smooth out the noise in a post processing software.The bad side of the camera lies in the video. If you're looking to purchase a camera with good video, then maybe you should look elsewhere, because the xz-1 is mediocre at best.Overall, I am very happy with this camera.

On high ISO shots, the Olympus noise reduction seems to break down (creating blotches).  Adobe seems to handle it much better.- I replaced the neck-strap with a wrist-strap.  The camera isn't very pocketable with the neck-strap.- The mini-USB port isn't standard.

There is no grip on the front, but there is a small thumb grip on the back.  The camera is easy to hold and all of the buttons and dials are within easy reach.  Build quality is high, with a metal front and tripod, solid feeling buttons and dials, and even the door over the battery compartment feels sturdy.  The lens cap does not lock into place, but I did not have any issues with it falling off.  On the back of the camera is a high resolution OLED screen that is a joy to behold with sharp images and easy viewing, even on a sunny day.  A small pop-up flash hides on the right hand side of the camera.The XZ-1 has lots of great features, like full manual controls, dual control dials (one on the back and one around the lens), a hot shoe, and a built in neutral density filter.  The Olympus also has a built in image stabilizer, and a larger than average sized image sensor for better high ISO image quality (for a point and shoot camera, at least).  The camera's best feature, however, is the lens.  Not only is the maximum aperture a bright f/1.8 on the wide end, but also at telephoto it only closes down to f/2.5.  At 28mm it offers a wide angle view, and is extremely sharp from corner to corner even at maximum aperture and wide angle.  I love this lens!The Olympus turns on quickly, focuses fast (even in low light), and lets you take another picture very quickly, even when shooting RAW and JPEG.  Changing settings and using the menu system is easy and straightforward.  Battery life is good and I can take about 200 shots with some zooming and lots of reviewing of photographs before the battery get low.  The battery charges in camera with the included USB charger.Picture quality of the Olympus is very good, especially at low ISO speeds.  The lens captures great detail and the larger sensor allows for very smooth, noise free images at low ISO speeds.  Color, contrast, exposure, and white balance are all accurate, especially outdoors.  Indoors the automatic white balance setting suffers a bit, but that's not unusual, and the camera offers a custom white balance mode to combat that.  Once the ISO speed hits 400, however, the images start to look a little too mushy for my tastes as the camera tries to combat noise (I am very picky about photo quality though, and I am a \"pixel peeper\").  The camera does not give you any control over noise reduction either.  The upside is that with the f/1.8 lens I hardly ever have to go above ISO 200, even in low light.  Additionally, the wide aperture allows for great shallow depth of field shots, with dramatically blurred backgrounds or foregrounds, especially in Macro mode.  Did I mention I love this lens!  The autofocus is extremely accurate, and it's even easy to manually focus with the Olympus if need be.Video quality is good as well and is recorded in high definition.  You can zoom during a movie, however the audio is recorded in mono.  There is a direct button on the back of the camera to start recording a video.The few things I don't like about the Olympus are that 1) you cannot change the function of the front control dial, 2) you cannot zoom out in playback mode to more than a 20 image grid, 3) sometimes I think a photo is underexposed based on the camera's screen, but when I download it to the computer it's fine, 4) you cannot delete a picture immediately after taking it, 5) it takes two button presses to enter macro mode.All in all...a real joy to use, with photo quality that is a joy to behold.12/11/2011 Update: I just took some night shots and noticed that the screen shows the photos brighter than they are when you download them.

Vogt", "ReviewID": "R1NF7FRWLFPA3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The XZ-1 is about a year and a half old at this point and a replacement is probably on its way later this year. But it still remains the best of the enthusiast compacts. Mainly due to the fact that the pictures that come out of this camera are just so darn good.While not the best choice for high ISO performance (the S100 wins that competition) and the Fuji X10 (when it's working correctly) has a slight edge in image quality, its combination of decent shooting performance and excellent image quality provide the best shooting experience of all the enthusiast compacts on the market today. The lens used on the camera is incredibly sharp at all focal lengths. Exposure is great too. ISO performance up to 400 is impeccable. While the Canon S100 can beat the XZ-1 by about a stop in terms of ISO performance, the pics from the XZ-1 are just better looking overall with better sharpness and detail capture. But the great thing also is that the lens starts at F1.8, so while the ISO performance is not the best in its class, the fast lens means you don't have to pick as high of an ISO in order to shoot in low-light conditions.The camera is not exactly small. You would have a hard time fitting it in your pocket. If pocketability is very important, I would look more at the S95 or S100. It's about the same size as the Lumix LX5. But it's still very solid to hold, and would easily fit in a jacket pocket or cargo pocket. It has a rotating ring on the front for adjusting aperture, but Olympus made a very stupid omission but not being able to customize the ring like on the Canon S95. And plus it feels a little chincy compared to the one on the S95. Another annoying thing is the lens cap. Honestly, I see no excuse (especially since this camera retails for $450-$500) for Olympus not to provide a built in automatic lens cap.Another advantage this camera has is a hot shoe. Which allows you to attach an external flash or the VF-2 accessory viewfinder.The menu system is ok. It works and it's not especially confusing but I have seen better implementations (ie. the Canon). As I say in all my reviews, this camera is jam-packed with features, so a thorough read-through of the manual is highly advisable. I found the LCD fairly servicable with decent viewing capabilities in most conditions.Performance of this camera is generally very good as well. But this is all in relative terms. None of the high-end compacts are any good for action shooting and generally are not very fast overall. But I would say it's faster in Autofocus than the S100 and LX5. Shot-to-shot time aren't too bad either. It also doesn't have the AF issues that the Fuji X10 does.I cannot speak to the movie mode because I never use it on this camera. But from what I hear, it isn't all that great.The enthusiast compact market is full of great cameras at this point. All have photo quality which represents a clear step-up from a regular point and shoot and in some cases rival that of an entry-level DSLR. But the XZ-1, when it comes to stills, still stands out as the best of the bunch.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Truly phenomenal compact", "Author": "dj", "ReviewID": "R1A04YRERGUVZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I figure there are two types of consumers reading reviews for this camera.Type 1: All but decided to buy this camera based on specifications and exhaustive third-party reviews, but want to know if any owners have uncovered critical problems or nuisances.Type 2: Curious to know why people would pay more for a larger-bodied 10 megapixel camera when 16 megapixel cameras can be had for significantly less $.For the Type 1 crowd:I've only taken about 300 shots from this camera, but I can tell you that I'm absolutely thrilled with it. Photos are truly impressive. Controls are far more intuitive than I had imagined. I haven't taken any video, and I probably won't because I have other equipment that handles high-res video much better than this Olympus. Video is not this camera's strong suit, and I'm fine with that.I wanted something that could put out image quality rivaling (nearly) that of my old DSLR (10.1 megapixel Canon Rebel XS + Canon kit lens + f/1.8 Canon prime). In every way, I prefer the XZ-1 to my old Canon DSLR. It's considerably smaller, obviously, and I prefer the images from the XZ-1 pretty much every time. I easily take more \"keepers\" with the XZ-1 than I ever did with the DSLR. White balance seems better controlled, and I prefer the colors from the Olympus. The lens gives me the freedom of taking any type of shot without changing out lenses (no carrying a giant camera bag=bonus for me). And the price versus a DSLR doesn't hurt. FWIW, I snagged my new, black XZ-1 for two bills w/free shipping. Quite a bargain!The only other camera I think I would have really loved is the Sony RX100; price was the instant decider, in this case.For brevity, and because the Type 1 crowd probably consists of mostly enthusiasts, I'll stop there.For the Type 2 crowd:The beauty of this camera (and to great extent others like it) lies mostly in its sensor and lens. The XZ-1 has a 1/1.63\" CCD image sensor. Many (most?) other cameras near this price point offer a 1/2.3\" CMOS sensor. The numbers represent imperial fractions dating back decades to the days of Vidicon tubes. What's important to know is that the XZ-1 sensor is considerably larger than a 1/2.3\" sensor.As best I can determine, the dimensions for the XZ-1's 1/1.63\" sensor are:7.90mm horizontal5.80mm verticalThe dimensions for a 1/2.3\" sensor:6.17mm horizontal4.55mm verticalOk, so what? Well, the XZ-1's sensor has on the order of 60 percent more area than a 1/2.3\" sensor (roughly 60-63 percent larger, depending on which found-on-web dimensions I calculate).What does that mean? It means that if you took a camera equipped with a 10 megapixel 1/1.63\" sensor, and another 10 megapixel camera with a 1/2.3\" sensor, the camera with the larger 1/1.63\" sensor would, ceteris paribus, create a much higher quality photo.So a larger sensor is better...but why? Image sensors, in a nutshell, convert light into electric charges that are processed into electrical signals that later transform into what we view as photographs. In my 10 megapixel comparison, the larger sensor has larger pixels, and larger pixels benefit from additional volume for capturing more photon (light) capacity, which lets them produce higher dynamic range and less perceived image noise. So if we consider a little 1/2.3\" sensor with an even higher resolution, let's say 16 megapixels, the already small pixels are made even smaller to accommodate the additional almost 6 million pixels on the tiny sensor. So small just became smaller. There's a point of diminishing return when you add pixels but don't add pixel size (sensor size). When you take a 1/2.3\" sensor and cram in 12, 14, or 16 million pixels, you may create some perceived sharpness, but you'll almost certainly reduce overall image quality by increasing perceived noise and lowering dynamic range.The wide aperture of the sweet Zuiko lens (from f/1.8 at its widest, to f/2.5 at full zoom), coupled with the relatively large image sensor, allows you to take photos with a shallow depth of field for more artistic control. A shallow depth of field means shots with background blur, or bokeh; this is highly desirable for most photographers. Full manual controls and a front control ring make this kind of photography easy with the XZ-1. Aperture priority mode is a real treat.Most compact point-and-shoot cameras offer extremely limited manual controls, usually just ISO and/or exposure.Some image processing takes place inside all cameras before they output to a lossy JPEG. This is just fine for most casual shooters, but enthusiasts often want greater control over post-processing (tweaking photos in Lightroom, Photoshop, or the likes). The XZ-1 can shoot in Raw (large, \"unprocessed\" image data files) and/or JPEG, and camera buffs dig this flexibility in post-processing.That concludes my in-a-nutshell summary, folks. I hope this has been informative. There are plenty of excellent resources on the web that cover the science in far greater detail. As well, there are many excellent books, even textbooks, that will help you to better understand some of the things I've mentioned.

But I was spoiled by the Contax incredible Sonnar f1.5 lens' available light capability.  The XZ-1 has filled its shoes admirably, letting me take low light photos without flash that amaze my friends due to its incredibly fast lens. For me, even more important than its f1.8 aperture when wide open is its f2.5 aperture at full telephoto which really sets it apart from its competition. The faster shutter speeds this permits help minimize hand-held telephoto camera shake.To take full advantage of its capabilities, you actually have to read the manual and practice with different settings. Point & shoot will only take you so far. BTW, it's a good thing it shoots so well with available light since its flash is weak and best used in its \"Fill-In\" mode where it augments the XZ-1's low light shooting rather than replacing it. I love the detail, contrast & resolution of its OLED screen; I even find myself using the Art Scene on occasion to good effect.Downsides?The silly lens cap which I replaced with a Rainbow Image Self Retaining Auto lens cap. (Works great, but does add some depth making it a little less pocket friendly).The beautiful OLED screen is exposed to scratches when you pocket the camera.

I can dream, can't I?)Otherwise I find the XZ-1 a fun tool that allows me to be creative in my picture taking.

I have/had a Nikon D3000, D5000 and a D300 and feel this takes far better photos than any of those. Obviously there is more you can do with a full DSLR. But just a quick auto boot and shoot. This camera is faster and better quality even in low lights. Trust me I spent weeks looking/comparing model, manufacture even looked at Leica and of the ones I could afford this was the best point-and-shoot betting out the quality of all my other cameras.My only complaint is no auto flash - you have to decide to use it. The face detection is terrible. It might focus no someone's elbow and not their face.Something to note: 20MP camera doesn't mean better quality - there is a point you're taking in more quality in than the human eye can see. And if you don't want to print 50x60 close up photos. Than remember not all sensors are created equal. 10MP can be better than a cheap 20MP camera.

I've never had a digital camera that had cost me more $80. I decided it was time for a change to have a camera that at least could take pictures inside! I read lots of reviews and recommendations. It had to be a cheaper option. Anything over $300 was out of the question. I know very little about the specific of photography. I don't understand what all the numbers mean, still not sure what everything on my camera does, but I'm learning.Due to some really good reviews, I decided to get the Olympus XZ-1, which I snagged at slightly used at $225 to save some money. I waited a couple months of full use before reviewing. I took it on vacation with me, everything.And this camera never ceases to amaze me! I'm still learning everyday.What I love:Its simple to operate, even for someone as inexperienced as me.I love to make use of the Art and Scene modes, but the iAuto never fails to take a decent picture.I can take pictures indoors without the pesky flash (which although an ugly, manual pop-up flash, I rarely use).The display is beautiful. My pictures look better on it than they do on my computer.The selection dial on the lens is handy.Picture quality.Pet mode is especially handy to catch your jittery animal friends.What I don't love, but gladly deal with:A little bulkier and heavier than I'm used to.Popping the lens cap on and off.Ugly flash pop-up.My main issue is the only 4x zoom. I feel like trying to take a shot of anything at a distance is pointless. At least a digital zoom would have maybe been nice.A lot of people say the video is low quality. I hardly ever take videos, so this doesn't really apply to me. However, from what I've tried, it seems average anyway.I love this camera more and more every time I use it.

When I first recieved it, it felt light and cheap and I was a little annoyed about the lens cap being removeable (I don't do well with those).  After turning it on, my opinion changed immediately.  The lens is extremely bright and fast and the OLED screen makes the photos pop.  I had been eyeing this camera since it's release a year and a half ago and have hesitated because of the price but at $200, I could not pass it up.  After a few outings, I decided to leave my bigger E-Pl3 at home during my vacation to Italy.  I was worried that I had made a bad decision considering that I would be taking so many pictures but I must say, I was not disappointed with the results.This camera is a perfect travel companion (though it's zoom could be better).  I was able to get every kind of shot I would with my E-Pl3 without the hassle of changing lenses or even carrying numerous lenses.  Even better, during the whole trip, I did not lose the lens cap.  One of the reasons I have stuck with Olympus is that I find that their image processing is to my liking moreso than those of Panasonic or Canon.  The processor is so good that if you know somewhat what you're doing, you will come out with excellent JPEGs that do not require any processing at all.  As much as I once loved the post processing aspect, I'm finding that I have less time to do it and by the time I've processed a shoot, it has been a month since the event.  This makes it that much better for me at least.The hotshoe proved very useful with my speedlight (the metering is off a bit but you can always compensate through the flash) and it's beginning to bother me that I'm starting to wonder why I keep the E-PL3 around.

I don't know what it is exactly (the edge-to edge crispness of the lens, even at wide apertures, certainly doesn't hurt) but images seem to capture a lot of the ambience of the original scene. It doesn't seem to matter too much that the sensor isn't big enough to make noise a total non-issue (I plan to pretty much leave it set to ISO 100 anyway, as you can hand-hold even night shots at f/1.8 thanks to the I.S.). Have a look at the XZ-1 group on flickr and you will see what I mean; this camera really does take beautiful pictures.

This camera really excels at lower light levels where my last camera would have been all but useless.The controls on this camera are not quite as intuitive as I would like.  My biggest gripe is the lack of ability to add fill flash in the intelligent auto mode.  Yes, it is there in the program mode but really? no fill flash in what should be the smartest settings on the camera?There is a panoramic mode where you can (theoretically) take several separate photos and let the camera stitch them together into one panorama.

I could do a better job with scissors and tape.All in all I am happy with the XZ-1.

Initial impressions were really good, but then we started running into metering/scene issues when in iAuto mode. Although I can use Program and set it up properly for what Im shooting, this is impossible for my wife to do since you dont have time when taking pictures of a 16 month old on the go.Comparing this camera to my old LX3, the Panasonic rarely gives my wife trouble when in full Auto mode. The metering is usually spot on, picks the right scene majority of the time and the face tracking seems to be much better.The XZ1 delivers some really impressive jpeg pictures even in close ups unlike the LX3 which could get noisy and I have to run it through a filter. I rarely have the time to touch up photos so this is a big plus for me. One thing that I cannot deal with, is the video quality, or lack thereof. I knew it only did 720p with mpeg compression, but the LX3 is really similar and I found the video coming out of the Panasonic acceptable for our needs. Little did I know that the XZ1 spends more time hunting for focus than shooting a video.I dont need 1080p with Stereo sound, but I expected the XZ1 to shoot better video than my cell phone and this camera really falls short in that regard. Spent a whole day on the web looking for a solution and although it got better, it still liked to focus in and out even when not moving around.We dont want to drag 2 cameras around and just need one that works, hence the XZ1 is going back.

It is a great camera with lots of features, excellent specifications etc. There are, however, a couple of things I would like to see different about this camera:Suggestions for further improvement:1. The lens cap is entirely inadequate. I bought the \"RainbowImaging Self-Retaining Auto Lens Cap for Olympus XZ-1 XZ1 DC\" RainbowImaging Self-Retaining Auto Lens Cap for Olympus XZ-1 XZ1 DC. This ended up making the camera bigger, too big to fit in the camera case that I bought for it, which is: \"Case Logic QPB-202 EVA Molded Flash Camcorder or Medium Zoom Camera Case (Black)\" Case Logic QPB-202 EVA Molded Flash Camcorder or Medium Zoom Camera Case (Black). Olympus really should have been more mindful of this; there is no excuse for not doing so.2. The video format that it records in is .avi. Why can't it record to .mov format instead or also? Moreover, I can not transfer video files to my MacBook Pro using iPhoto (pictures transfer just fine). Only one frame of the video file is transferred. I never had this problem with my canon 1100IS compact digital camera. I allowed iPhoto to delete the files from the camera, thinking that the transfer went OK (it did NOT indicate otherwise!). To transfer video files, drag and drop using Finder instead.3. It seems that renaming the memory card in the finder causes a \"Card Error.\" You might want to avoid doing this.4. The dial to control the shooting mode (Auto, Aperature, etc) is too easy to access, and many times I change the setting accidentally when taking pictures in a chaotic environment.5. They include a neck strap, which is nice, but a wrist strap would have been better. Wrist straps are pretty cheap, so it wouldn't have cost much more to include it.6. Memory also is pretty cheap these days, so they should have included more internal memory too. But most cameras have small internal memory, so I can't really judge Olympus too hard for this.This is not a camera that you can operate easily with one hand and use quickly at parties, etc. It is a serious camera.

The only downside to this camera is that it leans toward the heavy side. It probably won't fit in your pocket. If you need that, go with the XZ 10. But if you are willing to take a bit more weight in a camera, go with this one.

Imagine my surprise when I saw this camera for less than $200!The camera is feature rich to say the least. Almost too much. Expect a fairly steep learning curve even with reading the manual. I'm slowly getting there and the more I use the camera the more I'm impressed with the features.So far the low light has been fairly impressive. It used to be that I would have to turn on every light downstairs to get a decent picture. But no more, provided I've selected the correct white balance low light pictures are quite nice. Far better than my previous attempts. The camera also excels at macro shots. There are two macro settings for close and insanely close shots. The panorama function is kind of neat. Take a picture and swing left or right  and a target appears. Line up the target and it captures the next shot automatically. You can capture three shots to make a panorama.

I were looking for a camera a) smaller and lighter than GF1, b) better image quality than TS3 and iPhone4 c) zoom lens. There are several candidates in the market like LX5, S100/S110 etc. The reasons I picked up xz-1 were because of its bright lens and the price (I got it at $200!).I carried this camera with me every day, and compared it with other cameras I have.Pros:- Good image quality in this level. Slight better than G11.- Fun to use: multiple-exposure, panorama are useful.- Small and light-weight enough.- Anti-shake works. I combined this with continuous shoot, and could get one sharp image from a group of photos in 1/15s with the longest zoom.There are enough reviews in web sites such as dpreview.com, so I'll focus on the cons.Cons:- Image quality is worse than GF1 (because of smaller size). This is as expected.- The slowest shutter speed is very limited in aperture priority mode, most are 1/15s. Very change. I used the manual mode to set a slower shutter speed. This design is very strange. I did NOT encounter this issue on my other cameras.- The mode dial is easy to change without your notice. Whenever picking up it from my bag, I have to check whether its still in aperture mode.- The custom mode is very limited. It does not remember the focal length, aperture and so on. This is not like G11 and GF1. This makes the custom mode not much useful.- The time lag from power on to shoot the first photo is significant. Not a quick camera.- The macro mode is not really macro. The super macro mode is the truly macro, but limited in two ways: fixed focal length; very closed distance for macro shooting (easy to put the shadow of your camera on the subject, and not easy for insects etc.)This camera is VERY good for people who already have DSLR and want to find a small buddy to carry everyday. It's NOT good for serious portrait shooting (more noise and deeper DOF than GF1 and DSRL) and sports shooting (a little slow in startup and continuous shoot).I'm very satisfied with this camera.

I traded in the first one I got for a larger sensor camera to take as a backup on a trip, but I've missed having a pocketable take-anywhere shooter.The title of my review gives my fundamental thoughts about the camera. I shoot raw and don't mind using Adobe Lightroom to develop files to my liking, but if I only shot jpeg I would not be happy with the XZ-1, which applies aggressive noise reduction and sharpening at all iso speeds, getting more aggressive as they go higher. Having said that, I should acknowledge that I'm generally unhappy with jpegs from small sensor cameras. The Leica D-lux 4 was about the only exception I can think of, and jpegs from the pansonic version of the same camera left me cold.If you shoot raw, though, this camera produces great files with lots of information to work. The lens is superb -- sharp, fast, and resolving lots of detail; the image stabilization is very good; and the controls are easy to access and use. I love having the control ring around the lens, as that is where the shutter speed ring was on the old Olympus OM film cameras. I find the files up to iso 800 usable with no problem if they are properly exposed. You're not going to print them at the 100% on screen size, so don't expect them to have printable quality at that magnification. 8x10 or 11x14 at 800 iso is perfectly reasonable -- 16x20 at iso 100 should be no problem --- IF you shoot raw files. With a zoom that is still quite fast at its telephoto limit, there will be very few occasions where you will need to shoot higher than iso 800.For the best results, software other than Olympus's own Studio or Viewer 2 should be used, something that allows some control of color noise seperate from luminance. The Olympus raw development software is rather crude.

I have used this camera for about two weeks now and have taken over hundreds of pictures with it, from random scenery shots, macro shots to family gatherings.  And XZ-1 has not disappointed me when it comes to picture quality!  It rivals some of the entry/mid level DSLR... and with practice and adjusting the setting, the picture is clean, sharp and its low light performance is just simply amazing, especially without flash.  The ambient light from the buildings and light poles is sufficient for taking some natural looking, clean and shape images.  Of course, you will need to play with a setting a bit, and once in a while, take a multiple shots.  But the pictures are stunning clear with very little noise.  I am not a trained photographer, but I have quite a bit of experience working with computer graphics and I enjoy artistic work.  And XZ-1 is more than just satisfying... like other reviewers, it's a lot of fun to use!  However, I do have to caution that XZ-1 is no magic camera and it probably won't take a perfect picture every single time (and I believe no camera can)... yet with a bit of practice, its true potential for creating amazing pictures can be realized.  I am glad that I buy this camera and looking forward to preserving some memories and beautiful pictures for years to come!  One last note, if video recording will be a big part of your routine, you might want to look elsewhere, as the video recording ability of XZ-1 is minimal (mostly due to its inability to have a good focus)!  You better off record it on your smartphone or other devices.

Since the technology of camera improves quickly, I would like to have a compact camera with good video recording feature.3. I read reviews from [...] and found XZ-1 is marked as Golden Award. Comparing with other Gloden Award cameras, XZ-1 has relatively low price.4. I don't have any professional knowledge of photography and don't have experience using any type of SLR camera, so I ignored some negative reviews published by DSLR users complaining the image quality by comparing with DSLR camera.Based on above background,  I bought this camera 2 two months ago. After using it several times, I am satisfied very much for the features of this camera. In almost all aspects, this camera is much more better than my old canon IXUS 40.But in video recording area. it is below my expectation. it totally cannot compete with my old Canon hard disk camcorder in multiple ares: definition is bad. video looks blur. speed of focusing is low so that when you move the lens towards items in different distance, this camera will spend 3-5 seconds to focus, which ends up with the recorded video is always very blur.One another minor issue is that only photo/video preview feature is available once plugging in USB cable for charging. I have a external USB battery for my cell phone,  so I thought this camera could also take benefit once out of battery during photographing . But currently once I plug in the USB cable, all other features will be shut down until I remove the cable.

After researching a number of cameras extensively I went with the XZ-1 - I needed a fast lens for low light shooting and also wanted the bokeh capability that this lens offers.  The availability of full manual control of virtually every aspect of shooting was a big plus as well.  The XZ-1 has exceeded my expectations - photo quality is superb and the flexibility of having total control of all functions is wonderful.  I am finding that the controls and menu interface are very intuitive and quickly learned, and access to the controls and settings I use most frequently is fast and simple.  The shallow depth of field bokeh effect is amazing for such a small camera and is a reflection of the superb quality of this lens.I bought an aftermarket automatic lens cap and it's OK but adds quite a bit of bulk to the lens and makes the camera a poor fit in a slimmer case.  I've found that I don't mind the Olympus lens cap with its lanyard, it pops off when the camera is turned on and hasn't turned out to be the annoyance I expected - and is a small price to pay for having this wonderful lens.  I prefer a small wrist strap to the neck strap that came with the camera - the wrist strap fits more easily in the small belt pouch I use to carry the camera and makes it much quicker to grab it and shoot.There's no one best camera - but certainly the wide spectrum of choices make it possible to find the perfect camera for whatever you need.

I had the camera for three days and returned it to Ritz camera for the following reasons: 1) onboard flash severely under powered requiring large boost in ISO or exposure compensation: 2)not a well thoughtout lens cap design, cap pops off if not removed when turning the camera on-extremely aggreviating; 3)strange reddish hue noticed in most exposures which may not be eliminated even with white balance fine tuning; and 4)Auto Jpeg images usually soft and not well defined. The XZ-1 performance in auto was compared to the Nikon P7000 and S8100 and each of the Nikon's image quality was dramatically better than the Olympus(cameras were set with comparable resolutions).I really expected much better results from this $500.00 point and shoot and could not phantom the idea of spending another $200.00 for a Olympus flash to take up the slack of the anemic on-board flash.

Amazon placed an amazing sale price on this item, and honestly, for the reduced price, it can not be beat. So I went and grabbed one. Sure there are the Lumix's DMC LX5 with 20x optical lenses, and then there are the Canon s95 and the Nikon p7000; but they will not be reduced in price anytime soon. This camera comes in black and white. The white still sells for over $300. Still not bad, but when going to that price, the Canon's and Nikon are a better bargain. Now at $200, the Olympus XZ-1 can't be beat. It has a RAW picture setting which, in my opinion, is very good. Now, take to heart, this is not a point and shoot. This is more of an amateur photographer's camera. Not a quick point and shoot. The camera does has a quick 1.8 lens. The shudder speed and snap taking is maybe the quickest I have seen on most cameras. The menus are fairly simple, but take some time to learn. I was very used to Canon's button mapping, and it seems many newer Nikon's are following Canon's lead. Olympus is a bit of a departure. You will need some time to learn the features, where they are at, and how you use the camera. That being said, its not a hindrance. What Olympus did do, is take the ring feature from Canon. On the lens, there is an adjusting ring, and depending on which mode you are in, this ring sets aperture or your ISO settings. Its really great when you have the time to play with the settings. I also like the scroll wheel on the back; just wish it was bigger. The camera is larger than most in this category, but also compact enough for a jacket pocket. There is a large 3\" OLED screen on the back, but no optical viewfinder. You can attach a mini optical view finder to this camera with the port on the back (sold separately). There is also a hot-shoe socket. The pop-up flash has been more than adequate. In most cases with fixed lens cameras, daytime shooting is great, and night time shooting takes time and practice. It also includes Olympus's Viewer software to view RAW images and edit them, and then save them to use with your other photo programs. For $200, its a great step to going towards an SLR, without breaking the bank, and want some better looking vacation photos to print 8\" by 10\".

The XZ1 has gone back up to $349 as I am looking today...Can't see it.At this level. seriously consider the Panasonic LX5, or a Samsung NX100 or NEX-C3 if you have large coat pockets.Yes the LX5 and the others are slightly more, but if you are tempted by the $349 XZ1, you must be serious enough about photos to spend more than a P&S; budget. (And with the NEX, you will get better high-Iso and much better video as kickers...)I tried two different XZ1's, because I thought perhaps I got a poor first one, since so many reviewers rated the XZ1 quite high.As mentioned by others, the video is quite poor , mostly due to slow focusing. But that's all I will say about video for now, since some Amazon reviewers claim not to be really interested in video on a camera anyway.  That puzzles me, because I don't carry a separate videocam - it defeats the purpose of preferring a \"small\" camera in the first place if you are carrying a separate video unit, no ?Before I start on Pros and Cons, let me refer you to a site called DxOMark.com which tests and rates the pure performance of a camera sensor alone, ignoring lens and firmware. The XZ1 scores 34, whereas most of the direct competion is higher (e.g. LX5 is 41). This may be a major crippling factor that explain the first of my Cons you will read in this review.PROS : - XZ1 has pretty good color balance outdoors and even indoors. though indoors does have a slight red hue a lot of times, but not disagreeable. And the color balance does have a lot of adjustment ability, my favorite being the ability to directly snap a pic of something white where you are, and the XZ1 will use that as Auto WB until the camera is turnd off or reset. It does this quite accurately, whereas some cams I've tried do not custom set WB well.  - has a really nice interface/menu system once you learn it. Not very complex to be able to do a LOT of things. And this camera does have a LOT of ability to control situations - more than the rather short menu appears to have at first. Fun to find new ability every time you pick up the camera for the first month or so.  - some of the things not found on all the competitors (esp at $199 !!) are Flash exposure adjustment, Color Balance even in Auto mode, Live View, many in-between ISO ratings (e.g. 160,320,640, 2000 etc) and more.  - all in all, I really liked the operation and feel.  - The camera can take clear stills at 400 and 800, so why have the Auto mode prefer iso 200 so many times in low-light indoo situations ??  - build quality appears very high, even tho I was a little taken aback by the heavy opening and closing thud of the camera entending its lens.CONS:  - both cams I tried seemed to \"lock onto\" iso 200 and 1.8 aperture to shoot almost all indoor pics, which often then were at 1/13 or 1/15 shutter speed. Why have a fast lens, if all you can do is 1/13 shutter speed...????  - P mode lets you put iso above 200 okay, but you lose some speed again if the XZ1 selects 4.0 or 4.5 aperture, so you are left with shooting Aperture or Manual modes to be able to control ISO and Aperture at the same time. Now for me Aperture mode is near normal, but for those who think the XZ1 is a \"superfast low-light Auto-mode sensation\", they are going to be surprised.And, sorry, but the Lummix LX5 and even the Lumix ZS15 (a real deal !) have much better video.

This camera is a compliment to your existing DSLR out there, but is no substitute to any DSLR (DX or FX):...a DSLR DX format sensor is more than 8 times larger in area than this sensor in the XZ-1. However, this sensor is high quality for the size it is. It is actually easier to manufacture a higher quality sensor in this size with FEWER mega pixels than it is the same size sensor with more mega pixels. So the believe that higher pixel number (over the same sensor area) results in a better sensor is incorrect. A lower pixel density will make for a more solid and robust sensor and is less prone to failure. With a good design one can make a much more stable and responsive sensor. This XZ-1 sensor is of great quality. And in my opinion is actually of better quality than the XZ-2 sensor. The reason why is that the XZ-2 sensor is physically slightly smaller and the pixel density is higher. That makes it (very likely) less robust. That is a simplified statement not taking smaller design rules into consideration (the base design rule of making a semiconductor chip). We will see more interesting changes in the future as process technologies will approach the single digit scale in the nanometer range.Camera manufacturers love this compact camera market. They use smaller sensors and charge as much money as for a DX sensor based DSLR camera.  Manufacturing a DX format sensor, not to mention a FX sensor, is exponentially more difficult and higher in cost due to particle contamination challenges in semiconductor processing and in the resulting lower yield for these sensors during manufacturing as a result of particles and other defects during manufacturing.So, as an enduser, one is much smarter to buy a full DX type DSLR camera than a $600 to $1300 compact camera (especially with interchangeable lenses). You get more camera when buying a DSLR DX format camera than buying a fashionable compact camera. The lenses for these compact cameras can be of much less quality (the lenses for these cameras have to cover a much smaller sensor area, so the optics necessary is much lower in production cost) and the enduser pays many times more than they do for DX and FX lenses. It's a huge profit margin for camera manufacturers.That's why it doesn't make economic sense (and from the picture quality) to buy a compact type camera with interchangeable lenses.  Not to mention that a compact camera with interchangeable lenses is not compact at all and much more unhandy to handle.Therefore, the XZ-1 is a great compact camera: It's got high quality lens fully attached with it, and the sensor is small but of great quality (but larger than the low end consumer cameras). And if you can get it under $300, you got a deal.If you are not satisfied at any edge of the XZ-1 performance, buy a full fledged DX DSLR camera (huge jump in what's possible based on the sensor)  instead of looking at a Leica compact, Sony Rx-100, or whatever camera. Buy a real DSLR with a DX type sensor or better (FX).  Because all of the compacts have their limits in their sensors.If you are buying an XZ-1 compact, then you made a great choice for buying a compact!  It's the best one you can buy unless you need video.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "One heck of a camera, picture quality that rivals a DSLR  in a small package.", "Author": "Bob Stolz", "ReviewID": "R1DC97C9MQJFAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the reviews on this camera I decided to give it a go.

I have had a Canon S95 as my RAW shooting compact for a while, and the F2 lens was nice, but only at 28mm.  It quickly dropped to F5.9 by 105mm, which made it pretty unusable at the tele end unless you were in bright sunlight.  Plus the low light performance started falling apart at ISO800.I was really intrigued by the fast lens, F2.5 @112mm and of course the big F1.8 at 28mm.  In good light this little camera is amazing.  The lens is razor sharp, and its colors are fantastic.  However, since I use it mostly as a point and shoot, I leave it in AutoISO almost all the time.  I started to realize why the Auto ISO would only go up to ISO200 even when the shutter speed dropped to questionable levels (i.e., 1/13-1/8s)  Turns out its low light, high ISO performance is not very good despite that fact that is has a larger 1/1.63\" sensor than the S95 (1/1.7\").  Overall, the AF is fast (much faster than the S95 and G12), the body handles well with the front control ring and rear dial.  The rear OLED screen is so crisp and clear, but is pretty dim outdoors...the same problem that all OLED screens have.But there are big ergonomic issues that keep it from being a 5 star rating.  The biggest one is that the exposure compensation requires a press of the 4-way D-pad then moving the rear dial.  Not as convenient as just turning the rear like like the S95.  The lens cap is utterly useless and its bound to get lost within the first use.  Luckily, there is a solution, the LC-63A auto cap, which you have to pay an extra $20-$25 more for.  The biggest complaint is that you can only charge the battery while in the camera through the proprietary USB port.  It does come with a AC wall wart USB charger, but it outputs the same 500ma as any USB port on your computer.  Since the battery is only 925mAh, you'll need a spare if you take a lot of photos on vacation. I ended up buying a spare battery and an external charger so I could always have a spare charging/charged without having to swap in and out of the camera.Overall its a bit chunkier than the S95, but has a much more usable lens for low light.  There are some drawbacks, but it has a hotshoe (and works well for taming bright sunlight as it syncs flash at any shutterspeed, up to your slowest flash duration). Its a great camera in moderate light levels, but you'll need something with the new M4/3 16mp sensor if you want a compact camera with good ISO performance up to 3200.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Fei He", "ReviewID": "R12XTLSAP2ITKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my parents.

I mostly use cameras to take pictures of my kids and family (playing, events, visiting family etc), along with a few pictures of merchandise. It is rare for me to use a camera for things like nature photography, portraits, on a tripod, etc. I had a Nikon film SLR which was great, but film is hard to use now, and I wanted my photos in a digital form to share with my family, without spending all day scanning them (never bought a negative scanner). I chose the XZ-1 because I was looking for a small camera that approached an SLR in features and quality.I got this camera because I wanted something I could fit in the pocket of my blue jeans. The idea was that I could take it wherever I went, similar to a cell phone, but with much better quality. It turns out this camera will fit in a front pocket, albeit a little snugly. However, I quickly realized that I needed to attach the camera strap after the camera slipped and I dropped it (fortunately I made a miraculous mid-drop catch). There is just not a good enough grip on this camera. With the strap, it was no longer pocketable, and I had to get a fanny pack for it. It's still a small-end fanny pack, but it means I just don't end up taking this with me everywhere, which is disappointing. If I knew I was going to end up carrying it in a pack, I would have gone larger.One of the things my cell phone camera fails badly at is low light (indoors photography). This camera is definitely a step up, but compromises have to be made, at least if you don't want to (or can't) use the flash (I don't). At first I used the higher ISO levels, but those make the images grainy and that looks bad to me (ISO 200 might be okay, but anything above that is useless). I stick to ISO 100 now. When I am indoors I check the shutter speed on \"P\" mode. If it is below 1/15\" I switch to shutter priority mode, and force 1/15\" or 1/20\" (ISO 100). For typical shots of people this is enough to minimize the blur. I suspect part of the reason this speed works is because any slower and the anti-shake is less effective. My hands aren't shaking like caffeine, but I'm no pro either. Not being able to steady the camera against my face makes things harder to keep still. If people move at this speed, they can still blur.Of course, setting the speed like that will make the images come out dark, so using white balance on Google+ or GIMP is needed to brighten up the image. Since I use ISO 100, post-processing seems to work. One other thing I discovered for low light shooting is not to zoom in if I can help it. When the camera is zoomed, the camera doesn't allow f/1.8 (zooming one step drops it to f/1.9, and it's f/2.5 fully zoomed) it'll drop to 2.0, 2.2 or even 2.4), so that means less light is being gathered. What I do instead is try to get closer and then crop the image (basically a form of digital zoom).At first, I was shooting RAW + JPG, but I found that unless I wanted to spent all day tweaking pics, the JPG output was pretty much always good enough, and in many cases, I couldn't even match it, so I switched to JPG exclusively (L-F mode).When trying to take a bunch of pics quickly, the automatic image review becomes annoying long. However, I found a trick: if the shutter button is pressed halfway (for focus) it seems to come out of review mode immediately.The lens cap is clumsy, I'm thinking about getting the automatic cap. Oftentimes I need to take a shot in a hurry and I forget to remove it. Fortunately, the camera seems to be able to push off the cap without a problem. I have no idea if doing that is bad for the camera. Sometimes the lens cap comes off when I didn't intend it to, but not too often.It is extremely easy to switch shooting modes without realizing it; I wish the dial had more friction to it. When the camera is first turned on (or modes changed, etc) it tells the shooting mode on the screen, but after 10 seconds, that all turns off, and there is no indication anymore, so I changed the setting so it displays the info all the time.Another thing my cell phone camera couldn't handle was macro photography (there was a macro setting, but it just didn't work). This camera has two macro modes. In order to focus closer than a few feet or so, macro mode is required. Then, there is a super macro for shooting within inches (no zoom in that mode). Super macro is the mode I end up using most of the time, but I haven't figured out how to get a good depth of field yet, so part of the object will look great and the rest blurry. I've had to discipline myself to always remove macro mode immediately when I am done with it, because it's a pain to change the setting and might cause me to miss a shot while fooling around with it.When I had a film SLR, the lens could be grabbed and turned to zoom, and another ring for focusing. This camera uses a ring around the shutter button. There is also a ring around the lens, but it is not used for zoom (used for setting shutter speed or ISO (just weird), depending on the mode). In my opinion, the two should have been swapped. Maybe they did it that way for one handed shooting? But this camera doesn't have a good enough grip for that. Or maybe it's just the norm these days and I'm out of date.Some of the button presses required to access common features I felt were a bit cumbersome. For example, to change the autofocus mode, 3 different buttons have to be pushed. Yet, exposure setting, which I never use, is a single button (it changes my exposure length, which I don't like). Setting the timer requires three presses, plus the shutter. A button is dedicated to video recording, but that probably would have made more sense on the dial. Other buttons could have been more useful there, for example more settings for manual mode, or manual focus. I suppose they were trying to de-clutter, but the choices seem geared toward someone who likes to tweak settings. But IMO, if a person has enough time to set all that stuff, they can push a few more buttons to do it. I'd rather have quickest access to the essential stuff.I wish the autofocus sound could be disabled. I stuck a piece of black tape over the holes on the bottom of the camera, but it only helps slightly.The full manual is only available as a PDF, which is disappointing, but that's the norm these days.Video recording works well (much better than my cellphone could pull off, especially due to zoom), but it's limited to around 3 minutes in 720p (due to the 2GB FAT32 limit), so don't expect to use it like a camcorder. It is unfortunate that they did not allow it span files, then they could be spliced together on the computer. The video codec is substandard, so that's why 3 minutes takes up 2 GB. This length limit basically ruins the video feature for me, but I still use it for short clips, like when my kids are playing.This isn't really related to the camera itself, but one area where my cellphone won, was that it would auto-upload my photos to Google+. That was extremely convenient, because often I just plugged it in overnight and had it upload.. then when I had time I could batch them to share. I wrote myself a Linux shell script that handles copying the photos to my hard drive, uploading now (by way of an Android virtual machine), and then deleting from the camera. It's not as convenient, but still that problem is mostly solved.I feel like I've done a lot of criticizing, but overall this camera is definitely better than my cellphone, at least when I have it with me, I just think *I* made a bad buying decision. So that's why I rate this 4 stars instead of 3. Obviously it's best in daylight, but my cellphone was fine then too. It's a win indoors, where I can actually take photos that aren't just a big blur. The anti-shake helps me. And, it's nice to be able to have a bit of optical zoom when outdoors, when I can't get closer. Still, I can't help but wonder if I wouldn't have been better off with a full DSLR with larger lenses, where I could do better in low light, have a more familiar interface for zooming, and have a viewfinder (well, one that isn't an expensive add-on).", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy something else if you are okay with being a classless chump.", "Author": "F.

I was looking for a small, easy portable camera that would give me the option to take snap shots but also grow as a photographer. I was tempted by the apparently great lens and larger sensor of the XZ-1 compared to regular point-and-shoot cameras. The price went way down lately and I wanted to give this camera a try.The camera seems nicely built and is professional looking. I compared the pics of this camera to 2 point and shoot cameras, the Canon SX260 and the Panasonic XZ20. Most pics were done outside. I was not impressed by the Olympus. The colors (using auto mode) seemed over-saturated and unnatural compared to the other 2 cameras. Surprisingly the \"better\" lens and larger sensor did not provide more detail when cropping pictures and zooming in on an object of interest.The video capability is way more limited then with the other two cameras.More professional photographers might be able to get around the color saturation issue. The better lens might still be helpful in low light situations.

Boy was I disappointed!Pros: great battery lifeFast startup and write time to cardSuper Amoled viewer is top notch and real time focusing.Great flash unitNice construction with aluminum and good quality materials.Cons: onboard photo processing too aggressive, with JPEG pixels merged and overprocessed leaving image too soft and loosing crisp details.Controls on back are too small and flat... requires two or more menus to change settings like macros and self timer. Lens barrel control is redundant and confusing.Video function is worthless, videos are jerky and overprocessed leaving whole frames blurred as focus changes.Macro shots have pin point focus and huge depth of field on barreled out of focus with narrow objects like a flower or small animal.1.8 is worthless with this lens! All that great glass and the camera cannot handle its own capabilities.Camera does not come with a memory card! You would think for $425.00 they could sell it ready to use out of the box.Overall this little super pocket shooter does not live up to the reputation of Olympus's history of great lenses and conservative picture processing. You literally have to leave this in full auto mode to take mediocre shots. Any combination of manual modes or program mode finds you taking multiple shots tweaking the settings to get a focused shot as you intended.The worst thing is the onboard processing smudging up the details of every picture!Wish I could sell this for $400 and get the Nikon or Fuji.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent portable shooter with serious and basic flaw", "Author": "Sanjiv Gupta", "ReviewID": "R3APVHJRQ13F0J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera performs well for target use, namely as a portable yet powerful, adjustable tool for taking pictures that can rival SLRs'. The handling quirks mentioned in some reviews become much less of an issue with practice, even the lack of a dedicated ISO button. However there's a rather serious problem affecting its real world usefulness as an easy to carry camera: You can't install the customary UV filter (or any other) to protect this lens, which is after all the main reason to get this camera and likely the component most expensive to repair or replace. When contacted, Olympus says the \"the lens is proprietary and does not accept standard filters.\" But this is hardly an explanation--why be \"proprietary\" about allowing the user to protect your own product, and if you must be, why not offer a filter yourself? This problem is all the more serious because the camera also lacks the customary built in flaps that cover the lens when you turn it off. This lack of protection seriously compromises the camera precisely in its intended function as an easy to carry and therefore frequently used tool; the more often you use it, the more likely you are to unwittingly damage that lovely lens and rue your investment.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of class, video recording time could be better", "Author": "ErikW", "ReviewID": "R2J0ICR62AFG0C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a decent DSLR from Pentax and have been looking to replace my compact camera (Canon A620) that I can have with me at all times. It needs to produce very good image quality, but since the DSLR doesn't do video, it needs to excel at that.I heard from others about the Canon S95 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5, and research led me also to the Nikon P7000. One thing they all have in common is max HD video of 720p. While this is good enough with my present tv, my new tv will be 1080p. I don't want to buy another camera for at least 4-5 years.So I am glad to have heard about this model from Olympus, because in addition to the relatively large sensor and fast lens, it does 1080p HD videos. But for whatever reasons Olympus choose to use the avi format which limits you to 2GB (7 minutes).I could live with this, and do like the external mic option. But,  I'm glad there is another option I just found out on the Olympus website. In April they are coming out with a $399(street) SZ-30MR compact that does 1080p mp4.In addition, I'm being swayed by its DUAL TruePic(tm) III+ technology. No other compact camera captures HD movies and 16MP still images at the same time! Also they say you can shoot simultaneous wide-angle and telephoto movies, and full 1080p HD video and VGA movie files. RADICAL!It also has other latest technology like SMART PANORAMA, 3D stills, continuous auto tracking with brightness correction- even pet face detection.
