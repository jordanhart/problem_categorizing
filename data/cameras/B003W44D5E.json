The fact that it is pink is also nice.  She loves the after picture features where she can write things with the stylus on top of the picture and funny effects.  This is a great camera for someone that needs it to be small and easy to use with impressive results...", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "Sean M.

Well, I gave in, beside my better judgment. Auto focus is simply not good, no matter how still you keep the camera. Too many poor shots. Works much better outdoors in bright sunlight. Slow performance as well. Nice to have the panoramic function, but poor-quality pictures overall make this a no-buy.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZON POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!", "Author": "FABULOUS FEMALE \"FF\"", "ReviewID": "RZHUMYQRPO0YN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I cannot believe AMAZON sent me a USED camera. I am disappointed in the overall experience from ordering this camera to receiving it. There is no excuse that amazon can provide for providing such poor customer service. I will purchase my NEW camera from a SONY store.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Price change", "Author": "Dez", "ReviewID": "R3O98TPM5L83C2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this item 2 weeks ago and now the price has dropped over $15. When I contacted amazon to see if I could get the difference I was told to ship it back and reorder it, which of course makes no sense what so ever. I have a return window of 2 months and I think it would only be far to refund me that difference instead of making me go through the hassle of having to return the thing and reorder it. The Camera works ok although its alittle difficult to use and the manual isn't very explanitory. But it's cute and does its purpose.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.99", "Features": "Supplied Accessories - Rechargeable Battery (NP-BN1), Battery Charger, Multi Connector Cable, wrist Strap, Paint Pen, CD-ROMFeatures\nUltra-slim body\n3.0 Touch screen for easy focus selection & photo viewing\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x (25mm-equivalent) optical zoom lens\nOptical SteadyShot(R) image stabilization", "Name": "Sony T Series DSC-T99/P 14.1 Megapixel DSC Camera with Super HAD CCD Image Sensor (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Zc5C-26mL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003W44D5E"}}
