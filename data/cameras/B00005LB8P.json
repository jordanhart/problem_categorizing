Many digital camera reviews that you'll read will talk about how great digital cameras are <i>in general</i> (which they are), but I can tell you that this is an excellent model.  I recently traveled to Russia and Finland, and took this camera alone, and was very pleased.Compared to other cameras:+  The size.  It's so small, and feels dense and solid in the hand.  It'll fit in your pocket (jeans, even), and that's one of the best features of all.  This is a camera that you can carry anywhere.+  The images.  They are clear and color balance is good.+  The battery.  It's rechargeable, so pictures are truly free.  The charger is small and travels well.  Some folks say that it runs out too quickly; I haven't had that problem.  Some cameras require AA batteries.+  The lens cover.  It's built in and automatic, so you don't have to fool around.+  The zoom.  It has one (optical), which is good for framing pictures the way you want.+  The cycle time.  This camera will take a picture about once every two seconds, which is plenty.  Some cameras have a longer cycle time that borders on inconvenient.+  The choice of features.  This camera has the features that you need.  Don't waste money on digital zoom, lame image pre-processing, or sound clips.  And forget about the short, jerky movie clips.  Just take great photos.Here are some relatively minor irritations:-  My viewfinder doesn't center on the image.  So, I got in the habit of using the LCD display to view the shot.-  The USB port cover is a flimsy piece of rubber.-  You need to hold the 'on' button down for longer than feels necessary.-  To get good color balance, you'll want to set the camera setting for clouds, sun, or indoors, depending on the shot.  No joke.Here are some comments based on other reviews that I read:o  Some people thought that the flash was too weak.  I think it's fine.o  Some people said that the camera gets too hot.  It does get pretty warm, but it's fine.o  Some people said that the interface was confusing.  It's not exactly great, but I think it's acceptable.o  If you're going to throw away your 35mm like me, then you'll probably want to buy a spare battery and definitely at least a 64 MB card (minimum).  64 MB gets you 102 pictures at medium resolution.  That's like having three rolls of film, which barely got me through a two-week trip.  I found that I took more pictures with this camera than with my 35mm - even though I could delete the bad ones - because it's small, it's fun, and they're free.  No more $50 developing charges after each trip.", "Date": "November 29, 2001"}, {"Title": "Canon's Newest Elph Worth The Wait", "Author": "\"johnjim\"", "ReviewID": "RV0FOYL6I0NN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The next in the ultra-compact line of Canon Digital Elph cameras is finally shipping... and it's WAY cool!  Building on the success of the S100 and S300 predecessors,  the new digital Elph delivers improved picture quality, battery performance, and adds support for short segment videos.  Fotunately, Canon didn't mess with the rugged (and, yes, cool looking!) appearance - the S110 looks nearly identical the the S100.My only confusion is with the differences between the new S110 and the S300 model released earlier this year.  The S300 has a better optical zoom and is ever so slightly larger and heavier. The S300 also inexplicably adds a plastic ring around the lens which disrupts the sleek appearance of the otherwise all metal case.  The S300 is also a quite a bit more expensive.  It seems like the new S110 is a better deal unless you really need the extra optical zoom.The 8MB compact flash memory included with the S110 is almost insulting for a camera in this price range - Canon should be including at least a 16MB card.  I recommend you consider adding a 64MB or 128MB card as an option if your budget permits.  There are some excellent deals out there on compact flash memory right now.  Be careful,  the S110 only accepts Type 1 cards.If you're looking for a digital camera that you can carry with you,  and you're OK with the 2.11 megapixel resolution,  I suggest you add the S110 to your short list.", "Date": "June 5, 2001"}, {"Title": "Two Thumbs Up!!!", "Author": "Paul Chang", "ReviewID": "R1AF2U7UXLEI5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched and researched for my 1st Digi-Ca. I wanted something compact so that I can carry anywhere, easy to use, and has good photo quality. I narrowed my choice to Sony P1, Canon powershot S300, and S110.  After 3 weeks of researching, I decided not to go for Sony P1 due to various complaints in user sites.  The S300 and S110 are both compact and easy to use, and share the same CCD so there is no difference in photo quality. These are the difference I found: 1. The S300 is about $50-$100 more expensive. 2. The S300 has 3x optical zoom, while S110 has only 2x. 3. The S300 is not truly pocketable, compared to the tiny S110.Money was not a problem for me, so the deciding point was 3x zoom or ultra-portability. I went to Bestbuy and Circuit City to compare 3x zomm and 2x, and found out that there is only a minimal difference. (Just a step forward makes it 3x)  And also, I found S110 has better macro ability than S300. (Macro is the ability to take close-up pics.) I ordered S110; if I'm not satisfied with it, I was going to return it and get S300.  However, I'm so happy with it now, I am a keeper now.  The S300 is a great camera, but in my opinion S110 is better. Remember the reason you want to get a Canon digital ELPH is because of its ultra-portability.", "Date": "June 13, 2001"}, {"Title": "Expensive camera that's worth the bucks", "Author": "PB \"pratipb\"", "ReviewID": "R2WXH80XB4OIWZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the S-110 after having a film camera that I hadn't been using much in years. My first and primary concern was size - I wanted a camera that was small enough to carry around with me anywhere. This fit that bill well, and threw in a bunch of features that I love with it.Positive points:1. Extremely small - This camera is the perfect size. It's small enough to slip into your pocket and take into a bar or club (I got great pictures at a friend's birthday party at a club in SF), but it's large enough that you can easily hold it to take pictures.2. Great quality - 2.1 megapixels is the sweet point for digital cameras. The quality looks good on the screen, and looks good printed. You may notice slight quality degradation if you try to enlarge a photo to 8.5x11.3. Easy to use - Charge the battery and start clicking away. This camera is very easy to use, and you can hit the ground running with high quality pictures as soon as you've taken the time to charge your battery.4. Rich feature set - This camera has a great set of features for people that want to do a little more with their camera. This includes short video clip recording (more a novelty than anything else), white balance control, zoom, etc. I love the photostitch feature! You can take multiple pictures and stitch them together at the end. The S-110 helps you line up the pictures when you're taking them by showing you a little strip of the last picture you took, and the software does a great job of hiding seams!5. Good flash - I took pictures all night at a dark night club with no problems whatsoever.6. Rich supporting software - Both the image organization/download and photo editing software are easy to use and fairly rich.Negative points:1. No included case - I'm spending a lot of money for this camera, I think they can/should throw in a $5 (cost) case with it.2. Not much memory - Buy a 64MB or 128MB CompactFlash card. I went with the 128MB,and now I don't have to carry around an extra card with me.3. Battery life - You'll need to buy a second battery to complement your extra memory. One battery will let you take about 50 pictures.4. Poor zoom - Only 2x optical zoom (and another 2.5x digital zoom with loss of picture quality). The S-300 has more zoom, but you pay with a slightly larger camera body and a slightly higher price.ADDED SIDENOTE (10/13/01): I noticed that another review claims that this product cannot be used with USB hubs or if you have another USB devices attached. This is not the case for me - I have my S110 connected to my PC through the built in USB hub on my USB Microsoft Natural keyboard. I also have a mouse connected to the keyboard. I'm having no problems at all.", "Date": "July 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Tiny: good -- Dark: bad", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R34PX0SYPV8T4O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a Father's Day gift (I guess I was extra-good this year!). It is indeed very cool. The pictures are nice, and 2.1 megapixels is plenty, trust me.I've been a Nikon guy for a long time, and have invested many thousands in some good Nikon glass. And I resisted digital until I could somehow justify it.It's the size of this camera which makes it so great. I mean, a digital camera won't take the place of a good film camera anytime soon, regardless of number of pixels. If you simply compare the lens size, the focus ranges, and, perhaps most importantly, the dynamic range, you'll quickly learn that digital still has a ways to go to catch up with film.that's not to say that it doesn't have it's place: and snapshots are their place. You won't be blowing up your snapshots bigger than 5x7 (but ask yourself, when was the last time you actually blew up one of your pictures bigger than 5x7? Ever?) -- don't waste your money on a 3 megapixel.But CAUTION: this film has an ISO equivalent of 100. That means it's like always having 100 speed film in it: no way to make it go faster. The flash is tiny, pretty wimpy (effective range is <10 feet) and RIGHT NEXT TO the lens. What does that mean: your inside, night time photos will be less-than-stellar with lots of redeye.Hey, 100 speed film used to be the standard (and baseball games used to be played during the day), so it's not the end of the world. But anyone who says they're going to chuck their film camera for digital (especially this one) doesn't know how to use a film camera.All the same, I love this little guy. I'm going to carry it with me when it's not practical to carry my \"real\" camera. And I'm going to take lots and lots of pictures (at \"normal\" compression) which will all go on my website and as desktop backgrounds. It's fun. That's what it's about.Just try to lug around some Nikon 990 all the time: can't be done.

Unlike the Nikon, this Canon produces Great indoor pictures.  The flash is great.  Indoor pictures are true to color, and vivid.  Outdoor pictures are picture perfect, even better than I expected for a 2.1 M pix camera.  Even the movie mode is more than I expected although it will never replace a video camera. For quick movie clips it is just the thing.  Be sure to have Quick Time to view the movies because so far it is the only program I have found that works with the cameras movie mode.  Quick Time is a free download off the internet. Battery life is above expectations and recharge time is just around two hours.  The only thing a person needs to add is a larger compact flash card.  After owning a Nikon 900 and returning a Nikon 775 I am hooked with Canon.  Its very small size easily fits in the shirt pocket and the metal case gives it a very well built feeling. It even came with a coupon for a free battery, sling bag and 16 meg compact flash card.

When the S110 was introduced I simply fell in love. With one exception, the size, quality and features were far and away superior to the competition. The price point reflected that and I was convinced I could never afford one.Well, a recent series of events conspired to allow me to purchase the demo at a very reasonable price. I couldn't be happier. This is without a doubt the best digital camera for the general consumer on the market.The one weak point in the whole package is the 8MB compact flash card. A larger card (considering the falling prices of digital media) would be welcome. But the current mail-in offer from Canon helps rectify that. Until January 31, 2002, Canon is offering a free 16MB card, case and battery with a mail-in coupon.One of the features that I particularly like is the numbering system. The camera sequentially numbers the pictures without losing its place even if you reformat the card. That way you are not constantly forced to rename everything in you picture subdirectory every time you download from the camera (or compact flash card reader in my case).If you are looking for a well built close to top end digital camera, this should be at the head of your list.", "Date": "November 6, 2001"}, {"Title": "Ultra portability that packs a punch!", "Author": "Tony Desland \"Flyboy86\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y8N59JMFR17L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for close to four months now and have just returned from a trip to Europe.

The battery life wasn't a problem during my trip, although it would have been nice if this camera could take standard batteries as well.All in all this is one fantastic camera.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an ultra portable and pocketable camera without sacrificing picture quality.  The only potential drawback is the 8 MB CF card that comes with the camera.

(...)Okay, lets face it even if you spent $1500 on a top of the line digital camera it will never compare to a $400 Film SLR camera. And that's what i realized when i went to purchase a digital camera. Size of camera/quality/price were the deciding factors. so using this criteria i didn't want a bulky digital camera that wouldn't fit in my pocket.This ELPH turned out to produce extremely good resolution pictures. It has 3 resolutions and each resolution has 3 compression settings. I have hooked it up to both Mac and Wintel boxes with no problems. Plug and play is what this camera and software are all about. My friends were very impressed as well. there seems to be a large difference between 1 and 2 megapixel cameras. but the difference between 2 and 3 didn't appear to be as great. 2.1 megapixels are enough for most snap shots.I tried out the 360 degree panorama feature and it really is amazing how the software stiched the shots together. Very easy. your mother could probably do it. it was seamless stitching. it blew me away.Also it records movies with no stuttering. it saves them to the flash module in the AVI format. For a mac guy like me that was no problem AVI is compatible with any quicktime equipped Macintosh...and every mac comes with quicktime. The camera records sound too. but you cannot play back the movie with sound because there is no built in speaker. don't worry the sound is there and will easily download to your computer.One caveat, there does however appear to be a difference in composition when using the display to compose a shot versus the viewfinder. The viewfinder in inaccurate. But, I prefer the display instead so this is not a problem.Also to better appreciate this camera be sure to make the investment in a larger flash module. A 32MB module will allow you 31 pictures in 1600x1200 (largest resolution) Or 144 pictures in 640x480 ( the smallest resolution ). (...) even with this sale your still saving money and getting more than what i did from the good guys. BTW: I imagine this sale has something to do with a new generation of megapixel cameras coming soon. I would jump in on this one instead of waiting. this camera will still beat your cheapo film camera with the plastic lens, it even beats the film ELPH that i gave to my mother a few years back.If there is a longer life battery then get one too.

I work at a camera store.  Since these are the two cameras we sell the most of, I wanted to see for myself which one took better pictures.  I tripod mounted each one and made the settings the same:  auto white balance, high resolution JPEG possible, no flash, timer exposure (as to avoid camera shake).  I printed out an 8x10 of each (which is about as big as you'd want to go with a 2mp camera).  They weren't color corrected, just straight prints.  The Canon was visibly sharper, and the white balance had been much more accurately corrected than the Nikon had.  All of the lighting in the store is flourescent.  Without a flash, pictures taken under florescent light tend to come out yellow.  The picture from the Nikon was a lot more yellow and a lot darker.  The Canon, although not *perfect*, looked much more true to life.  Of course you can always fix this on the computer, but the fact remains, the auto white balance on the Canon worked better.The three advantages the Nikon has over the Canon are:  better macro, slightly bigger zoom and the ability to use a 2CR5 lithium battery (and not *just* the rechargable it comes with).  Other than that, the Canon is in my opinion is better in every way.  If you do want a Canon with a bigger zoom, check out the S300 (you get a bigger zoom, but keep in mind the body is a little bigger than the S110).Canon's software is better, plus the body is metal and very well crafted.  Highly recommended for someone looking for a travel sized camera and not requiring prints larger than 8x10.", "Date": "December 13, 2001"}, {"Title": "Spectacular Little Box!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RB56GASK93WFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I just want to say that this was I think the best buy I could have made, considering the options.  When I first started looking into my next digital camera I went straight to the BAD reviews.  My other option was the [similarly priced] Sony DSC-P50.  Let's just say that compared to the competition, the Canon has practically NO real flaws.First of all, someone commented (about the Canon S110) that the USB connectivity is a big problem.  Yes, but no *real* problem (remember, it uses flash cards).  True, when I installed the USB drivers to my Win2K machine it kicked off my HP PhotoSmart 1000.  So I just went via route #2.  Don't even use the USB connectivity (you don't need it!)- either use a USB compactflash card reader (VERY cheap) or, as I do, just throw the universal compactflash card from the Canon into the compactflash card reader in your USB printer, access it from Windows Explorer and whammo!Second bad thing that I read about the camera was that its metal case didn't make it any more durable.  Well, that's not really an issue because I don't know many people who expect their small, expensive tech toys to be \"durable\".  It's not that hard to make sure you don't damage it.  No issue.And the third was that the flash was pathetic and that its speed was the equivalent of ISO 100.  Unless you want to light up an entire building, the power of the flash is PLENTY.  It even takes, in my opinion, GREAT pictures with the flash TURNED OFF in dark areas (I'd like to see a film camera hold up to this).  If you really want to light up a football field, then you need external lighting anyway!  I've had NO issues with the flash OR speed.  Even though it's the equiv of ISO 100, I think it adds a little artsy/realistic touch to images.  Especially car lights streaking by at night.POSITIVES: It's conveniently small, takes GREAT resolution (1600x1200/8\"x10\") shots, both the audio and video quality on the movie function (AVIs) are GREAT, contrary to what I've heard the battery life is actually fantastic (I can use it all day w/o recharging), the menus and controls are easy to understand (I never read the manual until after I figured everything out!), the direct audio/video output from the camera is a glorious thing, the included software will let you edit the AVIs and convert to MOVs and MPGs, it uses compactflash cards which are cheap and universal with printers and PocketPCs and... what you get for the same price you'd pay for a Sony (features, quality AND accessories in-the-box) is fabulous!(...).

Be aware there are some expensive cameras that can give you good resolution and imaging and there are some cheap ones which I wouldn't even use as a snapshot to email to my mother. Recently, I borrowed this camera from a friend to use to take some macro snapshots of an orchid. Next paycheck, I bought the camera for myself.The S110 offers many things that you'd find in any 2.x megapixel camera. I'm going to skip the obvious benifits of this camera (the small size, the good looks, cheap removable storage, etc.) and focus on the other reasons to get this camera over others.+ The CCD and the compression are sharp. Really clear. Under all uses of this camera on high res and medium compression, I noticed little to no artifacts (even zoomed in Photoshop) of the compression or the CCD. Further, the images (at any resolution) require little to no post color correction.+ The camera has a manual mode which lets you move the exposure (+/- 2 stops!), adjust for lighting varience (even tungsten or florescent light), plus several flash modes and a macro & infinity focus. Simple as that. Snap a picture -- twiddle some manual settings -- snap another picture. I can bracket shots! What an happy discovery!+ The camera also has a \"stitch assist\" mode, where you can tile several photographs. They aren't actually combind until you download the images and the software realized they need to be stitched by itself. The auto-stitch software works really well...though I'd still go to photoshop for delicate work...but for snapshots and prints it's excellent.+ The zoom is shallow, 2x max optical, but by doing so the apature is fairly large (2.8f) so you get more light for better pictures (and the camera is small and light too!). After 2x you can digital zoom as much as 5x which loses some effective resolution, but if you just have to zoom it works pretty well. Don't worry either, the flash will shoot to provide the extra light to remove some of the grain.Like any camera, you have to know how to shoot with it to get used to its behavior, so you'll know when to switch the flash (it shoots a bit bright for some indoor macro work, but hold some tissue paper over the flash and you'll be fine) mode or set the white balance off auto -- but within a day I figured the entire thing out and took some great images with some sharp detail.The really great thing is, you can just leave the S110 on full auto and get comparably as excellent results.This camera is worth every penny and more.", "Date": "July 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "Terrific camera, with a few quirks", "Author": "Todd Ihrig", "ReviewID": "R28PBMJP4CTIKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, this camera is terrific.  This is my first digital camera and I compared extensively before purchasing.  In addition to the Amazon customer reviews, be sure to check out the reviews at Digital Photography Review (...).General camera operations are a breeze and relatively easy to maneuver with the tiny size of this engineering marvel.  I was a bit worried because I have big hands, but it is well-designed.  The images are amazingly clear, crisp with bright, accurate colors.  Naturally, the quality of the final image will depend on the settings.  One piece of advice I received from many sources - let the camera take the photos at the highest resolution it can muster.  You can always remove detail with software, but you can't add detail back in.(...) I just want to add one comment about some quirks on the menu system.  Often, it takes one more button press than you would think to accomplish a task.  For example, to delete a photo in playback mode, you press \"menu\" to bring up the menu bar, \"set\" to select single-image delete, \"set\" again to bring up the deletion confirmation, \"right-arrow\" to move to \"OK\" and one final \"set\" to delete.  Phew!  I can understand the confirmation, but it would be nice to have an option to default to \"OK\" rather than \"Cancel\"... and I'm not sure why it requires two presses of \"set\" right at the beginning.Another weird thing... let's say you just took a photo and want to delete it right away (no use wasting space on the CF card if you can tell the shot was bad, right?).  The image displays for 2-seconds (or 10-seconds, if you choose), but rather than just hitting the \"set\" button during the review period to bring up the delete confirmation, you have to... (ready for this?!) ...1) Hold the shutter release down continuously after taking the shot;2) Press and hold the \"set\" button;3) Press the \"left-arrow\" button to bring up the delete confirm.Now that doesn't quite sound so bad, but think about the size of this thing and the tiny buttons - this takes a bit of maneuvering (not to mention the foresight to hold the shutter down - something not natural when taking photos).  I'm not quite sure why you can't just hit the \"set\" button to hold the image temporarily and then delete or continue shooting.  Somebody clearly didn't think that one through.Anyway, like I said... a couple of weird quirks in an otherwise terrific package.  Clean design, solid feel - and great photos.

The main reason I didn't take pictures before getting a film Elph was the hassle of carrying a bulky camera. The Elph eliminates this issue completely. I can carry a camera anywhere in any pocket and be ready for every occasion. The Elph's construction is solid as a rock on both the regular and digital versions.I can't speak highly enough about the digital Elph S110 camera. It is compact and solid. The internal software was my main concern, but once I read the detailed review of how the camera software worked, with pictures of every screen and function, at the dpreview.com site, I knew this camera was the one for me.Act soon for 2 reasons: 1 - this model seems to be in short supply; and 2 - you can get a free second battery, carry case, and additional memory card until the end of the month as a special promotion from Canon. This eliminates the 2 main issues: wanting a case to protect the view screen on the back, and wanting an extra battery ($... value) so you have a spare.The picture quality if phenomenal. The movie mode is very cool too. I didn't think I would use it but it's great to take a little 10 second clip and the motion reproduction is very good. The sound is very good also. As noted in some other reviews, the only flaw here is that you can't hear the audio on replays in the camera because there is no audio jack on the camera.I was concerned about getting a 2.1 mega pixel now that you can get 3, 4, and 5 mega pixel camera's but trust me, 2.1 meg is enough. It takes 1600x1200 photos that are so crisp and clear you can print an excellent 8x10 easily. And I don't know about you, but I have never had a photo blown up larger than 8x10.I recommend that you get a 128MB card. They are down to about $... bucks and one card will hold over 128 shots at the max size with max quality (superfine) (about 900KB per shot). If you use the next quality level, fine, each shot averages about 500KB. At that rate a 128MB card will hold over 240 shots. That's enough to last a whole vacation. Movie clips of the maximum 10 second duration at the medium 320x240 mode take up about 4MB each.Lastly, the included software while not the best, is very good, and the synch/download from the camera is seamless. Attach the camera to the PC and up pops the transfer program. Click the button for whichever type of copy/download option you want, and presto, there they are.", "Date": "January 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "Surprise: great for scanning photos, too", "Author": "Gary Friedman", "ReviewID": "R24P83CY6UPGV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this awesome little toy on Friday night, and realized that I need a copy of my invoice for the rebate.

Ok, the resolution is pretty poor and you can't zoom but it's fun to get somebody blasting out of a chute -- 15 seconds of video is fine for this.  It doesn't replace a video camera, but a few clips along with still pictures is great.  Audio is good enough to catch skier comments as they pass by.  Also, unlike with a bulky video camera, people don't know that you're \"filming\".  3)  The \"stitch\" option to take panoramic pictures.

The \"movie mode\" of the S110 seemed gratuitous, like a kids' novelty add-on.  But then I went to Canon's website and noticed that the S100 had been released in May 2000 and had been replaced a year later by the S110 which, it is claimed, also has a slightly better lens and longer-lasting battery.  Given the negligible price spread between the two cameras...along with the identical weight and dimensions, common sense dictated taking the S110 over its older but not bigger sister.

The overall feel and construction of the camera is also very solid.The only few drawbacks that I have found with this camera is that the included 8MB flashcard is a joke. If you're only considering taking just a handful, and I mean a handful of pics, then by all means it will do the job, but if you want more images like so many of us buying this camera do, then I suggest opting for a 64MB or higher card. (Cost Co has 64MB SanDisk flashcards...) Second no case came with the camera. I had to dish out ... extra [money]to pick up an APS Elph Jr case from a local camera shop. It fits perfectly though. Lastly, battery life could be better. On average I'm getting about 60 images before it goes dead. The low battery warning goes on too late.

The autofocus is reliable, and the optical zoom is good.  The camera takes 2 megapixel photos, which come out really clear on a computer, and I am told will print out at photo quality at sizes up to 8\" x 10\".  The Elph has a lot of fun features.  Some, like delayed photos, are key, others, like video capture, are not as serious, but still fun.  If you really want to take digital videos, this will take grainy, 40-second videos.  Otherwise, I might go for the Kodak, which doesn't take video, but has even better picture quality (see below).  Cons:  It's a drag that Canon used a proprietary battery, instead of AAs like some other digitals (Kodak).  You need to pay big $$ for spare batteries, and if you run out of power, forget about going to the corner store for some emergency batteries.  You will need more memory cards (8 mb isn't nearly enough), and will probably need spare batteries and carrying case.  I'm told that if you want to use specialty lenses, it's kind of a pain.  Bottom Line:  Overall, the Elph S110 a great camera, but I think the Kodak DX3900 is a better buy for the money.  The Kodak takes 3 megapixels instead of 2.  It takes AA batteries instead of the weird Cannon battery, and I think it uses the \"easyshare\" dock to download photos instead of USB.  The Cannon is smaller and better looking and takes short videos.  Unless one of those features is critical to you, I think Kodak's got the advantage at this price level.", "Date": "January 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Small but Powerfull", "Author": "\"nccmbc\"", "ReviewID": "R24RSBSUI9GQFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the PowerShot S100, identical to the S110 without the mpeg feature, for nearly eight months, and it's truly amazing.  But I'll say this, the camera has the ability to produce stunning pictures that push the technical limitations if its design, however you need to know what your doing.  Learning isn't difficult, unlike film camera's in which you must pay for the film, pay to have it developed (whether you do it yourself or not) and wait an extended amount of time to see the result, digital offers you the ability to learn by trial and error in a short period of time.  The unparalleled part is that you can experiment with different settings in an environment and see the results instantly, making slight adjustments until you like the result.  When you have finally learned what the camera can and cannot do, have improved your own artistic ability and honed your powers of observation and awareness of your environment, the true fun begins...Once your ready, you can turn off the LCD display and flash, and have nearly unlimited shooting times off one battery.  I have taken as many as 148 pictures on a single charge, and could probably do more if use of the LCD is further restrained.  Ignore the manual and the software; the PowerShot's can take any size Compact Flash card.  There is only one beaf, and it can be a disaster...Canon includes a software program called ZoomBrowser EX, it's a very convient program to download, sort, and archive your photos. There are better programs, but this one includes an interface with the camera that allows you to change internal settings, list functions, and monitor settings.  It's works flawlessly with just a few pictures, but when you get up around 5000 like myself (don't laugh, it doesn't take long, buy a CD-ROM burner if you don't have one already) it can turn on you in a heartbeat.  So I'll include just a few tips I have learned, but it will all depend on your software version, your computer hardware, and how much you push the software to give up the goods.Make sure you sort ALL your photo's into folder's, name them whatever you want, but you must break up the pictures, you cannot dump 800 pictures into the main folder and expect the program to function long.  The slide show feature will prove this time and time again.  It had caused me to reinstall the program half a dozen times before I understood what NOT to do.  When viewing a slide show, select an entire folder from a main folder, do not select individual pictures unless you keep it under 40 or so, it will lock up and it will kill the program.  If you do it by mistake and it looks like it's locked up, leave it, let it run for hours if you have to, it sometimes will recover.  But if you stop it, it may not start again.  Now, you don't lose your pictures, just the ability to view them in ZoomBrowser.  You can rebuild from scratch, but it takes time.

How much memory do I need? Can I connect it to my home computer? Fortunately, there's the Canon PowerShot S110, one of the best consumer digital cameras on the market. It's portable (the size of a deck of cards), durable, very easy-to-use and takes professional quality pictures (2.1 mega-pixels). Even at the camera's lowest resolution, 640x480, snapshots look of film-quality. Moreover, it's a cinch to connect the camera to your computer. But portability and mega-pixels are not the only things to look for. The PowerShot S110 powers on in a mere 3 to 4 seconds -- unlike most digital cameras -- allowing the user to take pictures at a moment's notice. In addition, the camera boasts an easy-to-navigate on-screen menu -- again, unlike most digital cameras -- so that you can view your snapshots and change settings on the fly. Overall, the PowerShot S110 is a very good value. It comes with all the features that you need, and all the gadgetry  that you crave: all at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it. (One note: the PowerShot S110 comes with about 8 MB of memory, meaning that you can store in the camera about 4-8 high-resolution photos or about 32-35 low-resolution photos.

Besides being too big and heavy to carry around comfortably (and thus, collecting dust in a drawer somewhere), it just never seemed worth the expense.  All too often, I ended up spending money on a roll of film that took forever to finish, spent some more money on developing, and then ended up hating the majority of shots.  And maybe I lack an artistic soul or something, but that rare shot that I ended up loving was never worth the money I spent on all the others.However, this camera was more than worth it.This Elph is a tiny marvel-sleek, compact, light, and feature rich-sure to keep casual users like myself happy.  I can take it anywhere with me, and take all sorts of shots in all kinds of lighting.  Its intuitive interface (I used it right out of the box), dozens of options, crisp LCD screen, decent software package, direct print capability (it connects directly to Canon's CP-10 and soon-to-be-released CP-100 card photo printers) and easy USB connectivity, makes this a great toy for those who want to take, email and/or print pictures simply, easily, and without breaking the bank.But it's not for everyone.  Serious photographers, especially those who want to print 8\" x 10\" prints or larger, may want to consider Canon's professional G-Series or S40 or S30, all of which are larger and heavier (as well as more expensive) but have more megapixels, are capable of greater resolutions, and have options I've never heard of (or wouldn't know how to use even if I did).  The camera's 2.1 megapixels and 5x zoom is enough for me, but I'm not earning an income off the shots I take either.If you do buy this, however, I definitely second getting an extra set of batteries and a larger CF card.  While I've never run out of batteries yet (they have a pretty long life and recharge quickly), nothing is more painful than missing a priceless shot because you can't turn your camera on.  I've certainly come close enough to appreciate the comfort of an extra set of batteries in my bag, just in case.  Likewise, nothing hurts more than the knowledge that you may have to start deleting shots to get others-which you will if you stick with the measly 8MB card included with the camera.  Memory's cheap nowadays, so do yourself a favor and get some.  You'll regret it if you don't.Because to be frank, this camera is not going to be making friends with the dust bunnies.  Chances are, you'll be so charmed that you'll be slipping this thing in your backpack or purse (or back pocket of your jeans) most days of the week.  You'll be using it all the time, and it pays to get the accessories that will make using it for extended periods a lot easier.  Otherwise, you may find yourself spending a lot more money and time going home several times a day to upload the pictures on your CF card or recharge your batteries.And while all that additional exercise might be useful, it's a lot less fun than taking pictures with your Elph.

An interesting fact left out of all manuals, internal documentation and external reviews I've been able to find; interesting to me because I have two Epson printers.  But after being unable to figure out how to select a printer and print a picture in ImageBrowser, I called Customer Support, only to be told this dirty little secret.  Seems truly bizarre given that Epson is a major manufacturer of ink jet printers.And, yes, sure it's not the greatest image software available, but it's more than adequate for many needs, especially since plugging the cam into the USB port auto-starts ImageBrowser.

The prints look fantastic. The colors are rich. The flash is robust. And I can snap off shots much faster than my Mavica. The installation was a bit of a trial, but that may be because my computer has always had USB port difficulties.I'm tempted to also buy the S40 for its speed, zoom and resolution, but it's probably going to be a long time because I'm so happy with this little wonder.Oh, yeah, I was worried about the 100-150 ASA speed,  the 2.5X zoom, and the 2.1 megapixels, but, in truth, the package is superb. The zoom winds up to be 5x with the digital interpretation, and the quality remains high. The flash is so good, that indoor shots look bright and rich. And 2.1 megapixels with the superior white balance and electronics in this camera are more than enough for a good 8 x 10.The really remarkable thing about the Elph is its size and relative quality. Sure, there are more powerful cameras but they're bigger. I've got a wonderful Nikon 35mm film camera at home that I never take anywhere because it just doesn't fit in a pocket. That's the whole thing.Buy this camera and then decide if you need something more powerful. But you absolutly must have a great camera at this size.Problems: Ok...the screen icons are very small. You can differentiate among them, but many do not easily communicate their function because their small size makes the graphic hard to decipher.  The included 8 Mb card is nearly useless. Get a 128 Mb. card and forget about cards.  Also, get a card reader. It will be a nice change from using the camera cable which is just a little difficult to remove from the port because you've got to press on a button that isn't easily depressed.

The S110 is definitely one of the best products I have seen in the consumer market.The size of this camera is very small, it even beats APS cameras! When the lens is retracted, the camera is basically a box-like metalic package. This beats many other digital cameras that are trying to use odd shapes to catch attention. This rectanglar shape is great for storing in a pocket or a bag.There is never enough memory nor battery. However, I have found the included battery quite capable for its size. Afterall, there isn't much room to put any battery! If you want to maximize battery endurance, turn off the LCD display whenever possible and use the viewfinder to find your view. The LCD itself draws very little power, but the backlight is a power hog.As for memory, you can get a 128M compact flash card for about $... to $... The camera lets you choose three picture qualities. My advice is to choose the \"normal\" resolution unless you are really trying to capture details. Pictures of people and pets can easily use the normal mode. Landscape and flowers probably deserve the extra memory for details.The user interface is easy enough. The zoom buttons also double as thumbnail/picture/detail selector in playback mode (makes sense). In camera mode, flash, macro/infinity and exposure mode have one-key access, while picture quality, shooting mode and exposure compensation require a few key presses. This arrangement makes the camera excellent for point-and-shooting, while still leaving some flexibility for more creative endeavors.This camera really stands out from the rest exactly because its look is modest, but the attention to details is peerless (and potential peers include Nikon and Sony).

I read rave reviews,  Initially, I loved it.  What a great camera!!!  But then I felt differently.Well, I've had the camera quite some time now, and it's going on eBay this week.  Here's why:1.  When on for a while, the case gets hot.  And I mean HOT.  At first, I thought it was just a minor thing, but it actually gets a bit uncomfortable.2.  The battery pack stinks.  It doesn't last long, and extra batteries are outrageous to buy.  I want a camera that uses AA or AA rechareables.  At least I can replace those batteries for much less money if one goes bad.3.  The 2\" LCD display makes you think images are closer than they appear, but when you snap the pic, lo and behold, the images are much farther away.  You have cut off the top of people's heads and feel in order to get a good close shot.  The viewfinder is a bit better.4.  My biggest problem about this camera is the long, long delay to snap a picture!!  I have missed every instantaneous shot since I have owned it.  You just can't \"point and click\".  Now I really don't know if this is a symptom of all digitals, but I am told that it is not.  I have a young son, who won't sit more than a fraction of a second, and I swear every shot his eyes are half open or head twisted the wrong way.  The long shutter time is a real nuisance.5.  The small size, in my opinion, is a great grab.  \"Hey, drop it in your pocket, take it anywhere\".  At first inspection, that seems true, but guess what, you can't just \"drop it in your pocket\".  What are you going to do?  Sit on it?  And a shirt pocket?  Forget it.  It weighs too much, and is annoying.  Small size means small buttons means small LCD screen.  In this case, I've decided that a little bigger is a lot better.  Think twice before you get sucked in like I did.Anyway, I hope this honest review from someone whose had this camera for a while helps steer those wary buyers to another model.Othewise, is small is driving you, this is the one.  And 2.1Giga resolution is stellar!!!  For the average joe (like me), any higher resolution is probably throwing money away.", "Date": "September 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Absolutely No Regrets!", "Author": "Molly Chen", "ReviewID": "RLO21OHJTPH8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially have the S100 Digital ELPH, which is the previous model from the new S110.  During my purchase of the S100, I've compared it with the PowerShot S10 and S20 and settled for the ELPH for its size and convenience (also after reading numerous online reviews, both Canon and other brands, like this one that I'm now writing).  The size IS indeed proved very convenient, and I've taken it everywhere, and the camera itself is very easy to use.  The only regret I have with the old S100 is that the image setting only comes in Large (1600 x 1200 pixels) superfine, fine, and Small (640 x 480) fine.  I wished for a size setting in between or at least a superfine for size small (which the S10 and S20 has, but I still went for the ELPH, which was a satisfying decision).  During this time, newer cameras are coming out with the movie clip function, which was also very alluring.Finally, Canon came out with S110, and all the features are just PERFECT for what I've been longing for!  It was a prayer answered, so I sold my S100 and got the new S110 and could not be happier.  It has all three sizes, Large, Medium, and Small, each with all three superfine, fine, and normal compression settings (like how the S10 and S20 has it).  It has been a while since I looked at the newer cameras that are now coming out, but I am so satisfied with my S110 that I am not planning to shop for another digital camera in any time soon.  I am sure the newer PowerShot series have more updated functions, but as of now, I am going to be very happy with my ELPH.  Friends have also used my S110, and they all really like it.The Fuji FinePix came out with several models that are small and very sleek looking.  When I saw a friend using one, I was very intrigued and started semi-researching and semi-shopping for it.  What I found was that even though they are very attractive, the FinePixes don't have optical zoom, which is why they weigh even less then the Digital ELPH.  Optical zoom comes from actual real lenses on the camera, and digital zoom is? well, \"digital,\" which sacrifices the quality of the picture.  The more digital zoom you use, the blurrier the picture gets.  The Digital ELPH has 2 x Optical (and still has 2.5 x digital), while the FinePix only has digital (confession: I don't know for sure that FinePix doesn't have any models with optical zoom, but just from the ones I've seen online and what people generally have, they don't).  Some people will think a 2 x optical zoom is too little (especially those who're used to film cameras with a lot of zoom), but judging for the ELPH's size, it is actually quite decent.  For those who want more zoom, mini cameras are not the choice, since the more zoom you get, the more lenses you need, the more room you need on the camera, the larger the camera gets.  The amount of optical zoom is also a big factor in the camera's price (hey, lenses cost).Another thing when shopping for digital cameras is its resolution.  I am concerned that people who don't quite understand that generally think the more resolution (2.1 megapixel, 3.1 megapixel, etc.) the better.  The resolution is the size of the pictures you take, 1600 x 1200, 640 x 480, etc.  If your purpose is to enlarge or print out a picture that is large (poster size?), yes, you need high resolution.  But if you just want to print basic 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 sizes, even the 1.2 megapixels are enough.  2.1 mp gives you clear printouts up to something a bit larger than your regular letter size paper.  And for everyday use, I set my camera to the small size (640 x 480) with superfine compression (settings can be changed in seconds while you're shooting).  I prefer a manageable picture size but I still want clear details (so I am very happy with S110 that came with superfine for the smaller resolutions).  For webpage users, you want your pictures to be smaller and as little memory size as possible.  The point I'm trying to get across is that you should understand your purpose in getting the camera (print out large pictures vs. something easy to handle for small printouts or webpages), and don't go out and get the highest resolution you can find, thinking the bigger the number the better.Bottom line, I am very satisfied with the new S110 for my needs and uses.  It is small enough to carry everywhere, but enough power for taking very good pictures (I mean, I'm a casual user taking pictures for leisure.  Professional photographers are a different story?).  Of course, digital cameras have their downside of not having enough flash for night and dark places, which many users have commented.  Quick movements are not taken as well as regular cameras, unless your digital has settings for...? what do you call it?  Umm? films have different types of 100, 200, and 400 choices?  Some digital cameras with more options have these choice settings.Regardless of all this (well, not that many really), I am still nowhere near changing my decision in purchasing this camera.  You probably can get similar digital cameras with other brands for less, since Canon does have the reputation for being slightly pricier than some others.  But personally, I think my money is well spent and well worth it.  Buying something that you are satisfied with (within reasonable price range, of course) is better than settling for something cheaper but will bring you regrets and complaints.

The CF card recorded photos/movies as being taken but there was no view or quick review on the LCD (just blank) and the actual image of each photo, when viewed on the CF card, was a black blank one.  Oddly, the audio portion of mini-movies did record but no images.(2) Canon customer support was non-existant.

They told me I would have to return it to them for service and that I would have to package, insure and return it at my own expense and inconvenience.

After watching my old roommate's camera eat through AA's like you wouldn't believe, I decided any camera would have to have a rechargeable battery.  The Elph's battery is a tiny little lightweight powerhouse. Charges in 3hours, for me will take about 100 pictures before requiring a recharge.

The unit comes with a recharger, which is the size of the camera and plugs directly into a wall socket - very compact.SIZE. This is truly incredible. It will honestly fit in your shirt pocket .

There was no flash glare.The batteries allow for about 50 photos (LCD on) including download time. Canon claims 85 with LCD on and over 250 with LCD off but having the LCD on permits the photographer to see the photos as he or she takes them and delete right then whichever ones are not to their liking.

At the same time, I ordered a 128 MB Compact Flash for $80, as I knew that the included 8 MB card was just too small.In this review, I'm going to concentrate on using this camera with an iBook. This should apply to using it with any USB capable Mac.After taking a few pictures, I opened my iBook (a spring 2001 dual USB model running Mac OS 9.1), inserted the supplied CD, installed Canon's software and restarted. I turned on the camera, slid the switch to put the camera into review mode, and plugged the supplied cable into the IO port of the camera and a USB port on the iBook. This cable is most definitely not a standard USB cable, so treat it well. Canon's Image Browser software automatically detected the camera being plugged in and launched.The pictures in the camera are shown as thumbnails in a scrolling pane which looks like a long strip of film. You can select the ones you like, rotate them, delete them or choose to upload them to your computer's hard drive. Be sure to rotate them if need be before uploading them. Uploading is quite fast for USB. Photos in your photo directory are shown as larger thumbnails in another window. Double clicking on an image opens it up into its own window where you can do simple cropping and exposure/color adjustments. If you want to do anything serious though, I'd recommend finding a copy of Color It! or even spending the big bucks on Photoshop.I haven't used the movie capture feature extensively, but it works. It generates .AVI files which QuickTime plays easily enough.Rebooting into Mac OS X (10.1) and plugging the camera in, the Apple provided Image Capture application automatically launches and allows you to download and rotate images quickly and easily.The pictures it takes are very good. Changing settings take a while to get used to. The neighborhood kids love playing with it. The rechargeable battery is a great feature as it makes picture taking pretty much free.In sum, this camera fulfilled almost all of my needs and I highly recommend it for general, nonprofessional use.", "Date": "July 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "very happy with new S110", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2IGXKSGCH0919", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera hits the spot.

The battery life is rather short, and the camera does NOT come with a power adapter so that you can use the camera while it is charging.

The photos also tend to have a yellow tint, which can easily be fixed with an editing software, but if you aren't too fimilar with photoshop or programs like it, you will have a yellow tint to many of your pictures.  The images load quickly onto the computer.  Memory life is good, if you set your image resolution to the lowest size you can store up to 80 or so photos.

It's not perfect. Pictures come out a bit yellow when taken indoors. The flash overexposes a bit. Pictures aren't as sharp as the G1. But I love this camera. I can throw it in my pocket or purse and it's always available. It is easy to use and starts up pretty quickly. It's small, but not so small that the buttons are hard to use. The case is durable and controls intuitive. I also have the water resistant case and use this camera while kayaking and snorkeling. I love popping out the memory card and having the instant gratification of pictures I can see. I love sharing my pictures on the net.I have a Canon G1 and I've had various Nikons and Sonys both digital and film cameras. The G1 beats this S110 for image quality but I don't like to carry it around. I've had one of these cameras for over a year. It's the most fun camera I ever owned.Addendum: A word of advice:  don't bother with Canon's drivers.  Get a small usb reader for the memory card and if you have Windows 2000/xp or a Mac the operating system will automatically detect the pictures and you can easily copy them over.  Canon's Image Browser is of value if you have a G1 or G2 and take pictures in RAW mode because you need to convert them, but for this camera you'll be a lot better off not bothering with Image Browser and using other Photoediting software.", "Date": "August 30, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent small camera, great for FOOD CLOSE-UPS", "Author": "Michael A.

Then we post them on our web site, along with food notes and restaurant commentary.The PowerShot 110 is a great camera for this. It's small enough that it sits on the table unobtrusively, not getting in the way of what is usually too many plates and glasses.More importantly, it takes very clear close-ups of the food, something our previous digital camera had a lot of problems with. The difference is the low-light focus assist; it's a small beam of light that the camera can emit and shine on the subject, which helps it focus the lense in low-light situations -- extremely common in restaurants, especially the nice ones. And it has a Macro (close-up) mode, which also helps.Another problem we had with our previous camera was over-flashing. Even on the lowest setting, we had to cover the Mavica's flash partially with our finger to take a picture that wasn't over-exposed. The PowerShot is much better at using the right flash level, and not over-exposing our food.", "Date": "August 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Significant improvement over the S100", "Author": "P.

I've had it for many months now, but it didn't take long for me to discover that the image quality that this camera produces is superb!  It gives vivid, natural colors with crisp edging.Next, I looked for usability.  Unless you purposefully go into the advanced options, it works just like a standard camera - point and shoot (new users sometimes have problems because they don't hold down the shutter button correctly; first, hold half-way to focus, then the whole way to take the picture).  Plus, as it so small, it's very portable.Two upgrades you should get with this camera: an extra battery and more memory.  Its 8MB of memory included is insufficient (only 8 high-quality pictures) and leaves much to be desired (as most digital cameras' memory sold today do).  I got a 128MB card (perhaps a little excessive).  But, now that picture capacity isn't holding you back, you'll find the battery will.  The S110's battery is so small, though, than an extra in your pocket isn't an inconvenience at all.This digital photo system can't be beat.  Easily load pictures onto your computer, print to your printer (glossy photo paper can do wonders), or simply send them to Ofoto.com (...) to be professionally developed.  This camera also has some advanced features that work very well, go to canon.com to look into those.  Picking and choosing which pictures get physically developed (if any) saves money compared to traditional cameras.  Plus, it's always nice to know that a picture turned out well while you still have a chance to take it again with the camera's LCD display.

Let me post a few complaints to encourage Canon to perfect the product:- Movie mode stops at either 4, 10, or 30 seconds depending on the resolution. Other cameras can film continously until you run out of memory.- There is an annoying delay between the time you press the shutter and the time the picture is taken.

Its menu system is not the most intuitive to use, but once you get the hang of it you can flip through the option screens easily. One draw back is that the screen all but disappears in bright sunlight, but what camera doesn't? The second draw back is that you can only take video clips for about 10-15 seconds at a time.

And of course the advantages of digital, being able to see the shot immediately so you can take it again if you flubbed.

The software works well. The color accuracy is flawless with good resolution.

I use this mostly for indoor shots with flash.More than half the photos have oversaturated color to the point where I have to desaturate many of them before showing them. Also, about one out of 10 photos is out of focus.My monitor is adjusted so that most digital photos I see from my other digital camera as well as on the web look normal. No gamma correction is applied.When previewing photos on the camera in the zoom mode, it is very difficult to move the photo up and down because you have to hold down one key while pressing another key that's 5 mm apart.Red-eye reduction works, still a little bit of redeye remains.Although not as good as I have hoped, I still carry this camera with me everywhere until I find something better in this size.", "Date": "December 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Looking, Easy to Use and Great Results", "Author": "Daniel Politeski", "ReviewID": "R2WNGXAQHFTCM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just giving my few cents on the S110 Powershot.
