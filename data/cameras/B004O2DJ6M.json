I am a photographer currently in school and have been using this camera for two years now. The reason I gave the kit 4 stars instead of 5 is because the tripod batteries and sd card leave room for improvement. The tripod is rather flimsy, the batteries only last about a third as long as the canon brand battery, and the sd cards are slow and not for someone who has a shutter finger. That being said, for the price this kit is amazing and perfect for starting out! I do suggest getting a remote for the camera as well. The one below is inexpensive and still works after 3 years.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTSHY8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Greg Smith", "ReviewID": "R1DE22S6NPC4AX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera bundle was a great deal for the price.
