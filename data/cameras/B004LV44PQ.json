I was wrong, much of what I read about this camera came to be true. I purchased the Sealife Mini II camera and it did ship quickly (thank you House of Scuba). However, everything went south from there. This is suppose to be a 9MP camera. If that is the case, it must have the bottom of a coke bottle for a lens. Image quality was on par with your average phone camera. NO BETTER. Yes, I too had the same problem with the battery meter going screwy and yes, mine too died while on my vacation. The camera is less than a month old and simply stopped working. Was camera - now brick. Not sure what the issue is with Sealife, the product had so much to offer and filled a perfect niche but it fails to meet even the lowest of marks. Note to Sealife Mgt - If you want to stay in business - you are going to have to do better.The Sealife brick, errrr, I mean camera has been returned. House of Scuba willing took it back.

But that was the least of my problems.Over the course of 7 days and a total of 14 dives to depths ranging from 20 to 119 ft, the camera's performance was subpar to say the least. On three separate occasions, right in the middle of a dive, the camera suddenly displayed a \"card error\" message and quit working. I wish I could comment on battery life but it was all over the charts. One minute it would show a full battery charge (with brand new batteries installed), the next it would show the low battery icon, then turn itself off. I'd turn it back on and it would be back to showing a full battery. The video and picture quality were average at best. One of the people in our group was using a Canon Powershot SD1300 IS in a waterproof case and the photos and video from that camera made the Mini II's look like crap! Another person's review likened the image quality to that of a cheap cell phone camera; they're absolutely right. Another person in our group was also using a brand new Mini II and he shares my opinion. Both of us plan on returning our cameras for a refund.UPDATE: I was indeed able to return the Mini II for a refund and instead bought a Canon Powershot 300HS camera and Canon's underwater housing for it. Price-wise, the Canon and the housing cost me the same as the Mini II. Took the 300HS on a 7 day dive trip to Roatan and the quality of the photos and high definition video (unavailable on the Mini II) was outstanding, proving conclusively (in my case anyway) that the Sealife Mini II is a piece of junk.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Catastrophic leak on 2nd dive", "Author": "Paul D.

The other 5 times or so we've used it were for snorkeling trips.The camera seemed pretty decent at first; the picture quality wasn't fantastic, per say, but that could be equal parts water clarity and camera quality. But the reason for the negative review is primarily the longevity for this camera; for the price, I certainly would have expected it to last more than 6 times in the water. On our most recent snorkel trip, we noticed water had gotten under the display screen somehow. From the previous time of use to this now problematic one, we hadn't opened the camera or done anything with the memory card. We also hadn't dropped it or left it anywhere it should have been left - it was well taken care of. So, for reasons unknown to us, the seal seems to have broken, and the camera is no longer of any use to us.The way this camera is made is not durable - do not be tempted to purchase it due to it's 'lower' underwater camera price - it is simply not worth the money.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sea Life Mini 2 = Waste of money", "Author": "Christopher Vaught", "ReviewID": "R1FMBMUK9EIB1K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've returned this camera three times now.

I played with it a little in a swimming pool and on land.  Finally was able to book a diving trip to Kauai in June of 2012.  We left for the vacation on Father's Day of 2012.  (The camera has a 1 year warranty).  I knew of the short battery life and had plenty of AAA batteries with me and the batteries lasted through each dive with no problem. I also had a 4 gb SDHC memory card.  Our first dive worked ok.  On the second dive, I got a \"memory full\" message, then a card error message.  Well, I was surprised that I would have used up 4 gigs of memory, so I ran  out and purchased a 16 gb SDHC card.  Checked that the new card would work and got ready for our next dive.  The next day on our next dive, I took a few pictures and made a short video, when I got a full memory message again.  Since I had only a few pics, I decided to just reformat the card while I was still underwater (one of the nice features of the camera), so I lost those pictures.  Then the camera gave me a \"card error\" message.  So, no more pictures on that dive.  Checked the camera once we were out of the water, everything seemed to be working alright again.  Went down for our final dive and immediately got a card error message.  All in all, out of four dives, I got one short video clip and about 20 pictures.  I was really looking forward to getting a chance to use this camera on a dive (we are occasional divers, one trip every year or two) and we are extremely disappointed in this camera.I admit that it is an easy camera to use, but found that the pictures it did take (9 Megapixels) were really not a great quality and the video is so-so.  I have contacted the retailer that I purchased it from, and he has promised to try to help me, but I am afraid that I may be stuck with this less than perfect camera because I have had it for more than a year.  I will not take a chance with this camera on another dive (October cruise to Mexico).

It allowed me to capture some amazing pictures for my first and following snorkeling trips during my month-long+ trip in the islands of Thailand. The reviews on Amazon had me worried about possible leakage of the salt water into the camera but I shouldn't have been concerned. For over 8 snorkel and kayak day-trips, I only required 1 set of batteries. I bought the 8GB memory card for my trip and it never filled up and I took thousands of pictures. The included wrist strap was excellent for securely holding the camera to my wrist while I swam. There is a small delay in the shutter so with the quicker fish it was more of a challenge to capture them but I found after a while a method to take several pictures in a row while trying to hold the camera steady under the water usually produced at least one clear shot. Towards the end of my trip I did find that the lens of the camera looked cloudy and some pictures reflected this. The locking mechanism on the camera which covers the battery and memory card from the water is complicated at first to open however after a few tries it becomes second nature. Having the memory card USB reader is fantastic for quickly uploading shots to see the beautiful memories you captured. The fact that the camera has both a land and a water setting is really helpful. Though I did find that sometimes I would forget to change my setting from water to land when I would come up to the surface but my pictures still tended to turn out well. I had a hard time with the flash on the camera. I couldn't really figure out when I was supposed to use it - sometimes it worked but sometimes it would blur everything and even seemed to scare the fish away. I appreciated the battery-save mode with the camera - it would turn off after no pictures were taken for a while.Overall I would recommend this camera for underwater pictures and for being an almost indestructible camera for action adventures. I loved not worrying about when my camera fell out of my bag on the boat and when it hit the kayak by accident. The lighting does affect the pictures and especially whether you have a steady hand but once you master that the pictures you can take are endless.I cannot speak to how this camera compares to the more expensive SeaLife Reefmaster or Pro but for a basic intro underwater camera it more than served its purpose!Pictures can speak more than words so check out some of the great pictures that were taken with this SeaLife Mini II!I know I am really excited for my next water adventure and being able to document the experience!Suggestions for improvement: Add a lens cover that you could flip manually so when you want to store the camera the lens doesn't bump up against a finger or something. Something to clean the lens of the fog from water or salt deposits. I used my sunglass cloth and that helped a lot but I'm sure there could be something better. Would be nice if it could be a little less thick so that it could fit comfortably in a pants or short pocket easier. Perhaps also a viewfinder in addition to the screen - I found when I was taking pictures and it was really bright I would have difficulty seeing the screen to tell what I was taking a picture of and wouldn't be able to see the results until I had uploaded the pictures to my computer.I did not pay for this product but I do not believe that I let that color my review.

If you are looking for magazine quality photos, consider a much more expensive camera.  We wanted something that went further than the disposable film cameras (15 ft) as my husband was going to dive the Great Barrier Reef.  This product states it goes to 130 feet.  The digital feature was a bonus as he did not have to wait long to see the results.  After viewing the pictures, I noticed the exposure was not as good.  However, you have to consider that he was at depth and you lose color.  We found the video to be far more interesting though as you could hear sounds.  There is an underwater and land option on the camera to account for lighting conditions so you have to remember to switch it when taking pictures in either situation.  My husband took pictures while going canyoning in New Zealand and they looked good.The only issue my husband encountered was the battery life which I had read from user reviews.  I spoke with Sea Life today and they indicated that it was recommended that lithium instead of alkaline batteries be used.  It makes sense as the camera has to work harder to capture the image due to the low light conditions.  The technician I spoke with was extremely helpful and offered to send me lithium batteries to try out before sending it back in for repair.  For more inforamtion, check out their website about the product specification ([..]).Overall, we like the product.  If you consider the cost of a disposable cameras (the camera iteslf and processing), this camera will eventually cost us less in the long run. The quality of the pictures is on par with a point and shoot so it is good for capturing memories.  We also plan to use it for other water related activities (e.g. snorkeling, tubing, jet skiing, etc) and will probably use it for skiing (using the land option).
