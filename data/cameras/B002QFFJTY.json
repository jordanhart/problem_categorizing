The only thing I can help with is to say whether it is worth adding it to an amateur's camera bag. After having it for about a year I would say \"Yes!\". First, if you are like me and take a ton of pictures when site seeing, this is your lens. I wish I had it for my trip to China and Japan because my regular lenses just could not take in the enormity of many of the palaces. I have also used this lens countless times to take pictures of homes. It grabs the whole room and gives people a chance to see everyhing instead of piecing a bunch of pictures together. For a while, it became my primary lens as I found it worked so well, but I got over that and now just make sure that it is always handy.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002QFFJTY"}}
