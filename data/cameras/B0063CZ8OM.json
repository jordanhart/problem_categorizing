{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good 3d camera but too narrow base and no manual controls in 3d?", "Author": "George A. Themelis", "ReviewID": "RHV5YH6RB8OTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from Amazon. I am a 3d photographer, interested mainly in still 3d photography.  I have used the camera for a week.  Based on my experience so far, and comparing it with the Fuji and other 3d camera systems I have used, here are my first impressions:Panasonic (+):- Good image quality (for what it is)- Well-aligned images- Image stabilization results in sharper pictures- Wide angle 25mm focal length is a big plus- Short stereo base (distance of lenses) is good for close-ups- Good battery performance- Compact & relatively easy to usePanasonic (-):- No manual controls for exposure or ISO (in 3d)- No ability to turn the flash on (in 3d)- Limited settings and controls in 3d- Not as easy to use with one hand compared to the Fuji (you cannot slide the cover with one hand easily and you end up touching the back of the screen changing settings - you cannot turn the touch screen off)- The location of flash (almost between the lenses) is a problem (just like the Fuji, it leads to pseudoscopic shadows)- The Stereo base (30mm) is too narrow for general 3d- No 3d display- Very expensive (for what it is) - [This was written when the camera sold for $500, which is what I paid]The Panasonic is very limited in what it can do in 3d. It is mainly good for snapshots in tight situations and close-ups (which, I have to admit, is a favorite shooting situation for me.)  It will produce relatively sharp and well-exposed pictures even in low light and without flash (with care).  It will let you shoot a self-portrait at arm's length (try that with the Fuji!)  It will get some interesting 3d pictures (like close-ups of people and pets) that no other 3d camera I know of can.But it falls short for general 3d photography due to the narrow stereo base (the pictures without close objects look flat.)  Not being able to turn the flash on and control exposure manually severely limits the use of the camera with an external flash so you are stuck with the unpleasant shadows of the camera's internal flash.Panasonic had the chance to make a much more useful 3d camera but failed, in my opinion.  The lack of 3d exposure & flash control (and flash placement) is downright criminal :) The thinking behind this is a mystery for me.  You trust people to use the many 2d features but disallow them in 3d.  Why?As things stand right now, I cannot recommend this camera at this price ($500) for the average stereo enthusiast, for general 3d photography. I give it 3 stars.  That is 5 stars for being a 3d camera, minus one star for the lack of manual controls in 3d and minus another star for the way too narrow stereo base.  [Note: A couple of months later, this camera has become my most often used stereo camera. I get to appreciate the good image quality.  What I wrote here is still true, but I am moving the rating up one point for the surprisingly good image quality, so 4 stars.]If the Fuji had some of the Panasonic features (better image quality, wider focal length, narrower stereo base, say 60mm) it would have been a terrific 3d camera.  As things stand right now, neither camera is perfect. That's why I need both. :)", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well Worth the Wait!", "Author": "Erol Esen", "ReviewID": "R1Q2KG8HLGM5JP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to work at Kodak, and 10 years ago I had written a proposal for Kodak to create a 3D camera. Just put another lens-CCD into the camera and a great versatile 3D camera it would be. Some people liked it, I guess, and they gave me a \"space pen\"; one you can write at any direction. And nothing came of the proposal.Until now...Panasonic Lumix DMC-3D1 is really what I had hoped to use 10 years ago. They did it. And they did it well. It's very quick to take the images, as opposed to Sony's sweep 3D technique. When I look at the pictures on my 3D monitor and NVIDIA 3D glasses, each image gives me a pause to appreciate the detail and depth. It 'refreshes' the brain's memory in 3D; memories become more vivid. This is indeed a better experience than looking at 2D.Double the lens and MOS (another variation of CCD and ~12MP per image) means double the memory requirements, so do get at least a good sized memory card, like Transcend 32 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC6.The camera generates MPO files. MPO stands for Multi Picture Object File. So, when you take a 3D image, it puts two jpeg images inside this kind of file. The two images are about 5 to 10 degrees apart, similar to how human eyes are for seeing the world in 3D. It maybe slight annoyance that you'll have to be at least 3 feet away from a focused object, and you can use flashlight in 3D mode and many other feature *depending* on the scene (SCN) option you select and/or flash mode in REC menu options when you click on 'menu' on the display screen. You can even change the depth option, which ranges between -2 and +2, with 0 being 'normal'. What does this mean? When you press on the top button half-way, you may get 'No 3D' icon, which means the camera hasn't been able to focus on something that would yield good 3D. If this happens, either move the camera to make it happy to take a 3D image (no No-3D icon); or, lower the 3D requirement (remember, lesser the easier but less 3D-ish.)Although there maybe some shortcomings in the 3D mode, it's good enough to forgive them at this point in time, when there really isn't a better alternative for point-and-shoot 3D.I'm happy with how long the battery lasts; about 16 GB's worth before it needs to be re-charged. Get another battery so that one would be charging when the other is used. I recommend: Lumix POWER KIT DMW-BCG10 (Includes 2-1200mAh batteries and pocket charger) for the Panasonic DMC-ZS1, DMC-TZ7S, DMC-TZ7T, DMC-ZS1K, DMC-ZS1S, DMC-ZS3, DMC-ZS8, DMC-ZS9, DMC-ZS10, DMC-ZS5, DMC-ZS6, DMC-ZS7 DMW BCG10E, DMW BCG10P. Also included is our High.The user interface of this camera is outstanding: it's simple. It has three buttons: to take a picture, video, and on/off, which is not needed since there is also a slide cover for the optics. When you open the slide the camera turns on. There is also a solitary switch on the back to designate 3D or 2D image taking mode. There is not much to be said for zooming; there is some digital zooming, which can be useful for recording 3D video. USB interface, and a large touchscreen in the back.I'm kind of disappointed with the software. The software that comes with this camera is nothing to be thrilled about. The software you'll need is the best video editing software in the world: CyberLink PowerDirector 10 Ultra. It's affordable and it works wonders, especially with MPO files, video or snapshots.Now, to really appreciate the 3D images, I recommend you get a 3D monitor and NVIDIA 3D Vision: Acer GD235HZbid Widescreen 23.6\" 3D LCD Display and nvidia 942-10701-0003-004 3D Vision Wireless Glasses Kit, respectively. I know it's getting a little expensive. I didn't buy all at once. When I needed to get a new computer, I just made sure to get one with 3D support. The NVIDIA glasses really to work. This is not red-cyan glasses, but electronic glasses that synch with the monitor to get great 3D sensation.There is one more thing I need to mention. When taking an image vertically, rotation of a 3D image is not straightforward. There is a free software out there written by a Japanese programmer Masuji Suto, and the program's name is \"Stereo Photo Maker\". It's a robust piece of software and did wonders for me to split the jpeg images inside an MPO file, resize (automatically adjusts dimensions to keep the aspect ratio--important; otherwise your image will stretch in a weird way), rotate, and merge them back into a new MPO file.There is concern about other people not enjoying the 3D experience with glasses. But technology will come to display in 3D without glasses. When that happens, my 3D images will be easy to view in the new medium, whatever this may turn out to be. It took a while before the general population could cheaply 'see' the pictures taken in photography. This is where George Eastman came into play: he invented affordable and easy viewing of pictures taken. Maybe a new Eastman will come along and get rid of the glasses to make 3D easy and affordable for everyone.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb all around camera for 2D/ 3D photography and video recording", "Author": "kumquatsrus", "ReviewID": "R7DH0VK5S89N1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon user since 2003 but my very first review posted.  This is my third camera after coming from two older Canon and Fujifilm point and shoot cameras.  I ordered through Vanns.  I purchased this camera primarily for 2D functionality with 3D as a secondary option to utilize for certain applications/ situations.  I have had the camera for about a week or so now.Pros:-Excellent/ sharp image quality and image stabilization works great-User friendly touch screen-Wide array of settings and controls-Ability to take two shots at the same time with varying zoom levels-Ability to record video and take pictures at the same time-Ability to record video in 3d or take pictures in 3d-Quick shutter speed/ response time-Low light performance is above average for a compact-Great mics and sound quality (wind cut is a nice touch)-Fairly good battery life considering the camera's feature set (comparable to other compacts in it's class), though I would still recommend a spareCons:-Included Manual has very limited instructions/ doesn't explain all the features and options of the camera (a more advanced manual can be found at the following link:[...]-No built-in autostereoscopic 3d display for 3d playback (though I would imagine the appeal would still be somewhat limited in comparison to a large 3d monitor)-Narrow stereo base limits the use of 3d for certain shooting applications-In playback, display icons take about three seconds to disappear from view (even moving from picture to picture), with no option to turn off all completely-Only up to 1080i instead of 1080p for HD video-Touchscreen shutter control seems a bit too sensitive/ finicky to be particularly useful-Didn't come free? (lol)Overall, a very innovative compact camera that is useful for almost any situation that may arise, especially given its pocketability.  The pros definitely far outweigh the cons.  It won't replace a DSLR, but that's not it's intended purpose nor target audience.  It's not the perfect camera (does such a thing exist?), but it does its job very well.  That seems even more amazing after considering its size and weight.  If I had to do it all over, then I would definitely purchase this camera again.  Compared to its nearest competition, this camera is the more solid buy, imho (given both of their flaws).  The cons didn't bother me very much enough to deduct from the overall score and seem fairly minor to me, but it may be enough to concern other potential buyers (save perhaps the last con =P).  Furthermore, for users that may use it strictly as a 3d camera - I could see how its design could affect overall functionality for their intended use in every shooting situation(though I imagine the design choices were intentional on the part of the manufacturer, since I doubt one could design the camera in a way to please everyone and their particular needs).In response to the other review:I think the camera isn't particularly expensive considering all that it does.  Considering the W3 only came out about a year or so prior to this one and retailed at about the same price, I would say it is fairly priced (though obviously I wouldn't mind if it was cheaper).  In regards to the 3d functionality - yes it is more limited than in 2d mode; but as far as I can tell, flash control and exposure levels can be adjusted - just tap on the menu icon and then the record icon and it will bring up the options (for auto flash, slow sync, and flash off)/ (exposure).  You can even add shortcuts for these two options (or any other available ones for that matter) via the menu icon -> record icon -> M icon on the bottom right, if you so choose.  Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but I believe this is correct.P.S. Happy Leap Year Day!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than the Fujifilm w3, but doesn't do distant shots as well.", "Author": "Contrabardus \"It's only funny until someone g...", "ReviewID": "R2WAXALC9AKQAP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this and a Fujifilm W3. Both were bought inexpensively by me, I paid less than $200 for both. In fact, I think there was maybe a $5 difference, $168 for this, and $163 for the W3.Put these two cameras together and you've pretty much got a near perfect 3D camera. For me, the two together were still cheaper than buying a single camera that could do what the two of these together can do. The Fujifilm takes great distant shots because there is more distance between the lenses. This is great for close up 3D shots.Neither is particularly wonderful as far as resolution goes. The Fujifilm is 10mp, which results in 5mp 3D shots, that's still full HD. 1920x1080 is 2073600 pixels, or 2.0736mp. That isn't great if you're looking to crop or make prints, but if you are using an HD screen as the primary viewing device or using the images for posting online, it's more than enough to get the best quality images you're going to get anyway.Both the Lumix and the W3 have digital zoom. Digital zoom is kind of useless for 3d as resolution goes down when using it and that has a big impact on image quality in 3D. It does lower image quality in 2D as well, but it's more useful as the impact on image quality isn't quite as much. Both also have optical zoom. The W3 is x3 max, but the Lumix is x4.This is 12mp, or 6mp for 3D. Most 3D displays are 1080p anyway, so you're good there too. Unless you're making prints, zooming in, or doing a lot of cropping, you won't notice a difference.The W3's video is complete crap. You can only shoot about a 15 second clip, and it only takes video at 720, which means that a 3D video is horribly grainy. It's essentially useless as a video recording device on any level.This on the other hand shoots at 1080i, not super great, but great quality for the price. It also takes videos as long as 30 minutes at a time. The close parallax of the lenses means it's more useful as a video camera as most video subjects are fairly close up when someone is taking a video with this type of camera. It's a far superior 3D video camera.The Lumix is also a much better camera for night or low light shooting. The W3 has all sorts of artifacts and low light video is muddy and grainy. This makes for much cleaner looking night or low light shots.The Lumix boots up faster. The W3 takes a bit to boot up, but the Lumix is much better for taking fast pics. Spur of the moment images are captured better with the Lumix, as it also has less delay between shots. Much better at catching a moving subject.I tend to take both with me when I go out. Neither is particularly large, though the Lumix is smaller. The W3 takes longer to boot up, but it's more suited to distant still images.Both cameras are a great deal, and both are great for taking 3D images in different ways.The Lumix is the better all around camera though. It's the one I'd recommend to someone else to be perfectly honest. It's much more versatile, takes better video by far, and aside from distant shots does just about everything better than the W3 does.Mine is Japanese only BTW. It's not too bad as there is an English manual available for download and the icons are fairly self explanatory. I've yet to have any difficulty operating the camera, and a little experimentation cleared up any function I wasn't sure about. It's easy to experiment with a digital camera as there is no such thing as wasting film. Anyway, all the operations are in Japanese, but it doesn't matter much. The English manual is easy to find, Google it and you'll have no trouble finding it.I wouldn't give up my W3 personally, it's great for scenery shots or distant subjects, but the Lumix is my go to standby for anything else. It's well worth the money and you really can't get a better 3D camera for the price right now.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good 3D camera but...", "Author": "Mindblade", "ReviewID": "R1ETGNPFXOHJQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "...not the perfect one. Here's why:Pro:+ Can be used quickly - delay after turning it on is minimal+ 4x optical zoom+ good battery life+ Full HD Video (in 2D mode, 3D uses SBS, so only half the resolution)+ Good weight+ 12 Megapixels (2D pictures)Con:- 3D effect is okay but not great (probably because the two lenses are relatively close together)- 3D video uses side-by-side mode, so 960x1080 resolution- 3D pictures are only 6 Megapixels- Image quality is mediocre (really visible noise when zooming in at 1:1 pixels)- you cannot \"play\" (i.e., look at pictures or videos) without opening the lenses- Touchscreen controls are a bit clumsy. It takes some time to navigate (but at least you can define two shortcut buttons to the main screen)Overall, I was a little disappointed by this product.

The Fuji camera couldn't take good photos indoors. According to the reviews, the Panasonic 3D1 camera performs well indoors. Unfortunately, in reality this is not case. The quality of the photos taken indoors is as bad as the Fuji camera. I also compared the Panasonic 3D1 with my 6 years old Casio Exilim by taking photos in the same indoor conditions. The Panasonic is far superior compared with the Casio in terms of resolution and other specifications. Comparing the qualities of the photos it is the opposite to what the specifications say. The Panasonic photos look like very low resolution photos with unrealistic colors (both cameras used the inbuilt flash). I wish I could say something good about the Panasonic 3D1 but it is just a very ordinary camera with photo quality comparable to the ones found in cheap phones. Apart from the poor photo quality, the recorded audio (video recording) has a very noticeable white noise (like an old TV when the signal drops). The battery run time is around four times shorter compared to the old Casio. Also, the battery must be charged outside the camera - no usb charging is possible. The industrial design of the camera is pretty ordinary and looks cheap. The touch screen is resistive type, not capacitive like most new smart phones. If someone is attracted by the 3D HD video capability of this camera, don't waste your money. I have Sony HDR-TD10E and the 3D-HD video and audio quality is close to professional.
