{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A superb camera, but one needs to learn it", "Author": "Joe Pennant", "ReviewID": "R2VHNTWKVRR08T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A powerful and capable camera in its own right, that can take stunningly good images let down only by glaring usability issues. The overall performance envelope is head and shoulders above any prosumer class camera on the market. The only cameras that can best the s9000 in performance, handling, build and image quality are current dSLR's. And even then, not by much.You would have to spend real money in dSLR-land for the body and lenses (plural) to match or beat what this camera is capable of.Unfortunately, you may not get that impression upon first use out of the box. The unintuitive menu system alone made me want to bash the camera against a hard rock. The AF system seemed to hunt all over the place. The pictures didnt seem as sharp as its predecessors. Low light performance seemed abysmal. The write speed is often slow.This isnt a point and shoot camera for the new photographer. It is a hugely capable camera for the serious photographer. The learning curve is steep. Very steep. Reading the manual and taking the time to learn the features and capabilities is mandatory, not optional.But once you do learn the camera, it is a delight in operation and image quality. It is super quick. You can have it powered up, up to your eye, focused and ready to take the picture in less than 2 seconds. The focusing system, used properly, is sure and fast. The images capture a wide range of subtle details. The colors are natural and are nicely punched up in Chrome mode. ISO from 80-1600 is available in all modes. You can take pictures in near darkness (ISO AND EV compensation is your friend). The handling is sweet. The camera feels like professional kit.(Edit after 6 months  of ownership for new s9000 owners)Per my experiences :A) Read the manual, Read the manual, read the manual. The camera is capable of quite a bit, so there is a lot to learn about what it is capable of. The  initial learning curve is steep.B) Take time to learn the menu, where all  the settings are,  because thats  where you have to change things like the ISO, color mode and whatnot. Biggest pain in the butt of the camera.C)  For speed, shoot  in JPEG mode - it slows down hard when shooting in  RAW. When shooting in JPEG,you can either shoot 5mp or 9mp for speed and space. The 9mp files are big, so it can slow you down shooting, while the quality of the 5mp files is REALLY  good, so unless youre shooting for full quality, you can pretty much shoot in 5mp mode.(The 5mp images  from the s9000 are better than most 5mp images.)D) ISO characteriistics- The s9000 gives  great quality and low noise up ISO 800,  where noise will start to show,  1600 is only for truly horrible lighting conditions.. If you want no noise and quality, shoot to up  400.- The camera is very flexible and will handle most lighting  conditions with ease.  Until you get fading light, then the autofocus and exposure gets slow and indecisive. Recognise that point and go up on ISO, even if you think you have enough light.Again, you  have to go into  the menu to change ISO, so you want to learn where it is to change quickly.E) Image quality.The image  quality may seem  not so sharp on standard settings.  It is VERY sharp, but on  default  settings,  there is no sharpening applied to the image, unlike most point and shoot cameras which applies a lot of sharpening, so it will seem the image is soft when it's actually quite sharp.If you think you need to sharpen the images, you can change the sharpening settings in camera or just shoot on default settings (recommended) and sharpen in  post processing.F) The Lens- Zoom is addictive, and the zoom range on this camera is very addictive. :)Recognise that 200mm  is the magic point. Over 200, small movements are amplified, low light shooting is harder and the image quality gets a bit soft. Best to shoot wide at night.- The zoom is manual, so this makes it a two-handed camera, if youre used to motorized zoom.  The manual makes the zoom very very fast.-  Remember to lock the lens hood when using it. Otherwise, its easy  to accidentally knock off and lose.G) Essential accessories- A UV filter to protect the lens and cut down on UV light. Get one. Do not mess around.- Bigger memory cards. xD cards are more expensive than CF cards.- Monopod (with stand up legs) and Tripod, with a ball  head.- Cable release (the  shutter is threaded for this reason).H) OtherThe camera is very very capable. If the pics arent coming out the way you want, its not  the camera, its you.  Just work with it.This camera will  make you  a better photographer.Like all Fuji cameras Ive ever used, once you take the time to really learn it, hidden capabilities seem to appear out of nowhere, making you glad that you chose a Fuji.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Absolutely THE BEST prosumer camera on the market!", "Author": "Alex Vox", "ReviewID": "RG82EB63JN3QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hey,l if you on a market for digital camera and some $575 does not scare you off get this camera! Don't listen to these tailored by other brands review because FUJi has here absolutely the best product you can dream of. I have a quite experience with digital cameras of any kind, I own two DSLR and they are in a bad shape comparing to this baby.First it takes AMAZINGLY nice photos, with nice contrast, full of detail, excellent color reproduction and ALWAYS PERFECT light balance. The photographic quality of this camera is better than any so called \"entry level\" DSLR and they hate it!!! Hat down to FUJI for this camera it is a real photographic tool, with lens  that is so good that I can't express it enough. If you will decide to go with DSLR you will have to spent AT LEAST $2000 to be on a par with this lens. Forget this stupid chi-chat of \"the sensor size is smaller..., blah, blah, blah\" who cares of the size if the photos are miles ahead and the convenience is untouchable by any DSLR? Ah?Second all those who pour on this camera didn't find anything better to complain about that is \"poor noisy ISO-1600\". Who shot on ISO 1600 unless you are a spy ? I make some 22000 (twenty two thousands, not a typo) photos during a year 2005, I found 16 (sixteen, not a typo again) made on ISO 1600. It is pretty much useless ISO that virtually NO ONE uses. It is the same thing as to complain that your car has a poor acceleration on the altitudes above 8000 feet. May be it really does but who cares?!Second this camera has SUPERIOR VIDEO mode. You can capture full blown videos, movies and make it as a top quality camcorder does and it is extremely nice!!! I don't take my camcorder anymore, I bring back some 15-20 minute of nice footage , because no one bother to watch longer than that anyway.Third, the RAW mode. First of all the RAW isn't \"hidden in the menus\" but it is readily available with super usable, under finger \"F\" menu. Second no one who is not completely retarded takes RAW shots to convert them to JPEG. If you do it, take the basic photography class, read some books and do not embarrass yourself by publishing this pulp to everyone's eyes. You take in RAW something that is really worthy the effort, some super duper sunset for example and so on. And the included software converts it to TIFF because FUJI assumes that the camera users aren't morons!Take this camera and learn to use it and enjoy photography. I use Fuji equipment for over two decades from their studio MF cameras to MF GA645-SZ and they never been anything less than THE BEST.I can understand the fury of manufacturers of low end DSLRs but it is not a way to deal with a competition by pouring on the superior product. You should strive more and make better cameras. Fuji has its own superior sensor, they make their own superior glass, they have their own superior designers, they make unique , wonderful cameras. They have a luxury not to drag in a tail of someone else's  sensor design they do on their own.Every camera that I get from Fuji rejuvenates my interest to photography again and again. Thank you guys at FUJI.", "Date": "December 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix S9000 Review with update at the end", "Author": "James B. Hewin \"jameshewin.com\"", "ReviewID": "R12QEK6TMBYWWP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this camera when I bought it. My goal was to find the best fixed lens digital camera (often referred to as DigiCams) on the market that fit my particular needs. I wanted a DigiCam  instead of a digital SLR because I hate changing lenses often and I didn't want to deal with dust on the sensor.My needs:1. At least 8 megapixels2. Fast shutter response (very little lag between the time you push the button and when the shutter fires.3. Good wide to telephoto optical zoom.4. Good auto focus5. High ISO6. Low noise7. Good color response and sharpnessI used the camera for about 2 weeks. It is 9 mega pixels so good resolution. The shutter lag was excellent... almost nonexistent. It responded like an SLR in that respect.The telephoto on the FinePix S9000 is a 10.7x optical zoom (28-300mm), very good. The only thing I wish the FinePix S9000 had is image stabilization. I believe there is only one 8 MP DigiCam on the market with a longer optical zoom, the Samsung Digimax Pro815. I decided against the Samsung because even though it has a longer telephoto, reviews said it had long shutter lag, focusing can feel slow, and hunts - and often fails - at long end of zoom, especially in low light, and no high ISO capability (400 was top).The auto focus on the FinePix S9000 is excellent. And, it has an AF illuminator which focuses very quickly in low light.The FinePix S9000 has a high ISO of 1600. However, noise starts to be a problem at any ISO higher than 400. That was a bit of a disappointment.The color response and sharpness was a bit of a disappointment at first. Using it in \"Standard\" mode, the photos were a bit dull looking. However, it has a \"Chrome\" mode which supposedly mimics slide film like Kodachrome or Ektachrome. In that mode, essentially the color saturation and sharpness are turned up. I got good sharpness and color in Chrome mode, although noise was increased ever so slightly. I eventually started just using the camera with the setting always on Chrome.I tested the FinePix S9000 both outdoors with landscape type stuff and some shots of birds at a distance to test the telephoto. And I tested it indoors shooting models in a studio setting with mono lights and umbrellas. I was over all happy with the outdoor results, although I still hunger for an even longer telephoto and image stabilization. In the studio I was very happy with the results. In Chrome mode, good color and sharpness and very good skin tones.My other DigiCam is the Canon Powershot Pro 1, a very good little camera. Comparing the 2 cameras:1. The Canon has a shorter telephoto.2. Shutter lag and auto focus on the Canon are very slow. A disappointment if you like to fire fast and catch what you see, like with sports or anything where the subject is moving fast. The Fuji was excellent.3. The Canon only goes up to ISO 400 and gets noisy at 400.  The Fuji goes to 1600. Noise on the Fuji starts to be a problem around 400 to 800, but still if you want very low light capability the Fuji beats the Canon. And the Fuji has the AF illuminator which makes focusing in low light a dream.4. The Canon has excellent color and sharpness right out of the box. The Fuji needs a little help, either with Chrome mode or PhotoShop after the fact.5. The Canon popup flash is excellent and powerful. The Fuji popup flash is dismal. Not very powerful and color quality on flash photos iffy at best.6. In the studio you can't use an external flash with the Canon. None of my external flashes or infra red slave triggers worked with the hot shoe on the Canon. You have to buy Canon brand TTL external flashes for the hot shoe to work. And, there is no PC connector on the Canon. The only way to fire external flashes with the canon is to use the popup flash in Manual mode to fire slave flashes. With the Fuji, I can use my infra red slave trigger in the hotshoe and fire slave flashes that way. And, there is a PC connector on the Fuji if needed.7. The Canon has a large pull out rotatable LCD on the back, which is great for shooting holding the camera at any angle. The Fuji has a smaller LCD and although it folds out from the back slightly, you can't twist it for odd angles. It is especially a problem if you like to hold the camera low and shoot vertically. You just can't see the LCD on the Fuji if the camera is low and vertical.Overall I was satisfied with the Fuji FinePix S9000. But here is the kicker. I picked up the camera yesterday and turned it on and... Houston We Have A Problem... it was dead. Nothing in the viewfinder or on photos I took but purple hazy fuzz. Apparently the sensor has malfunctioned. I am not sure if I got a Lemon or if it is just a fluke. But it doesn't say much for the Fuji folks if a camera freaks and dies 2 weeks out of the box. So my review on this camera is this: at first, great camera but not perfect. Someday I hope to own a DigiCam with an even longer telephoto, image stabilization and low noise at higher ISOs. But for now, for my needs, this is probably the best camera on the market. I was just getting happy that I bought the Fuji when it died.So... As DigiCams go, buyer beware. A lot of very good features, but may have a problem. I would give it a 4 Star rating but I am only giving it 3 since it died on me. I'm just glad I didn't sell my Canon Powershot Pro 1. For now, I like the Fujifilm FinePix S9000 enough to get the place I purchased it from (Adorama through Amazon) to replace the defective FinePix S9000 with another one and try again. So we shall see.Update: Since I wrote this review a while back I thought it was time to update it.I bought the original camera from Adorama through Amazon. I contacted Adorama via phone and they graciously and quickly took care of the problem by sending me another FinePix 9000 within a couple of weeks. Good service from Adorama.The new one they sent me has one small problem. There is a small spot on the sensor (part of a assembly line fingerprint perhaps?) It doesn't show on most normal photos, but when I take shots with a neutral gray background, or blue or some other mid range color, which I often do in the studio for portraits, it shows in every shot. Fortunately it is a very quick fix in Photoshop.The bottom line is this: I love this camera. Because the camera in every other respect is so good, I have accepted this small shortcoming as something I can live with.The real advantages I have found with this camera is the quality of the lens and auto focus, and the extremely fast shutter (no lag when you press the button). I can happily fire away as fast as I want and capture the exact moment I wanted (in JPG mode... If you shoot in RAW mode it's slower and you often have to wait a bit to fire your next shot). No lag is very important to me.Although every once and a while the auto focus goofs, for the most part is extremely fast and accurate, superior to most Prosumer cameras I have tried, especially in low light due to the auto focus sensor.I suspect the makers of this camera decided they wanted to mix superior features with inexpensive parts to keep the price down. For what I need, it works great, but the camera does seem cheaply made in some respects. A lot of the body is plastic for example. It wouldn't surprise me if some of the internal parts are cheaply made as well. But, the fact that the camera takes great photos overshadows that for me.My next camera will probably be a digital SLR, but for now, the camera is just what I needed. I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a more sophisticated camera than just a \"point and shoot\". For now it is probably in the top 2 Prosumer cameras. The only one that might be better is the Sony Cybershot DSCR1, which I have yet to try but is getting good reviews. My rating for this camera should now be 4 stars instead of 3.", "Date": "March 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "You \"Professionals\" that rate the S9000 less than average are out of your minds", "Author": "Devon Cloud \"Devon\"", "ReviewID": "R1KDWNOHXQ1BO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for three months now.  When I purchased the camera, I almost did not due to (a) lack of knowledge of photography along with (b)the fact that some of the so called \"professionals\" were giving this camera a less than average rating.  I figured that due to the number of bad reviews by the \"professionals\" that there had to be something wrong with the camera.As I did more and more homework, I noticed that everyone that bought the camera for the most part loved it.  Those that did not, I noticed turned around a few weeks later and stated that the S9000 was actually the best camera they had ever owned and that the problems they were having were user related.So, with this in mind, I went ahead and purchased the camera.  I wanted a camera that would give me excellent quality pictures but not have the cost of an SLR (professional) camera, and this camera fit the bill.This camera is awesome!  it takes pictures that are good enough quality to blow them up and frame, be in magazines, and I cannot tell a bit of difference between the pictures I take with this camera compared to the pictures my Uncle takes with his SLR.  It has features that no other prosumer camera has, it's zoom capabilities are awesome for a prosumer, 9 megapixels, macro and super-macro, and manual focus capabilities... you name it, they tried to fit it into this package... and did.While I am just a beginner, I have done my homework enough over the last few months to finally understand why this handfull of \"professionals\" gave this camera a bad rating.  They are comparing this camera to their professional SLR setups that probably have cost them thousands upon thousands of dollars instead of comparing this camera to the class of camera that it belongs in, the \"Prosumer\" class of cameras.Why is this?  I don't know for sure, but I bet it is because they picked up this camera and it has an SLR feel, can do about 90% of everything their SLR setup can do, and for a prosumer camera it has a ton of functions that until this camera came out, only SLR's had the capability of.What does this mean?  The S900 is a \"Prosumer\" camera that is  actually closer to an SLR than a prosumer camera!I will put it to you this way: anyone that knows a little about cameras that have looked at comparisons and reviews know one major rule:  you have comparisons between one prosumer camera and another, or you have a comparison between one SLR compared to another.  The S9000, a \"Prosumer\" camera, is being compared to the SLR's!!!!Now, for those of us who are thinking rationally about a camera that is worth spending our hard-earned money on, this is huge if you ask me.  I can buy a camera in the prosumer costrange (all be it the high-end of that range) of cost that will do most everything an SLR can do!  There are of course some limitations such as not being able to change out lenses, but the lense that is on there has such a huge range of capabilities that changing the lense is not necessary for over 90% of the pictures cameras can take!But, to the \"professionals\", the fact that there is some \"noise\" in the 1600 iso setting range on this camera makes it an inferior product???!!!!  Come on here guys... name some other prosumer cameras that even have this range!  There are none that I know of, and if there are some out there, let's see some comparisons!The fact that you \"professionals\" try to place this \"bridge camera\" in the same class as your professional equipment speaks an incredible amount of superiority of this camera compared to anything in the class of cameras the S9000 truly belongs in (in my opinion of course).  Why?  because the professionals won't even attempt to compare another prosumer camera with the SLR's. Not only is the S9000 of good enough quality to be compared to the SLR's, it actually held it's own in a number of those comparisons and was even considered a worthy advesary in some of them.So, let's stop bashing this camera you professionals.  I know it stings when you pick this camera up and for $600.00 can do 90% of what your $10,000 setup can do, but let's give credit where credit is due.", "Date": "March 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very good and sturdy camera", "Author": "TTV \"TTV\"", "ReviewID": "R3VN7OZKQA12HI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm quite amazed about how some users rate this camera. The S9000 (or S9500 for Europe/Asia) is not a DSLR. So comparing the S9000 to a DSLR is, at least, misleading; it's like comparing apples to oranges. The S9000 is a high-end fixed lens camera for around $600. If one would even buy an entry-level DSLR and wants the same lens performance, one has to buy 3 separate lenses: a wide-angle, normal and zoomlens. You end up paying $2000+I have used this camera for over a month and dropped it twice on rocks while trekking in mountains and it still works fine. I remembered several occasions whereby my friend, who has a DSLR, had to change lenses for different scenes and missed out some photo opportunities, while I used my all-in-one S9000 and could zoom in and zoom out at my heart's content.Yes, it may not deliver images as good as DSLR cameras, but then again, it is NOT a DSLR. It's like comparing a high-end bicycle to a basic motorbike and conclude that the motorbike is still faster!But for its class, i.e. fixed lens camera, it is an excellent choice. The image quality and extensive features are (very) good enough for its class and price. Noise levels are relatively low for a non-DSLR camera, even at ISO400. At ISO1600 the noise level is comparable to ISO400 for most cameras in its class. You can't expect a zero noise image at ISO 1600 for $600!I also like the dual card slots, which basically double the capacity of a photo session without changing memory cards.Some users on other websites complain that at 1cm-macro, you can't use the zoom. First, 1cm macro is very close. Second, this is a camera not a microscope.Of course, this camera is not \"perfect\" (no camera is), so these are the cons:- no image stabilizer. Quite handy if it comes with 10.7x zoom- quite high sound level at normal use- to view images you need to switch mode- at shutter speed priority mode, the ranges are quite limited (after 1/1000 secs it jumps quite fast to 1/4000 in very few steps). More refined steps would be better- not so impressive continuos shooting modes- small screen- the 'F mode' button is underutilised. Fuji should have included more functions under this button (instead of hidden under the menu button), such as white balance control, RAW, AF mode, sharpness- slow writing speed, especially in continuous shooting modeWhat I like about the camera, the pros:- lens performance (wide angle at 28mm and zoom 10.7x)- dual card slots- relatively low noise levels- sharp images- good colours- good movie quality- fast start-up and focussing- 'natural light' function- zoom ring instead of buttons- value for money for the price and its class- extensive features/functions- flip screen (but it's quite small)- relatively good EVF- good layout of buttons, grip and design- great flexibility in terms of manual controls- good flash (and hardly any red eye cases, even without using that flash mode)- 'information' button provide valuable data during shooting and in viewing modeOverall, I'm happy with this camera and I would certainly recommend it, certainly from price-quality perspective.", "Date": "November 9, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fuji FinePix S9000", "Author": "Rock Bottom", "ReviewID": "R3HZ9KEWACI7WE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very pleased with the Fuji FinePix S9000 camera. Wonderful pictures and very true color. I have emailed several photographs that I have taken to my brother (who is the real photographer in the family) and he was very, very impressed to say the least. The camera is very simple to use on automatic, however, there is a learning curve to understanding all the advanced features that this camera offers if you are not already educated on such matters. Choose to learn these features or not, out of the box (on automatic) you can get incredible shots right away even on Macro and Super Macro settings. The camera has a very nice feel to it, is easy to hold, and looks very much like an SLR. If you are looking for a camera with (close to) Digital SLR performance without spending $2,000+, this is the camera for you. I won't bore you with too many camera specifics, go read the experts reviews. I did notice several other reviewers here on AMAZON and their low scores on this camera. I really wonder if they are reviewing the same camera??? Every expert opinion I have read has been minimum 4.5 and most rate it 5 stars for its incredible performance. I read the FinePix S9000 also just won the prestigious Gold DIWA Award. The camera has its limitations too, which all the experts will tell you, such as noise in the upper ISO's. If you are like me, taking pictures indoors and outdoors in the daylight or with the flash, this camera can not be beat. The Macro (close-up) pictures I've done have been wonderful too.

Which means someone has got their hands on a good camera, although not without its faults.  I've been an 'advanced amateur' photographer for about 30 years and carried a heavy bag full of my beloved Minolta  lenses and camera bodies for 25 of them.  Then I went digital, first a Nikon Coolpix (great exposure algorithms, not much zoom range) then a Minolta Dimage 7 (totally disappointing) then a Fuji Finepix 602Z (amazing).  I carried it around the world for four years and it's never let me down: totally dependable, sharp pix and great exposures. But when the Finepix 9500 became available in Europe with its 9MP, extrapolated to 12MP, sensor I thought I'd have to try it.  And the 10:1 zoom seemed like a winner too.  So I bought one about five months ago and have mixed feelings.  I've been reading reviews on this site and  sympathise with those who've been frustrated with the 9000's apparent lack of sharpness and slow focus, because I felt the same way.  Also mine would freeze occasionally after taking a shot (always irreplaceable of course) and I'd lose the frame when I had to reboot the camera.  Neverthless I've decided to buy another one.  I've been looking back over my photos to check on sharpness and realise that the lens and sensor are very sharp indeed under the right conditions.  Unfortunately, that means bright light if you're shooting on the long end of the zoom and a tripod if it's overcast.  It's a long lens but slow, so the combination of lens shake and ISO noise starts affecting sharpness as the camera searches for the right exposure. (I know how to manually expose, but find that the camera does a better job than me unless I've got plenty of time and a tripod).  The great thing about the Finepix is that it's a relatively inexpensive camera with features that belong on much more expensive cameras.  The problem with the digital SLR's and replaceable lenses, is that I'm back where I was five years ago - lugging a bag of heavy stuff around with me.  With the 9500 I can shoot with the equivalent of a 28mm-300mm zoom (enough for almost any situation) and if I remember its limitations I'll end up with shots that can be enlarged to 16\" x 20\" and look great.  I've looked at Nikon, Panasonic, Canon, Olympus and Pentax but have decided to go back with the Finepix I know - and if it lets me down I've always got the 602Z to fall back on.", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Everything I was looking for and more", "Author": "W. Ivey", "ReviewID": "R3HRP50EQ67RI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on several online reviews, including Steve's Digicams, and couldn't be more pleased. I've been using it since last Christmas (bought it as a present to myself after six months of looking at various brands and models). Aside from image quality (which it has plenty of) I insisted on at least an LCD viewfinder (EVF) as well as screen, a real filter ring (no adapters, please!) easy basic controls, long optical zoom, CF card, hot shoe and the ability to use ordinary AA batteries in a pinch. Also had to fit my hand and feel natural.This had all that, plus an actual cable release socket in the shutter button! (Thus I can easily use my cable and bulb releases, as well as a long-duration timer I have in my 35mm kit.) It also has a standard pc socket for more flash options than the built in flash or hot shoe.The heft is good, but not very heavy. You can carry it for a long time without fatigue, but it has enough mass to steady your hand, and enough size for easy gripping. I find it very instinctive to point and shoot with it. Most of the basic control locations are convenient and easily remembered. (Zoom is manual only, but that suits me. I don't like waiting for motorized zooms to get where I want, especially with a zoom range this long.)I'll leave it to the pro reviewers to discuss the image merits, but I will say that for me they seem perfectly sharp with very good color even at the default settings. In addition, I've gotten very good results shooting at night with very long exposures. (Starry sky, clouds backlit by the moon, streets under moonlight and streetlamps, etc.) Much less noise and \"grain\" than I've experienced with other cameras. So far it's the closest to film I've found in such situations - at any price I can afford, at least.The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is bright and sharp and performs well in low light. I don't miss an optical viewfinder much at all. There's a diopter adjustment to accomodate most people's visiion. (Stops just short of enough for my worst eye - comes closer than most, though - but I find I can use the EFV with my glasses on if I want).One accessory I strongly recommend is a soft rubber, wide angle, lens shade (for a 58mm filter ring). They can be found cheap (I paid $7 at a local store) and will protect the rim of the lens when you set down the camera in addition to shading the lens. There is an included hard-plastic lens shade that clips on the outside of the lens's rim, but t's \"notched\" and I worry about catching it on things - I like the soft rubber ones better (they look more \"pro\" too).  It may interfere with the supplemental illumination lamp for focussing, so you'll want to remove it when shooting close to mid-range photos in dim light.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera-better than I expected!", "Author": "J. Frantz", "ReviewID": "R1X10FRQ4BABZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first day I began teaching a Digital Photo class, my previous camera stopped working. That put me in a hurry to find a replacement. I had my eye on Canon's Digital Rebel XT, but after adding the cost for all the extras I wanted with it, I decided I wasn't prepared to spend quite that much. I took a chance on this one after reading great reviews. A few really bad reviews made me nervous, but now that I have the camera, I have to say it's much better than I thought it would be. The picture quality is great, the options are vast, after a little time with the manual, I'm able to remember how to work all the controls. The ability to focus at close distances is excellent and being able to instantly zoom in and out by adjusting the lens barrell rather than pressing zoom buttons is a real plus. At first, I didn't like the idea of having to use standard Double A batteries. But now I'm sold-I got a couple of sets of modern high power rechargeables and they work very well. If I ever were to be without power, at least I'd be able to pick up a standard pack at a nearby gas station or grocery store. They last longer than the batery packs I used in my previous camera. The only real complaint I have is that the camera RAW format seems more like it's there just to be able to have one more feature to the list for marketing purposes. Yes, it can take pictures in camera RAW format, but getting to the format selector which is hidden in the menu system takes a while. Also, the time the camera needs between shots in RAW mode is much longer, and certain useful options aren't available while in RAW. A minor complaint is that this camera comes with such a small memory card (16 mb) that it isn't possible to take even 1 picture in RAW format with it! It's a minor complaint becausemost cameras come with too low of an amount, and it's a given that a larger card will need to be purchased. I cannot comment on FujiFilm software because I use the Macintosh OS and Photoshop for image transfer and editing. In order for Photoshop CS2 to be able toread the RAW files, you'll have to download a free software add-on from Adobe.com Do a search online for other review sites, especially one that has sample images and full details.

Intermediate to advanced photographers will love this camera as soon as they drop batteries and a CF card in it.  This is an excellent value for a 9MP \"prosumer\" or \"bridge\" camera.  If you are upgrading from a more basic point-and-shoot camera, don't be intimidated by the reviews in which buyers claim that they couldn't take decent photos with this camera.I upgraded from a Fuji point-and-shoot (FinePix 3800) to the S9000 when I decided to learn some of the finer points of photography.  The 3800 had a few settings I could select, but to be honest, I mainly shot in AUTO.  I started researching shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation and ISO settings while the S9000 was on its way to me from buydig.com.  The first hundred or so photos I took were WRETCHED, as I didn't know what I was doing.Once I realized that I could choose the level of automation I wanted, and used the \"A,\" \"S,\" and \"P\" modes properly, I took the best photos of my life!  For example, if I like the automatic settings, except for the shutter speed, I can change to \"S\" mode, and allow the camera to automate everything except the shutter speed I select.  This is the perfect camera for anyone who isn't quite ready for an SLR, but has grown out of the limitations of point-and-shoot.I haven't tried or mastered everything this camera offers yet.  I haven't even shot in RAW mode, yet, but at 9F, my shots are \"magazine quality.\"  I've read that this camera does 90% of what an SLR does for 10% of the price.

I am a semi-pro-am that does photography as a hobby and a job.  I knew I didn't need the $5K camera we have at work, but wanted something more than my $200 point and shoot.  This is it!  Out of the box, it took about 15 min to take my first pic.  Hardest part was threading the camera strap with the lens cap holder - a nice little detail.  The main selling point for me was the \"Natural Light\" mode.  Tried with flash and without in N mode and the quality is amazing.  My little P&S; didn't do any good in low light without flash, this camera gets an A+.A few minor notes I wanted to make before I was lovestruck: The LCD screen has no protection, just kind of out there in the open.  A cover or even just that little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come with would be enough to make me feel like it isn't going to bust.  The viewfinder is really just a mini-LCD screen, which I imagine does a bit of a number on the batteries, though not as much as the full size LCD on the back.  The menu looks pretty extensive, but fairly easy to navigate once it becomes a little more familiar.  So far, I love it, but took off one star because of the LCD issue.  Maybe I can find a cover or something for it to help me feel better about it.Other than that, I can already tell this camera will do everything I need to take great pics and get creative with some manual settings and exposure manipulation.  Love that it takes xD and CF cards - and both can be in the camera at the same time!  Save movies to one, pics to the other!  It feels pretty solid, and takes super inexpensive AA batteries - another selling point for me, as were the hot shoe and sync capabilities.

Set the ISO no higher than 400 (200 or lower is better), and you're fine.The BIOS now supports 6GB Microdrives, and I'd suggest parting with the money.  9MB fine mode (3488 x 2619 pixels) yields over 1,300 photos.

This is by far the best in several ways, but there a couple of annoying things to mention as well.Good:1.  It may sound dumb but I like a heavier camera.  This one is the same weight as a traditional 35mm and therefore I was immediately comfortable with it.  I find that most digital cameras are so light that my excessive caffeine use shakes the camera.2.  It's a good size for people with average or large hands.  Most digital cameras are proportionally too small for someone with average or large hands.3.  There are a lot of adjustments you can make or let it be fully automatic.  I've been impressed with both formats.4.  SUPERIOR zoom capability and close-up capability.5.  Excellent use of eye-viewer, or LCD viewer that can pop out allowing you to view the image while holding the camera above or below your head.6.  Movie quality is quite good as well.7.  Manual is good and within about 5 minutes  I was up and running.Bad1.  For $500+ you'd be surprised at the \"base\" memory card you get.  I didn't want to spend the money and get the package with the 1GB card, so I took the base one.  Plus I wasn't smart enough to notice the deal with the free offer of a 256k card.  So I got the one that came with the camera and it's a whopping 16k.  I took four pictures, YES FOUR PICTURES, and it was full.  For that kind of money I was fairly irritated that they skimped on the card.  Needless to say I hopped over to Walmart and got the cards there and I'm a happy camper.Overall it's the best camera I've ever had and the pictures are superior to prior digitals I've had.

I've used other digitals that frequently ask for a flash due to their small aperature. Flash photography is a difficult art in that I dislike the odd shadows and sharp edges it so frequently produces; so to have the ability to shoot in low light without a flash is a huge plus for me. I also love the manual zoom (28mm wide-angle to 300 mm telephoto) that lets me frame with precision as opposed to a motorized \"it's kinda there\" design. The optics are just fine for me but I've never understood nor appreciated the so-called upper-end optics that you pay ten times an arm and a leg to own. This Fuji produces pictures that are sharp and accurate to my eye (and to others) and I've looked at a lot of cameras and a lot of pictures. The weight, feel, and balance of this cameran is also very comfortable; no doubt a lot of thought went into its overall design. And, being able to use an xD flash card or a microdrive card for storage is another big plus; the potential capacity is enormous and I like having the choice. I use a laptop with a built-in CF microdrive slot so it allows easy transfer in my particular case.

Also note the negative review by Tim X Fujiman (T. Ferris). He voiced his complaints in dpreviews Fuji forum. Others pointed out that this is not a point and shoot but a serious camera that takes some knowledge to get the best out of. After showing him how to do this he now praises the camera.My rating is based on what you get for the price. A DSLR may be a little better but equipped with a comparable lens even the cheapest would cost hundreds more. For all but the most demanding applications the S9000 will do just as well. I have 40+ years as a serious amateur photographer. I have owned 4 SLR Film cameras and an Olympus C4000 Digital. The C4000 takes fine photos but I became frustrated with it's limitations (shutter lag, difficult to get at manual settings, slow shot to shot times, limited Zoom) The s9000 solves all those problems.I have to say this camera is not for everybody. Out of the box the pictures have little in-camera processing and may look a little flat if you're used to a point and shoot. That's because most serious photographers want to do their tweaking out of camera. There are in camera settings that allow you to liven up your pictures but if you are looking for that in your face high contrast saturated color look many point and shoot cameras give out of box you won't get it. If however your looking for natural accurate color rendition look no further. For a camera of this price I found noise levels almost non-existent at 80 and 100 iso, very low at iso 200, low at 400 useable at 800 and high at 1600. The controls were easy to use and most of the common settings could be accessed with one button push. There is some softness in the lens at the corners (typical of long zooms) but it was visible only when blown up to huge size on screen (about 2 feet by 3 feet) Do not judge this camera on initial reactions.

The intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter.  While the S9000 does possess automatic functions to \"streamline\" use, these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that Fuji strove for in it's design.  Let me for clarifications' sake say this loud and clear:  IF YOU WANT BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, VIBRANT PICTURES WITH PERFECT EXPOSURE USING THIS CAMERA, THEN YOU MUST USE THE MANUAL SETTINGS.  THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT TYPE OF A CAMERA!!!!!!  Out of the box the S9000 has been a Godsend.  Not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras, but the exposure is so perfect that I question my ability for luck.  The setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap.  The white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography, and yet Fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design.  There really are two photographic miracles at work in the S9000:  one, is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment, and two, is that the exposure is so good that if I did not know better, I would think that I was using an advanced film SLR.  This is an absolute rave for this product.  The fit and finish are superb, ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use, and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a DSLR but not be too complex.  The only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure, but outside of some DSLRs, this is a problem with all digital cameras.

Here is my review added to the countless ones out there1. S9000 flash has a good reach of 8 to 10 feet in a moderately lighted room. As with all cameras do not be too close to the subject and get washed out image.2. S9000 macro is truly usable and good. I have taken pictures 2 inches from subject in Manual Mode. Works well sharp with no fringing3. The camera's zoom is its selling point. 10X zoom are the best you can get without carrying interchangeable lenses and a DSLR.4. The camera can take both Compact flash and XD card together at the same time. I have them installed. A quick trip through the menu will help you configure either one of them and make them active.5. There is a \"function\" key \"F\" on the camera, Very helpful in a lot of ways be sure to ready about it in the manual to properly use the functionality.6. AE lock feature use is something else which all users should know beforehand to get proper results. (Even help full in automatic mode)7. The camera is smaller than a DSLR both in size and grip.

A Hand! Figure comes up on the display showing that your shot is prone to shake. A very good feature. The camera tells you when to hold still.9. As with all cameras' adequate lighting needs to exist when zooming with a certain degree of stability in your ability to hold the camera still. The camera does have anti blur with faster shutter speeds to compensate the shake but has no built in \"anti shake\" tech. This is not a disadvantage but awareness issue.10. The camera is fast in switch on and very fast at storing all the 9MB mode snaps. Rapid snaps never had a problem either with Compact flash or XD card.RAW mode shooting \"NEVER\" done most of the time generates an 18MB image. It takes 4-5 seconds to store on a XD type H card.I sue it only to take still nature shots and later choose what I want out of a software editor11. The low light grainy image is visible in very low light conditions without flash. Higher ISO's is not the problem by itself. Using Corel, Photoshop, etc you can remove pixilation.12. Finally the camera batteries need to be 2500amph. I use Energizer(tm) gives me 200 clicks with good amount of flash' dispersed in-between. Remember this camera does not have motorized zoom, it is like a DSLR, thus you actually save on your battery.Conclusion is that is worth the money. It is also extremely easy to handle and light. Its features are excellent and out of the box it shoots excellent photos. If you read the manual you will be able to use it like a DSLR even better.

It had all the features I was looking for in one package for my travel needs. Only weeks after I had been using the camera the selector dial quit working making it unable to access certain menus and features reducing it to a fancy point and shoot camera. Then I enlarged some of my photos and realize about 1/5th of the left side of each photo was blurred. The rest of the photo was in focus.  I went into my archive and realized this was the case with each photo I had taken when I pulled them up to 100%. I then inspected my zoom photos and not one of them was in focus when the zoom was used at full extension even with tripod. This all happened while on vacation. When I returned home I mailed in camera to Fuji to be repaired. It was sent back with blur problem on left fixed but zoom was still fuzzy. I informed them I was leaving on another trip and I needed a quick remedy. The only thing they could do was tell me to ship it in once again. I reluctantly shipped in the camera and was sent a different one...which also had problems with fuzzy zoom. I called up in tears telling them the problem was not yet fixed and once again was told to send the camera back in. I was assured they would fix and return it to me in time for my trip. They did overnight fed-ex me a shipping label, so I had some hope that they were on the ball. But I checked the Fed-Ex shipping number just before we left for our trip and I know Fuji had received it a couple days earlier but it had not been logged in by customer service. We were gone for a 10 day trip and I made it back home before the camera was returned from Fuji. They sent me a totally new camera and I've been so disgusted with the whole experience that I won't use the camera. I'm very happy with the Nikon D80 we bought to use on the trip after the S9000 was not returned to us in time.I don't think I will ever buy another Fuji product because I now have serious doubts about their quality control and I'm fed up with their customer service.  If you do plan to buy this camera, buy it with plenty of time to work out the bugs before any important trips.I would give this camera only one star after my experience if not for the fact that it takes great micro macro shots. That was one feature I was  pleased with even when the left side was blurry.  It would be the only reason I would hang onto this camera that has me so frustrated.The good points, great macro mode, fast start up, manual zoom faster and sucks less power than motor controlled zooms, swing out LCD.

Niemi", "ReviewID": "RMVC13GLJIYX2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A few years back when I decided to get into the digital world I started with Minolta's Dimage 5.  It was a good camera, but ate up batteries way too fast - 35-40 shots was all I could get.  I then decided on Fuji's 3800, and what a pleasant surprise.  It was only 3MP but the shots were very good.  After a while I upgraded to the S5000 and again I was pleasantly surprised.  Fuji came through again.  Thinking that 6MP would give me an even better pictures I purchased the S7000 at 6.3MP.  What a great camera that is!!  I've had it for the past two years and haven't been sorry one bit.  But I got antsy once again and started shopping around.  I decided that because I had such luck with Fuji up to this point that the S9000 was the way to go.  If I could get the amazing pictures I'm getting with the 7000 at 6.3MP then 9MP should produce a picture that would be hard to believe.  Wrong!!!  I'm not here to argue with those that think the 9000 is the finest camera on the market, nor am I trying to convince those that think it's the worst camera ever to change their mind.  I can only tell you that I'm disappointed.  What I love is sharp, crisp detail in the photos I produce.  The 7000 does that while the 9000 doesn't.I spent this past weekend shooting the same scenes with the 7000 and 9000 for comparisons.  I printed eight of the scenes, without any retouching, and placed them side by side, then asked four different people which of the photos they liked.  Not one of the photos shot with the 9000 were selected.  In each and every case the shots by the 7000 was the ones they preferred.  The zoom was a disaster.  The 9000 could get in closer; however, the shots were miserable.All I'm saying is if you're looking for super detail in your pictures this may not be the camera for you.  I couldn't rate this as low and one or two stars because it does have some good features, but for me those features don't mean a thing without the detail I'm expecting.  That's why I couldn't go further than three stars.  I'm disappointed in Fuji and a little hesitant about future purchases.  Too bad because it's been great up to this purchase.", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Some pros.. some cons... It all depends what you're looking for.", "Author": "Rose M. Swinson", "ReviewID": "R3MTTLTT60UE1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Auto Focus vs. Manual Focus:I can't see too much of a difference between the two focusing modes.  If there is one, it's minimal.  I can say though, that the auto focus took a bit long to home in on the object I tested on..  The manual focus was a bit awkward because I have to flip a switch on the side and then use the focus ring (not to be confused with the zoom ring).  And THEN I had to try and figure out what the symbols in the viewfinder/LCD meant as I was trying to focus. (for someone that's not accustomed to Fuji's symbols)Now there's two \"perhaps\" that could go with this.  Perhaps the auto focus was slow because it's very cold outside.  It was about 19 degrees when I was out there, so that could have contributed to the problem.  The second is that for the manual focus, perhaps I'll get use to the awkward feeling steps.  It's not *that* bad, but it's not a snap either.10.7x Optical Zoom:When I tested this I found that the optical zoom was VERY good.  And what's nice is that there is no accidently going into digital zoom.  You have to purposely push the up arrow on the menu selector in order to get to digital.  That's a nice setup.  I can't tell you how many times people \"accidently\" go into digital zoom.  YuckWhat I don't like about the zoom - while it is a nice one - is that when zooming at a 10.7x distance you need considerably MORE than their \"anti-blur\" setting. You need some sort of images stabilization (found on Canon cameras, for example).  It needs to be automatic so you don't have to put on a special setting just so you can zoom in on something.Color:I think I can say that I'm pleased at the job it's doing on color.  Most photos I end up doing some sort of color saturation on, even if it's a little bit.  I also usually have to correct something.  This one I didn't have to.  The colors were vivid yet true,  And just in case it's too bright out, this camera comes with a hood for the lens to help with lens flareFuji's Flash:I tested this camera indoors -- both in daylight and at night - high artifical light, low light, etc.  In all cases I found that the flash stength, set on the default setting, is a bit too hard/bright.  It definitely washed colors out.  Perhaps there's a  setting to change the strength .. if there is.. I haven't found it easily (but I haven't checked the book yet either)There is a considerable amount of noise in the higher ISO regions --- almost anything after 800 ISO.  Now I know that someone previously mentioned \"just don't shoot in those ISO ranges\" .. easier said than done.  In \"auto\" mode if the ISO needs to be that high, it'll go.  And besides, Fuji is marketing it as being superb in noise reduction and I have found that to be -- well.. really incorrect.Final Conclusions:All in all, I feel that this camera is a good replacement for one of our older models.  Outdoors the colors are true but inside the flash tends to wash them out a bit.  The longer zoom is a definite plus - and so is the \"anti blur\" setting on the dial.  It's only too bad it's not built into ALL the settings on the camera, such as Canon's IS S1/S2 line (IS - image stabilization).  Macro mode wasn't really tested too closely, but I feel it can handle it well.  Zoom is handled from the zoom ring on the barrel of the lens. IMO, much better than having a rocker switch or something.  I always get confused w/ those and end up going one way when I want to go another.  There is no accidental going into digital zoom mode.  In order to get there you have to hit the little up arrow on the menu wheel (not difficult).  So unless you accidently hit it, don't worry about digital zoom.I prefer the auto focus over the manual focus.  Sometimes our eyes don't quite work right and setting the diopler (? - eye piece) to the correct setting can sometimes be a challenge, depending on how tired my eyes are at any given moment.The flash is automatically suppressed unless you release it.  While that's definitely it takes the \"auto\" out of the auto features.  If I'm shooting on auto, I'd really rather not worry about if there's enough light.  However it is nice that you can close it and force a no-flash situation w/out worrying about it popping back up.The camera takes both Xd Picture cards and CF cards.  I have a lot of CF cards around here so I don't have to worry about picking up new/different media.", "Date": "December 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good fixed lens camera, 9 mp stills and VGA video", "Author": "L. G. CHARLOT", "ReviewID": "R2BM4AG9DLXA6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I went shopping for a new high quality digital camera to replace my aging Minolta 7i, I made up a list of features and functions that I wanted:1. Powered by \"AA\" batteries.  I dislike proprietary battery packs, which generally cost at least 4 times more than a set of four \"AA\"'s.2. Compact Flash Memory.  At the time, CF was the most economical memory option.  As of November 2007, CF and SD cards cost about the same, so memory type isn't as much of a concern.3. Ability to shoot stills and VGA video.  Only fixed lens cameras offer this, so I was not considering a D-SLR.4. 10x or better zoom lens with manual zoom ring for fine control, and ability to change zoom while shooting video (some cameras lock the zoom while shooting video).5. At least 8 megapixels.  The more resolution, the more a photo can be cropped.6. Good image quality on both stills and video.  Of course, no fixed-lens P&S; camera can compare in image quality to a D-SLR like the Canon D-40 or Sony Alpha A-700, but I needed the ability for both stills and video, which D-SLR's can't do (yet).7. RAW image capture with lots of manual control.  As it worked out, I have never used RAW other than for a few sample photos, so this requirement wasn't really necessary.8. 28mm wide angle.  Many cameras in this category have lenses that offer only 35mm wide angle, which can really cramp your ability to shoot large landscape features, architecture, or indoor rooms.As of November 2007, I have shot about 5000 stills and 4 hours of video clips with my S-9000, and have been pretty pleased with the image quality. Auto-Focus is reasonably fast, and usually much more reliable than the old Minolta 7i I used to use.  At ISO levels up to 200, the images are crisp and colors are very good.  ISO 400 is still pretty good, but at ISO 800 the images get too noisy to be pleasing.  The electronic viewfinder is pretty good, even in twilight conditions it's useable. I rarely use the LCD panel because it drains the batteries a lot faster than the EVF, but it is handy for viewing stored images and making menu selections.Other notable features of the S-9000:-Dual Media.  The camera can mount both a CF card and an XD card.  Switching between them requires a trip through about three levels of the menu, however.  I usually only use the XD card if the CF card has been filled to capacity and I am still shooting.  The XD card seems to be slower than the CF card, and I have had trouble shooting video on it.Things I like about the S-9000:-Uses \"AA\" batteries-Lots of manual controls, or just shoot Program mode if you want to go automatic.-Captures really nice VGA video, and you can zoom the lens while capturing video (some cameras lock the zoom in Video capture mode).-Still image quality as good as I have ever seen from a point-and-shoot.  Nice large lens with manual zoom control.  Manual focus (electronic focus-by-wire).-Feels good in the hand, ergonomics similar to an SLR.Some shortcomings of the 9000S:-Lousy sound quality on videos, but that's to be expected.  I don't know of ANY digital still camera that has \"good\" audio.  If you want good sound, buy a video camcorder and equip it with an external shotgun microphone.-Menu system buries some frequently used commands too deep (this is a minor annoyance).-I think that image transfer is USB-I, not USB-II.  Downloading a full 2 gig CF card takes FOREVER.  This issue can be worked around by using an external USB-II card reader.-No optical image stabilization.  The 10X zoom lens is really nice, but at full telephoto, camera shake can really fuzz out your pictures if you don't have a tripod.  Many super zoom cameras, even cameras in this price range, have some kind of image stabilization that moves either the sensor or a lens element to compensate for shaky hands.-When shooting video, the lens is Auto focus only; you can't set manual focus when shooting video.  This is a serious problem in scenes with low contrast, for example seascapes on foggy days.  When I took the camera to Alaska last May, many of the video clips I shot in Resurrection Bay on a cloudy/foggy day were ruined by the camera frequently losing focus lock and \"hunting\" back and forth to try and re-establish focus.CONCLUSION:  At the current street price of $379, the S9000 offers a lot of value, if you can live with it's few shortcomings (the video focus problems being the most serious).  If you need a single camera that can shoot really nice stills and VGA video, this one is an excellent choice.  For more serious photography needs, a \"real\" digital SLR with a bagful of assorted lenses will be more versatile and offer better low-light images; couple this with a high-def camcorder (The Canon HV20 is getting rave reviews) and you will have all bases covered, but at a price of at least several thousand dollars more than the S9000 will cost you.  Even if you are a serious D-SLR owner already, the S9000 could be a valuable back-up camera for use in environments or situations where you might not want to risk damage to more expensive equipment.****UPDATE: June 9, 2009. The Manual Control dial on my S9000 has failed. Without it, the camera is now only functional in full Auto or Program AE modes. The loss of this control dial has effectively crippled the camera; without it, I can't use Shutter or Aperture Priority, can't set exposure compensation levels, can't use multiple exposure bracketing, and can't change about a dozen other settings that are now stuck at the factory defaults. Sending the camera in for service would cost at least $150, and there's no guaranty that this problem could be repaired for less than the purchase price of, say, a brand new Canon SX-1is, so I guess, after 6500 photos taken, my S9000 will be relegated to the museum drawer where I keep my ancient film cameras including an early 70's Pentax Spotmatic.", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Totally Amazing", "Author": "R.

It's been the love of my life for years. This camera is quite capable of almost all the things that a DSLR can do. It's extremely fast when you turn it on. It's fast at saving photos. It's fast with multiple continuous shots. Bees? Bees flying? They're no match for this camera. It's quick. It's easy. Compared to the new Canon Rebel T1i, the Fujifilm is only a little bit slower and lower in quality even though it's a 6 MP difference.It can get as close as an inch of a subject using the macro setting. I love love love the macro setting. Helloooo close-up bright flowers and yummy food shots. No need to buy expensive lenses. The colors are wonderful. The contrast is high. Changing the different settings is easy. The picture quality is high. I have printed large posters using pictures taken from this camera and I've never had to worry about the quality. I mostly use ISO 80-200 so I don't ever get grainy images.All these wonderful things can be achieved using this camera ... if you read the manual and have some basic understanding of photography.I have had friends who spent more money on Canon Rebels and have their pictures come out looking terrible because they don't read the manual and they have no basic understanding of photography, like ISO, shutter speed, aperture, and the combination of those three. My pictures rarely come out blurry or grainy. It's so easy to change the ISO setting on this camera that I change it all the time to get the best shots. Manual mode is also extremely easy to maneuver, so changing shutter speed and aperture is a breeze as well.  Night shots are amazing and easy to take because the manual mode lets me control my shutter speed any way I want, for however long I want.I bought rechargeable Duracell batteries and they last me about 500 shots. They do make the camera a lot heavier, but what the hey, I'm glad I don't have to drag around telephoto lenses all the time. Which leads me to the zoom. 28mm-300mm. The lenses aren't detachable, but with that kind of zoom, there's no need to buy other lenses. The flash is pretty quick at recharging, although I rarely use it, so I can't say much on it.

If you decide this camera is right for you I strongly advise you buy this. It charges in 15 minutes and lasts days compared to regular 1 day batteries. But aside from the batteries I would also like to say that the presettings are pretty decent. They work for what I like to photograph and it pays off, however I just prefer to use the manual mode, it is more maneuverable and lets you do more with the shot. The noise is pretty good on it, its not to bad, and the built in flash is good. I just bought an external flash though. (works better). Another VERY good thing on the S9000 is the pop out screen! That screen has helped me more then I can imagine.

This camera can do so much, even the video is excellent!The white balance is almost always perfect, and photos taken in natural light look amazing.

Macdonald", "ReviewID": "R1UYDLS4B5BX6H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the S9500 (Australia) about a month ago and am very dissapointed with it's image quality.  Normal 6\" x 4\" prints were OK, but I was shocked when a friend at a camera shop took two images -  one with the S9500 and one with a entry level DSLR and I saw the results.  He had the prints enlarged to 8\" x 12\" and when I saw the results I knew I had really made the wrong decision in buying this camera! The image was soft and had quite noticeable grain even at ISO 100!  We compared the S9500 print with the DSLR print and there was no comparison at all.  The print was sharper and grain free. I bought this camera on Fuji's claims of low noise, real photo technology etc. I am used to high image quality having owned a Nikon SLR film camera and expected better from this camera.  It looks like a DSLR, feels like a DSLR and even has controls like a DSLR.  It produces images though that any compact camera for half the price can produce.  If you care anything about image quality (after all you may want to enlarge those special prints to 8\" x 12\" etc) do yourself a favour and buy an entry level DSLR.  I am taking this camera back to the shop and buying a Nikon D70s - a camera I know is capable of large, noise free prints.  I guess the 'Super CCD' technology just can't make a small sensor as noise free as a large DLSR sensor despite the hype.  I will not be buying any Fuji products again - this experience has even turned me off their film.  I had a frustrating time trying to convince myself for nearly a month that it was me and not the cameras fault.  But when you have a shop photographer with 30 years + experience fail to get good results from the S9500 then you know it is a failure.  He even said that he said he expected much better results from it as they sell Fuji. The only positive things I can say is that its really looks like a real DLSR and uses AA batteries (which can be convenient).  It also has a 'reasonable' build quality. Please make sure that if you do decide to buy this camera (it will suit some buyers) that you can return it for refund/exchange if not happy. Fuji really needs to be careful about their claims about this camera, on spec it looks absolutely fantastic!  Please decide carefully and consider spending that bit extra for an entry level DSLR - you will not regret it!", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Fuji...what happened I want my money back", "Author": "T.

I've owned 4 Fuji Digital Cameras to date and this WAS the 5th. From the moment I took the first picture I noticed the image quality was way off.I have a Fuji E550 and it took better picture that the S9000. I called Fuji Support line thinking I was doing something wrong and they could not figure it out. I had to return the camera. All this after selling my Fuji S7000. What a stupid move that was. I thought I was upgrading but in fact I did a super down grade.Like I said maybe I received a lemon. The image quality was not sharp at all. The edges were dull, the color was not vivid like the S7000. Focusing indoors was extremely slow. I love taking picture of my 21month old son and I couldn't enjoy the grainy images. The flash was useless. I tried everything. I read the manual cover to cover trying to figure it out, but I couldn't. I did love the way the camera was setup but that's it. Fuji's Support line asked me to do a number of things but none of them worked. Closeup / Long range / full Zoom nothing looked good.Man what a disappointment, a $548.95 disappointment. Even my wife said the pictures were awful. She said \"wasn't this suppose to be an upgrade?\" I told her \"I thought the same thing\".My camera history is:Fuji 2800Zoom (2MP) very good camera great picture quality.Fuji 3800Zoom (3MP) OK camera great picture quality.Fuji A205 (2MP) not worth the time to rate it.Fuji S5000 (3MP) very good camera wonderful picture quality.Fuji S7000 (6 / 12MP) great camera, great picture quality.Fuji S9000 (9MP) great camera setup, awful picture quality.I'm going to but the Nikon CoolPix 8800, it cost a little more but I need quality images.I tried to buy another Fuji S7000 but had no luck. I want a new one not used.Tim x fujimanUPDATE:I received a replace ment from buydig.com and I'm getting the same results.  Very noisy images, Dull images.  Not sharp at all.  I guess I didn't get a lemon in the first place.  Fuji just slapped me across the face with this one.  I'm never buying Fuji again.  I'm done.", "Date": "December 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "worst camera I've ever had", "Author": "David Sauceda Saldivar", "ReviewID": "R2TXN0JG55HMNS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Hmm just ordered this", "Author": "Susan Ashe \"Sue\"", "ReviewID": "R1OL9RP7R8TXSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this and sent it right back - the S5200 is just fine by me - this one has the one thing I wanted - the zoom capability during video taping BUT it had little else to justify the 100 or so more dollars over my S5200 - and the lens was bulky and huge and that was how the zoom worked - unlike the ease of the S5200 which has two small in and out buttons on the back that I can use with my same shutter hand during concerts.
