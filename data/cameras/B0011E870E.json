Fieselman", "ReviewID": "RIT0RZ3AYRMUL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the Olympus FE-310 camera for about one month.  The camera takes great pictures and is easy to operate.  This camera seems pretty good overall.  There are a few things that I wish I had known before I made this purchase however.1.  The 2 AA batteries do not last very long.  The digital screen is easy to see, but drains the batteries far too quickly.  You cannot turn off the digital screen without turning the camera off.  Be aware that you may need one or more battery changes per day if you are shooting a moderate amount of pictures.  This camera has frozen up twice because it needed a battery change immediately following my attempt to take a picture. When I started the shot the battery indicator showed full and then it failed to record the photo because the battery was dead.  There is no midpoint on the battery indicator.  I don't know if I got a bad camera or if everyone has the same problem.2.  This has been mentioned by another user but it is worth noting, this camera reverts to default settings each time it is turned on.  There is no way to save your personal preferences.  This is a big deal!  Imagine being at an event where you need to shoot a picture once every minute or so with an adjusted setting.  As I have said, leaving the camera on would nearly guarantee a battery change within an hour.  Now each time you turn the camera back on you find yourself adjusting for flash off or whatever special setting you need while your photo opportunity escapes!  Had I known about this weakness I would have purchased another camera.3.  The shutter button and zoom control are located in the same spot.  It is a bit tricky to operate effectively but it can be done with some practice.All things considered this would be a great camera if I didn't use it so often.  I like it enough to keep it, but use caution if this camera is for work or regular moderate use.", "Date": "May 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is a no-brainer to operate!", "Author": "Patricia L.

I wanted AA batteries (I travel a lot with no outlets), at least a 5X zoom and some sort of image stabilization.  The 2 gig card gives over 400 pics on the highest resolution so no worrys about downloading often on the go.  The image stabilization is not active, what it does is ups your shutter speed so it's not really image stabilized.  Battery life is good not great probably because of the large LCD on the back of the camera.  A viewfinder would have been nice.  All and all I doubt you could find a better camera for the amount of money.  Pictures are great, 5X zoom is nice, optical zoom is great, digital zoom has only limited use because it sacrifices quality, but it does zoom way in.  A nice feature is that if you wonder about how to set the camera there is a guide mode and a scene mode that will make it very easy for you.", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great features - extremely poor battery usage", "Author": "Gamul \"Gamul1\"", "ReviewID": "R1NORQJ5X8OSQ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera and has excellent features.

Camera won't work at all.  Duracell? I get around 10 pictures on each set. Only the panasonic industrials work \"ok\".I complained to Olympus and they denied any issue, only saying I needed to use a good enough AA.  Buzz off to them!

I haven't yet tried the panorama feature, but everything is explained clearly in the book, and just taking your camera and going thru step-by-step, you will see how easy it is to use!!

MacDonald", "ReviewID": "RZVHFVEJKBMVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I also bought this camera and  experienced poor battery life. After reading the reviews I was ready to box it up and ship it back. At the last minute I decided to give it another try and work the batterys. I bought 2 each of every battery that said digital camera. I also measured the short circuit current of each type of battery. What I found is this camera (and every camera that uses AA's) needs high current NOT high capacity.The flash is essentially a dead short. When the engineers built the bigger zoom (5X) they made the flash bigger. The bigger flash it put a hugh load on the batterys. The best batterys that I found were the Hybrios (new style NiMh that holds it charge for a year another benefit). The Sony high current also worked. When I tested it with fresh charged batterys I gave up after 80 consecutive forced flashs in a row and I got tired of testing. Previously I could get about ten flashes before the batterys failed. This included alkaline as they do not like being shorted. So bottom line is you need about 8 amps short circuit current to make the camera live. Six amps short circuit does not work and the age of the cells counts for a lot. I have tried these cells in a DSLR with the same results they last a long time.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy -use, 8MP, low price. but not perfect", "Author": "William Metcalfe \"Snapperman\"", "ReviewID": "R21TA614MQN2C1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Olympus digital. I wanted something I could slip in a pocket, rather than hang around my neck all day. It's not too small for my sausage fingers, all I need to take fast, easy photos. The 310 is hard on batteries, I keep 2 sets of re-chargeables spare,but would carry more on a big trip. That is my only real criticism.  Since I wrote this review 4 months back I have got a little more skilled and a little less enthusiastic for the FE-310. As other reviewers have said the camera settings revert to the default on switching off which can be exasperating at times. I should have brought a model with view finder too, bright sunlight on the screen makes it difficult to see your subject. Flashlight shots are only any good if one is fairly close in, but the worst feature is battery failure.  Not all re-chargeable NIMH batteries are compatible, be sure to stick with top name brands.

The model out on display had a toggle telephoto on the back, and the sales clerk assured me that it wouldn't change back to default on my settings.  Well, when I got the box home and opened it, to my surprise, the telephoto was that little ball thing in the front again, and again, if you turn off the camera, it will default to AUTO.This one is going back too.  I have now owned 7 Olympus digital cameras.Here's my review of the FE340:  I am a fan of Olympus products, and have owned 5 previous Olympus digital cameras. I was hoping this model would become my new primary photo machine. The price was right, I was attracted by the nifty BLUE color: But dissappointment set in after I took it out of the box. The two features that caused me to return the camera are:#1) the telephoto control is awkward, a pin head sized ball on the front of the camera. I don't know why Olympus decided to get away from the eminently sensible toggle switch on the back which the right thumb could toggle while holding the camera steady with two hands.#2) was the killer though. Whenever the camera was turned off, when you turn it back on it resets itself to the AUTO setting. It didn't hold my setting of FLASH OFF. That resulted in an embarrassing moment in a very solemn situation where expressly there was NO FLASH ALLOWED.At that moment, I knew the camera was going back to the store.I want a camera that holds MY settings, not reverts to the default.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera!", "Author": "Karla Goddard \"legalass17\"", "ReviewID": "R1QCQRZGA8N5JR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with such  high hopes only to be crushed.  It takes horrible pictures!  I am accustomed to using a Cannon at work so when I saw this 8MP camera on sale at the local Radio Shack I jumped on it.  It is the perfect size for me to throw into my purse and I had already a bunch of XD memory cards.  Bad choice.  It will not focus for me in the zoom position although I have read the instruction booklet and tried all of the suggestions. About the only way it will take a good picture is if you are outside, good lighting and you are not using the zoom function.  I bought a loser camera.  Do not make the same mistake that I did. The Cannon I use at work focuses in all lighting situations, takes good video and night time pictures.  I should have spent the extra money to get it.  I am sooooo sorry now.  I gave it a decent amount of trying and they won't take the camera back because I have had it over 14 days. I hope this helps someone else out.

Several times I've gotten the no battery warnig on the screen where the camera locks up, & hopefully if I wait a few minutes the batteries gain a little charge so I can take a picture or two before it dies again. Carrying extra batteries was a MUST. ( But should be not necessary )I won't itemize all the concerns, ( soft focus, reset of settings each time it powers up, etc.) as there's a good review on the main page. But as an old 35mm SLR user, I'm used to an optical viewfinder, & just using the screen resulted in too many cut off heads & legs because of the times the screen washed out from bright light & then guessing.I just purchased a Fuji S1000fd & one of the reasons..........besides the screen, OPTICAL VIEWFINDER !", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Won't Work With Rechargable Batteries", "Author": "Michael Clouser \"Donutman\"", "ReviewID": "RJLVG5VS1TJUA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't buy this camera!!!

I still kept the camera for a month, taking photos in different settings, indoors and outdoors, and still I felt the photos should have been better for an 8 megapixel camera.

We sent the camera in for repairs and got the same one back. I had if for about a month and then realized that the pictures had colored flairs on the screen and the pictures. So we send it back in and they sent the same camera back with the SAME PROBLEM!!! We sent it to Olympus again and they said that they would send me a Sylus 840 free of charge instead of the 310. I'm not sure what happened, if I just got a bad one or if all the cameras are like that.PS: I don't want to say anything terrible against Olympus but the people that work there are (we think) totally illiterate!

Still have this camera now that it is going to the ending of 2013. I agree with every reviewer that has said that this camera runs through batteries quickly. It does. I always keep extra on hand. The camera takes AA batteries so pretty easy to find. If you get annoyed with changing batteries a lot, then get the lithium or much more expensive batteries that will last longer. I always keep a spare pair of batteries for the camera on hand on matter what camera I use. I also purchased the 2GB card to go with the camera. Both were delivered quickly and the price was right. It worked fine when I first received it and has pretty much ever since.I am not a hugely picky person and do not know why people would really want a camera like this if you are looking for a camera that works like a professional camera does. Would recommend for beginners and people who are not using the camera to do all sorts of tricks that professionals use a high end camera for. If you are just looking to get that kind of quality cheaply, that just does not happen. Try investing in a professional camera then. You get what you pay for. I just purchased this as someone who wants to take pictures on vacations and different events as a point and shoot type of camera. I am reading complaints about wanting a viewfinder at the same time batteries draining, but if you are taking pictures in a brightly lit area then why are you even bothering to use a flash? Taking the flash setting off saves a little on the battery life. Sounds more like someone who wants to get professional quality photos using a cheap camera.As for the camera resetting to default when turned off. It does. I am absolutely fine with that. I usually only use the basic settings and do not need to keep fiddling with the camera trying to get that perfect setting for that perfect shot. If I wanted that all the time, that would be why I would purchase a professional camera for. The cameras that you are dropping a lot more than what you are for this discount camera. I actually take the batteries out and store them elsewhere for later use when I am not using the camera, since it will automatically default to automatic when I turn it back on.Overall the camera works fine and has been since I received it and that is all I was looking for. Again, if you are looking for a camera that gives high end camera results then you should be looking elsewhere to invest in a professional camera.

I sought out and bought this one because I was so pleased with the performance and size of the original.  One of the features I had purchased the first one for was a setting specifically for taking photos of items for eBay. That is one of the many \"standard\" settings on this camera and it really is worth having. I like the size as it is small enough to carry in my purse so that I can catch photos of particularly outstanding flowers when I come across them.  I have seen my photos up against professional close-ups of flowers and have seen no difference.  So why should I spend $600 or more!  That the camera uses AA batteries and never has to be on a charger is terrific.  I just carry along a couple of extra batteries just in case and if I don't have them I can duck into any convenience store and buy some.  Battery life is, however, excellent so I rarely have to pop in new ones in any hurry. There are drawbacks of course too.  My only complaint is that the camera is so small that it is sometimes hard to get a clear picture when you are snapping photos at an event.  There is an anti-shake setting but I usually forget.  For photographing website or eBay items I use a tripod.  I have only used the camera to computer USB hookup once and it was not difficult.

Still, I regret buying it.- Battery life can be solved by using lithium batteries and turning down the screen brightness when you have a longer time between shots. It's not really that big of an issue if you do these two things.- The white balance is terrible! You can't adjust it all. Cameras at half this price have several different WB settings. This is just auto WB. Pathetic.- Any time you are using zoom, the auto-focus becomes hit-or-miss. I have lost many good shots because the camera just won't focus. Macro shots usually won't focus, either.- Almost no manual control. You can adjust the exposure comp and the ISO. That's it. And the ISO only goes up to 640.- Image stabilisation is bogus. It just changes the shutter speed, which changes everything in your shot. Worse than worthless.I will say that the video is decent, though far from HD resolution. Even in this case, though, you must turn the sound recording off if you want to use auto-focus.Honestly, this is one of the worst purchases I have ever made.

On the subject of this camera's BATTERY USAGE, that at least one previous reviewer  has raised, it's better than the 2 other digital cameras that I had before in that it does NOT quickly \"EAT\" them up, and please also keep in mind that this camera uses the \"everyday,\" and cheaper, easier-to-find \"AA\" Alkaline etcetera batteries, unlike the far more EXPENS$IVE CR-2 and CR123 Camera/Photo Battteries that I've had to use on two other cameras. So, given my experience with previous digital cameras(one a Kodak 5.0 megapixel, the other a Vivitar model camera)which both DID actually \"EAT\" up their batteries, this one has had GOOD to Very good battery life, from my experiences(* only shot 2 xD cards through it, NOT a \"huge amount of experience\" with the camera, I will admit), so for the more circumspect, I would say that this Olympus camera offers very much, SATISFACTORY battery life, in comparison to other/earlier digital cameras. I WOULD always bring along at least 1-2 extra pairs of back-up \"AA\" batteries, however, on just about any shoot where you need to travel even a short distance from \"modern,\" ah-hem, \"Civilization\". As for photo-picture quality, this Olympus has really delivered for me, with very high quality digital photos, be they online or printed-out through my Canon Photo Printer, and going by friends' digital photos that's not just due to my present Olympus FE-310 having the higher(8.0 Megapixels) megapixel performance rating.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life", "Author": "B.

We sent it to the service center who kept it for a month, sent it back the week before Christmas claiming it was fixed and as soon as we popped in new batteries it died again.  Thank goodness we still had our old Sony for use at Christmas that year.  We sent this camera back again and this time they told us it was our fault - we needed to use a more powerful battery.  We didn't before, but o.k., I bought the most powerful rechargable AA's I could find and we can usually get a whole day out of them now before they need recharged.In the last month however it has now started taking only half the picture or worse - not at all.
