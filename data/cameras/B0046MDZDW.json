The field of view is very tiny and it requires bright daylight to record anything. During the evening with normal household lighting it records nothing but shadows.

Turner", "ReviewID": "R33G4FNKQ5PO9C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It looks and behaves like a normal clock. Programming only offers a 24 hour clock, not a daily setting.  For example, I wanted to video M-T from 6am-6pm and shorter times on W-F so it would have to be reprogrammed or you risk running out of memory faster.  I tried a larger memory chip, but the card gets extremely hot.  You can't designate certain times for each day.  This combined with the small memory forces me to empty the card each evening - I found this to be inconvenient.  It does work, but the image quality isn't great.  Had to keep it on the lowest grade so it wouldn't consume the memory. Overall it performs good for the price.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy usage -picture quality can be improved", "Author": "2liveCrew", "ReviewID": "R3JB10GZ1FJ2NL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it from Amazon.

First unit: SD card is blank, no files and screen is all blotchy on setup, setup functions are no longer evident, controls, do not work. I bought two units, will now check the second for function, it is in my suitcase and used during travel at hotels. Both were purchased in May, one is junk in November and all files lost for last trip. I cleared old files and set up unit the night before we left. Came back to no files on SD Card. It is plugged into a power brownout protector so power fluctuation should not be the cause.  In this order I also bought a separate different type of unit and it never worked either. Mounted it to a shed outside and came back to no files on very first trip.

Simply set the side switch to Time or Alarm and press the Hour or Minutes buttons on top.- Camera is practically invisible.  You will need to shine a light directly into it to see where it is.- Use of SD card.  I did not want an external recording device so the SD fit my requirement.- Adjustable frame capture.  Options on how many frames per second that the video will capture.  Memory usage will depend on setup.  With mine, 100mb is equivalent to about 1hr50min at 2 fps.- Motion detection.  Haven't tried this one yet but I like the fact that the option is available.- Simple manual record start/stop.  Just pop off the cover (I did not re-install the small screw that comes with it), press REC or STOP, and replace the cover.Cons:- Video images are not that bright.  However, this may be due to the plastic cover that is necessarily tinted to hide the presence of the camera.- No audio.  But then again, audio is not a requirement for me.- Requirement of video connection for initial setup.  You will need to hook up the video output to configure the camera.  Afterwards, I just remove the SD card when I want to review the videos in my computer.Pretty quick delivery too.
