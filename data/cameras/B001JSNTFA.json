Got it home and replaced the battery and it works! Then I started to do some research and discovered the camera came out in 1980 (when I graduated High School) and takes 110 film (I thought it was a 35mm camera.) So, the laugh's on me. It only cost me $3 to get schooled. No pun intended.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001JSNTFA"}}
