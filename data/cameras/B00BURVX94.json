This is my very first non-cheap point and shoot camera.  I have children and was tired of missing photos because my camera was too slow or the picture quality was blurry. So I decided to invest in a \"bridge\" camera and liked the idea of a glass lens.  I also liked the 50x optical zoom for when my child is presented an award on a stage very far away. This zoom is phenomenal, and the photo looks as if I was right in front of it. I tested it on a flying kite and the photo captured all the detail in the ribbing that I didn't notice from the ground.  The pictures are unbelievable crisp and beautiful.  There are so many options for color saturation that make flowers look more lovely.  I highly recommend this camera and this pack. It comes with an extra battery and everything fits in the case provided.  I love this pack!", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to use.

The DSC-HX300 allows me to take my kind of pictures that come out really well for me, and provides feed back on the settings after I take the pictures.

We researched cameras and the Sony Cyber-shot came in high.  We've only had the camera since Christmas.  Took some pictures of friends about 800 feet away and they turned out great.  The camera does great taking pictures inside using only the existing light, it never needed the flash.  It is easy to use and we would highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Wanda Elam", "ReviewID": "R3EEE1ANQ95R34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this camera. I am still learning many new things about it. The zoom on this is amazing. It takes very good action shots too. Only drawback I have found is images are sometimes blurry if you're very shaky. The generic battery that came with it was a piece of junk. It would not hold a charge in camera so it was worthless. Would have been nice if Sony put a little more detailed manual with camera. Going online is sometimes a big pain.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amateur Photographer's Delight!", "Author": "L. A. Cobb \"Tuesday Friend\"", "ReviewID": "R3A646AJ0QL4EE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of the box I able to take photos that are the quality I've always wanted even before I knew what the camera could REALLY do.  I used a Pentax 35mm with changeable telephoto lenses most of my life and I was looking for an \"all in one\" type that would be easier to carry.  This camera met that desire and more.  The 50X optical zoom quality is amazing and the lens quality, being Zeiss, produces crisp, gorgeous shots even through windows.  The multi-shot capability (sports) is awesome.  I do recommend having an extra battery and charger because you'll want to take more photos than ever.  The battery charge lasts a very respectable time but it's always nice to have that back-up and still have use of the camera while the extra battery charges.  Buying the package, as I did, gives you everything you need except for a \"dummy cord\" for your lens cap.  I do recommend one as you'll have so much fun with this camera you may forget where you left the lens cap.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera and great package", "Author": "Mary C.
