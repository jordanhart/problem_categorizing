This camera is amazing!! Very user friendly, which is nice when you are starting out. I ordered late the Friday before Thanksgiving and received it the following Wednesday!! Talk about awesome shipping time. I was so excited. The only thing that failed for work in this package for me was the card reader. Everything else was in perfect condition. I registered my camera and lens on the Nikon website (do this as soon as you open your package because there is a time window.) This is an amazing deal and a great bang for your buck.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice", "Author": "Randyroo \"crazyr1010\"", "ReviewID": "R2AYBD99KT0VPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After giving up my trusty Canon F-1, an ancient film camera from the 1970's I wanted the same type of performance from a D-SLR. The Nikon D-3200 fits the bill with A/P, S/P, manual and auto modes, though I am still learning how to change aperture, shutter speed, etc. through software instead of turning a knob. The principle is the same just taking a bit of time to get used to. Image quality is excellent even when enlarged to ridiculous proportions. Cameta Camera has an excellent package if you are in the market for this camera, and you cannot beat the price. The same camera plus the 55-200 mm lens costs as much at Walmart as the entire package from Cameta without the bag, tripod, extra lenses, cleaning kit etc.Excellent service and delivered on time.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Starter Bundle", "Author": "sme168 \"sme168\"", "ReviewID": "R28CM5PGNE7BWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've upgraded from a point-and-shoot camera to a DSLR. I wanted the Nikon D3200 because it came highly recommended by a friend, has great reviews, and the specifications are exactly what I need to take my photography to the next level.I came across the Cameta Camera bundle and it is a wonderful deal--good prices and good equipment.Before purchasing this deal, I looked Cameta Camera up on the BBB.org website--I was pleased to see they have an A+ rating. I placed my order on Saturday evening and the package was at my door by Tuesday--that's fast shipping!

I think I was dreaming to own an SLR for over an year and what a purchase this one has been. The package as so many accessories that I can't even comprehend when I would actually get to use all of that. For now, I am in love with my D3200 RED DSLR and I beginning to learn how to use it. It is so beginner friendly that one can learn most of the stuff by themselves. The camera is gorgeous. The packaging was impeccable. The lenses make the camera look even more appealing. Once I learn how to use all those features, I am definately going to buy a 55-300mm lens. Thumbs up to this dealer for coming up with such an amazing scheme.I really want to post a picture of it which I took and added to my Facebook and it recieved many likes. I can post it here too but I don't know how to.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon D3200 bundle Pack", "Author": "Christopher M.

I decided to purchase this kit after my Nikon D80 went out on me. After doing a lot of research I figured this was the best deal, and I was right! The kit arrived in a huge box! I wasn't for sure what it was since it was so big! I spent the better half of my afternoon taking everything out of the box and trying to stuff it all in my camera bag (I decided to use my old camera backpack instead of the one that comes with it). Everything is exceptional quality! I have already played with it, using the different lenses and the different filters and have not been disappointed. It has taken a little getting used to the difference between this one and the D80.
