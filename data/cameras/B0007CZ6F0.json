To date, only one digital camera can go underwater without some sort of special housing and that is this camera, the Pentax Optio WP.  It is small, light, and has a very intuitive set of menus (who needs the manual, this thing is darned easy to use).  That said, if you are looking for a general purpose point and shoot digital camera, look elsewhere.  The quality of the photos are only average at best.  Despite the 5 megapixels, significant detail is lost in the capture of the photograph.  Noticeable fuzziness exists on the perimeter of all photos.  Close inspection (zoom in with your favorite photo editor) shows a great deal of pixelation (read interpolation).  My guess is the CCD sensor in the Optio isn't grade A.  Don't misunderstand, I want to like this camera, but I've used too many that yield better photos (for Point & Shoot, the Canon Elph still can't be topped, if you are an enthusiast go Nikon or Olympus C Series).So in the end, it will go in my camera bag where it will stay until the trips to the beach and the water park... because after all, that's why I bought it!", "Date": "July 16, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best waterproof digicam", "Author": "K. Weaver", "ReviewID": "R8IKN3MJF6OYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When shoppping for a waterproof digital camera to use while river floating, I was drawn to this one. Small, sleek & stylish, it's better looking and has better resolution than any of the other offerings. I've only used mine on one trip, but I already like it. Although I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of an optical viewfinder, the large LCD is bright enough to use in sunshine with sunglasses on. A few of my photos came out blurry even though the beep indicated the autofocus had locked. These were photos of other boats coming toward me rapidly while I was sitting in my boat, so my movement may have contributed. I need to experiment with the continuous AF and high-speed shooting modes to perfect these shots. It's great that the camera offers you so many options of AF and shooting modes. It also offers a large array of options for tweaking your images in the camera, from adding a frame to eliminating red-eye. This makes me think it might be feasible to print good hard copies without using a computer, something I never considered with other cameras.All in all, I'd say this is a very good do-it-all, take-it-anywhere camera, with the bonus of it being waterproof.

Why? Because is was always there! It is extremely convenient, very quick to power up and fast enough for true snap shots (in good day light). The picture quality using the presets is amazingly good (that's coming from a control freak who never uses automated settings), and the under-water shots were excellent as well (in clear water). I was a little worried about it truly being waterproof, but it is! I had it in the pool just about every day and in the Ocean several times as well-it never failed.I am impressed and have enjoyed this little gem more then I imagined. Short battery life, especially when using flash, and flash reach is poor, but that really did not impact on the utility of this camera. I love it and will have it with me from now on. (FYI, buy a second battery and the little nylon case (PTX-L100), which has a little pocket inside for a spare battery, and you are set to go anywhere).Shortcomings: as stated ealier, battery life and flash reach. Also, the camera has problems aquiring correct focus in very low light. On one occasion, the camera \"misbehaved\", it was obviously a software malfunction and fixed itself by using the\"reset to default\" function from the menu.Have fun with it.Hartmut Uschmann", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera!!!", "Author": "Greg Rudi", "ReviewID": "R2FGDLRXH9QYAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchashed this camera for underwater photography for an upcoming cruise.

With the underwater setting, the pictures were so vivid and crisp.  You can use the zoom to get up close with the fish and just shoot away!  The above water pictures also turned out great too!

Thompson", "ReviewID": "R2CL4NKVQ9X6VH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this after dropping a Casio Exilim EXZ55 about 3 feet of the ground. Seams like a tough camera, but afterwards the flash didn't work, then the next day the screen went blank, then it stopped working entirely. luckily I was able to return it... Figured I needed something a little more rugged, and hey waterproof is a HUGE perk!about the Optio WP's performance:This is the area I was unable to find much about, reviews are slim picking online, so I figured id just try it out.picture quality - grainy is the word that comes to mind if you zoom in much. Even with the quality all the way up (***), the pictures are noticably lower quality than the casio.  That being said, for the purpose I purchased the camera (mostly social ocasions) I would most likely shrink the image before sending it out to friends and such, so it doesn't really matter THAT much, but at times I like to get artsy and take really nice photos. (I esp. like taking night shots)  This camera isn't suited for that.  I'll try to post some photos after playing with it a while.It seams quick enoughturns on and off quickly.  There is a slight delay between pressing the button and taking the picture, not huge, but not instant like the exilim. Shot to shot times with flash on (what I really care about) seam very quick at about 4-5 seconds.  thats faster than the exslim and I think thats faster than most cameras.I've really noticed that my memory card is slow with this camera, as it will let you take pictures while its writing to it, but doesn't let you do anything else - can't enter any menu's or turn the flash on or off, whatever, until its done writing the the memory card. This can take 15+ seconds if you fill the buffer!! find this highly anoying as I take lots of photos very quickly at times. So make sure you get a fast memory card, as mine was just the cheapest one I could find...Flash - seams bright enough, need more testing to really know, but its very bright.design - menu system seams pretty nice. the buttons are a little wierd feeling at times, but that probably has to do with the waterproofing.  compairing the size to the casio, this one is a little shorter and about a half a inch longer, but about the same thickness.  Really feels like a cell phone in your pocket.Battery life - lasted longer than I thought it would, and replacement batteries are like $10 with shipping off ebay, but nothing like the exilim... that thing would go FOREVER.  Need to use it more to really get a feel for this as I havn't really used it besides testing it.what has really bothered me is this cameras ability to take night shots.  I tooks some great night shots with the exilim, but this I would rank it a D- as the shots I have taken all look like butt.  The longest shutter time is 4 seconds, so it uses higher iso's to compensate, and defaults to iso200 even if it could use lower. (the exslim used iso50) If you need a tripod anyways, whats the point in limiting the shutterspeed? heck if it has to sit there for 20 seconds to take a nice photo, great, I'll take quality over speed when i'm taking night shots.  speaking of tripods the part it screws in is all the way on the edge of the camera... just seams like the worst place for it.there is no cover for the lens.  sure its hardend glass or something, but If I carry this thing around in my pocket I know it will get scratched up, or at least dirty all the time, the exilim turned on in my pocket a couple times (not good), so at least I don't have to worry about that.So its small, waterproof, and seams faily durable. Its quick, but only if your memory card can keep up. photo quality is not its strong point, but its also not that bad.  It meets my main objective of why I purchased this camera, I just wish I could take excellent photos if I got in a photography mode and wanted to get all artsy.  Knowing me, I probably should stick to something tough and somewhat cheap to carry around, as I tend to break things, but my complaints are problems I really don't see a reason why they have to be there at all.Really if it wasn't for this being waterproof I'd return it right away as I know there are better cameras. But I'll use it a while and see... $300 for a waterproof camera that really isn't half bad AND really small? yes please...  being able to go out in a hurricane and take pictures of crazy stuff without worrying about water is apealing, not to mention taking it to pools or the beach...

I wanted to be able to take pictures while snorkeling and I am also quite clumsy, so I wanted a durable camera. The Pentax Optio exceeded all my expectations. It has survived trips to the beach, pool, camping, hiking, sporting events, Disneyworld, 3 small kids, and 3 dogs! It has been dropped more times than I can count. It looks like it has been in a war zone, yet it still functions perfectly. It can definitely take a beating! This camera had been buried in the sand, ground into the mud, handled by sticky and dirty kids, and left outside exposed to the elements. It still works like a charm. I have taken it snorkeling and into the pool and the pictures are amazing. This camera will do well in any wet climate. I am not a photographer. I am a regular mom who wanted a camera I could take anywhere. This camera fits the bill. All most people need is 4 or 5 megapixels anyway. I have never printed out any picture bigger than 8x10. The picture quality is more than adequate at that size and smaller. I don't even use any of the more complicated features. This camera definitely offers them though if you are into all that stuff. The only drawback, and I mean the ONLY one, is that you can't use the new SDHC cards in this camera. I wanted a larger capacity card and the camera didn't recognize it because it was a HC.This is a good, everyday camera. It is simple to use, very durable, and small enough to fit in your pocket.Seriously, I have had this camera for over 4 years. I use it ALL the time for everything. It is the only camera my family uses. I love it because I never worry about the conditions. If it is wet outside, I can still use it. If it is dirty outside, I can still use it. If the kids get a hold of it and drop it, I can still use it. It has been through the ringer and the pictures are still great. It is a bit costly, but well worth it.

Does it make a difference (I did note the comments in the one review).", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "5 MP CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 13 x 17-inch prints\nWaterproof body enables approximately 30 minutes of continuous underwater shooting at a depth of up to 1.5 meters\n3x optical zoom; recovery function makes it possible to reclaim images and audio files erased accidentally\nLarge, 2.0-inch LCD monitor with low-reflection technology and a backlighting system\nPowered by a long-life rechargeable Lithium-ion battery; stores images on SD memory cards and has approximately 10.5MB of built-in memory", "Name": "Pentax Optio WP 5MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51T7SHT3SRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007CZ6F0"}}
