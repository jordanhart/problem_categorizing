The package was not great - camera bag is for big cameras and film and other junk.  Camera strap with D-Ring (what is that for).  Needs a strap you can put on your wrist and not drop it or loose it when underwater scuba or snorkling.  FYI - battery drains fast when GPS is active.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$314.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Pentax WG-3 Shock & Waterproof GPS Digital Camera (Green) + <2> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card + <3> Spare Li-50B/D-LI92 Battery +\n<4> Vivitar All-in-1 ATV/Bike Kit + <5> PD-C20 Camera/Camcorder Case + <6> PD-T14 Flexible Camera Tripod +\n<7> Floating Foam Camera Strap + <8> HDMI to Micro-HDMI Cable (6') + <9> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<10> LCD Screen Protectors + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Pentax WG-3 Shock & Waterproof GPS Digital Camera (Green) with 32GB Card + Helmet & Handlebar Mounts + Battery + Case + Flex Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61KNIRuVmwL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DJ98WSG"}}
