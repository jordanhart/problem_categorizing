{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superstyle, acceptable substance", "Author": "Thomas Tan", "ReviewID": "R39EL3GOGCETQD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Image quality is just as important to me as the convenience of a p&s;, so when my latest Canon broke due to a lens that no longer retracted, I decided to try Fuji due to the rave reviews I've read about its imaging technology.Putting it through the paces, pictures came out sharp and natural in outdoor conditions, but I was somewhat disappointed with the noise and blurring that still occurred in lower light conditions despite the image stabilisation.  It's a similar fault in my old SD800IS, which I guess is a limitation of ultra-compact cameras generally.  The difference in image quality between the Fuji and Canon was so small, that I think if you've decided to get a p&s; then the Fuji is just as acceptable as any Canon in the same range.  This is where the other features come into importance.Pros:- Non-retracting lens.  This will not break or get stuck like the retracting lens that seems to afflict the Canon SD series so often.  Coupled with Fuji's better customer service and 3yr standard warranty, I felt more comfortable about shelling out $$ for a Fuji than for a Canon.- Sexy design.  I chose the copper-tone, and it's unbelievable how beautiful it is - the Z100fd looks more like a Mont Blanc cigarette box than a camera.  It truly fits in a pocket and is worthy of a home in a Louis Vuitton bag.  Everything from the diagonally sliding lens to the slick metal and curved finishes will turn heads.- Click-wheel is easy to use- Auction mode.  This allows the arrangement of 3 or 4 separate pics into one photo- Takes SD cards- Better photo viewing and management software than Canon SDCons:- Frustrating manual.  I am still trying to figure out how to change the resolution and how to download pics from the different folders in the camera- Grainy, noisy pics in lower light.  I would be happy with a 7MP or even 6MP camera if it means an improved imaging sensor.- Slippery feel- Lens in top corner meant the finger sometimes gets in the way- Battery charger bulkier than Canon SD.  Battery life seemed a little shortOverall - unbeatable looks, does everything you hope in a p&s;, acceptable but obviously not SLR quality.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Buy For The Money!!!", "Author": "Ryan N.

I liked that it had more zoom than the F460.I liked nothing about this camera, other than the pink. The menu is so awkward - when you change a menu setting, it dumps you right back to the view finder, completely out of the menu. Then you have to go back into the menu, scroll scroll scroll to the set up, navigate to another option you want to change, save and get dumped again completely out of the menu setup. Wash, rinse, repeat.I could have lived with that if it took great pictures. It didn't. The pictures SUCKED. Maybe if you looked at it from far away, it looked ok. But zoom in to the full size, and the pictures are completely grainy. I had it on the highest quality setting, I tried using auto, manual, etc - nothing helped. I took identical pictures with this one and my F460, and there was just no comparison. The F460 were clear and sharp, and this one were all muddled and grainy.I'm returning it.

Guest \"Honest John\"", "ReviewID": "R37S1Z4ZSVOHGR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "GREAT low-cost camera .. not an Amazon buy (from an egg-cellent CA company :  .. Bit over $100 ..free: shipping, 2GB SD card and soft case. I've owned it a bit over 6 months. I'm an experienced photographer, but never owned a digital camera before.Perfect? No, for $450-800 get a better one ;) Others in $100 range may be competitive.. I can't say. It compares very favorably to ones my kids have owned that cost much more. This camera was released ~2 yrs ago.Strong Points:1. It works fine as a \"point and shoot\" in most normal situations.. so you don't HAVE to fiddle with a lot of techy details (BUT it has extensive \"manual\" capabilities and many MODES such as backlight etc)2. Superb resolution (approximately 2x HD).. Should easily do an 8x10 photo. Some claim it is \"poor\" in some situations.. this is a misapplication.. usually in low light where they expect the \"anti-shake\" to function as a tripod.. sorry but cameras don't work like that.3. It is EXTREMELY compact.. cigarette pack size and under 5 oz weight. It seems to be well built too.. I haven't babied it. I'm sure water and sand would do it in though4. Also does decent video (up to 640x480 resolution), and will work perfectly well in an \"average\" lighted room.. good for casual filming and \"youtube\" etc.5. It has 5x OPTICAL zoom (to 10x digital zoom) .. this is excellent for a unit that doesn't have a \"snout type\" camera lens that sticks out. Optical beats digital a lot. (Zoom appoximates a 35mm with 36-180mm)6. The LCD seems decently sized and bright to me.. and I don't have very good eyes.. :) It cannot be \"reversed\" to see yourself while taking your own pic.7. Works very well as a \"copy camera\" mounted on a lighted stand to copy documents or family albums, etc.. it has a very nice MACRO focus ability and a \"text\" exposure mode. It should be great for making shots for ebay etc too.8. It has EXTENSIVE manual over-ride and settings options.. In order to use these well you MUST be familiar with the camera and its use (from practice and the manual.. which contrary to others I find competent and pretty thorough .. it isn't a tutorial though)9. It comes with a cord to attach to a VCR (or computer card) and actually makes an ok video camera, though not portable in this mode.. and the viewfinder doesn't power up when you have an external device attached.This is a \"makeshift\" mode and I'd not suggest it for normal use unless you get the \"ac adapter\" for it (IMO bit expensive for a $100 camera) It WILL NOT work on USB power.10. I had no problems transfering pics from the camera to my pc. It can be done by either using the included USB cable or by taking the SD card out and plugging it into a reader on your pc. I've done both and had no problems. It \"just happened\"..I didn't have to do anything to make it work11. It makes decent \"action shots\" too in decent lighting (auto racing etc) with shutter speeds up to 1/1000 sec and down to 4 sec. It doesn't have a \"bulb\" setting that I am aware of.12. It has many \"best of\" scenrios ..1 flash, 1 not: you pick best.. several shots in a row, save last 3: .. \"fast shot\" sequences.. etc.. I'm sure something to suit your fancy is here13. The non-extending lens make this both higher in reliability and more sleek.. but also gives it the higher f-stop restrictions.It does have some negatives (not really \"failings\" .. just things that are worthy of note)1. The lens is in the spot where your left hand normally goes and it takes awareness to keep your finger off the lens since it doesn't \"stick out\".. you would see this onscreen unless you're shooting \"blind\" like over your head.. I found it pretty easy to adjust.2. This is NOT a \"see in the dark\" camera.. I say this not because it suffers in low light (it has up to 1600 ASA which is VERY respectable, but the f3.8 lens is the issue). Low light suggests tripods and timed exposures and people don't typically do that with a \"point and shoot\".. I have used it on a tripod and it works well. I have taken acceptable shots by candlelight if the subject is near the candle.. such as a birthday cake. It is an f3.8 lens.. expensive cameras will be f2.8 or even lower.IF lower light conditions are IMPORTANT to you, I'd suggest GE-E1235 12MP Digital Camera with 3X Optical Zoom (Black) or the slightly older GE E1050TW-BK 10 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Black). They're almost double the price and suffer the \"innie/outtie snout lens\" which I don't much like, but much better for lowlight with lenses around f2.4.3. The software suite that it comes with (for using on your pc) is only ok.. to do any real custom work you will need to buy software, which you likely have anyways if you are doing this kind of work. For color balance, cropping, making slide shows, etc its fine. Picassa is a decent free option.4. The battery is ok, but if you're going to use it for extended video you better get a second one so you can switch out if you need to. I've never had it stop on me, but I am aware of its limits.. In still mode it shouldn't be a problem. It recharges rather quickly.. 2 hours?.. I've not timed it. Careful shopping will yield an equivalent battery or better (ie: 2Pcs Battery+Charger for Fuji NP-45 NP-45A) for a very reasonably price.5. You can put a TON of stuff on even a small SD card.. but the memory it comes with would probably not make most people happy for anything other than around the home where you can dump shots to your pc now and then. SD cards are CHEAP now.. buy one no matter what camera you get!6. There is no way at all to manually focus this unit.. It is true that a wide angle lens makes this less obvious. No matter how good it's auto-focus is even with the \"depress button pre-focus\", many times it just doesn't cut it.. especially if shooting through glass or using the macro capability, etc. Many shots if examined closely just don't have that \"razor sharp\" focus I love. I have no idea how it determines focus... it may be sound or some digital process of \"edges\"Another \"observation\".. neither bad nor good.. it took me a bit of study to figure out how to use the \"screen menus\" to see and sort and change your pics in the camera, but my daughter picked it up and immediately worked it in detail..I'm guessing its pretty standard for digital cameras.. as I said its my first.My only two real criticisms of this unit are the high f-stop rating (the higher the \"f\" rating on a lens, the less light it lets in making for poorer \"low light\" performance) and no ability to manually focus it.In summary.. FOR AVERAGE TO BETTER LIGHTING conditions and MANY 'point and shoot' applications, you can't do better. Plus, its such a feeling of FREEDOM to not have to fool with film and developers!! Excercise that freedom.. USE IT! PLAY WITH IT!! LEARN! :) It is capable, inexpensive, and flexible. It isn't a $600 camera for $100 but its a keeper.

And those can only be shot correctly 99% of the time with a SLR camera with a much larger lens and light throughput.  Anything over 4 megapixel is just ridiculous for a pocket camera.My Nikon D70 SLR will out-shoot at 6mpx any pocket camera at 12.  It's not the pixel count that makes a great camera, it's the circuitry that process the image, draws correct colors and contrast, and can focus on a subject correctly.That said, at overkill 8 megapixel spec, this camera does provide very neutral color renditions, focuses fast, and picks up on what you are trying to accomplish most of the time. (and manual settings can cover the rest of the time)  I think the only pocket cameras on the market that may be superior in the Canon's pocket camera series, but this one's close.

I wasn't very satisfied with my two-year old Olympus because of the poor quality of low light shots, so I bought this one. My boyfriend had a Fuji and it was a great camera, so I decided to give this one a shot.Big mistake!To make it short, here are the few nice things about it:- face identification feature- auction mode (nice feature, at least in theory. If you want to change the format after shooting the first picture(s) you lose the ones you've already taken.)- the possibility to use SD and XD memory cardsNow, this is the longer list, that of the problems I've had with this camera so far (in less than three months of usage, by the way):- low light pictures are very bad unless you use a tripod- it takes too long for the pictures to be saved, so you cannot take one picture short after the other, which can be frustrating when shooting pictures of animals, children or sport- there's no way to turn off the option of having the picture shown after it's taken, so no way to save time before the next shot- manual settings are very poor- the menu is on the display, which seems to be a good idea at first, but it is not! That makes you lose a lot of reactivity. So if you see Tom Hanks (or whoever you might like) and want to make a movie instead of a picture, he'll be gone before you can change it from photo to video mode. A wheel does the job much faster!-  there are all kinds of error messages: \"writing error\", \"lense error\", \"card reading error\", etc. And I get them way too often!- the software that came along with it could not be successfully installed on my computer and the camera won't be recognized as USB drive. As a result, I need to put the card in my old camera to be able to upload the pictures to my computer.- the lense got dirty from the inside, don't ask me how!
