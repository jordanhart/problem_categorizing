{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good camera", "Author": "Gadgeteer", "ReviewID": "R1W4O6A6D8YLNN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera basically based on the review in Engadget of point and shoot cameras. I was replacing a broken Canon TX1 that I had used primarily for 720P video shooting.Video recording was very important.Size was also very important and we were looking at the Canon SD780 IS. My main camera is a Canon Rebel XTi.Overall I have found this camera to be very good.+ Takes very good pictures overall+ Very easy to use+ Camera has nice smart modes. The kids mode is especially good for me+ The video quality is great. You can zoom in while shooting video. You cannot do this on the Canon SD780+ charges via the camera (no need to take out the battery).- Flash recycling is relatively slow. It's not the world's fastest camera overall.- The camera is a little heavy. Definitely bigger than the SD780- Strange proprietary cable (does not use mini USB, etc.)- Comes with no software- Comes with no printed manual (just a quick start guide)Note on VideoVideo is shot in MP4 (h.264) format. This makes the videos pretty small, but its hard to work with on a Windows PC. I think Windows 7 will make this work better, but for now it is a problem. My old Canon TX1 shot in MJPEG. This produces bigger files, but it is very easy to work with. The Canon SD780 also uses MP4 as do many other newer cameras (Flip Mino, etc.).I use Picasa to organize my photos. Picasa would stutter through most of the MP4 videos. I had problems viewing the files in Quicktime as well (on an AMD X2 5000). The videos play fine on the Zune software an also on an Xbox 360.OverallI recommend this camera. I was thinking about getting a Flip Mino HD or a Creative Labs Vado. Frankly, I don't see why you would buy a cheap HD camera when you can get this much better camera for not much more. If you need something a little smaller the Canon SD780. But overall, I think the Samsung offers more features in a bigger package for about the same price.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Capable camera, but durability and service spotty", "Author": "Pat Furrie", "ReviewID": "R2S6L7VVNO7CJZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: nice pictures, high-def (720p) video mode, light weight, quick start-up time, wider-than-normal lens with 5X optical zoom.Cons: Questions on durability (see below), warranty service doesn't cover shipping to repair center, sound stops recording when using zoom.Purchased as a graduation gift, and was well-received.  Worked well for recording video of graduation ceremony, and video quality of ceremony looked good.  However, it was annoying that the audio in the recording cuts out when using the zoom.  Would be interested in learning if that is on purpose, perhaps to prevent picking up zoom motor noise, or just an artifact of limitations on the camera not being able to perform too many things at one time.  Whatever the reason, it limits what can be done in that mode.Later that evening, found that the lens didn't retract when the camera was shut off one time.  Normally, like most cameras of this type, the lens extends when the camera is powered on, and retracts when the camera is powered down.  I just figured the camera was very low on power (which it was), and had failed for that reason.  Later, when we attempted to turn the camera back on, we could hear a whirring noise in the camera for a few moments, and then nothing.  I assumed the noise was the lens motor attemnpting to either close or open the lens, but being unsuccessful.  At the point, the camera would shut down.  No amount of coaxing would convince the stubborn lens to behave.A call to Samsung tech support turned up no solutions to the lens problem.  They emailed me an RMA and a shipping address for the repair center, but didn't cover the shipping costs.  Repairs took a bit over a week.UPDATE: After having the repaired camera back for only three days, the same issue surfaced again -- lens won't retract, only a whirring noise, a beep, and then it shuts off.  Going to Samsung's site allows me to re-enter a service request, but it expects me to pay another $8 to ship it in for another \"repair.\"", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pretty Darn Close...", "Author": "Dayna Reynoldson", "ReviewID": "R32FKLHZWUXYAT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was hoping this would be the camera that I needed, and it comes pretty darn close.  The main reason I purchased this camera was for the hd video capabilities.  I enjoy taking quick little videos of my girls, and being able to upload them quickly for my family and friends to share.  This camera lives up to that challenge quite nicely, although beware that when you take advantage of the 5X zoom, the sound cuts out until you are zoomed where you want, then cuts back in.  A minor little annoyance.  The picture quality of this camera is very good.  I really have not taken a bad picture yet, which is quite remarkable!  This is my 6th purse camera to date, and I would have to say the quality is right up there with some of the best cameras I have owned.  The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is due to the cameras performance speed.  Shot to shot is quite slow for a camera in this class.  You have to wait for the flash to re-power before taking the next shot, which at times I found to be extremely annoying.  Also the zoom controller is in an awkward position, and would not always zoom when pushed.  Samsung has to work out a few bugs before getting this camera perfect! But I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a compact camera with all the features!", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this camera!", "Author": "J.

Got it somewhere for $265 that includes shipping and tax in California. It is a little heavy than most compact. Nice brushed metal frame and quality is really good.  The pictures are great. I  played the videos directly from camera to TV and it's very clear and full screen with my analog 32\" TV. However, like the other reviewer, it doesn't come with complete manual and video is MP4.It came with a CD but I haven't open it yet. I like the smile shot, the Beauty shot (makes your skin smooth and perfect!) and multiple shots, which is available on P mode only, and Dual OIS (Anti-shake). It doesn't come with a leather case or a memory card so invest on those too though. I use an 8gb SD card.

Images are crisp and clear in light or dark.  I havent messed around with editing the videos, however they do turn out nice.

Shah \"Tech Junky\"", "ReviewID": "R1XYIGO038QO0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I had lost my old Samsung NV camera. I love Samsung cameras, they have crisp color and image quality is amazing. Plus the look really hot. My girlfriend has a Nikon, and my parents have a Canon and I'd have to say this Samsung's pictures put them both to shame. My only real complaint about this camera is that the DIS (Dual Image Stabilization) is not that great. It comes standard in almost all their cameras, so I know it's not something I spent an extra penny on, but still. Besides that the screen on the back is gorgeous, it's easy to use. Picture quality is great and the video quality is amazing. But its not just the video, it's also the audio in the videos. It's awesome, especially for a digi still cam. It's a LITTLE on the thicker side (only a little though), it'll easily fit in a guys pocket. But ladies, you might need to carry one of those huge totes for this. It lags a little sometimes between pictures which is expected really and when you zoom during videos it cuts of audio while you're zooming (I guess to cut out motor noise?). All in all, this camera quality is amongst the best and it's priced very well in comparison. I haven't tested all the modes yet, but the Auto and Smart both work very well. The video, as I said, is amazing. Portrait is pretty good, though I sort of need to take it out on a real test run.

You kind of need to know which setting work best in which situations if you use it in any other mode than Smart.  For all the options you have I think it is pretty simple to use.  Picture quality is really nice, especially if you know how to use it in the different modes.  My only real complaint is that there is very little internal memory.  I have my camera set to take the very best pictures so that may contribute to available memory, but with that said, you will most likely need a SD card.

No hope of returning it now.I bought this camera after reading a bunch of reviews online. I would agree that it's pretty easy to use, it's heavier than other models but not too heavy, it has a decent zoom, and it does in fact have all of the features it advertises.Here's the problem: The picture and video quality is terrible. I'm not a photo snob by any means - I've used DSLRs in the past, but I'm just as happy with the pictures my iPhone takes.This camera takes fuzzier, grainer pictures than my cell phone does. It's better in very bright natural light, but if your subject is standing in a shadow or it's starting to get dusky out, forget about getting a clear shot.I've tried everything--cleaning the lens (obviously), tinkering with all of the settings, restoring default factory settings. No luck. The best performance I get (and this is inconsistent) is in Smart Mode.Bottom line: While this camera technically does take pictures, they're not worth the money and trial and error time it takes to get a decent shot. True, I may have gotten stuck with a lemon, but I'm not so sure. I know people who are very happy with Sony Elph, the Canon Powershot, and some Nikon point-and-shoot (can't remember the model). If you're going to spend the money, I would suggest checking out one of those options instead of this guy.(And if anybody has any great ideas for how to somehow replace or return this baby after the warranty is up, I'd love to hear them!)", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lasted maybe 6 months.", "Author": "Duane Morin", "ReviewID": "R2XR90Q6I78ACW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife for Christmas, mostly for the good resolution and features like \"smart mode\".  First off, most of the modes end up making the picture taking so slow that you have to plan your pictures well in advance.  Ironic, really, when you've got modes like \"children playing\".  Yes, the quality of the picture you get in that mode is very good - but it's usually the back of someone's head because it took several seconds longer than you thought to capture the picture.  The \"beauty shot\" mode is very good, because by definition you've got someone who is standing still for you for several seconds to get a posed picture.But that's not my biggest concern, I could live with that. Barely.  The problem is that 6 months into ownership, the viewfinder started developing spots. I know they are on the finder and not the lens because they do not appear on the pictures. They became more numerous to the point where they interfered with being able to see my pictures.  And now, spots have appeared on the lens as well that no amount of cleaning will fix. So the pictures are basically ruined.Samsung support tells me I can get a warranty repair, but when I go to register the camera I discover that the serial number sticker on the bottom of the camera has rubbed off several digits and now I cannot register (support also tells me I must have a valid serial number to register, this is the only way).  So I guess I have to pay for repairs?  The only service center for this camera - I am in Massachusetts, mind you - is in New Jersey.  So I have to ship my camera away just to find out whether it can be fixed, on my nickel.I don't think I'll be getting a Samsung digital camera of any sort again.

I got this camera May 18th this year to replace my last camera, which was also an SL820 (The lens got stuck after doing a video outside while it was snowing)(It died on March 2nd this year). I have taken alot of pictures and videos with it. In July, the lens started having a hard time coming out. It would come out halfway and go back in, so I would carefully pull the lens out when I was turning my camera on. On August 17th, the lens stopped moving period. They were completely stuck!I had the lower-end SL620 Samsung 12MP Dig Camera 5X Opt 3.0IN LCD Red last year for 6 months (I used it mostly in the Summer).

One time, my cat knocked my laptop on top of my camera in September and it had a dent on the top and it survived until a month later when the pictures started coming out pink and screwed up.I had taken a lot better care of my current SL820 and never taken it outside when it rained and yet the stupid camera still dies on me after having it for only 3 months. I thought that my camera would make it past Christmas this year the way I was taking care of it. I always kept it in its case. By the way, WD-40 does NOT work!

I have a Samsung 52\" LCD HD TV that I am so happy about and love a lot. The price was much less than the competition from Sony or Mitsubishi on the TV I felt like I got a real value and thought I would trust Samsung again because I knew what they are capable of.The SL620 is a nice form factor, fits in my pocket and comes out ready for action quickly. It has the 12.2 Megapixels and 5x zoom, really astonishing technical achievements in a great package.There are some things that I do not like about this camera that might have been deal breakers had I known about it before my purchase.I really do not like the proprietary USB port and cable. Every time I go to hook this up to charge it or download the mini-hdmi (what it looks like) connector does not want to connect. It is hard to see whether it is up or down because it is so small. This is really irritating, and I am sure would be expensive if I ever lost or damaged the cable. A big thumbs down for that. I have gotten used to a standard mini-USB cable, but Samsung uses this one port for download, charging, and displaying to TV as well which probably saves money and parts - for them, but it does nothing to make the camera easier or better to use.Second thing is that I love the on-screen help, but when you flick between modes the text is on the screen not even fast enough to read - and I'm a pretty fast reader - very frustrating. You have to keep clicking away and back to read the help screens? Maybe there is a setting to adjust this, but learning the camera becomes harder, and when they do not implement the help well, it is worse than no help at all because it is just a distraction. Otherwise the menus are laid out pretty well and logically.Next is the viewfinder. I have found that I have to be very conservative, ie. move back and try to give extra margin around my subject to shoot because what I see on the viewfinder is not necessarily the picture I end up with. I have not really analyzed this to find out exactly where the picture is or how it changes with modes, but one needs to see on the viewscreen exactly what the picture is, otherwise the viewscreen is useless too.I wish I could post some video I shot on this camera, the subject is off to the top of the frame, and even cut off. When I was shooting it it was all in the center of the viewscreen. This is a major problem ... I wish I could take it back at this point.The pictures are so huge that taking the picture seems to take a while before the camera comes back. The \"snappiness\" of the response leaves a bit to be desired.I also do not like the way the zoom is implemented as a vertical rocker switch up near the top of the trigger. Your thumb wants to move right and left if you hold the camera like a normal human being, and making it go up and down really makes the zoom clumsy to use, and makes the camera more likely to shake.As I said, I like the form factor, the detail is wonderful, the size and shape are great. The picture quality is very good. The screen help idea is great, and the text that comes up when you change modes is a good idea, but as I said you can hardly read it before it goes away leaving it just as hard to tell what mode you are in as the cameras that have no such help.I have to say I am disappointed overall in the design details of this camera, though all the parts are there and the picture is nice and very detailed an the zoom power is very good.The video is sharp and clear and very nice. I cannot say for sure but I think the image is stabilized in the video.I would recommend this camera for those who want all the features of a 12 MP 5x optical zoom for an inexpensive price and do not mind overlooking some ... what I think of anyway ... as bad design judgements.
