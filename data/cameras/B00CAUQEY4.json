This bundle comes with the 64 GB card (which is great).  The flash is a full-swivel (in all-directions) Precision-brand flash.  The tripod is Precision-brand also and is of good quality (it is not full-featured, but it's very sturdy and does the job). Someone purchasing these components as a starter kit for a DSLR will not be disappointed.  I never got the impression (as I read on other reviews from other vendors' bundles) that any of these accessories were just thrown in.  All the accessories are of \"good\" to \"very good\" quality from what I can tell.I definitely recommend this T5i / 18-135mm bundle.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, poor case - make sure you really need all the additional items.

Agree that the case is a very poor one. Will have to buy a new one separately. I think it is much better to buy the camera and lens and then all the other you REALLY need separately as I am not sure I will use the other things (but had to pay for them and they are not with the best quality....).", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just get the camera.", "Author": "J", "ReviewID": "R61V132C01K6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent camera and lens. The filters and flash and other smaller accessories appear to work well enough. However, the tripod and the camera case are very low quality. The tripod might be useful as a secondary or to use for some other piece of equipment, but I'm not going to depend on it for my expensive camera. The case is very poor and arrived with a broken zipper. Were I to do over again, I'd buy the camera and lens and buy the accessories separately, as needed.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,029.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 13 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <3> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +\n<4> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <5> Precision Design 67mm (UV/CPL/ND8) Filters + <6> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\n<7> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <8> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <9> Precision Design 58\" Tripod +\n<10> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <11> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <12> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <13> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with 64GB Card + Battery + Case + Flash + 3 UV/CPL/ND8 Filters + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dkKbl05iL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAUQEY4"}}
