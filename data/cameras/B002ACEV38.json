It was the best overall deal I could find for the money.  She loves it and is taking great pictures of our family.  Everything works well and is easy to use.  The only additions I would recommend are an extra high speed sd card and a telephoto lens.  they both come in very handy.  Highly recommend.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera kit!", "Author": "evie23", "ReviewID": "RI44WFTAWF0K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i bought this kit for my fiance and she loved it! its comes with everything you need! only thing is the lens it comes with is not meant for distance shots and of course you would prolly wanna purchase a separate flash. but it takes great pics on its own. and this is a really great price for a whole kit!", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "the best ever", "Author": "eko", "ReviewID": "R1Q1R9KKLQK435", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love my new camera the picture quality is greati love taking pictures of my kids,this camera is the best thing i bought in a while thank you,and also the product shipped quick.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome starter DSLR", "Author": "angel7erin", "ReviewID": "R2MOR6ERADFNOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR camera and I have to say it is blowing me away! Of course the stock lens isn't the greatest, but it takes pretty good pictures. This kit is definately worth the money and is the best price around (in-store and online), believe me, I did a lot of research. It came in sooner than they said and in perfect condition. NOTE: To those excited about the RAW picture capability, make sure you have software that you can use to manipulate it, normal picture editing software will sometimes not be able to even view the RAW format.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is one great camera!", "Author": "JFan", "ReviewID": "R3FY8Z3QBSVSAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really happy with the purchase of this camera!  It was rated a 'Best Buy' with Consumer Reports and offers everything that even a semi-pro photographer might want or need.  I was looking for an above-average digital camera to be able to take my own photos for our company's web site.  I figured I might have to pay the same price or more for a professional to take them.  This way I could set my own time-frame for shooting with no appointments to meet and now I have the camera to boot!  The company building our web site was quite impressed by the quality of our photos, too.  This purchase was a good decision for us.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Incredible Camera", "Author": "Mountain_Man", "ReviewID": "R2TI0DFDKJHMK4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love it.
