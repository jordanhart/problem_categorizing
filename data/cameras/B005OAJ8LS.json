The day time color is a little off and the nightime views are ok in the center of the pictures.  For 8 channels and 8 cameras this is really nice little package to keep an eye on your property.  Again for the price impressed on the setup and the fact that you receive everything you need to setup the system.  The multiple outlet power set is really nice, only two power outlets needed.  With a two story house the cable lengths actually made it to all the points except two so not a bad deal.  Overall again the price is the key here so to see if anything is going on and be able to capture at least enough to get a basic description of the individual or vehicle that might be causing issues it works good.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Notice: the camera will instead with color white without notice if the color black is out of stock\nTwo Type Video Out: TV Monitor BNC Output and PC Monitor VGA Output\nVideo Input / Output: BNC 8 / BNC 2; Audio Input / Output: RCA 4 / RCA 2\nRemote Access: Internet Explorer or Netviewer Software\nSupport Remote View via Smart Phone & 3G Mobile", "Name": "ZMODO PKD-DK0865-500GB-Pro Complete 8 Channel H.264 DVR Kit with 8 Weatherproof Cameras 500GB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YfB3wJgUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005OAJ8LS"}}
