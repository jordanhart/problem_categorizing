They may be good in an emergency for the last couple shots of the day.  Don't depend on them for a full day's shooting.  I bought these to get the 12 volt charger and figured I'd need extra batteries also.  I guess I've wasted at least $20 and now I'll have to buy a REAL Pansonic battery that will hold up to a full shooting day.  Not at all pleased with these.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "batteries dont hold a charge", "Author": "A nerd", "ReviewID": "R16DGRO8ELKEKR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "These batteries work great (if you use them right away.)They passively discharge very quickly.
