{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera failure", "Author": "hobbiesrus", "ReviewID": "R34SKYCHZEXZAP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off, the idea of this DVR security combo is fantastic. I loved having the monitor and dvr as one unit. However, after three weeks of use, a burning smell and 2 camera failures forced me to return the unit. I dont know if it was just this unit that was defective or if this is a widespread problem with these combo dvr's. Just check around to see if anyone else has been reporting similar problems. It's very time consuming to layout, set up, and configure your system just to take it down and return it after a few weeks of use. Good luck.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$849.99", "Features": "View your footage from anywhere in the world Online or on a iPhone or BlackBerry Smartphone\nThis all-in-one system has the DVR built into a stylish 19\" LCD monitor, allowing you to save space\nThe included 500GB Hard Drive allows you to record over a month of real-time footage\nThis system supports up to eight cameras so as your monitoring needs grow so can your security system\nLet the helpful iCoaching menu teach you the different features available with this system\nSpace-Saving Design Includes A Built-In Dvr, 9-Inch Lcd Monitor & 4 High-Resolution Indoor/Outdoor Cameras\nH.254 Video Compression Allows Recording Of More Than A Month Of Footage\n500 Gb Hard Drive Stores Over A Month Of Real-Time Footage\nAdvanced Motion-Activated Recording With Multiple Automatic Or Continuous Recording Combinations & Schedules\nCompatible For Online, Iphone Or Blackberry Smartphone Viewing", "Name": "Defender Sync 19 Inch LCD All-In-One Security System with 4 Hi-Res Indoor/Outdoor Surveillance Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nfoMVHFSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Y73Q52"}}
