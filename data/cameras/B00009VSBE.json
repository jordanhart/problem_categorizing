It compares to the top of the line Nikon Coolpix and Olympus high end digicams costing $800-1,000.  But it outshoots all its competitors even though the others cost a lot more $$.  I have been shooting this camera for only 3 days now (it was just released for sale last week) and I love it. My husband loves it and is thinking of buying one for himself even though he owns 3 digital SLR cameras and numerous 35mm Nikons. The photos from the S5000 look fantastic even at the 1mb and 3mb sizes. The lens is really sharp and the 10X zoom allows one to compose just about any photo one can envision. The camera fits nicely in the hand, buttons are intuitive and easy to reach, and one can shoot pics one-handed. It is a much smaller camera than it appears from photos, it is shorter than my cricket lighter!  It has a short lag time between pressing the shutter and making the image, as ALL digicams do, but I get around that by using the \"best of 5\" mode...it can blaze off 5 pics in one second, capturing precious fleeting expressions of my 3 month old son that other cameras would miss. White balance is terrific, skin tones look very realistic to life, metering is right on with what a pro photog would select.  You won't regret owning this truly awesome camera. I'm loving it so much I'm ordering a second xd card to take even more pics.

This camera is truly about the zoom, all 10x of it!  I can easily zoom in on the blue jays in my neighbors trees and when looking at the photo you would think I was right next to them instead of in the next yard over.  I have heard complaints that photos others have taken with the zoom fully extended have turned out very blurry.  I have never experienced any blurriness with this zoom lens at all.  The zoom on this camera is amazing!  Another plus about the s5000 is the styling, it has the look and feel of a traditional SLR which helps traditional 35mm camera users feel comfortable using this camera.  Also the setup is extremely easy.  I had the camera out of the box and operating within 5 minutes the day it arrived. Even though this camera has many advanced features such as manual focus, white balance and ISO controls the beginning user won't have any problem operating it, the camera is fairly self-explanatory in that sense.  One nice feature is the camera's AF illuminator which makes taking indoor shots without the flash very simple and they are usually in focus.  Another great feature is the cameras ability to operate in three color modes:  Black and white (which turns out awesome pics), standard color (usually looks exactly like the real thing), and chrome mode (which simulates slide film and makes the photo much more rich in color).  This camera is almost a 5 star, but I just couldn't rate it a 5 star because of a couple problems.  Most of the time when I am taking pictures against a brightly lit background (whether artificial or a bright sky) there is a noticable purple fringing on the photos.  It is not immediately noticable, but once I noticed it I was not happy with the photos until I edited out the purple in Photoshop. One should also consider purchasing a 256 xd card because of the wealth of photos you will be taking.  On the cameras highest resolution (\"6\" MP) I can fit close to 200 pics on a 256 card.  One other problem I have with the camera is more in the way Fuji marks the camera.  On the side in large print is \"22x zoom\" and this is simply not true.  The camera has 10x zoom with 2.2x digital zoom, and everybody knows that digital zoom doesn't count because of the way it can butcher the quality of the picture.  Also Fuji tends to say that this is a 6MP camera which is also not true.  This is a 3 MP camera with the sensor ability to capture the image as if it were 6MP, the difference is huge and many people could be fooled into thinking that they were purchasing 6MP cameras which is simply not true.  I would recommend this camera to anyone, beginner or professional simply for its wealth of features and its value.  When the camera was originally introduced in the summer of '03 it retailed for close to $600, I have now found it brand new online at several sites for $277, so I would also recommend shopping around before purchasing the camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "value and functionality", "Author": "tamu", "ReviewID": "R3EMJY1Z7MCLU1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Strengths:price!

So I paid $469, but have been using it since early August. All my photos have been excellent, for color and sharpness. I have printed my digital images on Silver halide (AgX) paper and have been impressed with the quality. I have prints as large as 12x18 and see no digital artifacts. While some reviews say that the compression is too much I would disagree. The file sizes are around 800kb and easy to work with and don't over use your hard disk. Don't get caught up in the mega pixel wars, I find a 3MP camera will be enough for your printing needs. I am a research technician in digital imaging and have put the camera through several test for sharpness, grain (noise), and color. So far I can find no fault with this camera for the price range and its features. Another positive feature is its use of power supply, 4 AA batteries. If you are ever in a pinch these can be purchased any where. Battery life is very good, I use the electronic view finder. This takes a little getting use to, but really is fine after using the camera for a short period. If there is one thing that would have been a nice feature would be automatic pop up of the flash when it is needed. Using the camera in Program mode makes it easy for anyone in the family to use, yet the camera has features for the more serious photographer. So if you want a camera with 10x optical zoom, easy to use, no special battery, and the new xD camera card this is a great buy. The xD card really is faster than the compact flash cards so widely used. And if you buy the xD to compact flash adapter you can use the xD card in other compact flash equipment.

I love that it actually LOOKS like a real camera, and it performs better than any camera I've ever had.  I've owned mine since the end of February and have taken hundreds of photos that have turned out outstanding.  Everyone who sees them marvels at the quality, clarity, and color accuracy--not to mention the fact that I can get a GREAT picture of a goal shot from the OTHER END of a soccer field.  By the way, all of those pictures I took that people loved--those are all with only 2MPMy FAVORITE features of the S5000:  *10x optical zoom allows for EXCELLENT composition (ignore digital zoom though. It diminishes photo quality)  *First-5 and Last-5 modes, when teamed with Aperture Priority at 1/1000 or so, allows me to get the PERFECT shots at sports matches and anything else that might otherwise be missed.  THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST FEATURE OF THIS CAMERA!  I RELY ON IT FOR *ANYTHING* THAT I KNOW I WANT TO CAPTURE, FROM WAVES CRASHING ON THE REEF TO A DROP KICK BY OUR TEAM'S GOALIE.  *It is VERY EASY to use!  As soon as I got it, I was experimenting with the camera in less than 10 minutes.  *Battery consumption is quite respectable, especially for this type of camera.  I use 4x2100 NiMH AA's (I love that it uses AA's) which last easily for hours of taking 5 or 10 shots in a row every couple minutes at sporting events.  I use the flash ALOT, and it doesn't wear too much on the batteries either. (Just watch out for the batteries it comes with... they lasted about an hour after I first got the camera.)  *XD card is great! It's REALLY fast and easy to use.  *Oh yea... finally, THE PRICE !ROCKS! FOR WHAT YOU GET!!!Unfortunately, all cameras have their cons:  *With the GREAT zoom the S5000 has, keeping it steady without a tripod becomes a challenge.  Steadying software would have been a great boon, but it had to be cut for cutting cost and size.  *I !DO NOT! like the electronic viewfinder.  It's hard to use, lags more than the LCD, and is less sharp.  The S5000 should have had a standard viewfinder.  I'd use it alot more and even save batteries from not using the LCD.  *The so-called \"manual focus\" is a joke.  I've found it impossible to operate.PLEASE!!! Don't let my gripes take away from this EXCELLENT camera! Things could always be a little easier or better, but with a camera at this price, of such high quality, and has SO MANY CAPABILITIES, you can't turn this one down!!!Last tips for use:  *You NEED a larger memory card.  At a minimum, 64MB.  I recommend 128MB, though I have a 256MB card.  It works GREAT and holds over 400 shots at 2MP, or 325 shots at 3MP.  With a camera this much fun to use, you NEED space to play with.  *GET RECHARGABLE NimH AA batteries!!! You can't go for even an afternoon without rechargables.  I recommend at least 1800-2100 capacities.  *FINALLY: HAVE FUN!!! THIS CAMERA HAS !ALOT! TO OFFER, SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS CAPABILITIES! READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL!

Bicoy \"bicoy\"", "ReviewID": "R2ID63283ITYJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing our first digital cameras, my wife and I did a heck of a lot of homework.  We finally settled on the Fujifilm A205 for my wife to carry around in her purse, and the Fujifilm FinePix S5000 for me -- as I am a bit more serious about photography.I wanted something that gave me the feel and many of the features of an SLR, but I didn't actually want to deal with either the price or bother of an SLR.  After doing about a month of research, I purchased the FinePix S5000 and it is the perfect solution.If you read the other reviews, you'll learn about many of the terrific features of this fine camera, but I'll mention a feature I didn't really realize until I brought it home and played with it for a few weeks.The adapter ring that forms the barrel around the lens allows me to use professional filters.  It tells you that right there in the manual that you can use one filter with the adapter ring, but it's buried under all sorts of other technical information.  I'm surprised that Fujifilm doesn't do more to promote this fact because this is a HUGE asset.  The only reason I can think of as to why they don't is because there are so many incredible features of this terrific camera.As for filters, I've since purchased four different ones -- all size 55mm to fit the adapter.  The general use UV filter (mostly for protection) and a Polarizer (to lessen glare on sunny days) were a great place to start.  I also purchased two other filters to compensate for indoor light.  The flash on the S5000 isn't particularly strong, so it doesn't work all that well from more than 15 or 20 feet away.  This is important because if you're in a school auditorium (remember, I have 6 kids -- so I'm there often) with fluorescent lights overhead, the pictures can turn out slightly green if taken from a distance.  This does not happen when up close because the flash overwhelms the ambient flourescent light.  But when my kids are on stage, for instance, they turn slightly greenish.  This is no fault of the S5000 -- it's simply a characteristic of any camera taking pictures under most household or office light.  It happened on the time with our old camera.I bought an FL-D filter which dramatically lessens greenish effect from fluorescent light.  I also have an 80A filter that compensates for the same problem that comes when taking pictures from a distance under traditional home-type incandescent light bulbs.I imagine you can use any brand you want, but each of my four filters is a Tiffen and can be bought online or from many camera stores for about $10 to $15 a piece.  This makes the S5000 truly unique.  I have not found another point and shoot (non-SLR) camera that has this capacity to use professional filters.  You can't use more than one filter at a time, but I'm so tickled that we can use any at all that this is a small issue of concern.If you're really ambitious, there all all kinds of filters that do everything from soften a picture to create really neat special effects (like starbursts with every point of light).  This brings an amazing flexibility to the S5000.I also bought a Fujifilm TL-FX9 1.5x telephoto lens which I can attach to the adapter ring, effectively raising my optical zoom from 10x to 15x.  This is a nice feature, but the 10x standard optical zoom is such a monster zoom that I rarely use the additional 1.5x telephoto lens except when I'm watching my kids on stage from the audience or something like that.As noted in other reviews, ignore the 2.2x digital zoom, because you'll probably never use it.  It is disabled when you're shooting at 6 megapixels (if you're confused about the 3.1 mp versus 6.1 mp, read the descriptions about the amazing Super CCD) so I never am able to use the 2.2x digital zoom anyway.  But unless you've had a telephoto lens on your old camera, the 10x zoom will overwhelm you for most purposes anyway.  And if you really need more, buy the TL-FX9 telephoto lens that turns your optical zoom to 15x.  I purchased my TL-FX9 through an outside vendor at Amazon and it worked out great.One last thing, don't forget to invest in a good printer.  All this camera technology means nothing if your printer doesn't do its job.  I bought the Canon i960 at the same time as my camera and couldn't be happier with it when using the Canon Pro paper.  The prints are amazing and truly duplicate the quality of processing you get in most neighborhood retail stores where most film is developed.If you're a serious amateur who doesn't want to break the bank, I highly recommend the Fujifilm S5000.

Minkin \"maxintosh\"", "ReviewID": "R1CPRM33OK8XZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is one of the best hidden secrets of the mid-range/amateur digital camera market. It is about as close to a dSLR as you can get without breaking the bank. For one, the camera fits your hand like a glove, with its huge beefy handgrip and thoughtfully placed controls. The 10x optical zoom is stunning. Battery life is amazing, I go for weeks on a pair of 1800mAh rechargeables. Color and exposure are spot on, AF is dead-on accurate and the AF assist lamp is a rarely-found but valuable feature in this market segment. Shot-to-shot time is practically instantaneous. The S5000 can scale from a novice-friendly point-and-shoot to a killer amateur photographer's camera. I have only few quams about this camera. For one, the software that compresses the JPEGs is too aggressive. Images show noise when viewed 1:1, but this isn't a problem unless you're printing photos larger than 8x10; if you are the CCD-RAW mode produces flawless images that can be post-processed on your own. Prints from the 3 MP mode look spectacular when printed in non-enlargement sizes. Next, I would make the LCD bigger, although it is incredibly bright and pretty high-resolution. The EVF needs to have a higher resolution, but it's better than the optical viewfinder found on pretty much every other camera in the market. In all, I strongly reccomend this camera. The professional reviews that I've read tend to put this camera up against cameras that cost it twice as much; that's actually rather flattering for the S5000.

There were certainly cheaper cameras out there, and more sophisticated ones, but the s5000 seemed to be a good balance of costs vs. features, and I didn't want to lay down a great deal of money, until I had figured out from use which features were important (Start up time, for example, was something I had never considered before).I wanted something \"SLR-like\" if not actually an SLR, because that is what I am used to working with normally. Strictly speaking, the s5000 is not an SLR, because the is no mirror and no reflex, you may not get the \"real life\" image of an actual SLR, but there is also no mirror shake or screen blackout.Of course, immediately after I bought this proces tumbled and the higher end digital SLRs are now affordable, but that's the way it always goes. If yo want a camera that is cheap, reliable, makes good pictures, and is a good gateway to the top level digital SLRs, then this is probably the type of camera that you want.On an odd note, I find that when I use it at public events like parades, particularly with the wide angle lens adaptor, people occasionally ask me if I am from the newspaper. I guess the camera looks more pro than it really is.Also, It survived a drop from about 12 inches onto hard tile, with no damage. That's not too bad for a cheap plastic body.It has a number of strengths:The 10x optical zoom is extremely long. (this is really a huge plus)Lens quality is good.Absolutely quiet.Continuous drive features are good, allows a decent (5 frame) series of consecutive pics.Lightweight.Nice sharp macros.Uses standard AA batteries (this is important in the field!)Batteries on full charge last a long time. I find around 400 shots.Remarkably good resolution for 3.2 MP- punches above its weight.Weaknesses:Storage media is way overpriced.Mode selector dial switches unintentionally.Long start up time.Body is plastic and a little frail. (not too bad though).Manual focus is not actually possible in real life.Viewfinder image quality is nto so great.The 6MP setting is, for lack of a better word, fraudulent.  The camera creates a larger file through interpolation, but the 6MP image is actually of worse resolution than 3 MP image.  I discovered this the first trip I shot, when I got home to PS the images.STRONGEST DRAWBACK!!- almost constant vignetting, this is often fixable in photoshop, but I don't know how the designers let it go to market with that problem.Overall I would recommend it as a good intro to digital, especially at the prices it currently commands.

I was very reluctant to go digital - I liked the reliability of film camera (ie no pictures getting lost on a hard drive or facing technical difficulties trying to figure out how to use it) as well as the quality of the images, so it was going to take a really good camera to convince me that it was worth it.I selected the S5000 for a few key reasons:  it got very good reviews from serious photographers as to the the quality of the images (which are totally justified), it was very intuitive to use (my 7 year old figured it out in about 2 minutes and loves taking and viewing pictures on it), it is very light and easy to handle, and it takes AA batteries (a lifesaver - extras are always available anywhere, and money-saver since I use rechargeables).  An added benefit was the 10x zoom which has been amazing at my daughter's soccer & softball games and other outdoor school events - it is the envy of the parental paparazzi along the sidelines at her games.This camera has surpassed my expectations in every area, prodcucing clear and reliably superb pictures in a variety of conditions.  I have avoided the shutter-lag issue which turned me off to many digital cameras by using the feature which allows you to depress the shutter button halfway to focus, and then pause to wait for the perfect moment with almost no lag time when you ultimately depress the shutter the rest of the way.  Self timer, black & white mode, and rapid shooting (which takes up to 5 picutres in rapid succession) are all very easy to use.  I must say that I have not used the Manual Mode at all, even though that was an important feature to me in selecting a camera.  I hope to master that mode soon, but when you're running around trying to get shots of active kids you are very grateful for the outstanding Automatic Mode!I did upgrade to a larger memory card - 128 mB.  I can take up to about 140 pictures on it, and combined with the 30 or so I can get on the card that came with it I have plenty of room to store all my picutres from a 1 week vacation.Printed pictures come out wonderfully.  I print all my pictures at Costco because they are printed using the same machine as film pictures, therefore alleviating my concern that pictures printed with printer ink and paper will not withstand the test of time.  Plus at $.19 per picture it is way cheaper than buying photo paper and photo quality ink, not to mention a time saver (I take a lot of pictures!). I also feel that the quality of the pictures, particularly the color, is better than some of the online printers like Shutterfly.I have never loved a camera as much as I have do this one, and I only realized this when I thought I had lost it a week ago.  Debating whether this was my chance to finally upgrade to a SLR like the Nikon D70, I realized that the S5000 was the perfect camera for me and that I would be a fool to not replace it with the same thing.  Lucky for me I found it (at the bottom of my kids' closet - don't ask me how it got there).  So the story has a happy ending, and I am contentedly back to taking pictures with my S5000.", "Date": "November 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Please read.

Finally won a gift certificate at work and treated myself to this camera.  Am I glad I did!!I am just an average person, taking pictures of my family, of events, of friends, the usual stuff.  This camera makes it so easy to get professional quality results, I cannot believe it! I will admit, there is a lot about it I have not figured out yet (note to Fuji, a CD-ROM interactive user guide would ROCK!) but it is relatively easy to use with minimal instruction.  And the picture quality is incredible.  Some day I will read the guide and find out all it can do, but even without, I am having a ball!I asked several casual photographer friends their recommendation before I bought and the S5000 was the overwhelming favorite.  The 10X optical zoom is amazing, and the only time the 3.1 megapixels could be a drawback is if I was to blow a photo up to photo size (highly unlikely!).  I was told to go for zoom over megapixels, and I am glad I did.  My first series of photos was St. Patrick's Day parades, and I was able to get some GREAT shots of my daughter's bagpipe band and some shots of her piping in the parade.

He has little patience for using complicated cameras. This camera is great for him because he loves to travel the world to go fishing and he wants shots of the scenery, native animals and, of course, those close-ups of the fish he caught. It has multiple features which make it a great choice. We tried the camera out on a day trip to Williamsburg. First of all, the ability to zoom in without losing the quality of the shot is incredible. He took pictures of the flags at the top of buildings 1/4 mile away and details were visible that weren't by the naked eye at that distance. Macro mode worked great. I took extreme close-up pictures of small parts of the Christmas decorations that almost look 3-d. We tried the videomode on a moving horse-drawn carriage that was nice since the clip-clop sound of the hooves could also be heard. Is it the quality of a real video camera - no. But it will still be a nice memory of the trip without having to carry two different cameras. We tried the night-time mode for infantrymen lit only with gas lights. As long as we positioned ourselves properly so the gas lights illuminating the men, we got some decent shots.Taking snaphots of our grandkids (who are active) is never easy with any camera, but at least you know whether you picture turned out so you can take some more. With film cameras, I always took multiple shots to make sure one turned out and then had to pay to develop all of them. My suggestion for shots that you can't live without is to use the option of taking 5 quick pictures in a row. We have used this for taking pictures of blowing out birthday candles. These sequenced shots can be cute for the photo scrapbookers out there!This camera can be used as a point and shoot with ease! Directions are clear and you can take pictures immediately after you you've put the batteries in. However, if you want more from a camera, you've also got it with this one. We kept the instruction book with us as we toured Williamsburg and could easily figure out how to use all of the modes we wanted to try. Many instruction books are not as easily understandable.Do go ahead and buy yourself at least a 128 mg. SD card as well as rechargeable batteries and charger, if you need one. You can even buy filters for this camera if you want to. We plan to invest in some filters before we head out to Alaska this summer.Finally, remember the zoom ability you have with this one for the price!

That flaw is the overly aggressive jpeg compression on standard shots.Great things about this camera:  The movie mode is surprisingly high quality, though low-res at 320*240.  I took it to a concert with a huge xD card and the video and audio quality were very good.  (I listen to a lot of bootleg audio.)It does take very, very good shots.  Make sure you have a steady hand, as the incredible range of zoom, shutter and exposure can lead to blur.  Fuji's non-square CCD technology makes great shots.The features available to control your shots rivals that in digital SLRs.  In fact, I moved to this camera from an Olympus digital SLR.  At the cost, there is no comparison to any other camera on the market in late 2003/early 2004.It takes wonderful low-light photos but you must learn the exposure/shutter features (like on any camera).  The ability to emulate ISO 800 is great.Coming from an SLR, I thought having an electronic viewfinder would be disadvantage.  It is, but this viewfinder has great quality for a pro-sumer class camera.10x optical zoom:  need I say more?OK, so the major flaw.  The jpeg compression on the pictures it takes is way too aggressive.  The wonderful Fuji CCD quality is simply thrown away in 90% of the shots you will take unless you leave it in RAW mode and the RAW mode disables several features.  Sharp details and fine texturing are lost because of the compression.  My last camera had three quality settings in addition to RAW, this has none, well, one, and it's too agressive.  My dream is that Fuji releases a firmware update for this, but I doubt it.Nitpicks:The RAW mode saves in it's own RAW format requiring Fuji's software to be installed.  If it weren't for that RAW format, I'd have no need for more software clutter on my computers.  Other Fuji cameras I have used save RAW as TIFF, so what was Fuji thinking on this one?The included xD card is entirely inadequate.  Again, what were they thinking?  I only used the included card for test shots before putting in larger cards I bought at the same time.  If this was a marketing decision to sell larger cards, the 16MB should have just been thrown in as non-removable base memory.It does seem extremely sensitive to hand movements.  Maybe some mild stabilization would have been a good design, they fit in much, much smaller cameras.The shutter press results in the photo being taken a signifigant fraction of a second longer than I expect.  Though true of many cameras it is particularly exaggerated on this one when compared to my last Olympus.  It is frustrating to take good candids with this camera.  The focus lock (half the shutter button) should actually lock the focus for true instant shots.There isn't a better pro-sumer camera out there in this price range!

This Fuji allows me to point and shoot or have more control over pictures much like a more advanced SLR. The picture quality is excellent and if you do not fall prey to the \"more megapixels must be better\" ideal, then get this camera. I try to explain to people that more MP doesn't mean a better picture within the sizing constraints. Meaning, this 3 MP S5000 takes a better 4x6 and 5x7 than a 5MP camera within the same size. Only if you need to go larger than 11x14 should you even consider another camera. This is a solid camera with great features and performance. The 10x zoom is scary (meaning unbelievable), and the picture's colors are realistic and truer to life than most Kodaks I see which seem to exaggerate colors making a picture seem better than it is.

The battery life is great as well - After 5 months, I've gone through the batteries that come with the camera, and am only on my second set of Energizer E2 lithium batteries - and I use the camera a lot. The camera is really easy to use, and although many reviewers have said they needed a tripod to get clear pictures using the 10x optical zoom, I haven't had a problem with them coming out blurry at all just by holding the camera in my hands. There is hardly a lag like most digital cameras have between the time when you press the shutter button and when the picture is actually taken - I've taken hundreds of pictures of my brother's soccer games, and with a little practice, have gotten a lot of great action shots of him.

I've always loved taking pictures and I want to start really focusing (no pun intended) on photography.  However, I didn't want to start with a $1500 digital SLR and then discover I'm not really as into photography as I'd hoped. So I researched cameras in this price range. The Fuji S5000 stood out as a great starting point for many reasons:1. Awesome zoom.2. Sturdy construction.3. Good for action4. Great price.5. Easy controls.What concerned me were professional reviewers saying that there was \"noise\".  So I looked at betterphoto dot com and reviewed pictures taken with this camera.  I found night shots, shots of fireworks, portraits, action and macro all with perfect detail.  Many of the photo were competition winners.  That was enough for me.  I read a review here saying the noise obscured details.  Huh?  I have taken macros of bees in mid flight with the antenna and fuzz perfectly in focus and clear.  I've taken night shots as well--all lovely.  I don't notice noise except in the lowest light and that was because I hadn't figured out my camera settings yet!  This is the perfect starter camera for me.  We've gotten great action photos, great portraits, wonderful landscapes.  I love it!  It does have some \"warm up\" lag time and like all digitals it's got shutter lag (reduced with pre focus considerably).  This means you have to plan your shots carefully, but in order to avoid this you have to go film or Digital SLR and both of those aren't options at this point.Bottom line: Don't compare this to cameras that cost three times as much--it's an unfiar comparison.  I compared it to other cameras in it's price range and class, including the Dimage Z and some others.  The others were very flimsy feeling, awkward to hold, and unimpressive all around.  I'm very happy with my camera.  I'm also hooked on photography and will practice with this camera for a year or two and then invest in a true Digital SLR.  But for a digital with an SLR feel and the ability to take amazing pics this camera is exceptional.  I love it.Get a 512 card--you won't regret it.

The Fuji Finepix S5000 is relatively easy for a digital beginner like me to learn with, but also has enough features to satisfy the creative needs of a more advanced user. Set the dial to \"AUTO\" and you can pretty much just point and shoot. More advanced users can adjust shutter speed, aperture, focus, flash, etc.The camera itself seems sturdy and is ergonomically designed so that it \"feels good\" in your hands. When taking pictures you can easily toggle between the LCD (which is small compared to some models but very bright and easy to see) and the camera's Electronic Viewfinder (EVF).Fuji FinePix S5000 has a special \"Continuous Shooting\" mode that enables you to take 5 frames at intervals as short as 0.2 seconds-perfect for capturing the action at sporting events or getting good pics of moving subjects like kids & animals. Other features include \"movie mode\" (allows you to shoot brief moving pictures w/sound - the length of these movies is limited by the size of your memory card), a macro setting for close-up photography, red-eye reduction, a self-timer & a lot more.I've taken a number of pictures indoors under very poor lighting conditions.

It helped me to read one review on epinions.com where one guy wrote detailed examples of what settings he used and the limitations/advantages to each.  Also, I looked at the dcpr review (...)and don't agree with all the comments (it is mentioned that you can't control white balance, but you can, and there are 3, yes 3 different controls for flourescent light - forget the filter! There is also a photo gallery so you can see some examples.  Imaging Resource (...) is also another excellent site for viewing the photo capabilites of this camera.It has a continuous shooting mode, which is great for taking shots of quickly moving subjects (toddlers escaping!) but I also put the camera in the SP mode on sport and get really great shots that way, too.Some other tips by other people:Some tips: 1) use the chrome color setting to get better saturation 2) combine tele and manual focus, if you want to fill frame with your subject, e.g. your kid's face 3)get a UV filter and lens cap put on to protect lens; 4) or put on a polarizer filter to get richer colors ( a must have for seiour scenary phtography); 5) for in-door pictures, better to forgo the automatic settings and use the \"P\"(programable) or \"A\" (aperture priority) to set ISO to 400(800 only at 1M) to ensure maximun shutter speed to avoid shaking,\"slow-syc\" flash mode helps with low light conditions too.This camera isnt' perfect, but as this is my first serious digital camera, I think it's great.

My only real problems with the camera is that there is no place to mount an external flash, you cannot use different lenses (there are attachments available for some changes) like the Canon EOS or some Nikons,  and that the manual focus is too distracting for me to use. The autofocus does allow two options with one being continuous focus (takes more battery life) or the auto focus just prior to each shot which takes longer to take a photo.For the price, I have not seen a camera that I would rather have.

Really, few will ever need more than 1mp for typical picture-taking, and the sharpness and accurate color balance this camera produces even at that \"low\" resolution are more than satisfying, even in low light conditions. And, at 1mp, you can shoot and store a number of photos equal to approximately twice the meg rating of your memory card. The lens is sharp and as good a quality as I've seen in any consumer camera, even at its vaunted 10x optical zoom (where you'll need a tripod or other solid brace -- it doesn't have the digital stabilization found on pro cameras). Photos download in a few seconds direct from camera to computer. I like the locked-down flash -- it doesn't fire off inadvertently when you're inside a museum -- and the battery life is as good as I've ever seen on a digital camera. It's unlikely, but should your rechargables ever expire while you're in the field, you can pick up a set of ordinary AAs. The digital WYSIWYG thru-the-lens viewfinder with diopter adjustment is superior to the typical optical rangefinders found in this bracket of cameras. A full range of manual priority settings, the ability to shoot black-and-white and \"Kodachrome\" (color-saturated)photos and a lens hood that accepts standard 55mm filters complete this very attractive package. Drawbacks: the camera, while small, is oddly shaped and is too large for the typical digital camera case or your pocket but rattles around in a 35mm camera bag.

I even felt so good about it that I wrote a review.  Now, 3 months later I am regretting my decision to buy the s5000.  In December 2003, shortly before Christmas the camera began stuttering into playback mode while I was shooting.  I immediately became concerned because about 6 months ago I owned a Fuji 3800 that did the same thing before it progressed to turning itself off and becoming generally unusable.  So when this started happening with the s5000 I immediately dug out my warranty card and shipped the camera back to Fuji for repairs.  I have yet to receive any word of it from Fuji.  It strikes me as being too coincidental that both Fuji digitals I have owned in the space of a year have had the same problem.  I never exposed them to extreme weather, they were never dropped, I treated them very well.  I guess I should have learned my lesson after the 3800 but I work in a photo lab and we use all Fuji equipment and I can say with confidence that they make very high quality lab products.  I thought I just got a lemon and it wouldn't happen again.  Well I was wrong.  I just wanted to let you all know about this potential problem so you don't end up in the same boat as I am:  $800 and two cameras out the window in less than a year.  For your own sanity, remember to register your camera and keep your warranty info!

Two weeks!  I am sending the camera back and requesting a replacement this time.  I strongly suggest people use caution before purchasing digital cameras from Fuji.

I did NOT pay for a refurbished model, and they will give me a NEW one before I am through.  I am also telling all of my customers at work not to buy Fuji cameras because of their poor quality.

Well I was a bit nervous becasue I didn't have much information about it, but the wife liked it so we got it. As it turns out, this is the perfect digital camera for me. It takes beautiful pictures even though it is only 3.1 MP. We have had some develouped at the Kodak digital camera stations and they look just like film. Some of the features that you will love about this digital camera are:1. 10x OPTICAL zoom. Most digital camera advertise how much digital zoon they have. This is a totally useless feature for me. I mean think about it. If you have a digital camera, yours pictures are going on your computer where you have digital phote software to edit or zoom your photos.2. Complete SLR like controls. On most of the digital cameras that don't cost $800 you are stuck with basic controls and options for fine tuning your pictures. Not so on this camera. You can choose a variety of picture modes as well as film speeds, aperature, shuttere speeds and so on.3 The ability to attack filters and adapters lenses. While this feature may not apply to al users, it does increase the overall flexibility of the camera. For example you can buy a 1.5X telephoto adapter and increase your zoom to 15x instead of 10x or you can add a polorize filter for outdoor picturtes.One caution that I have noticed however. If you are using lens adapters or filters (I have both) you need to zoom in a few steps, otherwise the corners of your pictures will be rounded off. I think this may be a design flaw in the off brand wide angle LENS ADAPTER I bought, NOT the camera.All in all its a great camera and great for those who want to move beyond a simple point and shoot and take the step up and have control over their pictures.

It has the same problem as every other digital camera in that you have to push the shutter button half-way down to lock the Auto-focus, and only then can you snap an instant shot, but on top of that, this camera doesn't take the shot immediately when the shutter button is pressed all the way down, there is a millisecond delay, just enough to lose a good shot.  In addition to this flaw, the Electronic view finder and the LCD both go blank for an instant while the auto-focus is locking, which means that a shot framed a second earlier is lost when the screen goes blank for that short time, and the camera must be refocused.  In combination, these two flaws make it almost impossible to take action shots, even in \"action shot\" mode.Other than that, the colors in the photos are rich and the auto-focus works well.  The details captured are quite nice, and battery life is average.  The video mode is convenient and clear, and the manual settings come in handy for many subjects.

At first I was hesitant to go digital because I knew that I wouldn't want to print the pics off on my printer and I didn't want lots of pics on my computer slowing it down. Then, I discovered the many online digital photo processing sites (i.e. Shutterfly, Ofoto, Snapfish).While I loved the features of the camera, the deciding factor as to whether or not I'ld keep the camera was how they turned out in print. One word...WOW! These pictures were as clear and crisp as my 35mm camera (which by the way is also a Fujifilm). Also, the pictures that I took on 3MP quality, can be printed off as large as 16x20. I am so excited that I've finally decided on my new camera!As far as the cons I listed...the flash does not popup automatically. However, there is a green blinking light that will remind you that you need the flash. And as far as the 16MB included card. Fuji could have sprung for at least a 32MB card.

Along with the F5000 (a real bargain now) this camera allows a user to learn photography from full auto to full manual without the high expense of film and processing.You don't even need a Video Camera! The vast majority of video that I take of family and other cute stuff are very short in duration. This camera does 30 frame per second (that means it's like TV, without any jerky movement or lost frames) and the clips are already fully digital and ready to transfer to computer or display to tape. Put a lot of short clips together and you have the same thing you would get from a camcorder only it's all in one camera!Hot Shoe - Unfortunately, the S5000 does not include a hot shoe.  That's the only real problem with this camera.The quality of the photos in the S7000 is tremendous. We stopped doing film photos a few years ago when a local processing company destroyed the only two rolls of a friends wedding back east. Naturally, after that the memories of the trip were gone! They only appologized and moved on! With digital, we have never been disappointed.A major plus of the S5000 is the 10x OPTICAL zoom!  (Ignore the digital zoom, it just degrades the quality of the photo anyway!)  The S7000 has a 6x Optical zoom but twice the photo size.  The S5000 is also significantly smaller than the S7000, and may be easier to use for someone with a smaller hand.Both the S5000 and the S7000 are, in my mind, two excellent cameras for the typical family! And a real money saver! I especially like the little graphic in the viewfinder that reminds you that there might be some camera shake and to hold the camera steady!

Blah Blah.This review, I'd start with the little things I don't like, first....1) The built in flash, while not user friendly and bright, IS NOT bright enough for many in door or cludy day shooting purposes.  It would be perfect if the S5000 came with flash shoe adapter.2) Everytime you take out the batteries, it resets itself, no more time, date, month, year and Resolutions.  Have to set all up again.  This camera records in 1MP, 3MP, and 6MP. But once the batteries are disconected, it defaults back to 1MP recording.3) Digital Zoom, a bit flaky and grainy and very obviously digital zoom.Now, what's good about Fuji S5000?Absolutely everything else. ABSOLUTELY.10X Optical zoom, great focussing, lively color,lighting,metering, ISO flexibilty, black n white option, comes with a 55mm adapter ring you can fit with UV, and other great stuff like polariser (which I use frequently).Recently I even added in a wide angle converter (because S5000 angle no wide enough) and it's still taking stunning beauties (outdoors only tho)I even won 2 amatuer award for some pictures I took with this camera.I know you can get it anymore as its an obsolete model, but watch out for Fuji S9000.  It should be the next best thing after S5000.Don't be fooled by S5500, S5100, or S7000.  They higher in resolution but don't take as good photos, my opinion anyway (used them too) but stuck to S5000.  If Fuji comes out with later versions of S9000, I'll get one.  The S9000 is the same bulk and size, and weight as an actual DSLR already but still lack certain SLR functions (ie. lens change, flexible aperture priority, etc), so might as well get EOS400 (Rebel 10MP), if you want to get the S9000", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "The top of the line", "Author": "Young Photographer \"Chell\"", "ReviewID": "R3GLBUYR1ZX0BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about a year now, and I love it more every time I use it.

(not a good idea). Having said that in this case you would not go far wrong. The camera is packed with features that will please not only the casual snapper but also those who would like to get far more involved in their photography.The lens is as good as anything in this price range and the zoom is up their with the top range models. If you just want to let the camera make the choices for you leave it on automatic, your photographs will be excellent. If you already have the technical skills or would like to make your own decisions regarding shutter speed, aperture, white balance etc. the camera allows you to do this. The different modes allow portrait; landscape, night shots, I could go on forever. I like to take pictures of my cacti collection and the macro facility is excellent. The camera fits in the hand beautifully and feels like a solid piece of equipment.

They are of my sons and I am picky when it comes to hanging pics on my walls.  They better be awesome.  This camera takes wonderful shots.  So to those who said contrary, I think they must be doing something wrong.----------------------------------------------------------------I can't begin to express my satisfaction with this camera.  It has all the features for a serious photographer like my husband but an awesome auto feature for the moms like me who want great pics of our kids but I only want to turn it on to shoot.In less than 2 hours we had everything figured out and was impressed with how easy it is to use.  My immediate concern was taking indoor shoots - nothing but awesome shots.  My husband was taking pics while driving at 55 mph in his car and even those came out great.  I know it will be worth my learning all of the feature of the camera because his pics can achieve more than mine...but my baby spit-up looks great too.  The continuous shots is great for sports.  I tried it out taking pics of a TV program...it was amazing.  And there are multiple ways to get continuous shots.  The focus ability is amazing.  You can take shots up close, far away and have objects in both places and you can achieve any focus you want (i.e., some objects in focus, all objects in focus, etc).  The zoom is awesome.  ANd you can add a telescopic lens to get 20 optical zoom.  I do wish the camera had the ability to add an extra external flash in case this one dies.  But, some things are worth the sacrifice.The price is awesome.  Why waste money on extra megapixels when the biggest I would print out would be an 8x10.  The optical zoom is what is fantastic.The camera says it can take pics at 6 megapixels - they look the same as the 3 so I don't think it's worth the file sizes.Of course, the 16 meg stick it comes with is useless.  We purchased a 512 and don't regret it at all.  I never have to change sticks so I don't have to worry about losing it, or that I could break it (it is small).  We can take over 600 pics at the peak settings.  600 pics - that's incredible.  Worth the extra $$.I will say the one thing about the camera is the size.  I have small hands and I was looking for something easy for me to hold, easy to carry on vacation, not bulky, etc.  It's awesome for me.  My husband has much wider hands and he manages OK.I researched this camera and others until I got so sick of looking at another review.  This is by far the best one especially for the price.

It has great features and produces quality prints without costing a fortune. My husband and I got our S5000 in May and we LOVE it!  We had been working with a Sony Mavica, which we enjoyed, but we had decided to get something a bit more advanced.  In the S5000 we found exactly what we were looking for.The S5000 has 10x optical zoom plus 2.2x digital zoom which impressed us.  We had to adjust a bit to using this camera since it does have quite a few more features than we were used to but it has been enjoyable playing and learning.  One thing that has taken a bit getting used to is the delay on the shutter.  When you press the button to take a picture, there is a 2-3 second delay which means you may not get the exact picture you intended. At first this was a bit annoying; however, with some practice we have learned to adjust to this.  This camera has the ability to take MPEG video so it gives us the versatility to make a short \"movie\" and since we have small children this feature has really been fantastic for catching some funny moments that couldn't have been captured with just a single shot alone.One thing I initially was worried about was the quality of the pictures since this camera was \"only\" 3.1MP.  So far, this has not been a problem.  The pictures that we have had printed thus far have been of very good quality.  While the color is not quite as rich and the pictures are not quite as crisp as what we get from our 35mm, they are much better than what I had expected.A couple of things to think about when budgeting for this camera.  First of all it only comes with a 16MB card which doesn't hold a whole lot of pictures and even less if you do ANY kind of video.  You should definately plan on getting a larger card (we bought a 128MB one).  Also, this camera can use regular alkline batteries but do yourself a favor and buy some rechargable ones.  This camera sucks regular batteries down VERY quickly.  We got rechargable batteries but also keep a small pack of alklines just in case.  Finally, I would recommend getting one of the optional kits that are offered.

I have had it for so long and have used the hell out of it and it is still going strong. Now I see the going price for these is around $170, I would say its still worth as much as a new cameras in the same class.The picture quality is excellent, especially on the highest resolution settings, and the camera is easy to learn what it takes to get a good shot. I went through a stage where I thought the quality wasn't good enough because I've seen other images from high end Canons and Nikons and such -- of course the images are not that level of smoothness and color balance -- but I have still taken countless shots that leave my mouth open because I am so impressed by the quality.The battery life is also very good for this camera, but only after you realize that you need to get good batteries like Energizer e Lithium and such (this camera holds 4). I remember when I finally put in some $17 Energizers, because I wanted to make sure my camera lasted through a wedding I was taking photos for -- I ended up taking over 700 pictures that weekend -- and the batteries lasted me about three weeks!!! I didn't use the flash that much.Another point about image quality: I eventually began using a .45X wide angle high definition lens with macro and I noticed the image quality is consistently and considerably better with each shot I took, and I get a little bit more in each shot. The light quality is better with the lens, thats for sure.I think thats about it. The camera has several settings but its not that complex. You can control all the basics and its pretty logical.SUCH A GOOD CAMERA.

I had an OLD rinky-dink Fuji camera with which I was very, very happy for years. When I felt it was time to upgrade, I went with the Fuji S5000 because of the incredible zoom!! I was never a big camera afficionado, nor did I have any idea how to adjust shutterspeed (or why I would do it)....  basically, I just wanted a point and shoot with some room for experimentation. And I got that- set it on \"AUTO\" and it's your basic point and shoot camera. But it's been a BLAST learning to use this camera, and every shot comes out looking like a professional photograph. It takes fantastic indoor photos, and phenomenal, drop-your-jaw outdoor pictures. In fact, two friends of mine bought one after seeing some of my pictures online, and a third is considering it!

I have been looking into replacing my digital camera and began my search about 3 months ago. Nothing really impressed me until I came acrosss this most amazing camera. The FUJIFILM S5000 has been designed keeping in mind the beginner, to the professional. I would not say I am close to being professional, but I do know quality of images. I have an older HP Camera which takes decent pictures, but my biggest issue was taking pictures in a dim room, like a performance or show. This camera can focus and take amazing pictures in dim situations. If it doesn't focus right, you can use the manual focus. It was a little tricky to figure out at first. I actually had to open the manual which I hate doing, but once I knew what to do... its a very simple operation. To even better convince you, simply run to the mall, and pop in the RitzFilm store. You can ask to see this camera and try it out. You will soon notice another great design layout from FujiFilm for this model. It just fits perfectly in your hand. The layout of each button is just in the best spot for perfect picture taking. I would recommend this item for anyone looking for an amazing camera with all the bells and whistles. I love Target and shop here often, but I purchased this item at walmart.com for the reason it was $352.66. Over $46 in savings.

I've been meaning to go digital for awhile now, but have heasitated because most digital cameras don't have the right combination of features for my uses.I got this specifially for a recent trip to Wales & I've not had a second I've regretted it. Especially useful is the continuous shot mode which allows you to rapidly take several pictures in sequence. Since I was watching auto racing this allowed me to get multiple shots of each car as they passed by. I'm still getting to know all the features on this camera, but even at the begining I've had no problems with getting good pictures. This camera is highly flexible & I recommend it especially to anyone who wants a camera that can function as point & shoot but that also has high-end features to allow greater control over images when desired. Of note are its zoom(if you're shopping around, beware the \"digital zoom\") capability and the fact that it can take traditional lenses(it comes with an adapter if you want to use filters, telephoto lenses, etc)This camera is lightweight and seems sturdy (its lived through a lot of hiking through welsh forests with me so far).

Given that I use the camera in the correct lighting and without a shaky hand, all of my pictures are crystal clear and professional looking.  This is the perfect digital camera to own, and for having it for over 6 months, I am still certain that I made the best buy.

Because the camera amplifies the noise (a lot) as you inrcease the zoom (larger min f-number), i don't like to use it very much.  Pictures are only acceptable in bright outdoor light, with min f-stop.  Oh well, if you've never owned an Olympus, Sony, Canon, or Nikon, you may not realize what your missing.
