The first CamBall I purchased would not start at all.  I was able to contact the retailer who sold it to me and he gave great service replacing the bad unit immediately.The second cam I received worked well, recorded well, had great resolution, but after a few months the on/off button stopped working correctly; the spring under the soft button just broke.  Even so, I was able to continue using the camera for a year or so after getting it into on mode.After only a few months of use, the recorder would not stay on unless it was plugged into a 12V source. Another disappointment, but it was still recording when plugged into the car.I was not happy with the limited recording of the 2GB memory card so I purchased a 16GB memory card to extend recording time, but the Camball would not recognize the 16 GB card and continued to record only on the first 2GB.  After a bit of reading I learned that the firmware would have to be upgraded to work with 16 gigs. However, no matter what site or software I tried to use, I could not get the camera to download or install any firmware upgrades.Cut to today when I plugged the recorder into my home computer to look at the latest video.  Nothing has been recorded and as far as I can tell, nothing had been recording on the Camball for an unknown amount of time.If this was just a $50 unit, I would have been happy to just chalk this on up as a \"failed effort\" but this was not an inexpensive camera.  At $200 I expected more and believe I should have had a better experience than this.  Another poor quality Chinese product sold to a gullible American.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it!

Too many dysfunctional items, and complicated steps & buttons. It would be nice to simplify this toy and actually make it work.The disc does not update the new version for the camera. Then I tried to follow the poor instructions ( perhaps just bad translation) and set up the camera on stand by mode for the night after charging it 2.5 h. In the morning there was no recording. The only thing that this camera did: took nice manual picture shots and based on the clarity of the pictures I had high hopes. Then I tried to recharge it to see if I did something wrong for the night setup, but every time I tried to insert the USB cable it froze the computer. On another computer there was a message that said that the USB exceds the power, so back it goes. I am so disappointed! It looks like a nice toy with multiple acessories problems.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very innovative product", "Author": "georgepn", "ReviewID": "R3G16THJT20Y6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product is very innovative.
