{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Powershot S90 Has Arrived, and It's Fantastic!", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "RBNBKBVRF3H5X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Early ImpressionsI was delighted to have finally received my Powershot S90, and without further adieu, let me say that this is one heck of a camera. It's not perfect -- you can take truly terrible pictures with it just like you can take terrible pictures with a D700 -- but when used properly, the camera turns out remarkable shots that make us find it hard to accept the images are coming from a camera that fits in your pants pocket.What struck me first upon using it? First, it's size. This thing is small, and it's light, too. It's a bit smaller than my Panasonic TZ3 and TZ5, and it's lighter, too. (The camera uses a front and back metal construction with plastic on the top and bottom, but the Panasonic's, while also using metal, use a thicker gauge steel which adds a feel of sturdiness but also adds some weight, as well). The camera also has a high-quality feel to it. The buttons click and depress well (although the rear wheel is a bit too easy to turn, in my opinion). It has a rounded shape, so it feels comfortable in the hands, and when you stick it in your pocket, it will slide right in and out without snagging. The screen on this thing is simply gorgeous: why can't every camera have a screen like this? It's large, bright, and pretty high in resolution (461,000 pixels). You can't help but admire the camera's design once you get looking at it and using it.Next, the camera seems to perform well in terms of speed and overall operational use. The screen has the typical lag when taking shots, but you can adjust this somewhat in the menu system to speed things up, and quite frankly, every small camera I've ever owned exhibits this behavior. It is easy to use most of the camera's functions, and you may have heard about the programmable control ring around the lens on the front of the camera. It's operation is easy, solid (the ring \"clicks\" with detents at different positions), and, to boot, there is the standard programmable \"S\" button that the Powershots \"S\" cameras have typically had.But of course, I'm interested in high ISO operation, and so I immediately took it into the livingroom where it was quite dark, and just started shooting. I was quite surprised at the results. You are not going to necessarily submit these to win any contests, but for the most part, the camera took nice shots even in that bad shooting environment, and the vast majority of the photos came out quite well (I will post a few with this review). The camera is the first (along with the Powershot G11) to deploy Sony's new ICX685CQZ sensor, a 9.31mm diagonal sensor with high performance specifications. With a little post processing, many of them look quite good. As the ISO crept into the very high ranges (800 and above) some sensor noise became apparent, but this is certainly the best low-light performance I've seen in a non-DSLR so far. (See my explanations, below, to see why this is possible). Surprisingly, some shots as high as 1600 ISO seemed to be acceptable as long as you are not a \"pixel peeper.\" I was quite surprised when I discovered that a few of the shots had been taken at this high ISO 1600 level -- I've never had this experience before with a point and shoot camera.Outdoor operation is fantastic. My outdoor shots for the most part have come out very well, with rich color, great detail, and little sensor noise. Like most Canon portables, these images seem to respond well to post-processing (you can sharpen them quite easily, and Canon now uses a standard meta-data tagging format that is readable by virtually all photo editor programs.) I even turned the EV down -2/3 while outside, and the sensitivity of the camera is so good that, even with this reduction in EV, my shots came out sharp and clear. Again, I will post a few shots with this review.The camera TRULY excels at macro photography. The macro shots I've taken thus far are clear, sharp, and have great depth of field. In a word, they are superb: this camera is a macro shooter's delight. (A nice touch, too, is that in AUTO mode the camera automatically shifts into macro mode, without having to press any buttons!) The functionality just begs us to keep shooting macros over and over again. I've been able to take macro shots that I only dreamed of before, and the camera makes it easy to do so.And although this is not an objective measure, the camera is just plain fun to use. It works smoothly, is light, has a beautiful screen, and seems to keep cranking out one nice shot after another. Wow.Early Pro's and Cons-- PROS --1. Exceptionally small and lightweight (100 x 58 x 31 mm and 175 g)2. Increased sensor size for a portable with a lower megapixel count (Sony's new ICX685CQZ sensor, 9.31mm diagonal)3. Reasonably large zoom factor (28-105mm, approximately 3.8X zoom)4. Wide end is very wide for landscape shots, vistas, group photos (28mm)5. Fast f/2 lens permits high levels of light passage in low light situations6. f/2 lens makes shallow depth of field shots incredibly effective - this camera is a macro shooter's delight7. Two types of highly effective shake reduction technologies8. Design makes lens cap unnecessary9. Extremely high image quality for a pocket sized camera10. HUGE 3 inch LCD screen with 461,000 pixel resolution and 100% coverage of the shot you wish to take11. RAW mode allows for highest image quality and post processing12. Virtually every camera setting is user adjustable (ISO, shutter speed, aperture, EV, white balance, etc.)13. Ring-based control implementation one of the best on ANY current camera14. Reasonable cost for a camera of this ability (but watch the prices climb as the camera stays in and out of stock)16. Metadata being properly written to the file so they can be read by photo editing software (a problem with earlier Canons and some other brands)17. SDHC flash card is highly standardized, and is coming in larger and faster formats (necessary if you are taking many RAW shots)18. Extremely attractive physical design19. High quality construction apparent on first use20. Reasonably good battery life - most people are reporting about 300 shots (without flash) between charges-- CONS --1. Zoom ends at 108mm (3.8X zoom), which may be a deal breaker for some2. Does not take HD videos (but does shoot 640 x 480 at full 30fps)3. LCD screen not at the highest current resolution as seen in some DSLR's (but is great, anyway)4. Proprietary battery is an expensive proposition, as two or three are needed for daylong trips5. Camera case not included, and is expensive to purchase afterword6. No prices below retail due to the high demand of the device7. May be difficult to initially acquire due to high demand8. Still no \"universal standard\" RAW mode file format - the camera manufacturers need to address this soon!9. Mechanical noise when setting focus and moving between bright and dimply lit areas - this is the aperture being adjusted, but it can be annoyingSome Other Things I Can Tell You about this Camera (and the Powershot Line in general)Canon's reinstatement of the venerable \"S\" series within the Powershot line is a welcome move to thousands of photographic enthusiasts. Although the S90 announcement a few months ago caught the photographic community by surprise, the announcement was greeted with overwhelmingly positive reactions. As a person who had been greatly impressed by my older Powershot S80, a phenomenal camera for its time and a pleasure to use, I was one of them.Read the online posts of virtually any photography forum, and you'll quickly see there is no shortage of individuals, many of them longtime professional photographers, who have tired of carrying around anywhere from four to ten pounds of photographic equipment simply to get a few shots while out on a trip. (I think it may have been Scott Kelby who said, and I paraphrase, \"The best shot is the one you take,\" and if the weight and size of your equipment makes it so that you end up not bringing your camera with you, you won't take any photos at all! This is a corollary to one famous photographer`s statement that there is an inverse relationship between the amount of photos you take and the amount of equipment you bring.) The problem has generally been, however, that the smaller you make the camera, the worse the image quality of the photos the device can produce. This has set up a tradeoff between image quality and camera size, and, more specially, image quality and sensor size, which for years has forced photographers to take a stand with one side of the equation or the other, and then defend to the community why they made such a choice.Without going into too much detail here, the problem in manufacturing a compact camera that takes excellent images under a wide range of environments essentially boils down to the sensor, the electronic device that takes the place of film in older cameras. The larger the sensor, the more surface area for light to fall, and the higher the density of the sensor (in megapixels) the higher the sensor's resolution. Camera manufacturers have excelled at developing ever higher densities in sensors of the same physical dimensions -- many 12 and 14 mexapixel cameras are using sensors sized no larger than those on previous cameras possessing only 3 or 4 mexapixels -- but where they have fallen flat on their faces is in the development of sensors that have good resolution AND low noise. And the most direct impact of increasing mexapixel count on a sensor that remains static in size is the increase of electronic \"noise\" (also known as the \"signal to noise ratio,\" a term used for describing all electrical circuits, whether photographic in nature, or not), resulting in photos that have a grain like appearance with miniscule spots of white and color spread throughout the entire image, spoiling the photo's clarity and diminishing its overall appearance.The problem is that when more reactive pixels are crammed into a sensor of a fixed size, the size of the pixels themselves must be decreased to accommodate more of them within the same sensor size. But as pixels are made smaller, they also tend to emit more unwanted electrical emissions (called \"noise\") along with the desired output (called \"signal\"). As consumers have somehow mistakenly equated megapixels with quality (and the camera manufacturers  have done little, if anything, to dispel this misunderstanding), camera manufacturers have released successive waves of new cameras with higher and higher resolution, but with essentially the same sized sensors. These \"upgrades\" have driven noise levels higher, and have resulted in more cameras capable to taking \"good\" photos only in full sunlight where the signal from the sensor easily overpowers its noise. (This phenomenon is best seen when taking a picture in a low light setting, say inside a building, and the photo, if it comes out blur free at all, is laden with noise spots, making the photo generally unappealing in appearance and lacking in detail and clarity.)The approach to this problem has typically been to apply \"noise reduction\" processing algorithms to the image before it is written to the flash card, similar to techniques used by computer software image editing programs. And although this \"after the fact\" noise reduction approach can help, the truth is that, for most situations, there simply is no way to repair a photo so laden with noise: you can remove the noise, but the cost is a loss of detail, making such photos appear slightly soft and blurry, with little detail. Some cameras produce so much noise that noise reduction algorithms appear in all photos, not just low light shots, where even full sunlight shots present noise reduction artifacts in the resulting picture.That preamble may have been a bit longer than was expected, but it is an important background to the Powershot S90, a camera that attempts to tackle the problem of low light image quality in a manner few manufacturers have generally attempted:1. increasing the physical size of the sensor to a size larger than most point and shoot cameras2. reducing the noise generation inherent in the hardware sensor pixels3. increasing pixel size by reducing the number of pixels on the sensor4. using a \"fast, bright\" lens with a very wide aperture (f/2 at its widest zoom level) that allows a great deal of light to pass through to the sensorWhen these four approaches are employed, the result can be a portable camera that, under some conditions, can rival the performance of most entry level DSLRS, and do so in format that fits in your shirt pocket.The Powershot S90 has just now been released, and most all initial reviews seem to be extremely positive, including my own here. Functionality on the camera is praised, particularly with Canon's implementation of a very old, but generally discarded control mechanism: a ring around the diameter of the lens element serves as a selector for variety of user-defined functions in conjunction with a small function button on the top of the camera. The unit itself is diminutive in size and weight (100 x 58 x 31 mm and 175 g , respectively)  and makes use of a matte black finish with smooth  curved edges that maintains the generally rectangular shape.What is the price we pay for such performance? The primary one (and this may be a deal breaker for many) is that the camera zooms only from 28 105mm, making it effectively a 3.8x zoom, too little to be able to compare with compacts such as Panasonic's DMC-TZ5, which starts at this same wide end but (incredibly) zooms to 10x. But if we understand what the S90 is designed to do, which is to take high quality images even in less than desirable lighting conditions (at dusk, inside a cathedral, in museums, etc.), we can see Canon's strategy: don't worry about a lens that zooms across the football field and concentrate on developing a fast lens that transmits lots of light and excels at the wide end. In fact, the S90 is marketed as a camera that is particularly well suited to depth of field shots, where only one item in the frame is in focus, and the rest blurred, and in macro shots where the subject is less than 2 inches away. In this sense, we can say the camera's zoom is not a deficit in the design, but a strategy that helps the camera achieve its goals.My Canon Powershot S80, a camera I purchased many years ago, took pictures of startling clarity and quality. While possessing similar lens characteristics to the new S90, the S80 had no anti-shake technology, could hold only up to a 2Gb SD card, and had an optical viewfinder that wasn't too accurate. But none of that mattered: the photos that came out of the camera were some of the best I took in those years, and, to boot, the camera was constructed in a quality manner that distinguished itself from all other portables at the time, and was simply a pleasure to use. Early reviewers of the S90 are reporting these very same qualities, but now with a camera that is designed to push the boundaries of portable cameras into a new standard.COMPARECanon Powershot S80 8MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle Optical ZoomPanasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera Geek Alert: Right Camera - If it's the right job...", "Author": "surfbum", "ReviewID": "R24P9YHOFAZ9WE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Be warned, I am a self professed camera geek.  I believe cameras are like surfboards; you need a quiver of surfboards/cameras for the right wave/job.The Canon S90 is - by far - my new \"go to\" pocket camera and the one I will always carry with me in my flight bag.  I have been using it for just about a month now and after a couple thousand shots, only now am I getting comfortable with its functionality.  This is NOT the camera to buy your mother-in-law for Christmas.  She will never speak to you again.My other cameras are:Canon 7D - with 'L' series lenses.Pentax W60 (waterproof) - for surfing, sailing, biking, hiking, skiing and handing to the kids to beat each other with over the head.Canon SD980 - which was my *quality* pocket camera but will now be relegated purely to U/W scuba photography (since I own the U/W case anyway and would live in fear that my S90 meets the same fate as my S80 and gets flooded shark diving in Tahiti).Here's the deal with the new Canon S90:  If you are willing to delve into the sub menus and experiment it will become a very, very powerful camera in your arsenal.  It can do anything the G11 can do but because of the size you might have to work a little harder initially to figure out the functionality curve.  It's like flying.  Once your familiar with the controls (which takes awhile) the interface becomes transparent and you can make it do just about anything you want.  But it will take a lot of tinkering.  No lie.I'll leave the critique on picture quality for the professional sites but will just offer this: the results are very good for the size of the camera. The low light performance is best in class, period; and I've tried them all including the LX3 (which is also darn good but noisier - love that 24mm lens though).Bottom line, if you want SLR quality go buy an SLR.  You're not going to get the same results with the S90.  Duh.  If you don't like small cameras or have large fingers then maybe you should look at something like the G11.  The S90 is *too small* for all of its functionality but that's the dichotomy, isn't it?  The functionality is all there but by design is forced into a sometimes frustratingly cramped interface.  That said, this camera is very good at what it is: a pocket camera with a wide fast lens that can shoot in RAW.Let's talk about size. I'll agree that the build quality initially seems *cheaper* than what you would expect. That said, the case, dials, and shutter are all solid in real life day to day use.  Especially the shutter. To be honest, it's a bit strange but you can't deny the light weight and I love that it's smooth and flat and easily fits into your jeans.  It's as small as any compact with the exception of the lens ring/bulge and while I wish the bulge weren't there, it is what it is and the functionality of that ring is surprisingly awesome.  It's definitely more pocketable than the LX3.  The screen is gorgeous and I don't miss the viewfinder at all.The power up/down flash is irritating and I pray it doesn't break but I got to admit there is less red-eye than most cameras (which is supposedly why they went with the design). As long as the motor doesn't give out because I'm inadvertently holding the flash down when it tries to pop up I'll live with it and tip my hat to Canon's engineers.The control ring functionality is awesome and the Ring Function button is very, very functional and remains customized for each \"mode\" you select. In this way you can set up your camera for high speed Av photography different than for say Tv photography. Nice.On that functionality, making this camera do what you want really boils down to getting to know the camera. After a month, I can finally adjust aperture, shutter speed, and the four directional manual white balance without thinking about it.  ISO, exposure bracketing, flash intensity, metering, and continuous shooting are just a button/spin/button/spin away.  Once you've memorized the function layout, exposure adjustments are fairly quick and painless.  And of course you've got the outer control ring and function ring give you instant access to two of your major settings wether that be ISO, exposure metering, manual focus, white balance, zoom, aperture, or shutter speed.  You're really wasting the power of this camera if you just leave it in Av so you can shoot \"fast\".Whew.  Exhausted yet?  If you are then maybe this camera isn't for you. ;) No, seriously.However, if you are willing to commit yourself Canon has given you the tools to get the shot you want.  Or I suppose you could just leave it in AUTO.I'll see if I can figure out how to upload some sample shots but here are some real life experiences I've had.  Day shots of the NYC skyline are beautiful. A little soft compared to a Canon 7D with an 'L' series lens, but like I said before, duh.  The same shot at night can be accomplished without a tripod at about 1/60 of a second. No blur.  At an English Beat concert the other night I was snapping away at f2.0 (wide) and 1/100 of a second. Not always fast enough but about five times what I could do with my SD980. Stepping it down from ISO100 to 800 sped it up and while a little noisier, fit the concert like feel. Ice skating at night at Rockefeller Center (well lit) I was taking photos without the flash as if it were daytime.  In summary, this camera rocks.UPDATE: Low light photos uploaded to Amazon. Look for NYC skyline and adjacent concert pics. Unfortunately Amazon resolution is limited but you'll get the idea of what you can get away with.The one thing I don't get is the 640X480 movie mode.  I ask why, why, why knowing full well that there is an engineering answer that hasn't found its way on to the Interwebs yet.  Somewhere in the software/hardware mix there must be an answer because not including HD video is inexplicable to me.  On the other hand, most video I take with this kind of camera just gets uploaded to YouTube anyway so 640X480 is fine. That's what I've got a dedicated HD camcorder for.  One thing I will add, the sound quality is noticeably better than any other mono point and shoot I've used.  I'm not sure what's up with that but it's noticeably clearer with deeper base.  Kind of a nice surprise, really.At the end of the day this is a great camera and a very worthy successor to my beloved (and flooded) Canon S80.  If you want the smallest *quality* camera you can currently buy the S90 is it.  There are a few issues but that beautiful fast lens makes them bearable.  If you want an SLR like interface and are willing to sacrifice the size, then you should take a serious look at the G11 (or similar).  This camera is too small for that kind of interface and while the top level functions are intuitive (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) you'll have to commit yourself a little to go any deeper.  The beauty is, you can!Bottom line:  If I lost this camera today I'd buy another tomorrow.

Its unique characteristics are slim, low profile body with great noise control in high ISO plus 28-105mm f/2-f/4.9 bright zoom lens. The other advantage is the camera is very pocket able. It fits in your jeans' pocket.IMAGE QUALITY AND ISOCanon S90 IS has 1/1.7' sensor size which is slighty smaller compare to its main competitor, Panasonic LX3 (1/1.63\"). From my test, S90 IS image quality is very good across focal length but dynamic range (the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of an image)  is limited . This is also a problem most of digital camera out there, but S90 is slightly worse compared to competitors.However, regarding noise control and handling, S90 IS is excellent. The new algorithm works very well to reduce or erase most (if not all) chroma-noises which degrade image quality significantly. Image shot at ISO 1600 is very usable for regular print and web.BODY & HANDLINGCanon S90 IS has a slim, low profile look, so it is very good for street photography. It does not attract attention like digital SLR camera.For control, it has two main dials, both of them are round. One is located in the lens, and the back of the camera. The back dials also function as four way buttons. This design is similar to Samsung WB1000 design.Front ring dial can be customized for several options: adjust aperture/shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation, manual focus, white balance or zoom. The front dial is not like zoom barrel in the lens, it is not smooth, instead, it has several stops point. There will be a \"click\" sound to let you know if you hit the stop.I usually use the lens dial to zoom. There are five stops in the dial: 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 85mm and 105mm. All of them are popular focal lengths. I found this is much  better way to zoom rather than traditional way (pull a lever on the shutter). It is faster, less noise and accurate. It is great for learning how focal length affect perspective and distortion too.Mode dial is harder to change because they have put some resistant to it. It is to prevent accidental switch.There is also a shortcut dial which you can customized to many function such as AF servo, intelligent contrast, face detection and many more.Canon S90 has 3' 4:3 ratio LCD screen with 460k resolution. It is similar to Panasonic LX3, but better than typical compact camera. It is worse than Samsung WB1000 which has AMOLED screen (over 1 million resolution).However, build quality is not up to par with leading advanced cameras such as Canon G11 and Panasonic LX3. It made by metal but it feels plasticky. I have a sweaty hand and it registers my fingerprint! Also because of its flat design, there is no place to secure your grip. But overall ergonomic is not bad.OPERATION & AUTO FOCUSStart up and turn off time is fast. It only takes around 1.5 seconds for each. Compare to LX3: around 1.75 seconds, Ricoh GRD3 : 2 seconds respectively. Auto focus is typical compact., around .75 second, will take more time if you point to low contrast subject. Camera operation is very fast and very responsive upon instruction.COMPETITORSPanasonic DMC-LX3K 10.1MP Digital Camera with 2.5x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)Panasonic LX3 is an arch-rival of Canon S90 IS. It shares same concept of bright and wide zoom lens. However, there are many differences between the two such as the focal length, build quality, image quality and handling, please read Panasonic LX3 vs Canon S90 IS for complete comparison.Samsung TL320 12MP Digital Camera with 5x Schneider Wide Angle Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0 inch OLED Screen (Black)Samsung best advanced camera is similar with S90 in one way, they are both compact and has great handling. Samsung WB1000 has AMOLED LCD screen which is a lot clearer, Samsung also has wider and longer zoom. However, Canon S90 IS is better in low light condition.Canon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCDG11 is a big brother to Canon S90 IS, it has superior control and body handling, but it is much bigger in size.CONCLUSIONCanon S90 IS is a great choice for photographer who like a lightweight, pocket able compact but doesn't want to skim on image quality and control. It has very good operational speed and have some great customizable options. I especially like the zoom ring dial on the lens, which has Digital SLR like control. S90 IS is also superior in low light situation. However, Canon S90 Is also has a downside, such as below average build quality (relative to competitors) and limited dynamic range.Subjective rating compared to other advanced compacts in 2009  * Image quality 4/5  * Body handling 4/5  * Performance 5/5  * Features 3/5  * Value 5/5Please check my website for image sample, ISO comparison and more reviews.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon S90 vs. Canon G11: A Matter of Personal Preference", "Author": "G. Gilbert \"G. Gilbert\"", "ReviewID": "R26LM8G361Z3J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon S90 vs. Canon G11: A Matter of Personal Preference (I'm posting a very similar review under both the S90 and the G11.)I've been trying to find a 'carry everywhere' camera to always keep on my person so that I don't miss the amazing things that make up the events of everyday life (like tomorrow when I actually get to get off the R train at Cortland Street in Manhattan, something I haven't been able to do for years due to construction).  I wanted something that was (1) Small and (2) Had the ability for full manual controls for shutter speed and aperture.  The two cameras that fit this bill very well were Canon's S90 and G11 - Canon's top of the line point and shoots in their respective series (S and G).  But which one?The two major things that the cameras have in common (in addition to the above mentioned manual controls) are:1. The same image sensor (same size, etc)2. The same image processorAnyone who's written a comparison of the cameras will point this out quickly - because normally 'which camera' would come down to these one of these two issues.  In addition to these things, there are dozens of other features that both cameras share: this makes it very difficult to decide \"which camera?\"  Having owned both of them (but ultimately deciding to go with the G11 and returning the S90) I would like to make a short list of positive/negatives which I think could be deciding factors when trying to choose between these two excellent cameras.  Instead of listing both positive and negative points by each camera, I'll simply point out the positives of each that the other model does not share - I hope that this is helpful in your decision!S90: Advantages- Very compact: quite a bit smaller than the G11, it would easily fit in pockets and cases that the G11 never could.  If you're into Pelican cases like I am, you can fit the S90 in the Pelican Micro Case 1010 with room to spare.- More efficient controls: the ring around the lens is amazing and an excellent idea.  Especially when in manual mode, this makes setting aperture and shutter speed a snap (it's more awkward on the G11 - you have to use the small back dial and then toggle between aperture and shutter speed with a separate button which can get to be messy when you're trying to shoot quickly).- The f2.0 lens: a full stop faster than the G11's 2.8 lens.  This is a LOT of light, and especially important when you want to take photos in low-light situations (note though that the lens on the S90 doesn't zoom in far as the G11 if that's important to you - both lenses are the same focal length when zoomed out).G11: Advantages- Hot shoe: but on a compact?  Some people will say \"it's pointless to use an external flash on a compact camera - the whole point is to be compact!\"  That's a valid critique, but at the same time there are times when it's nice to be able to throw a flash on a compact if you really need one.  I own the 430EX and the 580EX II (both compatible) but I picked up the newish 270EX with the G11 and it works fantastically with the camera without adding a lot of weight.  Both the camera and the flash fit perfectly into the Pelican 1060 case side by side but with enough room to stay padded with the foam insert.  And hey - if I want to throw the nearly-twice-as-big-as-the-camera-itself 580EX II on the G11 I can do it!  Yet I can also do without it - the camera is versatile this way in a way that the S90 is not.- Vari-Angle LCD: which at first I found annoying.  The screen adds just enough bulk to the camera that it does not fit in smaller cases which it otherwise would.  When I first got the camera I was really rather annoyed by it in fact - not only because of the bulk but because it is actually smaller than the LCD on the S90.  I had to read another review to realize that it was a much better thing than I realized - because it allows you to hold the camera at all sorts of different levels and angles while still allowing you to see what you're shooting.  I really enjoy doing photography with the camera low to the ground (I have an angled viewfinder for my DSLR) and so this works perfectly for what I need.  As others have pointed out, the Vari-Angledness of the LCD allows you to flip it while in storage so that it's even more protected.- Remote Shutter Release: you can use one!  I love doing night photography and that the G11 allows me to use a cable release really seals the deal on the S90 vs. G11 for me personally (granted on the S90 you can always use the 2 second self-timer).  Good news too if you use a Canon Rebel DSLR - it's the same cable release.Both the S90 and the G11 are beautiful, well made cameras that will serve any photographer well when you're looking for something that's not DSLR sized.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "S90 x G11 - Making the right choice", "Author": "Andrea J.

I've used the G10 and G11 and, believe me, there's NO WAY you are taking them in your pocket!The big differences between the two, which I'm fairly sure you all know by now are:- The focal length (105mm for the S90 and 140mm for the G11)- The manual controls- The size- The hot-shoe (only the G's have them)- The flashWell, let me start by addressing one of the main complaints I've been reading about, the fact that the rear wheel is \"loose\"and that you can change your definitions without noticing it. It was a concern when I bought the camera and, to my surprise, it has NEVER been an issue while shooting. I don't have small hands and I don't know how other people hold a compact camera, but for it works like clockwork, no problem whatsoever. I even dare to say that if it was a bit harder to move it, it might take from the easiness of changing your controls before shooting the picture.The difference in focal length doesn't bother me. Would it be nice to have more on the S90? Yeah, sure. But is it a concern? No, not for me. I'm strictly against using the digital zoom, but on the few times I tried just to see the result, I confess I was a bit surprised (on the good side) by it.The manual controls are exceptional, the combination of frontal ring, back ring and shortcut button make it easy to change configurations and control the camera. And for those of you wondering about the speed in doing it, I can say that I've been taking pictures to make a book about the life guard service here and it's all about speed. Sometimes I take the S90 to the beach instead of the big DSLR's because people won't even notice me taking pictures with it, and the DSLR's always cause a fuss, specially when people are being rescued and are ashamed to be seen in that light...As for the size, I bought it to have a everyday camera always with me and this is the perfect one for this. A couple of friends decided to buy one after seeing mine (one of them is abandoning his G10 for it). And I was very, very pleasantly surprised by the image quality and camera quality I got with the S90, I never regretted choosing it and now, after having handled a G10 and a G11, I think I would be mad with me if I had chosen the G11 instead of the S90.Some reviewers have questioned the built quality of the S90, but I don't have any complaints about it, and it has been living in my pocket for over a month now, receiving some fairly rough treatment sometimes. As for the shutter release on the S90, yes, it is in a bit awkward position to be sure, but after one or two days with the camera you'll adjust to it. Is it a serious problem? Not even close!Regarding the hot-shoe and flash: well, I own two DSLR's, so if I want to put a big flash on top of the camera, I'll take the big one. It might be different for people who are buying this as their only camera. I hate flash and avoid using it always, even bumping the ISO to the moon, but, on the occasion I used the in-camera flash I was amazed by it's power.When I'm shooting \"professionally\" I tend to go with the RAW + JPEG mode, but sometimes I prefer to use the strict JPEG mode and it has a very interesting color control that helps eliminate the need for working the files later on. Anyway, you can change that configuration in about 2 to 3 seconds if you need to (the RAW/JPEG, because the colors are even faster).A lot of reviewers and photographers talk about the S90 exceptional AutoWhite Balance, but I don't really like it, I tend to prefer choosing presets all the time (I don't like the auto WB in my NIkon's DSLR's either), but that is also very easy and fast to do in this camera.Well, that's about it. I'm sure there are other reviews discussing the technical details more deeply, but I've been a VERY HAPPY S90 owner for the past month or so and I'm sure glad that I chose the S90 instead of the G11. To tell you the truth, I don't see much reason in buying the G11, as it is not a compact camera, it is not a DSLR, it is not lightweight, so it's a middle everything. But the S90, and I've been hearing the same opinion from others for the past weeks, seems like the queen of compacts for now (I hope the manufacturers start a \"fully manual compact\" cameras war now).I believe that, for most buyers, the S90 will always be the smart choice!", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "a non-photographer's opinion", "Author": "Jeffrey Stanley", "ReviewID": "R29BQ8F7IR88IM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a very amateur camera user.  I understand the basic terms and settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, image stabilization, exposure) but I am impatient and like to get things set and just use the camera.I bought this camera because I wanted the ability to use the camera indoors in low light without a flash. Due to the relatively high price, my expectations were high.My cam was delivered just last week, and having used it at an event in a local bar the best word I can use to describe this camera is \"magic\".  This camera takes in so much light it really seems like magic.The event I was documenting was in a very dimly lit room.  The only lighting sources in the room were incandescent chandeliers dimmed as low as they would go.I set my iso to 1000 in aperture priority mode, f2.0 (this level is only available in the widest zoom), adjusted white balance for incandescent, and took some shots.  Most of the shots used 1/6-second shutter speed, which was just fine due to the image stabilized lens.  The IS performance is improved over my last Canon compact.  I don't have steady hands, and I like to take quick sloppy shots.  If the IS in this cam can handle my hands, a very-careful steady shooter could probably get away with 1/4 second.  The resulting images were so bright and had such great color everyone that saw them was in awe.  The resulting images appeared more bright and colorful than with a naked eye.  Shooting with such high ISOs is like having night vision built into the camera.  Noise levels were low enough and color was so good that I can easily print very nice 5x7s from this night.I took a few candid shots of people in motion at the bar, so I had to bump the ISO to 1600 to get a faster shutter speed (at ISO 1600 I got about 1/30sec in the dimly lit bar).  At ISO 1600, color is still acceptable and very nice 4x6 prints, web postings, and email will be no problem.  ISO 1600 on this cam is comparable to what most compact cams produce at ISO 400.  I've never seen a compact cam take such great shots using high-ish ISO settings.I am just as happy with the results as when using my EOS 20D digital SLR.  A critical professional may argue that this cam isn't as great as an SLR, but for normal-sized prints and digital sharing, this camera makes images that are as good as a consumer SLR.My last compact was a Canon SD800is.  I love that camera, but images are mostly unusable above ISO400, due to muted color, and grain.  The S90 goes two full ISO stops beyond what can be done with a typical $300 compact camera.  Combine high-ISO performance with the f2.0 option and you can take great shots in 1/3 of the light required for most $300 compact cams.Adjusting camera settings is a dream.  I am just as in control as I am with my EOS 20D SLR.  I've used friends' canon rebel SLRs, and the controls on this compact are even better than them.  Between the front ring, rear dial, and shortcut button, you have instant control of three camera functions without even really looking.  All of the controls are customizable.  If you've ever used other canon cameras in the past, you won't really even need to use the excellent printed manual (yes! a printed manual!).I've not taken enough shots with it to test whether the battery can actually deliver 200 from a charge, but 200 isn't really great battery performance and I bought a backup battery from an Amazon marketplace seller for longer outings (under $30 shipped).I also highly recommend the Canon compact leather case.  This camera easily fits in any pocket, but I'm pretty sure that pocket lint and dust is what did in my last compact camera.  The Canon compact leather case for the S90 mounts on your belt and offers light protection away from keys and pocket lint.The body is comparable in size to Canon elphs.  My SD800 elph is 1/2in shorter, but the height and thickness is identical (not counting the lens ring, which makes the overall thickness of the S90 slightly thicker).  I posted comparison pics between the SD800 and the S90 in the gallery.The rear display is really sharp and is viewable outdoors.  I haven't bought a new camera in over three years and the display blew me away compared to my other cameras.  I really can't compare the display to newer cams.Simply judging by the way it feels in the hand, the build quality is just average.The only real performance weakness is continuous shooting.  Continuous shooting is really really slow.If you want a compact and think you'll ever want to photograph dimly lit subjects without a flash, this is THE camera to own.  The price is 40% higher, but it takes in 300% more light.  Unless you're shooting a lot of action, this cam is probably a better choice for people considering consumer-level SLRs like the Canon rebel line.I can't imagine anyone regretting buying this camera.

I needed low light capabilities for indoor and nighttime pictures without a flash and a wide angle lens. I purchased two cameras and compared them for several days prior to the trip. The two cameras were the Sony WX1/B and the Canon S90. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The Sony is smaller, has better battery life, and does HD video. It has some unique and interesting modes including the rapid 10 shot and slick panoramic modes. The Canon has faster glass (f/2.0), full manual controls, a unique flexible control ring/dial, RAW capability, great build quality/feel and very low noise levels for a pocket camera. Its battery charger requires only two hours. The downsides of the Sony include a slow included battery charger (6 hours but you can buy a faster charger for $50), cheaper build quality/feel, and really poor auto white balance requiring constant manual tweaking. The contrast and exposure levels on the Sony images were also inconsistent and almost always worse than those on the Canon requiring a trip to Photoshop for corrections. The Sony also had higher noise levels at all ISO values than the Canon. Lastly, the Sony engineers messed up placement of the flash. At the widest lens angle, the lens actually blocks the flash from illuminating the lower left corner of the image. The downsides of the Canon are it's larger size (but still pocketable), the lack of HD video, worse battery life (buy a second battery) and its narrower zoom range (28-105 mm equivalent vs. the Sony's 25-120 mm). The bottom line was that I was getting a camera mainly for pictures and while I will miss the HD video and some of the Sony's special modes, the picture quality of the Canon was superior to the Sony. Its low light capabilities were also greater with the faster lens, its own lower resolution high sensitivity mode, and lower noise levels. I sent the Sony back and kept the Canon. I took about 700 pictures and shot about 50 videos with the Canon on my trip and feel that I clearly made the right choice. While the Sony was good, the Canon was the winner for me. Even in auto mode, the Canon took consistently good pictures. This was important when handing the camera to someone to shoot a picture of me.

I realized that most of the pictures I take are indoors, and using the flash makes the pictures look horrible, so I set out on a quest to find a good compact camera that could handle low light.  I looked at the micro 4/3 cameras but they were a little too big.  My last camera was the Canon G9, it was better in low light than my previous Lumix but not great.  I am not a Pro, Semi-Pro, or even an Amateur Enthusiast photographer.  I don't care about the manual controls.  I want to put my camera in full auto and have it take nice looking pictures.  Boy does this camera deliver.  The indoor no-flash shots are AMAZING.  Compared to the G9 it focuses in low light situations very quickly and the results are clear and beautiful.  It can take photos usable in 3X5 size in candle light!  As you should expect from any camera daylight shots are also great.  I have never experienced anything even remotely close to the performance of this camera in the pocketable variety.If you are an average consumer who just wants a pocketable camera that takes really great pictures in both low light and full light stop fretting and press the add to cart button.  This camera is well worth the extra $100 over other point and shoots as it makes your camera usable for the other half of the day when the sun has gone down and other point and shoots totally fail.

I certainly don't feel like dragging around my Linhof large format or even my Nikon D3 with the huge body, lenses etc. for general photo taking.  Unfortunately Nikon doesn't make a high quality point and shoot with a fast lens (which is the opposite for pro DSLRs... Nikon is a step ahead of Canon these days).I was looking into buying the new Canon SD4000 which was just announced because it is so compact, but after looking into all the features, this S90 is still a far superior camera  if photo quality, features and manual operation are what you're after, and they are basically the same price. This S90 is also barely larger than the SD4000.  They both have the f/2.0 lens which is virtually unheard of on a pocket camera and the ISO performance is very good considering the size of these things, and the amount of technology that needs to be squeezed into this tiny body.  The SD4000 has these features, but the customizable rings on this S90 alone make this a much better choice for anyone looking for a real camera.  Also, the sensor on this camera is larger and the backlit sensor on the SD4000 can make some good low-light photos but will create lower-quality photos for general picture taking.With the ability to control aperture, iso, exposure compensation etc. on the S90 with the rings, and with the small size, high-end sensor and fast lens, this is the best point and shoot you can get.  This has the same innards as the more expensive, large, unwieldy G11 but with A FASTER LENSE (better low-light photos etc.).  The only drawback to this camera is that it's aimed at people who want great photos, not a bunch of gimmicks or conflicting features... so there's no HD video, only standard (and great looking) video capture.  I bought the S90 because I'm a photographer and I want to take great photos with something that fits in my pocket, and for that there is no better camera on the market as of late May 2010.

If you are expected it to manage the image quality or low light performance of your Canon DSLR you will be disappointed. But the S90 is the best compact camera I have ever used. You do get more than one stop of performance over the Canon SD880IS, my previous ultra-portable camera. The F2.0 lens, lower density sensor and improved software give you that.Software matters on these small cameras and Canon's software is a pleasure to use. The aperture ring feature, which can be used to control ISO, shutter speed, Aperture and other functions is a pleasure to use and has a very cool visual UI on the back screen when in use (think of the way the old Nikon cameras showed you the aperture ring in the viewfinder).The camers is not quite as pocketable as the regular line of SD powershot cameras, but the improved image quality and control easily make up for that.I like the camera. It has tons of manual controls, nearly all obvious in function without reading the manual if you are a Canon regular. They have increased the amount of on-screen documentation. The Auto ISO feature is better than before. They get that many prosumers don't want a flash and will take a noisy photo over either a flash photo or one too slow to hand hold.I typically own two cameras: a very small camera and a very large camera. This is my small camera and I would say that in the small camera department, if you care about low light performance and image quality more than zoom factor, you will love this camera.How can it be better? well, if it had the sensor they put in the Canon 7D, it would be much better.

I mainly use a DSLR ( Canon 5DII ) but I needed something that I could carry anywhere and still have the control I\"m used to with my Canon. The s90 delivers in features ( ease of use of these features ) and on size. I tend to keep things in AV mode, with the aperture control on the front ring and the shortcut button to jump to ISO settings. Between this and the little wheel on the back controlling exposure compensation you can make very quick decision on how to take the shot. The camera also starts up instantly, so you won't be missing shots due to this.Image quality is great when there is enough light and it's capable of taking shots with very low light as well ... but they will be noisy. That being said, when I use this camera, my photos will simply be emailed to family and friends, or printed no larger than a 6 by 4 photograph. With a little noise reduction and the size reduction to fall between these parameters, the photo quality leaves nothing to complain about. Prints look great, and by the time you get to that point, the noise is completely under control.There are certainly better cameras out there that cost a little less, but none of them will give you all of this at this small size, and that was the most important factor to me. If the camera is not with me, I won't be able to take the picture ... it's as simple as that. You can keep the camera in a coat pocket or non-jeans front pocket comfortably.

I've never moved the wheel when I don't want to, as there is a nice detent on the back for your thumb. The free wheel is great for reviewing pictures and making quick adjustments to manual focus. Your mileage may vary with this, though, since it's clear that many other people have problems with it.In conclusion, if your order of priorities are Size, Control, Image Quality - this is the camera for you.

This camera takes some very nice pictures in such conditions although no better than many other compact cameras including other much cheaper Canon models and with less dynamic range than some others such as the Fuji F200EXR.The challenge for all digital cameras is shooting in lower lighting conditions (indoors).  Cameras with large sensors, (DSLRs and micro 4/3 cameras),  handle this without too much problem in most conditions. Compact cameras which invariably have  small sensors and a weak flash struggle in low light (at higher ISO settings).  There are some older compact cameras which also have relatively large sensors and a strong flash (i.e. Fuji F20, F30, F31FD, Olympus C-7000, Canon G6) Some of these cameras are still available used at reasonable prices although they do not have image stabilization nor a wide angle lens.  The S90 with a sensor larger than most compact cameras sold today, is the best small low light camera currently available that I have seen (I am not counting the Panasoniuc LX3 as a small camera; see below).  The S90 is not comparable to even the worst DSLR or better than some of the older cameras mentioned above (especially the C-7000). The S90 is better indoors than the second best camera currently available, the Fuji F200EXR.  The flash on the S90 is stronger and the images look brighter and cleaner than the F200EXR in most instances. The S90's strong flash results in the battery discharging somewhat quicker than other compact cameras (a worthwhile tradeoff).  The S90 takes  much better photos at the wide end (where the aperture is at f/2.0)than at the telephoto end. At the telephoto end, the lens is modest in its range (3.7x) compared to some other small cameras and and is also rather slow(f/4.9).  At the telephoto end, there is obvious and heavy noise reduction being implemented in the .JPG processing.  This seriously compromises fine image details. The S90 offers RAW (unprocessed image)shooting but this is seriously compromised by serious image distortion (which does not seem to appear in .JPG images as far as I can see).The Panasonic LX3 does a better job in low light at mid shooting ranges (50mm equiv or so). The LX3 also has a fast lens as well as  large sensor (for a compact camera). The LX3 also has a much wider (24mm vs S90 28mm equiv)and faster lens (f/2.0-f2.8 vs. the S90 f/2.0-f4.9). I have been able to use the LX3 indoors without a flsh resulting in very usuable photographs. When attempting the same thing for the S90 I was disappointed at all zoom ranges except at its widest (28mm equiv) range. The LX3 may not be a fair comparison though, it is larger then the S90.  The main draw back is the very limited telephoto range on the LX3; only 60mm equiv at it longest (vs 105mm for the S90). The Lx3 is also more expensive than the S90.CONCLUSION:  If you do most of your shooting outdoors, this is probably not your camera.  The Fuji F200EXR is better outdoors, is cheaper and does a reasonable job indoors.  Similarly, if you are prepared to carry a bulkier camera, a  small DSLR (i.e. the Olympus evolt e-4xx series) is in the same price range and is a much better value and takes much better pictures.

After a ton of research, I ended up buying the Panasonic ZS3. While the ZS3 is a great outdoor camera, but indoor shots without a flash are terrible. I have never liked using flash, and being that its winter in Europe, I figured I would be indoors a lot. The ZS3 has a 12x zoom and great picture quality, so I decided to give it to my girlfriend and find a good low light camera. After a little research, I found the S90. The price on the S90 initially turned me off, but I decided to give it a shot.The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was the poor build quality compared to the ZS3. The top and bottom of the camera are plastic, and the top feels kind of loose right behind the flash. I had already read about this, so it didn't bother me too much. I had also read that the control ring on the back was very loose, but Canon must have corrected this because mine isn't. The LCD doesn't seem to be as high as quality as the ZS3 either, but its acceptable. This camera is a lot bigger than a lot of compact cameras, but its definitely not too big. It fits comfortably in my jeans pocket, but it's not small enough that you'll forget it's there. The 3.8x zoom might turn some people away, but I like to capture the scene as my eyes see it, and zoom isn't required for this. I kind of wish the lens started at 24mm instead of 28mm, but nothing is perfect.The image quality is outstanding in low light. I can't believe how well this camera performs at high ISO. ISO 800 is completely usable, and ISO 1600 isn't that bad. The noise suppression works really well, and there aren't many jpeg artifacts. Outdoor shots are excellent as well. The pictures are often overexposed with no exposure compensation, but its easily fixable. I usually set the exposure compensation to -1/3 to -2/3 for most pictures.I've really enjoyed all the manual controls on this thing. I usually shoot in P mode with the front ring set to ISO, the rear ring set to exposure compensation, and the shortcut button set to white balance. The M mode is really interesting, because the LCD shows you almost exactly what the picture will turn out like.Other than the cheaper feel of this camera, there is not a lot to dislike.

The motorized pop up flash is an annoying gimmick. The menus and function menu Canon has used for so many years are nice but navigating with the tiny S90 controls is a nuisance. I can operate the Panasonic LX3 more easily. The S90 focuses noticeably faster than the LX3. The S90 auto white balance is superior. I feel the S90 is well built.

I also have a Canon SD630, Canon SD1000, Nikon D50 and a Nikon D300. My favorites are the D300 and the S90. However, I still love my D50.  All of my camers needs have now been met.You can't beat the S90 for a grab and go camera with excellent features that take beautiful pictures.  It is very portable and is not cheaply made as stated in another review. Before using the camera, I read the manual and became knowledgeable about the various features. They enable you to take excellent pictures under a variety of lighting conditions by simply selecting the scene you want to use or you can go automatic all the way.  It is big fun to use the additional features. I usually don't load the software, but I did this time and I am happy I did.  When I purchased the camera, I also got an extra battery and a Canon case. I just purchased the AC Adapter Kit yesterday.  I don't have to drain the battery to transfer pics to my computer and this also allows me to take advantage of the software that came with camera. In taking pictures, there was one annoying glich. My finger gets in the way of the flash (there is not a lot of room) so I lowered my finger, as the book illustrates. If I forget, I turn off the camera so it can reset.The S90 is excellent in low light.  I recently took pics of my son's new home at night.  I couldn't believe how beautiful the pictures were. I also took pictures of his children in bright clothing (also beautiful) and video of the kids and their dog. The camera allows you to zoom in and out while taking video.  I am extremely happy with this camera. Ken Rockwell called it the \"World's Best Pocket Camera\".  I also read camera reviews on numerous Web sites, including Amazon's (always very helpful), before making a decision.Finally, yes it was expensive, but I plan on having this gem of a camera for a very long time.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Low Light Camera (better than DSLR)", "Author": "V. Poortinga", "ReviewID": "R11M58Q4FO7UE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a parent of a young child I'm interested in taking pictures inside, at night, without a flash.  This requires a camera with a \"fast\" lens.  What this means is a lens with a wide enough opening (aperture) to allow enough light in to use a fast shutter speed.  And fast shutter speeds stop action, which is needed when your subject (young children) will not stay still long enough to have their picture taken.The Canon S90 has the fastest lens available in a compact camera at f/2.0 (smaller number is faster).  When shooting at low light, I set the camera in aperture priority mode (Av), set the aperture to f/2.0 (the lowest number), then use the control dial to select an ISO that will allow a shutter speed of 1/100 sec or faster.  This will stop most action without making the picture too grainy (higher ISOs reduce picture quality).I also have a Canon 30D DSLR with a 50mm f/1.8 lens which is slightly faster than the S90, however in the low light situation DSLR cameras have something working against them.  Namely, the larger image sensors on DSLRs reduce their depth of field (DOF) at a given aperture over smaller sensor cameras like the S90.  Sometimes reduced DOF is a good thing, because it will render the background of your subject out of focus, bringing attention to your subject.  But at f/1.8 on a DSLR-sized sensor the depth of field is so shallow, literally the subject's nose will be in focus but their ears out of focus.To keep your full subject in focus on the DSLR, you would need an aperture f/2.8, f/4.0, or smaller (higher number).  These smaller apertures require a slower shutter speed (to let in more light) and reduce the ability to stop action in low light.On the other hand, the S90's smaller sensor doesn't have such a shallow depth of field at f/2.0 that you can stay there and keep your full subject in focus. (The S90 can still blur backgrounds with sufficient distance between your subject and the background.)The S90 is my kids camera of choice.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic point & shoot camera for photographers", "Author": "Smaug \"Jeremy\"", "ReviewID": "R1895UH6U8K03L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Rather than go over every little thing (it has been done) I'm just going to comment on a few main things:- For whom is this camera intended?- Image quality- RAW format with Macintoch computers- Accidentally bumping rear control wheelFOR WHOM IS THIS CAMERA INTENDED?Photographers. The occasional, non-photographer user will not get enough out of this camera to warrant the price tag. Snapshooters and informal shooters will be better served by buying a less expensive SD series camera. Snapshooters will not know how to take advantage of all this camera's features, and will likely be annoyed by these features being changed. If you normally leave your camera set to 'AUTO' or one of the scene modes, you are a snapshooter. If you don't know what 'exposure compensation', 'aperture priority', 'shutter priority' 'RAW', or 'macro' means, you are a snapshooter and would be better served by a mostly automatic camera, such as an SD series Elph or even an entry level SLR, if you don't mind a bigger camera for higher quality images.IMAGE QUALITYRemembering that this is a small camera, the image quality is outstanding. It handily beats my Canon SD600 Elph. Of course, being something like 1/5 the size of an SLR with a correspondingly smaller sensor, it is not quite up to that level. It is good enough that when I go to Europe in 3 weeks, I will be bringing this instead of my DSLR. The f/2.0 lens is no joke. It really is f/2.0 at 28mm. Of course it would be nice if it were f/2.0 across its entire focal length, but then it would no longer be compact and would probably cost $200 more. At any rate, 28mm is a useful focal length indoors, just not for portrait work. In my dimly lit condo unit the first night, I took a bunch of shots at ISO 400 & 800. The ones shot at 400 were f/2.0 at 1/6 sec. If I zoom way in and get unrealistically critical, of course I can see some noise, and of course I can see that an image stabilized DSLR will be sharper & cleaner. Again, I remind the reader that such is not the point of this camera. The point of this camera is for photographers, who already own & use a DSLR, to have an option of a high quality, fully adjustable camera that is also fully portable, and has a proper wide angle lens setting. The photos are fully printable at up to 16x20 if the photographer does his part.RAW FORMAT COMMENT WITH REGARD TO MAC USERSI have a Macbook Pro 13\" with the 2.26 MHz Intel processor, manufactured in 2009. I was happily surprised to see that iPhoto supports Canon's RAW format. I don't know if this is because I had installed the Canon software and it just carried through, or if it supported it with a software update. Nevertheless, I was glad to see it. Now I don't really have much use for the Canon software. I may try it out later to see if any of its extra features warrant my learning about it. iPhoto is not the typical photographer's choice when it comes to software, but if you're not trying to do super fancy stuff, it will do the trick. Cropping, highlight, shadow, exposure, rotating, color balancing, blemish removal are all easily accomplished, either on jpg or RAW images with this software. Also, there is a quick fix button that improves the exposure balance on most photos and doesn't blow out the skin tones in the process. It is really pretty brilliant. Go into it with an open mind.ACCIDENTALLY BUMPING THE REAR CONTROL WHEELI was a bit wary of purchasing this camera for so much money because of all the earlier comments on this. With a little common sense, I don't see why this should be a sticking point for anyone. Looking at the rear of the camera, a sensible person can tell that one's thumb is intended to go in the little divot below the main mode dial. After using the camera only a few times, my thumb naturally falls there and doesn't interfere with the rear control dial at all. Again, I remind the reader that this camera is not intended for ham-fisted individuals who are ready to denounce anything that isn't an DSLR. I remind the reader that DSLRs are designed to fit the user's hand. This camera is designed to fit the user's pocket, with the understanding that the user will need to make some ergonomic adjustment for the privilege of having such a small & highly capable camera. If you go into the purchase with this understanding, you will be a happy customer.The front control ring has click stops and is not easily turned accidentally.For me, the choice came down to either this camera or the Panasonic LX3. Although I prefer wide angle to telephoto in a zoom lens, I couldn't do without telephoto altogether, so I chose the 28-105 of this camera instead of the 24-60 of the LX3. The camera is also notably smaller, which was the whole purpose of using this over my DSLR to begin with.August 21, 2010 update - I like the camera more every day. Its construction is high quality, its images are high quality, the look is high quality, etc. I dropped mine on a concrete floor in an opera house after only a couple weeks of ownership. Put a nice ding in right on the edge of the frame around the screen. But it still works like a champ. The moral of the story is do not put it in a shirt pocket, because when you bend over to get something, you will have forgotten it is there and it will plop right out. The picture quality is so good that I rarely bother with my digital SLR any more. I have not had any issues with dropping it due to overall slipperiness. I just use the wrist strap and a small rubber band to cinch it snug. The pop-up flash doesn't really surprise me, because I never use it. I don't need to, with the excellent optical image stabilizer and fast lens. Also, the noise control for jpg is very good, so I can shoot up to ISO 800 without seeing any appreciable amount of noise. Highly recommended camera. One thing I will point out is that if you don't also spring for the fitted Canon case, you might consider the Canon G11. It has a longer zoom, more direct access controls, a hot shoe, and if you don't get the smallest case possible, the S90 is not really a pocket camera any more. I went with a small LowePro case that has room for two spare battery packs and a spare memory card.

It comes mighty close in quality to my DSLR camera, a Canon 450D. (for those unfamiliar with photography lingo, a DSLR, which stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex Camera, is what professional and semi-professional photographers use). I wish to highlight a few points on this camera.- Phenomenal Image QualityMost point-and-shoot (or compact) cameras have sensor size of about 1/2.5. The S90 has a sensor size of 1/1.7, much larger than sensors on most point-and-shoot cameras. As a rule of thumb, the larger the sensor, the sharper and better quality the image. (By the way, the S90 has the same sensor size as the G11. My DSLR, a Canon 450D, has a sensor size of 1/1.6.) With a larger sensor, the image quality of the S90 is simply superb! The images are sharp and there is very little noise in even moderately well-lit environments. Very few point-and-shoot cameras hold a candle to the image quality of the S90.- Images In Raw FormatThe S90 can capture images in JPEG and RAW format. Anyone who is serious or even semi-serious in photography should know how to manipulate images in the RAW format. (Note: there is an option to capture every image in *both* RAW and JPEG.)RAW vs. JPEG : RAW is an uncompressed and unaltered image as captured by the camera. JPEG is compressed, and the image quality is reduced as a result.RAW is one of the main selling points of this camera. A vast majority of point-and-shoot cameras do not have the ability to capture pictures in RAW format whereas ALL DSLR's are able to capture images in RAW format. Most point-and-shoot cameras save the captured images as JPEG (.jpg) format.RAW allows post processing. With the right software, you can create stunning images! To learn more about RAW, here's a list of books:(1) Raw Workflow from Capture to Archives: A Complete Digital Photographer's Guide to Raw Imaging (Paperback), (2) Real World Camera Raw with Adobe Photoshop CS4, (3) Camera Raw with Photoshop For Dummies.- Compact SizeWell, isn't that the whole point of a point-and-shoot/compact camera? The S90 fits comfortably in the the size of your palm. The S90 will fit in your shirt pocket.

While you can use this as a point and shot camera in auto mode, this camera is far more. It features a larger imaging sensor than most point and shots.  Actually the same as the Canon G11 series. It also features Canon's Digic 4 processor, their latest and greatest. It has far more control options and adjustments you can make. On the front of the camera, the lens sticks out about a quarter of an inch (even when closed). Where it sticks out is a control ring that you can set to do different things, such as zoom the lens, change the ISO, exposure compensation, etc. One thing you might notice is you don't see a flash on the front. The S90 has a flash that pops up when needed. Works pretty well as long as your subject isn't farther than about 12 feet (normal for this size camera). A mode dial on the top lets you chose between manual mode, a few auto modes, scene modes, and a custom mode (you define the settings). The S90 features a large 3\" LCD on the back that is very bright. I work well in sunlight, a good thing since it doesn't doesn't have an opticl viewfinder. The viewfinders are going to be a thing of the past for these size camera.One thing the S90 has that almost no point and shoot has is the ability to shoot RAW. This means that it saves the data from the sensor directly to the memory card without the camera processing it. When an image is processed, some data is \"destroyed\". The cameras sensor has a wider range than the PC or print can display. When processed, the camera decides which data to keep (and Canon's Digic chip is very good at this). However there are some situations that fool the camera and don't give you the best picture. If you shoot RAW, you get to make the decision when you process it in your computer. You will need software that can handle Canon RAW files (Lightroom, Photoshop, etc). The good news is that Canon includes their DPP (Digital Photo Pro) software. This software is very, very good. I like to shoot RAW & Jpeg (the camera saves both to the memory card at the same time). I use the Jpeg pictures unless I have one that doesn't look so good, then I use DPP to process the RAW file. I can then uually get a better image.For more technical details go to [...] and look up the S90.The bad things...There are a couple of problems with the S90:1. One is it can be a little slippery if you're holding it with one hand. Very easy to drop. However, a company named Lensmate sells an add on grip that does not really add to the size of the camera and really  makes it easy to hold. It's a little pricey ($32.00) but it's machined out of aluminum, is light, and looks like it's part of the camera.  If you buy this camera, buy this grip.2. There's a second control ring on the back and it's very easy to accidentally move it and change a camera setting as it sits right under your thumb. Lensmate sells a little Delron ring (about $5.00) that goes around it and keeps your thumb just off of the control ring. Push down and you can rotate the ring to change settings. Anoither good thing to have.The best things:1. The picture quality is fantastic for this size camera. I've made 13x19 prints and they are great!2. It's size. Since you can carry it in a pocket, it can go everywhere.Bottom line... I sold my G11.

If you are looking at if for that reason paired with the Canon case, you will not be disappointed.The final straw in my decision process was will this be my only camera?  If the answer for you is yes it is, and having the smallest camera possible isn't a huge issue, then I would recommend going with the G11.  The optic viewfinder is very important in serious outdoor photography and the better zoom too.  The G11 is more rugged and at least for guys, fits better in the hands.

I have had it a few weeks. I bought it because of reviews that I had read and because on my previous overseas excursions I brought the cumbersome Nikon D70. I had never been interested in a 'point and shoot' camera before because of what I perceived as the lack of controls for shutter speed and f stop. Now, I am travelling and it is truly a pleasure and joy to have it strapped on my belt almost all of the time. I have now shot about 300 images.What 'sold' me on this one was also the high regard in the reviews that I read for the special 'low light' setting. It really does enable the photographer to shoot in low light situations and although there is typical color shifts, the resolution and lack of pixalation is quite good. It is very cool to have that option. Also, it is very small and Canon makes a case that is perfect to strap on your belt. It is so light and easy to carry that I bring it with me day and night.I had read many previous reviews that thought the 'wheel' control on the back of the camera was too loose and that it may change your settings too easily. At first, I thought this may be true but after some experimentation, I realized it was a genius design if you use \"Manual\" setting and also for flipping thru your saved photos and viewing them.The beauty of the wheel is that when you are shooting in Manual mode, you can spin the wheel to control the shutter speed. This allows you to look at the image and see it progress from light to dark or vice a versa. In my experience, the shutter speed doesn't matter as long as you are not shooting moving objects as long as you can control camera 'shake'. The f stop is the creative control for most images and you set that via the control ring around the neck of the lens in the front. Using the control ring for movement frees the photographer from thinking about 'the average meter reading and the plus one minus one, etc. that usually happens with an slr. Then you have to check depth of field and it is at least a two step process to see the effects.If you want to change depth of field, you will have to move the ring in the front, but you can see the effects right away and you can easily change the feeling of light with the 'loose' wheel in the back by changing shutter speeds.The other advantage of the loose wheel in the back is for viewing your saved photos. There are at least two ways to view them. One is by tapping the left side of the wheel to go backward and the right side to go forward. However, by using the wheel and rotating the wheel which moves very easily, you can quickly go thru many photos like you are flipping thru a deck of cards.Another recommended adjunct to the Powershot is the Canon case I purhcased which is specifically for this model camera. If you have a belt on, it slips securely onto the belt and is very easy to open and close. So convenient and compact and solid.The only thing lacking at this point for me is a smooth transition for the zoom lens. I use the control at the top and it is a little jerky and hard to control for exact framing. There may be an alternative method which I haven't discovered yet.This is my first point and shoot and it is a winner.

Took literally 500 shots in all kinds of conditions, including many with suboptimal lighting that would have resulted in mediocre pictures with most other point and shoot cameras.  The S90 took amazingly great pictures indoors, including in poorly lit rooms and rooms with florescent lighting.  It took amazing sunset pictures (using the pre-programmed \"sunset\" mode!).  Completely wide and fully zoomed images looked equally great, less barrel distortion at the widest angle than every other zoom PNS I've used.  Finally, the lag from power-on to first shot and the lag from shot to shot are both better than every other PNS I've owned (but of course much less than the DSLR, which is almost zero lag).I also have a Nikon D60, which I love, but got this Canon PNS because sometimes it's not practical to bring the DSLR.  The S90 truly approaches the Nikon DSLR in image quality in most conditions.  The S90 also gives the photographer a lot more control than most PNS cameras, though novices like me will be producing excellent pictures with just the \"auto\" and the pre-programmed modes.  The image stabilization works transparently in the background and helps improve the quality of shots, especially in low lighting.  Only shot a few movie clips.  They aren't above average quality for PNS cameras (though maybe I could get better quality clips if I learn more about the movie settings).  But at least, you can zoom in/out while shooting movies, something that many other PNSs won't do.I can tell you battery life is great.  I got 300 shots on the first battery.  I could have gotten probably another dozen or so, but swapped it out for a fresh battery so I'd be prepared for any Kodak moments.  But 300 shots on one battery is very realistic, and I did a lot of reviewing between shots.This is my first PNS without an optical viewfinder.  I thought I'd miss it, and I thought battery life would be dismal with the LCD display on almost constantly.  But battery life was great, as noted above, and the LCD display is so bright and clear, I can completely live without the optical viewfinder.I don't think the camera is particularly stylish, though maybe it is in a nerdy photographer kind of way.  And I would have preferred a longer zoom.  But I've got my DSLR for that.  The most important things to me were great image quality in all sorts of lighting conditions, wide angle at the wide end of the zoom, and good battery life.  The Canon S90 delivers on all that and more.  I recommend it very highly.At the moment, it's new and in high demand.  If you can wait a month or two, you'll be able to find it for less - probably even here at Amazon.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Still a really nice camera", "Author": "JM", "ReviewID": "R1SA7XALOT15G8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Even in June 2010 I think this is still the best, or nearly the best, camera you can buy for image quality and control, short of a much larger micro four-thirds or DSLR camera.Short of those cameras, only the Lumix LX3 might have a better lens and take nicer pictures than the S90. In the end I preferred the S90 because it's more pocketable than the LX3. I also tried the Sony WX1-- a really fun camera and unbelievable at night, but less predictable image quality than the S90 in bright light, less customizable, and without the S90's manual controls.I was also interested in the new Sony NEX-3 and NEX-5. But they're only comparable in size when used with their pancake prime lens, which is fixed at an extremely wide angle.Non-issues in my opinion:The ergonomics, including the free-spinning control wheel on the back of the camera, take some getting used to but once I did, I really liked them.Lacks HD video; other cameras zoom more; and not great burst speed: But these are just qualities of the sensor and optics, and you get other good features and qualities in exchange. You can't have everything.Neither the sensor nor the lens are as good quality as a micro four-thirds or DSLR. But the S90 is a lot smaller even than the smallest micro four-thirds, and less expensive.Cons:The S90 does sometimes over-expose in bright light (the Sony WX1 was even worse this way), but only sometimes; and in most modes it's intuitive to quickly adjust this by twirling that control wheel.Can't re-focus while recording a movie (though you can zoom [correction: only digital zoom]).I wish it would display the zoom level on screen, because I enjoy shooting at 50mm equivalent. For no good reason, it only displays this value when you're using the control ring around the lens to zoom, not when you're using the lever around the shutter. Using the control ring isn't appropriate in all modes.Pros:The manual modes are easy and fun to use when you get used to them (and perhaps read the manual to learn some of the more esoteric available features).The auto mode generally works well too. You have a complete range from fully auto to fully manual modes, with everything you could want in between.Lots of ways to customize, including the satisfying \"C\" mode that will always start the camera up with all your favorite startup settings, including zoom level.You can tweak the white balance settings (even auto white balance), for example to be slightly more amber or blue, just by turning the control ring.Has a RAW mode to grow into.Unusually big sensor: bigger than just about any other point-and-shoot, but still smaller than micro four-thirds or DSLR. Improves light sensitivity, image quality, and optics (you can defocus parts of the composition at low f-stops).Fast lens: f2.0 at the widest angle (28mm equivalent) is better than almost any other point-and-shoot, and in fact better than many micro four-thirds and DSLR kit lenses. But note that the lens isn't -as- unusually fast as you zoom in. The S90's max aperture is f3.2 at 50mm equivalent. Still pretty good though (but the LX3 does have the S90 beat here).Between the sensor and the lens, the camera is great indoors. You can take some very nice handheld shots in very dim light indoors or outdoors without flash, and at night using the special night mode which uses pixel binning (increases the sensor's sensitivity by decreasing its resolution). Not impossible-seeming handheld night shots like the Sony WX1's night modes (which rely on some amazing image processing algorithms), but very nice quality like a 35mm film camera with a nice fast lens.Outdoor and bright light shots generally have realistic colors (not washed not, not unrealistically saturated either), and vivid, realistic skies (unless you're shooting into the light, then skies can wash out unless you underexpose-- but that's like pretty much any camera).Quick and responsive-- not blazingly fast like the Sony WX1 or some newer cameras, but still very quick and solid. This sense of responsiveness includes power up, shutter lag, shot-to-shot (helps to turn off the automatic review), interface navigation, auto-focus, and zoom.The interface is generally well thought out. It feels like an \"enthusiast's\" interface.Pocketable, with no separate lens cap. Just pull it out, switch it on, and start taking pictures. Between this and the well thought-out interface, you can be making nice pictures, including the fun and creativity of manual control, without starting your day by packing a lot of photography gear or putting a camera around your neck. It's a great camera for travel, street shots, or events, if you're the kind of person who will enjoy working on making nice pictures in those contexts.In summary, this camera takes consistently great pictures, and can last you a long time as you explore new ways to use it.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid and very competent", "Author": "Robert A.

Digitally I started with a 5 MP Canon in 2000, went to 6, and though I can't remember the model number - maybe simply an S6 - I remember the image quality as being superb - without any image stablization mumbo.  Later I came to conclude that the nature shots of the SD600, which was a gift to my girlfriend, to be the best I'd ever seen from a Point & Shoot camaera - yes, maybe the image stablization really works.Wanting my own camera, I bought a Canon SD1100 which was stolen though with few regrets - the image quality wan't there. Next I tried the Canon 1200, but I just wasn't satified with the crispness.  So I switched brands; I bought a Panasonic DMC-ZS3 with great expectations, but again I was disappointed in the sharpness of the image and in low light performance.  I ended up giving that one away.I had read great things about Fujifilm, so I bought the 200 EXR.  The colors and contrast were excellent, and I considered it acceptable, but it was stolen from my car.  Sold on a longer zoom, I bought the 70 EXR, but even though it shares the same processor with the 200 model, I just wasn't quite happy with image clarity nor with white balance, nor with the graininess of low light shots.  I have to agree with the many opinions I've read - that the 200 and 70 models on EXR mode or Auto jack up the ISO too fast, and the result is noise.  As for the 70 EXR, I recently gave it away.Enter the S90, and I must say that it is by far the best digital camera I've owned.  The colors are the truest that I have seen in a long time, the images are more than acceptably sharp, and the low light performance is truly impressive.  Finally I have found a P&S; camera (which I want for portability) that I am happy with in every aspect.  Reading through the tons of camera reviews, I've come to realize a couple things: 1) a huge number of 5-star ratings doesn't mean squat - individual preferences, refined or not, rule the day; and 2) I had been duped by the propaganda that more pixels are better.In looking at the images from the 10 MP S90, I realize that the MP war is misguided, and what should be better disclosed is not only MP's but also the size (area) of the processor.  Then there's the quality of the lense.  The S90 has a bigger processor than most P&S; cameras, not to mention a brighter lense.

I much prefer to shoot RAW than JPEG.Given that there are very few compact cameras shooting RAW that are able to fit in my small belt pouch (to be with me nearly all the time), those were key features for me.  I typically use the X-Rite ColorChecker Passport to do custom color profiles from RAW files in Adobe Lightroom and now can use that with this Canon camera for precise color in any lighting conditions.I'd probably read more than 8 online reviews of the S90 before buying it, so I was aware of criticism of it for its dial on the back being too easily turned. I didn't find that a problem at all.Some found the camera too slippery. That had some truth to it, so I improved the ergonomics of the camera with an extra, custom-made grip from [...]. (I never use the tiny strap that comes with compact cameras.) That made it *much* easier to hold.Having been in photography 47 years now, I'm astounded at the features in this camera (including some I'll never use, which apply only if you shoot JPEGs). It's definitely higher tech than the older SD870 IS which I decided not to get fixed after it broke, but to replace with this camera.I find the meter on this camera extremely accurate, with rarely any need to override it.Some critics online have faulted it for lacking an optical viewfinder, but I'd much prefer to have a 3\" LCD on the back than a smaller LCD and tiny, squinty, optical viewfinder combination.I've pored through the manual to understand all the camera can do and configure it to suit the way I use it. Having manual settings, histograms while shooting, and lots more is terrific. I'm very glad for its f2 lens (and don't really care about the limitations of its flash as I rarely use a camera's built-in flash).I'm very glad for the high quality even at higher ISOs, partly due its having the larger sensor of its brother (much larger, heavier, not pocketable), the Canon G11.It *would* have been nice to have HD video (or optical zooming while filming), but I didn't buy the camera so much for video features.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best choice for me.", "Author": "TLS", "ReviewID": "R2YB1C43DZGP6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After weeks if not months of thinking about and reviewing many, many models I selected the Canon s90 because it is, in my opinion, the best choice for maximum usage and flexibility.  My original preference and search template lead me to start with a Digital SLR but, I knew my needs and most consistent use would be closer to the point and shoot offerings.  There are many excellent models and the competition is keen.  However an SLR is rather large for all occasions.  Add an extra lens or two then you have a backpack sized bundle.  The point and shoots are cool, user friendly and credit card compact but, they are somewhat limited regarding optics and range.  Image quality and the ability to control conditions are preferences that usually swing in favor of SLR but, the s90 allows equal to superior performance in a point and shoot small package.  Low light without flash at low ISO is highly desirable.  The s90 is awesome and dominates the field in low light, natural settings inside and out.  The f2.0 lens is not found in any SLR kit lens or set.  You'll easily pay more than $500 for that option for any SLR.  Great shots happen many times when you are not looking for them and almost always when an SLR would likely be at home.  The s90 lets me keep it handy all the time.  Not as slim and sleek as most point and shoots but, fits easily in a jacket or cargo pocket.  I found that a quick released lanyard connected to the camera's wrist strap is a perfect setup.  Shop for yourself, determine your need and best use but, for me the s90 is the one.  IMPORTANT:  the LCD screen WILL scratch easily.  A $5-6.00 package of clear plastic cut to fit screen savers is an absolute must and should be applied out of the box as one more step the setup routine.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot even if pricey.", "Author": "L.

You know who you are. Your camera is the size of a medium rock, and in all likelihood is carried around your neck to complete that professional photographer look. you have trouble trusting others to take a photo for you because you feel like they'll drop it, and in turn strangers off the street have no idea how to hold it or even work it.However if you're like me, and hate to lug large cameras around your neck like some heifer and you just want a camera to accurately take pictures that reflect what you see.

I feel like no camera I've tried out before has the same ability to take the picture that I actually see with my own eyes in these dark conditions.And of course it works great during the day too.Yeah I realize it's pricey if you're shopping for a point and shoot when you can easily snag one for $100, but those cameras aren't going to be nearly as versatile in capturing as many moments in as many conditions as you want it to.

Here's why:- Shoots RAW. Images are uncompressed and much more amenable to postprocessing than Jpgs.- 1/2 the pixel density as cheaper cams. This means higher sensitivity, lower noise, or better colors (one at a time)- DSLR- type handling, with a A/Tv/M knob and 2 rings (1 on the lens -very cool-, 1 on the back)If you come from a DSLR background, as did I, you might at first not know where to put your fingers without obstructing something, and perhaps balk a little at all the tweaks and settings necessary to beat this camera into accepting your parameters. But eventually, I predict, you'll love how everything is there, somewhere, and admire what a good job the LCD is doing as a viewfinder substitute. The one aspect in which the S90 looks inferior to its DSLR siblings, is its speed: don't expect more than 1/2 fps, never mind the fact it has the same CPU as the high end 8 fps SLRs (insert your own marketing ploy here...)Scuba divers will find this camera a particular gem. Like for its other compacts, Canon makes an underwater case for a (relatively) low price; the entire contraption (S90, Case & weights) costs about half of what a bare DSLR case goes for. The ability to set the whitepoint on the RAW pictures is priceless for the red- deprived underwater world. If you prefer to shoot in jpg, there is an underwater scene, although I found it adds too much red to pictures taken in shallow water.Sadly, the S90 lacks an HD movie mode. According to lots of internet rants, this is no firmware oversight, but a limitation of the sensor used (same as in the G11). Granted, I do prefer the RAW and extra image quality to HD movies, but in this day and age, why is that a choice? The less expensive S9xx series have 720p movies (which is three times the resolution that the S90 is capable of), and DSLRs have 1080p movies now (SIX times the resolution of the S90), so the old \"this is a camera not a toy\" line of 2007 doesn't work anymore. Therefore, even though this is a solid, versatile, practical tool, I'm subtracting 1 star for that.UPDATE: Canon announced the S95 on August 19th. Guess what?

After a few weeks of shopping, I finally bought a Canon S90. This little gem is amazing! It takes great pictures in low light, I enjoy the large LCD screen on the back, and the picture quality is stunning for a point and shoot. I have a few jealous friends who were surprised by the quality of pictures I was able to take, especially compared to their cameras. Having photographic bragging rights is nice. The creative abilities you have with the manual controls of this camera were a deal-maker for me. I work with DSLRs a lot, and having a large amount of those manual controls on a DSLR in a small, take-everywhere package was the most important reason I bought this camera. While one obviously cannot expect this to take pictures on quite the same level as a DSLR, the pictures are certainly superior to any camera I've seen of this size and price range on the market. The weight is nice, it feels really sturdy. The control ring on the front is a nice feature. I was worried it was going to be gimmicky, but it's actually well designed. The other ring on the back doesn't get in my way and I don't have problems taking pictures with one hand. Just be careful to keep the wrist strap on, it can get a bit slippery. The customizable button the back is really nice. I set it to turn off the screen so I could save battery life between shots. The flash itself is great, it lights up a dark room nicely. Color swap/accent are nifty little features to have, also.Some things I don't like about this camera (unfortunately, it could not be perfect...) are the shutter release and main zoom control because it feels too plasticy for the $400 price tag. Everything else is fairly solid. Also the battery life leaves something to be desired. I did get about 450 shots on one charge, but the actual time spent shooting was short. I am buying a second battery to carry around with me. The camera is slightly larger than most point and shoots and it took me a while to find a case that properly fit without paying a fortune. I don't think it's as sleek looking as other Canons, but I understand that's entirely subjective. The flash can be intrusive. It's right where I put my finger. Thankfully, it comes up really forcefully, much stronger than I'm holding the camera so I'm not afraid of breaking it. It's similar to someone rolling a car window up when your arm is still sticking out. You're not going to break the window, but it is a little startling.Overall, if you're shopping for a pocketable camera with superior image quality and more manual control, there is not a better camera out there.

On the other hand, if you're looking for something very simple, small and/or low-cost, then this is not the camera for you.PREFACE:When it comes time to make a big purchase, my husband and I seek out the best of the best. We always do lots of research and read countless reviews. This research has made it clear that in the world of compact point & shoot cameras, Canon stands out above the rest. And right now, the best camera available in this class is the Canon Powershot S90. (For those interested, our favorite trusted camera review sites are: [...] and [...])Why is it the best? There are too many things to list here... Here's a link to a very detailed review:[...].MY REVIEW:For me personally, the most important selling points were:1.) LARGE CCD SENSOR - The sensor is much larger than your typical compact camera sensor, and it is a CCD which is superior to the more commonly found CMOS sensor. Normally you will only find this type of sensor on a digital SLR (DSLR). As a result, the photo quality from this camera rivals that of my Nikon DSLR. The photo quality is spectacular, especially in low light. You really have to see some sample comparison photos to truly appreciate it.2.) CUSTOMIZABLE \"SCENE\" - It has your typical automatic and scene modes, but also has a customizable mode like you will find on DSLRs. This gives you the ability to tweak the settings exactly the way you like them and save them as a separate \"C\" mode - easily accessible on the top dial.3.) CUSTOMIZABLE BUTTON & LENS RING. Have you ever been frustrated with the number of steps required to change certain settings? Well this camera allows you to customize the functions of the \"S\" button and the ring around the lens so you can set up easy shortcuts to the settings/features you use most often. Personally, I use the \"S\" button to change shooting mode (single shot vs. continuous vs. timer), and I use the lens ring to control exposure compensation (to make photos lighter or darker).4.) LOW LIGHT CAPABILITY - I am usually never happy with the way photos turn out using the flash on a compact camera... The lighting just tends to look unnatural. So whenever possible, I shoot with the flash off. Since this camera handles low light so well, I almost never use the flash. I am just blown away by some of the photos this camera has taken in low light! Again, you have to see it to believe it.5.) HIGH RESOLUTION DISPLAY - With most compact camera displays, when reviewing a photo it's usually hard to tell if the focus was correct, among other things. But the high resolution display on this camera shows excellent detail and reproduces color well, thus giving you a much more accurate preview of the photo.Some downsides to note:1.) POOR BATTERY LIFE - Just order a few compatible generic batteries and always keep a charged spare in your camera case. I do this with all of my cameras, regardless of their battery life. There's nothing worse than having a fantastic photo opportunity and a dead battery!2.) POOR ERGONOMICS - When holding the camera in your right hand, your index finger falls naturally on the mode selection dial, not the shutter. This can be annoying, but as you use the camera more, your muscle memory puts your finger in the right place. Also, it's really easy to turn the lens ring, thus changing the outcome of your photo. I have found no resolution to this problem other than to be careful.3.) SIZE/SHAPE - It's a little less compact than many of the compact cameras available these days. However, it has to be larger to fit the big sensor in there, so I'm willing to make that sacrifice. Also, the fact that the lens sticks out makes it a bit awkward to fit in certain cases or to tuck away into a purse or pocket.Overall, I am thrilled with this camera! It continues to amaze me and give me that giddy \"I LOVE this thing!\" feeling. :)", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "A point and shoot for the DSLR guy", "Author": "Greenkiwi \"gk\"", "ReviewID": "R6MHWWHO5ZB2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of having two cameras, a little tiny point and shoot (Canon SD1000) and a full DSLR, I was finding myself getting more and more frustrated with the P&S;, basically, I stopped taking it with me because the pictures it took were generally just \"snapshots\".

Little in size but pretty big in features and picture quality. I also invested in the belt loop Canon leather carrying case and I have this camera with me wherever I go. So far (I've had it a few months) it's doing an excellent job. I shoot in raw (larger file size) and process in Lightroom 2 but it will certainly shoot in jpeg also. The quality is really good (even cranked up to ISO 800). It shoots well in low light. It doesn't have any extreme zoom to it but it's sufficient for most any need. I find that as small as it is, in my shaky hands, I couldn't steady it very well if it zoomed any more than it already does. I have also invested in a monopod for it and that really helps with steadying it. It does have the anti shake feature that most cameras have, but I'm pretty shaky and needed a little more (or else I have to adjust up the shutter speed). Not to mention that it's handy to be able to hold the monopod out in front of me and take my wife's and my picture in whatever setting we happen to be in (I put a small ballhead on the monopod) so I could adjust the camera to whatever angle I needed to get our self portrait shots. That's pretty nice!! Just set the timer and smile!!!The features are nice, it's picture quality is great, and it truly gives you total control if you want it (Manual). For those that don't care to learn the bells and whistles, it has a lot of modes that allow you to just preset and shoot and let the camera do the imaging. Since photography is a big hobby of mine, I'm enjoying learning it's features and are shooting more and more in manual. I like being able to tell the camera what I want instead of just letting it decide for me. I'm certainly still learning but so far I'm very pleased. In my research, I looked closely at the Canon G11 which, in my opinion, had one other feature I liked which was a hot shoe to be able to put an external flash on (or put on a pocket wizard and set up the flash somewhere else), but my main concern was having the portability. I chose this camera because I can keep it with me and that's worth more to me than having to carry a larger camera. If I want to do that, I'll take my DSLR with me. The S90 has a small pop up flash that is adequate for most needs. I'll have to admit that it takes some getting used to where to put your fingers when holding the camera as the pop up flash pops up right where you tend to want to hold it (top left hand corner from behind the camera). I had read about that quite a bit in other reviews. They're right! But it's not insurmountable to get past. I have experimented some with the small flash and found that (1) you can adjust the amount of flash coming out of it and that helps in toning down the flash for just a fill flash on a sunny day and (2) If you lay a napkin or the end of a handkerchief over the little flash that pops up, it really softens the light that comes out of it.My wife and I are going on a cruise later this year and I really wanted something I could take along easily without carrying a bunch of camera gear with me. I think this is going to do the job just fine. Not to mention I've gotten some great impromptu shots just going back and forth to work. I have no idea how sturdy this camera is or how long it will last in the day to day world, but so far so good.I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to have that camera with them that goes beyond what a cell phone will do (at least at this point in time). With technology, who knows huh? The nice thing about it is, if you want just a point and shoot, it's here and if you want to continue to grow and learn more about it's features and other tricks you can do with it, it's capable of that too. The best of both worlds!!Enjoy!!! Hope this helps some!12 21 2010  Still doing a great job! I've (gasp) dropped it onto concrete once. Still taking great pics!!! I really like the flexibility and the features. No regrets whatsoever with this little camera!

It is very compact and yet has a full range of features that allow a photographer to experiment and refine the picture.  I like to tinker with the settings, but other members of my family like the automatic setting that allows them to point and shoot.  This camera satisfies all.The best features, among many, are the control ring around the lens and another on the back that can be assigned various functions; this is just brilliant--so easy to use and yet so powerful.  Others have mentioned accidentally shifting a setting because they touched the back ring by mistake; I have not had this experience at all and find the controls very nicely placed and spaced.  That front ring is a wonder--so easy to make a quick adjustment to a picture.The f/2 setting and the low light capabilities of this camera are stunning.  I have used the flash once inside, and that just to see what it would do.  Most of the time it isn't needed, and the natural light pictures are just beautiful.  I've been using a Canon S2 IS for a few years, and before that I had a Canon AE-1 film camera.  The S90's pictures remind me of the pictures I could capture with my old 35mm camera.  Granted, the S90 isn't an SLR, but I didn't want the size and expense of one of those--I'd rather have the portability and simple power of this camera right now.  The sensor on the S90 captures lovely photographs that confirm my decision with every picture I take.I had been looking at the G-series when this camera came out.  The S90 has the versatility of those cameras, but it is so sleek and easy to carry that I'm going to get many, many more pictures than I would with any other camera.  Very highly recommendededit: Just returned from a vacation that included several days in museums.  This camera is ideal for museum pictures where you cannot use the flash and the light is often low or minimal.  I got every shot I wanted, and the camera pleasantly surprised me with the images even in the most challenging of situations through glass cases and under very low light.  I used to have to take pictures for my kids because they could not hold cameras steady enough inside to get the shot; but this camera is so good in low light that anyone can capture inside pictures without a flash. The wide lens helped me capture items and galleries in very tight spaces, and the many manual adjustments helped compensate for different kinds of light and effects I sought.

I've had a DSLR since the first generation Rebel; but, found I rarely used it due to its physical size. I mainly take pictures during my travels and preferred a small camera which I could fit in my pocket.  Over the years I went through a half-dozen digital Canon Powershots (mid line), replacing then as new ones were released with improved capabilities. The Powershot pictures never really came out as good as a DSLR and I missed the creative modes (TV, AV, M, etc.).  The S90 provides a lot of features and capabilities typical of a DSLR in a point & shoot format; however, it's not a DSLR replacement.  I looked at the Canon G11 and Panasonic DMC-LX3.  The G11 got ruled out due to its larger size; the LX3 because of my familiarity with Canon camera menus and software.There are many positive reviews which I share on the technical merits, features, and capabilities of the camera.  I mainly have three pet peeves with the camera. (1) Placement of the pop-up flash, which regularly hits my left index finger when it rises.  (2) Sometimes I find it confusing to recall the purpose of lens control ring versus the dial ring on the back of the camera.

So after reading all the wonderful reviews, I went out and bought the S90. After several hundred photos, however, this camera is going back. Many great things have been said about this camera so there's no need for me to highlight those here. Instead, I'll point out the weaknesses...1. The rear dial floats too freely. It often makes changes to the settings that you didn't intend. Also, the dial controls a different function depending on what shooting mode you're on so sometimes the change will be small enough that you don't catch it (until it's too late).2. The F2.0 lens allows for MUCH better low-light shooting. Unfortunately, in some situations where my Canon SD800 would have used a flash 100% of the time, the S90 still won't use the flash and I end up with many blurred images. You can switch over to manual settings to force the flash but you can't do it from the auto shooting mode.3. The surface is very slippery and feels like a bar of soap. Richard Franiec came out with a very nice grip which retails for $33. Unfortunately, you can't use it with the Canon PSC-900 case that was designed specifically for this camera. Also, am I the only one bothered by having to spend another $33 just to have a decent grip?4. The flash position is terrible as I'm constantly putting my left index finger over it. Having my finger there, I have jammed the flash on many occasions as it was popping up (you don't always know when the camera will decide to use the flash). The flash would only come up part way and the only resolution is to turn off your camera and turn it back on again. This only takes a few seconds but you can miss some good shots that way.5. The NB-6L battery pack, despite being almost identical in size to the NB-5L (of which I own two), provides almost 20% fewer shots according to Canon specifications and my own personal experience. If you're like me and like taking multiple shots of everything so you can weed out the duds later, you'll need to get a second battery which retails for $60.6. No HD video. This is everyone's main gripe but it bears mentioning.This has not discouraged me from buying Canon and I'm anxiously awaiting the follow-up to the S90.

I also own the SD-880, which is a great compact digital in its own right, but the S90 really brings in some capabilities and features I enjoy using.  The two best things about this camera are the dedicated control rings on the front (think traditional aperture spinner like on a SLR or rangefinder lens) and back.  The other great  feature is having a 28mm f/2.0 equivalent lens in a pocket sized camera.I've been able to take some really good pictures with this camera in the past week, some of my family and some nature and cityscapes, all of which were easy to do with the quick operation and easy adjustability the interface provides.I like to use the C mode (for custom) where the camera will save my favorite settings.  So for me, C mode means Program and Auto ISO with Macro mode enabled and where the front ring adjust exposure compensation and the back ring can take ISO out of Auto and into the ISO I choose.

I'm infinitely more likely to have the S90 with me than my Nikon D3, which takes great pics, but is a beast to lug around for amateur use.This is still of course no substitute for a SLR, which is going to give you better autofocus for action and much better noise at higher ISOs among other things, but I just don't think you can find a better \"camera that's with you\" than the Canon S90.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing, but not quite $430 amazing", "Author": "H2", "ReviewID": "R2M8E7K8TV6N8E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The holy grail for digital camera manufacturers is to capture the space between compact point and shoot and full size DSLR.

Designing for this space is all about trade-offs, and this makes the S90 the camera that I loved and hated, and ultimately returned.Pros:-best picture quality for a point and shoot.

I saw a G11 the other day and was lusting after the dedicated ISO and exposure dials.Ultimately, I was hoping to get DSLResque performance in a compact and easy to use camera.  While the S90 is compact and DSLResque in picture quality, ease of use is (understandably) significantly less than that of a full sized DSLR.

Seligman", "ReviewID": "R2BO5HTG0ATWJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've fallen in love with a camera!The Canon S90 is 2009's  best of the smaller digital cameras for those who highly value a 28 mm wide lens, superb low light capability, manual control of shutter and aperture, and RAW capability.  There are numerous bonuses, such as the two programmable rings, and a third programmable button, for fast control of things like focus, exposure, ISO,  or white balance, instead of  scrolling through a hodge podge of menus. If you want a 10x zoom, interchangeable lenses, or a larger camera for your grip, look elsewhere.I don't like using flash, and the f 2.0 lens and superb high ISO resolution is wonderful. I took photos in a very dim restaurant of friends and  my food, and the photos are clean and fairly noise free at ISO 800, and quite good at  ISO 1600. Photos at 3200 are surprisingly good if shooting in dim light, not darkness. If you blow them up, sure you'll see noise, however on my wide screen monitor, they are quite good. The photos at 1600 and 3200 are not the quality of a new higher end Digital SLR, however at this ISO, they are far, far better than any other \"point and shoot\" sized camera to date. To be fair, the  S90's chip is a small fraction of the size of an APC or even full frame sensor chip, and thus does a wonderful job in low light. The S90  does \"drop\" image size to about 1.3 Megapixels to get the  ISO  3200 photo if light's truly dim. This is a minor drawback to some, not if  having \"a decent\" photo is far better than \"no\" photo to you.The LCD screen is large and bright. Focusing is easy. Overall picture quality, colr and macro photography are superb. The antishake  stabilizes  well-I take photos at 1/6 second, and letters on a menu in low light are sharp-slower speeds  than that and I brace my arms or camera.  While point and shoot cameras can take a few seconds between exposures, the S90 has a \"continuous\" setting in the \"candle\" low light mode and in \"P\" mode, that, as long as your finger presses the shutter button down, it lets you take numerous  photos slightly faster than every second, for over a dozen photos, if in decent light.One drawback-the expensive Canon OEM battery only gives ~200 shots. Canon should put in a more powerful battery. Some cheaper off brand NB-6L compatible batteries offer 1300 mAH instead of Canon's 1000 mAh  NB-6L, and folks have been happy with those batteries in other Canon cameras. 300 more mAh means 30% greater capacity, not a different voltage. Whether you buy Canon OEM, or another brand, it's best to have two batteries with you. Sometimes 3 batteries as a safety factor if you use the flash a bit,  take videos, and will be unable to charge up for a while, Play it safe if you are at a wedding, or once in a lifetime event. Another minor drawback-the back adjustment ring is looser than I'd like, as it can be moved too easily and change settings if you are not vigilant. The front ring around the lens is a dream to work with.I  use the Nikon D80 and D90 for serious work, and used to keep the Canon SD 850 in my pocket for photos anywhere, anytime. I am often indoors in low light , and the S90 trounces the SD850's mediocre ISO 400 and up performance. My S90 stays in hard carrying case on my pant's belt.

I happened to be browsing a recent B&H; catalog and noticed the Olympus E-P2 - very attractive retro look! Started reading up on it (especially the outstanding information on [...]) and decided I had to see one of these in the flesh. Found one at a local store, and while it's gorgeous, it's nowhere near as compact as I imagined from the catalog photo. And it has no viewfinder (Casio does) and no flash! But it has a large image sensor and apparently amazing image quality. So I got to thinking: what else is out there that can do better than my beautiful little Casio? I've always lamented its lack of RAW images, and eventually it will break, but pretty much everything about it is incredible. So my research turned up these cameras (data largely gathered from [...], with additional info from manufacturers' websites):Camera || Sensor size || Aperture || Focal length || FlashCanon PS S90 || .43 cm2 || f/2.0 || 28-105mm || YesOlympus E-P2 || 2.43 cm2 || f/2.8* || 17mm* || NoPanasonic LX3 || .45 cm2 || f/2.0 || 24-60mm || YesSigma DP2 || 2.85 cm2 || f/2.8 || 24mm || Yes* The Olympus camera has interchangeable lens; the 17mm F/2.8 was the fastest \"normal\" lens that fits my needs.The Panasonic's lens is a Leica that's very highly regarded.The Canon S90 is, by far, the most compact of the cameras in this group. The Olympus could never be considered a pocket camera. The Panasonic is somewhat larger than the Canon, though perhaps still \"pocketable\". The Sigma is really too large for a pocket, though quite a bit more compact than the Olympus.All of these cameras have RAW mode. None of them has an integral viewfinder (not many subcompact P&S; cameras do, anymore, but I still like them for when the sun is shining directly on the LCD).I ruminated about all of this for quite a while before settling on the Canon. Its lens is excellent, the image sensor is the .43cm2 size (1/1.7\") of the best-in-class subcompact P&S; cameras, and it has RAW image mode. The other cameras were all larger - enough to be the deciding factor for me. But I really do like the idea of the very large sensor - eventually someone will offer a camera closer to my wishes, but there isn't one around at the present time.Concerning the camera itself: there's little need to repeat what's already been said very well by others. I've compared the JPEG images to my Casio (which is probably the best I've seen on any camera for color balance, saturation, etc.) and they're just as good. I haven't seen a P&S; that does better. But having RAW image recording opens up a world of processing that's not possible with the Casio. There's some barrel distortion, but it's no worse than on any other camera with a similar lens (and marginally better than the Casio, which can be fairly annoying). And, for the desperate, this can be corrected with PhotoShop and other software.My only real complaints have been voiced numerous times by others: the rear control dial looseness and the flash location.The control dial on the rear of the camera is outrageously loose. It's virtually impossible to use the camera in any mode but fully automatic without inadvertantly changing whatever setting the dial controls for the chosen mode (the dial does nothing in full automatic). In fact, the entire control assembly of which it's a part is so poorly designed as to be an utter anomaly in Canon cameras. How on earth could they not notice such a shortcoming before releasing the product? Nevertheless, I knew about this and had even tried the camera in a store, and it still didn't deter me from buying it. But it will be a constant nuisance. No doubt Canon will eventually get around to addressing this, but as it can't be fixed by a firmware update, those of us who bought this camera are stuck with it.Second, the location of the pop-up flash is absurd: it's at the top left front corner of the camera, exactly where my left index finger is all the time! I've had the camera for exactly two days, and I can't count the number of times that the damn thing decided  to pop up (since it's usually preferable to leave the flash in automatic than turned off all the time) and promptly retract after bumping into my finger, with the resulting \"restart camera\" error message. I hope that this doesn't eventually cause the flash mechanism to self-destruct, and, with luck, I may get used to holding the camera differently, but even though I knew about this before buying, it is unexpectedly annoying. Given the size and layout of the camera, it's not an unreasonable location for the flash, but still ...So it's not quite the perfect pocket camera, but for me, it's the best currently available. I really miss a viewfinder, and that control dial and flash are a royal pain. But I finally got my RAW mode on a very compact camera with a good, fast lens and a larger image sensor. So I'll carry both the Casio and the Canon for a while until I decide which one will become the spare. I suspect the Casio might end up in a drawer - unless that dial on the S90 finally drives me crazy.UPDATE 5/24/10After less than 2 weeks, the front control ring stopped working.

I have never been so happy with a camera -- and I've owned quite a few.Right off the bat, the sensor size is larger than on your average P&S; (point and shoot) camera, but the resolution isn't any higher.  This allows the camera to take MUCH better pictures in low light.  And you will be amazed at how good this camera is in low light!  Short of a DSLR camera, it has no equal.In addition, this camera is built for the serious enthusiast.  Full manual controls make it almost like having a DSLR in your pocket!  And there is a control dial plus a control ring -- making it much easier to control your settings.  Plus, a fast lens and the ability to shoot in RAW ... no wonder so many photographers consider this the best pocket camera available.  And yet, you can keep it in Auto mode and treat it like any other point & shoot.Oh, and the LCD is truly beautiful!The main thing that keeps it from being \"perfect\" in my estimation is the limited zoom: less than 4X.  I need much more zoom.  But I'd give it all up for this camera!  And, if you want to use the camera as a camcorder, the standard definition video mode is a bit disappointing.  Why not high-def, Canon?The main problems with the camera are pretty minor.  The control dial on the back is very loose and you have to be careful not to accidentally change your settings.  It's also a shame that you can't independently set the control dial and control ring for whatever you want: instead, you have to choose among a number of pre-sets.  It's a little disappointing.  And, if you are very serious, it's worth noting the serious barrel distortion in RAW; but the camera takes care of that in processing JPEGs, so most will never know.Some people complain about the build quality.  Trust me, it's perfectly fine.  It's light, which can be misleading.  But there's nothing wrong with the build quality.  Perhaps they expect more for $400.  I guess I can understand that.

Can't recommend this highly enough... and yes, worth the hefty price-tag.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I really want to give this camera 5 stars, but...", "Author": "Matthew Sutton", "ReviewID": "R31SLXMKG5XGQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a month ago or more after almost buying the G11, and have taken about a thousand photos with it so far.I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers. Even love the minimal black design of it. I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults. Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning. The included software is necessary however to convert the raw CR2 files into Tiff files for Photoshop. Bundled with the included software is a PhotoStitch program that allows you to 'stitch' individual shots together to make panormas. Very cool.I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is. There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is. It even brackets.The real disappointment here is the build quality. I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy. An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic. The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it. While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism. The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed. Again not using the flash makes this a non-issue for me, I'd be just as happy if Canon left the flash off entirely or at least integrated it into the body to simplify the design.Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me. I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge. A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that. If you were taking this camera on an extended trip to some remote locale a spare battery would be a necessity.As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so. When you're in a hurry to catch something that can feel like a long delay.Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket. There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis. Hopefully somebody at Canon is checking these product reviews and the next generation S90 will feel like the smooth, solidly-built slab of metal the older PowerShots were.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best pocket-sized camera yet", "Author": "The Thinker", "ReviewID": "R1XSG4A3F0BIX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based upon David Pogue's review online. If you are considering buying this camera, I suggest you read his review too. I wanted a camera that would take excellent pictures indoors without flash. This camera does that very well -- much better than my last camera, which I thought was good. I wanted a camera with a wide-angle lens to capture everything indoors. This camera does that very well. I was relatively unconcerned about full manual control of aperture, shutter speed, etc. But I have discovered that the user interface on this camera makes it so easy to dial-in the settings I want that I am now using manual control for all my pictures, getting the best pictures ever, and loving every minute of it. Although the camera is slightly thicker around the lens than my last camera, I can still easily put this camera in my pants pocket.I have had to use every camera I have owned for a while to get so familiar with the controls that I don't have to think about them. That is true for this camera too. But the wonderful thing is that the more I use the camera, the more I discover about the features it offers and how easy it is to use them. For example, I recently learned that I can choose an alternate set of display characteristics that are accessible with the push of a button. I have chosen to have the screen divided into thirds horizontally and vertically, making it easier to attractively compose pictures. And I can turn this on or off with the push of a button. Some things that initially seemed awkward now seem to work very well.One great thing about this camera that I have not seen in other reviews is that it remembers the way I want it to work. For example, I choose to have the flash turned off all the time as my normal way of operating. This camera remembers that. My last camera required me to manually turn off the flash every time I turned on the camera, which was annoying, and I occasionally forgot to do this, with irritating consequences. It's wonderful to have this camera ready to go as soon as I turn it on.I've used the camera to take pictures of people playing basketball and pictures at night using long exposures and a tripod.  I've been very happy with the flexibility of this camera.One peculiar thing is that when the camera is set to automatically control the exposure, it seems that my efforts to increase or decrease the exposure by a couple of F stops do not have as great an effect as I would expect -- as if the camera is trying to keep me out of trouble. In some cases, this was frustrating, but I am now using full manual choice of the settings, so it is no problem.Another peculiar thing is that sometimes the image on the screen is darker when I shoot the picture than when I view the picture after it has been shot. I am learning to compensate for this, and it is not a serious problem, but I think Canon could improve this a bit.In general, this camera takes wonderful pictures easily and automatically, and it is also very easy to manually control -- it just takes some time and practice to get familiar with it. The more I use it, the better I like it. People who look at the pictures I take are usually blown away by them.

The best ones of that first batch were at ISO 320 with a flash, so there's probably a bit more performance in there.  The ISO 800 shots were smooth and pretty noise-free, though a bit soft by comparison, obviously. Still, very usable.  We have a DSLR and use a point-and-shoot for snapshots, but this thing seriously threatens the utility of our DSLR.So far the ergonomic problems I've heard others bring up haven't caused us any problems.

However, I need to tell prospective buyers that the negatives I've read about this camera must not apply to me, because I haven't found any valid ones yet.  Take battery life, for example.  I bought an extra battery because a few reviewers thought the battery life this camera turns in wasn't very good.  And they may be right if you typically take 200 exposures or more on your photo junkets.  I rarely take more than fifteen or twenty pictures in the course of a day, even out in Yellowstone, and I'm totally satisfied with the battery life the S90 turns in.Some people complained about the daisy control on the back of the camera being too loose.  I haven't found it to be a problem.  Some people thought the zoom was too short, but this isn't a wildlife camera.  This is a \"put it in your pocket and take it along camera\", and it is small enough that you can take it anywhere and almost forget you have it...until you need it or want it.Perhaps people who want a manufacturer to make a product specifically for them will have problems with this camera's layout. It's a very small camera. But if you're at all adaptable, this little gem is worth every penny.  The only thing I have had to get used to is the placement of the flash; and I  don't know where else you would put it except where it is.

Before buying the camera I went to a local camera shop here in Chicago to compare the s90 with the lx3.  First let me say that both are great cameras.  The reason I ultimately decided to buy the canon was its manual features, I love the control ring, RAW, I liked the lens better on the canon because it is more versatile  than the lx3, the low light pictures that it takes are sensational, and it is small enough to fit in most pants pockets.  The only negative about the camera is that it doesn't shoot video in 720p only standard definition video.  For me I bought the camera to take pictures not shoot a ton of videos so I don't care.  The lx3 however does shoot hd video and also costs $75 to $100 more depending on where you decide to buy your camera.  The build quality of the camera is very solid and well put together.

I wouldn't blow them up to poster size, but at 6x4 they are just great.  Even when the flash fired, the pictures were better than that obtained from my ageing G7.Undoubtedly my 40D SLR is better, with much faster focusing and shutter response, but the S90 was no slouch, which frankly surprised me, but remember, it is not meant to replace an SLR, but let you take great photos at times where carrying full kit is not convenient.Although I have seen some complain about build quality, mine is fine... no \"clicking\" plastic behind the flash.  Although its compactness does make me think that it might not survive the 4 foot drop onto concrete that my G7 survived!SO WHY ONLY 4 STARS?... A compact camera needs to make taking photographs painless.  I want to change settings and know that that next time I take a photo, that those settings are the same.However the rear control wheel is VERY sensitive.  There is no click stop resistance to it, and unless you are in 'Auto\" mode, it is always active.  In most modes, this wheel controls exposure compensation, meaning that if do not check before you take EVERY photo, the chances are that the exposure compensation has been accidently changed.I have mitigated some of this frustration by changing the front control ring to alter exposture, meaning the rear wheel automatically changes to setting ISO sensitivity.  However I found I took four photos yesterday at 3200 ISO becasue I knocked the wheel without checking.This is a potential software fix.  Canon just need to to set an additional option for the customizable shortcut button to enable it to toggle locking or unlocking of the control wheel...

This is my first digicam with RAW capability, and I immediately noticed the flexibility in adjusting things such as white balance, exposure, colors, etc on the RAW image versus a JPEG. I use Adobe Lightroom 2 by the way. Note that you need to use at least the program mode to be able to capture pictures in RAW. On the auto-mode, you only have the option to capture in JPEG. So better read a bit of the manual instead of relying on the auto-mode. The RAW capability is worth it.2. Very good/big sensor for a compact camera. What does this mean? This means better low-light pictures (even without flash), like indoors, something that a lot of compact digicams have troubles with. Also, the Auto ISO is not as aggressive as the Fuji F200EXR. Unlike the Fuji, Canon doesn't do anything fancy with the S90 to get better low-light sensitivity. They just put in a bigger sensor, which is not a bad thing at all. Plus, don't be disappointed with the 10MP. Megapixel doesn't mean much anymore today. You noticed that smaller Canon and other digicams have 12MP and up. Don't be fooled. They have tiny sensor, which means really noisy and poor pictures at lowlight. Now, this doesn't mean the Canon S90 produces completely flawless images. This is not a DSLR after all. Using ISO 800 and above, the image is still very noisy, albeit better than most regular tiny digicams. With some aggressive noise reduction using software like Adobe Lightroom, you can still get usable images.3. Tons of manual controls. I'm not a photography buff, but I'm sure enthusiasts will love the range of things they can do with this camera.Cons:1. Not the most ergonomically designed controls. Many have complaints with the extremely-loose mini-ring control that doubles as a d-pad. By default, it controls exposure, and if you're not careful, you can accidentally set an incorrect exposure during shooting because a slight nudge will turn the ring. The pop-up flash can be annoying too, but I don't use the flash that often, and with practice, you can hold the camera without blocking the flash. The mode setting dial, on the other hand, is extremely stiff. I cannot change it using just my thumb. I have to actually use two fingers to dial it.2. Only records 640x480 video. In the age where almost every digicams can record HD video, this is a bit of disappointment. However, thanks to the large sensor, the ability of the sensor to capture more light in low-light situations transfers to the video recording capability too. I find videos recorded with the S90 to be brighter than other digicams. Still, if you're looking for a device that can be used as both a camera and HD camcorder, look elsewhere. The S90's main strength is taking pictures.3. Size. Sure, it's not a DSLR, but it's not that small either. This is not IXUS/SD-sized digicam. Not something you can easily put inside your jeans' pocket.4. The camera's auto white-balance is not the best. But hey, that's why you capture in RAW mode. :)In short, the Canon S90 is an excellent compact camera for picture-taking enthusiasts. Regardless of the cons, such as the lack of HD video recording, the picture quality and the capability to capture in RAW makes this camera worth every penny.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost precisely what I was looking for", "Author": "M. Hendry", "ReviewID": "R3JUL91UO2WMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a budding amateur photographer I have a dSLR and a few lenses, but even the body and one general purpose lens is too much to be lugging around in many situations, so a month or so back I started looking at super-compacts for those photo opportunities I was missing, something I could have on me at all times. My main criteria:* Truly portable. Jeans or shirt pocket.* Something that will survive there. Molded metal, not token pressed metal covers or plastic.* Extensive and easy to access manual adjustments.* Best image quality available for its class, especially low light - I hate using flash.* RAW capability.Canon haven't released a new S since 2005 I think (the venerable S80), but it is back with a vengeance and the S90 presses all the above buttons. It is also a much more attractive beast than the older ones IMO - all-black, sleek, very minimalist. The anodized aluminum casing looks to be close to 1mm thick all round and should stand up to quite a lot of abuse. The lens and control ring are plastic but suitably thick and sturdy. I am stunned by its image quality particularly in low light; it doesn't come close to cameras with larger sensors and lenses but it is impressive for a camera this size. The lens-mounted control ring is great. The camera has all the manual adjustments you could reasonably want using that ring, the rear wheel and the shortcut button, and it can be set to run almost invisibly, e.g. no flash, AF assist lamp or beeps, great for candid shots. The optical image stabilization is a major boon, and I can't overstate the importance of raw - the best shots often happen for me spontaneously in the worst conditions and even the best JPEG encoder will chew a quick noisy shot to pieces and limit recovery options.It does have a few downsides, mostly minor:* The control wheel on the back is too easy to jog. It's only caught me a couple of times (knocking it to ISO3200 in broad daylight, oops) and I've learned to work around it by changing my grip, but it could be addressed in firmware - wheel lock on the shortcut button please! For the next iteration I'd prefer another dial under the mode dial instead though.* The tiny lens has quite bad distortions and aberrations particularly at the wide end, but most of these can be dealt with in software. JPEGs are corrected well by the camera itself while RAWs are rightly left untouched. The included software will deal with RAWs but I use DxO/Lightroom, same flow as my SLR.* The anodized metal coating started to scratch off within a few days of life in my pocket. I kind of like this \"lived-in\" look though, makes it look old and even less conspicuous. :)* No HD video. This seems to be a must-have for some but wasn't an issue for me as I am primarily interested in stills. I don't think you can expect video worthy of HD out of something this small anyway - prosumer video cameras are way bigger and more expensive than this for a reason.* Zoom may not be long enough for some. Instead it's wide and fast which I prefer overall. I wouldn't mind if they dropped it back further to 2.5x or so to gain elsewhere. By the way, you won't get strong depth of field effects from a lens/sensor this size, despite what the promo literature may say. For closeups of small subjects it's noticeable, but you're not going to see much background blur on portraits, say. Like most fast lenses you also need to stop it down a bit to hit its sharpness \"sweet spot\", f/2 is rather soft at the edges.* The 3\" screen is beautiful but I think it might be too big if anything - it does battery life no favors and makes it more vulnerable to damage. Mine also has slight backlight bleed along the top edge but this isn't noticeable most of the time. Shrinking the screen a little would free up rear space for extra controls.* Battery life is an annoyance, bank on no more than 100 shots. I probably won't get a spare, it's just another thing to be carrying around which rather defeats the purpose, so I do need to remember to feed the thing frequently. Also, I don't know what the designers were thinking but the battery gauge gives virtually no warning when the camera's about to die - as soon as it drops from full to two bars you have very few shots left. I hope this is something Canon can fix in firmware because right now the gauge is close to useless.Many of these are compromises made to get class-leading image quality out of a camera so small - all in all very impressed and no way could I give it fewer than 5 stars. It's been ready to pop out of my pocket constantly since I bought it.Canon made the right choice here and with the G11 backing off from the \"megapixel race\". If anything they could go even lower - I got plenty of great shots out of my old Nikon D40 which was \"only\" 6MP. Sensor resolution was never a big issue there, and it's even less so on super-compacts with their tiny compromised optics. I'm interested to see how other manufacturers respond to Canon's raising the bar with this camera. Its excellent Sony CCD will surely show up elsewhere soon. Nikon in particular don't seem to have seriously tackled this area of the market yet - never been very impressed by their compacts - I hope this will wake them up.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great compact - full manual!!", "Author": "Stefano", "ReviewID": "R2SEHUSJRCIZS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great small camera, with full manual controls and smart dial around the lens.

Spent several months researching different cameras and reading hundreds of reviews before deciding to purchase the Canon S90 from Amazon on December 26th as an upgrade to my Canon Powershot 570.  It took about 2 weeks to arrive, but mail is slow during the holidays and this is Alaska.While I've been very happy with my 570, it doesn't produce high resolution enlargements that my full size Canon Rebel is capable of.  I was primarily wishing for a pocket camera with better resolution, and so far the S90 has delivered remarkably well.An important feature that attracted me to the S90, is the fast f2.0 lens - very useful for low light and night time photos.  I like to shoot sunset and aurora photos, so this was a major item for me.My chief complaint about the S90 are the small flat control buttons which are difficult to feel and locate in the dark.  The on/off button is especially annoying.  This button feels like its almost recessed a bit and it's much too small and extremely difficult to feel and locate in the dark.  I've pretty much overcome this problem by becoming more familiar with the camera, but the buttons are still aggravating at times.Suggestion to Canon: redesign the buttons so they're elevated a bit, which makes them easier to feel and locate in the dark.  Most other Canon cameras I've looked at have elevated buttons which are a much better design and vastly more user friendly.My other complaint about the S90 is that when you shoot a 15 second night time exposure, it takes at least 15 seconds, perhaps even more, to process the image before you can view it on the display.  My full size Rebel processes similar images in 2 or 3 seconds.Overall, I really like the S90.  It has a nice solid feel to it, and many extra features not found on other cameras.  I haven't used the RAW format feature yet, and some of the other features I'll probably never use, but they're nice to have just in case.While this camera will never compare with my Rebel and wide-angle lens for aurora shots, it's really nice to have a quality camera you can just put in your pocket and carry with you anywhere.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Compact Camera", "Author": "Bryan Crabtree", "ReviewID": "R3P5HSSHZUTKOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Purchased the S90 as a replacement for my Canon IXY 800IS, I wanted a small compact pocket camera with the same customability of my 5D.

I've since put the S90 to the test on a 10 day trip to Costa Rica and have been very happy with the results. Excellent image quality with full SLR customization, what more could you ask for.My only complaint is that the scroll wheel on the back does not click like every other digital camera Canon makes, I found it quite annoying on a few occasions when my thumb would accidentally graze the scroll wheel resulting in an exposure, shutter speed or ISO change + or - a step... I also found that I had to disable the \"special settings\" button because of it's placement, kept tapping it with my thumb and opening whatever settings were available for the Camera Mode I was in.For those that complain that the S90 doesn't have a metal body, I'm not too concerned with it, the camera feels very solid...

Fritz \"Nikon Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "RODSX5P48XQ4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first impressions of the Canon S90 Compact Camera are quite good although I do have a few nits:Some functions should be easier to set. For example, Canon requires you to go into the menus to format the SD card. I would prefer to do that with buttons like I can on a DSLR. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't set more functions in the custom menu (only five custom items can be set at one time.) It's really easy to smudge the LCD because it takes up almost the entire camera back. And the manual setting of aperture is backwards. Canon set the lens dial to turn like you are looking at the camera, but it needs to be reversed because you are setting it from the back of the camera. It's counter intuitive--and there's no way to change the dial rotation to match what comes naturally.Post processing tests show that the S90 takes RAW shots that easy to manipulate. The biggest drawback are with marginal photos (extremely underexposed, for example.) I can bring back mistakes in poorly executed shots taken with my DSLR. With the S90, however, the photos blow out and become surrealistic looking when I try to recover them. But in fairness, we are talking about shots that should really be greeted by the delete key.I shot some low light photos at ISO 2000 and 3200. These are ridiculously high settings to demand of a digital camera. I was impressed! This camera handles noise extremely well. Sure, noise is there at high ISO settings. If you look closely enough you will see it, but it's not objectionable.The image quality and detail are quite good. Focusing, even in low light, is fast and on the mark. There is almost no delay from the time I press the shutter button to the time the camera takes the photo. The camera does well in write speed to the SD card as well. Plus, I love being able to manually set aperture and shutter speed without using menus. That's a terrific feature! And I haven't missed an optical viewfinder.The Canon PowerShot S90 is a well designed, solid camera. The build quality is excellent. It's small, but easy to handle.

However, it does have a few deficiencies.(Note: use Google to locate the items mentioned in the \"fixes\" below.)1. The most serious deficiency is a very loose rear control dial that can accidentally be rotated without noticing it. Use Google to search for \"S90 loose dial\" to find a simple do-it-yourself solution. Lensmate markets a different type of simple fix.2. The camera is small and has a slick finish. Richard Franiec markets a small custom grip that attaches to the camera to make it easier to hold.3. The included wrist strap has no way to \"lock\" it to your wrist. Gordy's Camera Straps markets a \"custom\" wrist strap that does have a simple \"locking\" mechanism. If you prefer a neck lanyard, Photosolve markets a nice one as does Gordy's Camera Straps.4. The Users Manual can be reasonably daunting for the novice user. It is complete and has a decent Table of Contents, but the Index is terrible.

Last month, I was shopping for a P&S; that would fill the niche between my iPhone and dSLR.  I had read great reviews of the S90 and the G11, and so I tried both out at our local camera shop.  For me, the S90 was easily superior to the G11.S90 vs G11:1.  The image sensor is the same, so theoretically the image quality should be the same.2. The S90 is fully manual, including selecting aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  The external controls are customizable, with one control ring on the back and one on the front, so that I don't have dig into menus.3. I don't find the lack of an optical viewfinder a problem - I just adapt by using only the screen, which is very bright and easily visible even in sunshine.4. The S90 is very compact (much smaller than the G11) and feels sturdy as a brick (as opposed to the G11, which feels flimsier and plasticky).5. The S90 is $50 cheaper.Performance so far:1. I have been very impressed with high ISO performance: 400 is fine, 800 is usable and even 1600 can be used in a pinch.2. JPEG's out of the camera come out quite nicely, if that's your preference.  However, I shoot RAW, so this is irrelevant to me.3. Shooting at f/2 is really nice - getting thin DOF and some bokeh on a P&S; is a pleasant surprise (though see con #4 below).4. Workflow: I shoot RAW with Adobe (Camera Raw & Photoshop) post-processing, and the results are OK.  Canon's own post-processing software (bundled for free with the camera) does a better job with noise reduction (making 800 and 1600 usable) and with correcting barrel distortion (see below).Cons:1. The rear control ring is loose; when in Aperture priority mode, this ring controls exposure compensation - so it's easy to change the exposure by accident.2. The flash pops up using a cool servo motor mechanism, but it's in a strange place: right where your left forefinger ought to be.3. Terrible barrel distortion - again, Canon's software fixes this, but if you use ACR & PS, you have to fix it yourself.4. This is a variable aperture lens: it's f/2 only on the wide end, and the minimum aperture shrinks considerably (4.9) at the telephoto end.5. Alas, it's only a P&S.;  It's great for getting a shot when you don't have your gear or when it's inconvenient to have it (e.g., when I shot in 4-degree weather on ice), but it's IQ is nowhwere near an SLR's.6. Video is SD, not HD.  This doesn't matter to me.  You can't change settings while shooting video - that's a bummer.Bottom line:I very highly recommend it as a photographer's always-with-me-camera.  Its only competition in the same price range is the Panasonic Lumix LX3, which is over a year old now.  You could get a micro-4/3 camera (e.g., Panasonic GF1 or Olympus PEN), but it will cost twice as much.

Lara", "ReviewID": "R1PLCA63QP9R5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this camera is awesome. Everyone's \"pros\" are all true. I won't cover all that since everyone else has.  I've owned this camera for a week and have taken about 300 shots.  I've owned many canon cameras (S45, SD400, SD600, S80, G10, XT, XTi, 50D).  I've taken it to a couple restaurants and to the LA Zoo.  The way I see it, if I'm paying top dollar, I want top quality.  $430.00 is pretty steep.  You can get great cameras for around $200-$250. For twice the price, I expect this camera to be a darn great camera.  This is why I'm nit picking.  Here's why I gave it 4 stars:BUILD QUALITYIt's just ok.  It's not that great.  I'm pretty sure a 4 foot drop means bye bye to your $430.00 investment.  It's mostly made out of plastic if not all plastic.  I've owned the G10 and the S80... talk about solid.  Canon made these cameras with a metal body, why not for the S90.  I'm sure the additional weight would have been negligible. A leather grip in the front would have been great too.  It would work well with the weird thumb slot in the back.The plastic behind the flash also makes a clicking sound when you press on it.  This has been a known issue.  Some have it, some don't.  Mine does.  I may exchange it but not sure.  Minor issue, but annoying.IMAGE QUALITYFor night shots and low light, it's awesome.  I shot in bright day light at the LA zoo on Auto and I felt like the images were overexposed.  I switched to \"P\" and underexposed the settings and the pictures came out better. The sensor may be too sensitive even at \"Auto\".  Hopefully this issue is resolved in the next firmware upgrade.Like most say, it's great in low light situations but I've found SOME shots to be noisy and grainy, even in well lit night situations when the camera is set on a tripod.  It was sharp, but noise was visible.  I would not enlarge those prints.FLASHThe flash pops up automatically and it's a bit freaky at first.  You just have to get used to it.  Canon should have just made it stationary like they usually do.  I don't see any reason why they needed it to pop up and down like that.  It's cool at first but it gets old fast.  My concern isn't me, it's more when you give it to the waiter / waitress at a restaurant and the flash pops up and startles him / her and drops your pricey S90.  Yikes.  Make sure you hand strangers the handstrap when they take pictures for you, just in case.I also wished it came with a hot shoe.  Sure it's top heavy and looks funny but the Panasonic LX3 has it.  Couldn't hurt.  One of my biggest complaits with P&S; camera's is the harsh effects of direct flashes.  They need to design a flash that can point up and bounce the flash to the ceiling for a softer pictures.  Doesn't take a genius to design something like that.Over all it's still a great camera.  These issues can be overlooked but this isn't perfect.  I think it's still the best point and shoot out there.

This camera's features have already been described and rated more than adequately.  However, I do want to address a few of the problems that others have described, which are either the result of misuse or could easily be remedied.1.  The camera is too slippery:  Lensmate sells an adhesive finger grip for $32 that is so well designed, it looks like part of the camera.  It allows it to be held one-handed, and places your fingers in the right place.  Granted, Canon should have designed the camera with something similar already molded in place, but this is a simple fix that enhances handling immensely.2.  The shutter button is in the wrong place:  This means you're holding the camera incorrectly.  With your middle finger on the Lensmate grip and your thumb against the little notch in back on the upper right, your index finger will fall right onto the shutter button.  Maybe Canon should have included a section in the manual on how to hold the camera.3.  The flash is in the wrong place, and can be damaged by your left index finger:  You should not be holding the camera that way.  The control ring around the lens is a great feature; your left hand should be holding the camera there, not on the body like it's a gigantic credit card.4.  It's too easy to accidentally turn the exposure control ring in back and mess up a shot:  For $5, Lensmate sells a plastic ring that sticks on around the control ring and prevents this from happening; if anything, it makes it a little difficult to turn the control ring at all - you have to use a fingernail or the entire surface of your thumb to move it with the stick-on ring in place.  Also, with your other fingers where they are supposed to go, nothing should be near the control ring anyway.The really great thing about this camera is that with the two control rings, you have more options to make changes fast enough to get shots you might have otherwise missed.  This is the difference between a point and shoot and a dslr - the dslr has knobs and buttons to change white balance, ISO, aperture, and shutter speed, while a point and shoot requires you to root through menus to make the same changes, assuming they're available at all.  The control rings on the s90 provide some of the manual control of a dslr without the size.  It's said that the best camera in the world is useless if you don't have it with you.  It's a major commitment to lug around a dslr and possibly two or three lenses - you have to be in the frame of mind to say \"I'm a photographer and I'm going out today to take pictures.\"  Meanwhile, the s90's tiny size allows it to fit into a shirt pocket.  It's also less obtrusive for street photography - in environments where a dslr with a cannon-sized lens would draw too much attention or intimidate some subjects, the s90 looks like a crappy point and shoot, one step above a cell phone camera.Now that the s90 has been around for a few years, other manufacturers have copied the dual control-ring idea, and Canon has already come out with several newer versions.  These are only incrementally better than the s90.  If you don't have one, the next-to-the-last is probably fine; if you already have a s90, there's no need to upgrade to its successors.Obviously, the s90 won't have the versatility of a full dslr setup; it's not going to work as well for low light or sports photography, and of course it's limited to the built-in lens.  But for a go-anywhere camera with more controls than other units of the same size, it's a great choice.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best P&S; camera I've ever used...period", "Author": "DR", "ReviewID": "RKYFOQP8MU8Q0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently got this camera (yes i know, the S95 just came out) and I've loved using it.The S90 is a point and shoot camera,but not necessarily compact.

The control ring can easily get confused for the shutter button when you're not paying attention. It only has a 3.8X zoom, but the large f/2 aperture is worth it.

Zoomed in at 100% there is little chromatic abberation and only some purple fringing, but it wont detract from the photo too much. It has less chromatic abberation than average (most P&S; cameras ive seen have it to some extent so don't get too uptight about it). The RAW capabilities are pretty nice, but there is a great amount of barrel distortion when shot in RAW mode. The camera does a really good job of correcting it when converted to JPEG though.This is the low light king of the P&S; jungle. Sony and Casio have CMOS sensors with a mode to take several pictures at different exposures at a high speed. Not needed with the s90. The day I got it I tried using it in a dark parking lot at night in front of a few shops. I was able to see everything in the picture with the f/2 lens at iso 80 and 1/5 shutter speed. It takes some time to play with the settings and figure out what works.Blur from hand shake isnt that bad due to the IS on this camera.It takes some time to get used to the plethora of controls and settings. This camera isn't for novice users. If you're looking for a great point and shoot and aren't technically inclined, then search for another camera. As i said before, this camera does a decent job in auto mode, but it really shines in manual. The auto mode sometimes selects settings that may undersaturate the pictures.Colors are for the most part accurate, but greens tend to be somewhat bright and reds and blues are very strong. Yellows tend to shift toward to green but its not that bad.The camera operates at an average speed, with some shutter lag and as long as you prefocus, it shouldn't be that bad.Overall, this is a great point and shoot with great low light abilities. It produces better pictures than any other point and shoot I've seen and its large sensor only adds to the experience. With decent noise handling up to iso 800, which i havent seen on any other point and shoot, it will give you a sharp image in any light.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent everyday/everywhere camera!", "Author": "Meghan", "ReviewID": "RM7T9LYXY9I5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many years as a loyal Sony customer, I decided to give Canon a go and purchased this camera. Now, all I have to say is...... I *LOVE* this camera! It's the perfect size to toss in your bag and carry with you all day, every day. The automatic modes are great, and they result in excellent photos on the whole. I have a more sophisticated camera as well, and I find that photos I take in the automatic mode are almost always burry or dark; the canon (on the other hand) quickly switches between automatic modes and sets up a great photo in a just few seconds, which makes it perfect for quick snapshots or photos on the go. The controls are intuitive and I love that you have many options for manual controls should you decide you want to experiment or get creative! I also love the dial on the front of the camera; it makes it a lot easier to access functions that would normally be hidden a few button presses down on other point and shoot cameras. Also, I find that I rarely need to use the flash because of the lens in this camera. As a result, my photos have really natural looking colors, and my subject's eyes are less often closed or squinted. :-)If you are looking for a camera that takes excellent pictures on the go and is a camera that you can take with you everywhere, I would highly suggest you consider this one!

Its external controls make it extremely easy to use manual settings-something I never even really bother with on other point and shoots I have owned because it always involves tons of sub-menus and button-pushing.

I found the menu system fairly easy to use.I read all these horror stories about accidentally adjusting the dial on the back and how impossible it is to hold on to this camera. I really haven't had a problem, I'm not sure if I have just always handled cameras the way this one falls to hand but it has not been a problem. It could have a bigger grip, but I definitely haven't had a problem without it. I would say go to a camera store and see how it fits in your hand if you can.Really, though all of these things could be said about other point and shoots, what sets this camera apart is the quality of images you can extract with such a compact camera, and how easy it is to do so. The biggest thing I noticed was the killer for point-and-shoots-slightly-less-than-light indoor situations. You don't want to use a flash and wash someone out. Previously all you could do was raise the ISO and watch your photo turn to grain or come out a blurry mess. This camera takes astoundingly good pictures in that situation-which is, let's face it, the situation that 80% of casual snapshots are taken. Rarely do you get to take a picture of grandma out on a day in the park with a setting sun. Usually it's in some half-lit room somewhere. My DSLR also can do this, but I have to take it around everywhere, and people don't act naturally when you point a big ol serious camera at them. I have gotten some really lovely images, both with the AUTO mode and using the program/manual functions.

Truly anyone who doesn't like what this camera has to offer was either expecting it to be equal to a DSLR (which it never claims to be) or those who find it far too complicated because they really only needed an SD1200.Pros:  \"Ditto\" to the other 200+ reviews.Cons:  While not enough to bring down my 5 star rating, I do have a few issues with both the camera and with Canon.1.  Of the 200+ reviews so far, only about 4 of them have actually said anything about the macro capabilities of this camera.  And of those, only one has actually pointed out just how lame the macro capabilities of the S90 really are.  By comparison, my old SD800 will zoom in and focus on an area 1/8th the size of what the S90 can focus on.  And the SD800 was just a basic point and shoot, not the high end camera that this one is.  I have included a photo in the customer images section to show how significant the size difference is.  The other problem is that the macro focus distance on the S90 is approximately 18\" in front of the camera not the 2\" of previous cameras.  Even the most steady handed of photographers will likely require a tripod to achieve a blur free image.2.  The DPP software included with the camera, while certainly not Lightroom 3, is actually a really good software program because it is designed to work specifically with this camera.  And yet Canon doesn't provide any information whatsoever about it.  There was more than enough room left on the software disk to have included the manual several times over.  And did they even point out the wealth of information including video tutorials that can be found in the EOS section of the Canon website?  Nope.  It is this information that truly shows what an amazing camera the S90 really is.3.  Ergonomics are awkward at best.  I have no issues with the missing \"grip\" that many people complain about as I hold the camera like the point and shoot camera that it is not like an SLR.  (i.e. first and third fingers on the top, thumb on the bottom, middle finger on the shutter button.)  The real problem is the ring function.  This is a legacy feature from the days of viewfinders and in case Canon didn't notice, they left that part out.  And as the camera is not held adjacent to the face as would be the case with viewfinder cameras, reaching around to the front of the camera to adjust the ring when it is 18\" in front of your face is extremely awkward.4.  And finally as a minor point, scrolling through the SCR modes has to be done blindly.  Canon should have put scrolling icons on the display like it did for every other multiple-selection feature on the camera.Conclusion:Once you get over the initial feeling that holding this camera is like holding a stick of butter, you will find that this is truly a great camera.  And with the support and tutorial information available on the EOS side of the Canon site, anyone from a beginner to a moderately advanced amateur will find they can grow both with it and into it.As for the lame macro capabilities, I will just have to keep an old SD800 around to do that work.  I do have a feeling however that I will begin to appreciate the 18\" distance to the subject part far more when I get the camera underwater as it is difficult to get fish to come in to the 2\" range.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love love love this camera!

Since the Casio was showing its age, I was looking for a very compact camera to carry in a belt-pouch as a replacement.My review might be a little premature since I've only owned the camera a few weeks but so far, WOW!  The rear control ring, which adjusts EV value by default, is easy to knock if you're not careful but since relative EV value shows on the LCD, it's just as easy to get into the habit of checking the EV setting as you would shutter speed or F-stop (and it shows right down in the same area of the LCD that those settings do).  And if you're a skilled photographer making the most of your camera, you will often want to check and tweak the EV value to optimize your shots, anyway.The camera LCD is breathtaking (not quite as good as a Nikon D300's but great for appreciating your pictures as you take them).  The pictures are very sharp.  The low-light capability of the camera is impressive and I like the motion-warning that's very obvious when you're about to cross the threshold of acceptable shutter speeds in a low-light situation.

Too bad it doesn't offer local area correction like Nikon Capture NX2 does but I guess one can always plunk down the money for Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3, which offers local corrections and handles Canon S90 RAW images.I tried two belt cases for the S90 based on online reviews.  Both the Canon Powershot 500 case and the LowePro Rezo 30 case fit the S90 well.  The Rezo 30 case closes with a zipper, not as convenient as the Velcro flap on the Canon case but better for keeping the dust and dirt out of the case.  Canon case has a permanent belt loop while the Rezo case easily detaches from the belt, using a combination of a Velcro flap and button snap to securely attach the case to a belt.All in all, I highly recommend the Canon S90 for a camera you can easily carry anywhere on your belt but takes GREAT pictures and is a joy to use.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Tips, tricks, and opinions from an experienced photographer", "Author": "Roldan Pozo", "ReviewID": "RU88VXN4J4Z4E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of the best compact cameras out there, and I won't repeat the major points of previous reviews but will add my own thoughts and suggestions using this camera on various travel shoots.  Overall, I was pleased with the image results on a recent trip to Tuscany.  Being able to handle low-light well, and provide an f/2 at a wide-angle (28mm equivalent) setting cannot be understated, as many group photos occur under these conditions.  For landscape, panoramic photos it worked well (almost as good as early DSLRs).A few things to keep in mind:*) The camera takes a *long* time to focus and process an image.  Forget this camera for sports, active kids, etc.*) There is a noticeable chromatic aberration (CA) although this can be corrected somewhat with Photoshop plugings and RAW converters.*) At wide-angle settings, the lens has significant barrel distortion.  This is somewhat corrected in JPG, but not in RAW, although there are various ways of dealing with this in post.*) The AUTO white balance tended to render outdoor scenes with a blue-ish cast.  Can be compensated by adjusting the default temperature towards the RED range.*) The ISO can be *easily* changed from the round flywheel in the back, and often the camera would go from AUTO-ISO into 3200.

The firmware should be smart enough to know that quick turns should change the setting in full stops while slow turns change it in 1/3 stops. - The front control dial lags between photos.  I take a shot, adjust the front control wheel immediately afterwards, and there is no effect.  I have to wait for the camera to get into \"ready\"-mode before turning the wheel has an effect. - Continuous shooting speed is a bit low, about a frame per second.  I'm a bit perplexed why low-quality JPEGs have the same continuous shooting speed as RAWs.Nitpicking - The button at the top for choosing what function to assign to the control wheel is a bit of a waste.  Once you've set it to your liking, there's really no need to ever press it again.  It's in a good spot - I wish it could be reassigned to something else. - The wrist strap doesn't have a wrist lock. - On wide, the lens distorts anything not in the center of the frame.

I don't always want to lug around a huge DSLR and lenses yet I don't want to completely give up low-light capability.  This has been the Point and Shoot pitfall for too long.  The S90 changes the rules, allowing you to get very clean shots at ISO 400, decent at ISO 800 and usable at ISO 1600 and 3200.  I would print an ISO 800 shot at 8x10 straight out of the camera, to give you some idea of the noise and resolution profile at that setting.Build quality is a mixed bag.  While the front and back are metal and solid, the whole camera has a rather dainty feel to it.  You have to manipulate he real control dial rather gingerly and the buttons can be hard to find by feel at times.  Some of these cameras have a flexy top panel (press where it says \"PowerShot\") but my example thankfully is solid here.  The front control ring has a little play in it.  For the price, this camera should be G-series tough, but it misses the mark by a little.To really appreciate this camera you have to make use of its unique features.  The f/2 lens paired with Canon's excellent IS and a low-noise sensor allows you to do things you simply can't with most other compacts.  Full manual control is at your fingertips and the menus feature high-end features like auto exposure bracketing and flash compensation.  Still, I can't place the S90 on too high a pedestal.  My 30D still rules in terms of image quality by a noticeable margin.  The S90 is for those occasions when I want to travel lightly, and perhaps more importantly, discreetly.

I also own a Pentax K-X dSLR and the S90 gives better no-nonsense, low light pictures.  I could probably tweak adjustments on my K-X to get a slightly better shot indoor shots.  But these are usually spur of the moment and you don't have time for adjustments.The size of the S90 is really nice too.  The K-X is my hobby camera but the S90 is the one I take around with me 95% of the time.  There's a nice camera case made by Olympus that fits this camera perfectly.  It's black neoprene with a magnetic flap, and can be bought at local electronics store for a few Lincolns.LCD on this thing is awesome.  It's big, bright and high-res.  It has incredible viewing angle.  This is really nice when you are showing pictures to a group and everyone can see.  LCD on my K-X is trash compared to S90.It's not a perfect camera for everyone but for me its 5 stars.  I can easily see how someone could rate this 3 stars.  Yes, it requires more coordination than the average p-s camera.  The button placement takes some getting used to.  I still spin the back control wheel on accident every now and then.

Out of all of the pocket cameras, the S90 is the best on the market (I might be overstepping my bounds there, but I haven't seen anything this size that compares). The trick is figuring out what you're looking for, if you're looking to take the best pictures possible, stop reading this and go get yourself a DSLR, at some point maybe pocket cameras will replace them, but we aren't there yet. If you're looking to take the best pictures possible without having to drag a DSLR everywhere, then you might have just found what you are looking for. Why not something like the G10 or G11? Personally I feel they're too big, if you have to drag something like that around why not get a DSLR?Cons:- Battery life: I read about this before I got the camera, so I got an extra battery, I'm not bothered, but that's mostly because I knew what I was getting myself into.- limited depth of field manipulation: I was really hoping with the 2.0 aperture it would give a better blur effect, the effect is there, but it really isn't as pronounced as I hoped it would be.- easy to accidentally move the wheel on the back: this isn't a big deal to me, but I do find that I often move the back wheel when using the buttons on the back. Luckily when shooting this is tied to the exposure comp in most modes (so it doesn't drastically change my shot), the biggest annoyance is when I am viewing pictures and I accidentally move to the next image when zoomed in.Other people's cons:- speed: I read someplace that the processing of image series is slow, I haven't tested it because if I am shooting serious action I will have a DSLR (however if you don't this might be a concern).- build quality: I am not bothered by the build quality, and I tend to abuse the hell out of things, but I also tend not to care if things get banged up. If this is a major concern for you, maybe you should check out the G10/G11.- Non-HD Video: Personally I think people are making a bigger deal out of this than they should, if you are looking for high quality video you should be looking at video cameras, cameras just don't have the same quality. I view video on a camera as a bonus, so I am perfectly happy with the video quality on the S90, particularly if it keeps the camera small. Of course I wound't mind HD if they could fit it into the same size body.Pros:- Image quality for the body size: As I said above I don't think there is anything this small that compares.- Control wheels! Love these things, so much control at your fingertips! Further more you can program the button on the back (I set mine to white balance), which makes shooting fast.- portabilityBuying a camera is all about figuring out what your needs are, if you are looking for ultra portable quality above all else, you just found your new camera! If you are looking at quality above all else check out a DSLR. If you're looking for something in the middle, or you aren't cool with the cons listed, you might want to read other people's reviews comparing some of the other larger cameras to the S90. I gave it 5 stars, even though I thought about giving it 4, because it's exactly what I wanted (aside from the depth of field issue), a camera I can take with me all the time so I have it when I'm not going out \"shooting\", a camera that takes great pictures and fits in my pocket.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Canon Camera", "Author": "Mark D. Manglicmot", "ReviewID": "RF2OVCT506HL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon S90 is a good companion for my Canon 40D.  Is it perfect?  No, that's why it's 4 stars.  Now saying that, as of January 2010, there is no other camera that compares to this one.---Image QualityThe IQ of the S90 is outstanding at 80 ISO and good at higher ISO levels.  After comparing this to my 40D pics, there is a noticeable sharpness difference, especially at higher ISO levels.  Still, comparing it to my friends' point and shoots, it's ahead of its competition.  Currently, I haven't really messed with the RAW features, like I do with my 40D because I use Adobe Lightroom 2 as my photo edit/management software.  Maybe the IQ is better there.---FeaturesOne of the main reasons for my purchase of the S90 is the manual features.  With these features, I have good control of the creative aspects of my photos.  Av, Tv, P, M, Low-Light, Scene and Video are the dial features and there are more within the menus.  Since I do have a 40D, that means I don't have video features, so I'm glad that this camera fills that void.  You'll love the front ring and it's versatility =)---Size/ConstructionThe good thing is that the S90 is smaller than the G11, but it isn't the smallest point-and-shoot.  The S90 will fit in a jean pocket... but will be very uncomfortable in tight jeans.  A carry case would be nice or just throw it in a backpack.  At first, I did have my reservations of the plastic body, but I've put it through hell and back on my expedition in the Philippines (later in the review) and I'm confident in its durability.---PerformancePerformance is a crucial piece for any camera to ensure you capture the moment.  The S90 lags a little.  Definitely, it's better than most point-and-shoots, but I was hoping for it to be faster.  The start-up time is manageable, but the auto-focus time is a little slow.  Also, yes, the f/2.0 is very welcome, but I'm finding it hard to create the shallow DoF (depth of field) in some portrait shots I'd take.  I'm assuming it's because that f-stop is only accessible at wide-angles.  Of course, the rapid shots aren't anything comparable to my 40D, but I don't use this camera for that (thank god).---Low Light PicturesLow light pictures are a main draw for this camera.  It's hard to capture these photos on point-and-shoots because of their ISO performance and aperture values.  This camera excels in both categories having great ISO performance and a great aperture value at 28mm.  This is a make or break for most people and I'm glad to say you'll appreciate these features.---Battery LifeDefinitely a downside of the S90.  It's about 200-300 photos worth per charge.  Still, I don't take more than that per day with this camera, but I know people will or maybe one day I'll find myself in that situation.  This is mostly because of the full-time LCD (which is a gorgeous 3.0\" screen)  So if you plan on shooting more than 300+ photos, buy and bring an extra battery.---OverallYes, I am pleased with this camera.  It's not the perfect camera, but it is very close to it.  There are things that they could improve, such as 720p HD video recording, better battery life, maybe a constant f/2.0 value (haha) and a metal construction (just because it'd just be better overall).---Philippines ExperienceSo recently in December, I took my camera to the Philippines.

So when I saw that they took the guts of a G11 and put them into an actual compact, I knew I had to have it.The S90 is by far the best point-and-shoot I've used. It outperforms the G10 in picture quality (both overall, and looking and 100% zooms of the pixels), is light and compact, and has full manual control (and a very clever control ring that makes manual adjustment very easy). You will not find a better camera per cubic inch. Yet, I did find that I had to get over my \"cameras must look big and professional\" insecurity.

Somehow, dust particles had migrated through the lens barrel and onto the sensor.  For a compact camera like this, sending the camera back to Canon to have the sensor cleaned costs in the neighborhood of $150.  For that money, you might as well buy a new camera.  So I very carefully opened up the camera myself, located the sensor and used compressed air to clean the sensor myself.  Problem temporarily solved.The camera worked fine until a few months later when the black dots started appearing in my pictures again.  This time I was not so lucky in my several attempts to clean the sensor and ended up having to junk the camera.This is apparently a common problem with the S90, which is unfortunate given how expensive it is for a compact.

If I was going to carry around a G11, I might as well take my dSLR with one of my smaller lenses.  In comes the Canon S90.This camera is the best pocket point and shoot I've ever had my hands on.  It out-performs all others with high quality images.  The best part is that it offers most of the manual controls of a dSLR.  So, for those who like to shoot in manual, this little camera will allow you to take over aperture, shutter, iso and focus.  AND it has dedicated dials to do so.

In low light, the images are very good up to ISO 800 after which the quality degrades significantly. The D300 is superb up to ISO 1600 after which it also degrades.The two control wheel mechanisms on the S90 make it easy to adjust white balance or any other setting on the fly. Very convenient!I love the SLR like ability to select manual or aperture mode with ease and take shots without bothering with all the myriad scene settings. Having said that, the camera is simple enough to hand it over to a stranger to take photos of you with intimidating them. Something that cannot be said of a DSLR. :-)One aspect I didnt like was the panorama mode - it doesn't generate a panoramic image out of the box - you have to download the images and let the software stitch it together for you. This seems old-tech to me when my friends Samsung smartphone did it directly on the phone.The zoom range is adequate for 90% of normal shooting by anyone. I would have liked another 3mm extra in the wide angle side though.Its light weight and compact size makes it easy to carry around in a shirt pocket. This is why it makes the most sense for a SLR owner - use it for situations where carrying a bulky and heavy SLR would be a burden or overkill.Overall - this is a great camera for a DSLR owner as a perfect companion to it.

The picture quality is great in general, however it is not a camera to be used in Automatic mode only. If you do that, you will end up with plenty of dark pictures because the flash does not shoot all the time. Sometimes the camera thinks it is bright enough without flash.A friend of mine showed me some tricks on how to use the manual settings (and I am no expert by any means!!) and now I get good - great pictures most of the time. Outdoors is not a problem at all, but indoors and/or at nights, that's the tricky part. But I guess you have that problem with most cameras. All in all, it is a great low-light camera though.One thing I love about it, you can manually adjust the strength of the flash so if your pictures come out too dark, you can just increase the flash and that might help - great feature.The one downside I had to experience the hard way is, the camera is slippery and there is a great chance for it to get dropped. This also happened to me and it landed right on the lense. So when I tried to turn off the camera, the lense wouldn't retract anymore, it was stuck. But I did some research on the net and found the solution, just push it back into position. I did that and it worked fine. I just had to manually bend the front cover of the lens back in place and now it works like a charm again (I called Canon, but they do not replace the 5-cent plastic cover of the lense, you have to buy the entire lense for aroun US$180).

Beyond the built-in functions, this camera is also capable of handling other creative functions for advanced photography, such as bracketing for HDR (examples also included in photos samples).I'll spare you all the technical stuff, because you can read all of that anywhere. It's easy enough for anyone to use, function-packed enough for a pro to use, and it is well worth every penny you pay for it.Also, because underwater casing/housing can cost thousands for larger DSLR cameras, I got the underwater casing/housing for my Canon S90.  It's perfect.  The picture quality is great underwater, and it's not bulky and awkward like a larger camera's housing would be.If you have any questions or want to see any specific examples, just ask in a comment!

Reliability is good, and picture quality in ideal conditions of light (i.e., daylight) turn out only a bit less than my Nikon D40 DSLR.If I had known beforehand, I'd probably not have bought this camera due to  the little wheel adjustment (default operation is ISO) on the back that spins too freely. Putting the camera in you pocket can move the wheel far out of adjustment and you might take several unusable shots before you discover your mistake. Lots of complaints can be found on the internet about this particular problem.The other thing I don't like about this camera is that there is no viewfinder.  I knew this going in, and thought it would no problems. However, for me it is. In bright sunlight, you can hardly see where you are focused.  You might have to take a number of pictures to get focus and exposure correct, and that's assuming you can get it correct since the LCD is washed out by the light.In retrospect, if you want an adjustable camera with a larger CCD, and much smaller than a DSLR, I'd probably go with the slightly bulkier Canon G12 or  comparable from another brand.

I called the manufacturer, Canon, and we did a \"reset power\" by holding the power button on for 20 seconds, and then releasing it.  Then I suppose it was suppose to power back on, but it would not. Canon told me to send it in. I asked if this is a known problem and the agent said no.

I can firmly state that this camera has no trauma to it!

I rated construction quality as 3 stars and handling as 3 stars because some of the controls aren't as optimal as they could be.  For instance, your shutter finger always wants to push the top rotary dial on the camera instead of the shutter.  And the control dial on the back is a bit on the flimsy side.

I appreciate the ability to look at a scene, compose a photo, and manipulate the camera settings in order to capture the photo as I want.  My Nikon DSLR doesn't even have an \"Auto\" setting.But there's one problem with the DSLR...portability.  There are some events where it just doesn't make sense to bring along the bigger camera.  It doesn't fit too well into my suit pocket!  In the past, I've missed some shots at these events because I didn't have my camera, and I'm not a fan of the low quality pictures that you get from most compact digital cameras.  After some searching, I was happy to find a compact camera with enough user-defined input for my needs.I'll start by saying that this camera doesn't produce images that rival that of a good DSLR.  But it does produce very good images.  Just stay away from the \"Auto\" mode.  I find that the Aperture Priority mode on this camera can produce some very good results, when coupled with the very easily-accessible exposure compensation settings.  The front ring allows for very quick aperture adjustments, and simple manipulation in this mode can produce photos that are far superior to those taken with most compact cameras.  Again, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the controls, and have a basic understanding of camera operation...but you'll be happy with the results.Also, I wouldn't get too hung up on MegaPixels.  Huge MP numbers are marketing BS, IMHO.  Most of us will never crop or print a photo to such a degree that we will need much more than 8-10 MP resolution.  And I'd go so far as to say that anything greater than 10MP in a compact camera will only serve to expose the flaws in the low-quality lenses that these cameras use.  I'd also say that most compact camera users shoot in something other than RAW mode, which in effect is reducing your image quality further.  Anyway, point is...don't get caught up in the MegaPixel hype.The one complaint that I have is of the built-in flash placement.  I don't use the flash much, but sometimes it is unfortunately necessary.  The problem is, the flash pops out of the top of the camera right where most of us would be holding the camera with our left hands.  A little annoying, but certainly something to which I can adjust.If you're like me and you'd like to have some creative control while shooting with a compact camera, then the S90 is a great choice.

Then, nearly all the time, I had to change the dial setting back to what it was when I put the camera away last.There was no way to disengage the dial. There was no way to configure it so its vagaries had no effect on picture quality. Indeed, there is no way to configure the control dial except in preset pairings with a matching configuration of the control ring. I wish it had offered the ability to program the two dials separately, including turning one or both of them off.This dial meant that I could not do with this camera what I had been able to do with a string of cheaper, lesser cameras, many of them Canons: whip out a little camera with one hand and capture a quick picture of something going on around me.In addition to the freewheeling control dial, the camera had a second, less fatal flaw, but a flaw nevertheless -- the smooth surface of the fingertip grip on the front made the camera hard to hold and easy to drop or slip around. If your fingers get slick from being cold and dry or hot and sweaty, watch out.Others have argued that anyone can adapt to such things, and if there were no other options, I'd agree. And you can buy a good add-on grip. But for my purposes -- quick, unobtrusive photos -- the camera simply would not do, even though it had every other qualification and took good pictures with a nice bright lens.I have not seen an S95, but I understand that both features I mention here have been changed. The S95 lists a textured finish to improve the grip, and the control dial has been replaced with a click wheel.If you buy the S90, plan on pausing to check the dial setting before every picture.

Although the camera was \"dead\" for four days after I fell into a swollen creek, the camera dried out and soldiered on as expected of a Canon.Excellent low-light quality photographs.Long battery life.Cons:LCD is very hard to see through in even normal sunlight.New photographers will have to read the owner's manual to fully take advantage of the S90's many features.  This is obviously only a \"con\" for novices.No handgrip. The flat, flushed design makes holding this camera tricky.  I wrapped black electric tape around the right side for a better hold in the backcountry.Shutter release is a tad too far to the left of the hand grip; it doesn't feel ergonomically designed.Back knob moves too easily from the set mode.  A locking device would be ideal.I bought this camera along with a Gorillapod, a small tripod I love.  This made group and self-portraits a breeze.  I also added four Maximal batteries to my load.

I hope this isn't an early demise for such an otherwise great camera.  I've taken a few stars off for unreliability due to this.

Upon doing my research on different camera types, I bought this camera over the Panasonic LX3, Canon G11, and the Ricoh TL500/EX1.  However, now that Panasonic is releasing their LX5, I am wondering how that camera will measure up to my Canon S90.I am VERY impressed with the low level light, and other setting of this camera.  I love to take flash-less pictures because I want the color saturation of the environment, and this camera impressed the other photographer junkies at my wife's dance performance.  Upon blowing up the pictures on my monitor, they were very good, especially when my other camera would have failed at capturing the details.My other uses are to capture moments with my daughter and dog, also flash-less photography.  It excels in this as well.  I switch from the Color Accent mode, to the Nostalgic mode (for black & white pictures), and regular Auto mode.  I have experimented with the manual settings, but I need more time to develop a better understanding.  Thus far I am impressed the with responsiveness of the camera in the scenic pictures I have taken.I do not like the build quality of the camera.  I am referring to the plastic used to build this camera.  Coming from a Polymer Engineer, that is a big statement.  I would rather have this camera be built from metal, or have a fiberglass reinforces polyproplyene be used in its construction.  This way I know it will be rugged.Also, the flash can be annoying in that it pops up next to my left hand.  Also this camera usually requires two handed operation.  There is a hand hold add-on from a third party, but that is another $33 and is something I wish Canon would have added onto this camera.  The rear dial does spin easily, and can allow negligent switching between camera modes.  But this has not occurred frequently enough to be a high ranking annoyance.This camera is based off the Panasonic Lumix DMC LX3.  In some cases, it is better with a 3.8x zoom.  But now that the Panasonic Lumix DMC LX5 is out, I am questioning my purchase.  That new development aside, I chose this camera over those listed above because of the better reviews and better zoom feature over the Panasonic LX3.

The camera packs some great high end features, like full manual control and RAW capability.  It also offers manual focus, a pretty useless feature in cameras that don't have a focusing ring on the lens barrel.  Picture quality is excellent, awesome dynamic range, great colors and resolution.  The problems come with the handling of this small camera.  It has 2 control dials, one on the lens barrel (controls things such as aperture or exposure compensation, not manual focus) and one to the right of the LCD screen.  The one on the lens barrel is very useful and easy to control, but the one on the back is easily rotated unintentionally and a bit too small to use with precision.  If you're not very careful, you can graze the dial by mistake and change the exposure.  The pop-up flash is also a bit of a nuisance.  Since the camera is small and doesn't have a grip on the body, one generally needs to hold it with your left index finger on top, which is where the flash pops up from!  I'm afraid it may even break if it tries to pop out and I'm pressing to hard on it.  Since it can be fully automatic, it may catch you by surprise.I think this camera is testing the limits of packing too many advanced features into a really small package.  Although I'm happy with it, I would probably be happier with a slightly larger camera, such as the G11, which would have the same high end features, be easier to handle and would add a hot shoe, which the S90 doesn't have.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent compact digital; even serious SLR photographers would appreciate this little one", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R6VO5SGQ0TZ74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an amateur photographer, I have been very disappointed by compact digital cameras for a long time until Canon released PowerShot S90. Here are the major reasons why buying the S90 was a no-brainer to me:(1) Smooth wheel-based dials for focus, aperture, shutter speed combined with a light meter and optional histogram right on the LCD, giving the photographer convenient manual control over image quality.(2) It enables digital negative (RAW) output. The file format is compatible with powerful editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.(3) Maximal aperture F2.0 + image stabilizer + a wide range of ISO = good performance in low light conditions. It also does macro shots well.(4) Decent overall build quality and performance of both the camera body and the lens, in both picture and video modes. Just as expected for a Canon PowerShot.I purchased this camera along with a small carrying case (Caselogic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage) and an extra battery (Maximal Power DB CAN NB-6L Replacement Battery for Canon Digital Cameras/Camcorders) on Amazon.com. Have been very happy with this combination. I carry the camera around daily, confidently knowing that it will do a good job capturing random interesting scenes in life. Currently I am considering a polarizer lens filter as the next add-on. Due to the popularity of this camera, more and more useful accessories are expected to further enhance the camera's usefulness.Below are a few features I wish to change/improve on this camera, from a dSLR user's perspective. Certainly it would be unreasonable (at least for now...who knows how far technology will bring us to in a few years?!) to expect a consumer-level, affordable compact digital camera to function like a dSLR without the bulk and heavy weight. Hence, the camera is still given 5 stars out of 5 in this review.(1) Smallest aperture is only F8. Would have been nice to have F16, or at least F11.(2) Noticeable noise at ISO400 onwards.(3) Shutter delay makes it very difficult to capture fleeting moments.(4) No HD video resolution as an option.(5) Some of the control features feel crammed. From time to time I accidentally turn the back wheel while pressing a button on the back side of the camera.(6) Does not work with external flashes (or maybe I just haven't found the needed accessory?). It would be very nice if this camera could wirelessly work with Canon SpeedLight flashes.

I did NOT want to compromise on image quality. Many of the cheaper compacts (including Canon's) have smaller pixels than my S3, which means more noise. The S90 has about the same pixel density as the S3, but boosts resolution from 6MP to 10MP. This helps make up for the S90's reduced zoom. The S90 is also much wider: 28mm vs. 36mm. No more backing up to get a scene to fit!The main reason I love the S90 is its fast 2.0 lens. I can take sharp pictures indoors without a flash and without a tripod. In other words, \"real life pictures\" look great. The videos also benefit from the lens. I doubt that the 720p videos from a $150 camera would look \"better\" than the 480p videos from the S90; resolution is just one measure of video quality.I had no problems handling the S90. There's a protrusion just under the mode dial that my thumb fits onto, and I could take pictures with one hand if I wanted to. Shooting with both thumbs under the camera feels the most stable and secure to me.I considered a lot of other cameras, but I'm very happy with the S90.

On the contrary, I take tons of fast shots, seldom well composed, not knowing what I might need as a reminder or for referencing, and all with 1 to 2 MB JPEG settings. What I need is speed: one photo after the next, and a fast start up. This camera does it.I also own 2 Nikon SLRs (D50 and D80 - and I love them) with various lenses.

You can take great wide angle photos inside (low light) and it has a features where you can stitch the photos together while you are taking them - well more or less.

The 3.8X lens is excellent at the center but a bit soft at the frame edges.  Ergonomics are inevitably difficult in such a small package, but Canon should have provided at least some front mechanical grip surface or some rubberized material.

It's a shame that ergonomic problems ruin what would otherwise be a fantastic camera.The shutter-release button is too far from the side for my finger to comfortably locate -- and has almost the same feel as surrounding buttons, so I often found that I thought I was pressing it while in fact I was pressing something else. On many occasions I accidentally pressed a dial that feels like a button but isn't.The flash is raised and lowered by a motor on the other side, and is located exactly where you would want to hold the camera. So if you're holding the camera comfortably and it wants to raise the flash, it will become confused by your finger holding it down and will require a reboot. And when the flash is raised, the camera becomes a bit awkward to hold.Another major drawback: its CR2 RAW images cannot be viewed in Aperture (and, I suspect, many other apps). This will probably be corrected with a patch in a few months, but until then, you have to convert all of your images to Adobe DNG. Fortunately, Adobe's DNG Converter is a free download, both for Windows and Mac.

I purchased the S90 as a primary camera for snorkeling (coupled with the Canon housing).  Although I have not used it for that purpose yet, I have had a chance to play around with the camera a little.  First, I will get the negatives out of the way.  I have big hands, and handling this camera is somewhat a put-off.  It is small and it feels like you are going to inadvertently touch buttons all the time.  This will not be a problem in the underwater housing, but I have determined it as a drawback at this point...now on to the good.This camera takes great pictures.I was shooting my puppy this morning.  He was moving around a bit, and the lighting was shifting between window sunlight and tungsten light.  I decided I would need to kick up the ISO, but I was reserved with this camera.  I sometimes shoot up to 5200 with the Mark II, but I decided to stop at 400 on the S90 with the small sensor.  I set the camera into manual, got my bearings on control (which took all of 5 seconds to figure out aperture and shutter knobs), and started to pop off a few shots.  You pick the aperture with the front ring.  I set this to f7.0 (I have a dachshund, so he is long and I wanted him all in focus).  I then used the wheel on the back to set the shutter speed.  The one thing I noticed was the live view on the camera back responded immediately.  I also own an Olympus PEN, and a Leica Dlux-4, but the Canon takes the cake with its very responsive live view and beautiful screen.  I grabbed my Mac and imported the RAW photos into iphoto (much quicker than lightroom for inport and previewing).  I was amazed as I pixel peaked around the image.  This camera does a very nice job with the small sensor.  It is as good or better than the Leica with color photos (B&W; will probably be another issue as that is where the Dlux-4 excels).  No adjustments would be necessary, even on the RAW images.  The sensor is fantastic for its size.Overall, this is a VERY fun camera to operate (more than I can say for the Leica or PEN).

Gable \"Nikon Nerd\"", "ReviewID": "RPHD9SLELOZSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit, I'm a camera junkie.  Photography is one of several hobbies I enjoy.  I have owned several Nikon cameras from DSLRs to Point and Shoot (P&S;) over the last few years.  My current Nikon DSLR does an excellent job in low light photography, but there are times when I prefer not to carry around a large camera.  I've been doing some research over the last 2-3 years and kept my eye on Nikon and Canon reviews.  Canon was consistently showing well in my research.  I knew I wanted a P&S; that had low light capability, PSAM modes, be able to shoot RAW, and have a wide angle lens.After much research and reading reviews and comments on photography sites and here on Amazon, I selected the Canon S90.  I purchased this camera back in June of this year (2010) and this has been one amazing P&S; camera.I carry this camera in my purse and it basically goes everywhere with me.  I never want to miss that Kodak moment.  I also purchased the Canon PSC-900 deluxe leather hard case to keep the camera protected while in my purse.I've also purchased the Canon WP-DC35 underwater housing for this camera.  My hubby and I enjoy snorkeling and take lots of underwater pictures.  We have previous experience with an older Nikon P&S; with an underwater housing that we've used for four years, so we're looking forward to putting this S90 to the underwater test in the next month.  I will be back to post the results.Overall, this is a wonderful camera that has met my needs and requirements.  It does a fantastic job in low light situations.  I've taken pictures in the house with natural light, semi-dark restaurants (pictures of the food...what can I say), in our church (where it's difficult for most cameras to get good results), and during the evening hours with limited light.  The results have been remarkable.  I can't compare the S90 to my Nikon DSLR as I would be comparing apples to oranges.  While the S90 is not in the same league as a DSLR, it does a heck of a job when there is limited light available.I've used the P (Program), A (Aperture), and S (Shutter) modes.  Mostly, I shoot in P-mode as I prefer not to use the flash and I can adjust exposure, ISO, WB, etc.  Setting the camera to Auto will automatically pop the flash up (when I don`t need it).  That's annoying to me.  So, when I'm in a low-light environment and I shoot in P-mode with no flash, I have to hold the camera steady.  Like hold-my-breath steady.If I can take a picture without flash, I'm a happy camper.  In the P&S; world, the flash is often too harsh on the object.  For me, the flash can make things dull, washed out, or highlight something that doesn't need to be noticed.  That's why low-light capability was high on my list.It took me a short time to get used to the Canon menu.  I really like having the dial or \"ring\" feature on the front of the camera (around the base of the lens) and well as the small one on the back of the camera.  I have not had any problems with accidently moving the dials.  I suppose that's the result of always checking my camera screen/settings before snapping away.The lens range on the S90 is perfect for my needs.  I have not had a moment where I wished the lens could do more.  I've taken over 1000 pictures from pictures of people (portraits) to buildings and landscapes/scenes to pictures of my hobbies (e.g. knitting).I've been averaging about 250 shots per battery charge.  I have purchased a spare battery and actually found it came in handy several times when I ran out of juice in the middle of a photo opportunity.  I noticed when the battery went from full to medium charge, it drained quickly after that.So after 6 months of use, I can honestly say this is close to a high-end P&S; with all the features this camera has and capable of doing.  I really like having the PSAM modes available to me as well as on the fly adjustments to exposure, white balance, ISO, etc.** Update 01/29/11 **I've added a review on the Canon underwater housing that I used with this camera.

For these purposes, this camera has far surpassed my expectations. Though I haven't tried the video function yet, here are my 2 cents on taking pictures with this camera -The camera itself came in small package full of big surprises. The camera size is so small that it kept slipping off my hands when I initially started using it, but over time I got used to the small form factor, and started using the strap for additional safety. One big plus of a small form is that it lets me conveniently slip it into my pocket looking no bigger than a regular wallet.There's no viewfinder on the camera, so the LCD screen is the only way of viewing pictures with the camera, which works well considering it's size. The only new feature for me was the use of 2 adjustable rings in the front (around the lens) and on the back (around the menu buttons). I thought these 2 rotating rings to adjust focus and ISO (functions change depending on what setting is being used, of course you can assign custom functions to these rings as required) is a very useful feature once you get used to them.In low light, switch to the preset \"low light\" option esp. while taking indoor pictures. The results have been the best I have ever seen on any other camera I used so far. In fact, the results were so flattering, in one case compared to a Nikon Digital SLR owned by a relative of mine, that he immediately placed an order for S95, the newer version.More updates to follow this review as I keep discovering newer features.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "great cam", "Author": "Adam D", "ReviewID": "R3KEROI9LKJKLF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not quite a pocket cam, which is frustrating.

I have had the camera for about a month now, and wouldn't say I have mastered it but am familiar enough to navigate the appropriate settings I need for certain shots.I purchased this camera because I had lost my Canon sd870, which I LOVED!  I wanted something still small and portable but with a little more manual control.  And this camera definitely has that.The reason for the 4 stars is; unfortunately I mostly use my camera for marco shots to take photos of products, and have found the macro setting to be pretty disappointing.  In the auto mode the camera really struggles to focus most of the time when it \"automatically\" chooses the macro mode.  So I mostly have to use the program setting to shoot in macro and even then the lighting has to be just right and the object and camera have to be completely steady, and even then it will still struggle to focus.  I recently went on a camping trip and was trying to take some macro shots of flowers and plants and couldn't get the camera to focus in macro mode to take a good shot to save my life!  I tried fooling with the settings and nothing was working:(The disappointing thing is that my sd870 shot so well in macro mode and I could get really close to products or items.  With the s90 you have to be at least 2\" from the product/item that you are shooting, and usually I cant even get that close.  I am really wondering if its user error, individual camera error, or just a lack of design for this particular model.But overall this is a great camera and I find it pretty easy to use, the auto function is awesome (except for the macro in my experience) and I would say landscape shots come out the best.

The body is slippery but you can hold it steady easily, specially if using both hands. It is a little bigger that what I was especting, but I guess this is as small as they can go to maintain image quality and usability.About the image quality: it is beautiful! Colours are incredible, the wideangle end of the zoom is very wide, the focal range is versatile and it has good low light performance, although noise can be a problem in specially challenging conditions and with no tripod.Macro capability is good in my opinion. I think the reason they added the Hybrid IS macro stabilization in the S95 is to allow lower ISO values on low light macro shots. This may be useful for some people.This camera encourages the use the P/A/S/M modes, rewarding you with great shots, which is good for people who are interested in learning more about photography. The controls are well thought out and the interface is really nice. The mode dial is a little too stiff tough.In conclusion, I really love this camera. It is still a compact, so don't expect dSLR performance in difficult conditions (fast paced action, very low light).

It fits in a pocket much more conveniently and takes better pictures.  Unfortunately the flash placement is a real issue.  After months of use I still nearly drop the camera when the flash pops up under my left index finger unexpectedly.  The cord also lacks a wrist-stop which doesn't help the near-dropping situation.  I swapped wrist straps with my older S70 to fix this.  The camera body also has more plastic components than the earlier cameras in the series.  My S70 has a sizable dent in its body, but it still functions like new.  I'm not so sure the S90 would survive a similar impact.  The HDMI port is a cool addition too.The interface is improved with the addition of the two rings for controlling various settings like aperture, zoom, shutter speed, iso, etc...

Hiris", "ReviewID": "R1B3BQJFW3LWQ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Now that I had this camera for a while, I have to update my review. The main reason I got this camera is for the size, availability of the underwater case, and manual controls.Here are some of the selling points of the camera and their shortcomings:- Manual controls: while great, there are limitations like no Bulb mode, and no way to set the exposure for longer than 15 seconds.- F/2.0 (and other aperture findings): f/2.0 only available at wide angle 6 mm (28 mm equivalent). All the way zoomed in at 105 mm equivalent that aperture is 4.9. While the large aperture is nice for low light, it has shortcomings when it comes down to the length of the depth of field (DOF) because of the small sensor size. It's usually a very long depth of field. At F/2.0 the DOF on this camera is the equivalent of the DOF at ~f/9.2 in a full frame camera. This might not be a limitation if you only plan to take story-telling photos in which everything can be seen clearly but if you want to create the perception of depth with a nice bokeh (the blurry parts) without macro-mode, forget it, it's no good.- F/37 equivalent DOF for smallest aperture (f/8). Basically you get more details in less light so that's an advantage but be careful about the diffraction. At that tiny aperture diffraction eats up the sharpness like a big evil monster that it is.- Sensor size: while bigger than most point-and-shoots and equivalent Nikons, it is still small.- RAW mode - great to have RAW files from a camera this size.- Fastest shutter speed is 1/1600 which is not enough in bright light or if you want to do HDR in very bright light.- Speed - less than 1 frame per second is really slow. Kind of annoying capturing static images in action shots.- AEB - Auto Exposure Bracketing - Nice that it has it but has issues. You can choose it in aperture priority mode but then the photo is metered and if you want to adjust the center exposure up or down, it doesn't move the whole bracket so you end up with something like +2 0 and -1 or +1 0 and -2. That can be adjusted by metering somewhere else in the photo (half press of the shutter button) and then re-composing while holding the shutter pressed half way down and taking the shot but it's still annoying.- Focus points - you can only focus in the center or use face detection (lame). The above mentioned trick of focusing with the subject centered while holding the shutter button down half-way and then recomposing and completely pressing the button works.- The dial on the front for manual controls - I really like this. I wish other cameras would have that too.- Macro mode - you can't get close enough to the subject. The minimum focus distance is very far for good macro shots.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera with slight adjustment of holding it.", "Author": "Ron in San Diego", "ReviewID": "R24CAGA1AMGZSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to assume that the folks who have had problems with this camera either have not completely read the manual that comes with it or are too quick on the trigger for shooting (all digital cameras need a second to focus properly before fully depressing the button), or they received a lemon (which is why companies provide warranties) and they should have either return the camera to Amazon, as defective, for a replacement or to Canon for fixing.  I have found Canon Service to be Excellent over the years.  I have used them on a couple of occasions.  On one, the camera was well over a year out of warranty, the cost to me was going to be about $149 to fix.  After they received it, they wrote to me that this was a component that has been failing, and should not, and thus there would be no charge for the service.  Now, I can not ask for a more honest, customer oriented manufacturer than these folks.Now, it is true that because there is a \"popup\" flash, I needed to learn to hold the camera differently.  The way Canon suggested is Great as it gives me, and the camera, far more stability than the old way. I did use my left hand finger on top of the camera in a pincer hold with my other fingers.  Now, it is cradled in my left hand between my thumb and second finger with the first finger cradled along the side of the lens giving me far less shake.  By the way, this flash sure does light things up far better than my other cameras with the built in flash on the front!!!Thus far, the zoom shots have been awesome, everyone is raving about the quality of the pictures I have taken of them,, Low light shots are unbelievably clear as if I was using a flash and the day shots are great.

The camera takes great pictures - especially in low light.  But that is not worth the trade-off of a very poor design.  The biggest design flaw is the pop up flash, which is located on the top left corner right where you put your finger to hold it.  This has broken 3 times so far.  You can train yourself to not hold the camera there, but if anyone else uses your camera, the flash will likely get broken when it tries to raise while a finger is there.Another design flaw is the very easy to turn rear control wheel.  This gets easily turned while taking pictures, which can change the settings of your current picture or video mode inadvertently.  I was able to solve this problem by adding a custom grip.  (Do a search on Canon S90 custom grip and you will find the same one.)  Beware if you add this grip the camera will no longer fit in the underwater housing.Another design flaw is the placement of the shutter release button - it's not in a natural position.  If you ask someone to take your picture you have to show them where the button is or they will end up pressing another button.The last design flaw is that the camera has a really hard time focusing in low light conditions.  I have so many really blurry nighttime people shots.  I'm not sure why this camera is so much worse than any other compact camera on the market in this regard.I really wanted this camera to work.

Anyhow I went ahead and ordered this camera after reading numerous reviews about the low light picture capabilities. And I must say I was 100% satisfied by the picture quality. This camera takes excellent pictures in low light without flash. Pictures at ISO 1600 are usable and excellent with very little noise. Daytime pictures are excellent as well. The amount of details this camera captures is amazing. Another feature I liked is the Nostalgic scene mode. Taking pictures in this mode is like stepping back into time wow! Some people might say that this can be achieved in PhotoShop; but who has the time?The only complain I have is about build quality and ergonomics. The fit & finish and grip of this camera could certainly have been better. It somehow feels flimsy in your hands. One side of the camera does not have grip and on the other side there is a possibility of the flash popping up! I hope the flash mechanism doesn't give up after some time since your finger is on it much of the shooting time.  Anyways these are not big trade offs for the picture quality. I think the reason for a pop-up flash is keeping it far away (even by few millimeters) from the lens so as to reduce red eye as much as possible. I read somewhere that keeping the flash as far away from lens reduces red-eye.Yes there are aftermarket grips available but I don't want to spend another $35 on top of the expensive camera price.In a nutshell go for it if you shoot in low light.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Too many features for a point and shoot", "Author": "M.

But if you just want to take some quick-n-easy snapshots of the kids or whatnot, then the extra features this camera provides, and their cost, aren't really worth it. Casual users would do much better to get the PowerShot SD780IS which is, as I write this, less than half the cost of this camera.If, on the other hand, you can't live without Tv, Av, full manual control and a fast lens, then you absolutely need this camera.I normally shoot using a DSLR, and a while back I carried an SD870IS with me everywhere. At the time it was the best pocket camera I could find, but I lamented the lack of full manual control. This camera takes care of that problem.Of course by now you have heard about the dial on the front of this camera. Combined with the dial in back this camera has excellent, fast control. I normally shoot in Av, use the front dial for manual focus, and use the back dial for aperture. It allows me to set up the shot very quickly. From pocket to shot is usually just a couple seconds.This camera does have its flaws: ISO 400 is a little noisy. The back dial can be rather over-sensitive (I've accidentally changed settings a couple times). It's a bit hard to hold. The included software is pretty bad, but it gets the job done. But these are all minor complaints. All in all I am very pleased with this camera.Unfortunately the camera I got had a small sensor flaw and I've had to have it replaced. I won't hold this against the camera or Canon, flaws do happen, but I would expect a little better quality control in a camera of this cost. I recommend taking a lot of test images to make sure yours works flawlessly. The particular problem I had was revealed with a 1\" exposure in darkness.There have been a lot of complaints about this camera not having HD video. That seems to me like complaining about a bicycle not having 4 wheel drive. Video is not what this camera is about. And no pocket camera takes video with the kind of quality HD should have. What's the point of adding more pixels to an already grainy image? If you want an HD camcorder go buy one.

As many other commenters have pointed out, the range of features is remarkable in such a small, well-constructed camera, but there are several modest but significant frustrations which keep me from giving this a great rating:1. Low light performance - yes, it's possible to capture images in amazingly low light, but at ISO above 1000 the noise is overwhelming and requires major post-processing to get a final image that doesn't look like it was taken with a cell phone.2. The adjustment wheel on the back - it's just a completely bone-headed move by Canon to have the adjustment wheel spin freely - truly idiotic and unlike Canon's normal smart design - I am constantly changing the exposure adjustment by accident and feel like I need to babysit the thing constantly to make sure a brush of a finger or cheek hasn't changed settings without my noticing.3. Movie mode - the low-res quality is sub-par for the current era (much cheaper cameras shoot higher res video) and it's inexcusable to not include time-lapse video functionality4. No flash hot shoe - personal choice, but some may find the lack of a flash hot shoe a significant omission.The S90 has a good sensor and packs an amazing array of features into a truly pocketable camera, but I am looking forward to an S100 soon that addresses my concerns above before I would give a real rave.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Janelle \"Janelle\"", "ReviewID": "R2EDMGCJW3IEP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I are amazed at the quality of pictures this camera takes.

Only four stars for portability, and only because I know that there are smaller cameras that fit more easily into a pocket.  You may  find this one to be a little tight in your front pants pocket.  I'm am quite pleased with the portability, however.  I bought a Canon case over the internet that I am quite pleased with.  It's called a canon PSC-900, and it's made for this camera.  Check out the reviews on amazon.com.  It's very low profile, and looks great. I gave two stars for the battery because the battery life is quite disappointing.  Today was the first day that I used the camera.  I didn't take many photos.  I'd guess maybe fortyish.  I did tinker with it last knight, exploring its various functions.  Today, I turned it off and on repeatedly, took photographs, and tried several different functions.  Next thing I knew, the battery icon was down to one bar, and blinking.  The battery life on my old Canon G1 puts this to shame.  Sure, it has a bigger battery.  But, hey, it's a old camera.  What happened to modern advances.  Even so, I don't plan to return the camera.  I'll just buy a back-up battery, and take my charger with me when I travel.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, I am very happy with this camera - so far.  I'm just an amateur photographer.  I take snapshots at family gatherings, etc.  But there's another part of me... my inner Ansel Adams, maybe an inner Cartier-Bresson, that yearns to breathe free.  I even bought an expensive film camera some time ago in the hopes that it might stir something deep inside me.  I bought an enlarger, too (with all that goes with it), so as to exercise complete creative control over the finished product.  No more letting those labs guys at Savon (or wherever) make me look like an amateur.  Well, unfortunately, I usually don't have my fancy film camera with me.  It's a hassle lugging it around, and it's hard to be discreet with that camera.  Also, I'm afraid I'll get mugged for my camera by some crackhead while I'm exploring my inner street photographer.  Oh, yea.  I still haven't taken the enlarger out of the box -and it's been a long time since I bought it.  A very long time.  The S90 was a breath of fresh air.  I really enjoyed taking pictures with it, today.  I was able to mingle with the crowd, and go pretty much unnoticed.  I took a few pictures that I was fairly happy with, and I thought the camera was easy to use.  With a little practice, I'll should be able to master its many features.  It has lot of good features that allow for creative control - and for such a small camera.  I printed out several of today's photos, and I was impressed by the image quality.  It feels solid, too.  It feels like a quality product.  I haven't used the software, yet.  So far, I've just used my basic Iphoto program, and tinkered with the photos a little.  I'm very pleased with the video, too.  I know, I know.  It isn't HD.  Hey, who am I?  Steven Speilberg?  I don't think so.  I'm not filming Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I'll just use it for small video clips of family and friends - treasured memories, to bring a smile to my face.  You know, I'll bet a talented, creative, photographer could make some amazing pictures on this camera.  Also, if I had the best camera money could buy, I'll bet my photos would still reveal me to be an amateur.  I think, for most people, this is a camera that they can have a lot of fun with, and take the occasional photo that they can feel quite proud of.

I regret this purchase so much!", "Author": "Danish", "ReviewID": "R34YQWQ28I3T0I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a Panasonic LX3 before this camera. My beloved LX3 got ruined in a dust storm and I bought this camera b/c it was newer and had a comparable lens and sensor. I also bought it b/c it was smaller than the Lx3 and therefore, pocketable. the LX3 could fit into a jacket or khaki pants, but not jeans.So when I received it, I was hugely disappointed. It's cheap plastic! The nice ring that I was excited about where you can adjust it for different functions is a cheap plastic ring that makes a cheap plasticky sound when you turn it. It's just hideous. It's small and slick, but that's exactly the problem. With no handle, it can fall out of your hands very easily! I feel very nervous taking pictures with the S90 with one hand, whereas, with the LX3, it felt extremely comfortable and I had no worries with shooting with one hand.Also, I think the biggest thing I miss from the LX3 is the ratio. The S90 is limited to a 4:3 ratio. Yeah, it has 16:9, but all it does it chop the 4:3. The Lx3 on the other hand, had true 3:2 and 16:9 ratios - they weren't just cropped versions of the 4:3 ratio like the Canon S90. With that in mind, I find the 28mm wide end EXTREMELY limiting. The LX3 is wider at 24mm, but also has 3:2 and 16:9 ratio, which makes the wide angle even better. I hate the limited ratio aspect of the S90. Hate it! I so wish I had just rebought the Lx3 instead of trying out a new camera.I am rating this 2 stars for it's category. Yeah, it's definitely better than cheaper cameras in regards to image quality, but compared to the Lx3, it's a dud.Go for the LX3... or even check out the soon to be released Samsung TL500 which has a 1.8 lens!", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "A not a very good camera, a poor design !!!", "Author": "Nelson Shoji Shishito", "ReviewID": "R36VMPRV73OBW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just bought an S90 for me based on the reviews of the quality and some nice features like the lens aperture and the sensor used.

Any person will tend to put the finger over the flash causing it to lock the mechanism. Of course I learned and now changed the position I hold the camera. The issue is that you can't ask anyone to take a picture because his finger will be on the flash and if the flash activates it will lock, and eventually break the mechanism. It's amazing that canon did not realized that at design phase, this is a serious problem and create a weakness on the camera that limit the use in real life situations.If you will be the only user you can adapt and take very good pictures.In my case I'm very disappointed, after all this is a 400USD camera that's being rated one of the best.I don't recommend to buy this camera due to reliability issues specially if your intent is also to ask other people to take pictures also.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is the one You've been looking for", "Author": "Tokugawa Ieyasu \"Careful Buyer\"", "ReviewID": "RKFJBHK7Z4VI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When all is said and done, you want a compact camera that takes sharp photos.

Since when did individualism become an imperfection?) Overall this is a nice camera and, as with most of Canon's line, most of the features will be rather familiar. Aside from the flash being a rather awkward place, the camera will satisfy most buyers. I bought this camera several months ago and began taking pictures in various modes and scenes, and I also took the same pictures with my Canon PowerShot SD800 IS.  Before buying the S90, I also tried the SD980 IS. I've been using Canon PowerShot cameras for more than a decade and after taking over 2000 test shots, I feel confident in saying that Canon's current product line is nothing short of a disappointment. It's hit or miss... (As a non sequitur, under no circumstances can you use AUTO mode! You MUST turn the mode dial and use the adjustable settings.)Shortly after the first few test shots, I contacted Canon customer support because I noticed that the newer cameras (mentioned above) did not have SUPER FINE jpeg compression. A representative told me that their Japanese developers have eliminated the SUPER FINE compression ratio and all their cameras have only FINE and NORMAL compression. That would be like buying an HDTV that only displayed SD. Yes, I know, the common user WILL NOT notice a difference...(as someone else pointed out in their review). ***Similarly, I know plenty of people who can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p.If you buy this, or any of Canon's current product line, be warned, most of your pictures will come out severely noisy, flat, blurry and unfocused. Indoor shots are not acceptable; however, outdoor shots (taken on a clear day) came out looking really nice. Some of the reviews here are from people who either do not have the \"eye\", or have limited knowledge of Canon's previous camera line. However, don't take my word for it, drop the money and see for yourself. If you have a trained eye, you'll see it! Again, if you allegorize this to HD movies, there are still plenty of folks out there who cannot tell the difference between a Standard Def movie and a High Def one.Before buying this camera, do you research! Go to Canon's Website and peruse their current line; you can also download the PDF instruction booklet. Look through the documentation and search for their JPEG compression; if you only see \"fine\" and \"normal\" then don't buy it if that is important to you! Canon has really proven to be a disappointment to their most loyal consumers. I understand this camera also records in RAW format, which I haven't discussed here, but that is great for anyone who wants to go into post-editing all the time. It does provide a wider range of post-editing options, however in my experience, the images still looked very much the same. (Users can record each shot in RAW+JPEG.)I realize this is a P&S;, but I've had P&S; cameras in the past that produce much better images than this one, with colors more vibrant, lines sharper, better contrast with more depth. I realize this review is going to get bashed but at least I'm not just restating all the positives that have already been stated in countless other online review site, and at least I ACTUALLY OWN the camera (some people post reviews and don't even own the item!).

I really was about to take the Canon. But I went to a store and compared the two in hand. Without a doubt, the LX3 won me over. The S90 felt cheap, overly too-simplified, and looked cheap. I am not commenting on use nor quality of photos. I know LX3 already has a great reputation, felt solid in my hand, and looked like a more serious camera. I really didn't think I'd be swayed by the superficial looks, but as the S90 was pretty unknown and I had a bad experiences with recent Canons, I decided the LX3 was for me. Don't get me wrong: I love Canons, and I had a fantastic one (S30). But for some reason, Canon's point and shoots started to go downhill for me. The quality wasn't as sharp, and they seemed to just die on me suddenly (I also owned the Canon A95).After feeling the LX3 in hand, and then the S90, I knew I had to take the LX3. Sure, there are some inconveniences of the LX3 (lens cap, protruding lens, having to go through a menu of items), but I know I will have a tried and true camera (with a Leica lens, nonetheless!), and a resellable camera if needed (which I don't ever plan to sell!).I highly recommend that those undecided between these cameras go and see them in a store. I went to J+R.PS: I'm not a professional photographer, but I like a camera I can grow into, with custom settings, and can take everywhere with me.

What's a bit insipid about this is that the camera's LCD screen does not show this, it actually corrects the image for display on the screen. But, transfer the picture to your computer and it will look distorted.
