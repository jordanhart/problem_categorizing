This was an Xmas gift from husband, and we got it from Cameta Camera at a good price.  I did return for store credit the Card and the Backpack.  I rated the Camera plus Lens as five star all around, but since this review is about the whole package, I dropped off one Star because the Backpack does not fit the Camera and this Lens comfortably.  It is a good looking bag but just not the right size for a large camera and long lens.  Cameta in my opinion would better serve its customers by upgrading the Backpack and removing all the other extras.  I am still searching for a good backpack.  Right now using the Case Logic messenger camera bag sold on Amazon.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Whole Package is Great - Two Items Not That Good", "Author": "Georges Rehbane", "ReviewID": "RNYB0NDH8IJRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The whole package is great for me. I'm new to photography so I can't provide a decent review on the camera or the lens. However, two things I dislike are: 1- the LCD screen protector is not practical. It didn't last one day on the LCD screen and 2- The memory card bundled in this package is not among Nikon's certified list. I got it working for an hour before it stopped working. The reseller offered me a replacement card but I guess I'll ask to pay the difference and get a SanDisk as it is among the certified Nikon memory cards.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Budding photographer", "Author": "Denise Vyse", "ReviewID": "R149JMEEMCVYKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Mr. thinks he's a professional now. Bundle came with everything described. Everything works and is exactly what we expected. The backpack has many protective inserts that easily remove to allow you to adjust everything to your preferences.
