This camera was a great purchase.  I have had the camera for two days and taken over 500 pictures with both of the lenses.  It is very easy to figure out and with some experimentation I have taken some very quality photos.  Nothing in this kit is cheap or flimsy and it is well packaged and absolutely stuffs the carrying case.  I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting quality photos without spending thousands of dollars.  The software is easy and downloading photos is even easier.  I chose this product because of the price, the lenses included and the 32 GB card.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "My First Nikon", "Author": "Gpack", "ReviewID": "RO7018A4UGNWN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Cannon user all my life until recently when I switched my photography products to Nikon. No particular reason for doing so. I just wanted to get the Nikon user experience and compare for myself the differences. To begin, I am an amateur photographer, capturing anything and everything entices' my eyes. When I am at leisure I try different shooting modes, but when I am with kids or with family, it is always in \"auto mode\". Thus far, I have shot 900 pictures  and a few videos. I am pleased with the performance of my Nikon D3200.1. Ease of use. Great convenience.2. Not too heavy3. Turn on is less than 4-5 seconds so you don;t miss a moment. Continuos shooting mode is awesome, so camera doesn't take the extra few seconds recuperate between shots.4. Auto Mode takes care of all shooting incompetencies5. Need an \"power conveyer ($10)\" when charging battery outside US.6. 9 Point focus is awesome to capture the subject in the frame, even if your eye is not directly looking at the subject.7. Love the package accessories and deals from the seller.8. Long battery life.9. If you are looking for a family camera. This is it. Worth the price.10. 55-200 MM lens takes care of most of your shooting needs. I affixed a wide angle lens on top of my 18-55 MM to avoid changing lenses. It works just fine for both close up shots and zoom in shots.Seller have different package deals for you select, depending on what you would do most with your camera. Take your time, write down what your are priorities are with your camera, do the research, compare packages within seller and compare sellers and buy.I am pleased with my purchase thus far.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best deal for D3200", "Author": "Peter Ravenkamp \"Bigpete\"", "ReviewID": "R6R9Z8JUFVQ5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone knows how great the camera is, the the bundle options will drive you crazy. This one was by far the best. The bag was actually a Nikon bag so the camera and lens fit perfect. The tripod is full height (not a short tabletop one). The sd card is 32gb and that is a huge plus with this camera.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R34DUN66HU0YUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super easy to use and with professional quality!
