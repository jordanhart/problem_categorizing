{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice System", "Author": "Scott M. Sargent \"Scott\"", "ReviewID": "R1OIR9OFEK7A19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This security system (being the only one I own), seems to provide all I need for a home security system.  The cameras are not the best, but for the price they are ok.  A bit grainy but ok.  My biggest complaint is the lack of documentation.  After mutteling around on the internet and youtube, I was able to find what I need.  The cables that come with the system are nice and work well, however I find that drilling a 3/4\" hole to get the BNC Cable through can be troublesome. So, I purchased a CAT 5 cable and the necessary ends watched youtube videos and saw how to make my own cable.  This way, I only have to fish a small line through the wall and it does not have to be a hole 3/4\" wide.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's ok!", "Author": "Eduardo", "ReviewID": "R2KGXFB00JYK2E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's analog technology, but works fine.
