{"Reviews": [{"Title": "These are slick, just make sure you have a compatible crimper!", "Author": "B. Williams", "ReviewID": "R188GRWPL8B5ZA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We use these quite a bit, both for terminating cables in video headends and for DS3 cables.  One thing to be aware of is they only work with certain crimpers.  We have had the best luck with crimpers with interchangeable, adjustable bits.  The small, simple crimpers you would use for normal RG-6 F compression connectors don't usually work as the barrel on these is too wide and the connector is too long.  But with the right tool they are very handy.  You don't have to mess with multiple pieces like with a traditional crimp style BNC, or worry about measuring correctly, etc.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Terminates cables for CCTV cameras or other video applications quickly and easily\nPatented design with 360-degree cable gripping sleeve and watertight O-ring\nFull gold contacts for low signal loss\nIncludes slip on color bands for easy cable identification", "Name": "Paladin Tools 9740 SealTite BNC Compression Connectors, for RG6 AND RG6 Quad, 50-Pack", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31mukv3AgmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000Z99IS6"}}
