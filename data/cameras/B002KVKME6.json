For $10 more, I walked away with an easy-to-use, basic camera for her to keep... and I wind up using it a lot myself.The positives: Small size, carabiner so you can clip it on belt or pocketbook strap.  Does movies, takes SDMemory, has padded exterior to survive drops, comes with cable to connect to TV, has about 2 hours of life per charge.Negatives: Digital zoom only, screen is a little dim in bright sunlight.Overall: Better than expected.  I'm buying two for my facilities people at work.  Can't beat it for the price!!!", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't be fooled into thinking this is ruggedly constructed", "Author": "Stephen Casey", "ReviewID": "R1ZXZIZ8SJ2O0T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera looks like it might be built to take a bit of abuse, but I discovered this is not the case. My daughter got it as a birthday gift (she is 8), and within an hour, I saw her drop it from about waist level (maybe 2 feet?) onto a wood floor. She gave an \"Oh, no!\", but I thought certainly this was not the type of drop that would break it. I've dropped regular compact digital cameras from worse, with no harm done.But it turns out that this drop did in fact break something inside, as evidenced by a rattling noise, which turned out to be the on/off switch (apparently the actual switch underneath the plastic on/off button, because there was no visible damage that we could see from the outside, but pushing the on/off button there was no resistance or the \"click\" feel that was there before the incident).I actually took apart the camera carefully to see what was going on, and found that all the switches are held on by their solder connections to the camera circuit board, nothing else. Think of it like a shelf on a wall, and every time you press the button, you are pushing down on the shelf, but the shelf is only held onto the wall by tiny solder connections. Just an intrinsically poor design for the mechanicals. I'm not surprised other buyers have had lots of failures of the buttons and other parts. Inside it is a very cheaply constructed product, wrapped in a \"rugged\" looking package.", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "is NOT water resistant", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1HSFPE55FMG6R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "- is NOT water resistant, probably is like fog or sneeze resistant, but not water- is like an old cell phone camera, the colors aren't bright- the interface is very slow- the shot is to slow, so the fotos aren't clear if the people is moving, laughing, or talking", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Problem Camera???", "Author": "Kay E.

Schumann", "ReviewID": "R1ER5QRRPHDZ5R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this for my son for his birthday last year, figuring it would be nice and sturdy.  The first issue was that the LCD screen was so dark, you couldn't tell if the photos came out until downloading to the computer.  But, we could live with that.  The big issue is that the rechargeable battery in the camera is not something that can be replaced at home.  The battery stopped holding a charge after about 6 months.  We sent the camera in under warranty, and got a replacement.  The replacement camera battery charged only once and then stopped working.  Of course, now we are out of the warranty period.  My thought is don't buy this camera unless you are looking for an expensive paper weight.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "poor", "Author": "ABC", "ReviewID": "R3DEMZKMSX2JX3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this for my kid.

It has been a great starter camera for him. Very clear pics, easy to use, and YES durable. I don't know why these other people are complaining that theirs broke easy. This camera has been dropped, sat on, buried in the sand at Coco Beach, left outside overnight (no rain but humidity was high) [by the way, waterproof does mean mist, fog, humidity, a sneeze; NOT that you can use it under water]; and still works as well as the first day. Now about the company, well I can't say much for their customer service. I have twice sent emails to them trying to find out where I can buy another of their cameras in St. Louis, MO and I have never received a response. And looking at other reviews from customers that have had problems with their cameras and try to get help with warranty issues; not looking so good. I still want to purchase another camera, I just can't find the 5 MP in blue or red (looking for one for my niece and you know how brothers and sisters can fight over items). I may have to settle for another green. I recently purchased a blue 3 MP (new, still in original package)and the camera battery would not take a charge. The USB/battery charger works on other devices, just not the camera it came with. The camera will take pics if I use the USB cable to connect it to the computer, but will NOT charge. I don't expect to get a good response from Argus when I try to get a replacement for the blue 3 MP. I'll will keep you all posted. Meanwhile, for the price (around $50), I recommend the green 5 MP very much.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera, bad battery", "Author": "C.

She uses it a lot and it takes pretty decent pictures. The only issue we have is the battery. It has stopped charging. Support seems good, as they are willing to repair/replace with absolutely no fuss. We're sending it in next week and I will update once we've received it.Pros:Easy to setup.Easy to use.Durable.Fun.Cons:Battery issues.All in all, a good little camera.

The built in memory holds a ton of lower res photos and the memory card format is extremely cheep to upgrade. My niece carried it all day long and ended up dropping it several times.

I broke the joystick in the first day. Do NOT move the joystick too hard. I think there is some year warranty but i did not notice. By looking at another person's review, i learned that they charge you $[...] for a replacement.Anyway its great in the day light but not very good in other times of the day. You can change the white balance by pressing the menu button, but that helps only a little. Another bad thing about this camera is that when you take a picture, It takes about 3 seconds to load. And where your aiming the camera after the 3 seconds is what the thing is going to take a picture of!

I just don't know why the adults wouldn't want it; Does it look to kiddie for them? I bought this because I used the camera on my phone and my phone broke back in October. I would be getting a new NICE phone in January, and my boyfriend gave me one of his old phones. works good as a phone but not as a camera and with the holidays coming up (and me with a 6 month old baby) I NEEDED SOMETHING to stand up to taking lots of photos (such as a digital camera. About 2 weeks after getting this (I had it in my purse) the screen cracked... I guess rattleing around in my purse was just to much for it. But that kind of situation makes me think maybe it wouldn't be such a great little camera for the kids. As far as now, the screen may be cracked (since its a LCD screen the \"crack\" is like a digital glitch in view ONLY)But it still takes pictures just fine and the quality of the pictures is still decent.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's hard to rate something you've never received - its now been 2 months", "Author": "Shannon And Darin Jensen", "ReviewID": "R15R7YV5KFDT18", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Company promised me a pre-Christmas delivery, which did not occur.
