Ramirez", "ReviewID": "R2U2E78G2XLXCA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can not believe that Crayola would put their name on this product - It works - but the quality is junk - My three year old son who can operate an adult point and shoot - played with it for two minutes and said \"Can I have a real camera please\".  Just buy your child a real camera and don't cheap out - As always you get what you pay for - We bought our son an inexpensive Canon and it not only works great, it takes the abuse of a three year old and keeps on working.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lame...disappointment for my son", "Author": "Jose M.M.", "ReviewID": "R2POSUF1KRILPC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We got this camera for my son since my daughter has a vtech camera. We thought that this would change things between the kids and maybe it would be easier for the little one to carry around. Well...boy were we amazed at the bad quality of picture (only 1) without the SD card. So once we put the card in...still it would only take one picture and then we needed to erase it or downoad it.  I strongly DO NOT recommend this. Dont waste your money. This is a very bad product.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2.1MP Three in one Green Digital Camera Video Camera Web Camera\nPreview Screen/EZ Grip Handles\nBuilt in Flash/Workshop to Make Photo Frames\nPhoto Editing Software\nEZ Grip Handles", "Name": "Sakar 25070 Green 2.1MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41kdiKAEewL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001GMHWV6"}}
