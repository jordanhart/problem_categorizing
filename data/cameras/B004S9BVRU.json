We bought it as a backup camera that we can keep in my wife's purse because we often forget the bigger camera.  We also let the kids use it to take their own pictures.  We weren't looking for anything high end when we bought it.  That being said, this camera works well.  Outdoor pictures come out bright and clean.  The flash is a little intense and the response time isn't great, but compared to any camera in this price range, I would rate it high.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Convenient, screwless removable faceplate system holds interchangeable cosmetic skins of any design from colors to gradients, patterns to images, to uniquely suit the photographer.\nChoose from 10 included skins, or create your own using PENTAX Personal Skin Designer software or skin stencil.\nInterchangeable colored lens rings compliment skin designs.\nUltra slim, lightweight, and pocketable for easy portability.\nHigh resolution 14 megapixel CCD records outstanding detail for large prints or cropping flexibility.", "Name": "Pentax Optio RS1500 14MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom and Interchangeable Face Plates (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51y6kd8c2EL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004S9BVRU"}}
