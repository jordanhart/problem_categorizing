{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent gear", "Author": "FrontPage", "ReviewID": "R2HGY8KCGJ3L3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful. I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with. First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera). I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch. Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above. I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results. The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this. Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations. For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable. In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue.", "Date": "February 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "James Comfort \"jim comfort\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q258TPL95AZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera in December, have had it since then, and it an amazing camera. First time I have ever had professional camera, and it takes time to learn how to use it. It is not a point and shoot camera. If you want large pictures and like to crop, this may not be the camera for you. However if you want the ability to take great pictures, and learn how to use a professional camera at a great price this is the one to buy.Ability to have custom curves, which means to have predetermined parameters for different conditions. Ability to chage ISO at random for different conditions.

I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great.

It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully.I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X.

Lowery \"Justintosh\"", "ReviewID": "R1TRJIYRWPNINH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the D2H, and make stunningly pleasing photographs with it daily, yes, in 2008. It really is a fantastic camera to use and enjoy. It may only have 4.1 MP, but the resulting RAW files are razor sharp and crisp, beautifully saturated, and nice and quick to download, copy, edit, upload, etc.Noise-wise, properly handled (expose properly, use lowest ISO necessary), this camera can easily compete with the D200, and match or beat the D2X.Quality-wise, countless people have made 13x19, 16x20, and even 24x36 prints from this camera with great results. Of course, it would be smart to use a tool like Genuine Fractals to ensure proper DPI, but that's really the case with any camera. The pixels interpolate beautifully, due to a weaker (that's a good thing) anti-aliasing filter on the sensor. Larger , newer sensors often have strong anti-aliasing filters meant to reduce noise, but as a side effect they blur the pixels slightly, reducing the sensor's resolving power. Without this filter being so strong, you can go up to large print sizes gracefully, with a sharp, film-like look, as opposed to pixelation. This coming from experience, not forum postings. :)I'm sure some technology nerd who's never made a decent photo in his life could find something to whine about with the specs (they always do), but real photographers can appreciate the speed, elegance, and pure utility of this camera.Moose Peterson raved about this camera, as did Thom Hogan, and Joe Buissink shot it as his main DSLR for years, doing high-end A-list celebrity weddings for $15-70,000 each. I think it's more than adequate for most of us. Photographers who have these and D200s and 300s have said that if they had a money shot, they'd trust the ease of use, clean design, and raw speed of their D2H to get the job done over even the brand new D300. There's just something to be said for the quality and ergonomics of a true pro body that has to be felt to be understood. And considering you can get one of these on Amazon for just $750... that's a pretty great deal.I can fit 2400 RAW on an 8 gig card, and shoot well... a TON of pics without running out of battery. In fact, I have yet run out of battery charge. I just shot a wedding with it, and none of my shots were noisy (I kept it to ISO 800 and lower), and after shooting all day, I'd only used 1/5 of the battery charge! And my battery is an older one!

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R1CKBFXBCLB63J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a D2H from a skateboarding magazine about 2 years ago, and to this day could not be happier with it, I replaced a D-1H that I carried in Iraq for a year with the D2H. The only problem taht the D-1H ever gave me was that the heat would destroy batteries, so I had my sister sending me new batteries every month.  Other than that, I carried it around with my full combat gear, and it was usually hanging from the turret in a Humvess.  The D-2H could have no doubt fared even better. The camera is built like a tank. I took mine out on the ocean in a small boat and it got wet and banged around quite a bit.  Another thing is I still use my Sunpak 522 flash and that flash would fry most cameras because of the voltage.  A lot of the problems people say that they have with digital cameras comes from simply not reading the manual, and just turning the camera on and shooting.  I still carry my dads copy of \"The Eastman Kodak Professional Photographers Guide\" in my bag and using the tables in that book and the D2H I have never gotten an over exposed or underexposed shot.  And I don't need to \"fix my photos\" because I learned to shoot on film where there is not really much fixing you can do to a photo.If you can find one of these in good shape I recommend buying it. Don't worry about the MP count being low, that's an effect of the high speed shooting.  The photos are still huge and I have made 5 20 x 30\" prints from the camera. By the way, I still use Picture Project to load my photos up.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera for those that want to move up to pro level on a bugdet", "Author": "LNHANSEN", "ReviewID": "RPXQ9RRI5VWFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "CAMERA CAME AS ADVERTIZED, VERY GOOD CONDITION.

The D2H achieves this speed by using a 4MP resolution, which even in the day wasn't very much.  It uses the same battery as the D3/D3S and the D700 battery grip, and takes compact flash cards.  It's a \"pro\" Nikon that will meter with manual lenses and can serve in a pinch, but there's some serious problems to consider before you use it:Noise at high ISO, \"high\" being 1600 but more practically 800.  It goes up to 6400 in extended mode if static is your thing.Color balance problems, especially with mixed lighting.  This plagued all the early Nikons, so if you have a room lit by light bulbs and a door is open to the outside the daylight will show as blue.And lastly, which for me was the deal breaker, shutter problems.  As the shutter wears out it develops the \"lazy first shot\" problem where your first shot creates an \"ERR\" message. Turn it off and back, and it's okay.  Let it sit for an hour and it happens again.  My example had this at 80,000 frames, but it's happened earlier and replacing the shutter is difficult, which is what killed mine.If you find one in good shape it'll make a good backup camera or one to use when it might get broken, but I can't recommend it for serious use today; even the pedestrian D300s is much better.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth Ten X's the Price!", "Author": "Marc Snyder", "ReviewID": "RLCUOVGQIT8SH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been in the photo business for over 35 years, working professionally all over the world.  My most recent assignment was taking \"element shots\" for the most recent Space Shuttle mission. I only add this to defend my qualifications.  While most of you reading this probably won't be using the camera in outer space, it is worth noting that should you find yourself needing to capture the moment beyond the Earth's atmosphere, this camera will handle the challenge with ease.  When I first purchased this camera, I had been mostly using a point and shoot (Kodak mostly and believe it or not had still been using an \"Instamatic\" quite a bit!) There is something to be said for having your photo slide out right away and blow on it until it is dry and done.As for this wonder of a camera, I especially love the ability to capture nature shots close up.  Believe it or not, by using something called a \"Zoom Lens\" you can get much closer to your subject without walking any closer yourself.  This \"Zoom\" works great for family fotos and action shots, as well.My only problem with this camera has to do with the way you hold it, and I honestly am hesitant to even mention it and ruin a perfect review.  Nonetheless, when holding this camera, the longer you hold it the heavier i begins to \"feel.\"  I am almost certain that the true weight does not change and that this is a \"mind trick\" but it is worth it to keep in mind that you should always rest between every 15 to 20 exposures in order to make sure every shot is getting your best effort.My recent assignment was taking pictures of protozoans under microscope lenses for a science magazine, and this was handled with ease.  While this camera is definitely not a microscope, it can be used in conjunction with one and will work in most advanced scientific endeavors.

I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.The camera has a wonderful feel, viewfinder and reasonably good controls. But the results are disappointing. The sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition (Canon) offers. Nikon finally realized this and on Dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1,200. It just so happened mine was in Melville, N.Y., with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty. These include bad AF performance since upgrading to V2 of the firmware, bad color, overexposure, blurry images with the VR lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value.I would strongly suggest that you don't buy this camera and thereby reward Nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers.
