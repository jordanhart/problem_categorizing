{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not the Holga I hoped for", "Author": "theanj", "ReviewID": "R1KDY3DXQFZAAC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera without being able to find any reviews.  The price was good, I love holga, diana, lomo and toy cameras, so what the heck.It is a cheap, plasticy cameara with a shutter so quiet, you can't hear it.  fixed focus lens, or you can adjust it for macro.  no appature adjustment.  I personally would have loved an appature adustment - remember the sun or the cloudy settings - no biggie, I do like the fixed focus.When you get your camera, be sure to have 3 new AAA batteries.  I does come with them, but they are cheap and probably near dead, I got 3 shots before mine were gone.  Also a SD card.  I put a 4GB, that's good for 800 shots at the fine (12mp) setting.The two biggest disapointments for me was  #1 a rectangular screen.  I really got into the square format of diana images with the vignetted edges.  You will get some vignetted sides with this camera, but without the square formant, a  big bummer for me.  Sure you can  crop, but loose the vignette -The other issue I had was #2 the lens is way too sharp.  Nothing like the Holga lenses, this lens was rather sharp without the abberations that make the Holga lenses unique.  Not as sharp as a DSLR Lens, maybe more like a cellphone.  Good, but not great, but not poor either.But the camera is fun and easy to use.  I don't get into the effects that are built in, you can add those later if you like wtih photoshop or lightroom.  I shot outside on a sunny day, and got nice contrasty images.  The shutter speed is rather slow, so have a steady hand, or enjoy the blur.  It's also nice you can turn the flash on or off.  The digital zoom is useless - you can crop later needed.So it is what it is.  Not a Lomo or Holga, but a fun toy camera to use and enjoy.  I'll keep mine and am looking forward to using it again.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun, Inexpesive, and Sometimes Frustrating But Worth It", "Author": "Thomas \"tomsde\"", "ReviewID": "RFKONPNEPDD4L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been facinated by the trend in photography called Lomography, which consists of using cheap plastic conventional cameras to produce images with visual defects, vignetting, and often unconventional color gamuts.  The images acquired by these cameras have a nostagic appeal, especially for people like myself whose first camera may very well have been a consumer level film camera. My first camera was a Kodak Brownie, which was a medium format camera which took square pictures.  Square prints were ubiquitous until point and shoot 35 mm cameras replaced Instamatics and Polaroids in the 80s when the 3 to 2 aspect ratio ruled.  So I considered buying a Diana film camera, but things like the availability and cost of film and processing quickly discouraged me.  So what next?  It was possible to creat a \"lomo\" look in  Photoshop and other image processing software, but that elliminated the fun and sponaiety of being able to go out and just shoot photos with crazy abandon and then pick out ones best shots later.  So what other options did I have?  Read on:I sought out a digital camera that produced a lomo look without having to mess with buying film and finding processing.  It's true that there are cell phone apps that can produce a similar look but I've not found one that I really like for the Android OS--those with iPhones have much better choices.  The first camera I found that fit the bill was the Digital Harinezumi--it did both video and still photos with a variety of \"retro\" effects but I found the camera difficult to use.  It was tiny, did not fit in my hand well, and had a difficult menu to manipulate to bring up different effects and functions which reset itself every time the camera was turned off.  So after rmuch frustration I sold that camera.Enter the Lomo JOCO VX5 which is considered to be a \"toy\" camera as the Digital Harizeumi was categorized to be and has the retro look of a film camera.  Billed as digital Holga, it is sort of a weird hybrid that produces lomo looking images at 4000 x 3000 resolution (3 to 2 35mm film aspect ratio)--with a variety of easy to access effects.  I agree with the other reviewer here that it would have been better if a square or 1:1 aspect ratio were available as the vignetting the camera produces can't be turned off so severe cropping would be necessary to get more of a true Holga or Diana look.  The color images it produces is similar to cross processing; others are a selection of tints.  There are variety of color effects that can be applied while taking the pictures and a menu of them with some other options that can only be applied after they have been taken accessed through the viewing menu.  The effects applied afterwards  retain a copy of the original color scheme that the picture was taken in.  I like the black and white setting the best, it produces better grayscale images than my much more expensive cameras in many cases The video produced is a vhs quality 4:3 aspect ratio with poor somewhat sound quality, which is more of a super 8 or 8mm look.  There is no speaker, so whatever audio is recorded can only be listened to or heard until images are downloaded ot a computer.  Focus is fixed and there is only a close up or 3 ft to infinity setting; the \"macro\" is not true macro and is somewhat limited.Pros:  Produces whimsical and interesting images.  The camera's price is resonable for a novelty camera.  Menus are straightforward and easy to access.  Resolution for still images is high enough to produce a decent quality print should you desire to do so.  There is an onboard flash as well which is a feature that is often absent in cameras in the toy camera class.  No film required for that cool lomo look.  The vignetting for the most part looks good, but it would have been nice to have the option to turn it off if desired.Cons:  The camera only can output 3:2 aspect ratio images, so if you are looking for a square prints you're out of luck here.  The camera also has a significant shutter lag and does poorly in low light situations.  Light areas can be easily blown out so it is necessary to often access the EV settting or exposure comensation to make adjustments as it is virtually impossible to recovery badly overexposed images.  The date and time settings are whiped out when the camera battery compartment is opened so I  use the included cables to transfer my images rather than removing the SD card so that I don't have to reset the date/time every time I use the camera.My final analysis is that it is a good camera for the money and in the class with more options than offered by most for novelty and experimentation.  I like it better than the Digital Harinezumi and reccomend it over that unit hands down.  Fun, inexpensive, sometimes fruistrating but worth it.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "toy camera", "Author": "PATRIZIA A.", "ReviewID": "R1RU7I1CWNSD5Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "did not expect much from this toy camera but the quality of the images is not good at all, wouldn't recommend it to anyone", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$139.95", "Features": null, "Name": "Lomo JOCO VX5 12MP Digital Holga Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ak7tYgUoL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00773A8NW"}}
