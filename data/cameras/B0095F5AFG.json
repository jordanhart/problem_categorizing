{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ever ask yourself what the offspring from a DSLR and point-and-shoot camera would be?", "Author": "Richard C. Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...", "ReviewID": "R1YIDYZ5KGN6YY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a camera nut. I use my 5D MKIII and 7D to make a living. I've also gone through a variety of compact cameras. I always carry a camera, and unless I'm specifically out on a shoot, I don't want to lug abound my big camera and lens. My camera of choice has been the Panasonic Lumix ZS20 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom (Black), and for the price it's still a great camera.  The Fujifilm XF1, although it has lower resolution, has now replaced it.  Two words: Sensor size.This uses a much larger sensor than your standard point and shoot - 2/3 of an inch. For a point and shoot/compact/pocket camera, it's unusual. True, more and more manufacturers are producing cameras with larger sensors, and eventually DSLR's (large cameras with mirrors) will be replaced by mirrorless models. For now, I love my DSLR and really, really like the XF1.  There are a lot of things to like. The larger sensor means that more light is captured and the pixel quality is superior. Result - better low light photos and crisper, better quality photos. A 12mp camera with this large sensor will produce images with better quality than even an 18mp camera with one of those teeny sensors.Example sensor sizes:Standard compact camera: 3.2 x 2.4 mm (7.68 mm surface area) and 4.8 x 3.6 mm (17.28 mm surface area)Panasonic Lumix ZS20 6.08 x 4.56 mm (27.724 mm surface area)Fujifilm XF1/: 8.8 x 6.6 mm (58.08 mm surface area)Canon 7D: 22.3 x 14.9 mm (332.27 mm surface area)OK, so I take this thing out of the box. It is very retro. My GF's comment - \"It looks so old that nobody will bother stealing it...\" The controls seem minimal, but there are more than you first realize. This is the first camera I have found that is impossible to turn on without step by step instructions. There's a decal on the camera explaining it (poorly.) There's a mini guide to turning it on. There are several pages in the manual. It's clever, but it's something Rube Goldberg could have dreamed up. Twist the lens. Pull the lens out. Twist it again. We have power!  Since the lens has a manual zoom (yes, a manual zoom), when you zoom out (go wider) you can accidentally turn the camera off. Bizarre. It's like the Nostromo self destruct mechanism on the original Alien movie.The external controls are varied - on top we have the popup flash (feels cheap), a function button (Fn - so small it's easy to miss), the shutter release and the selector dial. On the back are two dials, a rocker and four buttons.  This camera has so many features that several levels of menus are needed. This makes if difficult to find features. But - and this is rare on this type of camera - you have three custom function buttons. You can set the camera up the way you want, then save this configuration to a custom setting. Three different configurations. That's something some DSLR's don't even have.When it comes to my DSLR, I shoot manual. I'm happy to see that the camera has a full manual mode, in addition to the many other modes. The auto-focus is near instant, the image quality amazing. Granted I've only used it for a day (shot around 200 photos and did not kill the battery.) I'll have it in my pocked for a while and will use it almost every day - I'll update as I gain more experience with it. Features? Exposure bracketing. Flash bracketing. Panorama stitching and even more.After a day of using this camera I am impressed.  I did add a screen protector (I have a bunch on hand that can be cut to size) as the screen is plastic and I hate scratched screens. I also have a bunch of small camera bags on hand. Tried a few of them, finding that the Case Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Case with Storage (Black) fit perfectly.The camera stores photos in two formats: RAW and jpg. RAW is also called a \"digital negative\" - RAW format is RAF. Photoshop and Lightroom support it.  Jpg file, Fine: 1.3 to 2.2 meg each image. RAW format 19 to 21 meg (numbers vary depending on colors and detail.)RAW and JPG has an image resolution of 4000x3000 pixels. If you use some of the special \"pro\" effects (pin focus, etc.) the image size drops to 2816x1221 pixels. Panorama size is 11520x1080.Apart from the case you'll also need an SD card. A proprietary battery is included, as well as a charger, USB cable and wrist strap.OK, so who (whom?) is this camera for? The serious amateur would be happy. The pro looking for a more portable pocket camera would like it (but no interchangeable lenses). A beginner may be overwhelmed at first, but just use full auto and you're all set. It a camera that someone with limited (or no!) camera experience can use, then grow into as skills improve. It has all the features you'd ever want. A pro or serious amateur will be surprised at the feature set. You'll have several \"oh - it does that?!?\" moments.11-26-2012: Been toying with the video. I love high speed video. The XF1 shoots 70fps at 640x480, 120fps at 320x240 and 200fps at 320x112.Effects can be \"stacked\" (my term). For example, if you set the film type to B&W;, turn on bracketing and shoot - you'll get three B&W; shots.Battery - the battery drains when in the camera, even if the camera is off. The battery died in-camera. Put it away with 1/2 power. Two days later it was dead. So check and charge the battery before using! Have also been noticing more of the attention to quality - for example, the SD card slot. It's metal lined, not plastic. Plus - even if you try - you can't slide the SD card lock switch up. That's a GOOD thing. I have four other compact cameras. Another Fuji, a Panasonic, a Kodak and a Sony. You have to be cautious with all of them - slightly angled and the lock switch slides up, and your photos can't be saved. You need to remove the card, unlock, and replace.  There is also SOME internal memory. You can capture a few images, but not enough to replace even the smallest memory card.  But it's better than nothing if you forget to put in the memory card and discover this once you're away from home.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"Lens Control Error\" on 4 out of 4 cameras I got. 100% failure rate with identical symptoms, likely design flaw in lens.

from my experiences with these.During this past summer we bought not one, but four XF1s among the friends and family. I loved the Fuji. The EXR sensor was made famous by its X100 for great signal to noise ratio, low light capability, and saturated colors. It has incredible and accurate JPEG colors that requires little to no adjustment to look amazing. The lens is tack sharp. The zoom lens starts at a very good 25mm wide range with a big f1.8 aperture. Add optical image stabilizer and a low noise sensor, it's a champ at low lights. There is full manual control with RAW. The video looks great at 1080p. The menus and controls are well thought out. Focus is fast and accurate. The build quality was excellent, felt solid in the hand, and it looked great (in my opinion). This was a camera that performed like much larger bodies with larger sensors, at a fraction of the size and cost.The twist lens is a bit of a nuisance and requires both hands for operation, while not really booting any faster than if it had a power button (it still takes a second or so to turn on after the lens extends). I didn't understand the design decision, other than perhaps by doing so it results in a quieter operation without motor noise, and possibly better reliability as well.The lens, alas, became the fatal problem, which I'll describe in more detail later. During the summer we shot thousands of pictures, and the camera failed within 6 weeks, right outside the return period. Granted, I shoot a lot more than the average user, but there was no explanation for this. I thought maybe we did something that caused this failure, but in reality we babied the camera without ever abusing it.However, in time, ALL of the other three cameras developed the same problem. I purchased these in July, and the last one developed this problem at the beginning of November--the one that's probably the least used. This denotes that the problem isn't isolated, but results from a design flaw, that in my four cameras, caused a 100% failure rate.The problem, which eventually renders the camera inoperable, comes in stages. The process is identical for all four of the XF1 cameras, occurring at zoom range after 35mm. It approximately develops as follows:- After a good number of shots (it varies a bit on this one, from 1000-5000 frames, probably depending on how often the lens was turned or how it was assembled?), you start noticing some strange blurs around the edges, particularly for telephoto end of the lens. It's easy to put it off as a lens quality issue.- Then, you'll notice that exposure goes haywire around the telephoto end. It would either grossly overexpose or underexpose, and using compensation or manual override wouldn't do anything. Sometimes it would appear as if the sensor is screwed up, giving garbled images while metering/focusing. Restarting the camera would fix it, until you try to take shots at the tele end again. (at least two other reviewers mentioned this early stage problem)- Soon after, when you zoom over 35mm, and physically move the camera, you will get \"Lens Control Error\" which requires a reset. On one of the slower progressing cameras, this developed into a full fledge problem where anything after 35mm will give a shaky image on the viewfinder, like the optics have come loose (or I think something went wrong with the image stabilizer)., and you will easily get \"lens control error\" with any sudden physical movement. For the other three XF1s, it's more of a abrupt degeneration to the point where the \"lens control error\" will occur every time you zoom past 35mm, with a noticeable shift in image on the LCD (as if optics suddenly tilted/shifted).- My friend who kept on using his at 25mm range, thinking he could make do with it as long as it's not zoomed in. However, it eventually worsened that it'll give \"lens control error\" at 25mm too, rendering the camera completely unusable at shooting photos. (video included)The 100% failure rate, the speed at which it failed, as well as the identical progressions and symptoms suggest that this is a highly repeatable and non-random issue. There is clearly a design flaw. My family has gone out of the country with two of the cameras, with no warranty service available to them. My friend and I are stuck with ours, and will take up Fuji's warranty service in the coming days. The dilemma for us is whether if we even want this replaced with the same camera, knowing the same design flaw persists; That's unless Fuji had figured this out with a good fix, something I have found no evidence of so far. It seems like a near certain loss that's difficult to recover; and it's a shame since the camera was such a great performer and so portable.While the price of XF1 has come down due to its end-of-life status, I would still advise against the purchase of this camera. As of right now we're looking to probably get either a flawed replacement, or a \"repaired\" camera that's only 3 months old. Neither is ideal, and you can avoid my predicament by getting something else, possibly XF1's latest successor, the Fuji XQ1 or other capable pocket cameras. I hope this helps.___________________________________11/20/2013 update:Here is the latest update. I just got off the phone with the Fuji Pro Repairs (1-800-800-3854 Option #1 and then Option #2. That's the only way to reach them since all my emails got a terse reply making me call this number). They weren't particularly helpful, to say the least, and were pretty dismissive about the problems I experienced. They were fighting to talk over me, stressing again and again how they have never heard of this problem, how they never see this online and in their own service bulletin, and how they have worked there for a long time to know better, etc. Frustrated, I asked to speak to the call center manager, who were no better for it--same dismissive attitude, and almost identical \"the cameras are great because we've never heard of this problem in the X years I've worked here\" rhetoric. (Perusing Amazon reviews, I could see lens control error just a few reviews earlier than mine. He probably thought it's isolated like myself. I did until my other 3 broke).I personally think there hasn't been as many complaints surfacing on their bulletin (if true) because XF1 is evidently a low volume seller, judging from the sometimes low clearance prices required to move them since summer. There's also plenty of mentions to this problem around the web when you Google \"xf1 lens error\". That notion was likewise vehemently dismissed by Fuji's reps, again stressing that they have never seen or heard of it, in their bulletins or on the web. They suggested that it could very well be a firmware problem (when it's obviously physical with the optical wobbling and shifting of preview image.) I was treated like this crazy idiot who just didn't know what I was talking about.I inquired the possibility of replacing my broken XF1 with a different camera, since I was convinced that XF1 is flawed. I got slightly different replies. The first rep said that depending on their tech department's determination, they may replace it with \"at least an XF1\", which lead to the possibility of something different/better. I asked to speak to the manager because the rep said only the manager could decide. However, the manager said there's \"zero possibility\" that it would be replaced with anything other than XF1, at best. As you might imagine, both the rep and the manager made it clear that they would be doing me a favor by replacing it with another XF1, which they stubbornly believe is a bulletproof pro camera that only insane people would find otherwise. They said that the only thing I could do is to send it in and have them look at it, then they'll decide whether to repair or replace. I would have to write a letter, explaining the problem in detail, put in any sales receipt or what not, and they'll determine what to do.Everything I just spoke on the phone--as difficult as it was to explain to deaf ears--would not go on record apparently, until I send in the camera and a letter (maybe that's part of the reason why they have no record of the problem in their service bulletins?). No RMA case was created (they couldn''t). No shipping label would be provided--I'd have to ship with a trackable service at my own cost. They'll just contact me when they receive it, if I put my contact info on the letter. When I suggested that the lack of at least a RMA seems unstructured and unsafe, I got another rant on how they've been doing this for 35 years with no problems.So this call accomplished little, other than finding an unwillingness by Fuji to acknowledge this as a flawed design, and their complete lack of awareness to this problem. I'm not feeling terribly optimistic with the warranty service now--quite the contrary. Yet seeing how the broken camera is completely useless in my hands anyway, I will ship mine back to them just to see what happens.The address to send the camera to for repairs:Fujifilm Camera Repairs1100 King George Rd.Edison, NJ 08837I encourage those who may have the same problem as mine to bring it to Fuji's attention. This certainly shouldn't have been a non-issue. I will report back when I have updates.___________________________________12/2/2013Just got off the phone with Fujifilm service center in Edison, NJ again.

Since it's apparently an automatically generated message, I thought maybe repair can equal to replacement. At any rate, there's a confusing bit about how I need to respond to them in 2 weeks, so I used the website link to check up the repair status, and I got the following:-------------Begin estimate insert-----------Order StatusWAITING FOR ESTIMATE APPROVALEstimate Charge ($)140Shipping Charge ($)18Tax ($)11.66Total Charges ($)169.66---------End estimate insert -----------------It looks like they are waiting for my approval of $169.66 to have the camera repaired! I called up the number provided in the email (which didn't really lead directly to the repair center. I needed to navigate 3 levels of menus, option 1, 2, 4 I believe for pro repairs), asking about why I was charged this amount when it should have been under warranty.The service rep looked up the info and said that they found a ding on the front of the lens housing, suggesting impact damage, resulting in the lens error, and the warranty was voided. I tried to explain how the front lens housing has a very thin sheet metal, and can easily be dinged (e.g. putting it in the pocket with other things?), and how I have three others in pristine condition with the same problem, proving its irrelevance. I sent this  camera (my friend's) in because it's got the most advanced development of this error, where it shows up without having to zoom.The representative wasn't belligerent and defensive like last time, but he went on to say that's how the tech reported it and he couldn't do anything about it. He suggested to transfer me to the manager, so I could speak to him. I had him do that, but after a few minutes the same rep returned, saying how the manager was able to lower the bill to $100. I said that's not going to cut it (this really isn't about the money), and I needed to speak to him (even though it really didn't seem like we'll get anywhere), so he transferred me.After a minute, a brusque and rushed voice came on and said \"hello\", and I responded a few times; but he apparently had a problem hearing me (not sure why), and he hung up on me. I had to call again, immediately, navigating through the menu and holds, asking again to speak to the manager, Dan Scarola. This time it went straight to his voicemail, saying that he's out for the day. I left a message, again explaining the situation, and left my number, asking for a call back.So, that's the latest update. Needless to say, I'm more than disappointed. I'll try to reach him tomorrow, and if that doesn't get anywhere (a rather likely event), I'll be forced to cancel the estimate and get the broken camera back--it doesn't make sense to pay $100-$169.66 for a half-measure repair on a 199 camera (it also seems strange that the rather exorbitant estimated cost can be so arbitrarily adjusted). I don't even think it's worth the $7 FedEx shipping I paid for sending it in (not sure why Fuji's charging $18), if they are only going to do a repair without acknowledging the evident and a repeatable engineering flaw. Not only will I end up with repaired/refurbished cameras, they will most likely develop the same errors again.The inclination to downplay camera problems and voiding warranty really brought down my expectations to nothing, and my initial \"wait and see\" sentiment became that of an outrage. I have had a great opinion on Fuji's recent cameras, and I recommend them heartily to family and friends (hence the 4 XF1s). Yet this good feeling has gone negative through the recent dealings with Fujifilm. I actually have other new Fujifilm X series cameras, and now not only am I leery about my future support, but that I just don't want to deal with Fujifilm anymore.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "If Hedy Lamarr were a camera, she would be a Fujifilm XF1", "Author": "Noemata", "ReviewID": "R33Q00NV6QHQ3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Hedy Lamarr was a world class mathematician who, among other accomplishments, invented and patented frequency-hopping spread-spectrum transmission of radio signals -- a fundamental building block of modern avionics and cell phone technology; she was also an aviatrix whose skills rivaled those of Amelia Earhart.  However, BECAUSE Hedy Lamarr was a major Hollywood movie star and pin-up model, her substantial intellectual accomplishments often are overlooked or lightly dismissed.)Do not allow the pretty face of the very petit faux leather clad Fujifilm XF1, and its (seeming) paucity of knobs and dials and levers, to deceive you.  The XF1 is a technologically advanced high-end instrument with provision for fully manual adjustments of shutter speed and aperture, of zoom, manual-by-wire focus adjustment, RAW recording capability, etc. (all at the user's option, of course).  AND the XF1 has a simply superb fast lens that illuminates a photo sensor that is quite large for a camera that is in its class or close to its external dimensions.  (But you did notice, didn't you, that the XF1 is stylish and will fit in a pocket or purse?)First and foremost, the Fujifilm XF1 is an EXR technology camera.  That means that it gives the best results at \"half resolution.\"  The Fujifilm XF1, which has a sensor with twelve million photosites, is marketed as a twelve megapixel (12 MP) camera because many consumers mistakenly believe that there is a direct relationship between the pixel count and quality/performance, and consequently demand high pixel counts, and because Fujifilm wants to sell cameras, its mentions of megapixels in its advertising of the XF1 states the MAXIMUM megapixel resolution image that the camera can deliver instead of the megapixel resolution of the BEST QUALITY image that the camera can deliver.  The Fujifilm XF1 IS CAPABLE of taking pictures at 4000x3000 (12 MP) resolution; you CAN use it that way simply by setting the image size to \"Large.\"  But (as users of other Fujifilm EXR cameras already know) shooting an EXR camera in just the same way that you would shoot a competing compact camera is a bit like using a Ferrari sports car to haul a heavy trailer; you will not be taking advantage of the Ferrari's special strengths in accelerating and braking and handling, and you will be disappointed by its inferior trailer-hauling capability.  Where the XF1 REALLY shines is when it is set to take  advantage of EXR by exposing pictures at \"Medium\" size (2816x2112 pixels, or 6 MP resolution), still using ALL twelve million photosites, but using six million of them to ENHANCE the \"first\" six million:  making the XF1 one of the best 6 MP cameras the world has yet known ... because of its exceptional ability to capture wide dynamic range.\"Dynamic range\" is what allows a camera to record both very bright areas and very deep shadows in the same scene without the bright areas fading to featureless white or the shadows either blocking up as featureless black or appearing very grainy from electronic noise.  Small, pocketable, cameras must have small sensor chips inside, and -- to be blunt -- small sensors, generally, are deficient in ability to capture wide dynamic range.  The main reason why so many photos taken with camera phones are unsatisfying is that camera phones have very limited dynamic range.EXR cameras are the exception to the general rule that small sensors cannot deliver dynamic range.  A full explanation of Fujifilm's unique EXR technology, the first fruits of which hit the market at the beginning of 2009, is beyond the scope of this review.  However, DPReview.com, which is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, and is Amazon.com's sister site, has provided detailed and illustrative technical explanations in two or more articles.  Amazon's software that automatically removes all links to any site other than Amazon.com prohibits my providing links to the DPReview.com articles within this review; but if you visit DPReview, seek out editor Richard Butler's April 2009 review of the Fujifilm F200EXR camera (the first commercial product to offer EXR), and the July 11, 2012, review written by editors Amadou Diallo and Barney Britton of the Fujifilm X10; the technical explanations commence, respectively, at page 2 of the F200EXR review and at page 9 of the X10 full review. The more recent (and fuller) review of the Fujifilm X10 camera is perhaps more poignant, because the X10 shares its 2/3\" sensor with the XF1, which has an \"EXR-II Processor\" CPU upgrade from the \"EXR Processor\" CPU of the X10; the XF1 also has later firmware to go with the upgraded processor.  And if on DPReview.com you look up the December 2013 review of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1, a camera with a sensor roughly four times the size of the sensor on the XF1, in the first (\"Cameras Compared\") chart substitute the Fujifilm X10 camera (which is the only EXR camera that you can choose) set to \"EXR DR 400\" for the Fujifilm X-M1 camera, you will see that the Fujifilm X10 thrashes all of the other cameras at ANY of their DR settings in the breadth of its dynamic range; the Fujifilm XF1 would show identical results to those of the Fujifilm X10.When a Fujifilm EXR camera is set to EXR mode (on the mode dial atop the camera) with \"DR priority,\" OR is set to P (program) mode at M (medium) size and set to \"DR400\" dynamic range, the EXR sensor exposes immediately adjacent pixels at two different durations (the equivalent of shutter speeds), then processes the pixels in tandem, integrating the different readings, to give the resulting image the shadow depth of the longer exposure and the highlight depth of the shorter exposure, yielding images with a dynamic range that is -- BY FAR -- superior to the dynamic range that the XF1's peers among compact cameras yield.  But to get that dynamic range the XF1 needs to process the photosites in pairs; so, instead of an image of 4000x3000 pixels, you get an image that is a little more than seven-tenths as wide and seven-tenths as tall:  2816x2112 pixels.  The resulting 6 MP EXR-processed photo is a deeper, richer image than the 12 MP image that the same XF1 would take when set to Large size (which disables the EXR processing).But don't you \"need\" more than six million pixels; aren't more pixels \"better\"?  You may be surprised:  the famed \"Retina\" display on the largest of the new Apple Macbook Pro computers is 2880x1800 pixels; if you could translate the pixels of a 6 MP Fujifilm XF1 photo to the Macbook Pro screen pixel-for-pixel, the photo would use all but 32 pixels (about 1/7 of an inch) on each side of the width of the screen, and the image would run 156 pixels (a bit more than 2/3 of  an inch) above the top and 156 pixels below the bottom of the screen.  In other words, you could not fit more resolution onto the big Mac Retina screen than what a 6 MP image supplies.  On a more conventional high definition 1600x1200 resolution monitor, or a 1920x1080 resolution HDTV, the entire screen could show only about a third of the pixels of the Fujifilm XF1 M size photo at one time, and you would need to use sliders to pan the photo on the screen.  If you are having color prints made from a 6 MP digital image, the processing will literally have to throw away a portion of the pixels for any print size up to 8\" x 10\" or (depending on the print machine) even 11\" x 14\" prints.  If instead you are having an 8\" x 10\" print made from a 12 MP digital file, all of the \"extra megapixels\" (compared to the 6 MP file) are simply wasted, and are sent to the discarded bit trash heap.  (For a 16\" x 20\" or larger size print, you do have a chance to get an improved print with more than 6 MP, but are you really looking to make easel-sized prints from a camera that you can put in your pocket?)The Fujifilm XF1 is not only \"an\" EXR camera; it is an evolved, latest generation, EXR camera.  The XF1's 2/3\" sensor is the largest Fujifilm EXR sensor yet (the Fujifilm X10 and X-S1, both EXR cameras, also incorporate a 2/3\" sensor); and it is quite a bit larger -- 34 percent greater surface area -- than the 1/1.7\" sensors that are found in competitors like the Canon G15 or Panasonic LX7.  The sensors of the \"early\" 2009 Fujifilm EXR cameras comprised charged-coupled devices (CCD) to capture the image; as late as 2011, the excellent Fujifilm X10 camera deployed a front-illuminated CMOS sensor in place of the CCD sensor in order to gain faster response; now the XF1 ups the light-gathering ante further, by incorporating a backside illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor. BSI CMOS provides a greater light-gathering surface than front-illuminated CMOS for any given sensor size.  A result is that the XF1 has the fastest focusing speed of any contrast detection autofocus compact Fujifilm camera to date, and at higher ISO settings the XFI images exhibit very low noise for such a compact camera.The 4x zoom (technically, varifocal) LENS of the XF1 (equivalent to a 25 mm to 100 mm zoom in 135 full frame format) incorporates more advanced technology than any other non-interchangeable zoom lens that Fujifilm has fitted to any consumer camera to date.  (That statement will be regarded as heresy by owners of the Fujifilm X10 and X20 cameras, but it is true.)  The XF1's lens has seven elements (all of them glass) in six groups, an unusually low count for a 4x zoom lens with a bright maximum aperture (at the wide end) of f/1.8.  All other things being equal, the lower the element count, the better, because every air/glass and glass/glass interface within a lens is an occasion for reflections, reducing light transmission, and, in the bounces back and forth, introducing veiling flare.  An amazing statistic:  The Fujifilm XF1 lens has no fewer than four aspherical elements (more than half of its seven elements) and three elements of extra low dispersion (ED) glass; compare the 4x zoom lens fitted to the XF1's sisters, the Fujifilm X10 and X20, a lens that deservedly has garnered fulsome praise from many discerning critics: that lens features eleven elements in nine groups, among which are three aspherical elements (one fewer than the XF1's lens has) and two ED glass elements (one less than the XF1's lens has).  You will not find ANY other lens of ANY camera manufacturer that has a higher proportion of aspherical and ED elements than the lens of the XF1.  **Edit October 7:  The just-announced Zeiss Otus manual focus 55 mm f/1.4 prime lens for full-frame Nikon and Canon 35mm DSLRs will have twelve elements in ten groups, and six of those elements will be \"anomalous partial dispersion\" glass elements (one element is aspherical); the recommended retail price for the Zeiss Otus 55/1.4 lens will be 2,940 euros (plus VAT) or US$3,999.The technique of applying a coating to the surface of a lens to decrease reflections at the glass/air interface and thus to increase the transmittance of light through the lens, has been around since the 1930s, but until the early 1960s, the method to apply the coating was vapor deposition (think of the water condensing on the outside of a glass of ice water on a humid day).  When Fujifilm's predecessor corporation was awarded the contract to supply the broadcast lenses for the television cameras in the venues of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Fujifilm -- which, as a manufacturer of photographic film, had long experience in applying coatings to substrates -- developed (and patented) a completely new process, electron beam coating, or EBC, to apply antireflective coatings to the individual lens elements.  The EBC process (which \"paints\" on a coating in the manner of the beam that \"paints\" an image on a cathode ray television tube) allows a thinner layer of coating to be applied, and allows application of some coating materials that are not susceptible to be applied by vapor deposition.  Although the 1960s patents have expired, Fujifilm still protects its EBC trade secrets, and for five decades has remained the world leader in lens coating technology.  The lenses of other high-end Fujifilm fixed-lens cameras, including the more expensive X100S, X20, and X10, feature a \"Super EBC\" evolution of the EBC coatings that incorporates improvements to EBC that Fujifilm has made over those five decades.  But recently Fujifilm has made a further quantum improvement to the EBC process, which it calls \"High Transmittance EBC\" (acronym:  HT-EBC), which Fujifilm heretofore has used only on its broadcast lenses and on some of the very expensive XF series interchangeable lenses for its high-end X-Pro1 cameras, such as the $700 Fujifilm XF 18-55mm F2.8-4.0 Lens Zoom Lens.  You can read about HT-EBC on the Fujifilm Global website under \"XF Lens - Lens Technology.\"  The XF1 is the first (and, so far, the ONLY) fixed lens Fujifilm camera to have the HT-EBC coatings applied to its lens surfaces; all 14 surfaces of the XF1's seven lens elements have individual HT-EBC coatings.  Compared to the XF1's lens, lesser lenses from other camera makers have only selected surfaces coated, and often those coatings have been applied using the inferior vapor deposition process.The proof that all of this advanced (and expensive) technology -- aspherical elements, ED elements, and HT-EBC -- works is in the doing:  the lens of the XF1 produces stunningly sharp results with minimal flare.  The image quality is -- in one word -- superb.  As the 1960s Konica commercials used to say, \"the lens alone is worth the price\" of the camera.Fujifilm has continued to refine its \"jpeg engine,\" the software that converts the information received at the sensor into an image file with a .jpg suffix; the XF1's jpeg engine may be the current champion in objective and subjective color rendition among all camera makers worldwide.  The company's decades of experience in making color film has given it a deep. deep corporate knowledge base in color rendition that other companies continue to discover requires years -- decades -- to develop.  The XF1 gives the user several ways to take advantage of that Fujifilm expertise, even allowing a user of the XF1 to choose whether he or she wants to shoot with the color curve and rendition of Provia (the most versatile of the Fujifilm color films), or Astia, the Fujifilm color film the flattering tonal renditions of which is favored by portrait photographers and wedding photographers, or Velvia, the punchy color of Fujifilm's bright color slide film.  The photographer with a Fujifilm XF1 in his or her hands can make that choice on every shot -- or he or she can have the camera \"bracket\" shots, taking three exposures in quick succession, each with a different film simulation color curve.Unusually for a camera of its physical size, the Fujifilm XF1 also can produce RAW files for advanced post-processing, and can do so either in RAW-only shooting mode or making RAW+JPG pairs of each exposure.  A RAW file contains all of the information from the sensor, plus information about the camera's settings.  In the XF1 (except in some exceptional circumstances when the camera is set for Medium size, RAW+JPG is selected, and certain ISO settings are active), the RAW files are very large, nearly 20 MB each; but access to a RAW version of the exposure allows the user to apply his or her own color curves and other settings in developing a final .jpg file.  The Fujifilm XF1 contains in firmware a RAW converter -- to make a smaller .jpg file from the RAW file -- in fact to enable making several .jpg files, each different -- without altering the RAW file, and Fujifilm supplies on a CD right in the XF1 box (also downloadable on-line) a copy of \"RAW File Converter EX powered by SilkyPix\" (both Windows and Mac versions), which is a specialized version of the commercial SilkyPix RAW converter that is available for other digital cameras.  The supplied Silkypix software has a complex and nonintuitive user interface, and its documentation is poor, but it has strong capabilities for the few who are willing to struggle through the very steep learning curve.  Other major vendors of RAW conversion software (Adobe, CaptureOne, Iridient) produce RAW converters for Fujifilm's format, but their EXR-specific products have lagged a generation behind updates of the RAW converters that the same vendors make for Canon and Sony and Pentax and Nikon; and, as of this writing, Apple's Aperture3 pro photo program still does not support the RAW format of Fujifilm's EXR technology cameras at all.  So most XF1 users will probably want to employ (and enjoy) the XF1's excellent jpeg engine -- or use the in-camera firmware RAW converter -- until the software writers catch up with a more attractive option.Two special features of the XF1 deserve further comment:  As far back as the Fujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD of 2009, which we have been using for four years, Fujifilm introduced a \"Pro Low Light\" mode to allow photos to be taken in dim ambient light without the noise of high ISO or the various problems of a flash.  Pro Low Light shoots a scene that otherwise would require, for example, at ISO 200, a 1/15 second shutter speed, by shooting in rapid succession four higher ISO exposures at one quarter (in this example, 1/60 second) the shutter duration; then, by combining the four exposures into a single image in the camera, the inherent digital noise of the higher ISO is averaged out and the result is remarkably like a 1/60 second exposure at ISO 200.  The technique works very well for a very steady (preferably tripod-mounted) camera and a still subject, but not so well if the photographer has shaky hands or if a breeze rustles the leaves in the shot.  Pro Low Light still exists in the XF1, aided greatly by the faster response of the BSI CMOS, so the steadiness of the photographer's grip is now less of an issue.  But -- under another name -- the technique has cropped up in another place in the XF1 as a feature called \"Advanced Anti-Blur,\" available in EXR Auto mode only.  Combined with the excellent lens shift optical image stabilization of the XF1, Advanced Anti-Blur shoots several very short duration shutter speed exposures in very rapid succession, then combines them in-camera into a single image that -- while not stopping action -- goes an extra step toward making low-light photography of subjects in motion better defined.  It is a worthwhile feature.The majority of the negative comments about the XF1, here on Amazon and elsewhere, are about the Fujifilm XF1's zoom ring on/off switch.  Frankly, most of the ire directed at the zoom ring on/off switch sounds to me like the comments of a man who has driven manual transmission vehicles all his life but now -- driving for the first time a car with an automatic transmission -- he complains that every time that (out of habit) he slams his foot down where the car's clutch pedal -should- be, the brakes screech the car to a stop.  \"I have this ingrained habit, so this, which contravenes my habit, is WRONG.\"TO THE CONTRARY, that feature happens to be the the one that, more than all others, positively influenced my own decision to purchase an XF1; the zoom ring on/off control of the Fujifilm XF1 IS different, but it is BETTER; it cuts seconds off the time needed to get ready to shoot, and it can make you a better photographer.Most compact cameras with zoom lenses default to the widest angle of the zoom when the camera is turned on.  If you like super wide angle photographs, where faces feature big noses and tiny ears because of perspective distortion and the subjects that you are shooting get lost in the clutter of far too much distracting detritus to the right and detritus to the left and detritus above and detritus below, then a camera's default to wide-wide angle is fine for you; but if you plan to shoot only at the widest setting, then your perfect camera does not need a zoom lens at all -- in fact, your perfect camera probably is an iPhone or an iPad.But if you want ever to shoot those \"other\" compact cameras at a focal length other than wide-wide, you are going to have to use a control, typically a tiny spring-loaded lever, to zoom the lens with an electric motor.  Almost invariably, however, motor-driven zoom from wide to tele is not continuous.  Although a zoom lens may have an overall range from 25 mm equivalent to 100 mm equivalent, only a few of the intermediate focal lengths between 25 and 100 can be set.  There will be a half dozen or so discreet steps (individual focal lengths) where the electronics can set the zoom, and possibly none of those steps will give you the framing you really want.  Also, when you push the fiddly lever for the zoom, if the camera has a wide zoom range, chances are that you will overshoot:  instead of going from 25 mm equivalent to something in the 80 mm range for a good head and shoulders portrait, suddenly you are all the way at maximum zoom and the viewing screen is filled with only a portion of the subject's face.  You try to adjust back downward, and now your zoom overshoots again to give you a top-of-the-head to knees view of your subject who by now has tired of waiting for you to set your hardware and has started a conversation with someone else.As noted above, we have been using a Fujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD for four years; we have run off about 6,000 shots with it; and we have been there, done that.  Attempting to set the 70EXR's 10x zoom (27 mm equivalent to 270 mm equivalent) to an equivalent focal length of 80 mm, even after four years of practice, is an exercise in frustration, typically requiring at least two to three seconds, often much more, jiggling back and forth, and by then, all too often, the moment is gone, sometimes gone forever.The zoom lens of the Fujifilm XF1 is, first, continuous, and, second, manually controlled.  You can set it anywhere from 25 mm equivalent to 100 mm equivalent, just as precisely as you want.  The choice of magnification and framing is yours; you can magnify the portion of the scene that you want to feature just right while cropping some ugly distraction out of the frame altogether.  It is very hard to do that with a stepped, motor-controlled zoom lens.With a little photographic experience, you get to know just about where you want the zoom to be before you have the camera out of its pouch.  On the Fujifilm XF1, I can be thinking \"about 70 mm equivalent\" even as I am putting my fingers around the large and unfussy zoom ring that also serves as the camera's on switch, and then I zoom to that point (the equivalent focal lengths are clearly marked right on the zoom ring) in the very process of turning on the camera.  As I frame the subject, I may come back a bit to 65 mm or zoom out a little further to 80 mm, but -- starting from the 70 mm setting -- it is EASY and completely unfussy to do so with the Fujifilm XF1.  I have experienced first hand electronically controlled zoom with twitch levers and stepped choices, and I can testify from first hand experience that the way that zooming a lens on a compact camera SHOULD be accomplished is the way it is done on the Fujifilm XF1.A peripheral comment on the SDHC cards that are most compatible with the Fujifilm XF1:  some of the features of the XF1, including RAW and RAW+JPG formats, video (movies), and stitched panoramas, write very large files to the memory card.  For those tasks, you need a -fast- card:  Class 10 or -- better -- UHS-I.  We have used the XF1 with two different Class 10 SDHC cards, and the subjective speed difference between an \"only\" Class 10 and a Class 10 UHS-I card is night and day.  The Sony SF8NX/TQM 8GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card is a good, competent, Class 10 \"only\" card, perfectly adequate for taking JPEG still photos; but, compared to the Lexar Professional 400x 8GB SDHC UHS-I Flash Memory Card LSD8GBCTBNA400, the Sony is left behind at the starting gate.  If you are going to get a camera as good as the XF1 and use the features of the camera that write large files, treat yourself to the faster performance of a Lexar Professional 400x SDHC UHS-I memory card; or, better, two:  Lexar Professional 400x 8GB SDHC UHS-I Flash Memory Card 2-Pack LSD8GBCTBNA4002 -- it is always good to carry a spare.Is there anything that I do not like about the XF1?  Sure:  * Fujifilm has polarized the LCD screen; that means that if (as I do) you wear polarized sunglasses, you cannot see the screen at all in Portrait orientation with your sunglasses on; either you have to take your sunglasses off, or shoot exclusively in Landscape orientation.  * The video (movie) button is not sufficiently protected; it is too easy to start shooting video when you do not want to.  * When you are shooting close-ups in Macro mode and shut the camera down, when you turn the camera back on, it is still on Macro mode:  that is not good if you have turned the camera back on to shoot a distant scenic.  (Macro mode can be \"locked\" -- either in or out -- with a l-o-n-g hold-down of the EFn button; but then it becomes a big deal to unlock it when you need to activate or to deactivate Macro again.)  * The procedure to switch from JPEG only shooting to RAW+JPEG or RAW only -- and back -- is buried too far down the menu tree. (Fortunately, it can be programmed to the Fn button, but that precludes you from assigning another function to that button.)  * For all of the XF1's sleek minimalist styling, the XF1 has a prominent control wheel (Fujifilm calls it the \"Main-command dial\") that cannot be programmed by the user and which Fujifilm has grossly under-utilized:  all the control wheel is used for is to adjust shutter speed when the mode dial is set to S, or to adjust aperture when the mode dial is set to A, or to perform \"program shift\" when both the mode dial is set to P and ISO is NOT set to an Auto setting.  That is an inexplicable waste of what could have been an ergonomically useful control.But these are minor criticisms, greatly outweighed by all that is good about this little gem.  You will not regret getting a Fujifilm XF1.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "JPG's like an absolute BOSS.", "Author": "Jeff Kraus", "ReviewID": "R3CK5A3UVNJWLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While researching this camera I saw a number of comments regarding the likelihood that Fuji had sacrificed substance for style in this model (some people had immediately dismissed it as being too 'fashionable' to be any good), which frankly I find to be ridiculous because there's no rule that the two are mutually exclusive.  Sure, I could do without the retro look if it came down to it, but overall I like the way it looks -- and I'm content with a retro-looking camera that takes great pictures while other people are applying the retro fad to the photos themselves, ruining everything they do with fake aged filters.Anyway, to the camera.  Included in the box with the camera is a wrist strap, battery, a charger with removable prongs (allowing you to just purchase different prongs rather than an entire charger if you go overseas, I guess), a USB cable, and a manual. On the camera are several reminders that you need to twist the lens barrel to turn it on.That's another love-it-or-hate-it point apparently.  I'm fine with it.  The first dozen times I tried to turn it on I would try to turn it the wrong way initially. My excuse being that Canon lenses (Canon being my preferred DSLR manufacturer) zoom from wide end to tele in the clockwise direction, while this lens twists counter-clockwise from off to standby to wide to tele.  However, once I got accustomed to it, I no longer had a problem.  Not being much of a video user, the manual zoom is not an issue for me -- but if you like to zoom during your videos you might end up with some noise from the rotation of the lens barrel. As a still photographer, I love the stepless manual control.The EXR sensor in the XF1 is designed with low-light image quality and dynamic range in mind, possibly at the expense of a minute amount of image detail in full resolution mode, but not enough that it should get in the way (or even be noticeable 99% of the time).  On the plus side, Fuji puts the EXR photosite configuration into use in two major ways: first, by reducing the size of the image to 6MP, the sensor can act as two interleaved sensors simultaneously recording the same image at different exposures, when are then merged in-camera for improved dynamic range.  Alternatively, (also at 6MP or 3MP) two or more adjacent photosites can be used instead of one to provide increased detail at high ISOs.  If you're interested, there is some information on the EXR sensor's configuration on Wikipedia if you search for 'Bayer sensor' (the standard configuration for most cameras) and scroll down to EXR.As far as features go, this little camera is packed with them.  It's so packed with features that it's a little mind boggling.  Many of them are only available in specific circumstances so you'll be looking for it and it won't be there - or it'll be grayed out - and you'll drive yourself crazy trying to get access to it again.  Admittedly, most of these features I will never use.  With the possible exception of panoramic mode, many of the features are the type of things that I might do in processing, but not in-camera.  One example would be the \"Pro Focus\" mode that another reviewer has mentioned.  It does a pretty decent job of isolating the subject with blur, but it's not a GREAT job.  I could spend a little time in Photoshop and probably come up with a much better result.I'll probably also never use the selective color modes, the 'facial recognition' mode (where you can have it try to determine who you know in the photo), the various unnecessary filter modes, 3D photo mode, or multiple exposure mode. So the real question for me would be, is it still a worthwhile camera if you ignore all of the fiddly stuff that you'll never use?It is.-- It's solidly built with an aluminum frame that feels really nice in your hands.-- Nice fast maximum aperture of f/1.8 (at 25mm), surprisingly good sharpness wide open for such a small lens.-- It's small enough for any pocket, unlike my Powershot G12.-- The manual zoom allows you to be as fast as you need to be at zooming to get your shot (rather than pressing on a rocker switch and waiting up to 3 seconds for the lens to finish zooming).-- After a few minutes the manual controls for aperture, shutter speed, etc. become almost second nature.-- The camera has a decent RAW mode and truly excellent JPG processing, so good in fact that I've considered ditching RAW mode on this camera entirely. That's really saying something, because I'm a HUGE proponent of RAW format (then again, I won't be using this camera in any circumstance where the 5D Mk II will be better suited, so RAW may not be needed).-- Extended dynamic range functionality is available in RAW mode.-- Customizable buttons allow you to program your most often-used features for easier access.-- Surprisingly excellent behavior in low light, with less grain in the final image than I would have expected.-- Quick response times, for the most part (see below)-- An electronic on-screen level.-- Flash stays out of the way until you specifically want it.  I like that.-- However it determines which level of DR to apply, it does a pretty good job with it.*- Flash metering performance is great, especially for photos of people.  I never see blown out faces, and color is reasonably accurate, if a bit oversaturated.*- The reduction to 6MP when shooting in the EXR modes is generally worth it. Specifically, the \"High ISO, Low Noise\" mode is quite effective at around ISO 1600-3200. Remember, 6MP is still enough for an 8x10 print, and more than enough for any online viewing.It's not all awesome though.  Some down sides:-- There is no way to attach a remote shutter release.-- After taking a picture in RAW or especially RAW+JPG, it can take several seconds before the buttons begin responding again.-- Many specialty modes require reduction of resolution in order to operate, and most of them are not supported in RAW mode.-- \"Pro Photo\" mode results in significant (but probably unavoidable) digital artifacts surrounding the subject and requires that you knock down your image size to 6MP or smaller. Same image size reduction requirement for \"Pro Low-Light\".-- Maximum aperture degrades FAST as you zoom in. Zooming from 25mm to 35mm knocks down your maximum aperture to f/3.6 (!) and just past the 60mm mark you're already at your disappointing f/4.9, and that's maintained up to the maximum focal length of 100mm. Ick.*- Panorama mode images are limited in pixel height to only 1080 pixels.*- Many of the advanced modes (including all EXR modes) switch you to JPG without telling you, even if you have RAW selected.*- Heavy-handed noise reduction in JPG by default, although you can minimize it by manually setting the value to \"Low\" in the menus. Even so, I would have preferred a \"None\" option so that I could apply it in Photoshop to my own taste.Overall though, it's very positive.  If you're a JPG shooter, then PLEASE give this camera significant thought.  It really is that good.  If you're a RAW shooter or just absolutely obsessed with having the highest resolution, sharpest possible photos at the expense of everything else, then maybe there's a better camera out there for you. Like a DSLR.  For me, this camera will act perfectly as my out-on-the-town camera, when I'm not looking to lug my Canon 5D Mk II around and I also don't critically require the full potential of the bulky G12.--- UPDATE 12/10/2012 ---After using the camera consistently for the last few weeks, I thought I'd post a quick update with some additional Pros/Cons. I added them to the original list, the items with a *- at the beginning are new.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally, someone gets it right", "Author": "LgT", "ReviewID": "RMBOUR979I24Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm glad someone at Fuji knows what photographers like me are looking for in a compact camera, because almost every other compact misses the the mark for my needs. This camera is ideal for the enthusiast photographer who already has a DSLR, knows how to use it, and is looking for a pocketable compact camera to take when traveling light, without too much compromise in usability and image quality. It's for the kind of people who would have bought a Canon S95 a few years back. The kind of people who will not be sticking external flashes, filters, mics, and interchangeable lenses on a compact camera because we already have a DSLR for that purpose. The key here is the camera has to fit in a pants pocket. And the sleek retro styling is a welcome sight as well.The image quality of this camera is beyond my expectations. Set it to EXR mode, 1600% D-range, and BOOM - out pops a JPEG with more dynamic range than I could muster out of a RAW file of my Nikon D40 DSLR. Let that sink in for a second. Then save the setting to one of the custom user modes, and you have instant access to DR goodness at any time. In addition, if you set the camera to 6MP resolution, it will automatically use the DR priority feature even in regular PASM shooting modes. How about noise performance? I can use ISO 3200 with acceptable results, which is also about as good as my Nikon D40 DSLR. There are 5 noise reduction levels to choose from, and even on the lowest setting, the ugly blotches of chroma noise are well suppressed, and only the grain of luma noise is visible.The controls of this camera are exceptional as well. You have up to 11 settings available with no more than two clicks away, 7 of which can be customized by the user thanks to the E-Fn onscreen menu and the Fn button. There's also two user modes on the main dial that can store and recall your favorite settings. That's better ergonomics than any entry-level DSLR I've seen. The manual zooming provides direct, instant control over your lens, and the power on sequence becomes second nature after a few days using the camera. There is no annoying lag in operating the camera controls, and the focus speed is acceptable for a compact camera.Is there anything not to like about it? The only gripe I have with the camera is the video mode offers very limited manual controls. No audio levels, no manual exposure, no manual focus. White balance and exposure compensation can only be set before recording. It also tends to hunt with the autofocus more than I'd like. For the casual user this isn't a big deal, but serious video shooters would want to look elsewhere. However, when it comes to taking still photos, the camera certainly lived up to my lofty and picky expectations.*** Update 4/2014 ***Despite video recording being mostly automatic, I found out how to get better video in low light. Set it to Auto-ISO 800, then set soft shadow curve. Also use single-focus video mode. Focus on something 5-25 feet away, and take advantage of high depth of field to keep everything in focus (as long as you don't change the zoom), instead of hunting back and forth. Save it to a custom mode for quick access. This setting also produces very good low light still images.*** Update 5/2014 ***I find that the soft shadow curve setting and DR400 gives me the best combination of preserving highlight and shadow detail in bright daylight. DR800 and DR1600 protects highlights at all cost, but also increases ISO and disables soft shadow curve, so the darker details are not as good.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Debating of going for a cheaper FinePix or the Fujifilm XF1?  With this 1.8 Fujinon lens, better sensor...this is worth buying!", "Author": "Dennis A. Amith (kndy)", "ReviewID": "R1O9OFQC55ZX6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When it comes to digital cameras, I have been very selective over the years, especially when covering events and unable to lug around my DSLR and camera back with lenses.  So, I have been fortunate to have utilized Fujifilm digital cameras for various outdoor and indoor events.For my latest review, I am taking a look at Fujifilm's XF1 digital camera, their premium line of digital cameras and for the XF1, there are three major selling points for this camera.  First, it uses an Intelligent Retractable Lens System, second it uses a F1.8 Fujinon lens and three, not only is it compact but it features an aluminum and leather exterior.So, let's take a look and see how the Fujifim XF1 performs.I. WHAT DOES IT COME WITH?The XF1 comes with the camera, strap, NP-50A rechargeable battery, BC-508 battery charger, plug adapter, USB cable and CD-ROM which includes the software and manual.A.  BATTERY (WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW):The NP-50A 3.7V battery lasts approximately 300 frames (fully charged battery).  You can use NP-50 batteries and for those wondering if they have to be Fuji, the answer is no.  You can buy third party NP-50 batteries and fortunately, these batteries are inexpensive.  But I do recommend purchasing several if you plan to travel or take a lot of video.The battery does come pre-charged right out of the box, so you can start using it immediately and once the battery indicator shows that the battery is low, then recharge it.B.  WHAT MEMORY CARD SHOULD I BUYThe larger the card the more photos and video you can take.  Also, it depends also on quality of you set your camera on FINE or NORMAL and if you are taking JPG pictures or in RAW format.So, as a comparison between 4GB vs. 8GB4GB: Take pictures in 4:3 mode allows for 800 pictures in FINE and 1,260 pictures in NORMAL.  For video via 1080p (1920 x 1080), using a class 4 card you can not exceed 29 minutes in length.  But with a higher class, you can take 37 min. of video on 4GB.8GB: Take pictures in 4:3 mode allows for 1,590 pictures in FINE and 2,520 pictures in NORMAL.  For video via 1080p (1920 x 1080), using a class 4 card you can not exceed 29 minutes in length.  But with a higher class, you can take 74 min. of video on 4GB.But if you intend to do video and want to play it safe and are willing to spend a little more, I recommend purchasing a class 10 card 16GB, 32GB or 64GB.C.  IF I TAKE A PICTURE IN RAW WITH THE XF1, WILL IT WORK ON LIGHTROOM & PHOTOSHOP?Yes.  Back in September 2012, Fujifilm added more cameras that would work in Light room 4 Adobe Photoshop CS6.  But I was able to shoot in raw, download them to Lightroom as the files were converted from .RAF to .DNG.D.  HOW DO I TURN THE CAMERA ON AND OFF?With the Fujifilm XF1, by twisting the lens out and putting it halfway, this is standby mode as the camera is turned off temporarily in that mode.  Turn the lens until the zoom lens pops out, this puts you into shooting mode.  Twist it counter-clockwise and push the lens to achieve portable mode.  (Note: There are marks on the rings to indicate portable, standby and shooting mode).  When the camera is set to portable mode, it is off (and you won't be able to seen anything on the LCD screen.E.  IS IT A FULL 1.8 LENS?The Fujinon lens is 1.8 when the focal length is at 25mm but then you go up to 35mm and it's F3.4, 50mm at F4.2, 60mm at F4.7, 80mm at F4.9 and 100 mm at F4.9.But to retain a better focal length the higher you go, this is where you may want to look into a Fujifilm X10.As for its sensor, the XF1 has a 2/3-inch sensor with an EXR processor.  And according to Fujifilm has a start-up of .55 seconds, focus acquisition at 0.16 seconds and minimum shot-toshot time of 0.8 seconds.II. FIRST IMPRESSIONSMy first impressions of the Fujifilm XF1 is how stylish, retro and cool.  I was amazed of how thin the camera was and love the touch of leather and aluminum.As for the camera being turned on by twisting the Intelligent Retractable Lens, some may love it, others may hate it.  But I didn't mind at all.  Although, because it is retractable, I would NOT bring this camera to the beach.  This is a camera that can easily get damaged by beach sand, so I highly recommend not using this for beach use unless you can have it inside protective gear.I like the fact that the coverings are metal for the lens.  I liked the fact that when you eject the flash, it's not flimsy like the Fujifilm Finepix F800EXR, which always freaks me out that I may break the flash because of the way it was designed.The 3-inch, 460,000-dot LCD screen is nice and big but with that being said, the first thing that came into my mind is putting a protective screen because this screen can easily get scratched up if not put into some protective bag or sleeve.This is a camera that literally screams \"you get what you pay for?\" as compared to the recently released FinePix F800EXR, the XF1 has more settings and with the better 1.8 lens, also you notice the difference of quality when it came to pictures vs. its F800EXR.In fact, I felt that navigation was so much easier to use with the Fujifilm XF1.Also with the customizable functions, and the E-Fn button that can be programmed up to six functions, that's fantastic!The camera uses a mini-USB and also optional mini-HDMI port for transfer or playing movies on a big screen TV (or connecting to a receiver).  And the tripod socket is more towards the left but farther away from the battery compartment, which was good planning.For me, I have this camera on a monopod.  I'm not too confident holding this smaller camera in my big hands but it is small and compact and for those shooting in auto, will probably do fine but those who choose to shoot manually, for something this small, you're probably up-to-speed of how you feel holding smaller cameras.  Otherwise, if you are like me and used to holding DSLR's and something bigger, definitely have a monopod or tripod ready.III. TESTSThe camera features the following functions:- Automatic Mode- EXR Mode- Program AE- Shutter Priority AE- Aperture Priority AE- Manual Mode with Shutter Speed and Aperture- Custom 1 Mode - User Setting 1Custom 2 Mode - User Setting 2-  SP Mode- Advanced Mode - Using filters, panorama, etc.The camera for the most part was easy to figure out. For those who are new to using a camera, there is an included manual on the CD but for those familiar with camera settings. You are given a choice of:FILM SIMULATION - Provia/Standard, Velvia/Vivid - landscape and nature, Astia/Soft - Softer colors, more subdued look, B&W;, monochrome filters (Ye, R and G), SepiaIMAGE SIZE: (Long) 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 (Medium) 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 (Short) 4:3, 3:2, 16:9IMAGE QUALITY: Fine and NormalISO - on Automatic mode,you are given an ISO 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 4000, 5000, 6400 and 12800RAW - This camera has a RAW mode in which the files are saved as .RAF. Adobe has released the updates for Lightroom 4.2 and Adobe Raw and DNG Converter 7.2 which works with the XF1 and allows for automatic conversion to DNG.SHOOTING MENU:#1 - Allows for changing ISO, Image size and quality, dynamic range, film simulation, white balance.#2 - Allows for WB Shift, Color, Sharpness, highlight tone, shadow tone, noise reduction, intelligent digital zoom#3 - Face Detection  set-up, photometry, focus mode, focus area and function button#4 - E-Fn Button custom setting, Disp.

Shoot once, move around and shoot again. I like it!3D image - 3D image from 2 shots with each individual shutter.SP MODE SETTINGS:Natural - 2 images shot continuously without flash and with flashNatural Light - Retains natural ambiance without flashPortrait - Portrait with soft overall tone and beautiful skin tonesPortrait Enhancer - Shoots face skin, appears smoothLandscape - Clear Scenic ShotsSport - Suitable for shooting and moving subjectNight - Reduce camera shake with high ISO setting for night sceneryNight (Tripod) - Clear shots of night scenery with a slow shutterspeedFireworks - Vivid Shots of fireworks with a slow shutter speedSunset - For shooting sunsets, making colors more vividSnow - Suitable for shooting in snowy scenesBeach - Crisp, Clear Shots on the beachUnderwater - Shooting underwater with a waterproof caseParty - Suitable for shooting indoor eventsFlower - Effective for taking more vivid shots of flowersText - Effective for taking clear shots of letteringTEST I: MACROOutdoor photos using shutter speed, aperture and all modes.  Especially with flower mode.  Photos of flowers were vibrant. I was very impressed with how crisp and clear the images were turning out. Also, because of the 1.8 lens, I was able to really get good depth of field and nice bokeh.  Also, did a few shots of my watches closeup and no problem with macro shots.The next step was to try the Text mode and sure enough, I could put the camera right in front of the paper or even my monitor screen and the clarity of the closeups were very good.F-MODE BUTTON - This allows you to quickly change your ISO, image size, continuous shooting, film simulation but most interesting is the landmark navigator and geotagging setup.DISPLAY BUTTON - This allows you to set information on screen on or off, best framing, HD framing and histogram.EXR HR (High Resolution) priority mode allows the sensor to utilize all 16 megapixels for high quality resultsEXR DR (Dynamic Range) priority mode allows you to take two pictures and combine them to provide a wide dynamic range up to 1600%EXR SN (Signal to Noise) priority mode allows for pixels to be doubled up for increased sensitivity and better results in low-light.TEST: Advanced Mode - Advanced mode seem to work rather well. I have my camera set at RAW but for Panoramic 360 mode, it took it at JPG. But for those who want to be creative will enjoy this many filters and modes. Panoramic allows for high resolution at 180, 240 or 360 degree ranges.TEST: FLASH - Flash seemed to work very well and was able to get a good burst rate of around 7 photos with flash going off and no waiting after each shot.  I was impressed by this considering the F800EXR had to wait awhile after each shot with a flash.TEST: Zoom - The camera seems to favor shooting closer distances such as a macro or portrait.  Some shots areTEST: Video - Video recorded perfectly and clear. It shoots at 1080p HD at 30 FPS. It's important to note that the Mics are positioned right near the bottom of the lens, so it will pick up mechanical noise.  And there is no mic input on this camera.  But this is a common occurrence with digital cameras and for those who want better control over sound (especially video) will want to spend a bit a bit more on a DSLR such as a Canon T2i, T3i or T4i.TEST: ISO Low-light/No FlashAs one expects on high ISO, while things worked as expected (I just don't like shooting at 3200 or higher), you're going to see noise and not sure if anyone will use the 12800 ISO setting but if you want less noise, it's best to stay at ISO 100-800.TEST: Chromatic AberrationShooting a lot of flowers with the white background, I was expecting to see some purple fringing but surprisingly, this camera did hold up quite well for the chromatic aberration test.TEST: INCLUDED SOFTWAREFor those who don't use Lightroom or Photoshop, included with the camera is FUJIFILM's software and SilkyPix Raw Converter which allows you to modify the .RAF file but export only as JPG.  I was able to use the SilkyPix Raw Convertor perfectly. But I do recommend using software like Adobe Lightroom or Aperture or Photoshop to have better control over RAW files.JUDGMENT CALL:Overall, The Fujfilm XF1 is definitely a premium digital camera.  While I gave good reviews for the F800 EXR for its bells and whistles for its price range, the XF1 delivers with a better lens and sensor and  I was quite impressed of how sharp the photos were turning out with the XF1 camera.I do feel the camera works best to shoot at closer distances, i.e. macro or portrait shots rather than using the telephoto, as the camera does slow down to F4.9.As for the Intelligent Retractable Lens, some may love it, while others may not but for me, I don't mind it, but as mentioned earlier, going to beach?  Don't bring this camera as any sand that gets into this retractable lens will probably make things worse.  So, try not to use this camera at the beach or anywhere near the sand.But this is a solid and stylish camera overall.  I do wish that it did incorporate it's wi-fi capability like the more cheaper FinePix cameras.  The camera is light overall, but I also recommend putting a protective screen on the LCD.The camera does come with a lot of bells and whistles but with the premium camera wars becoming highly competitive with the cheaper Canon PowerShot S100 and the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX100 which cost slightly a bit more than the XF1, I still feel the look and feel and what this camera offers for its price range is fantastic.For those debating of going for this camera or the FinePix EXR series, I highly recommend the XF1 as the F1.8 Fujinon lens makes a big difference.  Slick, stylish and cool...Fujifilm's XF1 is highly recommended!", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Issues with focusing and macro shots", "Author": "Jonny", "ReviewID": "R1AKWIA09OK4MD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few months now, and have used it for a few trips, as well as for hikes around North Carolina. This camera has a few aspects that I really like. In some settings it really takes great photos. In high contrast situations the EXR-dynamic range function works great to make sure that nothing is over or under exposed. In sunny and cloudy conditions, the pictures come out crystal clear and with great looking colors using the white balance presets. The manual zoom is nice as you can very quickly turn on the camera, zoom, and take a picture.In low light conditions, and for close up shots, I've found the auto focus terrible. For macro, this camera focuses correctly about 10% of the time for me, and in low light there's only a slight improvement. I bought this camera when it was first released at $500, and I would certainly expect better for this price. If I could do it again I would buy a different camera, as though this camera has some great features, they don't justify the original $500, or the new $400 price tag.This is partly my fault as I bought this online without testing, but it still reflects on the camera quality. If you're looking for macro or low-light functionality, I'd advise looking elsewhere.Update 11-21-2013 (1 year after purchase), changed from 3 to 2 stars:On a recent trip to West Africa, the exposures on my photos started acting up. In daylight, almost every photo was overexposed with portions of the photo washed out. About 25% of the photos were completely washed out (i.e. full white photos). Turning the camera on and off, using auto, changing metering modes, turning down the exposure compensation, nothing worked. I was glad I'd purchased a SquareTrade warranty, as I got my money back. I just ordered the Fujifilm X-E2, as I decided I wanted a more manual camera, and I figured a second-gen camera would have less problems than this one.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fuji XF1,  this is a big step up from your average pointy shooty camera.", "Author": "GD from ND", "ReviewID": "R1WOHVEJZDRD2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not the kind of guy that is easily impressed by TV ads but when I saw the ad for the Fuji XF1 I fell in love with it.The more I read about it the better I like it and the idea that the image sensor was seriously bigger than the 2.3 sensor in the Canon SX 120 that was my primary camera offered intriguing possibilities since I like to take pictures in poor lighting conditions. I was a little leery about spending $400 on this camera since my Canon had cost less than 1/2 that amount, but I did spend the money and I have been very happy with my purchase.I thought I would miss the longer zoom length of my Canon but I don't very much. The 4x zoom of the XF1 may seem a little puny but the 2x digital zoom is quite excellent and is good enough to use and expect a good results. So The XF1 has a useful zoom range equivalent of about 25mm to 200mm.The EXR mode works well and makes great photos but I usually use the camera in Auto mode and love those results. The sunset / sunrise mode is one I really like. The stuff you don't care about seems minimized and the sky colors are beautifully emphasized. With some cameras Sunset mode messes with the colors with the XF1 the existing colors are emphasized.I can get excellent available light photos at night outside without having to use a tripod and I rarely need the flash indoors.Some reviewers have complained about how fumbly it is to turn on and off. I don't agree. It is a different procedure to be sure but it becomes second nature after a few uses.The camera has a look and feel of a well made 35mm rangefinder camera from years ago and it is a pleasure to use. If you are looking for a higher quality camera without getting into a DSLR try the XF1 I think you'll be happy with it.Pros:It takes excellent pictures.Good battery life.Quality feel of metal construction.Cons:The Movie button is easy for me to accidentally hit.The manual focus feature has no distance scale.By the way there is a book available from Amazon on using the Fuji X10 that explains all the features of the XF1 if the owners guide leaves you a little cold.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "A high end point and shoot", "Author": "SLim NZ", "ReviewID": "RL8FQHPHWDDG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have the camera for over 2+ months.

I do find that I feel as though I need to be extra careful when taking it out of its locked position into standby mode, as I think it would be easy to break it if care isn't taken while doing it.  This alone makes the camera one that some wouldn't like as durability may be an issue.  (Of course care should always be taken, but hey, kids, students, casual users... folks in a hurry, might not!)The flash works well, but you have to manually engage it.  I didn't mind that, liked it actually, but some beginner and intermediate digital camera users may not.I wish that in addition to the LCD screen it also had an eyepiece type viewfinder.  So few compact digital cameras have them, but I wish they all did as I've had more than one digital camera's LCD go out.  If you have that viewfinder, you can often still use the camera when that happens.One of the greatest features of this camera is the speed at which it focuses and snaps a photo.  I used a SDHC Class 10 card with it, which helps, but the camera itself is just speedier than others I've used at the same price point.Some really like the retro look to this camera, which to me is the thing I like least.  Not ugly, just boxy.  The texture does make it easy to hold on to though.The battery charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time, which I like alot.The timer can be set to 2 or 10 seconds and photos I've taken using it, come out well focused.The manual focus option is a nice one, but I found that for me the 'auto' worked well.  Depress the button smoothly and the focus and photo snap occur within 1-2 seconds.  Very fast with great results.You can easily take a closer look at whatever photos you take by using the scroll on the back of the camera to zoom on the shot for review.  The menu wheel allows you to scroll left, right, up and down, and really see your shot before deciding whether or not to keep it.  I liked that!It is easy to delete shots very quickly.  I found that out the hard way when I inadvertently deleted a photo I wanted to keep.There are a lot of manual tweaks you can make with this camera, but it can also be enjoyed by novice and intermediate users.  The HD video quality is great with this camera too, but audio pick-up is lacking so it probably won't replace a digital camcorder, but will work in a pinch.The design and function of this camera is excellent, as is the build quality.  I expect that most users will find it their go-to camera once they get comfortable with the unique design.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Remarkable output and performance, with some quirks", "Author": "Michael C. Jackson \"MysticMCJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3FCDQDH3QSP4W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has become my new compact camera of choice...  I looked at a few others in the running, and I decided to take a leap of faith on the Fuji, as I've been impressed with their quality in the new X series.Everyone seems to talk about the way it turns on - which you either love or hate.  I find it a bit comical how much Fuji has to remind you of how it works, with labels everywhere, supplemental manuals, etc.  It's something I got used to quickly, and generally like.  I can see how it isn't for everyone.  It doesn't slow me down in the least, and I have not once turned it off by accident... Anyone doing that is very heavy handed.The JPG output is VERY nice.  I don't shoot raw in compact - Know that the EXR sensors tend to be a bit difficult in raw, but in my opinion, if you are getting this to shoot raw, you either have the wrong purpose in mind for this camera, or the wrong camera in mind for your purpose.  It can be done, and I'm no stranger to raw in general - it just seems a bit silly with this camera.This is the camera that you take with you EVERYWHERE to get shots you wouldn't otherwise have, or in place of lugging around something larger - You get it if you are looking for something pocketable with a good degree of control, an excellent sensor, and wonderful output that doesn't need much post processing.If you are looking for something with a ton of direct manual controls, well, this may be a bit of a disappointment - and this is what I don't understand about this camera, because from a hardware perspective, it has a lot that could enable this in the two dials.Frustratingly, these two dials do nothing most of the time...  You cannot assign them to arbitrary functions, and this is the ONE thing keeping me from giving it a five star rating...  How hard would it have been to allow one to be assigned to exposure compensation, for example?  Or maybe ISO?  That's one of the features we LOOK for in these cameras - easily used direct controls, and given the market, this is inexplicable!You can still do relatively easy exposure compensation, by clicking \"up\" first and then using either dial, but really, this seems like a massive oversight.When you CAN use the dials, they oftentimes do the exact same thing.  It's a complete waste of what could have been an INCREDIBLY customizable direct control system.And don't kid yourself - How often do you actually use A mode in a compact?  That's one place where they work...  May be of some use if you use S.  M is almost useless on this camera (and truly, most compacts) due to the lack of any preview of any sort, no matter how accurate it would or wouldn't be.  These are the only two modes where you can use one dial without being in a submenu, and the other one - again, outside of menus - is only used for manual focus.So to be blunt - They are just about useless, and could have been so much more.  I'm really hoping there's a firmware update to enable this, but I'm not holding my breath.So why, with those gripes, do I even rate it this high?Because despite those GLARING flaws, the handling and response is otherwise impeccable, and the image quality is worlds beyond my expectations.  The EXR modes are also very handy, and some of the advanced \"trick\" modes are actually useful, for a change.But really, it's about how great your pictures can come out, and how easily you can compose, right?  And it's easy to compose with the stepless zoom, and the response is wonderful.  As it stands, the auto white balance and exposure have been spot on, so I haven't HAD to tweak those.  The camera does a very good job, with few exceptions...  It may seem like a slap in the face to us photographers to have the camera think through so much for us, but it generally does very well with this.And again, the output is ASTOUNDING for a camera this size.  Definitely far above any other camera in this class that I have used - It won't replace your DSLR for low light, but it will come closer than you'd expect.So excellent quality, responsiveness, and ability to compose, and an excellent build quality as well - It could easily be 5 stars, if ONLY those dials could be made useful... That's all that is holding it back.That being said, it still has become my go-anywhere-a-DSLR-can't-or-won't camera, and I have been very very impressed with the output.Using the FN button for ISO leaves a usable solution for MOST of the controls you need easy access to - but I still would have preferred the ability to set compensation without touching a menu.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Mini x100", "Author": "Thomas W.

I have only owned the camera about a month so obviously I cannot attest to its longevity. But other than that, this little beast is a dynamo. Leave it wide open on 25mm, set it on EXR auto, and bang away. Like the x100, exceptional skin tones. Perfect skin tones! Inside, outside, low light, bright light, snow, dusk, incandescent, fluorescent--the results are very good or better for a camera this portable. No doubt the others I investigated were very nice also but I choose the xf1 and a fine choice it was.  35 years ago when I first got started in photography I bought a used Nikkormat with an 85mm lens. It cost far more than this xf1. $199 for everything in this little package--amazing! People complain too much. We've become far too picky.

In short, this camera is terrific.1.  What's in the box:  Your receive the camera, a battery, USB connector, Manual and CD, lanyard for the camera and a charger with an American plug.2.  Aesthetic:  The camera is a pleasing retro-design.  This means that at first glance, the camera appears to be something out of the 60's for film.  Yet, you see the screen on the back, plus the buttons and you realize this is a modern camera with all the attendant features.  The black 'faux' leather gives a nice look, but also provides a nice grip on the camera.  The camera (which is about the size of your hand with fingers extended), has a LCD screen with good resolution that is about 2\" x 3\".  There is a rotating dial on the top for choosing different photo features, plus a pop-up for the flash.  On the right to the screen, there is a rotating dial (varying features), plus a 'play' button, a 'record' button, plus a display button and 'function' button on the bottom.  In the middle of these buttons, there is the main button for menu items, flash and other features.  Something that is interesting is the rotating circle feature that surrounds the main button (more on that in a moment).  Also, the memory card (uses a standard SD/HC card) and battery case is on the bottom along withFrankly, at first, I wasn't sure about the camera.  It looked kind of cheap and cheesy, but now I absolutely LOVE the retro look.  It is great!  This is a very neat looking camera.  I do recommend purchasing a screen protector (many are available) to protect the camera.  So, I love the look and feel of this camera.3.  Use:  Great!  Some basics:  to turn the camera on, you reach for the lens ring and rotate and pull it out.  The first position is standby (low-power mode) and then the final turn (which pulls out the lens) turns the camera on for use.  (you can also hit the 'play' button to do this to view pictures.The screen is the only method for taking pictures (there is no viewfinder).  Yes, the camera is point and click, but the user needs to realize that while focus is automatic, you can change the range by rotating the lens.  At first, this seems ridiculous, but after use, I think this is a great design as it gives the user an ability to take pictures beyond 'point and click.'One feature that is appreciated is the rotating dial to go through pictures during view mode.  This seems very intuitive and a smart feature I have not seen before.  Excellent.  Also, getting to the many features (too many to describe here) is easy using the main button, or through rotation of the features button on the top.  The auto mode is very easy to use, but I really like the ability to make the camera a bit more manual, which gives the ability to make the camera beyond a point and click to almost a DSLR without the hassle.Picture quality:  After taking pictures in many different situations, I am quite pleased.  The ISO response is really excellent, and the ability of the camera to take good pictures without the flash is pretty amazing.  Using some of the features to take pictures in 'manual' mode really helps as well.  The color-saturation also seems excellent.  Focus is good, and the lack of auto-focus (remember you use the lens to focus) actually gives the feeling of more control over the picture.  Results are quite stunning.  I have taken many pictures, and despite the noise due to a short exposure, the picture results are quite good in auto feature.  Results can be made better with the various methods to manually control ISO and other features.Pros:There are many things to like, if not love, about this camera.  Upon first glance, the retro look may be off-putting, but this makes the camera a very nice looking item.  Picture quality is excellent.  The many features mean that this goes way beyond a simple point and shoot.  After some adjustment, the pull-focus lens seems logical and a nifty feature.  Also, battery power seems excellent as the use of manual range instead of using battery power means the camera will last a long time.Neutral:Hmmm.  I haven't found much to quibble about here.Cons:Well, this is an expensive camera.  No doubt about it.  But, I think a potential buyer must weigh the great quality and pictures, plus the neat look and features.  If you are looking for a top-shelf non-DSLR, this is definitely one to consider.Overall:  No doubt this is an expensive camera.  However, though the sticker price is quite shocking at first, I have come to appreciate the quality of the camera in build and quality of pictures.  I have used this camera in many situations and  remain impressed.  In fact, I become more impressed with the many features available for this camera.

But I hated the quality of most photos from my ipad or phone, so lugging gear seemed necessary. Photos from other point and shoots or iPhone often looked unimpressive. Too used to 1.8 or 2.8 lenses and excellent pro level sensors. Had read great things about the fuji x series, and picked this one up on a bit of a whim when the price fell to $199. Honestly didn't expect much for the price, was just hoping for a step up from an ipad picture and better performance in low light with a decent focal range for weekend getaways. Figured if it was a disappointment, could sell it on ebay pretty easily.Fuji menus never intimidated me, since I have owned three s5 pros in the past. I find them easy to navigate, and like the manual zoom and on off switch on this camera. Took a day or two to get used to it.Summary:  This camera is amazing for it's size and price point. Photos taken with certain settings at times look like they were shot with a pro dslr and a high quality wide aperture lens. Low light performance is surprisingly good. Noise at higher ISO's is far less than expected. Advanced settings like double exposures are fun, and allow for more creativity and artistic freedom than I expected. Haven't bothered with RAW, since fuji jpegs were always pretty perfect straight out of camera, and this camera holds that tradition intact.The 'pro focus' mode gives dreamy bokeh that looks quite a lot like an 85 mm wide open portrait lens took the shot if you move the zoom to that level. I used this camera for a macro ring shot during a snowy engagement session last weekend, and was impressed with how it handled both the lighting and the details of the diamonds and snowflakes.Summary: worth far more than I paid for it. Pleasantly surprised. And cute retro look. Battery life is fine, not sure what other reviewers referred to about it losing half it's power overnight.

I used it for over a week taking lots of pictures and didn't believe that I had never charged the battery until I realized that the charger was still unwrapped in the box.  The only thing this camera has going against it is that it's got a couple of manual features that I guess are there for effect - and to make you more engaged in picture taking ... manual zoom, manual flash ... so if you really want a camera that you can turn on with a button and have everything else powered digitally, you may not like this.  However, if you like the idea of a more manual interaction with your camera .... manual zoom, manual flip up of the flash ... then this camera is the best quality point-and-shoot you're going to find.

So, I thought I'd see if getting my very first compact would help me get back into the habit of shooting.Now, the camera: since it's very pocketable -- even more than my EP1 with a pancake lens -- I bring it with me more places. Since the lens is fast on the wide end, I can take pictures in most of the same situations as with a higher end camera, though with a reasonable but acceptable hit to image quality. And since the DR is so good in the EXR modes, I can get photos with a sufficient detail for my taste without having to edit them.I weighed this camera against the Panasonic LX7 for the fast lens and Fujifilm X20 for the viewfinder and longer lens that's faster at the long end. I am glad I didn't get the X20 since it's less pocketable, though I do think the LX7 would have been a solid performer as well. I figured I could shoot wide if I needed speed in low light with the XF1, but the LX7 would certainly be more flexible in low light.I shoot more now and I always bring my camera with me in my backpack or jacket pocket.

Or would anyone?As far as \"looks\", this camera looks like a camera from the 80's with synthetic leather. I contacted Fuji on why they didn't use genuine leather on a $499 camera and I was told the synthetic will \"wear better\". I guess time will tell.  I also questioned a camera costing $499 (at this time) being Chinese-made when I saw Japanese-made XF1s on a couple other review web sites, and I received this response from Fuji: \"All XF1s sold in the USA are made at the Fujifilm factory in China, and all of our products are manufactured to the highest quality levels regardless of place of manufacture\".This is a heavy camera for its size, weighs 7.9 ounces and appears solidly built. The tripod mount is metal but not centered.  Battery life is excellent. Processing speed between shots is fast even when using the flash.

There's a sticker on top of the camera (a little hard to remove) as well as a hang tag and a pamphlet inside the box.Things I like:>> Sensor size is larger than what you get on most newer P&S; cameras, CMOS too!>> Low light capability, you can take a photo in a room with very little light with no flash and it turns out good, not grainy.>> High speed video (which actually turns out to be slow-motion on playback).>> Pro Focus - This I love! - Now I can just about do away with Aperture Priority to get the results I want in blurred backgrounds.>> EXR, scenes or full manual controls.>> The synthetic leather makes it easy to grip.>> Great battery life.>> Manual flash, I actually prefer manual over the ones that pop up, usually right where your finger is holding onto the camera. You have to make a conscious effort with a manual flash when popping it up to not hold your finger there!>> Horizontal leveler (no tilted photos with this!)>> Function button - reminiscent of the F button on my old Fuji F30 but now you can customize the functions for quick access to settings you use most.>> A printed-on-paper full size instruction manual.Things I don't like:>> I hate the power on/off - manual focus feature - maybe in time I will get used to it; there's a definite learning curve.>> Forget about manual zoom during a movie...yes, you can do it, but without a zoom motor it's jerky and you stand a good chance of getting your finger in front of the lens - plus you can hear the zoom noise during playback - I don't care for this, but since I rarely use zoom during a movie, it's not a deal-breaker for me personally, but it probably is for many of you.  (I uploaded a video on YouTube - I am Yarii41 there).The Bottom Line:  If you're new to digital photography and want a camera that can keep you happy for a long time, this is a good one to choose. It's almost too much for a newbie, but you can start out with it set to EXR and it's like a basic P&S; camera.  Set the dial to SP and you have all the scenes to choose from like any other camera.  Set it to P A S or M and you have a whole set of new options to learn.  As long as you don't mind the manual zoom during a movie, I think just about anyone not quite ready for a DSLR camera would be happy with this, as it takes fantastic photos - possibly the best photos I've ever taken.So far, these are 2 inexpensive cases I've found that will fit this.

As of 01/13/2014, no notification from Fuji as to the arrival of the camera.01/21/2014: Finally calling Fuji to see what's up with the camera as they haven't contacted me yet.  First of all, don't use the extension 3461 that's on their website for repairs.  It's invalid.  Just stay on the line and go through the menu.  Note: The XF1 is considered a professional camera so choose that option.  Talked with the first rep.  He claimed the EXACT same thing as in the other review/complaint.  They're saying that there's \"impact damage\" to the bottom of the camera so it invalidates the warranty.  $140 repair/$18 shipping/$11 tax total.  I told him that there wasn't an \"impact damage\" and he's transferred me after I told him that I shot a video of the camera --showing no damage whatsoever-- before I sent it in as I thought they might say that.  After 20 minutes on hold, this tech is going to grab the camera after I told him there wasn't any damage to the camera.  He's claiming that there *is* damage and I'm telling him that a lot of people are having this problem and it has nothing to do with any impact.  I also let him know that I shot a close up video of our camera before I sent it in to prove there wasn't any so called \"impact damage\".  With this, this second guy wants to transfer me to his manager but his manager apparently \"isn't in\".  He took down my number to have the manager call me back. After a couple hours I'm doubting they will. In the meantime, I just dropped Fuji Japan a complaint off their website.  Will this do anything?  Maybe if enough people contact them.01/21/2014 part two: Got a call back.  Same tech.  He said he talked to his manager and they're going to drop the charges and repair the camera.  I hope they do and that this error doesn't come up again.  If it's just in the DNA of this camera to have this problem, then I would guess the repair won't last long.  However, I'm glad they decided to honor their warranty like they should.  If you plan on sending in your XF1 or anything to Fuji Repairs, I would recommend that you take a video of your camera including close ups if your problem/need of repair isn't due to owner fault.  You'll need it as they seem to follow the step-by-step guidelines of Warranty Disqualification 101.  Our camera didn't have any dings or scratches and was never dropped.  Many are having this problem with this camera but the repair facility says it's always due to \"impact damage\".  Will follow up when I receive the camera back from them.01/29/2014.  Sigh.  Fuji just sent me another invoice for the repairs identical to the last one.  Will have to call them again to find out if they lied to me about dropping the charges.  Okay, all's well with this repair still.They said it takes the system some time to renew and the 2nd invoice/repair estimate was sent out automatically but their records reflect the dropped charges.

In my broad experience with DSLRs and similarly priced point-and-shoot models like the Canon S95 and S110, I've never used a camera that just got it right every single time. The manual lens is great, makes accurate zooming quick and accurate, and the unconventional way of turning it on (by actually pulling out the lens) ensures that you'll never have to shell out $120 to replace a lens motor because it turned on and burned out trying to extend the lens while inside a case (S95, I'm looking at you).My XF1 never leaves it's EXR auto setting because it automatically compensates for almost every variation of a scene to produce the best pictures, increasing ISO and shutter speed if it detects a shaky hand or a moving subject, binning to a lower resolution to boost sensitivity if the scene is dark and flash is not enabled or binning to boost dynamic range if the scene has extreme contrast, in any of these situations it just works, without fuss, and produces gorgeous images.

The Fuji XF1 does not disappoint. To me, it's almost a hybrid between a compact digital and an SLR (minus interchangeable lenses). I've been able to get some absolutely stunnning photos with this.Between the fairly large sensor and the brilliant lens, photo quality is very high. What's really a winner for me are some of the simulated film settings and the low light features.Want to take non-flash low-light handheld photos? Who doesn't. The low light features - including f 1.8, very high ISOs, and the ability to combine multiple exposures automatically make it a breeze (and produce excellent results).I am amazed at the quality of shooting monochrome with this gem. There are a number of monochrome film and filter simulation settings, so you can shoot pretty portraits or stunning landscapes.The \"advanced\" features, like in camera panorama creation, and toy camera simulation are neat to play with too.Being used to an SLR - using manual zoom is not difficult. A couple of minutes and you'll be used to the mechanics of operation. You'll have to play with it for a bit to learn all the various settings - because there are so many. However - you can just switch to auto mode any time for quick snapshots.I recently attended a birthday party with this camera (and there were a bunch of people taking pictures there).

Recently bought both and extensively tested them. Decision as to which one to keep was very difficult.Here is the short version why I kept the Fujifilm and returned the Nikon, though overall the Nikon was a more complete and \"safe\" choice.First would be the appearance. Really special and classy. The Nikon looks OK and average.Then, while doing fewer things well than the Nikon, it does them better. So it depends on one's needs, but I assessed which capabilities were the most important to me, and for these, the Fuji performed better.Now lots of details.FUJIFILM XF1============Pros----* really good handling. Fits well in hands (I am a man with what I think are average size hands), and the 2-handed position insures easy and safe operation. While there is only a minimal thumb grip in back, leathery surface insures good, safe grip. Dimensions/weight are just right, in that they allow real pocketability, while offering good handling (the large lens barrel, and resulting lack of room for right hand grip, is biggest reason why I did not consider the Sony RX-100).* well-placed and convenient controls. Position of the main control wheel (upper one) is especially good, and the E-Fn button is very handy (allows quick access to 4 - user-selectable - settings, like ISO, White Balance, ....). A bunch of other touches includes quick brightening of display in sunlit situations, by depressing the E-Fn button for a few seconds. All in all, it allowed me to operate the camera faster and more enjoyably than the Nikon. I also found menu navigation quicker and more pleasant to use than the Nikon.* Highly responsive. Fast focus, even in low-light, but in-camera processing is quick as well, as in the case of long exposures (night shots).* panorama mode, while demanding more attention than Nikon's, allows user-determined sweep. That is, unlike the Nikon which enforces set sweeps, the Fujifilm allows partial sweeps. That is, even if mode is set to 180 degrees, one can stop at say 137 degrees (or 154 ....) as the scene demands it. May not seem like much, but makes for much better panoramas.* sophisticated bundled software (SilkPix) for editing RAW pictures (the one for JPEG is a joke - useless)* film simulations (obviously the Fuji ones - Provia, Velvia, .., but also various styles of B&W;, ...) are nice and with immediate feedback (unlike the Nikon where you set it, then observe result and possibly go back for more tweaking. More work and tediousness)* on-screen information display highly customizable, which can result in a cleaner, more useful display* auto WB and exposure a tad better than the Nikon* colors slightly more pleasant than the Nikon* separate battery charger* did I mention that it looks really nice and cool ?Cons----* zoom lens construction feels flimsy, and frankly a cause of concern about its durability. Just does not feel very solidly built, and when zoom is extended, there is some play in the lens barrel. I hope it does not lead to problems, but to me, that is the number one mark against this camera.* noisy videos. Can hear clearly kind of a shuffling sound on any video shot. Thought it may have been a defect till I read the manual that explicitly states there may be some lens noises recorded (and no way around it). So, if you are really interested in taking videos, avoid this camera.* rather short battery life* compared to the Nikon, slightly less detailed daylight pictures* more limited zoom range than the Nikon, especially noticeable at wide angle. While the official difference seems minimal (25 mm for Fuji vs 24 mm for the Nikon), in real-life, the Nikon is significantly wider angle than the Fuji.* electronic manual does not have a navigation tree. Makes finding desired topic/subject slower.Nikon Coolpix P330==================Pros----* solid construction. Feels definitely more rugged than the Fuji* combination of good thumb grip and front vertical strip allows one-handed operation* better zoom range than the Fuji (24 - 120 mm)* integrated GPS* longer lasting battery* (slightly) sharper daylight images* quicker operation out of pocket (this due to the slightly convoluted way for turning on the Fujifilm)* better flash operation, that is resulting pictures have a more natural, less \"flashy\" look than those taken with the Fuji.* good supplied software. Much superior to Fuji for JPEG, less obvious for RAW (Nikon's is simpler, and while the Fuji is more complicated, but also more capable)* better manual than the Fuji. Offers navigation tree, while the Fuji does not (what a mistake !)Cons----* much less responsive than the Fuji. To me this is the weakest point against this camera and the main reason I went for the Fuji. This is apparent mostly on two fronts. Focus in low-light is seriously slow, and at times near impossible. Also interval between shots at night is long (did not time them but anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds) because of processing. These things can lead to missed pictures.* panorama mode is mixed bag. On one hand, very easy to use .... BUT if one wants to record less than the set angle (either 180 or 360 degrees), a dark bar will complete the picture. Say one is set to 180 and only wants/needs 135 degree view. The camera will fill remaining 55 degrees with unsightly black bar.* on-screen display information not very customizable, and is a bit too much (hard to isolate what is real important)* max aperture value is f=8 (Fuji goes to f=11. Though Nikon has a ND filter integrated)* in-camera charging (no separate charger)* ordinary appearanceThat's it !

I was getting \"LENS CONTROL ERROR\". The manual says I needed to context FUJIFILM dealer. So I did, at 1-800-659-3854. I was immediately transferred to a real person, who couldn't have been more helpful. I told him I needed the camera by end of next week (less than 14 days.) He told me to send the order receipt (easy since I got it from Amazon little less than a year ago) and put the camera in a box with bubblewrap to prevent it from getting damaged during shipping it to Edison, NJ. It cost me about $5 to ship the camera. And just today, 2 whole days before when I needed it, I received the camera in fully working condition. The lens and the grips had to be replaced. Grips, because when the camera is taken apart the grips can't be put back--so send the camera in, don't try to fix it yourself. I called 800 number again and asked what was wrong with the lens: was it a particulate that went into the lens system? They said they don't spend much time investigating the cause and they replaced entire lens system with a new one. We left it at that. But, wow, what a service! Another great reason to buy a Fujifilm digital camera. Very, very happy.Updated on June 15, 2013:This camera is still my primary camera. Its manual turn on/off by the lens is proving to be more revolutionary in digital camera design than I thought earlier.There are 2 things I can suggest to make this camera better:1: the display in the back needs to be OLED so that I can see the images I've taken better; under sunlight it's very difficult to see it and I'm compelled to take more pictures in case I missed something.2: the flash can be re-positioned from far left where my left-hand would hold the camera for stability. On several occasions my hand holding the camera covered the flash.Updated on April 13, 2013:This camera is amazing and has been my primary camera for some time now. Today I wanted to take a raw image and it wasn't intuitively clear to me how to do this.

Press the right arrow and go to raw mode to enable it.Updated on Nov. 30, 2012:If you need to access the internal memory of the camera, take out the memory card and plug in the USB cable. You will then be able to see the files in the internal memory (max. 25 MB).Original Review:No more battery wasting on silly zooming when you can control it manually!That's a great feature of this camera. Of course it takes great pictures, gazillion pixels, you name it.Turning it on and off may need some getting used to it, but if it extends the battery life and gives you greater control, it's worth it. There is an additional benefit to this kind of on/off mechanism. I tend to keep the camera in my pocket most of the time. With some cameras that have their on/off switch conspicuously there is a chance of inadvertent telescoping of the lens system...in your pocket.XF1 also sports Fujifilm proprietary EXR feature, which is enabled by turning the dial at the top of the camera. It lets you take AMAZING pictures. When you switch to this mode, press the menu key and you will have three options to select from. These are the priority settings for the context you're imaging:  very high resolution (RESOLUTION PRIORITY),  very low light (HIGH ISO & LOW NOISE),  very high contrast--bright and dark mixed (D-RANGE PRIORITY).That's it really, just select one of those.This camera has 12 Mega-Pixels, but don't let dissuade you. The more pixels there are, the more noise there is likely to be in the image.The chassis of the camera is very exquisite. It has the look of an old fashioned camera, but the feel of a sleek advanced alien technology.Very highly recommended.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "do not buy this camera", "Author": "Dimitris", "ReviewID": "R30KSLR5RRD7PF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "6 month after purchase exposure went haywire around the telephoto end.

I've owned a Fujifilm X100 and X10, and I'm a huge fan of their fixed lens X-series cameras. Both those cameras served me well, yet I was looking for a camera more appropriate to my latest photographic project, which is taking a picture each day for a year. The X100 and X10 *are* pocketable. However, with their size and weight, you're always aware that they're sitting there in your pocket. There's no escaping that. Thus, when the XF1 was introduced, I was intrigued. It's been favorably compared to the X10 and seems that those two cameras are near twins in terms of overall abilities, save the obvious difference that the X10's OVF makes. I'm about a week into owning this camera and I am pleased as all with it. The XF1 does seem a more svelte version of the X10, and IQ is comparable, which means excellent. I get the wonderfully blue and red saturated Fujifilm \"look\" and, if I feel silly, the on-board filters will create amusing results, like a miniature \"diorama\" or panoramic view. And in contrast to the X100 and X10, I find I can stuff the XF1 into my pocket all day long, so it's literally always at hand for my daily photographic inspiration, wherever that may be. The XF1 has been criticized as being \"quirky\" in its manner of operation and menus. I would say that is a matter of perspective. Coming from an X100 and X10, that quirkiness is what I expect and, to me, the XF1 is familiar and comforting. I guess I like it's quirkiness, whatever that might be.

It's pocketable, stylish and fun to use.  The manual zoom is great for manual style photography and it's quick unlike a slow power zoom on the Panasonic LX7.  Turning the camera on and off is quirky to say the least and is probably the main reason this camera never took off.  It's not a good thing when Fuji plasters the camera with instructions on how to turn the camera on.  Overall JPEGs straight out of the camera look great.  Color is well saturated and skin tones are accurate and very appealing.  Much better than any other camera manufacturer including Canon.  The 2/3\" Fuji sensor does well in low light along with the EXR modes which further enhance sensitivity.However my main issue with the camera and the reason I returned it is the poor video mode.  In video mode, the camera can't focus.  It's completely unusable indoors.  The focus constantly racks back and forth.  I'd even overlook this if there was an option to manually focus.  But there is no option for manual focus in video mode.  Which is too bad because when the camera was actually in focus I could tell the quality of the footage was good.  Nonetheless I need a compact camera to do good video and the Fuji fails in this regard.To sum it up, if you don't plan on shooting any video at all (not even a little) and want something that is stylish and pocketable then this is your camera.

I have Olympus SLR and had a dream to substitute my heavy SLR in some cases with this pretty thing. So, I can but not so often as I hoped.  Important events still need SLR.Pro- Picture quality. Yes, sensor size matters. Definitely. Quality is comparable with SLR- Picture quality in the low light conditions. Pictures are amazing.- Manual on/off and manual zoom. I like this. Yes, it needs some skills but as soon as you have learned it (one day enough), it's convenient and instantly fast. And pretty, too.- Speed. Focus is very fast, switching on is instant.Cons- Speed. Although focus is fast and shutter lag is small, frame-to-frame delay is substantial. Seems so strange because it looks like easiest lag to solve (just add cashed memory for background record)- Speed with flash. For some reason, flash is always with \"red eye reduction\" on. It causes pre-flash with delay. Making photos of fast moving objects (e.g. kids) simply not possible.- Control. Some kind of mess. You have different modes \"EXR\", \"SP\" and \"Adv\", pretty the same. What a mess! Since this is an enthusiast camera, you have quite big amount of different settings - sharpness, film simulation, and so on. In some modes you have some settings which set to default with power cycle. In some- not. Some settings are camera-wide. Some not. In some modes you have one range of settings, in other - others. Even don't try to remember all this correlations and dependences, it's not possible. Especially because this is power but still point-and-shot camera not for professional usage. You will use it not every day for hundreds of photos but only during your next vacations. And of course, you will forget details even if you studied them now. I really miss simple and logic but powerful control of my SLR where I can change everything in seconds. Why is it so here? The number of buttons is the same. Display is suitable for the same information. Why not just make the same interface?- Manual control. For some reason, switching off the camera to stand-by mode is made as rotating zoom toward wide angle. So easy to switch the camera in the most important moment.ConclusionPicture quality is great, camera looks nice but you cannot use it in case of important event for two main reasons - lack of speed and difficult of control.The overall impression - the camera looks like someone's idea.

What I do know, is that the 2/3 sensor captures incredible image detail - it's absolutely no comparison to a any of the point and shoots on the market.  This article [...] provides a great insight as to why the sensor size is important, more so than megapixels.At first, I wasn't too sure about the twist the lense to turn it on - I thought what a funky little camera - but after a few uses I absolutely fell in love - picture quality is well above any camera I've ever owned (I don't have a dslr), and I like the feel of this in the hand, it has a real nice high quality weight to it, as well as the feel of twisting the lens to turn on and also to manual zoom - it just feels right.

I bought this camera as a \"learner\" for my girlfriend, and have found myself tinkering with it far more often than she does.Let's start with what caught your eye first: the camera is absolutely gorgeous. Whenever it is brought out, it receives numerous compliments from friends and strangers alike. Notably, it receives praise from both people who are highly experienced photographers and those who have done little beyond cellphone \"selfies\". The former (at least some of them) instantly recognize it and ask to take some test photos to see how it performs. The latter simply think it's a really sexy-looking camera. I'm more with the latter group. I frankly can't pull off the amazing photographs that it has pulled in more capable hands, but it's just a darn gorgeous piece of hardware.It was a tough decision, choosing this camera over something a little more serious, like the mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras that are popping up lately. Harder so as the price certainly approaches those more serious devices and I wasn't sure if spending money on an intermediate step would be justified over simply using the cellphone and buying a more serious piece of equipment for whenever it was needed. I'd have to say that the purchase is completely justified. Even in my untrained hands, the photos are noticeably better than you can take with a cellphone camera. I'm barely getting the hang of the manual mode settings, but I've got a long way to go before I can truly bring out the camera's potential. And it's got a lot of potential. I've had some very capable photographers take some amazing photos with this camera, and I personally can't see much of a difference between this and some lower-end DSLRs. So far, my best photos have been with various special modes/filters/effects on, but they are far from the quality that are produced when properly adjusting the various settings manually.With regards to the aforementioned settings, I frankly find them a bit confusing to use. There is a main dial that you can use to set aperture and shutter speed. All other settings (ISO, flash, stabilization, macro mode, etc) are through a menu system, and this menu system could use a bit of work. You'll get the hang of it eventually, but I just found it all a tiny but unintuitive. I'm assuming this goes back to some legacy camera layout, but I'm simply not experienced enough to know for sure. I'm a modern-age boy, and I like menu systems as flat as possible.Of course I must give the obligatory mention about the manual zoom lens, which, yes, also functions as the power switch. Many people have complained, but I frankly don't see the big deal. In fact, I sort of like it. Yes, it is different than other cameras, but once you get the on/off motion down, it's highly satisfying to turn on the camera this way versus using a switch or button. About 5% of the time, it doesn't actually seem to turn on the camera; this was alarming at first, but I just rock the zoom ring behind the threshold \"on\" point and swing by again to get it to wake up. As far as I can tell, this is the only hiccup that either of us have experienced with the camera. It's annoying but relatively minor.

After using this camera sporadically for the past year and a half, I have found that while it indeed produces higher quality photos than my iPhone 4, looks good, and is easy to carry, it has major issues that make this camera not worth my money. Currently, the camera is not functioning. Here is a list of three main issues I have with the Fugifilm XF1:1. For the most part, when I turn on the camera, I get this message on the screen: \"Lens Control Error.\" According to the manual, this error message means that the moving parts of the camera is obstructed and thus requires me to turn on and off the camera. The problem is that nothing is obstructing the moving parts of camera and despite turning on and off the camera, the message usually does not go away. Occasionally, the message goes away and I can take photos, which takes me to problem 2.2. Since a month ago, the photos I take with this camera come out mostly white. I assume that somehow too much light is coming in. A logical person would try to adjust the white balance of the camera setup, which leads me to problem 3.3. There are four setup \"pages\" that you can scroll through and adjust. Inexplicably, I am unable to access the second setup \"page\" where the white balance (WB) shift, color, sharpness, and other options are. I imagine that if I could access that, then I could fix the excessive amount of light that's coming into the camera, but that setup \"page,\" as I have said before, is inaccessible.In sum, the Fugifilm XF1's issues make this camera an absolute waste of money.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT Camera!", "Author": "Thiago Gimenes", "ReviewID": "R3NTIHKMTRFY5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A powerful camera packed in a small and lightweight enclosure.

I've never had any Fujifilm cameras and yet Fujifilm has been on the market for a very long time and they do produce top quality cameras. Three days ago, I decided to buy a digital camera, something small and compact that can fit my pocket wherever I go, something that's convenient to do selfies (lol). Here it is, the Fujifilm XF1.There are a lot of things I love about this camera. First is that its a digital point and shoot camera that has a dial where you can set it to Manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and Program Auto. Now, you really don't have full manual control on most point and shoot cameras, but this, this is something different. This is something what a photographer enthusiast will love. You're able to adjust the shutter, aperture and ISO. That's a plus! It also has custom settings (you can see it on the dial that says C1, C2). You can set up TWO custom settings which is a nice feature of prosumer models such as the Canon 7D. That's something you don't have in most SLRs (like the Canonrebel series). One thing that's unique about this lens is the switch. There's no on/off button but, to turn it on, you must twist the lens, pull it and twist it again. Sounds complicated? Not really, but since you're able to twist the lens, this means that it features a manual zoom. The lens is a Fujinon 25-100mm/or 4.0x optical zoom f/1.8-4.9. There's no automatic zoom here. So again, it's like a lens of an SLR. I just want to talk some more of this camera but then I won't go in to details since that would take me forever, but this is the camera if you want to learn the basics of photography (especially lighting) or improve on your composition skills. In my opinion, this is the camera for everyone - from beginners to enthusiasts to professionals. It's also a good pick if you have this HUGE ASS SLR that's aching your neck and hurting your back, and if you don't want to lug around that kind of camera, this is a very good alternative.

I also own a Canon Rebel (which I used for real photographic ventures like special events, concerts and travel) and a Sony Cyber-shot (which I had be using for more 'quickie' picture taking as it is smaller and I can fit it in my pocket).  Although I found the picture quality far superior with the Fujifilm XF1 than the Sony, the complexity of the Fujifilm along with the high price tag, make it seem like it should be comparable to what I paid for the Rebel. To be honest, the picture quality and the flexibility/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1. The way I look at it, the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot. If you are looking for a quality, sleek, stylish camera which is a step above the other pocket sized cameras (especially when it comes to low-light picture capability), and you have several $100 to spend, then the investment may be worth it for you. I just think that if you are a true photographer and want to take quality pictures in the $500 price range, then go for an entry level DSLR which will give you the flexibility of interchanging lenses.

There are several reminders on how to do this. Not as fast as pushing a power button, but you get used to it.1But this is what you want to know. This camera is supposed to have great low-light performance. And it does - if you don't use any zoom. Because any zoom reduces its performance noticeably, at least in medium-light conditions, such as a small bedroom lit by a 300W lamp. Any moving subjects will show motion blur, despite its fast autofocus.What else? The features are similar to that of the F800 EXR - separate-shot 3D, panorama, filters, etc., most of which you probably wouldn't use. Would have liked something like wifi transfer, but alas.Has full manual mode for more advanced users. Helpfully, there are customizable shortcut buttons for quick access to the many possible configurations.You can shoot high-speed video between 70-200 fps (at lower resolutions). This can be fun, no question about it.The display looks oddly low-res, however. Its 460,000 dots seem visible as fine, black diagonal lines.In short, as a point-and-shooter (who is not used to limited manual zoom) I would rather stick with the Sony or F800. More advanced users may have a better impression of the capabilities of this camera.UPDATE: Having fiddled with it further, I find it can take pretty good pictures of static objects in low light at max zoom, no question. The picture I'll upload of a labeled jar against a yellow background was taken in pretty low light.

The first one was a few pictures of my dog in the garden these pics came out incredible.  Than used the camera at a concert the zoom was horrible my camera a HTC EVO had better zoom.  The pictures turned out horrible and you could barely make out the singer on the stage note that the theater was pretty dark.  However I thought my camera pics were better.  Than I took the picture to the NFR rodeo with seats the same distance as the concert.  The areana was well lit same problem with zoom but the action shots turned out pretty good when you consider the bull is moving and the cowboy is falling off.  For pictures I would say the Fuji XF1 is best for close up shots with good natural lighting.Now for ease of use.  I tried all of the settings and not being much off a photographer I ended up using the automatic feature.  Could not tell much difference when using the camera I took the same shot with all the different settings.  Maybe to a pro these settings are useful but for me a bit of a burden.  Next turning on the camera is a pain you have to turn the lense and a few times I pulled it a bit to get the camera to turn on.  Zoom is also done by turning the lense so you need two hands to focus and hold the camera.  Flash is nice but you have to push the flash back down and I am afraid I will break it after a few times.I am sure this is a nice camera too someone who knows what they are doing and wants to control the length and the speed of the shutter to take perfect pictures.

The camera looks like should be 50 years old, has a very nice leather type covering that is very comfortable and lends quite a lot of grip to the body. Don't let the look fool you however, this is a thoroughly modern camera.One of the main features of the XF1 is the large 2/3 inch EXR CMOS sensor. This larger sensor gives you better quality pictures than the smaller sensors found in a lot of compact cameras, although not as good as some DSLR's which are coming with a 1 inch sensor (albeit DSLR's are really in a different category than compacts).  Other notable features of the XF1 are its 4x 25-100mm, f1.8 (at the 25mm wide-angle zoom setting) to f4.9 (at full 100mm telephoto) manual zoom lens (which can double to a 200mm equivalent digital zoom in certain modes), full 1080p movie recording, a high resolution 3 inch LCD screen and 7 frames per second burst shooting mode.The XF1 has a very full ISO range from 100-12800 (the higher ranges again only available in certain modes) and you can take your pick of shooting modes ranging from fully automatix (EXR) to fully manual with built in image stabilisation, a range of film simulation modes (vivid, soft focus, black and white, various colour highlights etc.), 120 degree upto a full 360 degree panorama shots, a built in electronic level gauge and fast processing and response times for shots.The camera itself is made from a very rigid and nice aluminium body which is mostly covered with a nice leather type covering which is very comfortable to hold and lends good grip to the camera.Something else that you shouldn't be fooled at is the XF1 is only 12 megapixels whereas a lot of new cameras are offering 16 megapixel plus. Even though the XF1 is only 12 megapixels, combined with the large 2/3 inch EXR CMOS sensor, the XF1 actually gives you truly excellent pictures. I compared pictures taken with this XF1 against compact digitals offering 14 and 16 megapixel outputs and the XF1 actually beats them on image quality even with the lower megapixel count.Surrounding the actual lens is a manual zoom ring with markings showing various zoom settings (and standby).  These are also mirrored in the LCD screen at the bottom when you zoom so that you don't really have a need to look at the markings on the zoom ring itself. When the camera is off the lens is stored almost within the body of the camera and locked into place. To switch the camera on you unlock the zoom lens by twisting it to the left and pulling it out to the Standby setting (note that the lens cover is still closed at this point). Another twist of the zoom lens powers on the camera ready for use.  If it sounds complicated, it really isn't and doesn't take long at all to get used to.The lens ring does allows you to quickly zoom the lens and set the focal length by turning it, with a short and tactile movement. This is an excellent feature and most welcome however here is also where I think the camera has one of its biggest shortfalls. To me this camera is crying out for a secondary ring to adjust focus. Whilst there is a full manual mode that allows you to manually adjust the focus, this isn't very well designed and has you fumbling with the scroll wheel on the back which you generally have to cycle multiple times to get the focus that you want. If there was a secondary ring on the front of the camera next to the lens zoom ring, this could be done is virtually no time at all.Manual focusing is activated by setting the Focus Mode menu option to Manual and using the rear thumb-wheel to set the focus point, with the LCD display automatically zooming in on the subject to help you judge the sharpness. It takes a lot of turns to move up and down the distance scale, not helped by the rather un-responsive thumb-wheel, which makes manual focusing with the XF1 much more of a chore than a pleasure.At the heart of the XF1 is a 12 megapixel 2/3-inch EXR CMOS sensor. This sensor is larger than those in most compact cameras and delivers better image quality, although not the equal of a DSLR. The XF1 gives you a huge range of choices in how you want to shoot from full 12 megapixel resolution in High Resolution (HR) mode to a 6 megapixel resolution in the Low Noise (SN) mode (mainly used for taking pictures without using the flash in low light conditions), or you can choose to use the Dynamic Range (DR) mode to achieve an optimal balance between shadows and highlights.The Fujifilm XF1's auto-focusing speed is very quick compared to other compact cameras. Generally you will find that the greater the zoom the more time it takes for the auto focus to work (this is more noticable on super zoom compacts) however the speed of the auto focus is more than enough to most people and I have yet to have a blurry image from the auto focus not being truly focused whether taking pictures on very bright sunny days to low levels of lighting indoors.  There is virtually no shutter lag on this camera and coupled with the high speed auto-focusing you shouldn't miss a shot and can fire off multiple shots rapidly.  If you opt to turn on RAW image recording however this slows down for example taking a 7 frame burst RAW + jpeg shot took the camera a few seconds to save the images off to the SD Card (I'm using a class 10 SD card for speed and I would recommend this as the minimum speed for this camera) during which time you cannot take any other pictures.On top of the XF1 are the tiny Fn button which by default provides quick access to the ISO speeds, but can be customised to suit your own needs from one of 10 different settings, a small but responsive shutter release button, a traditional shooting mode dial which is completely recessed within the top plate.The Fujifilm XF1 can record full high definition 1080p movies at 30fps with stereo sound and also several slow motion options at differing resolution going up to 200 frames per second but at a lowly 320 x 112 resolution. You can set the aperture and shutter speed before recording begins but once you start recording these are fixed and cannot be changed.  You can also set the Film Simulation mode, so black and white movies are possible.Pressing the E-Fn button on the back of the camera expands the number of external controls on the rear from 8 to 14 by assigning new functions to the top two buttons and the four positions on the control wheel.  These are programmable so that you can customize the functions to suit your own individual needs.The circular control wheel on the back is used to change the shutter speed and aperture and select other settings. Around this there are four options for setting the exposure compensation, flash mode, self-timer and focusing mode and in the middle is the Menu/OK button, which brings up a menu of settings that you can change.  You will find that some settings are dimmed and not available to you depending on which mode you have chosen to shoot in, these being controlled automatically by the camera itself.The FujiFilm XF1 is an excellent advanced compact camera giving you the option to have full manual control of everything, let the camera do everything and every step inbetween. This would be a great camera for those that think they may want a DSLR camera but are not too sure if it would be too complex or for budding photographers. The zoom on it isn't the greatest (some cameras allow up to 64x digital zoom nowadays) but the EXR CMOS sensor is superb and gives you excellent almost unrivalled image quality in a compact camera. There are a couple of shortcomings as noted above and I would dearly like to see a manual focus ring next to the lens zoom ring but overall it is very hard to find fault with this camera.Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Com'n Fuji you better than this !", "Author": "Aref", "ReviewID": "R37ZU81DURD7NT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I tried this camera few days ago in London at Jessops they have them for sale to be honest I didn't like the lag on this camera we are in 2012 and fuji still make camers that slow enough to make you change your mind , I might buy it on day just for how it look like but i will never ues it", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Price is obscene", "Author": "epact", "ReviewID": "R1FDZTXXFTOGV7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can't understand why the price of this is so high.
