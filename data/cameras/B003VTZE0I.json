{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera - Great Value", "Author": "VegasJack", "ReviewID": "R1ZN9ZPXSZUFMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good.... works better than advertised. Pictures are crystal clear, with the exception of a few caused by camera shake (me sneezing).. A very good product, would highly recommend it to friends. Kodak has a winner here. I purchased  the \"Blue Bundle\" (get more for less $$) and quite pleased with it so far.  I noticed a few reviews complaining of short battery life. I had the same problem, but found the fault was mine  for not fully charging the batteries the first time. Bought new batteries (same brand and type as what came with the camera), fully charged them, and presto, the battery drain rate was dramatically improved. Approximately 4 to 5 times longer than the first pair I managed to screw up. About 300 pictures before I had to give 'em a fresh shot of juice (electricity).A feature not mentioned in the ad is this camera does in fact have \"5x Digital Zoom\" in addition to the 3x optical zoom.I've had the camera just a few days, but have taken over 400 photos (mostly just junk shots learning about the camera and its settings) and have no complaints whatsoever. Camera seems to be very durable, body feels and looks like its made of metal/aluminum, it may be plastic, hard to tell as its so well constructed. Buttons are a tad small, but that turns out to be a plus, as with my other camera, I keep changing the settings as the buttons are \"To Easy\" to press. I like that the camera reverts back to the default \"Auto\" setting when turned off and back on again. Makes picture taking simple, just turn it on, point and shoot and get great shots with no fussing around with settings. The one issue, however minor, is when the batteries are removed or battery compartment is opened to remove memory card, you have to reset the clock. Not a big issue, just a minor annoyance. I'm retried, so I don't worry about time anyway..Also read a few complaints of poor picture quality with this model. The first few pictures I took were blurry and way out of focus. Problem was my fault (and may be that of others also) for not letting the camera focus. Press the button half way till the frame on the display turns green.... then snap and great pictures from there on out.. When problems arise, hit the Kodak web site, great resource for solving camera and picture problems.Setup is a snap, just plunk the batteries in (after they're charged of course), set the language, date and time.... point, shoot, and unlike a former Vice President, you won't miss that once in a lifetime perfect shot.... picture that is. Great camera for us older folks, who like me, don't quite yet grasp the digital age fully. Why I'd even recommend this to the ex-wife and her attorney.... for a small fee. (wink)Another  feature I like, is the built-in Help system. It describes every setting for every menu choice. If you learn nothing else about your camera, learn how to use the on-camera Help feature.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent, Easy to Use Camera", "Author": "BrandyHoward", "ReviewID": "R3CN6WDKRM1007", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the large photo size (12 Meg) ...Downside, It is very simple.

I am a little embarrassed to say the pics taken outside or in well lit indoor areas rival those of my $800 digital SLR. Flash pics also fine for subjects 6-8 feet away or closer, and surprisingly good macro shots. Has features normally associated with much higher priced point-and-shoots like in-camera editing, exposure bracketing, 3 frames/sec continuous shooting, face detection and switching between internal memory (32mb) and memory card - if card fills up, you can still get 7-8 shots by switching to internal memory. I like the fact that it takes AA batteries since they are easy to find in a fix. I can also use rechargeable AAs or lithium AAs, which seem to last forever. Nice bright screen and focuses well in moderately lit areas. Seems to be a sturdier build than previous Kodak entry level cameras (nowhere to go but up), and Easy Transfer system works well. Potential downsides for some users: 1-Can't hear sound on video playback until vids are transferred to computer (but vids are in AVI format, a plus for windows users). 2-If you're looking for high ISO low-light shots forget it...you won't get that from any camera within $100 of this price point. You can set the ISO to 1600 but you won't like the results. Forget the high ISO and use a tripod.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "BG", "ReviewID": "R2DCDBX63OG9L4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is definitely a great camera for the price.

I love the color. I had read other reviews and was skeptical, but I'm glad I bought it! The screen is a great size and very bright. There are so many different options for taking pictures, such as a firework option, self portrait option, and flower option, among others. I haven't even explored them all. If you don't want to deal with all of the options though, there is a smart capture button that just switches to what the camera thinks is best. I haven't played around with the Share button yet and actually don't really care to use it. The only problem that I would say that I have with this camera is that the zoom isn't very good. I wish that it had more digital zoom, because most of the time it doesn't have any. Another, smaller complaint that I have, is that the camera just doesn't feel well made. It's light which is nice, but it feels much more plastic-y than my old HP camera.To address complaints that others had, the battery life really isn't bad. Use rechargeable batteries, they obviously work the best. Also, for those saying there isn't enough space on the camera to hold pictures or that they get lost, use an SD card. $13 at Best Buy and you can save thousands of pictures.Overall, this is a great purchase for the price for anyone who just wants to snap day to day photos.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ease of operation", "Author": "R.

Of course it takes awhile to adjust to the buttons of any new device, but I learned the procedure very quickly. One tip, I went to the the kodak.com web-site and downloaded the software prior to recieving the camera and successfully installed it. When I hooked up the camera,,(through the included USB 2 cable) I let Windows install the drivers and then I went through the Kodak software configuration.

Has a small zoom, but she's mostly taking face pictures and group pics, so it's not a real issue.  There are a few things that make this a great little camera1) Great picture quality considering the price2) Uses AA batteries.  I have previously used Cannon's, and hate proprietary batteries.  You can't just \"buy a battery\" for one of those cameras if yours dies at an amusement park.  This uses common batteries. BIG TIME +++3) Simple controls4) Small enough to carry in your pocket.

I was very happy with the picture quality. Apart from that, the camera looks good, is easy to operate, has a nice clear \"preview\" screen and doesn't require any fancy software to upload pictures onto the computer. It does come with some fancy options (like direct upload to Facebook) but I'm not interested in those and cannot comment on how they work. I have not used the camera long enough to comment on battery consumption but you can always purchase a pair of Kodak rechargeable batteries with a re-charging unit for about $8 on Amazon.com. I'd also recommend buying a camera case (I bought a Kodak hardcover case specifically for this model for about $3 on Amazon.com which fits perfectly). Go here if you wish to buy the same: Kodak EVA Hard Camera Case (Compatible: C143, C183, C195, SPORT, M1093 IS, M340, M341, M380, M381, M522, M532, M552, M580, M590, M575, M550, M530, MINI, TOUCH). Also purchase an external memory card (SD card) for use with the camera.The only noticeable flaw in my camera is that it makes a small continuous clicking noise when it's on. But I'm okay with that as long as it doesn't affect its operation.Verdict: Buy if you are looking for a good quality point-and-shoot camera at a competitive price.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT BUY!", "Author": "DJ COOP", "ReviewID": "R15WFRMXEMKMS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a few point and shoot cameras in my day(double digits) and this is by far the best.

I was looking for a simple/basic camera for him that that is what this is.  Not surprisingly he has hardly used it, only a few times between christmas and now (May).  BUT, this past weekend we recharged the batteries since he wanted to take some pictures.  I was reinstalling them in the camera when a little piece snapped off of the bottom of the camera.  Now the battery door will not close & the camera is useless.  : (  We've tried duct taping the door shut but that will only last us so long.  So, this is a very cheaply made camera .  I would NOT recommend it and would not buy it again.  For a few more dollars you could get a much nicer camera with many more features.

My 1st digital camera that I bought 12 years ago was a Kodak. I am in real esate and use my digital camera everyday.  My previous low end priced Kodak lasted over two years (at least 10,000 pics) before it starting having some problem. That is two years of taking tons of pictures, being lugged around in and out of the car and back to the office.This one has problems from the start.  It is very slow to recyle to take a new picture (I have set on 3MP which is all I need for work).  You have to wait for the photo preview to go away to take another picture.  If you don't it will take a blank picture then you have to wait for that photo preview to go away to take another one.  The other big issue is the photo mode sensor.  Mine liked to think that everything was a close up shot.  Which looked perfectly fine on the camera display but the full size photo is very blurry.  You have to look at the icon the screen before taking a picture and wait for the flower icon to disappear or take several pics and hope that one comes out right.  Finally the battery door broke just enough not to stay closed anymore.  I was able to correct that problem with a tight rubberband.  I don't know if I got a dud or if this model line bad.  I have had too many good Kodaks to switch brands, but say to anyone to pass on buying this one model.
