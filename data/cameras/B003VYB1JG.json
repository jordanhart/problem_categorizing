{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Favorite 'pocket' camera", "Author": "Czechchick", "ReviewID": "R2N39XFQJB9O65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, I admitt that I was swayed by the touch screen and slide-cover, 12 megapixels, the FUJI name ( I own the S1800 slr, 18x zoom )and wanted a camera that would fit in my purse or pocket to always have on hand. It is so intuitive to use and the auto features help me, a non techy photographer ( although I am learning by leaps and bounds now)....great photos, easy uploading to the internet. It has become my FAV. OK, I love the metalic soft pink color too! I am blessed.I am thrilled to own this camera and paid more for it too.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "sue102250", "Author": "Sue Pearson", "ReviewID": "R25GP3FP2ECTYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE the camera.
