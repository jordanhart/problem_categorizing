{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Junk", "Author": "R. Matthew Goldey", "ReviewID": "R3Q6VXXQB29WFY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is marketed & sold under a number of different brands & labels. I saw them at Walgreens just yesterday with a different brand. It's junk. Pure junk. I picked one up at Hastings a few months ago. The software didn't work and the manufacturer does not have a website at all. I found an older version of the software on driverguide.com and was able to get that to work. However, within a few days, the camera ceased to operate.Just to quantify this review, I should mention that I've been using computers my whole life and have made it my career for the past 10 years. I know my way around software and operating systems. The software that comes with these cameras is garbage.Save your money.", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Exactly what you'd expect--Absolutely awful.", "Author": "M.L.", "ReviewID": "RMJTI87TWOOXN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sub-par, even taking in the fact that it's a fifteen-dollar VGA camera. The only feature that worked with any regularity was the webcam, as the custom (and difficult to install) software for the camera installs it as a regular Windows capture device, and uses a proprietary program to extract pictures taken. The modes were confusing, the pictures were always dark, and you never truly know if you've taken a picture (it beeps either way). I thought I'd use it to take pictures for Craigslist listings (and for those you don't need high quality), but the pictures weren't good enough for even that. As for the fact that it's a semi-useful webcam--well, better webcams can be had for the same price. Not recommended for anyone. Note: Very difficult to find the driver for Windows Vista, and camera software mostly does NOT work, even with the driver.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good toy", "Author": "D.
