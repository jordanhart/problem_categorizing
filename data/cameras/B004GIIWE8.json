{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worthless for HDTV antenna", "Author": "Paul R. Wickliffe", "ReviewID": "R6IL4GDSILJIZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this to boost the signal strength of my HDTV reception from an attic directional antenna to a Panasonic plasma HCTV.  I live 40 miles West of the transmission towers in the New York area.  Before I inserted the amp into the signal path, I did a survey of what channels I could receive and their signal strength.  I took the same survey after the amp was placed in the signal path.  With the amp in, I lost half my channels and lost signal strength in the remaining channels.  The threads on the type F coax connectors are not properly matched to my cable connectors, so only a couple of turns reached maximum tightness instead of being able to fully screw down the connectors.  I purchased this one because it had an FM trap on it as I am near an FM transmitter.  The trap improved performance, but it was still worse than just using the antenna by itself.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$32.40", "Features": null, "Name": "Philmore UHF/VHF/FM High Gain Distribution Amplifier w/ FM Trap : DA27B", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uAR8aWulL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004GIIWE8"}}
