I Recommend it a 100%", "Author": "JoHaNiTa Ta. \"JuanaKutch\"", "ReviewID": "R1JK5QTHMAHWT5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera since the beginning of May/2013. I think it is an AMAZING camera for all the features it offers and the quality of the pictures. I strongly believe that those who have said that this camera takes distorted pics, have gotten a defective one. My camera almost never takes bad pictures (unless I shook it or it has had the wrong settings). I love the WiFi connection (very easy to use and with several options, including cloud storage). The flipping screen, the beauty palette, the beauty shot, the low light shot, and the gesture shot are very cool and innovative features. The small and portable size, the color, the possibility to transfer those pictures to your smart phone to edit them better, or to just simply upload them directly to your Facebook account, send them to your email address, etc, make this camera my favorite over my other two. I have nothing bad to say about this little but amazingly built device. Look at the price: it isn't the cheapest camera, but it does give a lot for what it is worth, compared to other cameras out there that are sold for the same price or more... I really like it, enjoy using it, and my friends love it when I bring it to our events because out of all the cameras and smart phones used, mine always have taken the best pics!!", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Color is good.", "Author": "Cindy Xie", "ReviewID": "R3SWL0FZUHII8R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The color is good !
