Rewind to my son's 8th grade graduation in May. I didn't have a camera at the time so I was using my cell phone which ran out of batteries by the time the graduation procession started. I was devastated. FORTUNATELY a good friend whose son was also graduating was sitting right behind me and she had a gorgeous professional looking camera. She offered to take pics of our son for me. When she emailed them to me the next day, her pictures were amazing! The zoom, picture color and clarity was so unbelievable! I HAD to know what the name of her camera was. She said a \"Nikon Coolpix L810\". I quickly looked it up online and found it cheapest on Amazon. I ordered it on a Friday and got it on Monday! I'm in LOVE with this camera. I've been practicing taking photos with it outside my work during breaks and the pictures are just beautiful, the zoom is AMAZING. Now, it's definitely not a quick point and shoot camera. You should ABSOLUTELY read the focus instructions VERY carefully before you use this otherwise your pictures come out blurry. BUT that's not a camera issue, it's a \"you're not focusing the camera correctly\" issue. Lol. You need to press the button down only halfway to allow the camera to focus first, once the focus light turns green, THEN press it all the way down. Tricky at first but gets easy after about 5 pics. So take your time practicing with the focus and getting to know all its shooting modes and features before you try to use it for special occasions like graduations, weddings, vacations...etc. After you get used to it, you will be in love with it. The price for the quality of this camera is outstanding. Love the size of it too. Big enough to be taken seriously, but small enough to fit in a purse or bag for travel. Not heavy, but just enough weight to it to give that quality feel. It's perfect!Comes with: Strap, four AA batteries, USB cable, audio video cable, lens cap and software CD-ROM. Didn't come with a carrying case but no biggie, found one on ebay for about $6 w/free shipping (Ebay item #380422196943)", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love!", "Author": "Ziare", "ReviewID": "R2TZR5Z6ALCFPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was something that I was dying to get.  I've had a very old, 8 year old in fact, Coolpix camera that still works but it's so old that I hate using it.  The time in between taking one picture and the next if you need the flash is horrendous.  So I finally went on the search to revamp my camera owning.  And I found the Nikon Coolpix L810.I have to admit what I really wanted was something close enough to a professional photographers camera.  I take pictures everywhere I go.  Especially with my son.  I also don't buy photographer pictures, I tend to do them myself and they always turn out really well.  But I wanted a camera that could take that even further. When I read that this camera could take pictures that were professional grade I was pretty sold.  Not to mention that it came in colors.  I love color choices!  It just makes everything a little bit more fun.Upon recieving it, I read the manual and figured out how to use it.  It takes a little time to figure out exactly how to.  Because you don't just go clicking away like most cameras.  You hold the capture button half way down.  There is a small square on the screen that will turn green when your camera is properly focused.  That is when you press the capture button down completely to capture a picture that is not blurred.  You can 'snap snap' but sometimes you will get blurry pictures because the camera takes pictures so fast if you don't focus you will get blur.It doesn't have any problems with the lens cap.  If you forget to take it off a message on the screen informs you to turn off your camera, take the lens cap off, and try again.  Which was nice because I have  heard of people ruining their motor because they left their lens cap on.  There are two places to zoom on the camera depending on how you hold it.  On the top and on the side, which is really handy.  It does take video though I haven't tried that yet.I was also worried about the size of the pictures.  How much room they would take up on a memory card.  I bought a 16GB card and haven't had to stop taking pictures yet.  In fact, I went to the zoo took over 80 pictures and still only came to 300mb.  So I am extremely pleased with that as well.  I have already recommended it to a friend that is interested in a nicer camera.Definatly worth the purchase.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "i love this camera", "Author": "jen", "ReviewID": "R70TPQYX3YQ5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay first of all i love the 26x zoom and second i love the 16.1 mp.

And for those of you that think somethings wrong with the camera just spend some time using all the different scenes and adjustment's this camera has. one more thing i really liked was the ability to just push the video button to record video instead of having to change modes...and it doesn't matter what size sd card you have it will only record 29 min at a time, you can record multiple 29 min video's.... take it as you will.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it with my add-ons", "Author": "KB16", "ReviewID": "RABIT3BQ857FM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very happy to see this camera finally come out.

The application that comes with the camera let you view the pictures with great clarity.

It will turn on, but won't take any pictures, giving me the error message \"please remove lens cap\" even though the lens cap is off. then the lens makes weird noises, like it is trying very hard to come out, but can't.  I googled the problem, and I can see I'm not the only one that has this issue with the camera.  Not even quite 2 years old, so I'm disappointed.  I am going to try to see what a camera shop would charge to fix it, but I'm betting it will wind up being as expensive as the camera cost.Original Post:This is a fantastic camera for the money if you take a lot of stills.  If you take a lot of actions shots, like kids in sports, etc.....don't get it.  It's focus time and shutter speed are just too slow for action.  Some of the other reviews saying all the pictures turned out blurry make me suspect they did not download the CD that came with it titled \"Reference Manual\".  If you read through it, and practice for a few days adjusting ISO and white balance, you'll get fantastic photos.  The physical paper manual in the box is really just a quick overview, and doesn't provide much help, but the downloadable manual really does.  This is indeed a point & shoot camera, but a little fancier, so you will have to spend some time with it.  Don't order this and expect to pull it out of the box and go on a trip the next day with it.  You'll be disappointed.  I've had it a few days now, and I still have lots more to learn.  It is very comfortable to hold, great grip, and great screen on the back.  I'll post an update after I've used it a bit, too.****Update 11-27-12******After using this a lot more, I have actually gotten really good action shots now too.  It just takes some time to get used to and practice with.

I filmed at my daughters graduation and 90% of the video is out of focus.

This is light, easy to hold, the controls are so much easier than my older Coolpix, and the shots are just great. I've had a great time playing with it.

I reccomend that you play with the scene selections.  The \"obvious\" choice may not be the best choice.  For example, I got the best results taking pictures of flowers with the food setting.  The sport setting is good for general picts.  The portrait setting is good if you want a softened look to your subject matter.  I have not had the best of luck with the landscape setting.  I was able to get some rather good picts of the full moon using a tripod and the night landscape setting.  Better moon picts from auto and color select black and white.  Was able to get picts of my son kicking a football, and it did \"stop\" the ball mid air using the sports setting.  The burst mode in the sports setting is adequate.  I do reccommend using a class 10 memory card, though.  Write time even with a class six was annoyingly slow.I will say that my outdated Fuji S700 was more fun to use since I could utilize shutter priority and aperature priority.  I really enjoy the effects of tinkering with speed and depth in pictures.

Right after saying goodbye to the D-7000, I got an ad in the mail for a bunch of Nikon cameras and sat down and did some reviews on some of them. The L-810 looked interesting, tho it had only been out a few months, it nearly matched the D-7000 in mega pixels, 16.1 vs 16.2! I read the available reviews on it and was pleased to see that the vast majority of buyers were very pleased with it, only the people who got a dud camera didn't like it. After buying it and learning how to use it,(easy),I found out it was the best camera I've ever used, and liked it SO MUCH, I bought 2 more for 2 brothers and talked a third into buying one. Nikon and Amazon should be happy with our family as all 4 of us have the same camera and I'm happy to report we were able to get EXCELLENT pictures of the moon for the first time ever. I'm not a pro photographer but I have been on local NBC TV 41 times in a 3 1/2 year period with the \"weather picture of the day\" so I'm not a novice either. I do believe some of the reviewers who said pro photographers were jealous of some pics from this L-810, if you are serious about picture taking without having a Phd., get one of these cameras, learn how to use it and you can't go wrong, whether you get it from Amazon or not. Try this camera in very low light conditions without a flash and you will be amazed!

Display can be hard to see in bright sun or glare.- This camera lacks many controls features of many cameras in same price range: External mode selector, direct aperture or shutter speed control, or manual focus.- Camera does not auto-detect its orientation and rotate the picture when you hold the camera in portrait position.Overall:This camera would disappoint any photographer they thought they'd be working with a real Nikon and not Nikon Lite. As a point-and-shoot camera, the L810 employs specialized technologies like face recognition, wink-activated shutter, and BSS (Best Shot Selection) to do the work of getting a decent exposure. These technologies give you a decent exposure, but sometimes with less than fine image quality.Many of those features are designed around the idea that people will be in most of your pictures. When it's in the EasyAuto mode, its go to settings are those of the Smart Portrait mode.  Although it doesn't rotate pictures based on the way you hold the camera, it will rotate the picture to align it with any face it detects.Other reviews have recommended reading the manual to get best use of this camera. I second that. For example It's not likely you'd notice that setting the ISO number in the Auto (NOT Easy Auto) mode turns off anti-shake feature. This will give you better image quality in lower light settings where you're using a tripod, but the only way you'd know about this, and other special modes, would be by reading the manual.One of the bits of advice you get from manual is to take another picture. This has worked for me. Most of the time if auto-focus has selected the wrong subject, trying another shot has produced better resultsWith batteries, this camera weighs in at just under a pound. After adding in a camera case and a spare set of batteries, its size and weight are more than I'm willing to carry with me every day.The L810 has individual buttons for each of the three modes: still shots, video, and viewing. They are easy to reach, but have enough separation to avoid hitting the wrong one. Despite some practice, I still don't have the hang of working the video button so that I'm recording when I want to be recording, and only then.Internal memory supports a decent amount of on-camera editing. For example, you can crop and resize pictures, but some testing I did showed that the camera reprocesses the new image to create it in a standard size. I don't know know much this reprocessing, done even for a simple crop, effects image quality, but I feel more comfortable doing this with desktop software.The L810 display shows you when the camera is operating in optical zoom range, and when it has switched to digital zoom. I've found it easy to work with. The optical/digital switching mechanism has an unusual feature: selecting a lower image resolution extends the range of the optical zoom.The L810's  telephoto performance and high megapixel rating extend the range of pictures you can show without having to point out and explain \"Right there is a bird that was .  .  .\"  But, as with every camera, the most important lens for taking good pictures is the one in your eye.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely pleased.", "Author": "Marie", "ReviewID": "R2SC6PCBKI3SQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is wonderful for the price.

I do not believe you could get a decent enlargement from a fully zoomed shot.I purchased this camera to replace my old CoolPix P5000 (10 MP). Granted the P5000 doesn't have nearly the zoom capability as the L810 but I think the picture quality is better on the old model.Prior to purchasing this camera, I suggest you take a series of shots from wide angle to full zoom and review the images on a good monitor at 1:1.

First off, bridge style camera was just a poor choice for me because if I have that size and weight I might as well lug around my dslr and bag, but I decided to stick it for the impressive zoom.I saw that the 4 and 5 star reviews far outweighed the other marks, so I figured that you can't make everyone happy and only read a few of them. After having it for quite some time and testing it a few times (too late unfortunately) I went back and read some more negative reviews and ALL of my complaints with this product are there.For indoor pictures in general you will likely want a different camera. Even at wide angle I get blurring from essentially any movement. The zoom has some distance to it, but lacks sufficient stabilization to utilize it's zoom range. Even when using my tripod in an indoor setting full length zoom wasn't crisp. It could be because as you go into telephoto range it simply WON'T LET YOU FOCUS AT ALL. The focusing is at a snail's pace, so it's not very competent for candids.Now I will give it a few good marks. It uses AA batteries and for some people that is preferred. I've become a huge fan of battery packs, but I decided that I could suck it up. Also, after being largely disappointed with the zoom, the primary reason for which I purchased this camera, I was surprised at the quality of some of the macro shots, EVEN in an indoor setting.If you're looking for range, this camera might be a viable solution for you if you plan to always use it outdoors and with a tripod on things that do not move whatsoever. Unfortunately it doesn't do any of the things that I had in mind when I bought it so perhaps I'm being a little harsh and it deserves a two stars instead of the one that I'm giving it.EDIT: I have now used this a bit outside and with lots of sun the picture quality is impressive. I still haven't taken well-lit outdoor action photos, or extended to max zoom with a tripod out in the sun, but I just wanted to reassure that this camera does have its perks, though still largely not what I, personally, was looking for.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "a giant step backwards...", "Author": "S.

I have been shooting digital exclusively since 2005 and have always been on the lookout for a personal camera with the features of a DSLR but with the smallness of a point-and-shoot.This camera isn't it.I cannot believe how disappointed I was with a Nikon product. The only thing I found to like about this camera was the fact it used AA batteries. Considering how it burns through them, this is probably a good thing...I would advise you to ALWAYS carry 4 or more spare batteries.A main part of portrait/fine arts photography is composition... which is nearly impossible for some of us without an eyepiece/viewfinder. Despite what they try to sell us, a view screen is not much good in outdoor light.The image was so shaky that the long telephoto feature is not of much value unless you're outside on a bright, sunny day and even then it might be advisable to lug along some sort of tripod.Unless you want to use a somewhat harsh flash unit on 98% if you're indoor shots, this is not the camera for you. Its indoor/low light capabilities are extremely poor.I have an older Nikon D7000 point-and-shoot that is vastly REMARKABLY, superior to this camera.In many ways our first reaction was that the L810 is like a quantum step BACKWARDS, reminding us of the earliest digital cameras and all of their many, many foibles.

The last two camera products I used were the Canon a560 and a Kodak c833. They both got the job done, but they were too easy to use, and I needed something more complex. So, as a family, we decided to buy this camera.  To start, I'd like to thank amazon for being so quick. We were expecting the camera in 5-8 days, but we got it in three days only. The packaging wasn't fancy, nor ugly. The contents were the camera(duh), avi output for the camera, free batteries(trial use only), usb cable to plug the camera into our computer, and a nice software dvd.  Now for the camera, all I can say is you get than what you pay for. The camera did come with unnecessary features, like 3D pictures, and excluded features like shutter speed control, but for $200, what do you expect?  The zoom is wonderful if your subject is still and your hands are still. The auto-focus not fast at all, so your subject should be still for at least 3 seconds to get a zoom photo.  The pictures without zoom are wonderful. The camera can detect faces very quickly, you have the option to control iso speed(up to 1600), and the flash is just perfect. I haven't tested much outdoor photography, so you can look at pictures on youtube maybe.  Now for the video. The video on 480P is normal, and to tell the truth, the 720P is stunning on the screen. It's nearly professional, spider-man looking video. On the computer, the video looks how it does on youtube(if unedited).The most annoying thing you can do during video is zoom. The noise it makes is just terrible. It sounds like a dying cat trying to screech. But the auto-focus does look nice.  Another thing that I don't like about this camera is the feel of it. It feels like a strong plastic bottle. It makes me disgusted, but it's just something you have to get over.  Last of the cons, there is no optical viewfinder. This is a huge factor of buying a camera, because I grew up using optical viewfinders, and not using one makes me more shaky while taking pictures, and makes me uncomfortablebut this is also just something else you have to get over  So, to sum it all up, this camera is worth the money you pay for it. It takes clear picture on full zoom if your willing to be patient, the video is exceptional, the auto picture is very, very nice, the manual photos are also very nice, and the camera is light. Overall, I would most definitely recommend this camera to a friend! Update on 10/06/2012: I've been getting into bird photography in the morning the past few days, and the photos are excellent! The average shutter speed was 1/30 with iso on 200, and the pictures were better than I'd expect. It's clear that the birds are birds and not trash, the pictures aren't blurry at all, and even for birds from 20-30 feet away, it seemed they were only 5 feet away! Another point for Nikon! Update on 10/10/2012: Because of my great experience with this camera at home, I decided to entrust it with a 3-day vacation to Sedona. I've never been more happy with a photo in my life! My hands are not of the most stable, but this camera handled my shaky hands amazingly at full zoom on small wildlife like nothing. I got pictures of Golfers 30-50 feet with the support of a circular bar and my hands, stunning professional-like photos of my parents and the family, very memorable photos of Tuzigoot and Slide Rock, and exceptional video quality(with the exception of the zoom while videotaping). This camera highly surpassed my expectations of it's use, and I can say I'd be very proud to use it in almost any situation.

While I realize this L810 is NOT a DSLR and will not perform like one, it's performance is still very disappointing. I think I've taken better pictures with $10 disposable film cameras.PROS:The clear shots were clear and crisp (but there weren't many of them). I DID manage to get some good action shots (but not many). The scene selection needs to be played with to get what you want.And it IS light.  And still photos are okay (if you aren't expecting great, consistent color).CONS:Rarely a crisp photo.  Even the well-focused photos had a lot of noise under most all options.  One of the biggest factors for me in deciding to return this camera was that the color is awful.  My blues aren't bright and my greens are mostly brown.  There is a lot of yellow coming through the pictures.  If I want to mess with a bunch of settings to fix this, I can keep messing with my D90 and get crisp, clear pictures with realistic color.  I would also agree with another reviewer who mentioned the camera's constant refocusing. You think you get it focused, you push the button the rest of the way down and abra-cadabra, it refocuses, resulting in blur.I really, really wanted to like this little camera enough to keep it. It does take decent stills (for its class) and the zoom is great. But I want crisp photos (even for just \"everyday\" pictures) and I really want the colors to be accurate.

I was excited to receive that practice one summer afternoon and immediately I opened it to find a \"professional-looking\" camera (previously I had a tiny coolpix that was becoming slow and blurring pictures).  I read the entire manual CD and handbook and learned a lot about the camera and its functions.

This occurs mostly when I zoom. I tried the zoom in bright areas, but it yielded the same results. I tried turning off auto focus and playing with the configuration, but still no change. Many close up shots were blurred out. When taking photos without zooming, photos would turn out fine. The biggest letdown is the video recording. I purchased the L810 because of its 26x zoom, but video capture is completely useless when zooming. Everything becomes unclear and you would have to zoom in and out to stabilize the auto focus.

I have fairly extensive experience with photography - mostly film.  Familiarizing myself with this Nikon (L810) and doing a fair number of shots encourages me.  It is obviously a 'consumer grade' item but performs very well.  It is quick to start - easy to learn and use,  fairly intuitive.  It shoots quickly and with very little lag.  The photos taken are of very good quality thus far.  Batteries (AA) are easily available.  With a 16 gig card it seems to have a large capacity even at the highest resolution set.  All the settings available seem to cover most situations without enduring a very high learning curve.  It kind of looks/feels like an SLR - but is small and light.  The lens works quite well and provides wonderful telephoto power.  The macro setting is very friendly and effective.  I've yet to find anything to complain about.  It is a VERY good value considering the low price and high performance.  I'd have liked to had geo catching but the provided software is an acceptable 'work-around' for that.  I've yet to use the video - but not a big requirement for me.  If its half the still performance I'll be satisfied.  It's a Nikon - not a Leica - but very-very good considering the price.  Only time will answer reliability concerns...  but while feeling a tad flimsy - not a big annoyance.  It feels good in the hand.  Small in size and nice light weight.  I'd strongly recommend it.  The only problem I anticipate is a confusion potential when inserting batteries as far as polarity.  There are no discernible makings to know which way to put them in unless you check the manual.  A small solve-able issue...  but a foolish over sight I thought.  A great value!!", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Nice Camera, although sometimes fustrating", "Author": "ConsumerAngel", "ReviewID": "R25730NLAKMSFB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the L810 August 2012 (about 1 year ago), so I've had quite a bit of time to try it out. This was my first upgrade camera from using  basic ~$100 Nikon models like the P60 and L28 (although my very first was a Kodak easy share).Pros:~I chose the camera in Blue. The color is rich and I haven't had any major issues with it chipping.~My cameras come with me everywhere, so it's been through a lot and is holding up pretty well. I have dropped it once (only about 3 months ago) and it only sustained a corner chip (that's all that is apparent). The performance of the camera has not been affected.~When the lighting is high, especially on sunny days, photos are stunning and crisp, especially macros (the type of photos I take most often).~This camera takes SD cards, so it was an easy upgrade (although later I purchased an SD with a higher class to improve recording on card speed).~You can fit quite a bit in the shot when lense is fully zoomed out.~ (might be a con for some people)Although it isn't a DLSR, it kind of looks like one.Some people have even asked me which Nikon DLSR it was! It's my dream to own a DLSR, but I don't have the money for that yet (college is expensive). This camera feels similar to a DLSR when you hold it (as close to the dream as I can get, for now).Neutral:*Because the lense is a little too big for the camera, sometimes wider shots will have curve distortions in the corners. It's not significant enough to bother me, and I have actually used this defect to take some awesome, creative perspective shots.*Manual setting: The manual light/exposure setting is OK. The camera can be finicky.*Setting: Sometimes settings within the camera are sometimes difficult to find, such as formatting card. This is frustrating when I need to work quickly because my subjects don't always wait for me (organisms).*The lense has to be open/exposed too review pictures. I would have liked it if there was an option to \"close lense\" while reviewing pictures. My cheap $50 FujiFilm that I take along when fishing automatically closes its lense after you start reviewing images about 1 minute.*Darker lighting shots and extreme contrast lighting tend to be very warm. This can usually be fixed with software, but I've had instances where there was no hope.Negative:*Using the flash: Occasionally when I need the flash and pop it up (esp. for dark macro shots), the camera doesn't recognize this and I have to fight with the camera to accept the flash manually.*Lense is very easy to destroy. Only a month after owning this camera, there was already dust under the lense. I always keep the cap on, and I never exposed my lense to extreme wind or beach conditions. The dust is not visible in most shots, but I know it is there. At certain zoom levels, one of the dust specs create a blurry spot. I am pretty sure that Nikon would fix this problem if I sent the camera in, but it's probably expensive. I never looked into it, though(and I dislike paying shipping).*Dark lighting; This was my BIGGEST disappointment from this camera. It's horrible for low-light situations. My friend's cell phone camera was getting better quality low-light photos than me. Whenever I want a low-light shot, such as a picture of a moth at night, I have to wear a head light and hold a flashlight in my left hand while trying to take a picture. When I use the flash, it only works for objects close-mid distance away. Very close objects get super-exposed, and father objects are non-existent. Also, as the lighting gets darker, the fuzzies get harsher. I know, this isn't a pro-camera. But I would have liked it to handle low light a little better for the price.*Energy monster: The camera takes (4) AA batteries. No battery packs here. This thing is a battery monster that's ALWAYS hungry. I have rechargeable AA batteries for it now, but not always. Before investing in rechargables, it was a bad situation.*Focus: Like I said, I love taking macros/ close-ups. Sometimes the focus takes way too long, and very often it's challenging to get the right focus. For example, I want to get a close-up of a dragonfly. The camera will focus the face or the body, but not both. Whatever it doesn't focus is very blurry. I want a crisp, all-focus closeup. That might be asking too much for a camera like this, but I really don't know. I don't have enough experience to make such a judgement.*Speed: The camera is much faster than my previous, but still too slow for quick, action shots like animals running. These shots tend to be clearer the more you zoom out, but sometimes I want detail. I tend to get these shots indirectly. I take a video of the action, then use editing software (like Picasa) to extract photos from the video. These \"photos\" are not as crisp as a regular picture, but they allow me to capture things like lightning. There is a super-fast continuous mode that puts 16 photos on one frame. You can extract individual photos from this frame later, but they have to be blown up, and that sacrifices clarity.So, the L810 gets 4 stars overall because it is a nice improvement/upgrade from cheaper cameras. I do like it, but it can be frustrating when I can not capture the shots that I envision. Plus, it's dark-lighting shots are simply awful.You might have more experience with cameras than me and could probably make better judgements of my complications. Or you might have less experience and feel a little overwhelmed by all the reviews for all the cameras you are looking at.No matter who you are, the ultimate decider is YOU.

It's a nice package.Cons...I bought this camera for taking to car racing events, car shows and places where a good zoom for a nice movie is a MUST HAVE. I used the camera for some test shots, learning the ins and outs of it and was pretty pleased with it, until I started using the 26X zoom in VIDEO mode. It worked fine, but the shake AND blur that occurs during the zooming while taking a video was technically WAY behind the times as far as I am concerned & makes for a bad video.I have seen several other digital cameras in this price range & altho this might be one of those \"you get what you pay for\" scenarios, I believe the Canon models have cornered the market on blur reduction. Shop them all, but I ended up spending $400 instead of $225 and getting a camera that fit ALL my desires, not just most of them. My hubby has the old Canon SX5is and when I played around with his, I found that there were no zoom blur issues....I went to You Tube & found many videos that confirm the steadiness the SX50's blur reduction, keeping the subject in focus with very little shakiness.

It is not exactly a point-and-shoot camera, and I think that's something that prospective buyers should know for sure.

You have to spend some time with it to get comfortable using the different settings.  Using the camera in \"easy auto\" mode is probably the best for someone looking for point-and-shoot capabilities, but if you want this camera to produce the best pictures it can, you definitely have to play around with the settings and everything to find what works in which situations.  But really, it is an excellent camera for the price (much cheaper from Amazon than from Walmart or Best Buy, or anywhere else you may find it).  The battery life is pretty excellent.

What I discovered when I purchased the CoolPix L810 (Spring 2013) is that besides 16.1 mp, I got a camera with awesome glass! I'm not always a fan of point and shoot, but my budget at the time didn't allow for a more serious camera- but the lens on this camera is great.  The advanced features of auto focus and scene selection (everything a point and shoot can do) makes for one heck of a great camera. Plus the impressive HD video has me budgeting for a second L810 camera for videoing my son's band on stage from two vantage points. The lens quality on this camera convinced me to choose Nikon for a more serious camera (D3100, Summer 2013).  Be aware that as with all CCD sensors, if there is a bright light source in the field of view while videoing, the light will bleed on the sensor itself, causing a light line from top to bottom (CMOS sensors like my D3100 don't do this). The trick is, don't have bright light sources in the field of view while videoing- however with band's on stage- the effect is acceptable and appropriate.  When photographing, the batteries seem to last months. When videoing, you can get about 8 to 10 hours of robust charge.  So if you want the best bang for the buck for megapixels, automation and beautiful sharp images and your budget is 200 to 250... get this particular CoolPix camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review for the Nokia Coolpix L810", "Author": "alida", "ReviewID": "RJE2U0LG9EH4V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera on Amazon.

My camera may be defective because so many things are wrong with it.  I noticed right away that it won't take 1024x768 (1M) photos.

Side zoom, dedicated record button are all great pluses for it, and opening up the side panel, there it was, mini HDMI that can spit out your 3D photos onto a capable device. Wow!Design and Case:Nikon made it look like a DSLR, as many cameras in this class do to be able to have a large zoom and bigger, well, everything including the screen, flash, microphones, and even four batteries in the hand-hold. The blue glossy plastic looks great and can hold up to scratches relatively well. Buttons are well placed, although there is one to let the flash up, meaning you better remember to release it on a dark shot, because it doesn't automatically. Lens cap is basic, you might have to finagle to get it on. The hand hold is rubberish, very nice to your hand and your shot.Tech:You can choose the type of batteries you put in in setting for better efficiency. Zoom in two places is a little overkill for me, but some may like it. Stereo mikes really don't make to much of a difference considering they are an inch from each other. Buttons are basic, you will recognize the symbols from your first digital camera. Screen is great quality with what looks like a high ppi, size is just right.Shooting:Simple as ever if you want to take a picture, no settings, no filters, auto everything. It's called auto mode, and it's for the people who just don't care and want a good quality pic. But oh you can do so much more! Straight up modes also include portrait (recognizing faces), scene (I'll get into that later), and easy auto, where it picks a scene for you.Scenes:Very good ones to pick from, most have special things about them such as; in sports mode, it takes three, food mode you change the tint. Panorama assist is dreary along with it's brother, 3D. On both, when you take a picture, it shows the out line of the edge of it that you have to line up with your surrounds, which isn't as easy as it sounds.UI and Settings:Hit that little menu button and it will take you to different settings depending on the mode you were in. Some are obvious, white balance, megapixel count, ISO, filters, and how many shots to take on a click. But that's just the shooting menu. When you cruise onto movie menu from the side, again, even easier than shooting. Go to set up and you open a big can of worms. Anything you possible want to change about the camera is found on three pages of options. Those intimidated by technology are warned to leave them be. Those who like cameras, dive on in. I recommend going over every setting and figuring out what it does, so in the future you know. Things like Eye-Fi upload, vibration reduction, and motion detection are wonderful.Overall the UI is straightforward as long as you know what it all means, as navigation is easy.Recommend for anybody", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "Leahpeah", "ReviewID": "R91W8THK9PN56", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This item takes a while to focus and some of the pics look outstanding on the LCD screen but once printed are blurry and fuzzy.

It wasn't until I was having issues that I found my complaints to be quite similar as those who also disliked this camera. First off, the quality of the indoor shots and outdoor night shots are surprisingly poor for a Nikon. The pictures were dark or very sensitive to your movement. The shutter speed is much slower than we expected in spite of our changing settings around and with the flash on, it seems like we were smiling ridiculously at this camera for an eternity before it snaps the shot. We had so many blinking people in our pics it was almost comical had it not been so frustrating. The \"anti-red eye\" feature that blinks that orangey light before snapping the shot seems to be slow working and flashes FOREVER like a warning beacon throwing everyone off because it actually makes you feel nervous! So we were lucky if no one blinked; I guess the goal there is that there are no red eyes because everyone in the pictures will have their eyes closed! Plus, what adds insult to injury, is the camera will snap the shot, then freeze the image with the clever little question, \"Did someone blink?\" to mock you over and over while forcing you to take the darn shot again. I have three children 10 years old and younger, I can assure Nikon that while this feature no doubt raises the level of technical intelligence of this camera over others, retakes of any sort do not bode well with the younger set, so we have a great number of would-be great pics had two of the three kids not blinked but refused to take it over. Sigh. Outside during the day, the pictures were nice and the camera responded well to the different scene adjustments; however, like the indoors, it is sensitive to your movement. If you move even slightly while shooting, the image blurs and like the indoors, it takes so long just to take a picture in the first place... We adjusted settings and \"scenes\" as suggested which helped somewhat, but it is still slow, and for action shots - forget it. By the time the camera snaps the photo, the subject in speedy action will have already gone thru customs and hopped a plane toChina. No joke. We took the camera sledding, and I attempted numerous times to get my kids coming downhill. I must have taken 50 pictures of an empty hill before I finally had to do an intervention with myself to just stop the insanity. We gave this Nikon every benefit of the doubt as we endured a Christmas snow trip, a Winter School Pageant, and Christmas Day together. Sadly, I have learned that I am, indeed, not smarter than this contraption from you-know-where, in spite of my reading the user guide cover to cover and having my sister who IS a professional photographer play around with it for me and show me a few tips. To no avail: even she said for the money, we could have bought something much more user-friendly with higher quality pics, so back in the box it went and we are thankful Amazon has such a great return policy. I am hoping to start feeling smarter again very soon when my Canon arrives. :0)", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "George Havel", "ReviewID": "R1HWH2DCCEV032", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my review for the Nikon Coolpix L810 (red).

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good camera. If you are looking to upgrade and do not want the larger full size DSLR then this is and awesome choice. With the 16.1 MP and 26x zoom you can't go wrong. Oh yeah, and the second zoom toggle on the lens is a wonderful addition! I put the camera on a sandbag and zoomed in to take a pic of the moon... zoomed in all the way and the moon was so large it was outside of the viewing area. Now that was cool. And the photo was very clear too.I have found one issue since I have been using it; the timer is set at 10 seconds and you have to keep turning it on if you want to take multiple pics in a row. Meaning, turn on timer...snap pic...turn on timer...snap pic. I would have also liked to see a 2 second timer choice. Maybe we could get a software update for this, Nikon?All in all though, I like the Coolpix L810. It may grow on me a bit more the more often I use it.

Turning on the flash will make the pictures appear more to a white tinge.There are two automatic modes: auto mode and easy auto mode.  I'm not sure why people would need two.  There are settings for all sorts of different conditions like landscape (with panorama stitching mode), portrait, close-up, snow, fireworks, museum, etc.  I haven't tried all of them yet but judging from the quality of the pictures I've seen, I expect them to be outstanding too.The camera takes high quality 720p movies.  The only problem that I've found is that the file size becomes very large.  During playback, the sound and video become out of sync after several minutes.  Again, I think this is a problem with the QuickTime movie format rather than the camera.  I wish it had a feature to save movies in MPEG-3 or -4 formats.One of the things that has amazed me is that how long the battery life is for the camera.  It takes four AAs but lasts more than my earlier digital camera.  In my older camera, I would need to replace the two AA batteries after taking 50 pictures.  I've taken more than 100 with the new camera so far and the power level is still above 75%.Another nice feature is that the camera will show a warning message if you attempt to turn it on with the lens cap still in place.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera alternative to DSLR", "Author": "WDG", "ReviewID": "R3HJRDMZKIHHXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I  was wanting to upgrade my camera from my puny point and shoots that were overpriced and not that good.

It was VERY hard to get any pictures of our pet dogs in focus because they constantly move, and the camera keeps trying to refocus. You can do it by aiming your camera at a stationary object and depressing the shutter button half way and HOLD it there. This sets the focus and exposure and holds it as long as you hold the shutter button. Then while holding the button half way, pan the camera over to the picture you want to take, and depress the button the rest of the way. Of curse you need to select a stable object with similar lighting and distance for this to work.I think the problem is worse when zooming in tight with the telephoto. Camera shake and subject movement is more pronounced affecting the autofocus software. I had better luck with an older Fuji 12 megapixel point and shoot with my dogs:(The color and skin tones come out well UNLESS you use the flash as supplemental light. Now you've got a white balance problem because the color temperature of the flash and the room light will be different. This will be a problem with any camera shooting jpeg; you can fix it with post processing if your camera shoots raw mode.

I have to warn you though if you are hoping for a small compact this is not for you, but if you get a  small compact you wont have the zoom, in most cases.  The Coolpix L810 has great zoom and good resolution, but obviously that is just a stat thrown out by makers, the limiting factor in image quality is the sensor. I'll start off with throwing out a few cons.as with most cameras at that price range, it struggles with higher ISO -- so low light photographyIt has a decent flash attachment so my previous con is not quite as large.It is a little slower than some cameras, but so are most of the \"crossovers\". It takes about 2.3 seconds for it to be ready to take photos so it is a little slower.  Again, this is also common among crossover cameras.One thing i'd like to point out is something not often taken into account.  It uses 4AA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery pack, which can be both good and bad.  AA weigh more than the battery packs causing the camera to weigh more, and AA tend not to last quite as long, but then AA are ten times more easy to come by. All those things are me just being completely nit-picky.  You can't expect a budget, semi-compact, camera the rival photo quality of say, a DSLR. That said, it has great zoom as well as being quite capable at macro photography.

Well, if you read the instruction book, there is a setting that will have the camera flash with every photo (as fill-in, or for dark locations).  Additionally, some comments were made that the camera doesn't focus well and they get fuzzy photos.  This is not the case if you wait-perhaps a second or two-until the green box appears.  Now I will admit that I do not take sports photos, so waiting a second or two for me is not a problem.  I agree with those reviewers who reiterate that you MUST read the instruction book.  This is not a point and shoot camera.  This camera is more for someone who likes to use different settings for different effects.

Salzman", "ReviewID": "R1TJWKOM4W153A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When the camera arrived we noticed that the photos had random blurry areas, almost in a halo around the point of focus. We shipped the camera to Nikon and they had it for over a month. When we finally got it back, the blurriness was gone but all of our photos had a pink tint. We tried adjusting every setting on the camera to no avail. So, we shipped the camera back to Nikon yet again. This time they had it for over two months. When I contacted them to see what the status was, about 30 days into the repair, they told me it was on a \"parts hold\". Finally got the camera back with a laundry list of what had been done to \"fix\" the problem. However, all the pictures still looked pink. We sent it back to them three separate times for the pink issue. FINALLY, 6 months after buying the camera, the pink issue was resolved. In its place... a fuzzy black line straight down the center of every picture. Sent it back to Nikon AGAIN and now they have lost our camera and are putting the responsibility on us to prove it, even though it was their UPS ship label I used to send it back. Each time, to get the camera \"repaired\", and I use that term loosely, I had to first submit a support request on their website, after which I would receive a response within a few days. I couldn't respond back to the email but instead had to log back in to their website to \"add to my question\". They would provide a link to download a UPS label to ship the camera back. It took 2-4 days each time for them to acknowledge that they received the camera. There were never any updates regarding the status of the repair, when we could expect to get the camera back, or any other communication on their part. I tried contacting them by phone and requesting to speak to someone higher up the food chain and never really got anywhere. Singularly the worst customer service experience I have EVER had.

Took two pix and the camera stopped working, said batteries were dead.  Lens was out 1/2 way and lights went out.  I didn't have batteries with, as the ones in the camera weren't that old.  Fortunately I had my iPhone so I was able to get a few family pix.When I returned home I replaced the batteries with new ones but it wouldn't work.Took the camera back to where I bought it.  Service guy looked it over, said there obviously was no damage to the camera and sent it in to be fixed on Jan 20, 2013.  I got it back a week later. I opened it, put everything back on and tried it.  Worked great!  Put it back in the camera bag.Today, one week later, I took the camera out of the bag to take a pic of the dog covered in snow.  I was in the house so the camera was not cold.  Batteries were dead again.  I put brand new ones in and it wouldn't work - same as before, lens 1/2 out and lights go out.  I took the batteries out and checked them and they are fine.  Batteries are in correctly, because it did the same thing it did before - the lens came out 1/2 way and the light died.Based on other negative reviews I would say DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!

Need I say that when recording video the zoom and focus motor noises are loudly audible in the video?

I could have purchased a cheap replacement battery on Amazon, but I couldn't find a replacement battery in the Vegas area, so I decided to purchase a new camera. The old camera I had was very simple and only had a digital zoom, which doesn't compare with the optical zoom of this camera. I looked around and found this Nikon on sale at the Best Buy in Las Vegas and purchased it immediately. I was taking a day trip to Lake Mead and picked up the Nikon on the way there. I took a lot of pictures and a few videos and, for the most part, they look great! I only read the very basics of use, ie; battery install, zoom and how to take a video/picture, so I didn't get all the pictures properly focused, but the vast majority look great. Part of me wishes they included an internal rechargeable battery with this camera, but after facing the sudden death of a camera that relied on those internal batteries, I think I prefer having a camera with batteries that can be purchased most anywhere I go. Those internal rechargeable batteries seem to be made specifically for each camera you purchase so finding a replacement immediately available is fairly unlikely. For the price, I don't think you're going to find a better camera.

I can walk to one end, zoom in the camera all the way, and the other bridge will take up the screen on the camera, so it's got super zoom!

One of the settings allows for a picture to be \"3D.\"  I thought that was kind of cool; however, it doesn't work.  You have to take a picture of something, then slightly move the camera to the right and take a second picture.  This is supposed to give a 3D effect to the object.  Every time I tried this feature, a message appeared that said, \"Failed to take second picture.\"  Out of the dozens of times I tried, I \"accidentally\" managed to take a 3D picture.  I say accidentally because I have no idea how the 2 successful pictures differed from the other attempts.  In viewing the picture, I didn't find that the object looked 3D like I would expect.  It just appeared to have slightly different lighting.The other thing that bothers me is that this camera cannot take sequential pictures (snap, snap, snap, snap.)  It does take video, which I like, so maybe the manufacturer felt that was enough, but I would still like to have the ability for quick picture taking.One other thing to mention is that the media storage card is located within the battery compartment.  I am hoping that frequent accessing of this compartment does not end up breaking the cover.  It doesn't seem all that well built, but I suppose time will tell.  I bought the extra warranty for this item, so at least I have back up.Other than those things, I have gotten some great pictures and I do like the camera.

First I'd like to say that the L810 takes really good pictures and I love the 26x Zoom even though that kind of zoom won't be used a lot in my case but its good to have it just in case.  At first when I was looking for a new camera I was attracted to the Nikon Coolpix L610 for the 1080P video recording compared to the L810's 720P video recording but after doing further research I found that the L810 was an overall better camera so I was willing to compromise on HD video quality.  The things that are key to me are the camera's size (I don't want a small camera) and how it fits in my hands when using it and I'm glad to say that the L810 is just the right size for me and it fits comfortably in my hands when I'm taking photos with it.  The biggest test for the Nikon Coolpix L810 was taking photos inside my room which has the worst lighting to take photos in especially without the flash open which my old Kodak didn't do very well in.  When I took photos in my room with my Kodak camera with the flash closed the photos would always be grainy but when I took a photo with the Nikon without the flash it came out smooth which is great because some photos I take are in my room and sometimes I try not to use the flash if I can.  I did notice however that the Nikon Coolpix L810 definitely isn't a camera to take very quick shots with but that isn't too much of a problem for me since the pictures I take aren't split second shots.  Overall I think the Nikon Coolpix L810 was the best choice for someone like me who does casual photography and wants to upgrade from an older camera.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING CAMERA!", "Author": "Jessica C.", "ReviewID": "R39H72WQNSWD9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated on the comparable but lesser priced competitor and after advice from a few \"professionals\" I chose to pay a little more and get the NIKON.

This is by far the nicest camera I have ever owned, and even though it is packed full of features, I found it fairly simple to use. The smart auto feature is great for point and shoot pictures. The 26X zoom is so powerful. I could zoom in enough to get a clear picture of a squirrel that I could barely see with my own eyes. The record video feature is great because there's not a dozen steps to get to it, just one button and boom, you are recording.

This camera is a great product to start with. it does not shoot in RAW but the image quality is just as great to work with.The learning curve is pretty low, which is a good thing, there are many preset features for different shooting situations, from all-purpose shots to sports to fireworks/night shots. As I mentioned the fireworks mode, it would be good for me to note on this particular setting the camera's shutter speed is at its max of 4 seconds. I make mention of this because I know some folks may want to try their hands at light painting. Four seconds is more than enough to get a word or 2 in and with enough practice and experience you will be creating perfect light painted images each time. It must also be noted that for optimum performance natural daylight is the best time to take photographs with this camera, the images are shot at its best, crisp and clear.What I like the most is the ability to get just the right amount DOF needed for commercial product photography. Once you have proper lighting and a tripod or anything that will keep your camera steady, most if not all your shots will be near perfect.For what it's worth, the 720p recording works fine. My only gripe with it, is that the autofocus does not work on items that are  within 1-5cm of the lens. I guess I may need to try a macro lens and see if it would make a difference. Other than that, for general video recording it works just fine.All in all, for it's price and size the COOLPIX L810 is worth the buy.

It takes nice pics and it even reminds you to remove the lens cap.If you use the auto mode the camera does all the work. Finally this bridge camera-A cross between a professional camera and a point and shoot.

However, I decided I wanted a camera with a lot more zoom since I was going on vacation with my dad who won't let anyone take his picture. I figured I could sneak pictures from a long ways away and he wouldn't even know it.Ironically, while my dad was here visiting and then going on the trip with us, he decided to buy this same camera but in blue.So after recieving the cameras my husb and I read the manual (skimmed thru it as best we could with limited time) and thought we could just turn it on and point and shoot since we programmed it for our needs. My dad did the same thing too and we exchanged thoughts and tips.We went on our trip less than a week later and every time I would take a picture if would be completely blurry. Like the shutter speed was lagging. Our 20 yr old son fixed it for us and seemed to be better sometimes but either grainy or blurry. Needless to say I just let our son carry it around the whole entire trip on the ship and islands so that we'd have some decent pics. He seemed to understand and be more patient with the settings and modes for the situation (indoors, outdoors, lighting, etc) - so that was all good but I hardly got any pictures of him and it was his 21st birthday trip we were on.My dad didn't use his camera one single time on the trip because it was \"way to big to carry around\".After a month or so after getting home I went ahead and listed and sold it and bought me an easy to use point and shoot camera again. MUCH happier with it but sadly, no great zoomage. Oh well, at least I have a good little camera now with a fast shutter speed.And as for my dad, he ended up giving his brand new blue one to my son (his grandson) for his 21st bday since my son seemed to love it so much. He still loves it btw and has had it since Sept 2012.If you are wondering the little great camera I ended up settling with is the: Samsung DV300F Dual View Smart Camera - Silver/Red (EC-DV300FBPRUS) which I bought right here on Amazon (of course!!).

It is very pretty.  Many compliments on the looks.  It is heavier than my other cameras so that was a little harder to get used too.  It does come with a neck strap, but after a while it starts to get uncomfortable, so I usually carry it with the strap wrapped around my wrist so I don't drop it.  So far, that has worked out well.Performance:  Takes great close up pictures.  Very clear and crisp.  I have the settings on maximum. (16MP 'Star', vivid color)  Not unhappy with that at all.  The 26X Zoom is a good feature too.  I am able to get 'closer' to the subject than my old 10x zoom Nikon.  Very easy to use, once you get used to it.  Many 'preset' options available.  Menu comes up quickly without a huge delay.  And, I have been able to take better shots than I have in the past (with my other cameras) so that is a big plus.  For a 'point and shoot' it is pretty good.Drawbacks that I have noticed so far: select a scene has a lot of different setting for a variety of situations, that is a good thing.  However, \"Indoor Party\" is not good.  I wish I would have used something else.  Lost some moments there that I will never get back.  Word of advice, practice with some of the other settings BEFORE that big event.  Also, it does not 'snap' pictures as quickly as I had hoped (although much faster than my other camera).  It has a setting for rapid sucession, BSS, which I like, but it just doesn't get it done quite up to my expectations.  Action shots have been blurry.  In all fairness though, I have not experimented with the sports setting in the select a scene section so that could be 'my bad'.Overall:  I like this camera.  It has a lot to offer.  Good solid performance for a Point and Shoot.  Affordable.  I suggest using rechargable batteries.  Carry spares.  It has a battery life icon but do not believe it.  It goes from showing a full charge to 'battery exhausted' in one picture.  I think with practice, one could really get some good shots out of this camera.  There are a lot of settings to experiment with, including white balance and ISO settings if you would like to get away from the manual presets.  If not, Smart scene and Select a scene has a lot of 'preset' options to choose from.All and all, though I am not thrilled, yet, I am not unhappy and I am really motivated to make this camera work for me.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "Franklin  E.

However, for an upcoming cruise I decided I wanted something with better megapixels, and better zoom options.  Because I was impressed with the quality of the L5100, I stuck with the brand name and bought the L810, receiving it on May 9, 2012.  My daily job doesn't require constant camera use, so it wasn't used much, just a picture here or there but I was VERY impressed with the quality of the images I was seeing, and the camera's ease of use.  I thought I had the perfect camera for my cruise, and I planned to better test it on a trip to Las Vegas in late June 2012.As a testament to the camera's power usage, the batteries that came with it lasted until 23 June (about a month and change from first power up).  Unfortunately I was at Hoover Dam (my first big scale test for the camera) when those batteries finally died.  Like any other good photographer, I carry spare batteries at all times.I put in a replacement set, and hit the power button.  The lens started its extraction process but then stopped, and then the camera shut off.  I'm thinking something simple (I double-pressed the power button by mistake, or maybe I hadn't closed the battery door fully so battery contact got lost).  I rechecked the batteries, they were fine.  Pushed the power button again, but now the power light comes on for about 5 seconds and then goes off.  There are no noises at all (no attempted motor noise for the lens, no clicks, nothing).  I also can't access any camera menus or see any indication on the screen within that short 5 second period.  The camera is simply dead, with the the lens locked in the external position so that I cannot even put the lens cap on to protect it.  I've looked for some sort of \"reset\" button on the camera that might drive the lens back to home position, cannot find one.  I even assumed I had a defective spare set of batteries, so I stopped by a convenience store for a new set on the way back to the hotel.  Still the same symptoms as before.Based on date of receipt, the camera is ONLY 45 days old, but 15 days beyond Amazon's return policy .  I'm also still in Vegas so I don't have the original box or cables with me (now I'm evening questioning if I kept the original box).  It appears I've lost the money I paid for this camera.  I'm also unsure how to safely transport it back home because of the exposed lens.  I was really optimistic about this particular camera.  Now I'm sitting in the hotel room in utter disappointment typing this review.  I have no way to capture pictures for the remainder of my trip,  and I don't have my camera for the cruise.  I'm also not sure if I want to spend the additional money to replace the same camera model (meaning I'd spend nearly $500 for one camera)...I highly recommend anyone buying this, get serious use of it everyday in the first 30 days.  If it goes defective, at least you'll be able to return it without a problem.  This almost feels like the \"Murphy's Law\" for purchases.

I have sent it in for repairs twice now(in 6 mos.)

Nikon service  sent it back to me explaining they could not find anything wrong with the camera and took \"hundreds\" of pictures without a problem. Evidently they were not trying to photograph a wiggly grandchild's first birthday, or possibly they don't care that the camera does not focus correctly--even when the lighting is good. Other reviewers have suggested playing with the cameras features to get good pics, but I disagree--it should work perfect right out of the box for the kind of money I shucked out for this thing.

This way it is easy to go from one to the other.Dislike.  The Camera seems slow to save to the memory card and I am fairly certain I have the higher speed card.  What is very bad is that if you try to take anothe image to quickly it seems to create a gap in a photo, with a whole row of pixels missing. The camera says please wait...but I think it should be much smarter and if it is not ready to take the next photo, do not let me.The other thing that really bugs me is not having a view finder.Taking all photos looking at the LCD like a smart phone is much harder than I thought, in bright light and it is hard to utilize the extreme zoom.  I know it is by design and I knew it when I bought it, but I thought I could live with it given the cheaper price, but regret not spending a little more and getting a camera with a view finder.There are 2 sliders to zoom the lense, one on the lense it self which I am guessing a left handed person would use more and the normal rotating thing right next to the shutter button.

The new batteries I put in lasted about 350+ pictures :-)  if the batteries are getting low the camera will have a harder time focusing or even zooming in, but anything with low batteries will most likely slow down, even your car.

Thought this might be a cheaper way to get the quality of a true DSLR, and I was mistaken. This picture was purchased to help capture the trip of a lifetime, and so many of my pictures returned slightly out of focus. I had read the manual, and was ready for the trip. On our trip we had so many missed pictures because I would hold down the capture button and sometimes it would take a few seconds to actually click  or not at all. Further more, whenever a photo was zoomed in the camera would refuse to focus properly at least 80% of the time. I know people said well you have to hold it halfway to focus and then click it, but it hardly ever held focus. I thought it may be a user error, but it seems that I'm not the only one who's ever had this problem with this camera. My husband tinkered with it quite a while and it was useless. A camera that can't hold a focus is ridiculous. We have so many perfectly framed pictures that just are as enjoyable because its fuzzy/grainy and slightly out of focus.
