Depending on the area I mainly use this camera or the smoke detector camera with fish eye. Both work very well in lit area's. Good price for what you get", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid and Great", "Author": "Henry H.

Equally as descrete, but not as advertised. The picture does not match the product delivered.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a Night Vision Camera", "Author": "Mike Martin", "ReviewID": "R1204UQ1ML0SXG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Product claimed to be a \"Low Light\" camera, but it will not work unless there is ample light. In a lighted area it works just fine, but turn off the switch and the screen goes black. I bought 4 of these particularly because of its claim to work in low light, so I am very disappointed with my purchase.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor picture quality and camera coverage", "Author": "snackdaddy", "ReviewID": "R2BDWQVJRLLRNT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I brought this product to be used in a garage as a extra hidden security camera. The picture quality is poor at best and the camera is angled at the ceiling. Ive had 10 other cameras that Ive installed from a different company and wanted to try this brand. Im going to get this junk out and go back with the same brand that ive been using. Dont buy this junk. Spend a few more dollars and get a better brand. It even looks odd compared to the other brand.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what I was expecting", "Author": "Paula", "ReviewID": "R3LU62QU7VJBZT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to return this...

It doesn't look like a smoke detector and is a dead give away to being a camera as a black cord comes right out of it to plug into the was outlet.  The cord is not long enough to reach very far and has to be plugged into the tv to watch what its recording.  What's the point right?!  Idk.
