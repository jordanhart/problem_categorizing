So the pictures look bad on the display itself. But once loaded on a computer pictures look fantastic. Having lost expensive cameras in the past I figured I give this one a shot without a big dent to the wallet if lost or broken. It doesnt have all the bells and whistles . So I end up with red eyes in some pictures no biggie with photoshop.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME FOR THE MONEY/FAST SHIP", "Author": "ME", "ReviewID": "R3J8RZHK6LT3GV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a video/camera quick, I am out of the country and left my \"good\" camera at home.The pictures are great, video (no audio) is awesome and clear, and easy transfer to pc, with the media software that comes with it, and cable and case.....ordered and was to me in 7 days, normally anything shipped to this part of the world is 3 weeks......Amazon is the greatest and this little camera is awesome!", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Big Disappointment", "Author": "Brandi", "ReviewID": "RRBVW11Y3XBGJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after reading all the great reviews. When I received the camera I was very disappointed. The camera is plastic, one drop and it's broken.  The picture quality is very grainy even when you transfer it to the computer.  And if you are not completely still for 3 seconds to take the picture it will be blurry.  The camera itself only holds 4 pictures before the memory is full so you WILL need to buy a memory chip for it.  If you want clear pictures don't purchase this camera.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "simple digital camera", "Author": "Sweetnative", "ReviewID": "R1ICT0E5HYSL5U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would say this camera is an alright product I think i was expecting a little more.Picture quality is a bit low as well as the video.Sucks up your batteries like crazy when the flash is in use.Its very light and easy 2 use.I like this camera I just don't love this camera!", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bough as a gift and I want one now", "Author": "Va.Geo \"geo5734\"", "ReviewID": "R2XH968A6C3BNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although this one was pink ( purchased as a gift) the Camera works great and takes high quality pics and vids.

Weisenbach", "ReviewID": "REAUFXWYMRTLH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I needed a simple camera that I could take pictures of my kids with. I wasn't able to spend much money and I thought this little camera would be adequate. It's not even close to adequate. To me, it's a bit complicated, flipping through the menus, configuring the settings, etc. But I figured it out, with some practice. The problem with the camera is the quality of the pictures it takes. Every picture I took came out fuzzy and distorted. It didn't matter if it was up close or far away, whether the object was moving or still. I had some issues with downloading the pictures as well. It comes with a USB cord to plug into the computer and camera. There is also a CD that installs the drivers for it. I never could get this to work correctly. Another problem is that the internal memory is extremely small. I set the camera settings to give me the best picture possible. With this, I could only take 11 pictures before the memory was full. I solved this by adding a memory disc into the slot on the camera. I would add the pictures to the disc and take the pictures from the disc itself via a memory card reader.I was very disappointed that this camera never lived up to my meager expectations. I wouldn't advise anyone to waste the money on this. If you don't mind the picture quality and can purchase a memory disc, I suppose it would be fine. I should have returned the camera, but I never did. It's put away in a cabinet and never used. I'm now in the process of searching for a new one.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Think twice", "Author": "Dabbott", "ReviewID": "RN7G2UZU2NJXP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is almost plastic and does not hold a charge on the batteries well.
