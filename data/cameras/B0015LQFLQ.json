I've had this camera for almost a year. The battery life is horrible. This camera doesn't have recargeable batteries, and a two brand new batteries will die out fast. I'll be taking a couple pictures, then ten minutes later, they die. If you leave the batteries in the camera when it's turned off, for some reason they're near dead when you turn it back on less than five minuites later. It can get costly after a while. Another problem is the \"face capture\". The person has to be looking directly at the camera or it won't pick their face. I do like the quality of the images I get, most of the time. You have to hold this camera still, the slightest movement makes the picture blurry. But, sometimes it gives me nice pictures when the camera feels like cooperating. 7 megapixels for this price isn't bad.OverallPros:-Good price-7 Megapixels-Takes great outdoor pictures-Records decent movies-Recorded movies compadible with iTunesCons:-Short battery life-Face capture requires the person to look directly at camera-Easy to blur pictures unintentionally-Recorded videos aren't compatible with Windows Movie Maker or Windows Media Player-Doesn't always capture detail", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "good pictures. Bad battery connection", "Author": "miss p", "ReviewID": "ROU1H79WW3HS0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this camera 1 week ago and like it very much. It takes sharper pictures than my 3 year old sony cybershot that has 5.1 megapixels. It zoomed well and downloaded like a charm. My only problem was the batteries. It kept telling me my new batteried needed replacing the first time I turned the camera on. After trying 3 sets and turning it on and off 6 times it connected. The next day the same thing and again today. Tonight no problem. I have no way of returning it because it was a gift. If anyone else has dealt with this I would love to know how to fix this.", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great...for 6 months", "Author": "Laura Mason \"Laurie\"", "ReviewID": "R1NF5KZJMB5ENZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I loved this camera!

Wagner", "ReviewID": "R1AA8I0LYSEUQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and was amazed at all the cool features it came with. It is great quality small but definatly cool. Mine didn't come with a card but a new card (1gb) only cost me 10$ or you can get a generic one for 8$ like the PNY card. This camera has so many features I'm still figiting with it heh scene types like indoors,outdoors,fireworks and alot more. Then it has a video camera function which is excellent and with 1 gb you can record up to 30 minutes with sound. This also has a panaramic feature where you take 3 pictures and combine them to make a panoramic picture right on the cameras view. It has a 3X optical zoom which is great and I think a 8X digital zoom. with 1gb card you can take about 300 HQ pictures pop them on your computer or at a retailer with card reader \"do it yourself\" picture machines or print right from your computer. I reccomend getting Digital camera batteries as with all digital camera features/lcd screen/and variations of flash drain normal batteries quickly. So I will grab some very good camera batteries from energizer. And this camera has a energy saver mode it does shut off after a bit and turn off lcd after a bit.

It had enough features to allow me to customize the view of the stop motion and my friends are all addicted to taking personal photos in panorama now.  One person was impressed that it stitches the panorama pictures together in the camera, but I don't know if that is unusual.  So far it's wonderful, but sometimes when you turn it on it will say the batteries are exhausted and then when you switch the two batteries with each other you hae full battery, its the only problem I've had, but it doesn't bother me considering how cheap it was and how ell it works.", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Low price for low quality", "Author": "BBC", "ReviewID": "RLLAD06AYX3FT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera specifically with an upcoming vacation in mind after my old digital camera broke. This camera takes low-quality photos --blurry with poor color. You get what you pay for, I guess. On my second day of vacation, the camera would not turn on. I replaced the batteries with no luck. I had to use a disposeable camera for the rest of the trip since my brand new, two-day old camera died. Needless to say, I returned the camera immediately upon my return. Props to Amazon for issuing a quick refund.I recommend spending a little more for a better quality camera.

Takes good video and good Pic ( good pics of you have the settings right, other wise kinda blurry )But the Video always comes out good and gets good sound, But the speakers are under the cam, So you have to watch were you hold it. OR you well cover the speakers and wont get any sound.The Flash is really good on here too. Iv taken pics in the dark and it makes it look like im in the day light.one thing i dont like is..I used to have this one camera and when ever i took a pic it saved the number of the pic, NOT the number of the time i took a pic. just the number on how many pics the camera as taken ever. So if i took 00001-00020 and then took the pics off of the card and into my comp and then took pics the next day it would start the save at 00021.BUTThis cam dose not save it like that. It saves the number by at the time you took it, So now when i take the pics off my card. i have to number them myself b4 saving them into a folderAnd of mine breaks like the other person he wrote a review. This ok i guess. For the price i cal order another one.

I was thinking maybe it was just this camera, because all the reviews I read seemed pretty good. Well, the second camera was worse then the first. It would not turn on and off at times, the lens didn't work all the time and the quality of the picture was horrible. I would not recommend this camera to anyone.

I had no complaints about any of the pictures I took.  They came out fine.  The Focus time was a little slow, but I wasn't in a hurry.  I did notice pretty quickly, however, how rapidly the battery life drained.  A normal major name brand battery (non-lithium) will last approximately 2 hours. The Lithium batteries last much longer. However, even with those, my camera has a terribly annoying habit of not recognizing the battery as being charged.  Sometimes I will turn it on and it will display a screen that tells me the battery needs to be replaced, even after putting in new ones. I'll have to push the power button repeatedly sometimes up to 5 times before it will recognize that there is actually power there.After about a year of use, not constant by any means, the wheel at the top of the camera that switches between modes has become loose and sometimes will freely rotate between automatic picture taking and picture review. and it hard to turn at other points.The Pictures themselves are fine. I really do enjoy the panorama feature, and the scene mode does make a difference in different lighting settings. But, it's getting to be time for a new, less frustrating camera, and I think I'll be shopping around.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera is useless in low light/Night, not much better in day", "Author": "Appleanche", "ReviewID": "R3LUT6VIIVDM92", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There are many great cameras in the same <$100 range. This is not one of them and should be avoided at all costs.Most any camera can take a half decent picture in good lighting/outdoors, and this one isn't an exception. It's clear, color seems dull, but overall acceptable pictures.The biggest test tends to be the low light/indoors and this thing is an absolute joke. You have to have flash on for it to even somewhat focus for some reason, any photo I turned flash off (IE, Timesquare) it was just a blur, flash on had better results but it just made the picture seem dark and dank when in reality i was a bright area.Indoors with low lighting is the same result, you can either use the bad flash or get blurs.There really aren't any settings that help this and by the end of the day my Motorola Droid's camera pictures tended to turn out better, which really tells you about the camera.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Batteries don't last - neither does camera", "Author": "Kathleen Sikora \"Sukey\"", "ReviewID": "R3U2PDJP87N5ST", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking for a basic digital camera and this camera was a big disappointment.

Even when I use the image stabilizer mode, the pictures come out bad. Oh, and the white out...the white out is terrible. I have dark skin and the flash makes me look as pale as can be. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. I paid 85 dollars for this and I got 85 dollars worth of camera. You want good quality photos, save up and get a better and inevitably more expensive camera.
