Only drawback is that, other than the spare battery and filters, the items included in the bundle are sub-standard.  The tripod and extra lenses are simply very cheaply made and useless to me.  My recommendation is to buy the camera body and the lenses you need then find good deals on Amazon for a good tripod, flash, etc.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Paul Buttermore", "ReviewID": "R3MRGPJ45ITSXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera!
