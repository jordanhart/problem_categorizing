I needed this camera for my trip to Germany in the fall, I have two other SONY Cameras the A77 and the A99 which are the full size DSLR's with two pieces of Carl Zeiss glass and lots of toys.  Since we will be in Europe for 21 days, weight became an issue.My full frame and full size SONY's with additional battery holders, and glass were just too big. Great cameras for what I do here in the states. 21 Days, one suitcase, I go light.  Besides I have an adapter that allows alpha lenses on the NEX size bodies.Trudging through castles and churches, Photokina and Octoberfest, I wanted small with interchangeable lenses, the whole kit  with the 12mm, 16mm, 18-55, 55-200 weighs less than one unit of the larger size. This type of trip is wide angle country.I have owned a camera store, a full house lab, and still the CEO of the  \"Black Box Company\". I was and still am at times been a professional photographer owning Nikon, Canon and Bronica systems for the past 50 years.  When I retired, finally, I became interested in SONY and retired all my other gear.  I had  a lot, it got me a new car.People are not aware SONY makes the chips and motherboards for the others mentioned and the results in tests we ran with the camera and optics especially in the wides with incredible low light and little or no distortion.  Color rendition showed no red or blue fringing, I noticed with other products, even pushing 20-30's in our lab from a sub 400.00 dollar camera.  So far we have been blown away by the results, fit and finish, but the pictures we processed and blew up were outstanding.One of the magazine writers commented about the viewfinder not being exact enough (pixel count) but I had no problems whatsoever.  If thats their main con, they had to look awful hard to find it. Most critics even in the magazines (ad buckets, we call them) shill for either Canon or Nikon and I ignore many of their comments.  50 years of handling repairs, none of the makers mentioned attained sainthood,  they all had their quirks and we did a robust repair business.This is an incredible price point camera that delivers, and four of us going to Germany already switched because of the weight situation.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Good and the Bad", "Author": "Rick Bennette \"Rick Bennette\"", "ReviewID": "R1GH84WPQVM5FG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I won't go into all the features because you can find that information elsewhere.Upon picking up the camera, the first thing I liked was the feel. It's the perfect sized travel camera for someone used to a bigger DSLR while having a comfortable, deep recessed, rubberized grip. The included 18-55 zoom feels mechanically solid for a kit lens, and it's also fairly sharp corner to corner. There's very little geometric distortion or chromatic aberration.Shooting stills in low light, the shots are amazingly clear with very little noise. In decent light or with flash, the photo quality is amazing for a 400 dollar camera. Pretty much in the top ten list in this price range. It's also quick to turn on and shoot the first shots. If you're buying this to shoot primarily stills, you'll be very happy. It's good enough and fast enough for anyone but a hard core pro. You'll have the usual gamut of full auto, full manual and many combinations in between.The first videos I shot were at night in a well lit downtown open air mall. What I observed through the view screen was stunning. The stabilizer isn't very good at damping out motion from walking, but it's fine for stabilizing shots while you're standing still. Looking at the well lit video shots on a computer at 1920x1080, I was impressed. The autofocus tracked accurately and silently, and the auto white balance always kept the colors true. Depth of field, while not film-like, was better than most video cameras. Edge sharpness was better than my Alpha 57, but saturation looked more video-like than film-like. Again, you can use full auto, full manual or several combinations in between. Your outdoor vacation shots will simply be amazing. It shoots video better than most cameras under 1000 dollars, especially if you go through the menu and turn off some of the automatic features. So why the three stars?When I shot some indoor footage at home, I was expecting decent results, and a first quick look didn't disappoint. But as I looked with a practiced eye, I saw blue vertical lines throughout the image on all my indoor footage. Granted, they are very subtle and in very soft focus, but they are there regardless of the camera settings. I noticed them particularly when slowly panning against solid colored areas like a plain wall. At fist, I thought it might be an interaction with my LED room lights, but this was dispelled when I saw the blue bars in the outdoor footage as well, just not as prevalent. This may be a subtle problem, and many viewers may never notice it or be bothered by it unless it's brought to their attention. But to me, it means I could never use this camera for footage I intend to use in a project. The blue bars are caused by what is known as fixed pattern noise in the image sensor. It's not something you can solve by a firmware upgrade or by replacing it with another camera of the same model. While fixed pattern noise exists to some extent in any image sensor, it is usually mistaken for grain and not visible as a pattern of vertical lines.Another huge disappointment is there is no HDMI port. I like to hook the camera to a TV to set up various parameters and see the live results as I make changes. No can do with this camera. It also means you can't immediately play back footage from the camera on a TV until you edit it and put it on a disk or an SD card if your TV has a slot. There is also no external mike jack, so you are relegated to using only the built in mikes.Sound quality is clear, but there is no means of making any adjustments to the volume or turning off the AGC. However, the AGC does a good job bringing down the levels of loud music without distortion.In conclusion, the image quality is excellent on this camera aside from the aforementioned sensor noise. That may not be noticed in outdoor shots, and may not be objectionable enough to most users on indoor shots.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony A3000 compared to Canon T3i, Nikon D3100, and Olympus E-PL1", "Author": "Richard Goulmassian", "ReviewID": "RA95A4LF6LBIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have come to the conclusion that most of the reviewers of this camera do not own any other cameras with which to make a competent and accurate comparison! Unless you are looking at a review from a professional site that does nothing but camera reviews, most consumer reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt! You have to keep in mind that for a review to have meaning, you must know what camera(s) the consumer is comparing the A3000 to and if the photos are being taken under similar conditions. Comparing the A3000 to a 6MP Canon is useless and so is comparing photos that are shot under different lighting conditions or using different ISO settings or different lenses (zoom versus wide angle).I am not going to go into all of the details as to which camera has what features since my primary concern is picture quality followed by video quality. Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos!I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera. I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23\" HP LCD screen. I did not print them out but viewed them at 200-300% to check out every bit of detail. I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000. The second best - Canon T3i ( not as good as the Sony from ISO 100-1600, but just a little better than the Sony at 3200), third place goes to to the Olympus E-PL1 which did very well when you consider that it has a 12mp sensor versus the others that range from 14.2MP to 20.1MP. In LAST place is the Nikon D3100.The D3100 is better than my old Nikon D40x for sure but not as good as any of the other cameras I used in this comparison. You could say that it is not fair since the Nikon has 14.2MP and the others that rated better have 18-20MP. But then, the Olympus with 12.3MP also did better than the D3100!In terms of Video quality, the Canon T3i and Sony A3000 are pretty close with the T3i being slightly better. The Olympus PL1 fell to last place because the output is in 720p when all the others are 1080p. Nikon D3100 took third place in video quality.Hope that helps a little in clearing up some of the picture quality issues between at least this batch of cameras.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Real Sleeper", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"panda girl\"", "ReviewID": "R3JJ36F9U0S4AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Reviewed by Pauline's husband:I traded in my Sony NEX-6 for the A3000 based on the positive reviews of Sony's new 20MP sensor + JPEG processing. I have the Sony a99, RX1, and RX100m2. I shoot primarily JPEGs and have never been happy with the JPEG output of the NEX-6.The EVF on the A3000 is small and dark. The LCD screen is low res. And it's annoying to have to push a button to toggle between the two. It's not the best build quality (it's not bad, however) but, BUT, the image quality is much better than the NEX-6. And the kit 18-55 is surprisingly very sharp. It looks like a DSLR but it's pretty compact and light. I used it this weekend comfortably with a Black Rapid wrist strap. AF was fast enough for an outdoor event.When a better spec'd A3000 comes out, I'll bite for sure. I found the image quality of the NEX-6 + 35mm f1.8 to be about half way between the RX100m2 and the RX1 but the A3000 is 75+% of the RX1! This $350 camera w/lens is a giant killer when it comes to image quality!!!", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth it for the in-camera automatic HDR processing...THIS SHOULD GET 10 STARS!!!!!", "Author": "THE-GO-BETWEEN", "ReviewID": "R1TBAXMX5WIJT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I now have two of these A3000's....Unfortunately AMAZON is selling this camera for 60 to 70 dollars more than they should.  This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options....again all in-camera...that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos.I have used it in Sedona ...just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done.......it is like the Sony A37 and others in the Alpha series re the HDR capabilities and the A3000 has an APS-C sensor ...so it immediately separates itself from so called fixed lens bridge cameras since they all have tiny sensors.How Sony can price a version of an  SLR like this at this price (again Amazon is totally out of line in their price currently) is beyond me....even their small CYBER shots are more expensive and their NEX line doesn't offer built in view finders like this one which uses the same E mount lenses.  The A3000 is kind of odd in that it is more in the Alpha series but then again it has a big foot in the NEX series because of the lens mount..  It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses!!!The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu..So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000. It is much lighter and smaller than the A37. But it is just as capable giving on pause why they would pay almost double for the A58 which is commonly known as the A37's evolutionary offspring...This A3000 came to earth out of nowhere since it is an E mount camera but looks nothing like an NEX line of camera... It has been mentioned here that you can use old glass by using very cheap and easily found lens adapters like Canon EOS or Nikon to E mount...These sell from 12 dollars to 25 dollars on Amazon and EBAY.....Yes you lose the auto focus ability...but the vibration technology is in the body not the lens on Sony cameras.  The meter system of course will still work by you setting the aperture on the lens and then the camera will automatically set the shutter speed.  You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter...or a T mount adapter....You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it... Not so with Sony.I have used this camera extensively at Joshua Tree and Sedona...re the HDR effects... I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job. The slats in the patio cover with the sun  (yes we have had lots of sun in SOCAL this winter) created lines of high contrast areas but with the HDR working, it automatically resolved/mitigated that issue without the use of fill flash.....though of course that too is available with the A3000.I own a lot of Nikon pro models but carry these Sony cameras with me as well due to the sensor size and the HDR capabilities..Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now.. This is stupidly under priced ...The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations....The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37.....you have to push a button to switch between the two....the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line.... (the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery).  You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY...Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers...One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like!  You can  let in more or less light  by adjusting the shutter and/or aperture  depending on the situation and you can see exactly what the final image will look like if not using HDR.....  So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments....This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get...the A37 operates the same way.. Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great......for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with .......and the raising of the ISO number will brighten the image instantly on the EVF/LCD so you can start looking at grain issues though this camera is capable of mitigating that as well..automatically!Again...the in-camera HDR  abilities of this camera scream out \"BUY ME\" ..and at this price who can resist?...The HDR can show up in automatic ways on some of the auto settings and low light settings...but you have control of it in the DRIVE mode .and Sony has an HDR painterly effect in another menu that that gives you a choice of low, medium, and high painterly effect.which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect. I was able to use this HDR painterly effect in near darkness in Sedona of Cathedral Rock while at Crescent Moon Ranch Park with just a faint afterglow illuminating this striking  feature while the sun had gone down behind the mountain in the distance on which Jerome is located .  The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon!  Utterly amazing....and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR....so you don't get predictive HDR like I think the new Samsung Galaxy 5 will have....So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken...since this is what in real time the LCD/EVF is revealing ..if you make that  middle exposure too underexposed then everything will shift in the 3 exposures to greatly underexpose what you are shooting...  So for example when it got very dark at Cathedral Rock, I let in as much light as I could so that the underexposure exposure of the three shots  was able to bring up enough shadow areas ..At some point you may need to then use a tripod but you will be shocked what you can get away with using the A3000 handheld...It is hard to explain but there is no rocket science to it....you just have to play with it to get the best HDR effect in very low light situations.  But the beauty of it is you see the results instantly and can make adjustments rather than waiting to get to a computer to process a series of bracketed photos....and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well.  Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting.If you get this camera...you MUST make a point of understanding where these HDR options are in the menu.  It is kind of lame of Sony to not explain how to use these incredible features BETTER in their promo literature or in the expanded camera manual ...you sort of have to figure this out on your own when (for my purposes) this is the very most important feature of the camera...the ONLY reason why I bought it (them).Why Sony doesn't elaborate on their astounding in-camera totally automatic HDR  processing is beyond me...I have taken thousands of images with the A3000 and A37 which both have exactly the same HDR functions.  I can attest to the fact that this is a revolutionary tool to have at your disposal while doing photography of all sorts.HDR is not meant to do a good job of subject matter in motion since there is a time span required to take three images of varying EV values.  In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum...When you take an HDR photo in low light it has been my experience that it takes longer ..much longer...for the camera to process the final image...The camera seems to be really thinking things out under those low light conditions....it is not instantaneous....This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera.....EVER!!  Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well....You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot....heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception..  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either..Dang..I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake!!!!  The consumer wins big time on the A3000.  What a deal!!!  SORRY FOR ANY TYPOS..I AM WORN OUT..EVERYBODY SHOULD OWN ONE OF THESE A3000'S ....A CLASSIC UNDER-THE-RADAR CAMERA!!!!!!

First off, this is a $279 camera which gives you DSLR type features (interchangeable lens, comfortable grip, hot shoe) AND a fantastic 20MP sensor.  To find similar resolution from another camera you'll have to pay $450 or more.  So if you want to spend money go ahead but don't knock this camera for minor issues.

My last camera (PowerShot G15) was unceremoniously retired when I had to jump into a lake. Before that, I owned a Nikon D90 with a Nikkor 50mm 1.4 and 24mm 2.8D.The Canon was a great camera with a great lens, but my wife and I were always disappointed with its image quality vs. what we'd had with the D90. It (the G15) had all of the manual control I could ask for but lacked punch in low light situations. Also, its sensor size vs. that of the D90 was quite underwhelming. Abysmal, really.So, the Canon was drowned but, due to my having purchased a warranty, I was reimbursed for the current value of the camera. I went to the store expecting to get the Sony Nex-3N, but saw this camera. I will take a low-res EVF over no finder any day of the week.Regarding that: I have seen detractors of this camera for its low-res EVF and display. Those things don't bother me, as I don't spend very much time on composition and just like to ensure that everything that I want to capture in the frame is there. Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either.Besides, the thing that matters is the output. Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great. Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting.The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough. Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings. It takes a little more time but that's fine with me. If i want manual control, it's there... but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition. Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough.  However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement.As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it. I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it. At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there. I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice.It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either. I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those. Having said that, it by no means feels rugged. I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection. It might survive a knock or two, though.The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting). In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually. Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top. Oh well. Again, this is just the sensor and the basics to get your image there. Lens is capable enough too. It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback).Memory Card: Sandisk Ultra 8 gig.

What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it. I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip. I don't know why NEX/Olympus/FUJI make their bodies compact with larger SLR-like grips. Because after attaching most lenses, all cameras get bulky. Yes, some NEX cameras like 5T/6/7 do have good grips but nothing like A3000. I'm not going to bash A3000 for its EVF. It's an entry level camera and I don't even expect it to be there. Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact. But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature. It is useful enough just to frame shots in bright sunlight, but that's about it.If you are planning to use manual focus lenses with adapters, it can be hard to focus for some shots, even with focus peaking activated. The LCD has painfully low resolution. I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K.Image quality is very good. NOTE: I'm going to talk about X A1, which has bayer sensor just like A3000, I'm NOT talking abour X-trans sensors. I have used Fuji X A1 and I have to say the RAW images from A3000 are just as good up to ISO 400, and almost as good up to ISO 1600. After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji. Jpeg images from A3000, however have not as much noise(but loss of fine detail) due to aggressive noise reduction by BIONZ processor. I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji. Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds. I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels. But again, this is only relevant if you go above ISO 800.I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers. But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money. If you are a serious video shooter then I suppose you should look for cameras like Canon or even other Sony cameras.It has plenty of manual modes to boot and good auto modes. It only shoots at 3.5 fps but I don't think this should be an issue, unless you make a living as a hardcore sports photographer or something similar. A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras.Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000.Only these are the real cons according to me for A3000.- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact. EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway.- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing. But really no complaints for the price I paid($279).- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size).- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels. More than any other camera I have used at same ISO and shutter speeds. Perhaps I have a defective sensor on my A3000.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pefect balance between SLR and Point-And-Shoot", "Author": "N. Krumpe", "ReviewID": "R1LRLEZK4T8077", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony A3000 nicely walks the line between the power of a DSLR and the ease of a point-and-shoot. I took this camera on a post-Thanksgiving hike, and was stunned at how easy it was to get all the shots I wanted. This camera that I've only had for about a week was so easy to use as I a variety of pictures:* Kids playing in a creek* Close-up (macro) shots of leaves and rocks* Action shots of my dog running around* Portrait shots of my wife and her sister* HDR-bracketed shots of a bright sky and the darker woods and creekNow, nearly any camera can take pictures like these, but the Sony has an \"intelligent\" mode that automatically detects the situation, and makes all the necessary adjustments for me. In other words, all of those pictures were taken without my ever needing to think about or adjust my camera. For example, it recognized when I was taking a close-up photo and appropriately adjusted the aperture and shutter speeds to give me sharp detail in the foreground, with a softly blurred background. Moments later, I took a picture of my wife, and the camera automatically saved two versions of the picture I took: the original, and a separate one cropped to highlight my wife's face.It really was a pleasure to just take pictures without having to think about it.  And, I was very happy with the quality of those pictures. In particular, portraits of my family and pictures of my dog were clear and crisp.Generally speaking, I much prefer the power and control of a DSLR. There is much to be said for being able to tweak every little detail before I take a photo. So, when I want to take my time and carefully compose each shot, I am likely to stick with my Pentax K5 ii DSLR. However, when I'm out and about and don't want to be slowed down by thinking about my camera, the Sony A3000 is a clear winner.I think the Sony A3000 is the perfect camera for someone who wants:* The flexibility of interchangeable lenses* The ability to take a wide variety of picture types, from close-up to portrait to landscape, from daytime to nighttime, without giving a lot of thought to which settings need to be changed* The ability to take panoramic photos (it does a great job automatically stitching together a series of photos)* A less intimidating control panel (there are about half as many buttons and dials on the Sony than there are on my Pentax)* Something lighter and easier to carry (the Sony weighs about a half-pound less than my Pentax)Understand: this is not a DSLR. If that's what you are after, then you should look elsewhere, and plan to spend a bit more. But if you want a nice compromise between ease and power, then I highly recommend the Sony A3000.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for an entry-level camera!", "Author": "TheTerrorBeyond", "ReviewID": "R1QYQZ9SKV9NM1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed.  I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point.  The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise.  This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this.  The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built.The -4 to +3.5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera.  The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted.  This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses.I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice.  This camera looks like a DSLR instead of Sony's other mirrorless cameras.  Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand.  The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability.The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing.  At the end of the day, you aren't going to view your pictures on your camera, you are going to view them on your computer and then print.  Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera.The camera has a fairly extensive manual setting that you should really learn to use, as you will be able to get the best performance out of your camera when you understand your shutter speeds, ISO, aperture, etc.  This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings.

There are, of course, more than a few differences, considering the electronic viewfinder option alone costs as much as the A3000!The NEX has a lot of very cool high-tech amenities such as WiFi live viewfinder for smartphones and tablets, a gorgeous, ultra sharp high resolution touch screen, two control wheels and customizable buttons, and also has some far better photographic features like phase detection autofocus, 10fps shooting speed, 1080 60p video...The A3000 is far more pedestrian and clearly targets the amateur upgrading from a point and shoot camera and seeking the picture quality improvements of an SLR. The screen is not as sharp, the EVF is OK but a little grainy; shooting speed is only 3.5fps; 1080 video limited to 60i/24p; and there are fewer control buttons so you have to rely more on menus to get to the various settings. Still, you're getting a higher resolution sensor (20MP vs. 16 for the NEX series,) a built-in flash and E-mount lens compatibility (this means it uses the same lens as the NEX series), so the A3000 is no slouch.Picture quality is excellent, and the performance in low light is just as good as on the NEX.I LIKE:- Sony E-mount compatibility- Built-in pop-up flash- Built-in stereo microphones- Accessory hot shoe with smart connector (supports optional stereo microphone)- Low light performance- Video quality- Excellent picture quality overall- Battery life- in-camera charging via USB cable- Simple, intuitive user interface- Built-in electronic viewfinder (great for shooting in bright sunlight)- Light weight, good balance, comfortable to hold- Available inexpensive adapters for just about any type of mount, allowing you to use old SLR lenses you can find at garage sales (in full manual mode, of course, don't expect autofocus!)I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH:- No external battery charger (one is available as an option, or aftermarket ) -- This is a Sony design choice on all their cameras- The resolution on the screen and the EVF is a little low- The shooting speed is limited- The selection of Sony E-mount lenses is still limited (and they are pricier than equivalent DSLR lenses)THE BOTTOM LINE:The A3000 is a great choice for a compact camera user who is on a tight budget, ready to move up to a fully controllable camera with interchangeable lenses also capable of shooting quality HD video, while retaining a simple user interface and powerful automatic modes.

I have owned 3 or 4 low end 35 mm SLR cameras (film) but I do not consider myself a serious photographer.  When digital camera came out,over a few years I purchase 3 or 4 different point and shoot models and was fairly satisfied with the performance.For a couple of hundred dollars more, you can move up to the Sony a3000 and I think the money will be well spent.Here are the features I really like about the Sony a3000.  The first thing you notice is the grip.  What a difference from the typical point and shoot models. This one has a real professional grip that just fits your hand perfectly.  That makes taking pictures much more efficient.  The second big difference is the battery.  It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery pack.  All you need to do is hook the cable to the USB port on your computer and let it charge.  It also comes with an adaptor that plugs into a standard wall outlet.  The battery can be used much longer than the standard AA batteries that most point and shoot cameras use.What I really love is the quality of pictures this camera will take. They are absolutely amazing. Much sharper, better balanced than any pictures I have ever taken.  I found that in normal room lighting, even at night, it is not necessary (or advisable) to use the flash.  The clarity and detail of the pictures are so much better than the point and shoot cameras I have previously owned.There are a couple of things I did not like. One the cable used to connect the camera to the computer is only about 24\" long.  I don't think another 12\" would have increased the cost that much but it sure would have made it easier to use.The straps were extremely difficult to attach to the camera.  And the lens cover does not come with a safety cord.  I suspect that is because the lens is changeable - but I have been used to the lens cover coming with a safety cord.And the other thing I found a bit disappointing was the viewfinder.  The experience was not the same as the 35 mm SLR cameras that I was used to.  For now I am taking pictures using the LCD screen.This is a very sophisticated camera and it will take a lot of time to really master all the things this camera can do.  There is a bit of a learning curve - truthfully a fairly steep learning curve to master the camera.  But you can get great shots almost immediately out of the box.The software for your computers does not come on a disc, it must be downloaded from Sony.  But it was quick and easy.  Transferring your images from the camera to the computer is quick and easy.I purchased a 32 BG memory card and you can hold an amazing number of photographs or you can turn this into a video camera.All in all I am delighted with this camera. This is not for the professional photographer.  But for the serious amateur,  I think that it is certainly worth investing a couple hundred more to move up from the typical point and shoot to this camera.  The quality of the pictures is so much better and the versatility of this camera is amazing.I love it and am sure the more time I spend learning all its features, the more satisfied I will be.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good budget camera, even in low light.", "Author": "Patrick Holt \"txdragon\"", "ReviewID": "R1WG6KHA6ICV2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance.

If you are a beginner and in the market for a DSLR, skip this and get one of the Canon Rebels or Nikon D3xxx for a bit more money. You would be more happy. The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job. I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319. Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all. In fact, it 's a NEX in disguise. Make no mistake about it. What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight. With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification. Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line. Now the best part of this camera is the 20.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen. It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies. If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom. I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing. One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW. It wastes storage space in the SD card. Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera. Yes, you have to plug the camera into a wall socket using a USB2 cord. Not a big deal, but it's a strange arrangement. Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features. They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality.What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality. It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon !!). The kit lens itself could very well cost about $150 in retail. How Sony makes any profit out of this camera is beyond me. The build for the camera body is no slouch either. It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around. Its user interface is the typical NEX style with deep menus. Don't let that scare you. The deep menu would slow you down but its graphical interface is quite intuitive.So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD. For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition.

Technically, it belongs to a category of cameras known as \"ILCE\" ( \"interchangeable lens digital camera).Unlike a DSLR (or SLR) there is no mirror system to provide true TTL image viewing. Instead you can select between two viewers: the electronic viewfinder or the 7.5mm LCD panel on the rear of the camera.SLR/DSLR veterans will immediately recognize most of the basic functions provided by an infinity rotating  mechanical mode dial on the top of the camera. This offers two fully automatic modes (\"intelligent Auto\" and \"Superior Auto\", two traditional priority modes (aperture and shutter), a scene selection mode, a panoramic shooting mode and a full manual mode. For both the priority modes, the additional adjustments are then made via a control wheel on the rear of the camera body.Video is captured by pressing a prominent \"Movie\" button adjacent to the viewfinder. Yes, you will be taking some inadvertent videos as you get used to this camera. HD video is captured in the .mts HD format.This camera accepts both standard SD cards or Sony's proprietary Memory Stick form factors.Ergonomically, this camera is comfortable to hold; the right side of the body has a protruding grip area with a textured rubber coating that aids handling (especially in cold weather). Like most cameras large enough to accept interchangeable lenses, it is obviously designed with right-handed users in mind. With the included lens installed it weighs just over 16 ounces.It is hard to find any faults with the overall layout of the camera. While I wish there was an manual button on the lens mount to switch from manual to auto focus modes, the electronic, menu-driven option for this (along with the flash mode) is available in the top-most level of menu options.The quality of both still images and video is excellent. Shooting in a variety of lighting conditions and distances, I found a very neutral rendering of most colors. Video quality is also very good. The integrated microphone provides surprisingly good audio.This is a camera that is generally intuitive to use (and what is not intuitive is *excellently* described in an included user guide (and a supplemental creative handbook).One minor  quibble: even though the model of this camera is \"A3000\", if you want to find information about it on Sony's support site, you should now that is known there by the model number \"ILCE-3000').

There are some exceptional Sony models that perform flawlessly, and that will fit in your pocket, such as the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V. In order to move to a camera that will not fit in your pocket, like this one, you need to get compelling improvements in performance.One of the reasons to move to a DSLR style camera such as this one, is to get a real viewfinder. The typical pocket model cameras have an LCD back, and no viewfinder. It is hard to take pictures in bright sunlight, because the LCD is hard to see in bright light. In effect, you are almost shooting blind. With a real viewfinder, you can accurately frame up a picture in all outdoor and indoor conditions. Unfortunately, I have to rate the viewfinder on this camera as poor to marginal. Outside, yes you can see the scene in bright light, but you are not looking at the image through glass, like a traditional SLR, but you are looking at an LCD screen through the viewfinder. I found the LCD to be rather low resolution and not in focus. I was unable to get a sharp view either with my glasses on or with them off, no matter where I rotated the diopter dial. The lack of resolution and clarity in the viewfinder causes you to lose one of the main motivators for going to a camera like this from a pocket model.The second motivation you would have to go to a camera like this is that you can purchase interchangeable lenses. The problem is, that the basic performance of this camera body would not motivate me to go out and spend thousands of dollars on lenses.So, if you purchase this camera, I am sure you will be pleased with its ease of use and the exceptional quality pictures it takes. For me though, if I had to choose between purchasing this camera and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V, the Cyber-shot would be the hands down winner. Simple to use, exceptional pictures, crystal clear LCD screen, fits in your pocket, wide zoom range, and long battery life. If you really need to move up to a DSLR style camera, I would recommend moving to one of the higher end Sony cameras with a REAL viewfinder.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Battery Life Good Value", "Author": "Jared B.", "ReviewID": "R13N237TQTCS92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has excelllent battery life.

As he noted, 20 degree days (smaller sensor P&S; cameras, mobile devices) may make picture takers complain and frown while 50 degree days (entry level DSLRs, compact interchangeable lens cameras) often bring about a smile from photography hobbyists but no one talks or remembers 40 degree days (an arguably curious crossover like the A3000).Yet, here I am typing about it. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear to me what market segment Sony aims to attract with this camera until I it dawned on me I\u2019m right in the midst of it. No matter how I think I can slice it, fundamentally, I am a point and shoot user who is more interested in looking like I have some skills rather than actually devoting the time, effort and dedication required to refine my limited abilities with higher level equipment.In auto modes, the A3000 can produce some very good photos. It has the form factor of a DSLR with a competitive APS-C sensor but otherwise is deficient in comparable build quality although at the price point it is somewhat understandable. On the other side of the ledger, with the flexibility of interchangeable lenses and the features of LCD and EVF, for me potentially it could be a step above most comparable P&S; competition, with the caveat the prospective buyer has to understand exactly what they are getting since in auto mode specifically, I don\u2019t believe definitively superior Image quality will be realized.The mirrorless A3000 is lightweight, in my opinion as comfortable in that regard as any bridge I have tested. It can use the Sony E-mount lenses, somewhat of a mixed blessing since I also think they are rather pricey. With an optional adaptor, A-mounts may also be used. That is a major consideration, since as noted above with the included 18-55mm lens only, I didn\u2019t feel breadth of functionality and overall image quality justifies taking this camera instead of my Pentax X-5 on an upcoming trip.Other factors are the viewfinders as at 230K pixelation neither the non-tilting LCD nor low resolution EVF are very impressive. The latter plastic housed component also may present some problems for eye-glass wearers. Additionally, I have yet to get a diopter setting with it I am happy with and rear positioned control setting wheel seems comparably minimalist compared to others I have used.Most functions have to be accessed via a menuing system that seems a bit tedious to me. It might be merely what I have become accustomed to but as the power switch is positioned in exactly the same location as the zoom switch on the Pentax, I have already turned off the camera a few times when I forgot which body I had in hand (they are very similar in size and weight) and thought I was about to zoom in on a subject. Also, while there is a quality drop off with the Pentax, at 10fps compared to the A3000\u2019s 3.5 fps in burst shooting, which one I would opt for with motion shots is a toss-up, although for panoramic shots, the A3000\u2019s relatively quiet shutter is impressive.  I found both AF and low light performance very good.  It also features a built-in flash and hot shoe housing.I\u2019m not sure Sony\u2019s engineers were any more certain of who ultimately they were targeting either since images cannot be saved in RAW format independently. It seems to me any user who elects to use RAW and manipulate thereafter would find the requirement to save in JPEG as well an unnecessary annoyance. This camera will produce great everyday photos with the base kit and has features that will allow those who are interested in more flexibility than is typically the case with most point and shoot cameras to upgrade their equipment without being initially overwhelmed, but for the experienced DSLR user this model is most likely one that can be passed by.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "awsome..camera", "Author": "Jimmy Trevino", "ReviewID": "R3C965E19JS4YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its was a gift for my son he loves it.he say the pix are great.easy to use good price thanx", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice camera", "Author": "grace labrador", "ReviewID": "R1COK1T9IJ4K2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for an amateur like me, it is very easy to handle.Makes very good pictures.

It's like Sony is trying to fake consumers out and sell them a camera that appears to be one thing, but internally is something totally different. It's basically packaging a mirrorless camera into a small SLR sized body. So you end up with a camera that loses out on compactness but doesn't have any of the advantages of an actual DSLR or typical mirrorless system. I suppose if you are someone that just wants a camera that is easier to hold and work with than a compact system, you might buy this. But with prices on DSLRs having come down so much it's really hard to see why someone would stick with the limitations of the technology in this camera versus just paying a bit more and getting a camera that will far out-perform it in terms of image quality, speed of autofocus, lens options, etc. Or sticking with the Sony NEX range of mirrorless systems (or any of the other excellent brands with similar cameras) which have the advantage of being much more compact and easy to carry around. Having said all that, if you compare this camera to others in its price range, it does do a nice job overall. It has some of the excellent Sony features I've always liked such as panorama mode, handheld shake mode (shoots several photos to remove shake, nice for non-moving subjects in low light) and excellent video capability, and the image quality certainly will far outstrip many similarly priced cameras as well.
