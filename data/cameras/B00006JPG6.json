{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good value so far", "Author": "smrvanc", "ReviewID": "R93J8J5G59ZFT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this in for use with the 4 door kit by \"Crime Stopper,\" to actuate the 5th door lock. The 4 door kit has the \"brain\" (relays) necessary.  When I received the 4 door kit it was actually made by a third party manufacturer \"Tesco\" (or something, I threw away the box) not \"crime stopper.\"  This is identical to the 2 wire actuators (for rear doors, with no internal switch) in the 4 door kit and works seamlessly.  The plastic injection molding is a little rough compared to the DEI 524-n model, but doesn't affect performance.  Installation can be tricky for a novice, I would advise you to have a lot of time, patience, and moderate mechanical inclination to install this. If you installed these every day for work you could probably do it in relatively quickly but if you have never done this before dedicate a lot of time for this stuff because you need to determine how to mount this inside the door, and may come across some problems. (For example the tolerances are pretty tight between the window roll up mechanism and other components inside the door.  I would advise you to research how other people have done this.)  A lot of the time of install is bending the actuator rod to travel parallel to the lock rod. I found this to be somewhat difficult as it is some trial and error and angle bending, sometimes on multiple planes.  You basically install, test, disassemble, adjust, reinstall, repeat.  This can be difficult working in the confines of the door.If this lasts 2 years I would be happy for the price of less than $10 but would be more frustrated with having to take the door apart again.  The travel, \"throw\" of the actuator is about 7/8 of an inch, more than enough for my toyota, and the unit has plenty of power to push the rod. The \"clamp\" that connects the door rod to the actuator rod seemed a little cheesy, a small piece of cast metal with three screws to mate the two together.  I used a lot of lock tite on those parts for prevention. I don't really have faith in the system but its working so far. On the front doors and 5th door of my rav4 I was able to mount these where I believe the factory ones are mounted, in holes about 1/4 inch square.  After the fact I found little square plastic anchors at Lowes that seem like the would have worked well for mounting the metal bracket (better than the clip system supplied.)The true test is if this lasts as long as my car, as I believe there is no manufacturer's warranty.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Crime Stopper CS-610SI Power Door Lock Actuator", "Author": "R.
