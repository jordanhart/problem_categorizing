Without even a modicum of hesitation, I can proudly say that this Panasonic camera more than exceeded my expectations.The 14 MP camera takes clear and crisp photographs and has a smorgasbord of different settings to make the pictures you take precisely how you want it. You can adjust your camera setting before you snap your picture, and you can also conveniently edit it after you take your picture. So you can never really take bad pictures. I find the settings to be really great.I also wanted a camera that would be good for action pictures. Often times, on my previous camera, I would take moving photographs and the pictures would come out blurry and you can tell that it was taken in motion. In contrast, this camera is wholly different. I tested out several moving pictures and the camera adroitly captures the moment I want captured beautifully, without any kind of visible motion blurriness.However, I leave the best aspect of this camera till last: the unthinkably great HD video capture. When buying a camera I wanted something that could capture HD videos so I can record different moments in film and store them, and perhaps something that would be good for YouTube videos: I found it. This video camera records gloriously crisp and colorful 720p HD. As good as the quality of the photo camera itself is, I think the video capture function is remarkably better. You simply just cannot fault it.I have never really been a Panasonic person. I know their stuff is purportedly of good quality and durable, but I have just never bought a product other than batteries. However, after buying this magnificent camera, I think I'll be investing in a lot more Panasonic products.I went in with pretty low expectations, and came out thoroughly impressed.Needless to say, I have been taking a whole lot of pictures on this thing.By the way, for the record, I haven't yet read the instruction manual, yet I have no problem operating the camera. I think that speaks wonders of its ease of use.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Make sure and use that wrist strap!", "Author": "lraney87", "ReviewID": "R1W2VNZ48VOW24", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a decent camera. I'm no camera aficionado, I was just looking for something simple to carry around for impromptu pictures. I'd say everything about it is okay, but I'm writing this review more for pointing out flaws for future purchasers to consider (isn't that how most reviews go these days? :)). Here goes: Don't buy this camera if you're the kind of person who wants to zoom into the picture after you've taken it to make sure the pimple on your chin isn't visible. The touch screen navigation is super slow and not exactly sensitive. After you zoom on a picture, you have to tap the screen relentlessly for it to recognize your finger and actually move to the area of the picture you're wanting to zoom in on. Secondly, and I know I'm not the only person experiencing this because I've read other reviews on the internet while I was searching for a cost-effective solution, if you drop the camera, it's pretty much done for. I'd had this camera for just shy of a month when I dropped it on the ground and the sliding lens cover malfunctioned. It's really frustrating, because everything still works, it just doesn't recognize that the lens cover has been slid open. I can still look at pictures that have been taken, etc. I sent it back to Panasonic in hopes that A. they wouldn't notice the scratch on the corner, or B. that if they did notice, it was warranty-voiding. No dice. They wrote me back with a quote to repair it, and it's actually more expensive than buying a new camera. So, in conclusion, if you have an iron grip and aren't obsessed with reviewing your pictures until you upload them to your computer, this really is a good camera for the price.

Its super easy to carry around so you'll end up taking more pictures because you won't mind having it with you all the time. The Intelligent Auto works pretty well and it has face and scene detection which is great, along with really good image stabilization. Battery life on this thing is great too, You can take about 800-1000 pictures with this thing before you have to charge the battery.My only con is the low-light capability, its pretty poor. Outdoor or indoors with adequate lighting makes for some excellent pictures, but in low light the pictures come out pretty grainy. And the flash on this camera is rather weak so that doesn't help much either. You can raise the ISO up and it has a High Sensitivity scene mode as well to try to help make the picture come out, but only adds to the grain. Now this is expected in such a compact camera so I'm not docking because of it, but its definitely worth noting if you're looking to take a lot of low-light pictures.Overall this is a great buy, certainly not gonna take the same quality pics as its big brothers but if you want a simple, good quality compact then this is your camera.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product for an awesome price!!!", "Author": "Ana Victoria Healey", "ReviewID": "R3O37ZWRJU0YE6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a really good camera for a really good price.

Takes good pictures and great HD video quality even when shooting small detail things like  necklaces for example. The inteligent mode does a great job recognizing the scene and its a very simple camera easy to work.The major failure I`ve come to notice is that in playback function upon zooming and scrolling the picture the touch panel does a lousy job and its function becomes rubish. Other than that the combination touch panel- real buttons do a great job.I would recomend this camera specially for the price, but advice to look around for better options if touch panel isnt your thing or u can manage with a camera bit larger and not so stylish.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad Battery Contact", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R30038ECTUXI04", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I put the new and fully-charged battery into my new camera and it did not work unless I pressed on the bottom part of the camera.

Both take good pictures, but neither is in the same league as my Nikon DSLR, which is what I'd expect. I think a point-and-shoot camera should excel at just that -- letting you quickly capture a decent shot and be done with it. The Panasonic iA mode seems to do a very good job of selecting the right scene mode, especially indoors, vs. the Canon, but neither does a bad job.I have shot more video with the FP3 than the SD1400, and the former's video quality is truly amazing for what the camera is. Note that you cannot zoom at all while filming with the FP3, but with the SD1400, you can use *digital* zoom up to 4X, which gets recorded as such; this is not necessarily an advantage, since you are losing resolution in the process with digital zoom vs. optical (and you can do the same thing after the fact with a good video editor anyway).The Canon does seem to do a slightly better job with indoor flash. The Panasonic wins on the usability factor with the touchscreen, but not by much. It's a double-edged sword, with picture-taking selections being faster, but picture viewing being more clunky (e.g., you can't touch and hold a button to auto-repeat a navigation action, and zooming is limited).Comparing the zoom quality (both are 4X optical), one thing I like very much about the Panasonic vs. the Canon is the number of zoom stages.  You need to understand that power zooms on this kind of camera are not seamless.  The Canon has exactly 8 zoom steps from wide to telephoto; the Panasonic has 22.  This means you can do a better job of using the full frame (and all the meagapixels) with the Panasonic, rather than capturing more image than you really wanted.  I consider this a nice advantage.All that said, as much as I love the Canon's tiny size, it also makes the camera sort of fumbly to pull out of your pocket and shoot with; you have to pay attention to which way is up, etc. The Panasonic is certainly bigger, but still pocketable, but it's also easier to grab \"blind\" and get it open for shooting without fumbling around, since you can feel the difference between top and bottom, front and back. Lastly, the folded optics of the Panasonic (i.e., the sealed mechanism) means no dust and pocket lint gets in the mechanism to cause problems over the long term; this also makes it more truly pocketable, but if you always keep it in a case then it's a wash).Overall, for the price difference between the two, I would go with the FP3 unless you absolutely must have the smallest camera out there). I happened to get my SD1400 on sale around Christmas for essentially the same as the FP3, so that's how I wound up with both, thinking I would return one or the other. I wound up keeping them both for the different reasons above.As for build quality, while some people seem to think the FP3 (and FP1) feel cheaply built, I can tell you this: I had an FP1 at first, which got run over in its soft case by my (heavy) car.  I fully expected to find a bunch of plastic and metal shards in the case.  Instead, although the LCD did crack and craze a bit, the camera was mopstly intact *still works* in every other respect!  So I would call build quality excellent!", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "VERY POOR IMAGE QUALITY", "Author": "Phil_D", "ReviewID": "R1ZHJCN6PW39RG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I love Panny, but this camera is a weak effort.  The low light performance is abysmal and noisy, image quality is TERRIBLE even for a budget camera of this generation.By image quality, I mean contrast, sharpness, tone, flare, and color, all of which are very poor.  There is no distortion.Can I say anything good about it?  Well, I do like the menus, which are easy to navigate.  The flash is powerful and autofocus is fast and accurate (like all Panny's).  The size is just perfect - put it in your pocket and its invisible.  Surprisingly, the camera is very good for macro photography (maybe due to the ASPH lens?).  If you wanted a cheap book scanner for OCR, this would be ideal.  Pictures of my wedding ring were fairly sharp and contrasty, even full frame.  However, back away more than 3 feet and... well, I haven't seen such poor image quality in a compact since Kodak's from the mid 2000s.  I understand this is a budget camera, but they gave it the Lumix brand - why sell it at all with such disappointing performance?I think this exists just to make other Panny compacts look good.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not so good", "Author": "lumix", "ReviewID": "R3V42NFYYE82FF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cons: Image quality is not so good and the indoor IQ is a disaster...

I've now used it for two years, and I don't like it. It doesn't take very crisp or vibrant photos, and I'm told it's probably the poor lens.  The touch screen commands and menus are cumbersome to navigate even when they make sense, which is seldom.  The review of photos is sticky (doesn't move to the next photo as it should), and there's no way to enlarge the photo you're viewing (not sure any cameras can, but this can't).

I had the camera since '09 and I loved it very much.So, when buying a new camera, I did a lot of research.The camera was soo much smaller than my last one. I love it. It fits anywhere. I went around Universal the other day and had it in my back pocket.I wasn't so into the whole touch-screen thing. However, you really don't need to use it much except for looking through the pictures. The screen is different from an iphone and other touch-screen devices, so you're going to need to get use to it. I did it rather quickly.Some other reviewers complained about the speed the camera takes photos. It's probably like a 1.5 second delay. It's really not all that bad. My last camera was even worse because the flash had to charge up and it would take a good 15 seconds. So, this was definitely an upgrade for me.There's probably a million settings for everything. And it's super easy to figure them all out. I just leave my settings on auto though. I'm not trying to get pictures of plants, animals, kids in motion, fireworks, or any other thing they have settings for.Now, the first thing I did notice was the screen. Like, how it looked when you were viewing before snapping a picture. It looks kinda distorted. But as soon as you take a picture, you can see it's super clear.I was a little afraid of the possible picture quality since the lens was so little and didn't even come out. But none of that mattered.The pictures turn out amazing and I'm not even using the full 14mp. I think I'm actually at 3 mp because I don't have a lot of space on my sim card.Out in the sun, when not using flash, the pictures are super awesome. Super clear, wonderful colors. But, when you use flash in the dark-ish, the picture quality goes down a little.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.

I wanted something compact so as to not have to lug around a big Canon Rebel T1i, struggling with swapping lenses and to be able to capture unexpected shots without any setup.  The Panasonic FP3 is the easiest, best, well-designed little powerhouse!Any inexpensive point-and-shoot will have its flaws.  I expected this to possibly have noticeable low-light issues and focus-finding problems.  Needless to say I was surprised again and again when it produced fantastic results in a variety of conditions, both indoors and outside (even in difficult direct sunlight with sharp contrast conditions).My FAVORITE feature is the touch focus.  Focus is my pet-peeve with cheap cameras (even some not-so-cheap ones).  They focus-hunt.  Low-end Canons are huge offenders of blurry images.  THIS camera is amazing in that you merely touch the part of the screen you want to focus on and snap your picture.  Excellent results every time!  After experiencing this touch focus feature, I will make this a top requirement in any future camera purchase.  It's awesome, especially if you do composed shots where you may want the foreground blurred and the background to be in focus or vice versa.  Total control over focus is incredible.I haven't experienced any issue with the touch screen.  It's very responsive and the images can be viewed quickly.  I think earlier reviewers who complained of poor screen response and slow picture review had the old firmware.  Mine came with version 1.2, which is the most current firmware release, and so the previous problems were remedied.This camera is now my favorite and will not leave my side.

All in all its a great camera and I dont know any other camera for under $150 that has all these features.I bought another one for my uncle as a gift and he loves it!!

I was looking for a small, quick camera that takes good quality photos when I bought this. I used to have a Nikon Coolpix, but it was klunky and slow. I couldn't fit it in my purse very well and by the time it started up I had missed the picture I wanted to take. The Lumix is totally different, though! I could quickly pull it out of my purse, pull the lens cover down (no messing with on/off buttons) and BAM! picture was taken! It is super fast, amazing quality (better night pictures than my old coolpix), and I love the touchscreen. My only complaint is that the touch screen doesn't zoom in like you think it would (like an Iphone).

I needed an extremely adaptable camera that takes exceptional pictures at high speeds, and that, due to the nature of it's primary use, not overly expensive, and durable.I like that this camera does not have a retractable lens. The reason for this is that in the bobcat enclosures, we use pine shavings for our bedding. Retractable lenses leave more space for dirt and debris to get into the camera. The sliding lens cover is very useful, and easier to keep clean.The picture quality exceeded my expectations, and the settings for this point and shoot camera make it a very useful tool in photographing my subjects. The screen is a good size, though the camera was a little thicker than I wanted it to be.
