{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrific camera for a great price!", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R2HVO95AEZRGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been 9 mos and 1000's of pictures since I bought this camera and I have no regrets.  Although my wife still uses our 35 mm camera, most of the really good pictures we've taken in the past year (mostly of our kids) have come from my Finepix 2400. When I was shopping for a digicam last February, I compared this camera to the other 2.1 mpixel w/ 3x optical zoom offerings from Olympus (more money, no usb), Canon (digital elph...smaller, but more money, only 2x zoom, and proprietary battery), and Nikon (not as well reviewed as the others). The best features for the price fell out w/ the Finepix 2400. The only features it is missing  a video out to TV and movie mode.  I didn't think I'd ever really use these features so this was something I didn't mind missing out on.  Advantages: 3x optical zoom. Price is great. Most important: picture quality is superb. I take all my shots at the best resolution and highest quality.  The 64mb card I added holds around 80 pics and I rarely fill it (thats like 3 or 4  rolls of film.) If I was going away, I'd probably step down a level in resolution or quality to fit more. I print on a regular two year old hp printer on photo paper and the results are amazing. Unless you specifically look from a few inches away, you'd never know the pics are from a digicam. Downloading to computer is a snap w/ the usb adapter.  Just plug in the camera and it appears as a drive so you can do whatever you want. The included software has run fine on two computers, one w/ Win 98 and the other with WinME. Battery time is superb with NiMH batteries. I had heard all sorts of horror stories about digicams and battery life, but they last fine (I use the LCD about half the time). If I go out with fresh batteries they've never run out on me.  Downsides: Included photo viewer software is only fair and it took me a couple times to install correctly (note this was the photo viewing software, not the drivers...the drivers installed fine). Don't get me wrong, the software does the basics fine, it just isnt the greatest. On the plus side, Adobe Photodeluxe is included, and this is a terrific program. Low light performance is not great, but this is likely with any camera of this type. Startup and lag time between photos is also a little slow, but my understanding is this is also standard for digital cameras. Finally, the lag from shutter press to capture does take some getting used to.  Partially pressing the shutter button to \"ready\" the image helps, but you don't get the near instant response you do from a conventional 35mm camera. The zoom will also not work for a couple seconds when the camera is writing a picture to the card.  Summary- There are lots of 2.1 megapixel digital cameras out there.  The combination of great picture quality, all the features I wanted, and a price below the rest of the other cameras in it's class made this a great choice that has held up over time. I would buy this camera again. The only things it is missing are a movie mode (gimmicky and useless in my opinion) and a tv out jack.", "Date": "November 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Poor to non-existant repair service", "Author": "Jim Farris", "ReviewID": "R255S4TT95NGQ5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last September and fell in love with it immediately. Great quality pictures and easy to use. HOWEVER .. after 2 weeks of use I turned it on one day and it \"froze up\" -- nothing would move after that. Went through the ordeal of contacting customer service - which advised taking it to one of their local repair shops. The one they specified is one with a great reputaion in our area. After two weeks they told me that the parts were back ordered through Fuji and not available in the US. Weeks went by and no parts. The first of November I requested that the camera be replaced instead of repaired. As of the 9th of December still no word. I have owned this camera for three months and except for two weeks it hasn't been operational. It doesnt't matter how good a product is, things occasionally go wrong, and if there aren't repair parts avavilable or a company willing to stand behind their products - the quality doesn't mean squat. Not only do I not recommend this particular camera, but I will never buy a product from Fuji again.", "Date": "December 9, 2001"}, {"Title": "I'm addicted!", "Author": "Mary", "ReviewID": "R1QA675PYQAGZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous digital experience was with a cheapie that I found to be absolutely worthless--still I had a need for occasional \"instant photos\".  So I read several online reviews and once I saw samples from the Fujifilm Finepix 2400, I was really impressed!  Even better, it was the most affordable digital camera offering this resolution--as of December 2000.My intended use was really for \"throw-away\" or temporary stuff, (i.e. no baby pictures,) but the quality turned out to be so good, and the camera interfaced so well and so fast with my Blue & White Apple G3, that I quickly became addicted to this camera.There's a lot to be said for the instant gratification you get with digital:  1. You see the photo appear instantly on the small LCD screen on the back so you know right away if the shot is good or not.  2.  No waiting for the film developing.  If you're near your computer, you can view the full-size results immediately.And as for archiving and trading--now I can burn a CD with up to hundreds of hi-quality photos from this camera for about 2 bucks (plus whatever electricity costs in California these days!) That's a big savings over double/triple prints I had to buy so the grandparents could get copies.  Now I just send them a CD.If you're not a pro, and you're not going to blow up your photos for poster size prints, I can't imagine why you'd need to spend twice the price for a 3-4 megapixel camera, because this one will suit you just fine.My accessories of choice: Nice little case to protect camera, with a little storage.  NiMh battery charger with two sets of NiMH AA batteries (compare prices--these are now easy to find in drug/department stores), one set in the camera, one set in the case for back-up.  Of course you'll want to collect a few SmartMedia cards--pick 'em up as you find them on sale.", "Date": "March 16, 2001"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R31C9OJ2GOWB26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera for Christmas and I think it's great! I bought 4 rechargeable NiMH batteries, a 32 MB card and an ac adapter as recommended by reviews I had read. I was able to start taking pictures as soon as I took the camera out of the box and it took me only about 5 minutes to install the software on my computer and start viewing the pics. My only other experience with digital photography was using two different models of the Sony Mavica. I found my Fuji 2400 Zoom to be much easier to use and the pictures are clearer (although that could just be because I never really figured out how to set the Mavicas properly). I don't have a photo printer at the moment so I don't know what the printed photos look like. Most of the digital images I've taken have been very sharp especially outdoors with good light levels. Nighttime shots are another matter altogether. I have been unsuccessful in taking scenery shots at low light levels. However, I was never able to do this with my point and shoot regular camera. This is not a camera for professional photographers or even aspiring photographers; this is a camera for those who just want to remember their vacations, birthday parties and everyday events. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this camera, especially since it only costs about ($).", "Date": "February 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected!", "Author": "\"theprofromdover\"", "ReviewID": "RRA2NL7XBA4W5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The reviews were good, but the pictures are even better than advertised!  This compact, handy little camera takes absolutely great shots for the amateur or first-time digitaller.  I've used several Mavicas, and the 2400 is much better.  Colors are rich and details are sharp.  Quality is especially good in well lit situations:  outdoors, or brightly lit rooms.  The flash works okay, but is prone to red-eye, although the red-eye reduction works moderately well.  Battery life is excellent.  We spent a week at Disney World, took 130 shots, mostly with the LCD display on and many with flash, without having to change batteries (NiMH, 1600mAH, Rayovac).  My 64MB smartcard will hold about 160 pictures at 2 megapixel with \"normal\" JPEG compression (half that at the camera's best resolution).  Even the 8MB card that ships with the camera will hold a respectable 20 shots.  The camera is surprisingly rugged - it's even survived a bounce off a hardwood floor administered by my 2yr old.  My biggest complaints are that the LCD display is pretty much useless in the dark or in bright sunlight (the optical viewfinder works very well though), and the delay time between depressing the shutter button and when the picture is recorded is disconcertingly large, making it difficult to catch a moving target.  The software loading was very easy, and transferring pictures to my iMac via USB is a snap.  I was disappointed that the PhotoDeluxe software which shipped with the unit was only for Windows, but the viewer for the MAC isn't bad.  Altogether an extremely good value.", "Date": "May 15, 2001"}, {"Title": "FinePix 2400: Much better than expected", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2FZ539EAJ2HOA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera. I had mostly been using a 35mm SLR and occaisionally a compact 35mm previously. I thought it was a great deal, so I joined the digital photography era. I have been extremely satisfied with the camera. For the price, I did not expect it to compare with my SLR. Many of the pictures I have taken, however, are comparable. The quality of the images are truly amazing to me. The auto flash and focus function as well as any compact SLR I have had. Compared to other digital cameras I have been exposed to (family and friends) the camera is quick to boot up and respond to pushing the shutter. The software that comes with it is not perfect, but I found it very easy to use. I am still trying to get an AC adapter for it. I have been using rechargable batteries and they last a reasonable period of time. With a 64MB card, I have taken 177 high quality pictures and down loaded them through the USB cable in about 6 minutes. For those who don't want to spend much for compact 35mm equivalent that is easy to carry and use and can take great pictures, I think this is a good choice.Since I wrote my original review 8 months ago, I have had a problem with the lens protector continueously shutting the camera down and had to send it for repair. This took over one month and the camera still tends to shut down if the lens protector is moved even slighly. Also, I have noticed that pictures taken in a low light setting (with flash, of course) are frequently out of focus. Pictures taken in bright light are very sharp. I have reduced my rating from 4 to 3 stars.", "Date": "February 4, 2001"}, {"Title": "Best value around - the trick with selecting your camera.", "Author": "\"jubalharshaw\"", "ReviewID": "R1MA1E0HCSHJKU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for 10 months, and have taken it all over the world. I continue to be very pleased with the performance, and amazed at the picture quality. I was a professional photographer for some years, and so I was not expecting such good quality from a mid-range \"point and shoot\" camera.I have heard a lot of nonsense spoken about digital cameras, especially that \"you need the most megapixels you can get\". This is simply not true. The Fuji is a 2.1 Mpixel unit, meaning that you can take pics from 640x480 up to 1600x1200 pixels. More pixels does NOT mean a sharper picture - it means a bigger picture, both on screen and on paper when you print it. However, a big reason that people use digital cameras is so that they can email pics to loved ones. A 1600x1200 pic in fine mode runs out at 760 kb - about the biggest size you would want to try to email. Personally, I use 1280x960 in normal mode, which uses about 310 kb per pic. (A 640x480 pic is 90 kb). The supplied 8mb memory card holds about 24 pics at 1280x960. I bought a 32mb Viking card ... which holds 99 of these pics, and it works great. The 1280x960 resolution gives me a letter sized print (8.5\"x11\") with good quality. How much bigger does anyone need to go? You only need more megapixels if you are a pro photographer or if you plan to print out poster sized prints all of the time.The optical zoom works very well on the Fuji, but you should use the LCD screen to compose - the viewfinder is not completely accurate. (You get more picture on the left side than the viewfinder shows). The slow synch flash setting that is available is not a common feature on cameras at this price, but is superb for taking night time pics where you want the subject (e.g. your loved one) lit by flash, while also getting the background (e.g. city lights) properly exposed.All in all I am extremely pleased with this product. I bought a top of the line Sony 3 years ago, and the Fuji blows it away.

I didn't expect that to happen, as I tend to turn my nose up at point-and-shoots, but this camera rocks.  It's a joy to play with as soon as you open the package.  Slide film might still have an edge on resolution, but hey, instant digital is instant digital - no wait, no fuss, and no distortions in contrast, scratches, dust inside the body, or what-have-you that unavoidably occur in developing prints.The downsides are several but all relatively minor.  First, it won't completely replace your SLR. The FinePix 2400 has a reasonable amount of added manual control which is nice for us tweakers, but it's slightly cumbersome to navigate menus and buttons, compared to most automatic SLRs that you have familiarity with and which have far more versatility for fixing the lighting and other problems another reviewer mentioned.  (Still, I've gotten some great photos of lit up buildings at night with some slight tweaking!)  Second, the viewfinder is a pain for people like me whose left eye is better than our right;  I find myself constantly wiping nose smudges off the digital viewscreen and hoping I don't scratch the latter.  Third, the viewfinder doesn't correspond as well as it should to the real frame of the photo--I keep thinking I've got the perfect composition only to find out the field of view on the actual photo is larger than I expected.  You move closer and hope, a bit.  Fourth, if you're sometimes impatient with the zoom, like I am, it occasionally goes a bit loopy in extending and retracting until you turn it off and/or shut the lens cover.  Fifth, as everyone else says, it eats batteries voraciously, particularly if you use the digital viewing screen in its \"movie camera viewing mode\" (I always turn it off completely except to view photos);  a rechargeable adapter of some kind is necessary and on my shopping list.  Sixth, get at least a 32 MB or bigger flash card.  8MB is not enough;  128MB will keep you more than happy.That said, I haven't needed a tripod with this camera.  It's been remarkably steady even with low-light indoors or outdoors, but  one can't hurt, especially not my ultra-compact plastic mini-tripod.  Plus, unlike other reviewers, I wouldn't want more annoying questions than the existing two stages standing between me and deleting photos.  No bigger than most point and shoots, the FinePix 2400 is nicely compact and its photo quality is such that I more often than not end up leaving my SLR at home, just to save weight and bulk and avoid attracting too much attention with expensive gadgets while roaming about Eastern Europe (unless I know I need the SLR for the perfect picture).  The software bundle is also a plus--although the included Adobe version is rather stripped down, it does fine in basic, necessary touch-ups of digital or scanned film. You can adjust color balance, do continuous shots, and all sorts of other nifty things with the FinePix 2400, but the basic point-and-shoot operation is easy and results are high quality!", "Date": "August 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "A great little all rounder", "Author": "S Smyth", "ReviewID": "R33BHCEW6HG7TF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a neat and very handy little point and shoot digital with sufficient resolution for any web stuff, and useable prints.

This software by Adobe is about a hundred bucks and will let you do some great things that are way beyond the scope of the included bundle. Think of it as your digital darkroom; - a priority purchase.An A.C. adaptor, and rechargeable batteries including a charger, are a must to avoid spending a fortune on batteries. You could also consider making up a battery-pack by using a  battery holder, D-Cells, and a power cord that plugs in where the A.C. adaptor would normally go: the larger size cells lasting a great deal longer than the AAs.Definitely get a tripod.

I am a hobby photographer with a fairly expensive and extensive 35mm SLR gear which I still use a lot, but for the family-type snaps and when I really want to travel light, the 2400 is all I take. It takes really good pictures in most situations, and it is dead easy to handle. It is also small enough that you really do take it with you most anywhere. The lens seem very sharp and the exposure is right on most of the time. It does eat batteries, but that is not a problem if you get rechargeable ones. It is completeley manual with very limited ways for you to affect it manually. Shutter lag and focus lag is a bit slow, but something you get with this kind of camera. There is no way that I know of to mount a filter in front of the lens, but that is something most people would not miss. In bright outdoors light and in dark situations it is hard to impossible to see what is on the LCD, but then you always have the viewfinder. The problem with the viewfinder is that it doesn't show everything that will be on the photo you take (only 80% or so?). Buy a bag to keep the 2400 in (I got a LowePro bag to hang on my belt). Get some rechargeable AA batteries (I have 12). Get some memory (buy 64mb or 128mb cards). And as with any camera, using a tripod will increase the likelihood of you getting a sharp picture. Get a small tabletop tripod that you carry with you - it will give you better pictures.  I cannot really say anything about the quality of prints from the 2400 since I hardly ever print any of my snaps, but judging from the few prints I've made, I'd say you can print up to 8x10 from most frames (if you shoot at 1600x1200 with little compression) with good quality.", "Date": "February 25, 2002"}, {"Title": "If it breaks, good luck!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3HFBNUFU4DGFT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera may be okay but if it breaks you will be in trouble.

I recently had the opportunity to play with one for a while and I was impressed with what I saw. It's a well thought out design, still a good value, and an excellent example of technological evolution.More than just a higher-resolution version of the 1400, the Finepix 2400 is an evolutionary successor that builds on the features of the 1400. The ergonomics that made the 1400 easy to use are still there, but the resolution is doubled, and there's a lot more manual control available- something I find myself missing in the 1400. While the automatic mode produces fine exposures, photographers used to the flexibility of a manual camera will find much to like here.  There's more exposure control, a new color balance control, and a sequence shooting capability that should please sports fans. All this for a price not much higher than that of the 1400 a year ago.There are a few downsides. Shooters with a dominant left eye will find the optical viewfinder hard to use as their noses will tend to get in the way. The supplied 8MB Smart Card is far too small; you'll need a 32MB or preferably a 64MB card to take advantage of the camera's capability. Luckily the price of memory has plummeted over the past year, so that's no real drawback.In short, this is a reasonably priced camera with good resolution and good optics that's suitible for the novice or the experienced photographer.

It is way too easy to Format (Initailize) the Smart Media card, which will erase all stored and protected images.  Unfortunately, I let a friend play around with the camera and he did just that - erased everything, by selecting Format.  It did ask him if it was \"OK\", confirming what he was about to do, but if you're not careful, you'll be deleting your vacation.All in all, so far I'm happy with the purchase", "Date": "August 13, 2001"}, {"Title": "Attention Mac users...GREAT CAMERA!", "Author": "Ellie Lacosa", "ReviewID": "RDTE7UIN6VFQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera and I own a little 233 iMac. I shoppped the heck out of the available cameras that were Mac friendly and finally bought this one. I expected web post quality pictures only, but what I got were sharp, colorful and well saturated photos worthy of printing. The computer set up was simple. I snapped my first test shots, downloaded them to my computer via USB and had them on my desktop within 5-10 minutes ready to send to the grandparents.The quality of the camera itself is high. I handled other models before buying this one and some of them were a bit cheesy/cheap in construction. This feels like a well made point and shoot and the pictures are superb.

Quality pictures, good autonomy on batteries, and ease of transfer of pictures to Mac or PC were strong points. Only gripes were slow start-up process, and a complex self-standby mode (after a few minutes without use) that makes it necessary to re-start completely (close hood, switch off, open hood, switch on). MAJOR problem: it is very fragile (don't know about competition on this, but obviously not perceived as an issue by reviewers or editors..?), and no protective case supplied. It got knocked in a padded bag, and this split open the front cover (holding on a few flimsy screws) and split a major internal circuit. $150 to replace the part, plus labor! Peeping inside, it is just a stack of printed circuits stretching to the very edge of the housing, any knock will probably disable the product. The weight of 4 AA cells in this light case probably does not help either.

First of all, the battery life is much better than I had expected for an optical zoom camera.  That alone made me very happy.  The pictures are acceptable at 2 Megs and as long as you aren't looking for perfection, they are good enough for most applications.  Finally, it is relatively small and light and easy to carry around.Drawbacks, the software included isn't intuitive at all.  I wasn't even sure if I had installed the correct program.
