When these cameras work, the picture is fantastic and the varifocal lens is a great feature.  However, I haven't had one of these camera's last more than 5 months, the shortest being 3 weeks!In the last year, 7 (yes 7) have failed on me.  6 burned up (no picture) and 1 only shows a picture at dusk or dawn (white picture during the day, black at night).  For me, they last about 3-5 months, then it's off to the retailer for warranty repair/replacement.  It disappears 5-6 months, until I get a replacement.I have 2 other KT&C; cameras that are 12 VDC and lower resolution that have worked 4+ years flawlessly.  That was a big factor in why I chose this Hi-Res camera from KT&C.;  I'm disappointed these keep breaking on me.  When the 7th camera broke, I requested the 12 VDC version of the camera (since I've had much better luck with 12 VDC cameras; KT&C; and other brands).  When I received the 12VDC version, I immediately noticed a picture quality difference (poorer quality), then 3 weeks later I noticed this 12 VDC version (mounted outside) displaying a white picture during the day, all black at night...except for 1/2 hour at dusk and dawn where the picture was fairly normal.Repair/replacement service is slow.  Not the retailer's fault based on what they tell me. I'm in possession of one working camera, and the other 2 are in for warranty service. One has been out since July.When camera #7 failed this September, I took the opportunity to install a CNB-B2760N6 camera (Chinese made, purchased from Tech Tool Supply).  So far, it has a very good picture, but no the varifocal lens.  The price is right though (less than $100).  It's too soon comment on its durability compared to the Korean made KT&C; camera...although the bar hasn't been set very high.This would be a 5 star camera if it didn't keep breaking.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003KVAJS4"}}
