I researched several different cameras and just sort of happened upon this one.  Am I glad that I \"risked\" it! Since this is a new camera, there weren't many reviews.  I highly recommend checking out dcresource.com['s] review; it was what ultimately swayed me. I compared pics from the H5 to Canon's EOS REBEL XT DSLR with Lens kit, and honestly couldn't see much difference.  Yes, the Rebel has less noise at higher ISO settings, but since I am mainly a hobbyist, I'd say it won't be a problem. The Sony software isn't the world's best by any means, but the camera takes such great pics, you really don't need anything other than a photo organizer.  I am truly amazed at the camera's abilities.  The price is way way better than DSLRs, and for the prosumer, the H5 has just about everything you would need.The only Cons I've come up with are:-No RAW capabilities for the serious prosumer (I could care less, but I think my husband was a little disappointed.)-The memory is pretty expensive, but you can catch really good deals.So far, those are the only cons I can dredge up.Overall, the H5 makes me feel like a much better photographer than I actually am.  I am probably as close to a beginner as you can get (My last digital camera was bought in 1999).  I posted some pics above, so check them out, if you want to see some examples of what the camera is capable of.", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera for Anyone", "Author": "amazon customer", "ReviewID": "R3QUQG6OBEV5MR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now had this camera for over two weeks and have already taken almost 700 pics!  It has something for everyone. The color is true to life and there are no flaws in its pictures besides the occasional purple fringing in bright shots and some noise at ISO's above 400.  The flash is extremely powerful and actually enhances color, not bleaching out shots or causing red eye like other cameras.  You can go all of the way out to 12x zoom, and because of the image stabilization, you can still take shots without any blur.  I did find that the autofocus light is intimidating to people and causes them to look away, so you should turn that off and put up with slightly slower focus speeds.  Th camera fits very well in my hand, with a great rubber grip and a handy adjustment wheel below the shutter button.  When I was shopping for this camera, I had a tough time choosing between this camera and the Canon S3 IS.  They are direct competitors, and I found that the only way to decide between them was to see them and actually use them at the store.  Either one is a fantastic piece of hardware and the only real things that should influence your purchase are how you like the camera's feel and what kind of lcd you like.  The canon has an lcd that can be positioned at any angle, which is nice, but the sony has a huge, beautiful 3 incher that is pretty much the most impressive one that I have seen on a camera.  You'll get a lot of oohs and ahhs with the Sony.  I ended up getting the sony because I liked the way it fitted in my hand better than the Canon. I also like to have a cooler looking camera.  For additional research besides amazon reviews, I used dpreview.com and of course, cnet.com.  I hope this review helped people figure out which camera they should buy.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superb, crisp photos are only the beginning", "Author": "science gal", "ReviewID": "R1ESL8MB83WOHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A word about the reviewer:I am an amateur photographer who was interested in \"stepping up\" from a simple point and shoot.  In particular, I wanted a camera with greater than a 3X optical zoom (better for nature photography) and an above average level of resolution.  My husband is a serious hobbyist - he was interested in having a backup camera, or one that could easily be taken hiking without having to bring along the LARGE dSLR and the lenses.  When American Photo picked this camera as its Editor's Choice in the Superzoom EVF category we decided to check it out.  I am so very glad we did. This review will focus on comments not covered by other reviewers.CONS:1. Short battery lifeThis camera comes with a set of 2 rechargable batteries.  However, it will suck through them quickly; approximately 100-200 pictures. I HIGHLY suggest that you purchase an extra set of batteries and keep them charged and with you.  I always have the backup set in my pocket when we head out with the camera.2.  Shutter lagI find it difficult to take high quality action shots (e.g., kid's soccer games)with this camera due to the shutter lag.  It is better than other point and shoot digitals, but not the caliber of the Nikon D100.  But then again, this camera cost ~$1000 less.  If you are taking landscapes, still life or portraits this is not a problem.  Interestingly, has not been a problem with wildlife photorgraphy either.  Go figure.Pros:There are too many pros to cover them all, so here is a sampling1.  12X optical zoomIf you, like me, are moving up from the 3x optical zooms, you will NEVER go back once you try this camera.  Clear, crisp photos, with the equivalent of a 432 mm focal length will change your photography world.2.  Steady Shot image stabilizerIf you want to use that 12X optical zoom without your images being blurry you will need a tripod or a camera with a superb image stablizer.  The H5's image stablizer delivers very consistent, sharp images.  I have attached a few images - none were taken with a tripod.  Please check out the photo of a squirrel shot with full zoom and no tripod- he is crisp and sharp.3.  Relatively small sizeNo, you can't stick this camera in your pocket.  However, it easily straps across a shoulder and only weighs a few ounces.  I can hike or bike with it and not notice it.  Try doing that with a bulky SLR! 4.  Easy to handleI find this camera to be very ergodynamic - it just feels right in your hand.  All controls are well placed and with the \"virtual dial\" that appears in the view finder or monitor means you don't have to take your eye of the subject when you change settings.  Futher, the settings are very intuitive and easy to learn.  With this camera, I have learned how to adjust shutter speeds and apertures to improve my photographs.5.  Superb, crisp photosThis camera takes excellent photos in its point and shoot (automatic) mode, but also has several specialized modes (macro, landscape, portrait, sport, etc) to fine tune your photo quality.  In addition, it is so easy to take charge of the camera in regards to shutter speed, apeture, etc, you can \"dial-in\" the photos even more. It's easy.Summary:  for a beginner looking to advance or the serious hobbyist, this camera is a wonder.  For significantly less than the cost of a digital SLR, you can have a camera which will do ~80% of its functions. In short, this camera has helped me to become a better photographer.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Image Quality Trumps All Else", "Author": "Bookman", "ReviewID": "R23UZD3C5ARMKE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are several things I don't like about this camera, and I'll get to them in a bit.  But first things first: This is the big-zoom prosumer camera to buy.  Check out the photo comparisons between the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H5 and the Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 on the net at steves-digicams.  Among other things, at every ISO setting above 100, noise is noticeably worse in the Canon S3 than the Sony H-5.  If image quality is your top priority, look no further than this camera.  The comparison photos at steves-digicams and other sites should convince you.I've had my Sony H-5 for three weeks.  I've taken about six hundred pictures with it.  And except for the strange effect of TV lights (at a televised dog show) on my Auto WB, everything about my photos--the saturation, hues, brightness, contrast, and sharpness--has been excellent.  I don't even bother \"cleaning them up\" with Photoshop levels.  They're ready for printing, slide-shows on my TV, desktops, and screen-saving just as they are, unprocessed.  Even at ISO 400, noise is virtually unnoticeable when I view them on my 19-inch LCD computer monitor.More good news...  With the Sony rechargeable batteries that came with the H-5, I took over 400 throw-away pictures (I didn't count these in the 600 I mentioned before; I was trying to run-down the batteries to see how long they'd last, so I just sat and snapped pix of nothing while I watched TV).  I took at least one-third of them with one flash setting or another.  I finally got so fed-up with how long it was taking to wear-down the batteries that I did everything I could to speed-up the process--continuous AF, brighten the LCD screen and EVF, all photos with flash.  I kept snapping pix.  Then I turned-on the camera's perpetual \"slide-show\" and put the camera down.  Forty-five minutes later the batteries finally gave out.  And then for thirty bucks at Costco I bought a 15-minute rapid-charger with three pairs of batteries and a car-adapter.  I don't worry about battery life.The LCD screen on the H-5 is actually useful for framing.  My old Konica Minolta DiMage Z1 had a 1.8-inch screen that I never used for picture-taking because it was so small.  Now, I don't have to take all my pix with the EVF.  A good thing, as I'll note later on.The image-stabilizer has been all I could've wished for.  I can consistently take crystal-clear hand-held shots at 1/40 sec.  I've even taken several beauties at much lower speeds--all the way down to 1/15.  This is quite a boon for someone like me who shoots on P, A, S, or M (98% P) and prefers not to use the flash for indoor photography.I was impressed by the Sony H-5's ability to focus rather quickly in low light.  (My DiMage Z1 never focussed at all in low light.)  Even the H-5's manual focus, while awkward to use, was nevertheless 100% accurate.The excellent low-light AF, the image-stabilizer, and the large LCD screen make shooting flashless indoors a pleasure and not a gamble.Now the bad news...Unless the lens hood is attached, the lens cap attaches to the camera body.  It's a good-news/bad-news thing.  The lens cap doesn't pop-off by accident--a good thing.  But it causes two annoyances.  First, the camera won't fully start up in capture modes with the lens cap on.  Turning the camera on first is like not turning it on at all, for capture purposes, because even with the camera \"on\" nothing happens--no lens barrel extension, no menu--until you remove the lens cap.  Second, unless you have the lens hood attached, you can't reattach the lens cap while the camera is still \"on.\"  You have to walk around with the lens exposed or turn the camera off.  In a hurry, it's quicker to remove a lens cap and take a picture than it is to remove a lens cap, turn on the camera, wait a couple of seconds for start-up to be completed, and then take your picture.  Tip: When you aren't taking up-close photos in macro mode, put the lens hood on and keep it on.  You can attach the lens cap directly to the end of the lens hood while the camera is \"on\" and the lens barrel extended.  This is the only way I know how to walk around with the Sony H-5 \"on\" and keep the lens protected.The EVF has serious parallax (or parallax-like) error.  I took a vertical photo of a lamp post in Portland's Chinatown.  It looked something like a big red metallic saguaro cactus.  In the EVF, I had the entire lamp post in the frame.  When I got home, the top half of the lights were cut off.  Tip: When you frame with this camera's EVF, give yourself more room on the margins than you'd want in your print.The camera doesn't come with a Memory Stick Pro Duo reader that can be plugged directly into a USB port.  Instead, to download pix you have to connect the camera to your computer via the provided cable, with your camera turned on--using battery power that should be saved for picture-taking.Every prosumer camera should have a dedicated ISO button.  This one doesn't.  Regardless of which camera you buy, you want to take every picture on the lowest ISO setting practicable.  You'll learn, with practice, the lowest shutter-speed you or AE can set which still lets you take a hand-held, jitter-free photo.  (My \"safe\" minimum is about 1/40.)  Without a dedicated ISO button, if you're at ISO 80 and you want to raise it to 100 or 200 to get a faster shutter-speed you have to go into the menu, raise the ISO setting to 100 or 200, leave the menu, push the shutter button half-way down to check the shutter-speed, and if necessary, go back into the menu and raise it to 200 or 400, etc.  (Switching from P to \"Auto\" won't raise the shutter-speed much, if at all, so I don't waste my time with that maneuver.)You can't review photos in capture modes.  You have to exit your capture mode by pushing the \"play\" button.  A minor inconvenience.Bottom Line:  Despite its \"cons,\" superior image quality makes the Sony DSC-H5 the big-zoom camera of choice.", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Among the best digital cameras in its price range and class", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "R1U5LOLOQ90CU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H5 is the largest, most expensive digital camera in its class, but it has more resolution than its competition (7.2 MP versus 6 MP for most of the others) and is ergonomically quite easy to use. The June, 2006 issue of Popular Photography has a brief, but glowing, review of this camera, praising its higher ISO limit (up to 1000 and with lower noise too apparently) and its image-stabilization feature, among the first found in a Sony digital camera. There's also an option to use the camera in macrophotography mode, focusing as close as three-quarters of an inch. Not surprisingly, the color resolution is quite good, thanks to its zoom Zeiss Vario-Tessar 36-432mm (35mm equivalent) lens.Users may find it a bit too big, and yet the controls are ergonomically easy to handle. There's also a built-in Function Guide which will explain all of the camera's features, yet another nice feature for anyone unfamiliar with cameras or photography. If there is a serious complaint to be made of this camera aside from its large size, then it is the fact that the MemoryStick Duo/PRO card can be a bit expensive to purchase. Others familiar with both RAW and TIFF digital imaging formats may not appreciate too that this camera only offers the .JPEG format. Without a doubt, Sony and Zeiss have collaborated superbly on making a splendid digital camera with more MP resolution than its competition.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best  Digital Camera there is", "Author": "Sunil N.

Before buying the camera I read lot of reviews. In most of the reviews Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 7.2MP Digital Camera was compared with Canon PowerShot S3 IS. To get the feel of Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 and Canon PowerShot S3 IS, I drove 90 miles to the nearest Circuitcity. I made up my mind after holding both the cameras in my hand. Believe me Canon PowerShot S3 IS is no match to Sony Cybershot DSC-H5. Canon PowerShot S3 IS appears like a cheap digital camera. After receiving my Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 I tried it both indoors and in natural light. I am very impressed with the performance of Sony Cybershot DSC-H5. The best thing about the camera is the Image Stabilization and the 3 inch screen. To prevent the screen from getting any scratches I have covered it with saran wrap film. I wish Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 camera had provision for external flash. With provision for external flash, this camera would be like a professional camera. All the same I love my Sony Cybershot DSC-H5.

The camera uses standard AA-size batteries instead of proprietary batteries (cost more and available only from manufacturer). The manuals consist of a \"Read This First\" brochure and a 120-page printed owners guide. Finally, the box includes software on CD, an A/V cable for connecting to a television, and a high-speed USB 2.0 cable.Sony did not include a memory card, opting instead for more memory (30MB usable) in the camera. But, like other cameras, plan on purchasing a memory card to hold more images. The camera accepts Memory Stick Duo, Memory Stick Pro Duo, and Memory Stick Pro Duo High Speed media. The high speed cards offer no speed advantage with this camera. These cards include an adapter making them compatible with virtually any card reader.The camera is mid-sized - larger than a pocket point & shoot, smaller than a DSLR. It seems fairly well built. The plastic body is neither unusually sturdy nor overly fragile. The doors over the battery and connector compartments also seem sturdy. The buttons are reasonably well placed for such a compact camera. Some are small and recessed into the body to prevent accidental operation, but my medium-sized fingers had no trouble operating them. All in all, there is nothing outstanding, nor anything particularly worrisome, about this camera's construction.The large, backlit, rear display is impressive. Images are sharp, while menus are easy to read. It can be difficult to see on a sunny day without shade, but the electronic viewfinder (EVF) works well in these conditions and includes everything shown on the larger display. A button switches between the EVF and rear display.The zoom range of this camera (36-432mm) is equally impressive, with images surprisingly sharp throughout the entire zoom range. The two-stage electronic zoom mechanism is brisk, requiring some practice to get precise control. Since even the slightest movement can blur an image at the largest telephoto setting of a super-zoom camera, an optical image stabilizer is important to correct for small movements of the camera (caused by breathing, shaky hands, or whatever). The results are sharper images with the benefit of hand-holding this camera in situations where other cameras without image stabilization might produce blurred images. The IS system in this camera is among the best I've seen in this price range.There are no surprises with picture quality. Images are sharp. Colors are accurate. Focus and exposure metering are spot on - even more so with spot metering and selectable metering zones. Lens aberrations (barrel distortion and edge blurriness) are virtually undetectable in \"real-world\" photos. Some image noise can be seen above ISO-400. For outstanding larger prints, I suggest staying below ISO-200 (pros will want to stay below ISO-100, just like the old days with film).Purple fringing can be seen in some images (around street lights, for example), but nearly all cameras in this class have this problem. It is caused by the small image sensor (CCD) used in these cameras, with manufacturers trying to wrestle every drop of resolution out of the sensors. Regardless, this camera no more prone to purple fringing then other 7+ megapixel cameras in this class. In fact, the images often contain no more purple fringing than images taken with lower resolution cameras, such as the Canon S3 IS. In the end, purple fringing is really not that important - appears only in limited circumstances, often not that objectionable when present, and can be removed entirely by most image editing software.With an ISO-100 guide number of roughly 29 (wide) - 22 (tele) feet, this camera has one of the strongest built-in flash units on the market in this camera category. Modes include off, auto, forced, slow sync, auto daylight sync, front and rear curtain sync, red-eye reduction, and manual compensation of +/- 2.0 EV in 1/3 EV steps. Recycling times appear roughly in the 8-10 second range, but the flash rarely requires full power or recycling times. The flash is powerful enough to work well with softening attachments, such as screens or socks.The Sony 0.7x wide angle and 1.7x telephoto conversion lenses are fun to use. These screw onto the lens adapter (included) and increase zoom coverage from about 25mm to about 734mm. The high-quality optics keep images reasonably sharp throughout the entire zoom range. Lenses are also available from other manufacturers, offering even wide angle coverage (for example). The adapter also accepts standard 58mm filters, including polarizer, third-party close-up, and creative filters.Like most digital cameras (and perhaps worse than some), the H5 goes through batteries like there is no tomorrow. So, if you plan to use that large display a lot (or the flash, or both), make sure to have plenty of spare batteries on hand. With a full day of shooting, expect to go through a set or two of rechargeable batteries. If spare batteries are limited, take steps to reduce battery drain - such as using the EVF for taking pictures, with the LCD used only for reviewing images afterwards.I shopped carefully before buying this camera, narrowing the list down to just a few - this camera, the Canon S3 IS (6 megapixels or 1.2 million pixels less - among lowest in this camera category, poor construction including plastic tripod mount), the Fuji FinePix S9000 (larger, no image stabilization, sluggish), the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ30 (larger, proprietary batteries, image noise), and the Samsung Digimax Pro 815 (no image stabilization, proprietary batteries). Even with the issues noted, any of these would still be a fine choice. But the combined features of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H5 ultimately make it the best choice in this camera category (compact super-zooms).", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a  serious flaw", "Author": "Daiho", "ReviewID": "R2QH0VZP5ZC2WL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 is my second digital camera, a huge step up from the simple point and click Nikon that I bought five years ago.  Like that camera, you can use the Cybershot in a fully automated mode right out of the box.  But what makes this camera worth the money are the host of manual features you can use to explore more fully the possibilities in the photographic art. Switching back and forth between the two takes only a few minutes of studying the options interface.But BEWARE.It appears that there is a serious design flaw in the DSC-H5.  Two months after I bought it the automatic focus feature stopped working.  As designed, you push halfway on the shutter button to focus, then press fully to take your picture.  I was happily shooting away at a recent baseball game when I noticed that I could no longer hold the shutter halfway to focus.  After discharging the batteries, reinitializing the camera, and pouring through the manual for a solution, I began a search of the internet.  To my great disappointment I have found that several other consumers have had the identical same problem with the shutter button.  Some have had the problem fixed, only to have it resurface several hundred shots later.  See the forums (dsc-h5 autofocus problem) at Photography Review for more discussion of this issue.I'm still under warranty and sending my camera for repair next week.  I may sell it afterwards and move onto a new model, which I really hate to do.  This is in all other respects a wonderful camera.UPDATE 08 June 2007:  Sony sent a courier with a self-addressed padded box and the camera left home within moments.  The local service center called the next afternoon to say repairs had been completed and the camera arrived by courier the next afternoon.  According to the service invoice, the switch block was replaced.  As the camera is still under warranty, all shipping, parts and labor was covered by Sony. I have so far shot only a couple of photos to test that the autofocus is now working.

Now all remaining 3 has very good reviews and some of my expert friend told me that you will not go wrong with any of these camera. Out of these three H5 is costliest one and DMC-FZ7 is the cheapest one. Below are the reason why I went for DSC-H5.1) S3 IS has 2\" LCD and FZ7 has 2.5\" LCD. Both this camera has very low resolution on LCD. DSC-H5 has 3\" bright higher resolution LCD. That was major plus point for me. All these tree cameras take nice pictures but with DSC-H5 you can see immidietly on screen, while for others you have to transfer pics to PC.2) DMC-FZ7's body and design is not eye catching and it's plastic body feels very cheap. It weight is also around 300gm. While S3 IS and DSC-H5 weights around 500 gm. I am six foot giant with big hands. So DMC-FZ7 was giving me very cheap feeling in my hand. So I eliminated that too.3) S3 IS uses 4 AA batteries and DSC-H5 uses 2 AA batteries. They also provide  2 x 2500 mAH batteries and a charger with camera. Plus they also provide lens hood, lens caps, adapter ring with camera. S3 IS doesn't come with any of this.4) I was mainly looking for better point and shoot capability. No doubt S3 Is has more features then DSC-H5, but just for point and shoot DSC-H5 is better then S3 IS.These are the plus points, but major minus point is H5 is the slowest of all. FZ7 is the fastest. S3 IS is fast too and both has good shutter speed also.I hope this comparision will help you guys for buying.Regards.", "Date": "February 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic camera, but.....", "Author": "Santanu Roy", "ReviewID": "R1MG1TLERV4O82", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony DSC-H5 is a great camera. Specially for the people who love long range optical zoom features like me. Its 12X optical zoom lens is really really incredible. With minimum distorions, long distance photography with it is really an adventure.One of its great features is that, while shooting movies you can still use the zooming feature. This is quite handy since you can go upto 57X zoom in vga mode.The Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization system is amazing. I have taken a picture of the Moon on a full moon night with full 12X zoom and full manual controls without using a tripod, thanks to the Image Stabilization system.The large 3 inch LCD display is very useful. Its easy to see all the details of a picture while shooting and while previewing also.The manual white balance adjustment works fine. The 'SET' feature adjusts the white balance automatically according to your own background. In general, the camera offers great manual controls.Now let me tell you why I gave the camera one less than a 5 star.1. The most lacking feature is an Accessory Shoe. I am really suprised why 'Sony' did not think of it.2. Another lacking feature is the \"RAW\" capture mode. This would have been very handy.3. You cannot set the Image Quality at 6 MP or 4 MP. It has to be either 7 MP or 5 MP or less then 4 MP. Options for 6 MP and 4 MP would have helped as these are very common settings. However, I do not know whether there is any technical limitation.4. The manual focus feature needs improvement, though using the Peaking feature helps a little.In conclusion the Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 7.2MP Digital Camera is a great camera and I would surely recommend it to an amateur or a serious amateur or a hobbyist who cannot afford a DSLR.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera", "Author": "C.

Don't just look at the number of MP, the quality is what you need!!!- Handles red-eye well...  Yes, I have taken red-eye shots, but the number of red-eye shots is less than other cameras- The picture preview is a separate button (no need to turn the dial).  You can also turn the camera on with this button.- Uses rechargeable AA batteries.  This could be a negative because the battery life is less than other rechargeables, however you can easily pick-up AA batteries anywhere, so this is a positive.Negatives:- Pop-up flash takes a while to recharge.  Not good if you need a quick second shot.- The camera is actually smaller than expected. Some may consider this a positive, but I would actually prefer a slightly larger camera to more comfortably get my hands around it.- The view finder is awkward.

I looked at all of the recomendations on amazon and decided to get a cannon powershot or the sony cybershot. My first choice wasthe cannon, its was fast, 8 megapixals and had good reports, when I bought it at circus city, it appeared a little flimsy, but it was super fast! It also took fantastic video, better than all the others I tried, but I wanted a camera that could take good clear pics. When I took it home, I immediatly took many pics of the children, playing, running and several still shots. When I down loaded then,  was very disapointed! Over half of the pics were blurred, even when I put the dial on the sport mode, I had blurred pics. On the still pics, I commonly had grainy looks, especially indoors. I tried every mode and took many pics to get the best shots, and I often came up disapointed. I returned it and purchased a sony cybershot H5. BOY what a difference! Thesuper steady shot works very well, even when I zoom far away and take pics they rarely blur! When I down loaded the pics and cratiqued them, they were much clearer and sharper than the cannon, the difference was like night and day. I rarely get blurred shots and they look like a real pro took them. When you take micro shots of flowers it really looks beautiful. I get raves all the time with my sony, I wouldnt trade it for anything. It is slower then the cannon and the rechargable batteries dont last long, so I just buy the lithium batteries and they least several hundred pics.The screen is bright, and the camera is easy to use, but the video is choppy, not as good as the canon, but I got it mainly for pics.f you want a camera that takes awesome pics with the best image stableizer on the market, get the sony. After I bought my sony, I did a week later go to walmart and saw a sony h5 next to the cannon on display, I just for kicks took them both and took pics of the same idems in the store. As I was doing that, I ask the sales lady which camera takes the best pics? She quickly said \"The cannon!\" \"Its the best on the market today and the specialize on cameras!\" I said lets see, then I showed her the pics on both cameras of the same objects at the same settings, and she said, \"Oh? I was wrong, the sony takes mush better pics!\" It was even morenoticeable when you zoomed the pics in close, the cannon always looked grainy with red spots, but the sony was clear as a bell!Im convinced now, the sony hs was the best pic for a midrange zoom camera.

My decision to buy the camera was based on reading reviews and using a good point and shoot camera for a day.  I was not sure what type of camera I should get.  My thought process was that if I like photography I would want more control over the camera than a point and shoot.  If I did not like controlling the camera, the automatic setting would be necessary. I wanted a high pixel rating so I could edit the pictures on my computer.  I also thought that I would like landscape photography and a high digital zoom would be important. The 3x zoom on the point and shoot was not adequate.  My intention was to use the view finder for focusing  but I thought that the larger the LCD the happier I would be with the camera. Thus, I ended up selecting this camera because of the 12x zoom and the large LCD.  I would have preferred a higher pixel rating.  The reason is I do not know if I will need it and I can not add it latter.  I would not have selected a camera with a lower pixel rating.I set price aside for my initial review of models, but I quickly learned that  SRL's were to expensive for my perceived needs.  Also, point and shoot were too limiting.  That left this class of cameras in-between.  The limited memory was not a problem because I assumed that I would want to buy additional memory for any camera I would get.  I went with 2g as I thought I would use the 7 mega pixels (you can use less, and the pictures still look very good) for most pictures and wanted to have room for pictures while on  vacation.I have been using the camera for several weeks. I am trying to learn all the features and what they mean for picture quality. At this point the camera meets my expectations.  The picture quality is great.  I did see reviews by several people complaining about the placement of the buttons. I also had a lot of trouble using them. Part of the problem was remembering which button did what. The other was learning how to place my hands on the camera in the areas were the buttons were not. I think this could be a problem with any camera and is just part of the learning curve. I could not recommend a button placement that would be better.

I settled on the H-5 after reading the reviews here and elsewhere and noting the specs ... while the manual focus still isn't precisely what I wanted, the amount of control is significantly better than my old camera and good for the price ... most importantly from my perspective, the camera survived Europe and held onto just about 300 shots on a 1 Gb memory stick until I got them back to my laptop -- I'm very pleased with the results:  color was excellent, focus was mostly good (and any unintented soft spots were due to my unfamiliarity with the camera, which I only received a day before we left) ... shutter speed was also quick under normal light conditions, which was refreshing.

If you Google my name with the correct spelling, you will figure out a way to view all my 1700 pictures. That should tell you if the camera is good or bad. Seeing is Believing !!![...]SHOOTING MODE:  I mostly used AUTO, APERTURE PRIORITY and ISO modes.Also I only used optical zoom. After 5X zoom or so you may need a tripod to zoom to the max (12X). Otherwise the pictures may turnout to be blurry. This Camera takes great pictures in AUTO mode. A slight pressure on the dial at the lower right hand side of the camera may put the Camera into Macro mode without you knowing about it. Every time I asked somebody else to take my picture, the Camera came back to me in Macro mode !. So watch out !.BATTERIES: There is really no definite estimation regarding the number of pictures you can take with  rechargeable batteries. With the  Sony rechargeable batteries (two) that came with the camera , I could shoot only about 70 pictures with  the LCD off. With the rechargeables from ENERGIZER, I could shoot about 150 with the LCD off. I also used disposable LITHIUM batteries which gave me 200 plus pictures with the LCD off. So depending on your schedule, make sure that you  carry a combination of these batteries. The Sony charger can not be used to charge batteries belonging to other brands and vice versa. Also it takes about 6 hours to charge batteries using the charger. When the batteries are charged, the light on the charger should turn itself off. However, this does not happen most of the time. Anyway, make sure that you charge the batteries atleast 6 hours.Overall, I am satisfied with the performance of this Camera.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Sony has camera potential, but a couple issues, too.", "Author": "M.

I bought the 707 the day it came out several years ago. Though it had issues, I loved that camera and shot more than 10K photos with it for business and pleasure. It went toes-up last spring, as Sony's (if you read Web reviews and boards, you'll know this) tend to do without warning.With trepidation, I bought the H5 after owning a Kodak for two days, and returning it because the refresh time was too freaking slow. I was making shots of my dog one day as he lay in the sun on the back of my couch. Before I could capture him with the Kodak, he wandered away. Nice shot of the couch.But I digress. The Sony is worthwhile - it has lots of good points and some drawbacks.Good:Nice resolution.Easy to figure out for the most part.Nice programs, if you use those, and a fair degree of flexibility.It shoots well in almost all light and allows aperture priority and manual operation.Focus is good.Lens is fantastic - Zeiss glass - huge.Recycle time is better than many, camera is less noisy than many.It's big enough to hold steady - I don't care for tiny camera \"jewelry\".Good picture stabilization.Good accessories come with it.You can be shooting very quickly after unpacking the camera, with very little reading of manuals, but you will want to read up on the robust features at some point.Awesome display - large and clear, even in sunlight.12X zoom - good one.Good video.The body styling looks professional and feels comfortable in your hand.Takes really phenominal pictures, beautiful - its overall saving grace.I don't like it as well as the 707. Here's why:The body is cheap, crappy-feeling plastic. I liked the metal of old.Batteries provide excrutiatingly unreliable performance in this camera for some reason.Sony customer support is nearly non-existant and God help you if the thing malfunctions - Sony disappears and pretends they never made a camera. Ask anyone.Controls are configured on the back so that if you are busy shooting, and intent on your task, you WILL accidently trigger something you didnt mean to trigger. You have to think about those controls every time you shoot. Bad design.I worry that the doors to inner compartments are going to have a limited life-expectancy.Inside the box you get:  *  The 7.2 effective Megapixel Cyber-shot DSC-H5 digital camera  * Two NiMH rechargeable AA batteries  * Battery charger --an unusual inclusion, probably because the batteries die quickly.  * Lens cap w/retaining strap  * Lens hood - nice feature  * Conversion lens adapter - allows addition of other lenses - fun feature.  * Wrist strap  * USB cable - again, unusual  * A/V cable  * CD-ROM with Sony Cyber-shot Viewer  * \"Read This FIrst\" guide + 120 page camera manualKeep in mind, I'm not a technician.

This camera makes about as good as you're going to get images for a consumer-grade camera and without spending the national debt. I paid near $800 for the 707 once upon a time. This one comes in under $400, well accessorized. It has onboard memory, but not much, so invest in a stick - the largest you can afford - and you're good to go.

We carried the camera throughout the trip and never used a tripod, but turned out over 1000 outstanding pics.The picture clarity is superb.  The anti-shake technology on the camera works very well under most circumstances.  The only times we had blurry images in the 1100 pics taken on the trip were when we zoomed in tight on an object in lower light situations with extended exposure.The batteries supplied with the camera (rechargables) lasted a considerable length of time.  Without the flash, we took close to 150 pics before swapping them.  Considering the camera is fed by 2 AA batteries, this was surprisingly good.  Regular AA batteries are good for about 40-60 pics depending on the camera settings (without flash).The flash is surprisingly strong.  This was the only thing we were worried about, as Steve's Digital Camera review listed this camera as having a below-average flash.  I was floored at the ability of the camera to produce outstanding pics at night at extended range.We took several movies on the trip, and the video is VCD quality video with great sound.  The zoom works (not digital zoom) great in video-mode, although the file sizes of the movies is a bit excessive.  A 58 second video was 15 MB.We purchased the wide-angle attachment lens, and were pleased, although you can see the edges of the lens hood in the corners of the pictures.  The zoom is limited to 2.5x with the wide-angle (or any attached) lens.The camera is sturdy, and feels substantial without being heavy.  The camera bag was dropped twice to my horror, but the camera was unaffected both times.We purchased a 1 GB and 4 GB card for the camera, without knowing if the camera would support the 4 GB card.  It did support it without any problem.The features of the camera were easy to use, and easy to get used to for a novice.  We took many low-light pics that turned out great using the manual settings of the camera.  We also were able to get outstanding high speed shots.  Several of our twilight/early evening shots taken in manual and without flash looked light daylight shots without blurriness.  The shutter speed is highly variable depending on the types of shots, and is sufficiently quick to take very good fast-action photos in rapid succession.The camera has several color selections ranging from black-and-white, sepia (my wife's favorite), vivid, normal, and bright.  The vivid and bright were almost indistinguishable from each other, and were excellent for taking shots that appeared 'better than real life.'  For instance, in the art museums, we took picks of Caravaggio (a very dark renaissance painter) and the images came out with great clarity and brightness that exceeded our visual acuity.The camera LCD has adjustable brightness to conserve battery, and also has a viewfinder.  Although, the viewfinder is not a traditional view through the lens, but simply a smaller screen showing the same thing as the LCD.  To some, this might be a turn-off, but for us, it was great.The only two things I was unhappy with were the camera strap that came with the camera was cheap, and uncomfortable, and accessing the pictures on the internal memory was very difficult without the Canon software.  It would be nice to have a feature to turn off internal memory, but none exists.  8MBs does little when you have a 4GB card installed.This camera has everything we wanted and more.  We were looking for a good sized LCD, AA-battery power, high capacity storage, quick image capture, and anti-shake capabilities.  I could not have been happier with this camera, and it has exceeded all the reviews I read when researching this camera.  I think this one would be hard to beat at this price, or even in cameras that cost hundreds more.Buy this camera!

It is not too bulky and my wife found it actually more comfertable to use than old small fuji350 or sony cybershot**Pictures : I just took some in house low light pictures. and as everyone reviewed noise level was little high but tolerable.  I took some pictures inside the BB with Image stabilisation and without the stabilisation and there was noticible improvement on the pictures.NOTE: since sony uses lance based stabilisation it will only help to avoid shakes from yourhand or camera. It will not hals to avoid blure if object is shaking. you need to use higher ISO to avoid it.

Practice can make you perfect on this.3. i think image stabilizer is more active when you do some zoom so evenif you dont need it do a little zoom b4 you take the picture and imagestabilisation make it less blure.4.as with all the camers night mode is not too much exciting so save your power avoid low light pictures.5.allways keep you exposer histogram on.. it will really help you to take good picture.****************** after few months *****************I am not happy with the low light pictures .... without flas. they are terribaly blure. rest I am happy with my choice.....", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superb picture quality, great flash, very little noise, great lens", "Author": "Lalelisi", "ReviewID": "R1F56Z447LIH74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few days ago after having had twice bad luck with purchasing other digital cameras (one was the new DLSR from SONY, the Alpha A100K, and one was the F31fd from Fuji, see my other reviews) and after having owned the SONY DSC-V1 for about 3-4 years. The A100K and the F31fd were both very disappointing in the picture quality, mainly the noise. Even under 'normal' (bright light) conditions there was visible noise in the white and in the colors. The F31fd was very poor while the A100K was better but still disappointing. Basically my old DSC-V1 did in the 'idiot-proof' shooting mode always better pictures than any of the other two cameras, even though I played with all possible settings like ISO, white balance, sharpness, etc. Anyway, I recently bought the H5 and I must say that the picture quality is *extremely good*, it is better than the V1 which was my reference so far, and it is clearly much better than the A100K, and we don't even mention the F31fd. The Carl Zeiss lens seems to be extremely good in combination with the CCD sensor, the pictures are really of great quality in all aspects, natural colors, sharpness with lots of details, very little noise - just perfect. The flash is great as well, very strong (long reach) but still giving the pictures a natural look, no overexposure. The zoom and the image stabilization are great as well, nothing to complain. I am *very happy* with this camera so far and I can only recommend it to everyone. The picture quality is really outstanding, and I have seen a lot pictures of other digital cameras from all of our friends. On the negative side, the zoom button is too close to the edge, same with the 'menu' button. So it happens that you sometimes accidentally press these buttons. But I guess it's a matter of getting used to the camera and knowing how to hold it. The camera is also very light but still seems to be have a good built.

After reading the quick guide I was taking some good shots which did not require much touch up. The control settings are pretty easy to use and the 12x zoom is sufficiant for most shots far away. My cousin is a professional photographer in Hollywood, Ca. and even he was impressive with the quality of pics and ease of use of this camera. The only negative that I would have to say about this camera is that the control buttons tend to be a litte small for big fingers.

I used to work as a part time photographer (in college), using up to 3 slr (film based) at a time, and I love the slr formats (and still use the film camera's on occasion).  But now, being more of a causal photographer, this thing does everything that the slr did (and more), much easier and more useful.  It does have a couple of foibles that one gets used to, such as the right thumb hold being too close to the zoom buttons, but one gets used to that.

You can see magenta fringes around the dark areas, especially around the edge of the frame. As far as I can tell, this happens regardless of the f-stop or zoom setting.So I returned the Sony and got a Canon S3 IS and I've been very happy with it. Although it has fewer megapixels and a smaller display, it seems to have a better lens. There is still a small amount of red fringing but it happens less frequently (at high zooms?) and is easier to remove (with red-eye tool believe it or not!) Nothing is perfect when packing so much capability into such a small package. But overall I decided that I preferred the ergonomics of the Canon as well, and the tilting display is a boon for shooting overhead or doing macro work.So if you want a cool display for viewing and reviewing pictures, buy the Sony.

I found a case that fits it exactly, with room for a Gorilla Pod at the bottom, and an extra set of batteries.This camera takes excellent movies! I was stunned when I saw the first movie I took, even though in a quiet movie the motor will come through as a humming. The sound of the movie, in the camera, isn't that great. A movie that I took of a chime choir sounded horrible on the camera, the high notes came in as a \"chang\"ing sound. On the computer, it sounded fine.Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera, who even though being rather outdated by today's standards, is still very good.", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible camera!

Basically anything electronic. It takes me weeks if not months of research, review reading, going and actually handling the item for me to decide then i still usually have a waiting period once i have found the item of 2 weeks.ALL of that being said, i did a lot of research into this camera, i was stepping up from a Sony DSC- S75. We travel a lot, move a lot and i take a LOT of pictures for family and i needed a good digital camera.This one works for me, i find it works even better once i educated myself on on the functions and learned how to use them, i find i DO much less editing now. Usually a re size (for uploading to websites) which necessitates a sharpening and that is usually it. Occasionally i will find i need to brighten a hair but that is usually due to my over adjusting something.This camera fits in a small back with my sony camcorder (yes you see a pattern :) I have taken it all over the united states, used it to record Christmas videos of family opening presents. You name it this camera has done it.The only \"issues\" i really have is if you have a zoom lens on or a wide angle lens they will block the pop up flash, HOWEVER i accidentally discovered this since you dont use the flash for zoom. I love the hood it comes with for shooting in sunlight.The screen is outstanding for review pictures. I use both the screen and the viewfinder to take pictures.The menu is easy to work, the settings are very user friendly. This has been a great camera and i have debated getting a DSLR camera but i just cant find one that has all the specs i require. BEFORE contemplating the DSLR i thought about upgrading to another digital camera and i could not find one that could compete with this one.One of the things i ACTUALLY love about this camera that most seem to have issue with is the double AA batteries. I have found with no flash, using the viewfinder i can take over 200 pictures before i need a charge. Using the flash and the viewfinder i have found cuts that down to between 85 and 120 depending on frequency of using the flash. HOWEVER the reason i really enjoy the double AA batteries is, i use my 1 set of rechargeable batteries first, then i carry 3 extra sets of double AA's this has lasted me from 9 am to 11 pm randomly shooting pictures while on vacation for 3 days. I shot pictures between those times daily for 3 days and that was all the batteries i needed. NOW the perk is, if you are OUT in the middle of nowhere without an outlet, you pull out double AAs and kep going. They are lighter than the bulky lithium batteries, take up less space, and if you forget your charger you are hosed, where as with the double AA they are everywhere.My Sony DSC S75 had the lithium battery and i was hesitant to get this camera because it DID NOT have that. BUT now i dont know if i would go back to a rechargeable lithium battery. I have since bought 2 more sets of rechargeable batteries and i am one happy picture taker :)THIS IS A GREAT camera for an amateur photographer, i have actually put my photos up against DSLR cameras and won a few times in contests. An expensive camera does not make a great photographer, learning how to USE a camera makes a great photographer.You will not regret buying this camera.My best advice is go to a store that sells electronics go to more than one, HANDLE the item you want to buy, write it down, go home check reviews, educate yourself on how to use it and you will ALWAYS be happy with your purchase.ADDED note i recently used this to take pictures of a Blue angels airshow WITHOUT a zoom lens, the image is in customer images on this page.*****UPDATE****** still using this camera, keep looking at DSLR and just cant give up this camera for those. This camera has great action setting and i just cant seem to get that with any DSLR i have found so far.

Despite it's bulkiness, this baby really really takes great pictures. Especially if you use it under manual, aperture or shutter priority setting. Trust me, it's not that hard to set up a good setting for certain situations to get a great shots .. i'm an amateur myself, but after about 2 years using this one, having to set up different modes and settings, and after seeing the result on the pics, oh boy .. i feel like i'm a pro :).It takes a really great images for concerts, the metering is really great. 3 out of 10 had blurred pics without flash on concert, don't expect a non dslr camera being perfect for this kind of situation. But it you would, you can use it with flash but set the exposure and also (important!) flash compensation settings to get the balanced results. This is what i really love about this camera, you can set up the flash level, so if you're a flash hater (like i do) you would love this feature cos i can get great pics with flash, but after i set between the flash&exposure; compensations, shutter&aperture; settings, i'm able to take  decent images in low light like i didn't use flash at all! The best is it has really strong flash (one of it's features), you can get great flash level for the objects that feets feets away from you, or great for taking portrait pics, so you just need to adjust it. Trust me it's GREAAATT !It's even beat the canon S3 and S5, don't get me wrong, i also love canons, but i witnessed this case myself cos my buddy (who has that S3 & S5) has been with me on many concerts, many pics (6 or 7 out of 10)that he took are either blurred or overexposed even when i tried them myself with different settings, still no luck. And also the video quality not as good. Even in motion, my h5 can take artistic pic like a dragged colors & lights (in a good way) of the subjects in really low light, but just sometimes, still better that having blurry images. Set it to vivid mode, you'll love it if you don't care about what people said \"natural-colors\" .. let's being artistic and have fun!This camera also amazingly takes a superb quality of video and amazing amazing sound! With it's ability for zooming while you taking vids, and remember that you have 12x zoom capability .. nice!At first i didn't really know how to use those aperture & shutter priority, or exposure and flash compensation, so i had several blurred pics on low light without flash. But even if you don't use flash, if you knew hot to set up between those settings, you can get a steady shot without flash. So as for now, my only con is only for it's size and the memory stick .. that's all, but i can live with it.Well, all of those above is only my humble opinion based on my experiences , different people has different taste, preference and needs. This camera works for me, but not necessarily going to work for you, especially if you don't know how to use it (all cameras actually). Just take your time, do your homework, play with it all along, you'll understand every gadget you have eventually.

I recently donated my camera during a trip to Brazil after realizing that it is time to move on.  There are great things about this camera, but be well warned, IT IS NOT AN ADEQUATE CAMERA TO TAKE PHOTOS UNDER LOW LIGHT USING FLASH.  The flash is very powerful, but the average flash photo will be overexposed.  The flash's cycle time is enough to drive me crazy.  You take a photo and have to wait too long for the flash to recharge.  I was at my son's birthday party in Brazil, I wanted to take many photos of our friends and families.  The first problem I had, as I mentioned above, is the fact that the flash was washing out people's skin tone.  I realize that direct flash is terrible from any camera, but the H5 is worse than other cameras I've used before in terms of achieving poor results with flash when it comes to human subjects.  They looked overexposed most of the time.  I set it to manual, changed the flash compensation, asked my subjects to wait for another shot, then waited a while until the flash recharged and took the photo again.  I noticed that people were running out of patience and didn't want to wait 10 seconds for the flash to recharge so I could retake the shot hoping their skin would look natural.  When it was cake time, I missed the most important part of the party.  I took a photo of my son blowing out the candles and, sure enough, his skin ton looked blown out, overexposed, horrible.

It finally started giving me some focus issues after almost 6 years of use, so it was time for a new camera.  I research the heck out of every product I purchase.  The two I was considering were the H5 and Canon's S3-IS.  Everything I read leaned slightly in favor of the Sony.  The deciding factor was the LCD.  Sony had the awsome LCD and Canon's was barely visible in bright sunlight.  (I did go to a local retailler to check it out)  So I bought the Sony.  Read the manual through and through.  The beautiful LCD comes with a price.  IT SWALLOWS BATTERIES like they were'nt even there.  2 batteries are not enough to power this LCD.  I tried several brands of batteries, consumer and pro grade.  Never made it past 40 pictures with flash.  The second reason this product is so weak-an average of 2-3 clear shots out of every 10.  Image quality, to me, is quite important.  I write this entry to warn you all, the pictures on my 6 year old camera blew these away.
