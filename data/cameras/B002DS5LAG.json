I did not expect professional quality, but for the price I expected more than this. First, the camera does not take consistantly clear pictures, no matter what setting you put it on. Even If you are using the flash and taking pictures inside, most of the pictures are either too darks or too light and some even have a yellow tint to them. Using the camera in a host of different settings (inside and outside), more than half of the pictures are blurry, even when you and your subject are standing still. I was a little shocked to read that anyone gave this camera a decent review. So, today I have begun shopping for a new camera.  If you are looking for a camera for yourself, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A VIVITAR VIVACAM 8025!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "good for the price", "Author": "Ryan Hodes", "ReviewID": "RBP06JCWPQNPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is better then most other cameras in the same price range.

I've tried finding it again, because I've bought a couple of other brand digital cameras & I've hated them!! So I got on here, Amazon has EVERYTHING, & found this one! It's great!!!!", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Takes pictures about as well as my phone", "Author": "M. Ratts", "ReviewID": "R1ZX7HX678364M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros: Super easy if you want to just point and shoot without adjusting anything.Cons: Poor picture quality, touch screen zoom is impossible to use in the middle of a continuous shoot, to take memory card out you have to remove battery (then put everything back, try to turn it on, realize you put the battery in backwards, and start over...), \"touch screen\" is a misnomer - you don't actually touch the screen, you have an area to touch to select options.I purchased this camera about 18 months ago and used it rarely. I never was very good about taking pictures - or doing anything with them! Lately I've been taking pictures of my baby with my phone, and while the pictures turn out ok, the speed is irritating so I dug out this camera. While taking pictures it appeared as though I'd get much better photos with this. After putting the pics on my computer, however, I was sadly disappointed. Almost everything was blurry. I messed with the settings and got them to the \"anti-shake\" and \"sports\" settings, presumably what you would use for action photos. The only pics that turned out were the ones of my stoic son standing perfectly still. There seems no hope of capturing my crawling daughter with this. I guess if you like photographing still life, this camera will work well. If you want to capture anything that moves, try another one.I gave it an extra star because of the price. Can't complain too much if you're not willing to really invest, I guess.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002DS5LAG"}}
