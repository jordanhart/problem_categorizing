{"Reviews": [{"Title": "APS-C sensor, Wifi features, good image quality, good value", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R1FV9DUP8IKVC2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung NX1000 Review  (From my review of the White model which is identical except for color):The main things that drew my interest with this camera were the Wifi features (I have a Samsung WB150F and the Wifi features have worked well.  I find them useful and convenient, especially the PC-Autobackup which transfers movies and images to your PC), the large APS-C sensor (more image detail), the compact, mirror-less design, and the recent price drops.The NX1100 will debut with a MSP of $599 (vs. $699 for the NX1000) and comes bundled with Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 and some new Wifi features - namely Autoshare.  But guess what?  Autoshare is available for the NX1000 in the 1.13 firmware update!  I already own Adobe Photoshop LR 4, and even with the lower NX1100 price, the NX1000 (basically the same camera) at current prices (340-360) is a great value.  Compared to models like the 200/210 it offers the exact same APS-C sensor and is almost identical in image quality and handling.  what you are giving up is the AMOLED display, metal body and a few other minor things.  (The LCD display on the 1000/1100 is fine, if not quite as good as far as contrast, deep blacks, it is still very usable.)So...how does the pudding taste? Well, I will admit my overwhelming first impression was \"plastic!\" - though the build quality seems very good, there is an overall \"plasticky\" feel to the NX1000.  (Thankfully, the tripod thread is metal!)  The shutter and other bits are metal as well, including the lens mounts.I use Panasonic and Olympus cameras, mostly, and even those in this price range have a bit nicer \"feel\" in that sense  But, it's a very high quality plastic and I soon got over it except for the fact that I find the grip a bit slick and could see myself dropping this camera, so I immediately attached the strap.  Not a big fan of the strap.  It's OK, but I do not like the ring attachments used versus the more usual cloth through metal guides on my other cameras.  I find the strap interfering with my grip due to where the attachment rings are located and this is quite annoying.  I will probably remove this strap for that reason once I find a case I like.  You can work around it, but I just don't like it.  (Update: I'm adjusting to this and not as irritating as before.)While we're quibbling, I'm also not a big fan of the way the Zoom lens \"locks\" when not in use.  It does give a lower profile, but it takes some getting used to, as I've never experienced this design before.  Again, a minor thing.  Overall appearance is good, it looks like a serious camera.  I got the white model and like the \"Elvis vibe\" it gives off.  Also the markings are easy to read, it's comfortable to hold (with the 20-50mm lens) and the recessed mode dial is a nice touch.  (It's even better with the awesome 16mm wide angle pancake lens!  Much slimmer profile and very easy to hold and shoot with.)In general, as far as controls, the design is well thought out and Samsung offers some unique and original twists such as the \"Fn\" and \"iFn\" control buttons which allow easy access to the main things you'd want to \"tweak\" when shooting.  The controls work well and the \"ring/wheel\" control works very well.  I was a bit skeptical, but in use I really liked it.  For example, when flipping through your shots in playback mode it works very well and you can scroll through the images very quickly.Nice to have the hotshoe, though I have not tried the flash unit supplied yet - will report back on that. Videographers might note that there is an external mike that works with the hotshoe and uses no cables at all, nice!In general, I find the NX1000 easy to use, the manual focus works well, the Smart mode seems to do fairly well, there are a great many scene modes and other (somewhat gimmicky) features (Magic filters/frames, etc.).  I enjoyed playing with those on the WB150F, but they seem out of place here.  There are a superb number of image adjustments, exposure tweaks, and  controls of a more serious nature as well. When you want to get serious, this camera is ready.  Also, some of  the fun things, like the Panorama mode, do work well if you understand their limitations and keep your expectations reasonable.As expected, the APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is the big plus for this camera. I was very pleased with the results under good lighting conditions.  I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that.  The noise reduction seems to work well up to about 1600 or so (maybe 800 for purists).  Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras.  If you like the \"boost\" many cameras give by default, there is a \"Vivid\" mode which will do this for you.  Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds).  I'm sure with experience my results will improve over these initial test shots, so that bodes well.  If you like to print big, 16x20, even 20x30 possibly, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.The 20-50mm kit lens is nice enough, but has a very limited range compared to what I am used to.  (I am considering getting the 30mm lens which I think would make a nice compact package for everyday use.)  However, the images look good, sharp, detailed, so I am happy with it.  Video worked well and the zoom worked fine in video mode and was silent.  In casual use, there is no need to switch the dial to video mode, you can just press the Video button on the back and after a slight pause you're in action.  This is nice.  Of course, dialing to full video mode gives you more options.Wifi features worked fine, I was able to easily connect and save pics using the autobackup mode.  Skydrive and others worked fine.  Have not tried the mobile link and remote view finder apps yet. (Update:  I tried these apps out and they worked OK for the most part.  A bit flaky at times.  There is a new \"Smart Camera app\" to replace these, but it only works with the new firmware.  Since I have not yet upgraded the firmware, have not tried it.)  The PC_Autobackup mode works very well for transferring pics and movies to your PC.  It remembers what has been transferred and only transfers new items.  Best to transfer frequently, since slower than reading from a card, but all automatic and very convenient.  [You can also transfer photos to your mobile devices (phone/tablet) using the other apps (Mobile Link/Smart Camera).]Example: You get back from shooting, you activate the PC-Autobackup on the camera (your laptop/PC and network must be on, of course), and the camera will connect and begin transferring your content.  When done the camera will turn-off (unless you press a control button within 30 seconds) and you can set the PC to shutdown as well if you like.  Or you can select the \"open folder\" choice on the PC/notenook popup dialog and view your pics and movies.  All very easy and convenient.There is a \"Smart Range\" feature to extend  dynamic range and preserve highlights.  It seems to work well, but you lose shadow detail. Might want to turn off by default, I think.  (You can also shoot RAW and tweak things  yourself, of course.)JPEGS look very good to me with a lot of detail and sharpness.  So good that I think shooting JEPG only is feasible with the NX1000.  (You can always switch to RAW or RAW+Jpeg when needed, of course.)  I think many will find the Jpegs entirely adequate for most purposes.  (If you shoot a lot at high ISO's you would definitely want to shoot RAW.)  You have a range of aspect ratios including 1:1, 3:2, and 16:9.  This is nice and gives you flexibility in camera versus cropping later.The 8fps burst mode worked very well, though as has been noted everywhere, there is a lag as the camera processes the shots before you can shoot again.  I am a fairly deliberate photographer and don't shoot much action/sports, so the NX1000 is fine for me.  The occasional lags when switching modes and after bursts or RAW shots are not an issue for me, but could be for some.  It's all covered in many of the excellent online reviews, so I won't dwell on it here.  Overall, I found the camera responsive and adequate for my needs.The LCD screen is bright, colorful and has good resolution.  I was pleased with it.  I generally favor optical view finders (sorry, I admit to being old school here, you can't beat a good optical VF IMHO) and even EVF in a pinch, but I am getting used to the non-VF style of shooting and the NX1000 LCD is very good in this respect.In general, I am very pleased with the image quality and the feature set and think this camera is an excellent value at current prices.  Many of the features are unique, the Wifi modes are the best I've seen to date, and the  APS-C sensor seems to be a good one.  It's fairly compact with the 20-50mm kit lens (and would be even more so with the 30mm pancake lens), easy to carry (not heavy), and has all the controls you could ever want.  The images are very good and that's the main thing.I think it's an easy 4 stars for overall quality and especially value for the price paid.----------------Update: I recently purchased the Samsung f2.4 16mm wide angle \"pancake\" lens (Samsung 16mm f/2.4 NX Ultra Wide Pancake Lens (Black)) and it's a great addition to this camera.  Wonderful for landscapes and walk-about/street photography.  It's the lens I keep on the camera by default now.  Quicker auto-focus, faster optics(f2.4 vs f3.5), and a more compact profile.  When I have the 16mm lens on the body, I feel this is a 5 star combo.  (I am leaving the rating at 4 stars with the kit lens, which is an excellent lens.  I just find the 16mm to be the \"magic\" lens with this body. Very subjective, of course.)Update:  I did not cover video very well above, suffice to say the quality of the video is excellent for a camera in this price range and superior to many, I would guess.  It is full HD 30/60 fps.  You can Zoom during video shooting and it supports external microphones and stereo sound.  All the basics are here and a few pluses as well.  You can even use many of the special effects in video mode should you wish to do so.  There is a dedicated video button for instant access, and a dial selection for more options.  Videos take longer to transfer over wifi due to their size, but do transfer fine.  Sound quality id pretty good for a camera of this type, in my opinion.  So, if you are traveling, you have both stills and video covered.  (I still feel a dedicated video camera and full fledged DSLR are optimal. But I must say, the combo capabilities here are quite fine.)Video Format: MP4 (H.264), Compression: Movie H.264, Sound AACFrame Rate: 60fps (1280 x 720 Only), 30fps (1920 x 1080), 24fps (1920 x 810)Image Sizes: 1920 x 1080, 1920 x 810, 1280 x 720 , 640 x 480, 320x240 for Sharing (Default: 1920 x 1080)Movie Editing: Still Image Capture, Time TrimmingUpdate: I did not mention that the kit lens (20-50mm) does not have image stabilization, nor does the body.  Has not been a problem for me (I shoot old school, bracing, etc.), but it was a consideration in buying the low cost and excellent 16mm wide angle for this body (very compact and little worries about image stabilization, larger sensor works in favor here) and dedicating this to camera to the wide end, while using my Panasonic G1 for the mid/telephoto range (as I already have excellent lenses for my G1 in this range).  I still have the 20-50mm (an excellent lens) in the bag and can switch when needed.  The lenses I have already for my G1 are superb, so this works out well for me.You can buy image stabilized Samsung lenses (like the 18-55mm) if that is a concern.  Shooting with the 20-50mm kit lens, I never once had any issues.  However, in low light situations, it might come into play.  Again, in my case, my G1 and f1.7 20mm would be my preferred choice, but I could get by with the NX1000.  It has good image quality at high ISO and even ISO 3200 is usable many times.  ISO 1600 is very good and ISO 800 is very clean.For quick \"grab and go\" shooting, I continue to enjoy this camera very much.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "High quality in a portable package", "Author": "green field \"greenfield\"", "ReviewID": "R1RTG99HFJTXX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got it, and as far as operation goes, so far so good. (Update: the WiFi features work just fine with iOS. The absence of any usage guide or screen grabs for the iOS app prompts the need to poke around to notice that the camera posts a hot spot that the iPhone has to join. That's reasonable, but not necessary on the Android version, and so not immediately obvious here).My software disk arrived blank, and repeated live chats with Samsung support, (which may not have been specific to cameras), only concluded that their bundled PC backup app, Intelli-Studio, could not be downloaded anywhere, and I would have to buy a new CD, as they would not replace the blank one. Such are the trials of buying on line, but those were mitigated by Amazon's great cooperation. As it turns out, my first attempt to buy this resulted in a used/refurb unit intentionally or accidentally sent by Market Place Deals as new, (both seals broken), also in the white, rather than the specified, black color. So, since it was fulfilled by Amazon, it was only a minor annoyance to return it, and I was able to get the software from that unit's functional disk before I sent it back. This review is of the new replacement, sold by Huppins and fulfilled by Amazon.Though a prosumer user of the product, who doesn't sell or publish its results, on first blush, the image quality is great. I haven't gotten around to comparing all of the modes, but it has a fairly straight forward interface that's mostly apparent on first use, but that's also adequately documented in their provided manual. One of my main uses for this is intended to be video, for which it provides 1080/30p, but as I expected, the audio from the built in mic, though stereo, is a bit thin, so I am trying the external mic, (which is fortunately available for the NX hot shoe), which I should receive soon.In total, it's a high image quality camera that's still portable, without sacrificing the flexibility of many lens options. I've only used the bundled, 20-50mm f/3.5-5.6 ED lens, but it supports other very well reviewed lenses. It also has a hot shoe for several flash options or, (not simultaneously), an optional external mic, or an optional EVF, and it has the built-in ability to use a mobile app for a wireless remote control and viewfinder.For those who were wondering, as I was, exactly what's in the box, (since for some reason none of the sellers describe it), this is what comes in the product that I think, for the black model, has the full name of EV-NX1000BABUS:  It does indeed include the small version, (SEF 8A), of the external flash which is about the equivalent of a popup flash, and pretty unobtrusive to leave connected.  20-50mm f/3.5-5.6 ED lens and caps.  Body cap.  USB cable.  ED-BP1030 Battery.  Battery charger and power cable.  Software disk with manuals, RAW converter, and Intelli-Studio backup software, (with some other features).  Camera strap.  Also, what I think is a leash for the lens cap, which will be very handy once I see the correct way to attach it.It is indicated clearly that this does not include any SD card. There is some confusing and shady market speak, starting on the Samsung site and showing up elsewhere, that includes among the NX1000's features \"Premium Metal Design\". I guess that's like the old \"all natural flavors\" claim. There are models below and above this that are magnesium, (like the smaller EX2F), but this one is a thick, and seemingly adequate plastic. I don't know why they'd want to make any misleading suggestion that it is anything else. Then there are a few odd quirks with it, like the prompts to download the corresponding mobile app every time that camera feature is launched, along with verbose descriptions upon the selection of every mode. Those prompts can be helpful at first, but there should be a system setting to turn them off, (update: there is in fact a setting to do just that, under the 2nd list of Settings choices). So a very tidy package for a capable system.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Alex Vergara", "ReviewID": "R1KQCC2QQOTF0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung NX-1000 is a step forward to bridging the gap between point and shoot cameras and DSLR cameras. The quality of the images are simply beautiful, day or night. The small flash that comes with the camera is surprisingly effective. I wasn't expecting much out of it. I've taken a couple of pictures of friends and family indoors and the quality that the flash produces is top notch. When I saw the images on my Macbook, the quality resembled that of what one would see in like in a commercial or episode of \"How to Make It in America\" haha.  Since it's a compact camera, I can take this Samsung anywhere I go and can leave my Nikon D7000 at home. I have a grip on it and I hated it when I had to bring that bulky thing at family dinners. I haven't tried the video mode yet, for I have only owned this camera for a couple of days now. The wi-fi syncing wasn't a big deal to me, but the feature works well and it doesn't take long for your images to be transferred to your certain account. One thing that was a flaw was the very limited accounts you could send your pictures to. They only had Facebook, Youtube, Picasso, and email. Twitter and Tumblr would have been awesome add-ons; Instagram not so much cause that's gonna be in the Samsung Galaxy Smart Camera, which basically a camera that's a phone. Overall, I am pleased with this product and do recommend it to people who want a compact camera, but can also deliver sharp, high quality, images.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY NICE , at <$400, a Great Choice over LX7, XZ2, P7700.....", "Author": "J. Conner \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "RGPQU7V9YYTFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Maybe my real rating is 4.5 stars in good light, 3.5 stars in low-light.Pros:a./ Lighter weight than Sony NEX's...b./ Pretty accurate WB...c./ Good flash...d./ Very nice user interface (Samsung is different, but nice)....e./ A lot of adjustments available in most every mode...Loved that.f./ Fairly quiet operation.g./ Very good video.Cons:a./ Quality pics stop at ISO1600 except with well lit scenes.b./ Stabilzer not as good as the leader, Lumix. Below 1/25 shutter speeds is hit and miss, whereas Lumix often can handle 1/6...really a factor indoors.c./ Auto Mode really tries to hold below ISO 800, so low-light is blurry more often than when the camera is user-programmed to use ISO 1600 or 3200. The NX100 does take very nice indoor photos indoors on a tripod at ISO400, but not if there is any movement.Even tho the Pros outnumber the Cons by a lot, those Cons are very crucial, at least to me. An APS-C 20mp sensor should do a lot better than ISO1600 in low-light, and ISO3200 in good light as far as a quality picture is concerned. And I don't think the noise is there as a reaction to minimal jpeg processing, which would mean you could get great RAW at least. I did not test RAW, but to me the high ISO results showed noise AND loss of detail much more than the 16mp Sony NEX5N I had for side-by-side comparison. Further, what is odd with cameras today is exemplified in this NX1000 - it can give some excellent results, then in a similar situation, give something less...Even the NEX 5N displays this, although to a lesser degree.============================================================================-I've tried LX7, P7700, and XZ2 compacts also. The NX1000 does beat them at ISO 800 thru 3200, but is harder to carry. With better ISO at 800 and 1600, and with really better video, the NX1000 under $400 is a much better camera then these so-called \"premium compacts\" struggling to get every dot of their small sensors. Also, I really liked the NX1000 video, again better than those compacts by a comfortable margin.==============================================================================SPOILER ALERT: I love the much better ISO 3200 and 6400 stills from my NEX-5N, so if you find the 5N on sale under $575 and HAVE THE EXTRA BUCKS TO SPEND, it is the best deal of all these.

It takes incredibly sharp pictures.  Have owned various compact cameras over the years and this is my first camera with a bigger sensor.  It does not disappoint.  It can take 8 full resolution pictures a second which is great for getting action shots.  I also bought an EOS EF to NX adapter so that I can use some old lenses that I have from a film EOS 630.  Both a 75-300 mm f4.5-5.6 zoom and a 50 mm f1.8 EOS lens also take great pictures (with manual focusing and fully open aperture).  Unfortunately, during video shooting manual focusing seems more reliable than auto focusing.  After burst shooting you have to wait up to 10 seconds before you can continue shooting again (this is not that big a deal unless you are a professional photographer).  Also the WiFi file transfer app is real slow.  I always prefer to take the SD card out and transfer files rather than wait on the WiFi.  The remote control app is also extremely limited, hopefully they will improve this so that you have more camera control and a higher resolution preview image.  All in all this camera is a great deal for the $260 I payed for it (used, like new).", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Software not Mac compatible", "Author": "Careful rider", "ReviewID": "R1AQK5EWCLA1X2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has what you need to take great photos.  I chose it because it had a larger image sensor than similar cameras and it can be used in full manual mode.  It took some getting used to, and you will need to keep the manual handy.  I've used lots of analog SLRs in the past but this is my first digital camera with a removable lens.  So far I like it for many of the same reasons mentioned by other reviewers here.However, the biggest disappointment was finding out that the software needed to operate the wireless features are not Mac compatible.  That gives it 4 stars alone.Now I've found that you cant even update the firmware with out a Windows PC, which I don't own.  This means I'll have to take it back to the camera store where I bought it to have them update the firmware.  Without the firmware updates, the camera doesn't work with my Android tablet or newer lenses.It seems Samsung has made the very poor choice of viewing Apple as their enemy with the Galaxy vs iPad thing, and they have made many of their wireless products work only with Windows only as a result.To copy photos to a mac from the camera, you do it the old way and remove the SD card, plug it into the mac and load them into iPhoto.  The camera will not \"mount\" or be recognized in any way by OSX when you try use the USB cable to connect them.There is a \"one press\" video record button, which is a great idea, but they placed it where your right thumb holds the camera and I keep pressing it accidentally.  Usually right as I try to release the shutter.  The grip could be better.Shooting in normal indoor lighting is difficult without a flash.Outdoors or in very bright light is where this camera really impresses with it's image quality.

After experimenting with some similar cameras, I have come to conclusion that without an electronic viewfinders (EVF), these cameras are not better than typical compact fixed lens cameras. One is better off to stick with a good point and shoot camera because they do the job well. The reason is that you absolutely cannot take creative pictures in bright daylight just by looking at the LCD. LCD is completely washed out under sunlight. Presumably, you buy an interchangeable lens camera to try different lenses and get out of the house to take pictures. The dilemma is that as soon as a manufacturer adds an EVF, the price of the unit almost doubles.

I realize its not a \"top of the line\" digital camera, but its gotten some very good reviews on this site as well as Cnet, etc.I've had the camera about a month and find it not to be as intuitive as I expected. Perhaps I don't understand what a cameras capability is or should be, but I find myself spending lots of time changing settings to get a good shot... So I basically take 10 of the same shot until I get one I think looks fairly good. Needless to say the people waiting to have their photo taken aren't thrilled.  The \"smart\" setting is the worst by far. The only time the photos looks good is in perfect day light.The \"backlight\" setting seems to be the most consistent even when I don't have backlight. I've gotten SOME really nice photos.  The photos that do come out are really crisp and clear. I can zoom in and literally see the pores in peoples skin. I'm really torn over this one.. I sort of feel I shouldn't have to work this hard to get a good consistent photo and am wondering if I spend a couple of hundred $$ more if I'll get a much better camera? I may actually end up returning this sadly. What a dilemma.PS: Also, I noticed a tiny chip on the lens so I'm hoping I can get that replaced, assuming I keep the camera...", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Satisfied!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R26U57Z1YP63DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is Very Good pictures are sharp of course if you have steady hands and do a really good job in low light! soon is short but it gets the job done.
