I have the older model the FD-91 and love it; the only two things I would like added were  added to the new FD-95. One was the limited flash. They have added a hot  shoe for an external flash and it now gives you the same indoor flash  quality as the old SDL cameras. The other was the somewhat low DPI. The  olderFD-91 was at 1024 x 768 the new FD-95 is way up at 1600 x 1200. With  this amount of Dpi you can print a full 8-1/2 x 11 picture that truly looks  like a photo. The new eye viewer is centered in the camera and has a wider  opening with eyeglass correction focus. The mike for Audio in located on  the front as before it was on top, and is more sensitive. I do miss the  moveable LCD for self-portraits, but not many of them taken anyway! The  steady shot is a must and was one of the best features. I used it all the  time, when you are on the10x~20x it is a must. The new FD-95 now has a date  and/or time stamping on the picture that can be used or eliminated. This  might be useful for showing the correct time or date as the file  information could be changed. The only con's I have found is the battery  charging system. I liked the old separate charger that you could charge a  battery as you are away using the camera, but then you can buy the extra  battery charger as an accessory. Now you have to leave the battery in the  camera and hook up the charging system to the camera. The other was the  video mode; it is only 15 seconds now. I liked the 60-sec. mode on the  older FD-91, but the larger format is nice. The camera style is a little  more compact and well balanced. The new date and time stamping is a nice  added feature.", "Date": "August 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Photos are fun again", "Author": "Richard  Eckman", "ReviewID": "R2T7ES18HKT2PN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are considering a jump from your trusty old SLR to digital, this camera is the reason to do it.  The ability to review a shot right after taking it, reshoot it if you like, and then email the image home is fantastic.  Any digital camera can do that, but this one gives you ease of use, sound annotation, remarkable quality of images, great zoom capability, and worthwhile advanced features as well. This camera is ready to travel.  The batteries recharge quickly in the camera off 110V US or 220V European style outlets with the cables provided.  Also, any computer shop can move your images from floppies to a CD for cheap.  You might also be able to upload your images to a web site.  You don't need to carry 400 disks on a long trip as you can reuse them.Limitations:- This is not a small, unobtrusive camera.  The FD-95 is comparable in size to a big SLR.  You'll need to carry floppies also, so plan on a bag.- I have had a 2% failure rate writing images to floppies.  (Might be the disks.  Buy good disks!)- Action shots are harder as the image capture is slower than with an SLR.  You'll need to anticipate your shot.- The placement of the LCD view screen is perfect for catching nose prints.- No JPEG viewer/editor is provided, though you can download a great one from CompuPic for ($).- No case is provided.  (See bag, above.)- No warranty comes in the box.  5 year third-party warranties are about ($).- Only one battery pack is provided.

I was impressed with the features my friend was doing on it, and that's what got me hooked.  I looked around and did a little comparison shopping and decided on the  MVC-FD95.  I like the feel of it (feels like my old 35mm Minolta) and it  was extremely easy to use.  I feel this camera has a slew of features that  make it very attractive.  The viewfinder and the LCD screen are very easy  to work with and the menus are easy to navigate also.  The MPEG movie  feature with audio are also nice too.  Primarily I was impressed with the  1600 x 1200 image size.  Shots came out really clear and crisp.  The built  in flash is adequate but it at least lets you hook up an external flash.  Probably the downside for some (but not necessarily for me) is the floppy  disk memory, meaning you can only put approx 4 shots of hi-resolution shots  on disk before its full.  However, I look at it as not a big deal, because  floppy disks are cheap and I carry a bundle in my bag anyway.  Plus floppy  disks can go directly into your computer's disk drive (an advantage for  me). The main limiting factor could be price... .  But this camera is  extremely easy to use and I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of mine.  Sony  also has a lot more features on it that I didn't mention, but go to the  store and look (and play) with one and compare it!

The zoom is the fun part when you zoom in the people's faces while you're at around 25 meters from them. Pros : -Too easy to use. Just points and shoot.-Floppy disks are [inexpensive] and simple to manipulate. Just insert the disk, copy, and \"voil\u00e0\". Some people prefer buying compact flash cards because of their size, but when they realize they have room to spare, money was wasted. -It takes excellent pictures. Bad pictures are made by the user, not by the camera.-Zoom, zoom, zoom.Cons : -I wish it could take pictures faster. -The compatibility with memory sticks is useless when their prices are so high. I end up paying 10 bucks the meg and it isn't faster with sticks. -The batteries are expensive. They are drained after more than 90 shots at 1024x768. I love to take landscape pictures and clouds as wallpaper. Buying a 3 mega pixel camera with a 3x zoom(optical) and 2x zoom(digital) is nothing compared to this one, because you can't even zoom in to see someone's face near you and you will get mad when the subject is too far away. Last words : night shots are darker than expected, but when you reduce the images' brightness, you could see more details. Go to a retailer store and see it for yourself. It may be heavy and big, but what could you expect from such a great camera. My second choice of camera would be those tiny ones with 3 mega pixel and 64 megs, because of it's size and speed.

The two criteria which ultimately led to the FD95 were the ability to write on standard diskettes and the resolution of 2.1 Megapixels. (The diskette requirement limits the choice to Sony). Regardless of the validity of our criteria, I can safely say that we are satisfied with the purchase, having used it now for several months.The advantage of the diskettes is debatable. We like their simplicity and the ease of transfer to a computer. On the down side, the capacity is small. This is readily apparent when taking high resolution shots (four shot per disk). For job-site photos, the 30 shots per diskette capacity is adequate. As for the debate, I have heard that using a high-capacity flash memory card and a USB connection is an equally convenient method of transfer. Perhaps so. Sony does provide for the use of a \"Memory Stick\" with the FD95 with an adapter, which can then be simply inserted into a disk drive.Although the resolution is not the best available, it is more than adequate for our uses: job-site record snap shots and promotional brochure photos. For these, we use the lowest and highest resolutions, respectively.The ease-of-use is good, with the feature menus being relatively intuitive. The feature list is also impressive, though many are not particulary applicable to our needs (the video feature falls in the \"neat-o\" category). We are particarly pleased with the quality of the optics and the optical zoom capability. The camera has a nice heft and feels solidly constructed, a feature that is important in our application.One downside to the camera is its bulk, but this is directly attributable to the diskette memory feature and the professional-quality optics. Another minor criticism is the inability to control how the files are named; it would be nice to \"wildcard\" the sequnetially-numbered names with a job-specific prefix.Overall, we would recommend this camera to anyone who had similar criteria as our own. If compactness is the primary concern, look elsewhere. If you can justify the expense, consider the Sony model that writes to CD-RW.", "Date": "April 8, 2001"}, {"Title": "Simplicity & Convenience!!", "Author": "Ralph R. Heerens", "ReviewID": "R29LAJD677MWWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought the camera in early December, a last minute splurge before our trip to Asia over the holidays. My only instructions came from a brief review of the manual but it was enough to take advantage of many of the features of the MVC-FD95 camera. The operation became second nature to me in no time. My wife, a true techni-phobe was able to operate it with great results with only a few seconds of instruction and felt very comfortable using it (unlike the VCR). One of the silliest (yet impressive) pictures I took on the trip was from the crosswalk between the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur of our hotel in the distance. Using the full zoom, it brought the hotel into the viewfinder and with the steadyshot activated, made the picture seem like it was taken from a block away. To appreciate the picture you would have to see the shot from that distance without the use of any zoom. I took some beautiful macro shots of orhids and other exotic flowers with unbelievable colour and clarity. The camera was a luxury for us, however I am as thrilled with it now as when I first used it and just wish I had more time to fully discover the features. I read several reviews of this and other brands and although I was a bit concerned about the size, I have had no regrets. The floppy disk system is fantastic. Take the 3.5, put it in the floppy drive of your computer and you have the images ready for posting or editing. On our trip, I used it under some extreme conditions, high humidity and temperatures without any problems. I feel very comfortable recommending this camera.", "Date": "January 16, 2001"}, {"Title": "FD-95 Thoughts", "Author": "L.

I had used their cameras and loved what it could do but couldn't find it anywhere.  The only thing close was the FD-95. Although a bit pricier, I have not been disappointed in the camera.  I have gotten excellent results from it and was surprised at how light it is despite its deceptive looks.  It's very easy to handle and operate.  I highly recommend this camera, even for a veritable novice like myself.  The only downside I have found is something that was pointed out in another review -- it is slow when taking a picture.  You really have to hold that button down to get it to take and it makes taking my hockey action shots a bit of a challenge.  If that is the only thing that I can see as a problem, though, do yourself a favor and pick up one of these cameras.

I have used it in low light to full light conditions with good results. THe quality of the pictures is excellent, and you do not need to store your images in the highest resolution. Color rendition is also excellent, with a high level of resolution which is important in the type of work that I do.The storage on floppy discs has been very helpful to me, especially now that floppies are so inexpensive. You can store up to 32 pictures per disc which is close to using a 35mm camera film. I detail on the label the contents what is stored and have not had a problem with mixing pictures up. It will also allow you to film short mpeg movies of up to 5 seconds in duration.It is somewhat bulky to carry and will not fit a small camera bag. I certainly overcame the bulkiness without much problems. The menus to control the camera features are clear and easy to understand.

The camera is actually very light for its seemingly encumbering size, and while it is bigger than most cameras (due to the floppy drive), it fits quite well into my hands.  People with smaller hands may want a different camera like the Sony Cybershot.  I have taken a few pictures in different areas, outside, inside, light and dark and they all turned out great.  The 2.1 Megapixels are more than adequate for the amature photographer.  I haven't even begun to explore all the options, the self timer works great giving you 10 seconds to get into place with your friends or family before the picture is taken, and don't worry about focusing because the auto focus does a great job as well.  The main reason I picked this up over my other too choices was because the Cybershot F550 seemed to leave some blur in the pictures when I took my test shot with it, and the Olympus 2040 and 3040 just didn't have the zoom capability that I needed.  My one complaint is that the battery just doesn't seem to last long enough but I'll pick up the longer lasting battery and use the original as a spare.  Don't want to carry floppys around?  I have taken all my test photos on Floppies so far and at 1024 x 7xx I seem to be able to fit 10 pictures per disk.  I also picked up the memory stick adapter ... and a 64MB memory stick ... for when I am in a situation where disks seem to be too much of a hassle, like when I'm out on the town in Romania or Hungary or something.

Being immersed in black and white processing for years and needing a new camera I weighed getting a new Nikon and all the darkroom equipment necessary for color processing.Since I am a photo hobbyist, I was unable to justify the expense of the equipment plus having to buy a new set of lenses. The Sony Mavica with its SLR viewfinder capability struck me as an ideal compromise. You are able to actually view what will be taken while the LCD allows those surreptitious candid people shots.It is great being able to down load pictures into my iMac and manipulate color balance, crop, and electronically 'dodge' the darker areas to achieve what your mind's eye saw when taking it. The Sony supplied software is a waste of a CD, though. Get Photoshop to really use the capabilities of this camera.There are a load of features which make this camera ideal for both portraiture and landscape photography. But it is also eminently suited for those quick snap shots.Having a true 10X optical zoom with a compound lens lends itself to nearly any situation . I rarely use the digital zoom although, with its higher than average CCD size and pixel count, little resolution is lost.All in all, a great camera for the ardent hobbyist as well as the casual user.

Its 10X optical zoom affords greater utilization which most other cameras do not offer. Built in mic and MPEG recording capability can be useful in some situations.

I only remember rechearching a battery every two days. That's how great it is.I used it outside when it was hot(it was always hot though) and it never malfunctioned. The heat may have damaged a disk or two, from my bulk of 75 pack.Let's keep things simple:-The zoom is incredible! Sometimes you see once in a lifetime shots, but they're usually far, far away. With this camera, you'll have that chance! They say that the digital zoom reduces the quality of your pics, but I don't really care and it doesn't affect significantly enough to make it lower than excellent.-My last review said \"more than 40 pics per battery\". After filling my 75 disks, it seemed to be 100 if you don't use the LCD screen too often. Why it was 40 for me? I used up a lot of juice when I was showing the pics to people. That's all.-The weight may be an advantage if you see it differently. I might use a heavier camera for a job so a 2 pound camera is nothing. If I used a lighter camera, it was much easier shaking it and ruining the pic. I took 800 pics in a week. Did I complain? Nope.-The slow speed can also be a good factor. If you had a slow camera, you would be careful to take any pictures. If you had a really fast one, you would take a whole lot more without being concerned about quality and also you need more memory. It made me a better photograph, simple as that.-The size is also a good factor. The grip is perfect. You can hold up your arm as a tripod and relax. With a small camera, you'll feel some tension after a while.-It's not a camera that can be stolen easily. If a robber grabbed it and ran away, it would slow him down and it would tire him out. A small camera, on the other hand, will be snatched and kept in a pocket. Need to say more?-I had no problem taking pics in a bus, but in a train, things may pop up by bluring anything behind. Be sure that the window is clean since usually it's dirty(the dust or filth is usually black or disgusting).Well if you asked me why you should buy it, I have to compare it with other models. First the zoom eliminates most of cameras so we have a few left. You must have a stable zoom, one out. Then you must tell me how many pics you have to take in 10 seconds. This one can take around 2.5 so it's nice for trips or anything else. I don't recommend this one if you must take a lot of good pics in a short time, but then you wouldn't need the zoom so it's up to you. I recommend compact flash or smart media so the price total will rise up quickly. The pics are bigger(around 2 to 10 times as much memory of sony mvc-95) so you must buy a lot of 128 mb cards.

It has very good telephoto facilities but the wide angle (39mm equivalent) is not really wide enough for landscapes.  4. I found that it was quite slow at taking pictures and if the shot was of a bird it had flown away by the time the camera had taken the picture.  5. I got 90 minute battery life and the recharge time was quite good.  6. Changing floppies was a pain in the rear (10 pics/floppy at 1040x768), it also has 1600x1200 resolution but you only get 4 pics to a floppy.  7.

It uses a diskette for storage. The reason I chose it was the built in flash, the universal ability to print, and the Zooming lense for those great Memphis Zoo panda and other animal pics when they are far away from the viewing area. There might be better cameras, but none are as easy to use and take GREAT pictures.I love the two viewing areas. I look at the view scrren and see how the picture looks. You can sit at a wedding (I actually did this)and look at the screen and decide to keep or erase the picture. The diskettes are easy to keep in a dess coat at the wedding and change. My pictures looked better than the paid professional ones the couple paid big bucks for!!!! Plus, I did a brief video with the camera of the wedding march (with sound).My buddy is a camera buff and he has a FD 75, and when I pulled my 95 out, well it psyched him out with the look and the size.Every development studio and computer accepts diskettes, so it is easy to sent to another person. This is helpful to send by mail. You know those internet phonelines will not sent pictures very fast, and many have limits to the mail size to avoid spam. Just drop a diskette in the mail and grandma with her older clunkier hand-me-down computer can see the pics of the grandkids.Now for the real techie, you can use the memory stick adaptor. I bought mine remanufactured and didnt get the adaptor for memory stick. It is a great add-on, but not essential. I'll stay with the diskettes, because they are cheaper, easy to get and easy to use in any computer.One suggestion, get an extra battery. there are used ones and clone ones now that are cheaper ($15-$22.00), so it isn't the big investment it used to be of $35. to $55.00. Sony uses the same battery in numerous products. I found the battery gave out too quick (or I used it too much).  Plus, when you use the camera, you will be in a place that a recharge is not possible, and the extra battery is a great help.My only complaint is the switch from still-to-video-to-play pops too easy from one to the other. It has really played havoc with the pictures. BUT I think that is more all thumbs me and not the camera.Suprisingly, the price of a 95 has held up well in resale. I paid maybe 60.00 more than it is re-selling for now. That is a perk, if you plan to resell after a set time of use.", "Date": "March 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Didn't live up to it's reputation", "Author": "Jacquelyn Kahn", "ReviewID": "R3GD665YGBNT78", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera 14 months ago - stepping up from my Kodak DC220.  I wanted the extended zoom capacity - and unknowingly sacrificed quality and user ease.  Exterior shots where lighting was ample, for the most part, are excellent - but as I do an extensive amount of interior shots for \"reporting\" purposes, this camera would not have a rated a \"one\".  With my Kodak, the included written materials were outstanding as well as their on line information.  With Sony - I presume they take it for granted that the buyer knows \"everything\".  I feel bad that I encouraged someone else to purchase this camera, as they are now equally as unhappy (unaware that I was also displeased).  I just purchased a the Nikon Coolpix775 - and have been so repeatedly and consistently impressed that I will upgrade next year.

THE AUTO FOCUS MAY TAKE TOO LONG FOR ACTION SHOTS.

The like taking this camera to any concerts or shows and you have all the images on floppy..share it with people or publish on the net..just great. and on top it supports image stabilization just like my other Sony TRV87 and i can exchange batteries between them. The only thing which I don't like that much are the big size of this..due to 3-1/2 inch floppy and MPEG movie.. which is not very good in quality if you are moving the camera very fast and I don't even make many mpeg's out of this.
