I didn't have a spare camera so I took a chance and ran 2 lines up, over & around obstacles (200 Ft. long) to where I would be ready when my cameras came in.  The results: one worked, one DIDN'T.  The Power in one was OK but the video was dead on arrivel  Both runs were taped together so I had to take the whole mess back down to remove the bad one.  I then stripped the power cord from the bad cable to use some other way someday as it checkd out good'  The outer jacket appears to be very thin and easily torn, not like what comes with a camera system but I needed a 200 Ft run and systems are usually just about 60 Ft.  The remaining 3 cables checked out good but are \"Flimsy\" compared to what comes with a complete system.  Pay attention to the reviews... TEST BEFORE INSTALLING!!!  Don't be a Dumb Bunny like me & figure it can't happen TO ME!  (but it did)", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "High quality", "Author": "Simon F.

They are in a thick coating and can be stretched far, like from tree to tree unlike the ones that come with the cameras that I am using these on.
