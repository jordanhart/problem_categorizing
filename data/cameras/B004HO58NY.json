This camera has a 14MP CCD sensor, an excellent 24x zoom(24-576mm equivalent on a 35mm camera), A very nice 3\" LCD, Electronic Viewfinder, 720p video and ISO up to 6400(not that you really want to use it, more on that later)Ergonomics / Ease of Use:The menu system on the Finepix cameras are very nice and the buttons on the S3200 are nicely placed.  It has a nice grip around the lens and it would have been nice if that could have been incorporated as a zoom ring.Image Quality:From ISO 64-200, the pictures are very sharp with excellent color.  From ISO 400-800, the pictures are still sharp with nice color but signs of noise and the effects of noise reduction are noticeable if you start to pixel peep.  I would say these shots certainly are still capable of being printed at 5x7 and being used on the web with no issues.ISO 1600 - ISO 6400(ISO 3200 and 6400 can only be used with reduced MP resolution) I would only use this to make sure I could get the shot if that was the only option due to discoloration, smearing and loss of detail. This is very common across all smaller sensor cameras.Conclusion:This is an excellent bridge camera that takes sharp pictures with nice color.

I read all the reviews, especially the 1 and 2 stars by people who evidently have no clue about how to operate anything but a point-and-shoot. So here's the non-professional-but-I-know-a-few-things-about-cameras review.This is a very well featured DSLR, not a point and shoot, you have to know how to use the settings and features to get the pictures you want. If you want simple, then the above mentioned Canon Powershot A1000 IS is highly recommended. If you want something other than a cookie cutter approach to photography, READ THE DANG MANUAL. I've had mine for 2 weeks, used every single feature at least once, had zero problems once I got used to how to set up for the picture and actually found enjoyment in  photography again. I don't know what some people expect, this is not a $500 Canon Eos, but I have yet to have the problems that the 1 and 2 star people have experienced. Spend some time (at least 2 hours) with the manual in a park learning each setting, get to know what it's capable of, you will be less disappointed when it comes time to tune in a picture by memory.About the only suggestion I have is to get the Class 4 8gb card, I found especially in mixing HD video clips and pictures on the 10 to 14mp settings you fill up that 4gb card pretty quickly. On a recent trip to San Francisco I got about 12 minutes of good HD video and 426 mixed 10, 12 and 14mp pictures and still had some room left on the 8 gig card.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Bridge Camera", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R185YUVS4RZU8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent bridge camera that takes sharp pictures with nice color.

I have taken lots of pictures with it already, and have gotten a feel for how it works.The Good:- Image Stabilization. I thought it worked very well, and what Fuji says about it working great at full zoom is very true I have found.- Electronic Viewfinder. I think looks are misleading on this one, because it does look funky in the pictures. But the viewfinder is really big, which is a huge plus for me.- Black and White. I know this sounds wierd, but some cameras do have bad black and white settings. The metering is off and such. But this one did surprisingly well.- The Zoom. On some cameras you can only zoom in to 1x, 2x, etc. On this camera you can zoom in at 1.0x, 1.2x, 1.4x, etc. Really great for getting the perfect picture.- The Metering. Did a really great job with this. The colors were well balanced.- Colors. Colors were all true, especially in the dark reds/deep purples, even though most point-and-shoots have trouble with this.- Image Quality. I really thought it did a nice job with the pictures. Outside, they were noise-free.- The SR Auto and Auto modes. I am an experienced photographer, and I set it on Auto most of the time just because the camera did it just as well as I could have myself.The Evil:- Low-Light. Every camera has a problem with this, but this one really had some noisy images in low-light conditions. Not an ideal camera for this, but I did most of my photography outside, so it was okay with me.- Slow Focusing. Especially while zooming, the focus could be really slow.- Dial. Most cameras have a dial, and this one did, but it didn't have what you would think it would have on the dial. It had Auto, SR Auto, P, S, A, M, Panoramic, SP, and Movie Modes. No Macro or Portrait there, you have to go to a separate menu for that.- Zoom Ring. Well, there isn't one. It looks like there is one, but there isn't. It would have been a nice addition, especially considering it looks like its there.Overall, I think this camera was a great purchase, especially considering the price.

It has taken almost no bad shots and lets face it, there is no way any camera is going to take a great picture 100 percent of the time right so why the bad reviews? Ive read them and cannot understand how this camera is not treasured especially for the price..I've gotten so many compliments on my photography because of this camera it's starting to make me wonder if I should be a photographer lol...Seriously though, some of these reviews must be from people who do not know how to operate the camera. For instance my girlfriend tries to take pictures and then immediately gives it back and says you can take better ones..I keep telling her to gently push down the capture button slightly, hold it, then it will focus on what your looking at, after this is done then you push it down the rest of the way after it's focused to take the picture(Hold it steady)...This camera has a 2 step capture, if you just push the button down you will get a bad shot because it's not focused plus it has many many different auto settings like sr auto which will take better shots than normal capture mode...Plus the list of functions on this baby is so long that if your not in the right mode in the right lighting it will take a bad picture...For me it takes wonderful pictures, Ive taken a picture of my daughter in her baby swing while it was swinging on setting 4 which at that point I have to time the shot so I get her in view....BING!!! absolutely clear picture on a moving target!!So how can it take that bad a pictures for so many people?

I caught a single corn stalk over the top of the field and it zoned in on that one stalk and blurred the rest out for one of the best shots i've ever taken....Not to mention the pure fact that this camera for us normal people is the right choice just for the simple fact that it takes perfect pictures indoors and at night!

I spent hours and hours reading reviews. (which aren't always the most reliable since any idiot can buy a product, have not the slightest idea what they're doing with it, and leave a bad review for it online) For days I combed the internet for any and all professional reviews and hardware specs on various brands and models, until finally I narrowed it down between the (VERY) few within our price range. I took her to an electronics shop where they had several demos setup to try and she liked the feel of this one, so that was that.Christmas evening we were both excited to try her new camera. Right out of the box we were impressed with the camera's zoom. Sitting directly across a 20ft room you could zoom in on a small tree ornament and get a super-macro quality shot. We were delighted, until she tried taking pictures of ANYTHING ELSE. I have no idea why, but the camera would not take a clear shot of anything. Of course, I tried adjusting the aperture, ISO, scene settings and all modes, but the problems just became worse and worse. We reached the point where almost every photo came out completely out of focus and red-orange and black, which is a defining sign that your aperture should be adjusted... well, even after restoring all settings to default/factory, the issues never subsided. Now, I know what you're thinking! \"That sounds ludicrous. It must be a defective camera.\" I know, which is why I returned that sonnuvabitch for an exact replacement. Same. Damn. Problem.Now, while my wife has what they call \"the photographer's eye\", she's definitely more of a point-and-shoot kind of person, meaning she wants to see something, point at it, click a button and have a great picture. I, on the other hand have had a bit more experience with the hardware & software of photography. She really wanted to keep this camera and try to troubleshoot it, but I could smell the stench of Fujifilm's bad software in this thing from a mile away, so we returned it a SECOND TIME.Third time's a charm... which is why I said \"F*** that!\" and bought a Canon Powershot SX40 HS. It was more than double what I paid for the Fujifilm, but as anyone who's ever owned a Canon will tell you, there is no substitute. The Canon SX40 HS is by far the best camera we have ever owned. The photos that we get with the Canon are phenomenal! It is capable of zooming in on the moon and capturing a HAND-HELD shot with NASA-grade accuracy. I cannot say enough good things about her new Canon. Stellar right out of the freaking box.Look, bottom line: Stay the hell away from this Fujifilm S3200. Experienced photographers say it's junk. Novice's say it's junk. I'm telling you it's junk. If you're in the market for a new camera, and willing to drop the coin on one of these mid-step DSLR models anyway, why not save a couple more months and get a Canon?

At least indoors. Honestly...I don't even know where to begin. I SO (some pun intended) wanted to love this camera. Everything about it seemed perfect. The zoom range. The ergonomics. The pop up flash. The veiwfinder. The discounted price. The fact that it takes 4 standard AA batteries instead of proprietary, chip-encoded overpriced Li-Ions. I even got it in a kit with a really nice bag and a 4GB Fuji SDHC card. All for $179 at BJ's. I didn't even have to wait for it to arrive. I just drove there, bought it, and brought it home. And that's when things really took a definite turn for the worse.I had been using a Panasonic ZS8 that I'd gotten about a week ago, and I was sure, based on everything I wrote above, that I'd like the Fuji better. In my mind, I had already packed up the ZS8 and sent it back to Amazon, I was so sure I'd prefer the Fuji camera. (I think I even looked at my ZS8 somewhat disparagingly as I was getting ready to test the S3200.)(NOTE: I'd downloaded and read/skimmed the whole 144 page .pdf manual before I started taking any photos with the S3200, so it wasn't as if I was totally unfamiliar with its features.)Then I started taking some casual photos with the S3200, just as I'd done at first with the ZS8 (i.e. zooming in/out, trying photos with and without flash, trying custom settings in the P, S, & A modes, and comparing those shots to the ones taken in Auto mode, etc.). I was photographing the exact same things I'd been photographing with the ZS8, under the exact same conditions. I figured that was the best/fairest way to get an accurate comparsion. I had found the ZS8 to be tolerable-to-fair in low light/no flash settings, and having read the specs and the reviews, I was hoping that the S3200 would be at least as good, if not better.Well...as they say...we live in hope and die in despair. The results were just flat out abysmal. Forget about the photos being grainy. The ones without flash were just total garbage. And before you even ask...I tried every possible setting (except full Manual) to try to get the photos to look even halfway decent. I tried full auto, scene auto, natural light, natural light with flash, A mode, S mode, and P mode. To no avail. It was a total effort in futility. Even the flash shots, which APPEARED at first to be crisp and clear, all had what can best be described as an \"over Photoshopped\" look to them at full 100% magnification on the computer screen. You know what I mean, right? Where ALL the detail has been totally smoothed away. It might pass when you're trying for some kind of super smooth skin look in a glamour shot (but even then it tends to look artificial/unnatural), but for regular snapshots, from a supposedly good camera? I don't think so. I did manage to squeeze out somewhat better results in \"P\" mode, after hitting the proprietary/magic \"F\" button (don't tempt me, it wouldn't take much at this point), and lowering the ISO to 100. But again...it was way too little, way too late.There was also noticeable barrel distortion at the widest zoom setting (24mm focal length) on the S3200, whereas there was no such distortion from the identical shots taken with the ZS8 at the same 24mm focal length. So what good is it to have a 24mm super zoom lens that can't even take a simple, straight, undistorted picture? I didn't even bother taking the camera outdoors. If it can't take a decent picture indoors, what good is it?And as others have noted...it's really SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW to focus (if you can even GET it to focus). Forrest Gump slow. Molasses slow. Just gawd awful slow. It's even slow/sluggish when you're panning to compose the shot. It's like it's panning in semi-slow motion. It's not too slow to recycle after a flash shot. And it is pretty quick to zoom. But that's about it.I took around 100 shots, and maybe got 4 or 5 out of that bunch that were decent/useable. That's just very very sad. And as I stated at the outset...I REALLY wanted to like this camera. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay any shipping to get it here, and I won't have to pay any shipping to get it back.Now some folks might think that giving this camera 2 stars is harsh, because I admit I never even took it outside. But as far as I'm concerned, any camera that can't even take a decent indoor shot without it looking like it'd been Photoshopped to death (with flash), or taken with a black sock over the lens (without flash) is a below average performer, IMO. I will say that in kit form it came with a nice bag, and a nice 4gb Fuji card, and the price was more than reasonable, at least now that it's being discounted rather heavily. But to put your life's memories in the hands of this underperformer just doesn't make much sense to me.The big lesson clearly to be learned from all of this is that you cannot assume that just because a camera has a great spec sheet it's going to take great pictures. There's obviously a lot of stuff going on under that black plastic cover that determines the quality of the final photos; stuff that rarely if ever makes it to the spec sheets. And unfortunately, the Fuji S3200 totally misses the mark.As somewhat of an aside, the S3200 is definitely a smart little sucker. If you happen to turn the camera on without having first removed the lens cap, it'll give you a semi-polite, but stern warning: \"Turn Off The Camera And Turn On Again\". (At least it was polite enough not to say: \"YOU LEFT THE LENS CAP ON, DUMMY!!\") By the same token, it gives no indication whatsoever that the warning is related to the lens cap having been left on. When it first appeared I thought it was something much more serious. (Towards the end of the manual, in the \"Warnings\" section, it does mention that particular warning, but it does not say it has anything to do with the lens caps being on at the time the camera is turns on. I'm assuming that the two are connected since that warning only appeared when the lens cap left was on at the time the camera was turned on, and never appeared when the lens cap was off.) So now it's my turn to offer up a warning: \"RUN DO NOT WALK TO THE NEAREST CUSTOMER SERVICE COUNTER AT BJ'S (or Amazon or wherever) TO RETURN THIS CAMERA!\"(On a more jovial note...I would swear that my Panasonic ZS8 gave me a very smug, disparaging look as I was boxing up the S3200.

I was very happy with my new camera. The features are great and the pictures are excellent. BUT, I had a problem with connecting it to a pc to download my pictures. Yes, I can still take out the card and download them through a card reader but let me finish my story..... I call support after trying multiple usb ports on 4 computers, tried another cord that works fine with another camera.....everything I could possibly think of. So support guy starts at the top of his list and he decides that it has to be a bad connector on the camera so he sends me over to repair for directions on how to get it repaired. They want me send it in for them to determine if it is covered under the 1 year warranty.1st I must pay to ship it to them. If the problem is not covered under warranty,or is deemed wear and tear, I will have to pay the repair fee and return shipping. (to get my brand new camera back). They did say however that if it was covered under warranty they would pay to express ship it back to me(please allow 6-8 weeks.....really....I then asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold for a couple of minutes until \"someone else\" came on the line to immediately explain their return policy that has been in place for over 30 years. They couldn't shut up which is where I got really turned off and is the reason I am writing this review. He said I was lucky that the camera still actually worked that most of the calls they get about this situation come from the connector somehow causing the camera to completely not work. He said that cables are overrated and card readers are the way to go so if I just go buy one, then all of my problems will be solved. He continued to belittle me by strongly suggesting that I caused the problem by trying to put the cable in the wrong way, \" some people don't realize that it only goes in one way\" Really..... again..., I finally thanked him for his time and politely hung up. I said all of that to say this. I like the camera, but the fact that \"at least my camera still worked\" (his words) the second day that I had it didn't give me any warm fuzzies about the overall quality of this camera. They didn't seem to care that the camera was one day old or the fact that I am a \"first time\" FUJI customer. Folks, this camera may be a good one at a good price but its not the only one I can assure you. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FUJI PRODUCT IN MY LIFE...Customer service still means something to me.

While the SR-Auto mode works well in some situations, photos may come out noisy/grainy.The camera can't possibly tell you everything in order to take the shot YOU want. Take some time to learn about aperture,shutter speed, and ISO levels and once venture past SR-Auto mode you'll start to see great results.Focus doesn't work as well as a DSLR especially since there is no manual focus option. Continuous shooting works as described, but the Panorama mode doesn't always stitch the shoots together correctly. I prefer to manually stitch in a photo processing application on my computer but, you can still take quality panoramas using the cameras stitching.I'd recommend this for a photographer of any age that is on a budget, or doesn't quite want to take a step up into the DSLR-level cameras just yet.

The features were easy to use and the pictures looked great!Then everything went horribly wrong!After testing the camera and determining that it functioned as advertised I packed it back up in its box and placed it in the closet until it would be needed.  Eight months later I pulled it out of the box so that a friend could grab some candid photos at our wedding.  Upon powering the camera on the view screen promptly advised that it be turned off.

Here's what he had me do:  Remove the lens cover.When that extensive troubleshooting failed to resolve the problem he advised that I contact their repair department.  Evidently he can't setup a repair for me and he can't transfer me to their repair department because the repair department is only open Monday through Friday.I contacted the repair department and here's the gist of what they said:  \"[just ship it to us with a letter and we'll call you back].\"  Glad I had to call for this info.  Oh, and in case you're wondering how you proved you talked to anyone - you don't.  You just ship that bad boy off to a black hole somewhere and hope for the best.  You've already dropped three bones on this defective doodad so its not like you stand to lose more, right?The camera was delivered to FujiFilm's repair center 1.5 weeks ago and no call.  So I picked up the phone and dialed up that black hole.  They were unable to find the package.  Color me surprised.  The attendant at the black hole advised me that they are behind on their camera repairs, so it could just be that they have not yet scanned it into their system.  <sarcasm> Until now I was unaware that they had a system </sarcasm>So there you go..

Otherwise, the FujiFilm support offered (web, phone and camera software) is really not good, but the camera is good enough for 3 years use and then get a new one if the old one breaks (repair is not an option anymore this days!).In summary, for the price, you'll be ok traveling and if broken you can replace with a newer model, the camera has some nice features and it is easy to use and get good pictures.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.00", "Features": "14 million effective pixels; 1/2.3 inch CCD sensor; 24x optical zoom lens plus approx 6.7x digital zoom\n3.0 inch color TFT LCD monitor plus electronic viewfinder; HD MPEG4 movie 720p with sound\n6 scene SR AUTO recognition; Motion Panorama mode with auto stitch; Auto image rotation in playback\nDual image stabilization; Face and Blink Detection; Smile and Shoot mode; Auto red-eye removal; Tracking auto focus\nUSB 2.0 High-speed; HDMI mini connector; Video output NTSC / PAL selectable; SD/SDHC memory card slot (card NOT included)\n14-megapixel CCD sensor; 24x wide-angle optical zoom lens\nMotion Panorama shooting mode\n720p HD movie capture; mini-HDMI output\nEasy upload to Facebook and YouTube\nCapture images and video to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix S3200 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 24x Super Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510B-QxRSuL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004HO58NY"}}
