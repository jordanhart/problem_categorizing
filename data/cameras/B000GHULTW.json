{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb design with great images, although some noise/detail compromise", "Author": "BJ from Florida", "ReviewID": "R2INRT5RQ8LUIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was definitely NOT disappointed with the camera, after reading so much about it and passing on the LX1 a year ago due to the reports of excessive noise in the images.The camera design of the LX-2 is absolutely superb, with a quality metal body and extremely well thought out feature set. Panasonic has done their homework and solved so many of the design challenges facing point-and-shoot digital cameras. Some will miss a tilting screen or an optical viewfinder, but I don't miss them. Either feature would compromise the current design and the very likeable large 16:9 viewfinder. They've done everything they can to compensate, including an extra-bright mode for the screen and even a high-angle mode that lets you shoot over the heads of a crowd, which accounts for the majority of \"tilted\" shots I've taken with my previous camera, a Nikon with a screen that tilts.I've been waiting for a decent digicam with a true wide angle lens, real 16:9 wide-screen aspect ratio, and widescreen video. It may very well be that this camera is the design future of the industry---hard to believe people wouldn't like this camera over its competitors. Once you start shooting wide-screen, you realize what a natural and creative format it really is.That being said, there are image quality compromises with this camera... in order to solve the noticeable noise in the LX-1, Panasonic opted for strong noise reduction with their Venus III engine, and I can confirm the early reviews: they've reduced noise at a slight loss of very fine image detail and a bit of a watercolor effect at higher ISOs if you examine images at 100% magnification.But on the other hand many consumers are not really going to notice this, the images are really outstanding in the majority of situations, and there are so many megapizels to play with that for many it will simply never be an issue, the way the images are viewed full-size on a monitor or at print sizes up to about 8x10. Most of us aren't as critical as the pros who are doing the reviews. And there isn't a point and shoot out there that has perfect images in every respect, others have flaws like corner softness and purple fringing that the Panasonic doesn't have.Fortunately this camera will shoot in RAW format and allow you to recover nearly all of the original detail, albeit with some work, to really show the superb quality of the Leica lens. But this time around they've bundled halfway decent RAW image processing software, so you actually have the tools to do this without shelling out more money.To be honest, those looking for perfect image quality arguably are the type to be purchasing DSLRs and not high-end point-and-shoots. I think Panasonic may have hit the sweet spot in their target market with this camera.Beware---this camera will only work with 4 GB SD cards that are the newer SD-HC type. Unlike many of its peers, it will NOT work with standard SD 4 GB cards that are formatted FAT32. Panasonic may be deliberately protecting sales of the new 4 GB format. So either go with a standard 2 GB card or the SD-HC 4 GB cards.

During the course of the past 10-12 months I have owned 7, that's SEVEN, digital cameras: Canon S230; Kodak V530; 5 different models of Casio's: Z60, Z600, Z850, P700; and most recently presented my wife with a red S770 for Valentine's Day.  I also had a pretty good chance to evaluate Canon SD450 (my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and I to him for his 21st birthday), Casio EX-S600 (a good friend of mine owns one), and Panasonic DMC-TZ1 (once again, a gift from my wife and I to my father-in-law for his last birthday).  If you read any of my digital camera reviews (and I've written a few by now), then you know that I'm not particularly fond of Canon's lately - I think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer.  As I also mentioned before, I've tried several different Kodak models (and I used to work for the company too!), but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time, to say the least.  I became a big fan of Casio's, although not all of my experiences with them were great.  But being a huge gadget \"freak\" that I am, and constantly wanting new \"toys\", I have always craved for more.  Over time, my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control.  So one by one, I returned/sold all of my cameras, and after extensive (and I really do mean extensive) research, I got myself an LX2.  I must say though that I probably wouldn't have without getting to know my father-in-law's TZ1 first.  I was actually quite impressed with it.  Powerful zoom, sharp lens, decent picture quality.  I also played with some other Panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them, as well as spent a few hours on the phone, and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an FZ30, and who swears by it.  Unfortunately, LX2 was not available anywhere locally, but I felt that I got a pretty good understanding of what Panasonic's cameras are all about, and after some more thought and consideration, I went ahead and bought it from Amazon (nice thing about buying from Amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought, including digital cameras, within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked).  I did know about the \"Noise\" issue at high ISO's, but it wasn't a decisive factor for me, and I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway.  It turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made in a long while.  Here is why:PROS:- Superb design.  This camera is wonderfully crafted.  And I absolutely love Black!  It gives the camera a nice, clean, professional look.  I don't think I'll be buying another silver camera soon after having this one;- Intuitive controls, and menus.  I charged the battery, put it into the camera, and started using it and taking pictures right away, without even going through the manual once;- A load of features, including a large, bright, widescreen LCD; wide angle, super sharp Leica lens with a 4x zoom; Mega OIS - optical image stabilization control (optical means it's done mechanically, which is a TRUE way of doing stabilizing, comparing to other cameras where it's done by \"tricking\" the camera into using higher ISO's); and many more.  In addition, it has a joystick for an easy access to different menus, has a number of manual controls, as well as provides ability to shoot in RAW format (more on that later);- It comes with SilkyPix Developer Studio software for working with camera RAW files.  For someone who is not familiar with RAW - it's a \"pure\", camera specific picture format.  It varies upon a manufacturer, meaning that Canon RAW is different from Nikon or Panasonic RAW, for example.  And it's \"pure\" in a sense that it's of a much better quality than a standard JPEG (JPG), and doesn't suffer from loss of information, such as white balance, or brightness.  There is a lot more to RAW than that, and I'm not going to go into details right now.  What I want to say, however, is that having previously owned a camera which supported RAW format (Casio EX-P700), I must have tried about a dozen of different RAW editing software packages, including products from Adobe, Ulead, ArcSoft, PhotoFiltre, Picture Window Pro, ACDSee, LightZone, Image Broadway, and more. SilkyPix delivered by far the best results of all.  The only one that I would probably put next to it is Bibble;- Noise - What Noise?!  I really hate it when I hear people complaining about noise in this camera (after having it tried myself), or any other compact digital camera for that matter.  Are you really that na\u00efve that you think that you will get absolutely no noise in your images using a compact digital camera?  Think again.  You might have noticed that I've used the word \"Compact\" several times here.  I've done it on purpose - it is inevitable for a compact digital camera to produce some noise.  Some cameras are better than others, but no matter how hard you try, you will see some.  This camera is no better or worse than any other one that I've had/tried.  At higher ISO's (above 400), it's slightly more visible, but who in the right state of mind is using anything over ISO 200 on a compact digital camera, such as this one, anyway?  I always have mine set to a 100.  If I feel that it doesn't get the job done, I shoot in RAW;- Picture Quality is Very Good.  Yes, it does take some time getting used to, but once you familiarize yourself with everything this camera is capable of, you can achieve spectacular results, especially if you don't mind doing some post processing.As much as I like everything this camera has to offer, there are, however, some things that kind of irritate me.  Here is a short list of bad things about this camera, otherwise known asCONS:- First of all, this camera has actually been somewhat misrepresented.  It's been advertised as a 10.2 megapixel camera, which is not entirely true.  10.2 MP resolution is available ONLY in 16:9 (wide) aspect ratio.  Two more ratios are available - 3:2, and a more conventional 4:3, but those offer 8.5, and 7.5 MP resolutions respectively.  So if you compare this camera to others that don't have a widescreen format, or if you prefer to shoot only in a regular 4:3 mode, then this camera should only be referred to as a 7 MP digital camera (because not all the pixels are actually effective).  Obviously, Panasonic is aware of it, and marketed it having higher pixel count on purpose, to boost consumer's interest;- I expected to see a compact digital camera.  What I got instead was actually a smaller compact camera than I expected.  I was really surprised to see how small, yet convenient to hold and operate, the camera body was.  What I didn't like, however, was the lens.  Not the lens itself, it's actually quite superb, but the fact that it sticks out.  I like cameras with lenses that retract all the way back to the camera body.  I realize that it would probably loose some features, like the wide angle, and perhaps zoom, but I still wish it did that.  It would be so much more... umm... compact?!  The way it actually is makes it quite difficult to find the right case for it.  Almost impossible, I should say.  I've tried a few, but they are either too small or too big.  I just can't find one that would fit right.  I put an order for an SLX1B case for it, which is specifically designed to fit LX1, and LX2 models, but I hear they are not that good.  We shall see;- I'm not a big fan of a pop-up Flash.  I always keep forgetting to open it when I need to use it.  And it also seems a bit flimsy.  I'm treating it as carefully as I can, but I just can't stop thinking that it might break soon;- I hate the Lens Cap!!!  There, I said it.  It's probably just one of those small annoyances that keep frustrating you until you get used to it, but for now I'm not really happy with it.SUMMARY:Despite very few minor negatives, I think LX2 is probably one of the best, most innovative cameras on the market today, and I sure am glad to have one.  It offers more than any other camera in the same price range, and can even compete with some DSLR's when it comes to picture quality.  If you are someone like me, who wants to have more control and/or learn more about digital photography, or a DSLR user who just needs a solid backup to carry everywhere, then this camera is not be overlooked!

I'm into taking HDR images (google HDR) and they require several images over a wide exposure (6 - 8+ EV). This camera works fine in both areas, plus it takes w i d e 28mm photos in w i d e aspect ratio so it is what I was looking for. HDR images sum the noise from several photos so they are by nature noisy. I use NEAT IMAGE to clean them up. This is a very nice $500-ish camera. There are better point-and-shoot cameras at that price point but I could find none other that met my own needs.If I were rich I would buy the Leica version; it's supposed to have a different noise curve, but I feel like I got a lot of camera for the money. On the down side, only Photoshop seems to support the panasonic/leica \"raw\" format. I use PS CS2 so I didn't load the not-very-well-reviewed software in the box with the camera. The exposure adjustment requires a lot of button pushing, vice turning a wheel like on SLRs, but it works o.k. for me. If you buy this camera, order the Panasonic case designed for it (I think it's the same as for LX1), it's semi-hard and fits like a glove -- actually providing protection for it.Small, light camera - you'll carry it with you.", "Date": "October 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera for me", "Author": "SL", "ReviewID": "R3OVLF07SKNS7L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a bit hesitant to buy this camera after reading reviews about how it has terrible digital noise. After spending many hours reading, researching, and analyzing online pictures of the LX2 with other comparable digital cameras of the same class, I decided to just get it anyway. My decision was based on several reason:1. I didn't really want to spend more for the similar Leica d-lux 3(usually not in stock at any retail or online stores as of 12/2006), which, according to reviewers have less noise than the LX2 but has softer image quality.2. I wanted a portable camera capable of taking pictures in RAW format, and at the same time gives me full manual control.3. I like the design--classically elegant. Aesthetics are subjective, and I agree that there are sleeker, cooler looking camaeras out there but none has the ability to shoot in RAW.4. I like the 16:9 aspect ratio--great for scenary/nature shots.Here's my take on the camera after having played with it:1. Taking pictures at ISO of 100 and 200 show some noise when zoomed in at 100%, but noise not apparent when viewed at smaller sizes. The noise at ISO 100 and 200 is actually no worse than any other cameras of the same class.2. Great flash. Provides almost perfect lighting while colors stay saturated.3. Amazingly, when images (RAW format) are viewed using their included sofware, the image quality was far inferior to when they were imported and viewed from Photoshop.4. Excellent print quality.-------I wouldn't get this camera if you:1. do a lot of LARGE image printing.2. digitally zooming in and cropping images (LX2's details aren't that great)3. don't mind carrying larger and clunkier cameras like dSLRs4. don't need to shoot in RAW5. feel 16:9 aspect ratio doesn't matter", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera! Very Fun to Use!", "Author": "S. Paci \"Shutterbug\"", "ReviewID": "R23YBC48T06J69", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this camera in late September just as it was released. Initially thought I may have made the wrong choice after reading some complaints about excessive noise but I have not found noise to be much of a problem...PROVIDED that the ISO is kept at 100. Because the camera is so small it is easy to hold steady at slow shutter speeds and I also keep the image stabilization set on #2 (activates only as the shutter button is pressed) to ensure a sharp image. So really there has not been much of a reason for me to use the camera at higher ISOs, but I am thinking it actually might be fun to do this to get some \"grain\" intentionally, particularly on the black & white setting.PLUSES: The 16:9 format is extremely fun to use and makes for some very creative picture taking. You can also quickly move to 3:2 or 4:3 formats with a quick flip of a switch on the lens barrel.The controls are well designed and placed and are simple to use if you have owned previous digital cameras. Manual settings are easily controled via a small joystick. Build quality (mostly metal body) also seems excellent.I have seen several complaints about the picture quality of this camera, but to me the quality seems comparable to my last digital, a Canon Powershot S-80. I suspect many of the complaints arise from users who do not keep the ISO set to 100.Macro setting works extremely well. This is quickly controlled by a swtich on the side of the lens barrel.Took some candid shots at a party and the flash performed quite well. In shutter priority mode, I set the shutter speed to 125, forced the flash on and boosted it a bit. Play around with it a bit and you will find settings that work for you. Skin tones were rich and not washed out.Various focus options are very helpful. I shoot alot of landscapes so I don't always want the primary focus on the center of the photo. I usually leave the camera set on the nine-point focus setting, which picks up multiple points in the frame and takes an average. By pressing the shutter button halfway, you can preview which of the nine fields the camera will use to gauge the focus and switch to another setting if necessary.This is the only digital camera I have ever seen that offers fine tuning of the white balance. It is like having a set of filters built right in to the camera! Super!Images can be cropped right in the camera! This is the first camera I have seen that offers this option.MINUSES: As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, you are only getting the full 28mm view when you use the 16:9 format.There is no viewfinder and the LCD screen can be EXTREMELY hard to see in bright sunlight. The camera offers a \"Power LCD\" setting which lightens the screen and helps in certain conditions, but often I find myself trying to compose a shot while looking at a reflection of myself on the screen.That's about it. I haven't really put this puppy through all it's paces or used all it's features yet, but I've used it enough to be able to say that I am very pleased with my purchase. The camera is on the expensive side and its advanced features will probably be best appreciated by advanced amateurs or even pros who want something small they can always have with them.", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA", "Author": "Michael J.

Recently I wanted something better than what I had for an upcoming trip to Italy and I bought the Lumix DMC-LX2 on Amazon after reading reviews, etc.It is no SLR, but it is far more than a \"back-up\" camera.  It is small enough to be handy without being a burden.  (A friend we were travelling with had a digital SLR with a 135mm zoom.  She had it in her bag most of the time because it was so big and heavy.)The lens quality is very good.  The absence of a traditional view finder is very nice.  The TV screen on the back works in all lighting conditions (its adjustable).  You can have as little or a lot of the technical data on the screen as you want.  It even has a couple of nice composition templates that I found useful at times.I bought one of the after market batteries and couple of 2 gig cards and I had far more capacity than I needed for a 2 week trip, but the second card is necessary if you shoot at max pixels as I did the whole time.  At max jpg a 2 gig card holds about 350 shots.  One battery was all I needed so long as I watched the charger carefully at night.  Sometimes the current converter one has to use in Italy would shut down mid-charge.  So my advice is to have a second battery and switch them out.This camera is very versatile.  It will do a lot if one takes the time to study the manual.  (The manual is not the best, however)  The SLR's do beat out its zoom, but that is not much of a problem for casual shooting because one can crop the tar out of the 10.1mg shots and still have a great photo.The flash works fine.  And one can fill flash with it.  I bought a small slave unit that works great but I never needed it.I found a handy, cheap, case at REI.  They have a padded cell phone case that hooks up to a belt or a back pack.  This camera fits the REI case perfectly.  It even has side mesh pockets for batteries and chips.

The Macro pictures are of very high resolution and depth of field, it is easy to take exellent pictures of Butterflies, even when they are moving a lot.  I never had any problems with the noise even in low light. It seems that people just get on a bandwagon and shout without having a real experience of the facts themself.  It helps a lot to adjust the camera for the task, for example, adjust the whitebalance even on a sunny day, might make a lot of difference.  I am selling my DSLR camera, because this one is a lot easier to use, and it does not produce any camera shake, like that high speed mirror does in the SLR.  After taking almost 600 pictures, I like it and would buy this camera again. I wish it had a way to connect an external flash, but that is not a great problem, I am using one that has a sensor, and fires when the built in flash does. this works great, because it gives much better pictures than just using a built in flash by itself. It is also very handy, that the flash stayes locked up when taking pictures in Museums etc.  I have compared the pictures with other cameras of the same class, of the more popular brands, and I think I get better pictures than most.

I travel alot and sometimes due to space and sometimes due to the desire to be inconspicuous I have needed something smaller than my full size SLRs.  After a lot of research, looking at every model I could find, I settled on this Panasonic Lumix LX2 because I don't have to give up the control over every aspect of the photo. This camera lets you be a control freak, or you can leave it in one of several automatic modes.  It can store pictures in RAW mode, which is important to me (the Canon G7 lost out because it didnt have this) but the JPEG mode is great.  I have blown up some prints from this camera and I am completely satisfied with the quality, and I was skeptical before, expecting to be underwhelmed.I originally bought this as a backup to my SLRs but I already see this will be my primary camera unless I am a situation that calls for  a special lens, flash power, or super high resolution (like 25 or 60 ASA)My only suggestion to Panasonic would be to allow you to charge the battery while in the camera, like with a car charger, and make some sort of accomodation for external flash.

Blanchette \"Little Canuck\"", "ReviewID": "R1XQ4HPG7K0VKS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this little camera when I bought it, but after scrutinizing the quality of its output, I have decided to return it. I spent days reading the professional and user reviews before ordering. Despite consistent complaints about high ISO noise, I proceeded to order it anyway because most of my shots are taken at a safe ISO 100 (so I thought). I should also say that I own a Canon Powershot S80 and a Nikon D80 dSLR, so the bar was already raised pretty high when I got the LX2.I love almost everything about this camera. The small size is perfect, the controls are handy, and the ergonomics are great. I also found that the quality of the JPG images are very good at ISO 100. It seems to me that the onboard noise reduction algorithm does a great job.Now for the problem. I bought the camera mainly for its RAW support. The nice Leica 28mm lens and the 10MP resolution were also important factors. I had planned to take RAW exclusively (as I do with the D80). In that light, the LX2 looked like a potential dream for amateurs like me who love control and quality combined with portability.But in test shot after test shot, the noise in the RAW images was terrible. Even on nice sunny days, the sky was blotchy in the RAW photos. Even with post-processing using Neat Image (which does a superb job at reducing noise), I could never match the quality of the JPG photos. Neat Image was able to reduce the noise but the cost was a corresponding loss of detail and clarity. I could never get around this devastating compromise.My bottom-line conclusion is that there is no advantage to taking RAW photos with this camera, since the result is generally less desirable than the JPG images processed on the LX2. This is an unusual conclusion perhaps, but it means that onboard noise processing does a good job on the JPG images. Unfortunately, the other conclusion is that the high noise left in the RAW images is hard to remove, leading to compromised images most serious amateurs find unacceptable.If you intend to shoot in JPG only and at low ISO settings, the camera has many plusses and I'd recommend serious consideration because everything else about this camera is well done. But if you intend to shoot RAW, be sure to closely study the consequences of heavy post-processing on the images.

Raw files are huge, and it takes several seconds to write to the SD card.  It's a pity that Panasonic didn't provide a memory buffer to reduce this rather frustrating delay.Image quality is good at ISO 100, but noise is apparent at ISO 200 and above, and the in-camera noise reduction only makes things worse in my opinion, sacrificing too much detail in order to eliminate the noise.

I've taken photos with this camera that look better than ones taken with a Pentax, Olympus, or Sony SLR and are right on par with the Rebel xti and Nikon D40 SLR cameras. I literally went outside and took pictures of the same flower at the same time of day with the exact same camera settings on all the cameras and this camera produced that kind of quality. It's all in the lens!This little gem manages to have both an awesome lens and high megapixels in a small package. I have umpteen customers a day come into my place of business asking about megapixels, megapixels, megapixels. I try to tell them that the *LENS quality* is as important as the megapixels. You can get a 5 megapixel camera with an awesome lens and get an awesome photo. You can also get a 12 megapixel camera with a really cheap lens and get a really lousy photo.Now, there are some drawbacks, of course, as there are with any camera. If you are primarily shooting hummingbirds, sunsets, & diners in cozy bistros, then this is not the camera for you. The low light images can be noisy at high ISOs. I just try not to shoot at a high ISOs. Even in low light I can put the camera into the manual mode and manipulate the settings to take a good shot at ISO 200. (need a tripod!)While the camera has a minimal shutter lag and a burst mode, you won't quite be able to capture a 90 mph fast ball in mid-air the way you would with an SLR. However, I don't really know of any point-and-shoot that can keep up with an SLR when it comes to frames per second. I've successfully taken pictures of a greyhound in full stride, though, and that's pretty impressive. If it can keep up with the greyhound, then it can probably keep up with the grandchildren too. :)The zoom can be a tad frustrating at times. If they update it I hope they make the optical zoom about 6x instead of 4x, but you can always do some cropping after the fact.The macro shots are just amazing. I've uploaded some of them here. I took pictures of a tiny 3 inch long lizard and you could even see little nicks and scars in his skin.If you shoot in the 16:9 mode you can get a nice wide angle shot. You'll need to print it as a 4x7 to get the entire image but it's worth it if you go someplace like the Grand Canyon.One last thing I would note: I've had this camera almost since it was released and it hasn't really depreciated in value. The price has remained at the $[...] mark for over a year. Just like cars, most digital cameras immediately lose value almost from the minute you buy them because so many new models come out each year. Since it has the Leica lens, I think the resale on this camera is going to remain pretty good, making it a decent investment as far as point-and-shoot cameras go.Bottom line: if you are looking for a pocket camera to supplement your SLR, then I say look no further than this one.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Panasonic LX2 ( black)", "Author": "Mark Power", "ReviewID": "R2VAT7LIA005OH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic LX2 is is a cunning little camera, jewel-like, and well designed ( I have the black version) and Ive shot about 1000 pictures with it and so far gotten some excellent photographs.

The menus are easy to use and quick. Now for the issue of noise.yes, it's noisy at speeds much over 100. But there's good noise and there's bad noise and this camera has good noise. It reminds me of Tri-X grain and on some shots I've deliberately shot at over 100 to get that 'look'. Which to my mind just adds to the versatility of the camera. I also have a Sony RSC R1 and now that has become my 'view' camera which I take out when on shooting sessions. The LX2 is my '35mm' camera which I carry with me daily and get shots I wouldn't get with the larger Sony.Those are the pluses - the negatives: it's so small I'll probably lose it like I do with my cell phone frequently. it's also somewhat slippery; I wish it had a leather finish for a better grip.(I guess I will get a case.) With a standard SD card and using RAW ( another plus) it's not fast. But neither am I so that's not a problem. I wish I could set the flash intensity on RAW and RAW also doesn't support bracketing. ( My Sony does both on RAW). The battery could use a bit of beefing up but I've been spoiled by the Sony battery which never seems to lose a charge. I don't find the stabilization to be all that great  probably because the camera is so small. I used to have a Minolta A2 and that stabilization worked a lot better. But it was a bigger heavier camera. The Sony doesn't have that feature and doesn't seem to need it - again a heavier camera.Wishes for the LX3Tilt & swivel  viewing screenLess noise at higher ISOsMore menu options for RAW settingsColor mode options ( Adobe RGB)better batteryI haven't tried out the burst shooting or the video capabilities.", "Date": "November 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Keroro", "ReviewID": "R2AHUYUKZZKVEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you take all of your pictures in auto mode, than this is not a camera for you!

It looks like a serious camera, and it is.  Yet it also has a lot of fun features that belie its conservative aesthetic, most notably its native 16:9 format.The build quality is excellent; it is small but solid.  The screen is sharp and bright.  It is quite reflective, however, and there is no optical viewfinder, so in bright conditions it can be a little hard to see the screen's image but this is mostly alleviated by Panasonic's thoughtful incorporation of a \"high-power\" and \"high-angle\" contrast setting, for which there is a dedicated button (eliminating the need to drill down into menus).Image quality is extremely good for a camera of this size, especially after you set the Noise-Reduction to \"low.\"  The metering is very reliable--so far it has tackled every challenge I've thrown at it.  Colors are accurate, especially at the lower ISOs.  White balance seems a little on the warm side to me, but the camera allows you to adjust this manually--which is quite easy to do thanks to the LX2's useful mini-joystick.The wide-screen function is a lot of fun to use.  So many new composition possibilities avail themselves with the native 16:9 format.  The camera allows one to be quite creative---and to see framing in a new light.My only complaint with this camera is that changing the ISO is not as easy as I would like (it requires three button clicks).  Also, in macro mode, the flash casts a fairly large shadow--but this is not a problem in the lens' normal zoom range, which is what I use most of the time.  These are very small complaints, however, and overall I am very pleased with this camera.  It is a well-made product that looks high-quality and is.Also worth noting: the manual is clear, well thought-out, and comprehensive though perhaps just a little too condensed.If you're looking for something inbetween a Point-and-Shoot and a dSLR, this may be the camera for you.

Heltsley", "ReviewID": "RWQOHUHGB899K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was wary about this camera after reading the FUD on it about all the noise.  In 98% of the shots it is not a problem.  With my other 4 digital cameras over the years noise has been a minor issue, some more than others.  In this camera it is less of an overall concern because the resolution is so high that it is easy to overcome the noise with Noise Ninja if it gets out of control and still have enough resolution to print easily up to and even larger than 8x10.I wanted a dSLR but cannot justify that cost (at least 2x the LX-2) to myself much less my wife.  That plus I did not want a camera that I could not put in a pocket when I wanted to.  That meant that it was this or the Cannon G7.  Either way there were tradeoffs.  The G7 is bigger and bulkier so it was less of a fit than this one and it did not do RAW.  That leaves this bad boy.I cannot be happier with my purchase.  I have taken amazing pictures with it, I have been able to control things that in my other cameras were beyond my reach, such as both f stop and shutter time simultaneously.  Plus it takes true widescreen shots and has easy to use easy to find external buttons instead of onscreen menus.  It offers crystal clear images and amazingly sharp focus and it has oodles of control over that focus.  I like that level of control.  As I learn more about photography it is clear that more control is a good thing, however with that being said the camera does almost always make the right choises in far less time than I do.  But the fact is I have the option to change it as I see fit.All in all noise is not a problem if you steady your shots, which you should do anyhow if you want sharp images on any camera.  It is not a problem even with the noise filter and sharpening set to low (you cannot turn them off).  When it is a problem Noise Ninja has saved the day without ruining the shot.  Simply running it on the luminescence channel and not on the color generally preserves nearly 100% of the detail too.If you want to make HUGE shots, so far my best shots have been made into 4'by 3' (that is 48\"x36\") and they look beautiful, you will love this camera.  If you plan to make all your shots that big get a dSLR since this camera will likely disappoint you on some shots.  I even print real 16\"x 9\" from 11\"x 17\" paper, of course you need a printer that can handle that and you need to cut the final down to size, but you get the point.I am not going to say this is the best camera, but it is a great one.  One that I am happy to own, one that I am happy to show people and one that I am not ashamed of the image quality of.  For all those people out there who complained about the noise it is obvious to me that they either knew too little about digital photography to start with or they were expecting a dSLR in a compact camera body.  Either way they were wrong to call this camera out from the pack on its noise issue.  I have edited photos from friends and family for the last several years and I see no more noise on average in my shots (even at 400% magnification or more) than in those from other cameras.  I see about the same now that I got in my original 2MP Nikon Coolpix something or other, in my 4MP Canon Elph or in my 5MP Sony P100.  However I have to say my wife's Fuji FinePix F30 is a completely different animal.  The pictures from that are as noise free as I have ever seen, a bit soft at times, but noise free.  If Fuji could somehow produce the image sensor for the LX-2 it would be the greatest non SLR camera ever made. I am not going to tell you noise is not a problem, because it is under certain circumstances.  For example high contrast or bad lighting both produce what seems like more noise than my previous cameras had.  However the resolution in these circumstances means that while I may have more noise I can remove it and still have as much detail or more than what I got with my 5MP camera with 0 noise.  To me this is still OK.  I have not been stopped from printing any shots at 8x10 due to noise.  That is alright by me.  Also I never shoot in anything other than ISO 100 unless I am in a mode that does not allow me to control it.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera.

It was (and still is) an OK camera but its widest angle was too narrow for good scenic shots.  The LX2 has a very wide angle capability with easy switching to three different formats; 4:3, 3:2 and 16:9.  The 16:9 format allows eye-popping panoramic shots.  The 4X optical zoom is more than enough for distance shots, but with the camera's high resolution, it is easy to crop the target in Photoshop, giving equivalent results of a much greater zoom capability with little loss of practical resolution.  The image stabilization is nice, I guess.  So far I have not really needed IS, so I can't say if it is effective or not.I recently took some indoor photos of groups of people in a lecture room.  I had intended to use the flash but after I saw what I got from the first shot without flash, I did the whole run of shots without flash, and the photos are excellent.  The large LCD monitor is a big help in framing shots and reviewing images afterwards.  This is my first camera without a see-through viewfinder, but that had not been a problem.So what is there not to like?  Only two gripes so far.  The camera body has only one attachment point for the provided carrying strap with a short cord.  I liked the shoulder strap that was provided with my old C-5000 and the short LX2 strap proved to be somewhat inconvenient during four days of shooting in Washington, DC.  I am hoping to find an after-market shoulder strap that can be fitted to the LX2.The final gripe is that the LX2 automatic file naming system is strictly sequential.  With the old Olympus C-5000, the day and month were encoded into the file name.  That was truly convenient.I consider myself to be an amateur photographer.  The LX2 has tons of capabilities and controls that I will probably never use.  For my purposes, the LX2 does everything I ever expect it to do.

I don't mind the lens-cap rather than an automatic option, and while it's not the smallest out there, it's good enough for me.The body feels like it's of fairly good construction, although the first (and so far only) accessory I bought was a screen protector - a MUST if it's going to go into your pocket.I didn't like the on-screen menus, but I can live with them. They're not so bothersome as to be a deal breaker.My main interest in this camera was the Leica made lens - as some may know, this camera is IDENTICAL to a more expensive Leica, as the design is a joint collaboration between Panasonic and Leica. The selectable aspect ratios(4:3, 3:2, 16:9) are great, and the 28mm wide angle at 16:9 is impressive for a camera of this size.One thing that was pleasantly surprising was the quality of the video. Although when shooting in HD you can only achieve 15 frames per second, the overall quality boost from shooting in HD made up for lower frame rates.As others have already said, the main problem with this camera is that the images are substantially noisier at high ISOs than one might otherwise expect. In broad daylight this isn't a problem, and for snapshots and nothing \"professional\", it doesn't strike me as a problem. For serious work however, it will likely be an issue.Comparing images from this camera to my Canon Digital Rebel XT also reveal that the dynamic range(the range between absolute black and absolute white) is far more limited than I was expecting. While that's not a huge problem in itself, it's something that a studious photographer should at least be aware of before they press the shutter release.In the end, it is what it is, a point and shoot camera with wide angle, 16:9 aspect ratio capability.

Just be sure to order a one gig or bigger card when you get the camera and you'll be fine.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Brilliantly flexible and capable", "Author": "Kennedy Brandt \"Homeworld\"", "ReviewID": "R3SNRJS5JP5XIZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary:  An innovative and stunningly capable compact at a reasonable price with control options usually found only in SLRs.Pros:  \"Wide\" implementation in almost every way;  flexible use of sensor and aspect ratios to maximize zoom, resolution, and framing options;  well-organized UI;  classic camera styling;  widescreen (16x9) display;  Leica lens is too manly to be confined to a pocket.Cons:  Leica lens is too manly to be confined to a pocket;  manual is almost laughably bad;  very little room to actually grip the camera without hitting some controls;  less-common Micro-USB connector;  controls are too tiny for the large-fingered.I needed a replacement for my dying Canon PowerShot S230 Digital Elph.  Priorities were an excellent lens, 28mm or better wide angle, small enough to fit in a pocket, respectable resolution (8mp or better), and some at least some degree of manual control.  I didn't need another SLR, but the flexibility of my wife's Canon EOS 5D meant a basic point-and-shoot simply wouldn't do.The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 nailed my requirements on everything but size.  The body is actually more compact than it tends to look in most pictures, but that lens housing makes it awkward in anything but the most bulky pocket...  and even then, people are likely to ask, \"Is that an LX2 in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?\"I can't even ding it on size that much, because for the quality of the Leica lens it's an acceptable compromise.  It's not bad industrial design;  on the contrary, it's probably the smallest it could be with a lens like that.I'd read up and was aware of the noise (and noise-reduction) problems at higher ISOs, but the way I plan to use it I don't anticipate that will be a problem.  At the same time, the flash almost seems like a \"why bother\" afterthought.  It's miniscule, dwarfed even by the small pop-up housing that springs it into place.The worst part of the entire package is the manual.  It reads like a web site that has all the useful, detailed information on a remote link -- except that here, that means it's on a page further back.  The rest of the content is rife with vague disclaimers on all the ways your pictures might look lousy or things you might think are a malfunction but aren't.  It's almost comical.  More than half of page 46, for example, is indirect, oh-by-the-way commentary that could easily and more clearly be integrated into the main instructions for each feature.  It's as if Panasonic Tech Support got a shot at the manual and just threw every issue that has ever generated a call or e-mail into it.But that's okay.  This isn't a camera for beginners or casual point-and-shooters, and photo enthusiasts may find the manual entertainingly bad.I do find that the noise reduction is a bit too aggressive, leading to the notorious watercolor effect, so I'll generally keep this at its lowest setting and shoot at the highest ISO possible.The only downside to the widescreen display is that it takes up so much of the back of the camera that there's very little room to actually hold the camera.  Further, the control buttons are very small.

Unfortunately none of it makes up for the big detraction from the new LX3 whichis the radically shortened Zoom range which I miss a lot.You just can't move in on a subject like you could with the LX2 and therefore must do it with software after you have taken the picture. The camera is also slightly larger than an LX2 and unfortunately Panasonic decided to continue with the very annoying lens cap design for lens protection.If they are going to make us use a lens cap why then would they make us buy a special adapter just to add a filter to the end of the lens.The lens sticks out anyway so let us screw a filter on it without adding even more length of an extra adapter barrel.Another annoying carryover is if you decide to use the video recordingmode you still cannot zoom the lens while shooting video.And why are video clips limited to ten minutes when you use a multi-gigabyte card that could record for much longer ?

I ordered mine from JM Group and I am so happy with them, I wish I could order everything from them. They charged a very reasonable price especially for the black (k) model. They packaged it very well and shipped it right away.  Now, about the fine camera.  Leica lens- very very sharp.  I've been shooting everything below ISO 100 and no problem with noise. It makes a lot of sense to me to stay below ISO 100 on the compact cameras.  It has user friendly manual settings for example, format ratios (4:3,3:2,16:9),  I am quite satisfied with the zoom range because I like a reasonable wide angle for scenery (which works quite nicely with the 16:9 ratio) and I take a lot of close up portraits.  OK  here's more on manual settings: It has Aperture priority, Shutter priority, fully automatic,manual and more.  I set it on SNOW setting in Scene mode and it took fabulous photos of snow scenes with excellent color.  Image stabilizer enables me to use slower shutter speeds and still get sharp photos.  Don't worry, if you forget to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on, it will let you know to remove the lens cap and then press the appropriate button to fully extend the lens. There is also a manual setting for macro which takes very sharp close ups.  I ordered an excellent soft case directly from Norman Camera.  Tamarac Dig 5692.  They recommend the Tamarac Dig 5691, but it is a bit too tight for my liking.  This camera has the same robust battery cover as the Panasonic lx1 (which I also own). The lens does not fully retract and it has a lens cap.  This doesn't bother me at all.  If I want a lens that fully retracts, then I would have to give up some very desired qualities of this camera.  NO WAY!  I am not a professional photographer, but I have owned some very fine cameras such as Leica M2 rangefinder, Leicaflex, Contax 139 quartz  with Zeiss lens.  I have a real sense for quality and this Panasonic DMC LX2 is  excellent quality in construction, appearance and performance.  The Silver model seems to be much more available and often $200 or even $300 less.  But, who cares!  The silver model is quite handsome and is the SAME camera.A few general comments on the LX3.  I owned one for a brief time. Same quality as LX2 except for the cheaply constructed battery cover on LX3 (Shame on you Panasonic!). As I remember, it zooms 35mm equivalent of 24mm to 60mm.  Not good for portraits.  You can purchase attachment lens to make it even more wide angle (to 35mm equiv of 18mm).  I know that macro gives very sharp focus.  It is being sold for way over Panasonic Suggested retail price by some companies and is on back order. It takes a  49mm filter but you have to purchase and use an extension to use the filter (big hassle). If you are really into wide angle and not into portrait, it is probably the camera for you.  Again, the silver often goes for much less than the black.

I had taken the specs to a local camera shop and tried to see what they had to compare ... all he showed me was Leica's at around 8 Megapixel (and they can't even do the high def video!)... so I was like - well guess I am getting this Panasonic then!The video features are truly awesome ... this could just be one step better with 60 frames per second, but 30 frames per second ROCKS!  Yes, this does high definition at 10 frames per second ... so if you are not taking a video of much at high speed then it is really quite nice ... the only downside is that there is not really a direct cable to patch it up to my HDTV to watch it ... so I am unsure if it is true high def - yet.I have only had this cam a week or two ... I had to wait for my larger memory SD cards to come to my house so I was using the 13 MB internal for a short time and it was still sufficient - although you could only take like 3 pictures. :)I would recommend a cam of this stature to anyone ... even my work peeps that are highly into electronic gadgets are impressed.  I would have to say this is worth every penny.  I will just have to spend some more time now and go through my 140-page manual to check out all the other cool tricks this cam has up the sleeve.AAAAA++++++++  PANASONIC!!!!  WHO-HOO ...p.s.

This is the same camera as the Leica, but at a considerably lower price.Minuses: I wish it had an optical viewfinder. In bright sunlight the LCD screen is almost useless. Flash is underpowered. I wish the lens retracted into the body, as it is difficult to find a small case that will fit it. It would also have made it more pocketable. I bought this unit so that I could have a camera with me all the time, It is a bit too big to comfortably fit into my shirt pocket.

Most of my street images are superb.PICTURES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE WHEN THE EXPOSURE IS JUST PERFECT. I cannot really tell the difference which ones were taken by Lumix and which ones by Canon 40D.  (As a fine art photography major in college, I am very critically of the image quality.)Cons: Wish this camera had an automatic open/closure cap; I don't like the little metal thing  that you push to the right/left to turn on/off the camera. Why didn't they come with up a recessed push button?; The battery seems to run out quick; the camera has RAW option all right but a RAW image is as big as 16MB.

After 1 month (!), I get letter from the service center asking about my credit card information - ignoring the fact that I included letter with the camera describing the failure and including my credit card infoo for charging the repair. So it took them 1 month to ask me for information they already have. Fast forward another month, for those of you that paid attention - 2 months! have now passed since they got the camera. They send the camera back with a packsheet, listing my exact failure description and the remark: tested all functions, no failure found! In other words they did NOTHING, charge US$112.00 to my credit card for this and the zoom lever is still stuck. Every idiot can notice this if trying to operate the zoom.

It's really a great pocket camera.Once I received my camera, I began a series of test shots to get familiar with it's characteristics. Immediately, I was dismayed to discover a spherical distortion just off center, easily visible whenever shooting a plain background, common here in Seattle in the winter. In other words, it sure wasn't sun flair, and was always exactly in the same spot. I called Panasonic hoping they would send me a new camera, which is what I would have done, but understood when they sent me a UPS label to forward it to their repair center near Chicago, since they have to see for themselves.I packed up a bunch of images with the defect pointed out, and handed it to my friendly UPS driver the first week of November, and waited. Finally, I called Panasonic's repair service before Thanksgiving, seeing that the camera had been delivered by UPS the week before, only to find it hadn't been recorded as yet. The agent was extremely pleasant, and I was understanding with the holiday coming as it did. I called again the Monday after the Holiday, and a very helpful agent said she would walk it through, and to call Friday, but that the part would have to come from Kent, Washington - 5 miles from my home, but thousands of miles from Chicago. I called today, Friday, and my new camera still sits in Chicago waiting for parts that may get there by Monday, but the nice agent said if they couldn't get it out by the Holidays, they would send me a loaner.
