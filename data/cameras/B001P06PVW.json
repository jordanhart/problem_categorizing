Lightweight, yet 12 MP, very easy setup and operation.  the 7x zoom is excellent and the super-macro is amazing.  You can take photos from less than an inch.  The 3-in viewer is crisp and bright, the controls are well positioned and I was able to start using most features without reading the manual.  The in-camera editing is nice and the quality of the images is excellent.  The only thing necessary that is not in the box is a memory card.  You will need a xD picture card (Olympus, Fuji, Sandisk) or a microSD card that fits into the adapter.  Versatile camera, highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "J. Baty", "ReviewID": "R21CBKPFMAMXQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One thing I don't like is the way it deletes. This camera is great, I only use one setting which is sport mode. It doesn't need any other setting. Even under the stars in Or. set it on a tripod taking pictures of stars and the moon with the sports mode. I've been off work traveling for almost a year. I've dropped this camera multiply times. Left it on the dash board of my truck. I'm not very good at taking care of cameras, I don't use the case for this one. This camera is a \"WOW\". The big screen that hasn't scratch yet. The marco and super marco is amazing. I've messed up cameras taking them to the beach but no problems so far. I have an Olympus E-510 and it's trash to me compared to this one", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it, would not marry it", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Lar E\"", "ReviewID": "R1I2C88G4KYXTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the resolution, hate the placement of the picture mode wheel.

Mickiewicz", "ReviewID": "R2I9XC0TNLLASQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually just lost my camera :( and after reading up on other cameras out there, I will be buying the exact same one. The pictures are very clear, the color is nice, battery life is really good, extremely portable, and the videos are pretty good. I read a professional review somewhere that said that if you take a lot of pictures indoors that this camera was not for you. Well, I am no professional but I have taken a LOT of indoor pictures & they all turned out great. In fact, my husband is in Afghanistan for the next year so I have literally taken 100s of pictures of my son over the past 5 months & I have absolutely LOVED the picture quality indoor & out.My one complaint is that picture-to-picture time is a little slow (meaning that you take one picture & it takes a minute to let you shoot another). I also enjoyed the mode where the camera kept shooting as long as you held down the button (so when you flip through the pictures it's like watching a slow-mo video - this allows you to get every single shot), but picture quality was not as good in that mode. I've looked into other cameras in this price range & slightly higher but MANY reviews say that the picture quality is lacking. Even with my few complaints about this camera, picture quality is great & that is why I will be buying it again.I am obviously not a professional, or even close to it, just an average person looking for an easy to use camera with good picture quality. But if you are a professional or someone who really dabbles in photography, you should probably be getting a more expensive camera anyway. For an average joe, and for what you pay, this is an excellent camera!", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Indestructible", "Author": "Liz M.", "ReviewID": "R3RH4R6SS23N84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

This was the advice but i have to choose my own.I want camera that have a great features but at affordable prise. I searched too many camera for as per my requirement. and I got this camera's webpage.At first, prise was high, but after sometimes it suddenly dropped. Its panorama feature is totally awesome. and i decided to purchase Olympus stylus 7000.And I'm really satisfied with it. It is light-weighed and has Good battery,  nice effects. these all are good things about that..Now there is just one bad thing that i have experienced is after taking photo, you have to wait sometime to take another.otherwise its easy to use. and recommended by me.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazon camera buy", "Author": "Marlene", "ReviewID": "RDMI1YLWHLW8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Olympus camera.  First one chewed by new puppy, second one dropped and really destroyed.  This one has lots of features I probably will not use but I am very happy with the features I do use.  The 'Beauty' feature is something else, erasing wrinkles.  Everyone I have showed this feature to have taken down the name of the camera.  I think that would sell the camera alone.  Now if it could also take 10 pounds of the subject ........The only thing I don't like about all three cameras are how cheaply made they seem to be.  But, that seems to be the problem with whatever brand you buy.In all I would recommend this camera and already have.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Olympus Stylus Cameras Are Best", "Author": "Erin G. \"foureyes\"", "ReviewID": "R2XCNWQ9ABQWYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera to replace a camera that was stolen, and have to say that Olympus definitely makes the best cameras. Though many friends and family members have problems with difficult to program and use cameras, I have never had a problem with mine. This camera is lightweight, pretty, and takes an amazingly clear picture. The controls are easy to figure out and I like the software that comes with the camera.The only negatives are you need to buy a memory card separately and the buttons are not made for large fingered people.", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "This camera is a keeper", "Author": "N.
