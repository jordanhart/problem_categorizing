{"Reviews": [{"Title": "THREE YEAR UPDATE (Lot's of features, few weaknesses, good price)", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R37MLLPNQFI6NS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THREE YEARS LATER -- A REVIEWI have now taken 9,800 photos with this camera!DURABILITY: It has been bumped, dropped and exposed to hostile climates for extended periods of times (The camera has spend most of it's life in Arabia with severe temperatures, dust and high humidity.) but no real horror stories like falling down concrete stairs. Still, it works fine.SOFTWARE: I have totally given up with the bundled software. I tried to use it but it just was a pain. However, both the stills and video are perfectly computable with everything.FIRMWARE (aka feature): I never ever use the digital zoom feature.  There's not point to it, that I can see. It's better just to crop it with your home software.I really don't use ANY of the firmware features except review and -- rarely -- delete if I am running out of memory.MPEG MOVIE MODE -- very nice!  Of course the picture quality is limited but the sound is terrific, making it a rewarding viewing experience. It is a wonderful tool for putting short clips on the web for the grandparents. With my hosting service (Photobucket), I can just upload the native file.START UP TIME: This cameras is still faster in the start-up time than some newer cameras (especially when the batteries are fresh.) I love that.HARDWARE:THAT DANG RUBBER FLAP! That little rubber flap still annoys me. IT NEVER STAYS ON!  Sometimes I scotch tape it but mostly it just bothers me. I almost never use those connectors and have considered cutting it off and covering it with duct tape -- except that now-and-again I use the AV out.I really like the flash features -- I use nearly all the modes fairly often -- accept red eye reduction. I love how easy it is to switch between flash modes. No all cameras are that way.The auto-timer is also very easy to use.Auto focus almost never is wrong. It probably helps that there is no telephoto.3.2 PIXELS is almost always enough. It means you can't severely crop your pictures. I now routinely use professional digital printing and have even done 5x7s which look great. 4x6s and web photos are very nice.COLOR: When I compare professionally printed 4x6s with our old Olympus 35mm point-and-shoot camera, the film still wins (not by a lot) However, for the web, the Sony is much better than scanned prints from the Olympus.BATTERY life is OK -- but not great. You will probably want to travel with an extra set. However, the fact that these are AAs means you can easily buy a set anywhere in the world, as needed.  The supplied NiMH's seem to be getting weak but I still use them.THE SCREEN -- IT is OK but not nearly as good as modern screens. Mostly, I use the viewfinder for shooting.  Except on bright days, the screen is fairly useful but it can be hard to tell if someone's eyes are closed.WHAT I WANT FOR MY NEXT CAMERA:* I want a real (mechanical) telephoto. I miss that the most.* I want an optical viewfinder (many of the new cameras don't have them) but also one of those large bright screen. It is great to have either option.* I want video. I have learned to really like taking video clips for sharing on the web.* I want a camera that uses standard AAs. This has come in so-handy for long trips since I can leave the charger home and just buy them along the way. But, at home, I use NiMH- - - - -ORIGINAL REVIEW:EASE OF USEFairly easy for basic functions - taking a picture, reviewing pictures, setting resolution, deleting etc.Some of the more advanced feature can be buried in menus. Many of the icons and other indicators on the screen are not obvious and one must refer to the manual. On at least one occasion, I found an item on the camera menu that wasn't in the index of the manual.Despite what I listed above, I'd say this camera qualifies as easy to use.PICTURE QUALITY look great on my home ink jet printer at 4X6. From a foot away, you can't tell that it isn't a traditional print. (just less vibrant)AUTOFOCUS seems to work fine. Flash is more than adequate.LOW LIGHT shooting is pretty good but could be betterCOLOR ACCURACY is good but not perfect. I'm not sure if it is my printer or the camera, but traditional photos are distinctly more vibrant.RESOLUTION. It is advertised as 3.3 megapixels but I saw somewhere in the literature that is \"effectively\" 3.3 megapixels. By my calculation it is 3.15 but so what? I which they'd say it like it is, anyway.ZOOM is almost useless since it doesn't work at the highest resolution which is the resolution I use and almost never change. You'll just have to crop after you get the picture on the computer.SHUTTER DELAY and RESET TIME are tolerable and much better than some of the cameras I played with in the storeI've seen bigger SCREENS on other cameras but it does the job. It is a little dim in daylight forcing you to use the eyepiece. You can easily turn the screen off to save batteries -- a nice feature.The included BATTERY CHARGER is a nice touch and can be used for your other electronic items. However, it would have been classier for Sony to make the battery charger also work as AC adaptor like it does for video cameras. You can buy an adaptor for extra money, which isn't cool.BATTERY LIFE if more than enough to fill up the chip. Probably, you'll want to buy an extra pair for backup. Since it uses standard AA, you could also just keep a pair of alkaline or NiMH batteries on hand to use in a pinch.MEMORY STICK. I wish they would adopt a more common standard like the SD or MMC but other than that, it works just fine. I wish they also would include a bigger chip.  You will probably have to go out and buy one. I bought 128MB which hold 91 pictures at full resolution but added...to the price of the camera.The camera SIZE is like a small 35mm camera and is a little lighter than my Olympus 35mm Stylus.No CAMERA CASE is included, which is a drag.  I found one that fits perfectly ..., so that was easily solved.The little RUBBER COVER that covers the plugs is not well designed. It falls off all the time and finally I put some scotch tape on it to keep it in place. This would not be a satisfactory solution if you use the USB cable but I use a card reader so I don't open the cover much.VIDEO feature is fun but the picture quality is terrible. Still, it is fun to play with. You videos will make you look like one of those imbedded Iraqi reporters!  The sound is quite good. You can also add voice attachment to still photos a feature that would be better if you could easily switch to it. Also, it frustratingly clips off that last couple second of your message.The VOICE RECORDER (same as what I mention above) is a feature that is cool but not too useful since it is limited to about 45 seconds. Too bad. The camera could also serve as a cool voice recorder. It will work OK for short notes.VIDEO OUT is pretty useful for reviewing your pictures if you are not near a computer (like on vacation.)Included SOFTWARE is barely adequate. I found the ImageMixer software very frustrating until I finally got the learning curve going up. The help screens are not helpful. Still, it's free and works (sort of!)  Probably, you'll want to buy another software package. Fortunately both the pictures and MPEG videos are open-formats and easily import into most programs.", "Date": "August 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "An awesome camera", "Author": "nepalisherpa \"dotcomshopper\"", "ReviewID": "R25V1WGFS6HT5W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about two weeks ago and it's a perfect little camera.  The size is just perfect, but, just because it's small does not mean it's a basic camera.  This camera falls under point-and-shoot category, but, it also offers you a lot of manual controls such as exposure control, white balance control, focus control, ISO control, etc.  It also has preset scene modes such has night, snow, beach, landscape, portrait night, etc.  For picture taking, you can have a combination of different megapixel (3.1, 2.8 @ 3:2, 2.0, 1.2, and VGA) and compression (Fine or Standard).  Picture quality is AWESOME.  Outdoor pictures are just perfect and indoor pictures are between best and good (if there is any such thing).  Buttons are very easy to operate.  Video mode is another thing to brag about.  You can take videos at 640*480 or 160*? resolution.  The 160*? is not good at all.  But 640*480 is just awesome.  Video size is only limited by the amount of memory you have.  I can record upto 5 minutes on my 128MB card.  The only thing I hate about this camera is the cover that hides the video-out, usb, and dc-in port.  Another thing that could would have made this a better camera is the wait between shots when using fill-flash or flash.  It takes about 3-4 seconds before the camera can take another shot.  However, when taking pictures without flash, it's as fast as any film-cameras.", "Date": "April 5, 2003"}, {"Title": "Very good Camera.", "Author": "Asian Cat", "ReviewID": "R2GVJGZTEABR4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am one more happy owner of Sony DSC P32. The camera has been with me for almost a month now and it's been used a lot. Let me update my review. My purpose for this camera is an all-around sort of thing: It must be pocketable so I can carry it to school, to work, to my family's garden, to my friends' outing, to the mall... well, you get the idea.Henceforth, here are the features I found most useful:  Amazing picture quality, clear and vibrant.  Easy to use and small enough to fit in my pocket.  Real time shutter and aperture info.  Rechargeable AA NiMH batteries.  Finger grip on body front.  Instant detection and download with WinXP.  Separate power ON button. Because it does, the lens cover remains closed when you only want to preview your pictures or change setup settings! Just turn dial to \"play\" or \"setup\" position before turning ON the camera.  No optical zoom. The less moving parts, the better.  And last but not least, it's beautiful.Wish list:  LCD could be made larger.  An ISO 50 would be a nice addition.  More accurate white balance in auto mode.For me the Sony DSC-P32 is a good-looking, functional design. I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone who wants a highly portable and reliable digital camera that can be carried on your pocket ready to shoot at a moment's notice. I can only smile in reaction to contrary recommendations by professionals. As far as this actual user is concerned, the Sony DSC-P32 is beautiful to look at and a pleasure to use!Good luck hunting for your own camera!", "Date": "October 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "My First Digital Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3SSRU9UNZDTSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for about a month and have to say I am very happy with the picture quality and ease of use.  I debated on purchasing the model with the optical zoom, but for my type of camera usage (vacations, pictures of the kids, animals, flowers, etc.) the P32 digital zoom is more than satisfactory.I also purchased two 128MB Lexar Memory Sticks and the Lexar Memory Stick Reader.  I would highly recommend the reader, it will save your camera batteries for taking pictures instead of powering the camera for uploads.  The Lexar sticks haven't given me a moment of trouble, either, and are extremely well priced compared to the Sony sticks.I also purchased some Rayovac NiMH batteries (half the price of Sony's) which charged just fine in the battery charger included with the camera.If you have ever used one of those \"mail the camera\" jobs then you're familiar with the wait time while the flash charges.  You will have a much shorter wait with this camera, but there is definitely a pause while the flash recharges.  I did not notice any wait time while taking pictures without the flash - the save to the memory stick is quick!The LCD display is very easy to read once you become familiar with all the tiny icons.  I did have difficulty seeing the display in bright outdoor light until I discovered the settings to darken/lighten the display:)  In the meantime I used the normal \"nose to the camera\" image viewer.The camera has an automatic lens cover that closes when the camera is powered off.  This might be true of all digicams, I'm just relieved to have one less item to track!My only complaint is the manual.  There isn't any \"flow\" to it and sections I felt should be grouped together are scattered through the booklet.  The animated GIF, multi-burst, and MPEG settings are in the same location on the camera, but not in the manual!  I ended up creating and printing a cheat sheet to carry in my camera bag.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a first-time digital camera.  I absolutely love the instant gratification of taking a bunch of pictures and seeing them in all their glory on the computer immediately afterwards.  Waiting for film to be developed, only to discover I under/overexposed the picture, is now a thing of the past!", "Date": "August 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the price", "Author": "Chris Chun", "ReviewID": "RBWRHIBPN591R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great quality camera.  It comes with all the accessories like rechargable batteries... etc. you need.  The only thing you need is an additional 128mb memory stick... the only thing that's not so good about the camera is that there's no optical zoom.  But since it has the smart digital zoom feature, it's not all that bad.  You just have to edit the picture later for a close up... all in all, it's very easy to use and an awesome camera for the price... and I actually like the look of it...unlike some other comments I read before buying it.

We took over a hundred pictures this weekend at a family event and cannot believe the quality of the pictures. They are so crisp and clear, almost better than in person. We have been searching for a great camera at a good price and we found it with this one. We highly recommed this camera and know you will be happy with your purchase. We do recommend a larger memory stick maybe 64mb or 128mb.

I would have easily paid 5 times the price for all of the wonderful (and easy to use) features.  Don't believe me?  I already shelled out [money] for a Coolpix 990 2 years ago with the birth of our daughter, then [more money] for a digital camcorder 6 months later.  Why did I need another camera you ask?  While there is no denying that the coolpix takes incredible pictures, it's too bulky and complicated.  It has TOO many options and worst of all, you can only shoot 30 seconds of video WITHOUT SOUND! What's the point?!?  (My husband got me this camera!).  The digital camcorder obviously would do the trick but it's so bulky and it's never around when I want to capture those adorable moments of a 2 year old.  Being a parent of a toddler, I wanted a camera that I could carry with me EVERYWHERE and be able to take great pictures and VIDEO CLIPS with AUDIO!  I love the fact that you can take minutes, not mere seconds of video.  And best of all, it is the easiest camera to operate in the world!  I didn't even have to read the manual.  Just shoot, and plug it into your computer (I do have XP). Finally, a product that I have been looking for!  Do not hesitate in getting buying this camera.

The functions are easily accessed through the menu and the battery charger that's included has got to be worth more than the savings.I highly reccomend this camera for anyone looking to get into digital photography.

I've been using my trusty Fuji Finepix 2400 Zoom for the past 2 years, and have been very satisfied with the images it's made. But at 2 MP I've outgrown it a little. Now I've always been a fan of Sony products, but in their digital camera arena, their prices are a bit high. Then along came the Cybershot DSCP32. It had great reviews from all the major sites, ie pcphotoreview.com, steves-digicams.com, Amazon.com etc and everyone seemed to like it. However the dealbreaker is you can get it for under $200.  I won't review all the specs, I think everyone here has already covered it, but lets just say that if your giving this as a gift to a first time digital user, they will love you, because everythng you need is included. No one else can say that. Camera, \"film\", batteries, and a charger!  Being a lifelong sceptic, I try to see how good things are right out of the box. Judging such things as ease of use, features, and can I even just take a darn photo just by raising it up and snapping the shutter.  Yes you can.... I did just that, after setting the date and time, put the memorystick in my card reader and opening the image in Photoshop. My goodness..the colors were rich, no obvious pixilation,  and I could even 'clearly' see what was on the television that the camera was partially aimed at.

It's pretty easy to figure out, even without the instruction manual, and the computer software is straight forward too -especially for Windows XP users.It has a video mode which is fun to play around with (the picture isnt terribly good, but the sound is)and it comes with a Video Out so that you can hook it straight up to your tv 9this drains the batteries quicker though).

It's unable to zoom in on objects while in it's 3.2mp mode (which is the highest quality you can get on this camera), so I was unable to take detailed close up pictures.Perhaps the LCD screen would be better a bit bigger and it could do with having a more accurate white balance, but for simple, around-the-house photos, you cant get much better than this (at least, not for this low price range).", "Date": "May 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera for the price", "Author": "Thomas Jankowski \"Amber\"", "ReviewID": "R27X9PVBEGLDAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just recently got this camera on Christmas.  I decided on this one rather than a Vivitar one, and I feel it was a good choice.  I opened it and started to read the manual, and I put it down after about two minutes.  It makes no sense and if anything made the camera harder for me to understand.  Without the manual it was real easy to understand.  I figured it all out within two days.I use the 64mb sony memory stick.  It only gives you a 16 so you have to purchace a bigger one seperatly.  It works great and fits about 50 pictures, or about 3 minutes of video.  I use the kodak 6 in one memory reader.  I just pop the stick in that and something pops up and It only takes about 2 minutes to put my pictures on the computer.  It'd reccomend a memory stick reader for anyone getting any digital camera. I got the 6 in one, because down the line I might get a new camera, and that way I don't have to buy a new one.Another thing I really enjoyed was the video feature.  Most other cameras let you record like 60 seconds max of video or something.  This camera lets you film as much as you can until the memory stick is filled.  The lighting of it gets dark once you put it on a computer, but it's not a camcorder, it's a camera.  You can't really expect the best ;).The only real drawbacks of this camera is no zoom.  You have to be ok with getting real close to what you want to take a picture of.  It can get pretty frustrating.  I only use it for pictures of friends, animals, etc...So it's not that big of a deal most of the time.  If you need a zoom, do not get this camera.  Also, there is a little wait between taking pictures with the flash on.  It's not that long, but sometimes I go to take another picture and then, grr I have to wait.All in all, the camera is pretty good for 200 bucks (what I got it for).  The pictures are clear, plus it's small and easy to use.  I defiently got what I paid for, in my opinion.

The film is expensive and developing is worse.  We take a TON of pix of my daughter - we're lame like that - so it's ripping a hole in my wallet - especially since my wife will take several pix of the same outfit/situation, etc.  Fast forward to xmas - we got this camera.  I love it.  I haven't shown my wife how to use it yet, but I've picked up how to use it pretty quickly.  I occasionally refer back to the manual to review specifics, but overall, I like it.  We bought the Lexar 128mb memory stick because at 3.1mp, you can only take 10pix before you're spent.  With the 128MB you're up to 82 pix (or if you shoot at the 1.1mp quality - 202 pix).  The software to connect the camera to the laptop was super easy to install.  I still have to learn how to navigate it a bit more, but that will come with time.  The only pain is that you have to work to get to the pix later on.  What I mean is this: I click on \"my documents\" then on \"image transfer\" then you have to click open another 3 folders to finally get to your shots.  There might be a better way, but I haven't had the time to figure it out.The zoom is nonexistent for the 3.1mp and the 2.8mp quality pix.  And then with the lower quality pix there is zoom, but it doesn't zoom very far in.  Regardless, after you take a picture you can zoom in VERY close and crop out the rest while the picture is still on the camera.  It'll save as a new picture, so you'll still have the original shot, and now this new edited version.Anyway, I like it, it was a present from my father-in-law so I don't know how much he paid for it, but it does what I want it to do.

It has an amazing amount of features and virtually any aspect of your picture taking can be controlled. Some cons to take into considerance: It goes through batteries pretty quickly, so if you are planning to take a lot of pictures, especially with flash, then you might want to take some extras. The included rechargables last longer than normal ones, however. Also, if you want zoom, you might want to consider then DSC-P72 or DSC-P92, since the 3x digital zoom only only applies if you use the lowest resolution for the picture.

And by the way, it's the second digital camera of any kind I've bought.  I hope that this indicates what I'm trying to convey: I was very happy with my first camera.  Had I known I was going to spend over $400 for (2) digital cameras in the course of 6 months, I would have bought a more feature-laden model, no doubt.  But this model was functional enough to get me to shell out another $200 for the same model.It is compact (small...) and easy to carry around in a pocket if you are going to a party or some event where you don't want a big ol' thing dragging you down, this may be the camera for you.  The zoom is not excellent, but it is usually quite adequate.  My problems before were when I was trying to get pictures of friends across the street.  I used the digital zoom, and the pictures did not turn out that well, because I was using a less than \"high\" image size.  In a room, or fairly \"close up\", the zoom works great.The price has fallen since my first purchase of one of these cameras.  My guess is that this model is close to being discontinued (see Consumer Reports, November 2003, p 15, \"Shop Smart\"--\"Cameras typically remian on the market about a year.  If you see the price on a particular model being to plummet, it's usually a sign tht the camera will soon be discontinued.\")  I paid $199 today, October 4, 2003, (at a local Best Buy) but I paid $239 about 5 months ago for the one I lost.  Discontinued shouldn't scare you; Sony's gonna be around, and there are deals to be had.If you're looking for a feature-filled camera, there are better cameras than this.  If you're looking for an excellent, simple, well-thought-out camera, the DSCP32 is one you should at least consider.  The price is definitely right at $199.  It comes with rechargable AA batteries, the charger, a USB cable, and a cable you can hook up to your TV to watch a \"slide show\" of the pictures you've taken.  My one complaint, it *doesn't* come with a DC adapter, so you're relying on those rechargable batteries all the time.  The Sony Software is not that great, but it comes with the camera.  If you have one of the finer imaging software programs, you should do fine, and the Sony software is ok.  It may be the worst part of the package with this great little camera.If you should buy this model, my advice:  DON'T LOSE IT!", "Date": "October 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Little Camera!", "Author": "Rachel R Adams", "ReviewID": "R30VVESPYXG9YC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm pleased with my recent purchase of this camera, and am captivated by it's movie-capture ability!

If I didn't have the Nikon 2100 then I would have to say this camera is good, in comparison with my old Olympus and Canon cameras. In case you are wondering why I have so many cameras, well I like electronics and trying out different ones, sort of like people who like to drive new cars once in a while. Anyways, this camera is not very well designed physically, and that is my biggest problem with it. While all the specs say the thickness is 32.6mm, when it came there was an errata sheet that said that was wrong, and it actually is 35.2mm.  This makes the camera bulky and heavy, which don't feels comfortable at all in the pocket. Now I have the Nikon 2100 also, and it contains a 3x optical zoom lens which the Sony does not have, yet it is smaller and feels much better in the hand during shooting as well as in my pocket. What is more is that the Nikon is around the same price as the Sony. As far as versatility goes, this camera has very good video capabilities, although the video at 640*480 is noticeably choppy. Picture quality is good compared to low end Canon and Olympus, but overall it is not as sharp, accurate, and bright as my Nikon. I still think Nikon lens are the best there is. Other than these gripes, this camera is a decent value, due to its high megapixel count and inclusion of a battery charger. However in my opinion 2 MP is good enough, and sometimes a good 2MP camera can have better picture quality than a not so good 3MP camera, which fits the comparison of the Nikon2100 with the Sony P32. Sony could have easily made this camera much smaller since it has no big zoom lens, but I guess they don't want to eat into their smaller P2-P10 series cameras.

There were plenty of features and color options that made taking pictures fun.  Video quality was horrific!  If you weren't outside in full sunlight you couldn't take decent footage.  But I didn't need the video camera anyway, so that was fine with me.  There is a thing on the front that allows you to rest a finger on the camera while you are shooting, allowing for one-handed shots easily (which was great when I was holding a child while taking pictures).  Navigation was simple- I'm not knowledgeable about cameras but I made my way around it just fine.My Sony met its death when my stupid water bottle leaked (Deer Park has started making shoddy lids on their sport bottles- I can't tell you how many times my water has spilled in the past few months).  It wasn't able to recover from a semi-submersion (it was only wet for a few seconds and I dried it off immediately, removing and drying the batteries and memory stick and letting it sit out to dry for days) and now when I turn it on I just get a blue screen that I cannot navigate away from.

I can still view pictures on the memory stick, but that's about it. Customer support could not explain it, so they said to send it in for servicing. Since I've had it past 90 days, I will have to pay for the labor estimated at $139. If it is deemed a non-warranty problem, then I will need to pay much more. Well, I may as well buy a brand new camera. So, unfortunately, this camera was a costly \"disposable.\" Not sure I would buy this camera again.", "Date": "May 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "nice package", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2FT01IMIZZ86U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just bought this camera today, and lemme tell u, its wonderful. the size is nicely shaped, because it feels really sturdy, compared to other cameras that are small, yet fragile. as for the picture quality, its pretty crisp. in order to get a better picture u should get a tripod, because the picture tend to be a little bit blurry when taken by hand. the functions on the camera are pretty self explanitory and are well in reach of ur fingers. the only complaints i would have would be that you cant optically zoom with it. you ahve to take the picture first, then u can look at it afterwords and zoom in. but the pictures dont get very blurry when u zoom in, which is a good thing. also, the lil cover for the plugs n stuff on the camera is made of rubber or sumthin. which seems a little awkward, becuase u would expect more from sony. and its kinda hard putting it back on the camera. another thing would be the position of ur left hand on the camera. theres not a whoel lot of space to put your left hand because the lens is built in that area. all in all i would say this is a great camera especially for its price, and the brand name, sony. if you are looking for the best camera ..., then i would recomend this.", "Date": "August 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Erases pictures off the memory stick!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RG0Q5MKLYME5R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this as a gift.  It is missing any type of zoom at the 3.2 level.  I have several sizes and brands of memory sticks and it will erase my pictures.  I took pictures at Xmass.  I was about to leave and decided to take one more group shot and bamm. the camera when crazy and sure enough for the 3rd time in 4 months it erased all the pictures on that memore stick.  This camera almost went through the window but it was not my house!!  I will toss this thing in the garbage and I will pick up anything non-sony!!  Sony support was not helpfull and they made me go past my 90 day return so the store would not take it back. This camera lost important pictures of Xmass and my first born child and a trip to visit a great grandma who may not be around anymore.  If you want the camera.. I will give it to you for free!!!", "Date": "December 28, 2003"}, {"Title": "Una Buena Camara , Un Buen Precio", "Author": "Rafael Fu", "ReviewID": "R2MURVL7RE7QP1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Me parece que la camara tiene buena resolucion , buen tama\u00f1o pero el zoom le hace falta, yo tengo una stick de 256mb y tomo fotos espectaculares , bueno se las recomiendo!", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy a SONY Product!!!!", "Author": "Willis R.

I bought this particular camera for my children at Christmas. After one week it would not power on. I sent it for reapirs and the repair estimate was $725.50!! I of course confirmed this with a phone call and that was the correct price. It would cost me $25.00 plus shipping just to have the camera returned to seek out a local service technician. Apparently Sony products are disposable. If they break just toss them away and buy a new one.At first I thought it was a joke. Who could even be serious about that ridiculous price?

A week later after I received it for my birthday I told her to return it because I didnt know about their return policy And did not want to get burned  down the road.  When she went into return it they said sorry its a 15% restocking fee and just would not give in at all even though the sale guy said we could return it. I guess he was right we could return it but he forgot to mention the small detail of the RESTOCKING FEE. So we decided to just keep it thank-you very much(not). Now 4 months later the LCD screen does not have a picture and now I'm being told, to bad its out of our 90 day return policy. So now here is my advice. Find out for yourself in writing what the return policy is so you don't get burned like I did. And buy your product somewhere else because they stick in these young salesmen that only want to make a sale. And tell you what you want to hear just to make a sale.", "Date": "June 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "GOOD GADGET", "Author": "G. K.
