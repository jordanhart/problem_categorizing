This unit feels VERY solidly built and performs great.  The night vision is clear and bright at greater than 20 feet.  The picture is sharp and accurate (though I lose a lot of quality going through my Q-See MPEG capture card).  The wide field of vision is excellent (there is a bit of 'fish-eye', but I don't know how you'd avoid that with a nearly 90 degree range).  These do not look ridiculous or obvious mounted to my home.  One camera covers about 80% of my backyard and another mounted above my front door monitors guests, delivery personnel, solicitors, and occasionally nocturnal predators (lots of geckos in Florida.)  I highly recommend this camera, particularly for domestic applications where appearance might be a concern.  BEAR IN MIND; this unit did NOT include power or cabling.  If you are planning more than one camera I strongly recommend purchasing an AC adapter intended for 4 or 8 units, vs getting a module for each device.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!", "Author": "R.

I had been searching for a dome camera and this one had everything I could ask for. Great picture quality and the night vision is amazingly clear. I was skeptical at buying two at first but I am glad I did! This camera is a must buy!! The camera has great durability and it is sturdy. The camera is also very nice for domestic areas because they don't look very obvious mounted on buildings outside.

I bought two of these to replace older black and white cameras that got damaged in a thunderstorm.  The performance in total darkness is excellent.  However, to get good color, the scene must be brightly lit, otherwise the IR diodes stay \"on\" and the colors are washed out.  There is also a tendency to white compression on both of my samples under certain lighting conditions, this is why I gave this product only 4 stars. However this camera is adequate as a fixed security camera.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Incorrect color, poor build quality.", "Author": "S. Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1AEQ1BP944XCB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this to add to my CCTV setup. The camera's color was inaccurate. Blacks were blue and people's faces/eyes in daytime were pitch black. Adjusting color on the DVR could not even out the issues and the camera seemed to pick out and misrepresent certain colors. There was no option for exchange only a return. Unfortunately with most things from the land of the egg roll, you don't really know what you are buying till you get it first hand. Who knows if this is a genuine Effio chip either. Better off with CNB, Bosch, Dahua, or Pelco. More money but you get quality and a camera that works right, right out of the box.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Fair Critique...", "Author": "J. Wons", "ReviewID": "R102MF1ADTU50N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're new to security cameras and are setting up something for your house for the first time, I think these are a fair value.Here's the problems I had with the unit:1.  Mine did not include the power supply, even though the title (as of Oct 8 2011) indicates it comes with a power supply.  Not really a big deal since amazon will take it back and send a new one.2.  I don't believe the image quality is 600 lines.  I have a 500 line camera and the resolution is much cleaner than this one.  I have no idea how to prove this.  But an observation nonetheless (and there are too many factors that go into image quality, so I might be wrong on this).3.  This bothered me, but might not bother you; the LED's glow red, and it's a definite, noticeable red at night.  My other security camera made by a different manufacturer have LEDs and they do not glow red (see my comment below - they do glow a little).  From what I read, glowing red LED's are slightly older technology and are inexpensive (hence why they use them).But trying the camera is risk free as Amazon will take the product back if you don't like it.  It was worth a shot and you might like it and think I'm being too picky given the price of this camera.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "Reviewer76", "ReviewID": "R22JMKDB86DQT3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After purchasing two of the 420TVL version of this camera, I thought getting this one (listed at 700TVL) would be a great step up in quality and clarity.  This was not the case.  Under certain lighting conditions, there was a very slight improvement in picture quality, but in others the image was actually more blurry.  The night vision was about the same, except when in the direct path of the IR.  Because this camera has 8 more LEDs than the 420 version, anything that passes directly in the center of the picture is completely unrecognizable; it's a pure white blur.  This camera is also considerably larger physically, making it much more noticable when mounted on the house.  Having spent an extra $50 over the 420, this camera was a total dissapointment and not worth the money.  I have reinstalled the 420, and have not yet found an application for this camera.  Just like the 420, neither the camera nor the power supply for the 700 are UL listed.  I would not recommend this camera since you can buy a better functioning camera for less than half the price.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "VideoSecu Security Camera", "Author": "L. mccarty \"Mac\"", "ReviewID": "R1TMD65KMQL1K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pretty good camera.

I don't think they'll be able to get this one so easily. It mounts flush to the side of my house, no bracket sticking out to hang on and pull down. It's not vandal proof but much better than a normal camera. It's a lot less noticeable than a standard mounted camera. The quality is mid-range. Its a little grainy, but better than a 420 TV Line camera. The night vision is very good in my opinion for this price range. The wide angle view is helpful. Installation was easy, but make sure you don't tighten the locking ring until you're sure the camera is pointing where you want it.
