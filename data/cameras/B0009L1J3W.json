{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simple and effective", "Author": "Bertilak", "ReviewID": "R1B7S3DWFNQHD8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "See UPDATE2 at bottom.Just installed one of these. No problems and works fine with my Samsung 46-inch LCD.Instructions are clear and complete. They are generic instructions for a variety of televisions but include an 18-page list of TV models indicating exactly which of the bolts, spacers, washers, etc. are to be used with each model. Each variety and size of this miscellaneous hardware comes individually packaged and labeled to match the instructions.The general idea is to attach the wall plate to the wall; attach the brackets to the TV; then hang the TV (via the brackets) on the wall plate.A few installation hints:1) It is a two-person job so plan on having some help. A second person is a big help when lining up the wall-plate to be sure you drill the holes so that the TV ends up level and in the position you want. And, chances are your TV is too heavy or bulky to be moved safely by one person anyway.2) You will want to read and re-read the instructions before you start.3) Once you have a feel for the instructions use a yellow highlighter to mark information specific to your situation and to mark the packaging for the bolts, etc. you need.4) Use of a small mirror and flashlight can help you direct the long allen wrench to the bolts that lock the brackets to the wall plate. Holding the flashlight is another place where a second pair of hands can help.5) Do not adjust nor lock-in the tilt until after you have connected the wires to the back of the TV. Better yet, attach them before hanging the TV onto the wall plate.UPDATE:I read in another review that you should have a level and a stud finder. I probably should have mentioned that in my hints above but didn't think to since I already had those things. So, I agree, you will want to use those to do the job correctly. For the stud finder, get a reasonably good one as the cheap ones are not much better than tapping on the wall and listening for the best sounding spots. I have a Zircon 60369 Studsensor I65 Onestep Center Finding Stud Finder (which I bought at Lowe's). It says \"Center Finding\" but what I like is the way it also identifies the edges of studs. If I can get repeatable locations on both edges and the center then I believe I have found the stud! Zircon sells more expensive models so if you have difficult walls (e.g. plywood, or plaster with lath) you may want to consider those, but this model worked fine for my typical 5/8\" drywall over 2x4 studs, even with some plaster over the drywall.Another good tip I saw was to attach the brackets to the TV first thing. This will allow you to measure more carefully exactly where you want the wall plate. Come to think of it, this is exactly what I did, but for a different reason. I wanted to be sure the brackets would fit my TV before committing myself to drilling holes in the wall!UPDATE2 (18 Aug 2010):Got a second flat panel so got another one of these. It has slightly changed since my last purchase but is essentially the same -- which is a good thing. The reason for this update is to point out that the \"18-page list of TV models\" mentioned above is no longer included in the package -- which is NOT a good thing.The instructions send you to a web page, but all that does is tell you which mount to buy for a particular TV model and not which mounting hardware to use. But you already know which mount to buy or you wouldn't be reading the instructions! I resorted to calling the 800 number to find out which hardware to use. I suppose I could have done some trial-and-error but I asked since I'd rather not risk messing up mismatched threads. So I knocked off a star based on decreased ease of installation.P.S. Their web page didn't even recognize my TV (Panasonic TC-P50G25) which is neither a particularly new nor obscure model.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "One touch tilt???", "Author": "K.

Both of the brackets have adjustments on them and consequently they must both be adjusted in order to tilt the TV up or down.  Not a bad TV mount, but it is not what I ordered.  Be careful when purchasing a flat-panel TV mount.  Do some research and visit the manufacurers website before choosing which model you want.  After you choose the model that fits your application, go back and find it on Amazon.  Do not rely on the product descriptions listed on Amazon because I have found several of them to be inaccurate.

THAT WAS GREAT !!Can be installed on 2 or 3 studs (32 inch appart)The instructions are clear and easy to follow. All you need is someones help to hang up the TV. Mine is a 50'MAXENT HD PLASMA,125 pounds.Before I installed it I tested the wall mount by hanging myself on it(165pounds),I mounted it on 2 studs with the 4 lag bolts provided and I was a little sceptical,but it passed my test and with the help of my wife Naomi,we hung up the TV and we love how it looks.Also if you have it mounted higher on the wall, the tilt feature is very handy and the mount comes with a long \"L\" shaped wrench to access behind the TV for tilt adjustments.Before I tried more expensive wall mounts but this one has the same or better quality and definetly better design and features.

The locking screws that secure the TV arm brackets to the mounting plate add an extra level of security.However, it's a real shame the wall bracket isn't just a couple of inches wider, so it would span 3 studs (on 16\" centers).  I should have read reviewer G. Knight's comments about this, before ordering.I should have checked my stud locations before ordering this mount.  I discovered that the centerline of my optimal TV location on my wall, was almost directly over a stud.  So, I had to shift the mount left to the farthest recommended holes.  After mounting the TV on the bracket and shifting it to the right to compensate, the wall bracket flexes by an undesireable amount.If you are going to mount a 50\" or larger TV on your wall, and want a precise placement, I recommend that you avoid this model and go with the ST670 series instead.On the other hand, if you have a wide latitude for positioning your TV on the wall, or are lucky enough so that your TV's centerline lies directly between two studs (plus or minus 2\"), this mount will do the job very nicely.  My advice is, determine where you want your TV then check to see if your stud locations are optimally placed, before ordering.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Easy to install", "Author": "Jason Lee \"JPL\"", "ReviewID": "R3EQU9S3IJGVU9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Installed easily.

I didn't like the idea of dangling my $3000 investment on the wall.  But after searching (with no luck) for a TV stand I decided to hit the web and do some research to find a Wall Mount.  And I'm glad I did.  My Sharp Aquos 52\" weighs in at about 85 pounds.  I wanted something that would hit at least two studs and this mount fit the bill.Installation was easy and the instructions were pretty straight forward.  Once I found the center of the studs I used my laser level to make sure this baby was level.  I drilled the pilot holes for the top two screws and then secured the mount to the wall (but not all the way right).  I then drilled the pilot holes for the bottom two screws.The kit comes with plenty of screws for a variety of different TVs.  The included installation instructions tells you what screws to use with your TV.  Check out Peerless' website ([...]) to see if your TV is compatible with the mount.All in all... This thing is awesome.

This was a little overwhelming upon opening the box, but a quick review of the instructions calmed my nerves a bit when I realized I would only need one set of bolts/screws.The printed instructions were clear and thorough.  With a little care and attention to details (okay, so maybe a lot of torque, too, to get the bolts into the studs) I got the mount up on the wall, flat and level.  The brackets attached to my 42 inch Panasonic plasma in a flash.  With a little help from the other half, we hung the TV on the mount and marveled at how the mount didn't even budge under the weight of the TV.The tilt function isn't one touch by any means, but it is simple and very secure.  You need to loosed two 'screws' on the brackets using a very long allen key (included), loosen two more screws by hand and then tilt the TV to your desirec position.  Then you repeat the process with the screws to tighten.  Simple enough.Overall, I am very pleased with the product and the results.  If you are questioning your ability to undertake this job yourself, this mount should give you the confidence to get that TV up on the wall.", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "M. Braceros", "ReviewID": "R2VYB8LOA5SAMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this product in a timely manner. Beautiful black color matched my Samsung 50\" plasma (97 pounds). We set this up on metal studs with 24\" space between them (i live in a loft that was converted from an old shoe factory.). From measurement to drilling, to putting the mount on the wall, and hanging on it (my friend who helped was 150lbs, and he was doing pull ups on it), to using the provided screws to put the brackets on the tv, took about 45 minutes. The end product looked great!PROS:One of the things I really thought was great was that the mount came with screws and a sheet that tells you which ones to use for your tv. This made the whole process easier and more efficient.Also, since the mount plate is so wide, and has many holes, you can use it for studs with spacing that ranges from 12\" to 24\", something that not a lot of other mounts can do.CONS:Buy your own bolts for putting plate on the wall. Shouldn't be too expensive, maybe 10 bucks more at the hardware store, for 4-6 molly bolts or even cabinet anchors (if you are going to be installing on metal studs).CONCLUSION:For the price this was an awesome deal. Best buy was offering to do the installation for 300. We bought some screws and ended up doing it ourselves for free. Easy to do. Just gotta have the right tools (drill, measuring tape, level).", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "no frills, but gets the job done.", "Author": "bodum", "ReviewID": "R1I0DL2STKKQZZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this mount with the Samsung FP-T5084 plasma television, which came as a package deal from Amazon.  Taking it out of the package, it doesn't really appear sturdy enough to hold a 120 pound TV, but once I got it up on the wall, it works just fine.  One thing to note (as other reviewers have noted) is that it ships in black and not as shown here- not a problem for me as it matched my television, but I never saw a color selection option when ordering.Everything needed to complete the installation is included, and it's just a simple matter of matching your TV with the appropriate mounting hardware.  The installation took two people and it took us approximately an hour to get everything up and functional, but only because we got it set up the first time and then chose to move it down a little lower on the wall.  The only tools needed are a phillips-head screwdriver and a good drill to get the lags (provided) into your studs.I'd recommend if you're looking for a good, inexpensive wall mount that includes the tilt function.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wrong item description", "Author": "Y.

However, I would only recommend using this mount for such a large/heavy (approx 145 lb) TV based on the location & quantity of wall studs you are able to mount to.  If you happen to have the Panny 58\" 700U, I strongly recommend you check to see if you have at least 2 wall studs that will be centered (or close to center) behind the TV. I could only mount to 2 studs and they were off center by close to 4\".  The directions allow the mount to be up to 4\" off center, so I decided to keep the mount.  However, once I mounted the TV, the wall mount (on the \"weak side\") pulled away from the wall slightly.  I'm confident it will hold the TV but, if I had to do it again, I'd purchase a mount that uses slightly heavier gauge material (I believe Peerless does have a stronger mount available).

I thought I had it, but ended up 4 1/4 inches to high becasue the TV instructions said one thing and the Wall mount said another.  Mount comes with several different mounting screws and spacers. I had to call the support line to determine the right ones because the instructions didn't identify my SONY model.  That didn't work out to good either, becasue the ones the support person told me to use were the wrong ones.  The material package that came with the unit was short one of the screws I needed.

I'm so glad my wife insisted that we wall mount our new TV.  This wall mount is awesome.Construction: it' s constructed from thick metal that seems very strong to me.  It seems to be well designed and assembled.Installation: installing it wasn't that hard.  If you're handy with tools, you shouldn't have a problem.  The hardest part was figuring out which provided screws, spacers and/or washers were needed for my particular TV.  The provided list of TV's didn't have my TV listed so I chose a very similar Samsung model at the same size from the list and my selections worked.  Use a good stud finder and double check your findings.  Be sure to have a powerful drill with the proper drill bit and hex socket, or a socket wrench.  It took some serious torque to get the nice, large provided screws into the studs in my wall.  My drill wouldn't  do the trick so I used my socket wrench.  The back plate is mounted SOLID and is not going to go anywhere.  Mounting the rails onto the back of the TV was easy.  Make sure you don't get the right and left rails backwards.  Once you have the back plate on the wall and the rails on the TV, have someone help you lift the TV and put it on the back plate.  Then tighten the lower screws to keep it the TV firmly in place.Usage: this is truly \"one touch\" for me. With the tilt adjustment finger-tight screws all the way loose, my TV doesn't budge and is balanced amazingly, but I lightly tighten one or both of the finger-tight screws to keep it from moving in case I bump it.  The extra screws that will lock the tilt angle are an extra bonus for me but totally uneeded. Also, the upward tilt angle is high enough that I can connect and disconnect the cables from the back with just a little neck strain.  Depending on where your connections are, you might want to connect the wires before puting it on the wall.  Also, I can slide my TV to the right and left about 3 inches each way for fine tuning the centering on the wall.  Depending on the distance between the mounting locations on the back of the TV, you may have more or less side to side slide room.Final thoughts: great product, does its job simply and effectively.  I also realized that my TV is quite secure on the wall.

I ordered this Peerless ST660 tilting wall mount on Tuesday morning, received free shipping, and it was on my door steps on Wednesday evening.  Amazing shipping!A little background about myself, I am a degreed mechanical engineer, so I look at the design of things a little more in detail than most people.  The design of this kit is very good, and very simple.  The quality of the kit is top notch.  All components are nicely painted black, no scratched up parts, and more attachment hardware than you would care to imagine.  The assembly directions are great and easy to understand.The horizontal wall mount was super easy to attach to the wall.  Simply find your centerline of your TV and determine where you want it on the wall, find your studs, drill four holes, and install the lag bolts.  Kit comes with four 2-1/2\" long lag bolts.  Great holding strength.The two vertical mounts that attach to the back of the TV were easy to install.  I had ONE ISSUE with this item.  Not a problem though.  The screws supplied for this TV were M6x20 and two of the threaded holes on the back of the TV were not deep enough for the 20mm long screws.  I had to take two of the screws and grind off 4mm from the length to make them fit correctly.  Easy enough for me to do.After the TV and TV mounts were hung on the wall mount, I had to adjust the vertical location of these about four times to get the TV perfectly level, but this is a given thing with anything hung on the wall.Regarding the one-touch tilting mechanism, it is not quite a one-touch system.  But then again, how often does a person adjust the angle of their TV????  Once it is set, there it is.  Still a good design.Overall, this is a high quality kit that is well designed and can more than handle it's task.  Total installation time for me was about 90 minutes, and I completed it all without any assistance whatsoever.  It took me a little longer to install simply because I am a perfectionist with this kind of stuff.

I should be reviewing the product you would get if you bought this, but I have no idea what product that might be.When I first bought this, I already owned an ST650 Peerless wall mount.  I liked it, but needed something rated for a heavier and larger TV. I bought this one, and what came in the box was EXACTLY THE SAME as what came in the other one for $25 less, except for the label on the backing plate.  I went to their website and found detailed technical drawings of both this model and the ST650. So I'm 100% sure there was no mistake. I got exactly what they were trying to sell me both times. To make matters worse, it was nothing like what is now pictured. I checked the Peerless mounts website now, and Amazon's listings continue to be consistent with what the company claims.The sheet metal should have been strong enough on the cheaper model to hold the rated weight, but why come up with a new model number and a higher price, only to sell the same thing?  It turned out to be worse than that.First of all, the backing plate is thin enough that it has a slight flex, so if you grab it with one hand on each side, you can give it a subtle twist. That won't affect its ability to hold a heavy TV, but if your beams are not near the outside edges of the backing plate, then your bolts won't be at the edges either. If it pulls away from the wall a fraction of an inch at one end, your TV won't come crashing down. But if it's a 60 inch TV, it won't appear level.You should be able to slide a TV to any part of the bracket once it's mounted. When I first mounted my TV, I could not figure out why it wasn't level. I took it down and checked the wall plate carefully. It was perfectly level. I checked the brackets that screw into the TV. Unlike other mounts, the oblong holes on this one make it possible for the height on each side to differ. But rechecking showed that I had gotten that part correct too.I eventually realized that it was perfectly level if I slid it to the extreme left of the mounting plate, but was way off if I slid it to the right. I took the TV down again and added about 10 more bolts, so virtually all of the wall plate was bolted to the underlying plywood behind the drywall. At that point, things were level.What bothered me far more than that was coming back here and seeing that the picture now looks nothing like the model I purchased. Some manufacturers claim that specs are subject to change without notice, but what's the difference between one mount and another aside from design?  The one that now has the SAME model number as mine has a backing plate that's barely more than a top and bottom strip. It lacked enough metal when I bought it, and now they are expecting you to rely on REVIEWS OF A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT to decide whether to buy the current inferior looking one.I'd recommend an AmazonBasics mount instead. They weight twice as much because they don't leave out the metal. They give you better mounting brackets, a wall plate with a built in level, a stud finder, pivoting bottom latches instead of awkward to reach set screws, and the ability to tilt the TV without awkward lock knobs on each side. I expected the AmazonBasics mount to be ... basic. But I was more than pleasantly surprised by it, and when I checked back on this model to compare specs, I was shocked at what the company did.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "good basic unit...", "Author": "G&P;", "ReviewID": "R3OEUOY6EPYF2X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We purchased this tilt wall mount for our Sony Bravia 52 inch tv.

I weigh over 225 lbs, so I don't think my 80 lb TV is going anywhere.I suggest manually measuring the position of the brackets on your TV and using that as a guide to positioning the other bracket that goes on the wall.  I was unable to get the bracket centered on my Sony KDL-55V5100 (the holes just don't line up right), and using the measuring method in the instructions put me more than 4\" too high.As for being one-touch tilt, that is a joke.  I was barely able to reach the \"tension adjusters\" and the only three tension setting I was able to achieve were a) firmly locked on place, b) no resistance whatsoever, and c) just enough resistance so the TV slowly returns to the fully tilted-down position.  My TV needs to be tilted forward all the way, so I am not to concerned about that feature not working.", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great hanger for the money!", "Author": "S. jaouen \"Beave\"", "ReviewID": "R1WY95JLNM6OG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looked for a long time on what I wanted to hang my 50in Samsung plasma and decided on this one.

While you are adjusting height it is easy to get the TV on and off the mount until you tighten the set screws. There are more than enough screw holes that are horizontally elongated to find a stud. Use your stud finder to get the 2 studs you select then center your unit. Hang your Tv on it and tighten down the top set screws as needed to secure and level the set. You are done. There are no complicated instructions and the kit comes with every screw and collet you will ever need.

Once the wall mount is installed with these wood bolts, it's there to stay. The bracket screws that come with this kit are plenty. The screws, spacers fit my HDTV'S and there was no problem putting the brackets to my tv's. There are \"TWO\" options on tilting your brackets. One is the tension lever, and the other is a set screw. Find the angle that works best for you, set the screw and your done. For me, I used the set screw. Once your HDTV is hung on the mount, just use the long allen wrench that is provided and tighten the security screws to the bottom half of the wall mount. This secures your HDTV securely to your wall mount. Believe me, nothing nor anyone will remove your HDTV. I've read the reviews on this product, and the people who gave this product a bad review because of the instructions either didn't read the instructions or didn't understand what it was saying.

Thus far I am happy with the way it is working, although it took me a while to get it the way I wanted it.  I got the frame mounted to the wall just fine and the arms mounted to the TV, and then I hit a snag.  The instructions never said anything about loosening the nuts holding the screws in the middle of the arm (just under the tightening ratchet).  I initially removed the bottom pinned rod from the arm to allow it to move, as it would not previously.  This only allowed the locking screw above the tightening ratchet to move between 2 of the 5 defined locking points.  I realized the problem and loosened the nuts in the middle after replacing the pinned rod, and the mount then moved as intended.  The long alan security wrench provided was a life-saver, as it is almost impossible to get your hand behind the TV once it is placed on the wall.  I used it to tighten the bottom security screw to the bottom of the frame.Be aware that if your TV has the majority of the ports on the back, if the TV has a flat back as mine does rather than a recessed back, you will probably not be able to get the full downward tilt out of the mount as the cables coming out of the rear inputs will be touching the wall.Other than the initial problem getting the tilt to work, this mount is performing as expected.  You also get just about every conceivable mounting screw you would need, which is nice.As a side note, the one-touch tilt feature does work if you use the tightening ratchet rather than the locking screw positions.  Just make sure you get them fairly tight before placing the TV on the wall, because your hand will likely be too big to fit behind it to tighten or loosen it once it is mounted on the wall.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great shop, highly recommend......terrific", "Author": "Ricardo J.

My wife and I were able to install the ST660 to the wall and mount the panel on the bracket without a hitch.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "as promised", "Author": "Rob Audio", "ReviewID": "R1DBTW3IA5PRWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very well made product.  I scrapped the included anchors and used my own.  The trickiest part of install was reaching behind very large TV (52\" Sharp) to tighten connectors.  Long thin arms would be helpful.  TV is mounted above fireplace mantel and looks great.  Tilt is a nice feature, makes for improved viewing.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Does the job well", "Author": "O. Gilley \"Golf Prof\"", "ReviewID": "R29VE2AI6Y485I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a well designed mount that does the job. It was easy to install and came with all the hardware needed. There is a sheet that lists all the TVs this mount will work with. Simply find your brand and model and the sheet directs you to the labeled packets of hardware needed for your TV. You may have to visit the Peerless website if your TV is too new to have made the list when the mount was produced. If you have any doubts about which mount you need, the Peerless website will direct you to the correct mounts for your TV.The one-touch tilt is a bit misleading. You have to loosen a wing nut on each side to adjust the tilt, but it isn't difficult if you have some help. Overall, I would recommend this mount and the price is very reasonable for what you get.Addendum: The hex head wrench used to lock the TV to the mount was too long to work in my case due to a shelf below the mount. I email customer service and was promtly sent (2 days) 2 shorter wrenches that got the job done. I was very impressed by their customer service.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Peerless Universal Tilt Wall Mount worked great", "Author": "Steve Wenrick", "ReviewID": "RUK17032O4V3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used this product to hang a 50\" plasama to the wall.

In my case, I have a Samsung 52\" LCD mounted to it, and I feel good knowing I am nowhere near the 200 pound weight limit.It is very low profile, which is one of the reasons you bought a flat screen.  Why use a mount that holds it farther out from the wall if you don't have to?It can be locked in five degree increments.  So, if you always leave your TV at a certain angle, you can lock it in place and it won't shift over time.  I have a much smaller LCD in the kitchen on a fully articulating mount, and I wish I could lock that one as it tends to sag forward over time and has to be readjusted.  Very annoying.There are large screws that have to be drilled into studs to install this.  If you have a strong hammer drill, this is a good chance to use it.  It cannot be installed without a good drill as the giant screws screw directly into the wall studs to keep all the weight securely mounted.  Use a good edge-finding stud scanner to find the center of the studs so that you know the screws are secure.After the mount is securely affixed to the wall, and the bracket is screwed into the back of the TV, it is a fairly simple matter to just hang the TV on the wall.  Just make sure you use two people for the last step so that you can maneuver the television in place without dropping it.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellant!", "Author": "Donald J.

Instead, the wall plate is 31\" wide, which won't work at all.  All of these Peerless mounts have the same instructions, and assume 16\" spacing between studs.
