I run Linux at home and I had convinced myself that digital photos can never be as good as \"real\" photos. My wife insisted, so I chose to get this one.I like this camera a lot. The user interface is a bit unweildy, but five minutes and I became a pro. It's not terribly complicated and even my two-year-old daughter is taking pictures! Downloading it is absolutely simple, even running Fedora Core 5 with KDE. Just plug in the USB cord and up pops a window with your images.Anyway, the camera comes, built-in, with just a tiny bit of memory. Be sure to get one or two GB of memory right away, so you can take as many pictures as you like.", "Date": "February 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fairly nice camera...a few minor complaints", "Author": "G. Kramer", "ReviewID": "RVDDC5JYI4HJ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera a few months and use it regularly.  I bought it after having purchased another Casio for my wife and wanting to upgrade from an older, much larger, digital camera.  The Exilim is very thin, easily fits in your pocket and the large LCD screen is clear and readable even without glasses.  The choice of photo modes is extensive and the picture quality had been high.Its not perfect though. Getting the battery and SD card out is a pain in the neck...there is no release button and you have to sort of pick at them or use a pencil to eject.  The battery life is tolerable, not great and the charger is a bulky, two-piece unit that could be greatly streamlined so that you didn't have to pack it.  The USB-cord is really annoying (one more think to carry, since it uses a proprietary connector rather than a standard \"firewire\" type nub.  Casio would do well to streamline all this stuff (my wife's camera has a much better power-interface and its is OLDER so it seems as if they moving in the wrong direction with these modifications).That said...it does take great photos and is easy to use.  If you don't travel a lot and leave the goodies at home it would be an excellent choice.  And you can't beat the price for the quality of the unit.", "Date": "March 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "good value for money", "Author": "Cynthia Nill", "ReviewID": "RM96W4RA43J3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is in excellent working order and has a good array of features.

Pro's:  It's small.  Cons:  The battery has a very, very short life.  After 10-12 pictures, I can't count on it being ready for the next round of photos.  Shutter lag is too long.  I know that's the number one gripe of all digital camera owners, but this one seems to be worse than any one that I've had.  Next Picture cycle time can also be really terrible.  If you're looking to capture the moment, chances are you'll be capturing the moment AFTER the moment.

Unfortunately most of these happen indoors and in low light where the camera produces significant noise. This is probably related to the small sensor size. Pictures are good in bright light. I was shocked to discover that there is no aperture priority, shutter priority or manual mode. Instead there are numerous `best shot' modes, abbreviated BS (!). These are designated landscape, children, backlight, eBay, etc. It is hard to know exactly how each mode makes exposure settings so anyone interested in manually controlling depth of field will not like this camera. In short, you can only point, shoot and hope for the best.Pros* Compact and stylish.* Big, bright LCD.* Low cost.* Has image stabilization, although a camera this small and light is hard to hold steady so there is probably no net benefit over a larger camera without stabilization.Cons* High noise at higher ISO in low light.* No shutter priority, aperture priority or manual mode.* Slow to write to SD card. Shutter will not release when taking a rapid sequence of shots - a problem when photographing children.* Relatively near subjects (children that come towards you, not just flowers or insects) can only be focused in macro mode. This requires going into the menus which is often too slow and inconvenient resulting in missed opportunities. A button on the body would have been much better.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Pam \"Pam89128\"", "ReviewID": "RR4J0GA4MAIB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great pocket sized camera.
