I've played with this setting and can take a picture of a ceiling fan at high speed while moving my hand back and forth and it comes out clean and clear. This is an excellent camera for a novice like myself or anyone who wishes to have a high quality piece of equipment to learn with. But with most digital cameras nowadays taking the picture with the camera is 75% of the process i'd recommend becoming comfortable with a digital photo software program (I prefer Adope Photoshop) yet paintpro and others are just fine. So my final thoughts on this camera are that I've owned it for almost a year, taken shots from the mountains of alaska to the reefs of maui and the keys (with the underwater case) to just random college parties and never had a major problem or a minor problem that was due to anything with the camera... mostly my own ignorance of the equipment. Either way i'm no professional yet i've been complemented by folks who have $1,500 plus set ups by just learning how to use the settings and playing with the software. This is a great piece of equipment for learners if you are willing to learn yet also a good simple point and shoot camera", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "GREAT CHOICE FOR A DIGITAL CAMERA", "Author": "Guy Dannehl", "ReviewID": "R1L2V3UW3L4RAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research and putting my hands on virtually all Digital Cameras in the $200-$400 range I settled on this one at around $250.  Best web site for research is imaging-resource.com.  There you can see real tests and photos from every camera currently on the market, not a bunch of dumb opinions from idiots who won't read manuals and can't figure out how to use the camera.  I found this camera easy to use, with a super, large and clear LCD screen.  I tried photos in all modes and noticed no blurry pictures.(check web site noted above for sample test pictures)  the menus were fairly easy to navigate and easy to see on the monitor. Here is what I like and don't like:Pro: 2.5\" LCD, easy to use, nice size and form, Good shots in all modes.  takes 2 AA batteries not 4 or a expensive LiIon that needs a charger....and battery life is greatCon: Small optical viewfinder... I had to have a optical viewfinder because no matter how bright the screen is you will find a time that you cannot see the picture on it.Memory Stick.

It's been a really great camera.So I thought that it might be time to get another, with my kids hogging this camera so much.That was when I discovered that Sony seems to have stopped making this, the latest version of their line of point and shoot digicams that still use AA batteries.All of the new DSC-W line of cameras, the ones with double digit numbers, now use only proprietary lithium batteries.AAAAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!Will somebody please explain to the idiots at Sony that the main advantage of a camera that uses AA batteries instead of a proprietary rechargeable lithium battery is that AA batteries are ubiquitous, i.e., you can find them anywhere and everywhere at almost anytime.Once, with the DSCW1, the batteries ran out while I was at a big family gathering. I literally ran out to a drugstore and bought some AA batteries, and everything went just fine.  Try, oh try doing that with a proprietary lithium battery.That's right, lithium batteries are NEVER charged when you want them to be.  Leave the camera or battery on the charger, and the battery gets killed off much faster.  Buy an extra, spare battery, leave it on a spare charger, and you end up killing off this spare battery before it ever sees any use.  Or, you forget to bring a spare with you.  Or you bring it with you, don't use it, and you forget to recharge it,  and the next time you need the camera, none of the proprietary batteries in your collection work.  Every one of these scenarios has happened to me with my camcorders, which have always required rechargeable lithium batteries.I just absolutely HATE proprietary lithium batteries!  Especially for an otherwise extremely handy, easy to use, point and shoot camera that is ideal for spontaneous family photos.  Rechargeable proprietary lithium batteries and \"spontaneous\" are complete oxymorons.So get the few remaining ones left of this camera now, before the dwindling supplies completely run out.P.S. - one of the Spotlight Reviews that Amazon unfortunately chose for this camera makes several very uninformed and misleading statements.  The reviewer simply has not read the manual and made adjustments to the default settings for this camera.  It is very easy to turn off all the annoying sounds that this camera makes.  The camera focuses much better if set on \"Center Focus\" rather than the default multifocus mode (especially in complicated scenes).  If you use the manual mode and set it to ISO 400, the camera speed will be much faster and there is less motion (default is ISO 100).  When using the flash mode, make sure that the \"SL\" flash mode is not turned on, this invariably produces blurry pictures - best to leave the camera on Auto flash mode.  All three of these tips will sharply reduce the number of blurry pictures taken with this camera.The camera is very small and it is fairly easy to accidentally hit and activate one of these buttons, and change the settings, so you have to always check your settings regularly.  When the camera is set properly, the shutter always goes off very quickly after pressing the button - delays happen mainly if the camera senses a need for a flash and the flash is still charging.  There is also a \"Timer\" mode which is VERY EASY to hit accidentally with your thumb, and this will, of course, start the timer, and produce a delay in when the shutter goes off.  So, repeat, ALWAYS check your settings and make sure you're not in one of these oddball modes.  Finally, if you really need to capture a series of shots that fast, this camera comes with two multishot modes - one that takes a very rapid series of shots, and one that takes a slower sequence.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great upper-class digicam!", "Author": "Method2Madness \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R2946WT3T4UHKC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this as a replacement for the dreaded Nikon L1, for my fiance, with a 1Gig MS Pro and couldn't be more happy. The pictures are VERY clear, colors perfectly saturated and the processor is pretty darn speedy! The only reason I rated this a 4 star instead of a 5 is the 3x zoom is still a little short for a camera in this price range. The camera is also not too bad on batteries, although not as power-savy as the Canon, you can expect about 125-175 photos on a set of 2000mah NiMh batteries and about half that on Alkalines(NOT reccomended). This camera also has a GREAT video mode and the AF assist lamp makes pictures taken in \"less than optimal\" lighting conditions darn near blur-free! 7.2MP photos(I leave mine on 5MP as not too many people actually NEED 7.2MP) and the Mpeg Movie VX take a LOT of space so make sure you get a Memory Stick Pro with at LEAST 512mb of storage.

The Canon got better reviews but was considerably more expensive. Having already had a Sony camera previously I preferred sticking with the same brand (I was very happy with my Sony 2 megapixel camera) but this camera (W7) has several negative reviews here on Amazon (lense retract breaks easy, poor support from sony, etc...). So, what to do? I decided to take a chance and get the Sony DSC-W7 anyway... and spend an extra $30 for a 2 year warranty. After doing so and using the camera for a couple of weeks now I must say that I am very pleased with it. It takes very nice looking photos, sharp and with good color. I've had no problems with the camera but even if I do I can get it fixed for FREE... and I still saved $120 over the cost of the Canon SD550 even with the extended warranty. I guess I'm writing this review to tell others who may be apprehensive like I was that it's a good camera at a great price.

Lastly, vivid and sharp pictures even at the lowest resolution (VGA email image size).What I am missing:1. Sony should have considered adding a \"hot shoe\" pad for a detachable flash.2. On the CD ROM supplied, I wish that the \"movie maker\" application software was enabled to make longer movies. I wanted a movie  for about 248 pictures, however, the program limits the number of the images to be displayed based on the \"lenght\" of the background music.

I can shoot from across a field and read the text on the tiny road signs on the otherside if I zoom in on the computer.  That is how good the resolution is.  To the people who get blurry pictures, you must understand that this is the case with any camera. If you don't hold the camera still you will get blurring. The same thing happens with a non digital camera. The auto mode on the camera works fairly well but if you have shakey hands you can get blurry pictures. If you are shooting shots with a really slow shutter speed then use a tripod or make sure that you hold the camera very still. Also the camera has multiple types of focus and a small warning that flashes on the screen that alerts you to the possibility of a blurry picture.(If the camera is shaking or focused on something very far away etc. with a low speed) Focusing the camera on what you want is really easy. Press the shoot button lightly and the outline of the focus area will turn green, then you can move the camera to change the composition of the shot. In doors and at short distances an amber light is shown upon the subject and a green dot appears on the screen.  The screen also has a histogram view which allows you to see the light composition which can be very helpful.  The movies that the camera takes are also very very good, and it does have a mic for audio.(Something some Sonys lack).

Trust me..I WANT to love this camera, but I just can't.  It takes blurry pictures.  I have been taking pictures a long time with manual SLRs and I have an idea about shutter speeds, apertures, etc.Even when the pictures appear to come out great on the camera slideshow, I cannot guarantee that this will translate to my computer monitor.  Often a picture will have acceptable light levels on my camera viewscreen and be almost entirely black on the computer (Yes i have turned up my monitor's brightness and tried this on different monitors).Back to blurriness.  Even shooting this camera at 1000 at 400iso, I often get a blurry picture.  For those who say \"HOLD STILL\"--like everyone who has poor results is  raving, arm-waving lunatic--I have been holding still, but there is a limit to how still a human can be.  Regardless, even moving and shooting at a shutterspeed of 1000 should yield a clear result--which I am not achieving.I have no doubt that many people have had good results with this model.  Perhaps there is just a bad batch out there?  I for one have not had generally good results.  Some good pictures, yes.  But when only 20 out of 150 pictures are acceptable to my standards, I have to take issue with that.I have experimented with this camera extensively and I truly want to make it work--I don't have the expendable income to go out and buy another model.  I believe I am a competent photographer, and being vexed by a point and shoot is doing little to boost my self-esteem.  A point-and-shoot, by definition, is supposed to be easy to operate and achieve acceptable results.

Those settings i spoke about are fairly easy to navigate when you need more control (as i do) above and beyond the High Quality automatic setting on the Sony for taking snapshots and such.  The Olympus has a very bright much larger lens than the Sony W7, but the Sony is superior in many ways.  The first, and most important, is that when i click the shutter, i get a photo.  Not two seconds later, but right now.  My wife, a dancer, also loves the quailty of photos taken in low light and movement both with and without a flash.  Sure, there is a little bit of low light loss of quailty with the Sony AND the flash disabled, but... i am asking a pocket style camera to do the work of a high quality 35 mm slr or the large frame Olympus 4040 used to do (till it failed, which is the reason for the Sony purchase).  I also owned a Nikon for about 24 hours (similar to the Sony in size and what it says it will do) but i found out after frustration, the Nikon does not do what it says it will.  I had focus problems like other people who bought the Nikon camera.  So, i was getting 'very-high-quality-out-of-focus-photos' with the Nikon... enough said.Parents (and sportsmen/women) will LOVE this camera (the Sony DSC-W7) because they can actually get those impromptu photos children (animals and sports) are so famous for!  (I've got some close up shots of chipmunks and birds at the window feeder!) The camera turns on and is ready to shoot in just over one second (on my watch) and when you hit the shutter (with flash disabled) it's like the 35mm's instantainous shutter... THIS CAMERA DOES MORE!  The quality of those photos is almost cruel to the passing of time, it is now frozen on film... as it were.The Sony has made me 'the photographer' of my wife's bellydance troupe.

In addition, it's ridiculously cumbersome to turn on and off, since you have to go into an annoying menu to do so, rather than just hit the flash button, as with the Canon Elphs.Lastly, while I love the battery life and memory stick indicators, the lack of an auto-rotate feature is unacceptable.In summary, while the images are decent, they don't appear to be all that much better than a 5 or even 3.2 mega pixel camera, at least on my computer screen. And for a point and shoot, the focusing should be a lot more reliable. So unless Sony fixes these problems, I won't be buying another one of their digital cameras.

Naturally, I was apprehensive because it appeared to me that there were as many positive reviews as negative ones. But I got a good deal on this camera and bought it anyway.This is my first digital camera so all I know about cameras is my experience with analogs. I was super anxious about my first shots -- so when I took them and checked out the results -- they were as good as I could expect. Maybe my expectations have been lowered by the negative reviews!!I have tried a whole lot of types of shots (broad daylight, pitch dark night, indoor daytime, indoor night time with incandescent light, indoor nighttime with fluorescent light, close up, maximum zoom, fast movement) and everything looks pretty good. I just wonder what difference the others noticed from their Canon/Nikon cameras -- wish they put in some snaps to explain the difference. Maybe when I get a chance to see pictures taken with those cameras will I notice the difference.But from whatever I can discern with my human eyes -- the quality of the pictures look excellent and color is also pretty good (in fact much better than what I got from my analogs -- which had no consistency). It appears to me that Sony uses software to condition the shots after they had been clicked to compensate for various factors. Also the flash works very well. I was pleasantly surprised at the end results from most of the shots. I have not noticed the focus problem (the people have mentioned) yet.The only item I would have liked to get with the camera is a carrying case. The rechargeable battery works well, but it is a good idea to get an extra pair. I got a 256Mb Memory stick with the camera -- and fell that also is needed.All in all -- a good camera and I would recommend it.Update (after using for 4 months):================================2 problems I need to mention :1) picture is grainy at high iso (but I have not found a camera which is better in this departments at this price)2) it's almost impossible to take pictures with long exposures unless you have a super steady hand (or a tripod). Doesn't make any sense in providing these features in a point and shoot camera if a tripod is needed. In fact I see that the \"shaking hands\" are displayed even when I have the camera set on a table top --- obviously Sony has used this \"feature\" very conveniently to cover for deficiencies in their electronics.

Her Canon is already completely broken, and my Sony DSC-W7 is going strong. My pictures are AMAZING, and while some do come out blurry, that is going to happen with most point-and-shoot cameras or SLR cameras set on automatic settings. Action shots are more difficult, but again, they usually are on SLR cameras. The multi-burst function has always worked for me when I wanted to get a shot of something in action, as does the video setting ;). So you take five times as many pictures. That's the beautfy of digital cameras... you can erase 90% of them. Indoor lighting causes problems for most cameras, but I've found that if I swtich the top dial to the \"people\" mode that most of that problem is eliminated. To speak a litle more about the different settings on that top dial. I've taken some really great night shots using the \"night\" setting, and some great landscapes with the \"mountain\" setting.The Carl Zeiss lenses are fantastic, and I think that's one of the reasons the pictures come out well. I also LOVE the fact that I can use AA batteries. I love to travel, and the ability to buy batteries anywhere is indispensible. My parents just bought a new 8.1MP Sony camera, and while we were looking at different models, I noticed that all the new cameras require special, expensive, and inconvenient-for-traveling batteries. I am jealous that they have more megapixels, and that their camera is half the size of mine, but... win some, lose some.I think the controls and features on the camera are pretty standard, I don't think there's much to say about them. The larger screen is becoming pretty standard too. I looked around and saw that there may be attachments for the Carl Zeiss lenses, which would be great, because the mediocre zoom is a little annoying.I'm kind of surprised that so many people had problems with this camera. As someone who knows their way around cameras, I thought that this was a great camera for a simple point and shoot. I've heard nothing but complaints from everyone I know who has a Canon, althought I've never owned one, it's one of the reasons that I went for the Sony in the first place.

My friend bought a Nikon 5 MP at a department store last week.  We got together and took photos (using each other's cameras and switching off) of the same subjects with both cameras - still shots, kids, animals, scenic views.I was embarrassed.  Drat, my much more expensive SONY, which cost double the price of her Nikon, took blurry photos.  40% were blurry.  My SONY is easier to use, easier to download pics, easier to load memory sticks.  But hands-down her Nikon takes better pictures.  I was horrified to say the least. There is nothing I hate more than blurry photos.  I can't return it because SONY has a no returns clause with most of their sellers.  So I'm stuck with it.Update 4/17/06:  More complaints. 1. The useless noise it makes when you turn it on is totally unnecessary!  I hate it.  2. SLOW SHUTTER SPEED - the time it takes for the shutter to go off.  I frequently miss action shots.  So I am no happier with this camera this year than last, and will probably buy a different one soon. Too bad as I loved my last 3 MP SONY.Update 9/4/09:  This is not the camera for anything to do with zooming in on a shot. If you engage the zoom AT ALL, your photo is very blurry and useless. The zoom is useless on it. It's heartbreaking. I've owned this camera for about four years. The only thing we use it for is landscapes, scenery, car shows, large group shots, etc. Nothing up close.

Thanks Amazon!).I purchased my DSC-W5 a little over a year ago and have been very pleased with it. The main reasons I decided to purchase this camera was its small size and the fact that you could get an underwater housing for it. I've had other underwater cameras but I found this one to be great above and below the water. With the housing being so small you can use it at the beach/pool or the big waterfest, Songkran, in Thailand without worrying about getting it wet.The other things that I've really liked since I purchased it is the manual setting (good for underwater and sun sets) and the ability to use standard AA batteries (this has saved me many times when my rechargeable have gone dead). I have also purchased the zoom lens... It helps the  3X zoom. When using the zoom  you sometimes get the black hole effect on the edges, but you just have to work around it or crop it later. I've thought about the underwater filters but Sony is very proud of them (ie. to expensive). I just use a Photoshop action in Elements called underwater that I got from the Adobe's share site to color correct pix's.The video is good also. I've used it for underwater and the high quality setting gives you a pretty good video even on my 50\" HD TV. It does eat up a lot of space on the 1G chip, but what do you want... (may need to order a bigger one if they're now available)Friends of mine have liked my camera so much they've purchased the W7. Another thing I'm hoping is Sony will continue the line so you can purchase accessories in the future (underwater housing, I had an Olympus/5050 with underwater housing, but after a year or so you could not find replacement accessories so I had to buy a new camera (ie. W5).The only con on the camera is the red eyes from the flash being so close to the lens. But then I use Elements to fix that in a jiffy.Other features that would make it even better are (Sony are you listening): More manual settings. I would like it to have the infrared capability of other Sony's. Another feature that would be great and don't understand why companies have not added it would be... time-laps photography using the video or still capability.", "Date": "November 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Les Saisons de Ma Vie \"mariacc\"", "ReviewID": "R1BUI4KDF3ERVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes fabulous digital pictures.

The pictures were fantastic until I crashed the lens into something harder than it was and put a tiny chip near the center of the lens.While normal photos are still fine with the chipped lens ones taken tough a microscope have some flare and loss of contrast due to light being scattered by the chip. The way a microscope forms an image from a very small subject makes problems in the camera lens about 3 or 4 times worse with a microscope than it is with normal photos.The W7 has been a work horse for me for 5 years or so. I haven't had any problem others seem to have in spite of the fact I use and don't baby equipment.The quality of the image and lack of artifacts introduced by lens when used with a microscope more than make up for Kluge of the dial settings, no raw image format and lack of software control of the camera functions.  I expect the image quality is  due to the simple Zeiss lens with minimal zoom range and not so much with the rest of the Sony camera.I would be happier if there were a mode that turned the camera into a box that held a sensor and let me control the rest.It gets 5 stars not so much on it merits but on the fact it takes better pictures than other cameras I have tried and has no problems I can't work around.

Also, the sharpening is a bit too aggressive, and in high contrast situations, you have the problem of power lines disappearing into the sky background.  However, you can minimize this by setting the sharpening to minimum.  Color fringing is minimal, no problem at all.  I use the manual setting a lot with the histogram on, but I wish there were more than two apertures to choose.  Long exposures on a tripod are excellent.  I like the square, chunky shape because I can hold it securely.  Finally, the auxiliary wide angle lens is also remarkably good.  Obviously, it introduces some distortion, but for normal prints (up to 8x10\") almost no one would see any optical faults.  I also bought the Sony polarizer, which was a great help in some settings.  The main item that Sony does not make for this model is a is sun hood, a strange omission for a camera that is capable of  professional quality results.  Hint, you can make a hood out of a cardboard toilet paper roll center.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the beginner.", "Author": "R.

Before that I was happy with my old 3MP Sony DSC-S70 which I had for over 5 years before I did the upgrade.- My biggest complain is from the non-working Auto-Focus. Even in a day light you may get 50% of the pictures completely out-of-focus and useless. I get used to set Focus manually if I want to get pictures on Focus but is not very practical at least- On movie the camera is USELESS too, due to the constantly fluctuating Auto-Focus. A way around is to set the distance manually which is not what a movie is all about. What a shame for 5* Review I've read before I bought it 10 months ago- Zoom range is not practical. Don't have wide angle for close up and only 3x zoom is not enough.- In Standard (compressed) mode pictures are OK on a day light (saves space) but on a night shots are so compressed that you loose so many pixels and you can't zoom into. So who cares if it saves space and the picture is useless.- Flash recharge time is terribly slow besides that is so weak that you can't use it more than 2-3 feet away. I had to buy Sony HVLFSL1B External Slave Flash for ~ $73.76 which helped but you have to carry it too.- The CCD broke after 6 months while the camera was still under warranty and Sony fixed it. They replaced the lens too because they found it bad too. It took them almost a month to repair it.- even on a bright day, most of the pictures are little underexposed+ the only positive thing is the excellent battery life+ picture has good contrast and colorOverall I'm extremely disappointed and I'm looking for a replacement.I only don't how I can trust Camera review(s) since by the time I bought it, the camera had excellent (5*) reviews both  from experts and users.I rate it with single (1*) and now (10 months later) I'm reading that other users have similar experience.I don't see a reason why anybody should buy this model :-(", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Hate It!!!", "Author": "Tara \"tnp\"", "ReviewID": "R3OLAOKHH3MYOQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a Christmas gift last year from my husband.

Well, I listened to the complaints and bought this Sony DSCW7 this time, with 512MB in addition to the built-in 32 MB.I can simply say the following: Canon Gs series (now G6) are definitely better; the grip, the precision of focusing, the quality of lenses, the duration of the batteries, and the techniques of the LCD screen.One can always argue that Sony turns difficult and complicated programs and manuals to an almost kid's play procedures, this is correct, but the Software of Canon was as easy as Sony, and the procedures of taking the pictures is also as easy with Canon as it is with Sony. Therefore, I really cannot recommend buying this camera instead of the G6 to anyone; it bypasses my old dear G2 with three things: it is 7MP instead of 4.2MP, it records video shots subject to the capacity of the memory card instead of 30seconds ones for the Canon and it is much faster in taking the shot; but I assume that Canon G6 will do the same.My Canon had to be repaired once during these 30 months, this would be highly unusual for the Sony that is more compact and much fun and easy to use.
