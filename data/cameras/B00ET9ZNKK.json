I took over 50 pictures of outside and inside scenes and had to correct almost all of them in Photoshop.  The lower end of the spectrum was clipped almost every time using both the AUTO and LIVE settings.  I was looking forward to using this camera for travel because of its compact size and the features that it offers.  I sent the camera back to the supplier.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.00", "Features": "16.0 Megapixel sensor\nCanon DIGIC 4 Image Processor\n16x Optical Zoom\n28mm Wide-Angle lens with Optical Image Stabilizer\n720p HD video in stereo sound", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX170 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom and 720p HD Video (Black) Super Bundle With DigPro 32GB High Speed Card , Digpro Deluxe Case, Deluxe Cleaning Kit ,Spare Battery, Tripod", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4180dcuUM7L.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ET9ZNKK"}}
