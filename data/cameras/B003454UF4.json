{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad for the price...  Camera's are not that great.", "Author": "Chris C.", "ReviewID": "R2AW0OPBOTP742", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This system is a nice starter system - HOWEVER, the cameras are not that great.  The DVR is nice, it can be viewed from a Mac via Safari or Firefox.  I had the system up and running in about 10 minutes.  I was able to connect it to my network, and setup port forwarding on my Apple Airport in about 10 more minutes.  Before I knew it I had the apple iPad app and iPhone app up and running on viewing a camera looking at my back yard. Obviously the real work will require running cable, drilling holes and mounting cameras - I was in a hurry to try out the system to decided if I wanted to keep it before doing all that work.  During my testing I noticed the following:1) Mac support was good.  I will post some photo's.  It has a nice interface, and works well.2) Video quality of the system was poor.  I assume this is from the cameras as I hooked them directly to a TV and wasn't very impressed.3) Blackberry app is just \"OK\" - it works, but not the greatest and required some configuration my employer does not allow on my blackberry4) The native mac application \"Video Viewer\" saves video files in a format that only it understands - I cannot seem to open these files with quicktime or another media player.5) The documentation isn't bad, but not great - no idea where I would go for help.6) I realized when I sat down to plan my camera locations, I need more than 4.  The software allows me to have multiple DVRs, which is nice - but I think I will need more than 4 channels.  I would recommend planning your system before buying a 4 channel DVR.  I realized I needed 4 cameras to cover the front and back of my house, not to mention the 2 interior cameras I wanted to install.  8 Channels is probably what I need.7) Camera cables we good - there are cables on Amazon that are very thin which cause noise and bad pictures - the bundled cables were decent.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good system but quite noisy", "Author": "Non Texan \"I call it as I see it\"", "ReviewID": "RKAFU6WXD4NCH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "System works OK,, set up was a little challenging, menus are clunky and not really user friendly.  Still haven't figured out the remote viewing...  DVR is noisy, annoyingly so... now the hard drive has started whining too when the unit first starts up.  Picture quality is adequate for security, but it is relatively low resolution.  500 GB hard drive saves months of data depending on your settings.  I like the system, it suits my needs for basic home security monitoring.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not really quality", "Author": "REBECCA", "ReviewID": "R1TSI0ARUVM3HQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this system and while it was easy to install, unfortunately the DVR broke in less than a year.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.00", "Features": "H.264 4 Channels Video and Audio, 500GB Hard Disk Built in, Real Time 120FPS Recording\n4 x Sony CCD Sensor Day Night IR Bullet Color Cameras up to 65FT, 4x65FT video cables with power wire, 4xPower adapter\nSupprots Seven Mobile Device Platforms: iPad, iPod, iPhone, Andriod, BlackBerry   Nokia, Windows Mobile with Eagleeyes Software\nSupports Five Browser Windows IE, Mozilla FireFox, Mac Safari, Google Chrome   Opera Login on Windows Mac\nAll products have one Year Warranty and Full Technical Supports in USA", "Name": "CIB R401H60W500G8752 4CH Security Surveillance DVR Four CCD Bullet Cameras KIT.
