Best electronics gadget ever!!", "Author": "Gadget Man \"Gagdet Man\"", "ReviewID": "R38D1K9HX03HSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a hi-tech gadget guy who is hard to please, but this far exceeded my expectations! I have it connected from a bedroom Directv Receiver(6\" from a 2.4GHZ wireless PC lan) to a kitchen 15\" Magnanox LCD TV sitting 12\" below a micrwave oven without interference from microwave or lan! I'm even transmitting through 6 walls and a 5 gal. metal potato chip bucket and people walking in the kitchen without affecting the picture! I was getting a super picture w/o even having 1 antenna directly facing the other antenna. I thought I was going to have to run between floors for hours until everything was aligned perfectly - it only took 15 seconds because alignment is very forgiving. Picture quality is 5 star crystal clear with no lines, static, etc. All TV channels are 5 star and the HDTV stations blew me away even though I know its not sending true HDTV though the avs-5811.What surprised me most was that I could use my bedroom Directv remote (down in the kitchen) to change channels (up in the bedroom) by simply pointing at the (kitchen)avs-5811 receiver. It sends the remote control signal upstairs to a \"mouse\" that you place in front of your TV receiver, cable box, etc, IR sensor. I had a spare remote so I keep 1 in kitchen and 1 in bedroom for convenience.The owners manual iS POOR and doesn't tell you all this, but basically I can point the remote at the avs-5811 receiver in kitchen requesting a Directv channel change (or any other remote control function) in the upstairs bedroom. The avs-5811 transmitter in the bedroom receives the request and sends it through the \"mouse\" to the Directv Receiver which changes the channel as requested and the new channel video and sound is return to the kitchen!  Pure magic and ingenious!It is a very cost effective way, without losing picture quality and convenience, to avoid running cables and drill holes through my tiled walls or granite counters.", "Date": "February 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best Wireless A/V Sender out there...If it works for you.", "Author": "Paperback Writer", "ReviewID": "R1SFL1833EHYPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an HP Windows Media Center PC and wanted a wireless A/V solution to enjoy the media content on my PC.  I wanted to send the signal from my PC in my bedroom to my living room where I could hook up the audio to my home theatre system, (to enjoy the digital music and nice sound from recorded shows), and the video to my TV, (to watch movies, pictures, home videos, and TV shows I recorded on my PC).  I live in a condo and I tried (2) other 2.4GHz Wireless A/V senders, (The Radioshack model and a product I got from Best Buy), before I arrived at this gem.  With the 2.4GHz A/V devices I got a lot of interference from my neighbor's wireless routers, microwave ovens, cordless phones, etc., which operate on the 2.4GHz freq. band.  The results I got were unsatisfactory and I was very disappointed that my vision seemed impractical.When I learned of this product which operates on the 5.8GHz band my hope was renewed.  Going up to 5.8 GHz made all the diff. for me as this freq. band is less populated, (for the time being), then the 2.4GHz freq. This product is a great invention and works as advertised.  I wouldn't be able to enjoy the media content on my PC the way that I do if I didn't have it.  The sound and video is crystal clear.  Not only does it do the wireless A/V thing, but it also is a remote control extender.  My PC has a remote and I control my PC in my living room while sitting on my couch.There are only a few negatives things.  I do experience some interference sometimes if someone is walking around in the other room, and the audio transmission is in stereo only, not dolby 5.1 surround sound.  There also is the fear that wireless products will start populating the 5.8GHz freq. band in the coming years and interfere with my product, but I'll cross that bridge later.  Also, anyone wanting to buy this in a retail store is going to be hard pressed to find one.  The 2.4GHz devices are out there, but it seems that this 5.8GHz A/V device is a novelty item.  I only saw the one I bought on the internet, so if someone else buys this thing and it doesn't work for them it will be very cumbersome to try to return. The cost also is about $40-50 more than the 2.4GHz devices I returned, but I think the extra cost is well worth it.  I never tried out how it works on differnt floors.  I think these are small draw backs however.  I love this thing and am well satisfied.  It works great for me.  I've only begun to really fully utilize what I can do with it. 5 stars and I might buy another one!", "Date": "January 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good unit, minor but solvable flaw", "Author": "Dan P.

The RF Link will only broadcast the signal selected on another device, so you can't watch different programs on the primary TV and the wirelessly-connected set. AngelTrax, on the other hand, has its own TV tuner so it will broadcast any cable channel and, at the push of a button, a signal from an AV device (like digital cable or a DVD Player).  The remote for the RF Link is barely functional, relying on an infrared \"mouse\" to send a channel change to the primary device, while the AngelTrax very effectively controls channel, power, and volume on its own tuner.  Both worked fine (minimal interference) in my home in the presence of a 5.8 ghz phone and a wireless network.The RF Link is really quite inferior to the AngelTrax, and it costs more.

Hu", "ReviewID": "R9Y3NLAI1DP1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product does a great job!  I hooked the RF Link transmitter end of the system to my Directv receiver in the basement and the RF Link receiver end to my bedroom tv on the third floor of the house.  This means that the signal penetrates through two floors, three walls, and a lot of furniture, etc, in between.  The RF Link receiver sits right next to a 2.4 GHz WiFi antenna and the RF Link transmitter is right next to the central console of a 5.8 GHz cordless multiple handset system but I don't have any interference problems to/from those systems.  The RF Link system uses a 5.8 GHz frequency but it has 4 channels so as to avoid interfering with your cordless phones.  As others have mentioned, the manual that comes with the system provides very little detail.  I'd say that the key is to point the antennas at each other.  Also, unlike other reviewers, I was able to get the remote control extender to work despite the distance between the units.  I placed the remote control extender mouse directly in front of the Directv receiver's IR eye and pointed the remote control antennas on the RF Link transmitter and receiver units at each other. Using my remote control upstairs, I am able to change channels on the Directv receiver in the basement by pointing at the IR eye on the RF receiver unit upstairs.  The RF Link receiver unit converts the IR signal sent from the remote control to the RF Link receiver unit into a RF signal which is then sent to the other RF transmitter Link unit connected to the Directv receiver downstairs.  So the key point is that you have two antennas on the two RF units, one for the audio/visual signal and one for the remote control extender.  Both of them have to be directed at each other.  I'd highly recommend this system to anyone who wants to avoid running cables, drilling through walls, or buying/leasing another satellite/cable receiver box.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not ready for primetime", "Author": "Burnie_bda", "ReviewID": "R24T89EJEX325B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Picture is clear but for the lines that roll up the screen.

I used this product to transmit the audio/video signal from my Hughes HBH-SA DirecTV satellite receiver to a Zenith 27\" analog TV downstairs.  The video and audio quality is quite good, but the picture quality is not quite as good as a wired connection (but I think the quality is very close to what it would be with a wired connection).  While I am quite pleased with the audio quality, there is a faint buzz in the background--a faint background noise that is barely noticeable, and therefore not a big deal.  Also, I get absolutely no interference of any kind.  One concern I have with this product:  is that 5.8 Ghz cordless phones (which are far less common than 2.4 Ghz or 900 Mhz cordless phones) can interfere with it (although I have not experienced this since I don't own one of these cordless phones).  So even though there are far less wireless products on this frequency, I am slightly concerned that I may get interference in the future if someone too close to me buys a 5.8 Ghz cordless phone.  As many people have said, one of the drawbacks to this product is that you must spend a lot of time fine tuning the connection between the transmitter and receiver until you find that \"sweet spot.\"  This can be time consuming, and required me to move both the transmitter and receiver to different locations, and even buy a 12 foot RCA composite A/V cable so I could move the transmitter to a location that is closer to the receiver.  So, expect the possibility of needing at least one cable that is longer than the cables provided with the product (which are under 6 feet in length).  My biggest issue with this 5.8 Ghz A/V sender receiver was that it was incompatible with the Zenith 27\" TV set it was bought for.  This TV set had an available RCA Composite A/V input; hence an RF Modulator should *not* have been necessary.  Using the TV's Composite input, the video and audio seemed perfect after finding that \"sweet spot\", but I experienced the vertical hold problem that a few other reviewers have mentioned.  The picture would look fine during the show I was watching, but during certain commericals (especially those with white backgrounds) the TV's vertical hold would fail and the picture would flip vertically, sometimes several times.  I initially thought this was a reception issue, and hence I spent too much time adjusting the reception betwen the transmitter and receiver, until I realized it was a compatibility issue.  Also, the TV (during a show or commercial) would randomly reset the video input, resulting in the TV intermittedly showing the current channel and time (as if I pressed the ENTER key on the TV's remote).  I believe the compatibility issue may be the same issue that many people had with certain Zenith TVs and game consoles--it would seem as though the vertical hold problem is a problem with certain older Zenith TV sets (this set was purchased in 1998).  However, I am not sure if this problem can appear on non-Zenith TV sets, so it is clearly something that RF-Link needs to address.  Most people who reviewed the product don't seem to have this issue, so I don't think the vertical hold problem affects most TV sets.  The solution to this problem was to either plug the A/V receiver into one of the VCR's composite inputs, and then view A/V receiver through the VCR on channel 3 or to use an RF modulator.  I bought the RF modulator and am using that, to avoid going through the VCR, since going through the VCR prevents me from watching my satellite TV downstairs while someone is recording something.  Both solutions convert the RCA composite signal from the A/V receiver, to VHF on Channel 3 (or 4).  This conversion eliminates the vertical hold problem, and the resetting problem I described, however, either solution slightly degrades the picture, and converts the audio to Mono.  I have no problem with the *slight* quality loss caused by the RF modulation--it is much better than having to tolerate a flipping picture.  This vertical hold problem was driving me crazy, so I would have returned the product had I not found a workaround.  One other issue with this product.  The remote extender was totally useless for me.  Many people have gotten the remote extender to work, but some have not been successful, like myself.  Even if I put the IR mouse right in front of the satellite receiver, it still would not work properly.  I think it depends on how the A/V transmitter is aligned with the component you are controlling.  Fortunately for me, I happened to already own a Terk LF-UNIV remote extender, so I am using this separate product to extend the range of the remote.  It works very well.  The bottom line is that this product works very well with great quality, but your experience may very depending on your setup.  For me, the drawbacks were that it seemed to take too much effort to find that sweet spot (in my case buying an extra long 12 foot cable for the transmitter to move it closer to the receiver), the product had a major vertical hold issue with the TV set, and the remote extender functionality was worthless.  It is annoying having to use two separate additional products (RF Modulator and Terk remote extender) to make this product work properly (when you consider the high cost of this RF Link product)--this is excluding the 12 foot long cable I had to buy which is not an unreasonable expense.  Despite those drawbacks, good clear video and audio with no interference is great, since there is no way that I can use a wired connection to watch satellite TV on a TV set on a different floor from the satellite receiver.  I simply cannot get a separate satellite receiver for that TV downstairs.  Hence I am very happy with this product.", "Date": "October 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "great picture", "Author": "B.

This allows me to view digital TV on my 19\" CRT monitor, and record on the PC hard drive.Setting it up was very simple.  It works through 5 \"walls\" (including the wood of the built-in where the TV and digtal box reside) between the two units.  The transmitter and receiver were factory set to the third channel (there are four total, each operating at a slightly different frequency around 5.8 GHz), and there was some interference.  But changing both to the first channel solved this problem.The IR mouse was my biggest concern based on the reviews, but turns out, it works very well.  I had to make sure that it was placed in \"line of sight\" to the IR sensor of the digital box.The quality of the picture is approximately DVD quality (although the ATI HDTV card may be upscaling the signal).

I placed the receiver on its side using the Maxtor HD holder for side orientation I had to help with the cooling and put the transmitter on a metal plate to get the heat away. There is an occasional  bit of jitter on my TV but with these fixes and tweaking of the orientation the signal is fine over 50 feet through walls. I had problem with a 10 year old Sony 9 inch TV (vertical roll) and used that as an excuse to buy a  13\" LCD to put under the cabinet freeing up counter space. The sharp Aquous LCD did not have any vertical roll but does jitter once in a while.  There is horizontal tearing on bright scenes once in a while. This probably due to the intensity of the composite input.  This is not much of a problem in real viewingIR transmitter tweaks.I discarded the mouse which really doesn ot work well and used the double IR extender I got with my RCA TV. There are two little boxes attached to a mino stereo plug. I went to Radio Shack and got a mini to mini mini plug and then attached the output to the Sender unit.  The unit apprently sends out IR noise  even when it is not being sent things by the receiver so I had to place the ittle IR light boxes a bit away from the the the sensor on my Sony DSS unit and my Onkyo receiver so that I could use my system locally when I was not using it in the ktichen.With these tweaks I get a good picutre in the kitchen and the DSS remote works fine from the kitchen or from our bedroom.  An earlier try with a Radio Shack version at 2.4 did not work due to our 2.4 2 wireless phones and perhaps our 802.g network so the 5.8ghz unit is very important in our household. I have decided to leave it on all the tmie now since it does need to warm up before it works perfectly. I hope this will not cut down the life time too much.Bottom line it works but requires effort.

Over this relatively short range, the digital tv picture is nearly as good as on the main tv.  No interference problems whatsoever, and in my situation it doesn't matter much what direction the antennae are facing.Of course, YMMV -- some homes have interior wall construction that can drastically reduce the range of wireless devices.Additionally: -- The IR remote extender does work, and works well, however it is by far the most difficult part of the setup, and the instructions give almost no help with this part.  Here's what you need to do:-Connect the IR mouse to the transmitter, and place the IR mouse DIRECTLY in front of and facing the remote sensor of the device you are trying to control.  This location is only temporary - you just want to make sure it has a clear line of site while you adjust the transmitter and receiver.-Now play with the location of the transmitter and receiver, one at a time.  It's easiest if you have someone to help you by trying to operate the remote while you adjust the transmitter and receiver.  Keep in mind that the ideal position of the antennae is 90 degrees offset -- that is if one is straight up, the other should be horizontal to the surface it's sitting on.  Once you have a functional remote, and are happy with the location of the transmitter and receiver, leave them in position, and now adjust the position of the IR mouse.  I managed to fix mine to the underside of the shelf above my DVR box, facing back at the DVR, making it almost invisible.  Operating the remote tv is now just like sitting in front of the main tv.Overall I give this unit 4 stars only because it would have been nice if the transmitter and receiver were designed to blend in better with a typical electronics rack, and they are finicky enough about placement that I'm not able to hide them as well as I would have liked.

So I bought another RF-Link AVS 5811 so I could transmit the signal from the bedroom's Direct TV receiver to the kitchen.  I only needed the transmitter half of this set, but bought the whole set so i could then receive either signal in yet another room.  The second RF-Link transmitter produced a noisy, unreliable signal from the bedroom.  To verify that the transmitter was the problem, i connected the first one in the bedroom.  Clean signal. So I packaged the second one back up and returned it, and ordered another.  The third one came today. I hooked it up and it works perfectly.  The IR repeater to the bedroom doesn't work yet.

But shortly after hooking it up, I find that I have never been so impressed with a gadget I have bought.The problem I wanted to solve was that I have a Directv DVR receiver in the basement, and I wanted to watch the shows I recorded on it in my bedroom upstairs (I live in a townhouse).  I did not want to purchase another DVR receiver since I like having my recorded shows on one unit rather than on two.After research I chose this product.  The customer ratings are what sold me.  Shipping was fast and setup was a breeze - just plug in the rca plug on either end of each unit, plug it in and switch it on!  I pointed my basement unit's antenna up about 45 degrees to get it in the general direction of the TV upstairs and adjusted the upstairs unit to point in the general direction of the downstairs one.  It worked immediately.  Several reviews have noted signal interruption when someone walks in the path of the signal.  There is no signal interruption for me because both tvs are on the same wall of the house.  What is amazing to me is the distance at which it is working with no problem.  through 2 floors and a wall!  Even better, the remote control IR to RF to IR works fine from that distance as well.  Some remote commands have not been picked up on the first push, but after some adjusting with the mouse, I have had no failure that have been constant.A couple of notes.  Video quality is not HD, its more like VHS quality.  But what do you expect with a wireless setup?  Plus my upstairs tv is not the latest technology available.  Also, this costs about as much as another DVR unit would be, but I opted for this for the convenience of having all my shows in one box not two.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent remote video transmitter", "Author": "Alexander Razdolski \"Alex R.\"", "ReviewID": "R2TIMP6D8BI1XW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for this solution for years.

The infrared upstream re-transmit function is 'stupid'. In other words, it transmits all IR energy that the photo diode gets triggered by; basically an IR storm at the head-end. If you have a tube TV in the receiver location, there is a ton of IR coming off the screen. I found this IR storm (noise) was able to over-ride my DirecTV receiver's living room remote when I used the IR mouse. The receive activity light on the transmitter nearly constantly flickers, even when my TV is off. Even a laptop with an infrared port can cause the receiver to transmit the output of the laptop into my livingroom.If RF-Link could make this a 'smart' infrared receiver that rejects non-modulated IR signals that fall outside the 'normal' remote control frequencies 36Khz to 56Khz, it would be a much better solution.It gets three stars simply because it has IR upstream issues that caused me a bunch of extra work.

If anything changes my opinion of 5 stars (I hardly ever give 5 stars), I'll update this review.We had an old, half broken bunny-ears antenna hooked up before, but sometimes it worked poorly, so we decided we needed either a new antenna, or install a cable TV outlet.  While researching antennas, I came across this and decided that if it works, we'd have the best of both worlds.The transmission distance in my case is not very far, so I expected that to be a non-issue.  The transmitter is in a bedroom and the receiver is in the kitchen, which is almost directly below the bedroom.  So I'd say about 15' through the floor/ceiling.  The A/V quality is great and the remote works as if the cable box is local, even with the microwaves and all the 5.8 GHz phones & access points in the house running.  The TV it's connected to is very small (19\"), so that probably helps with the quality.I was debating whether I should just get a cable outlet installed, but I thought about the fact that 97% of the time, no one is watching the bedroom TV at the same time someone is watching the kitchen TV.  For the other 3%, we can either watch the same thing or one of us can choose to watch a disc, Netflix, errr I mean Amazon Prime, or something else.  So since I don't need to get an extra cable box, I will definitely save money in the not-too-long run by not paying box rental or any other fees.  Additionally, it gives us the option to occasionally put the TV on the other side of the kitchen when we need extra space to work.  Or maybe even the garage when we hang out there (haven't tested reception there, however).I haven't yet had it long enough to definitely say I would recommend this product, but based on the ease of setup and how it's working now, I would.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "Aj from CO", "ReviewID": "R1P1ILDMES0HH8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Without having to run new cabling in a home already constructed, this sends the signal straight through the walls to power your TV.

I decided to take it apart since I thought it might be a temperature drift issue because it was hot near the back.  After I opened it up, it was very hot by the heat sink. After a bit, it started working fine again.  I then cut out the \"fins\" under the antenna compartment and then put the cover back on.  It did work a little while longer, but started to drift again.  After blowing on the unit, the picture & sound drifted back in again.  I decided to keep the cover off of it and because it's kind of hidden, it's not a big deal.

I took it up to the 2nd floor, and after some antenna adjustment, the picture and sound is just fine.  The remote control also works fine through 2 floors (there are no walls between the floors).I bought this used for just over $60, so the warranty didn't matter and since I used to be an EE, why not try to fix it?  The remote extender cable was also broken at the tip, but I cut the cable and soldered on a new jack and now it works just fine. I actually found an old 30\" LCD flat screen one day and this is hooked up to that (no HDMI), but it would be very nice if there was a system with S-Video (not necessarily HDMI which exists).

I live in an apartment and had it hooked up to my DVR in the living room and transmitting to my bedroom with a clear line of sight about 100 feet away.  The 5.8ghz band didn't interfere with my 5ghz band 802.11ac router broadcasts and I had good signal connectivity.  I had the 2.4 ghz equivalent before but the transmission was constantly being interrupted by all the 802.11g wifi activity around my apartment building.  About the only time I had a signal problem was when I was physically between the antennae.(Note the transmitter and receiver antenna are directional and rotatable and you'll want them pointing directly at each other for best performance/range)The downside to these is that they only support standard definition (SD) signals (requiring me to keep changing my DVR output to 480i instead of 1080i) and while there's a switch to turn them off it's a nuisance to do so and they'll end up staying on 24/7.The downsides are minor, however and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.

I wrote in the \"discussions forum\" (Aug,2012), but never wrote about what happened when I bought the second sender-receiver set.\"I bought my first RF-Link sender and receiver in Aug of 2009. It worked perfectly, and since, I have bought three other receivers, all working well. I do have a tv in a guest bedroom, and when someone is staying there, I move one of the receivers. OK. I decided this summer to buy another for that room, and when it came, it didn't have that little stick antenna on it, and didn't work. I tried it at all existing receiver locations, which I know work, and it didn't. I even moved a little tv to the room the sender is in, and no luck, so I returned it. I bought one then on Ebay. They were using a stock photo, but when it came, it didn't have the antenna, and didn't work either. Now, I am thinking that if I buy the sender-receiver combo (the photo shows antennas on both) for about $20 more, I'll get a receiver with an antenna. Would someone who has recently (within the last couple months) bought the set check if the stick antenna is on the receiver? Thanks\"Well, the new set also doesn't have antenna sticks, and when I replaced my 2009 sender with the new one, the new transmitter would not send a pix to  any of the three 2009 receivers, so if you already have ones with antennas, I think it is important for you to know they are not compatible.I did solve the problem though.. I put my DVD recorder in another room, and connected the 2009 receiver to it, ran an HDMI cord to the tv, so I had a picture on that tv,  and connected the new transmitter to the OUT holes (red white yellow) of the recorder, so one set-up  has both a 2009 receiver and a 2012 transmitter on  it, and everything is now working fine.

It's used to broadcast from a DirecTV box.  I've tried it with 2 different TV's with mixed results.Broadcasting to a TV approx 25 feet away, and a floor down, it actually works pretty well.  There's a slight delay with the IR receiver/sender, but on the whole I'm quite impressed by it, especially given it's going through the floor with no line of sight.Swapping it to TV#2 wasn't so good.  This TV is maybe 45 feet away, but is almost line of sight.  Standing at the unit it is relatively easy to get a good picture and if you go and sit down in front of the TV it works like TV#1.  However if someone walks through that \"line of sight\" between the units, then the picture will flicker and pop, just like a set of rabbit ears.  Closing a door also seems to affect it.  It really does seem to operate like an antenna rather than a wireless sender/receiver - very open to disruption.I also want to add that the antenna's are very flimsy.  The plastic on my sender broke pretty much straight out the box and I now have a lovely printed circuit board sticking up in the air.Finally, I agree with others regarding the aesthetics and the glowing red \"eye of sauron\".  Not pretty.So it'll go back in my basement and work fine.

For years, I longed for a TV in the Kitchen so I can watch something while cooking.  I kicked myself many times for not installing a cable outlet in the kitchen when we built our house.  When we decided to remodel the kitchen recently, the idea of fishing the cable from basement and cutting through the cabinet and walls came up.  However, it was so much work it's almost not worth it.  I acidentally discovered a wireless transmitter like this one in Best Buy, so I started researching online.  I finally decided on this model because it's relatively inexpensive and seemed to meet my needs.  After reading some of the negative reviews, my expectations were quite low. Once I receive the product, I was able to quickly install it with the cables that came with it, and I got near perfect picture and sound instantly. The manaul was quite basic like many people mentioned, but you really don't need it because there are only a few AV cables to plug.Here are some details about my experience so far after about 1-month usage:1. my set up did not involve going through walls.  The receiver and transimitter are about 20' from the family room to kitchen.  It does not matter whether the little antennas are pointed toward each other or not2. The cable box from my cable company already has the AV output plugs for the transmitter. I did not have to turn on the main TV to watch the remote TV in the kitchen.  Certain TV channels tend to show frequent static sounds which can be quite annoying, but other channels are fine at the same time.3. With the re-modeling in the kitchen going on, I had to remove the receiver and TV a few times.  All it took was unplug two electrical plugs and it took less than 10 secounds.Overall, I'm VERY happy with the results, especially considering it came with so little work and so inexpensively comparing to the alternative - instally the hard wired cable!", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised", "Author": "Randall Catalano", "ReviewID": "R33NM5NB41FJ32", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This device works as advertised and it was very easy to set it up.

So I set up the transmitter in the entertainment center in my living room.  By far the majority of the set up time was running the power cord to the power strip and luckily I had video and audio component cables already run.  So plugged in the power and the video/audio cables, turned it on. Then carried the receiver, video/audio cables (included with the product), power supply and headed to the basement.  Then powered up the TV, the receiver, plugged in the video/audio cables, and turned to video1 on the TV.  And there was the picture and audio!  And it looked like I was watching TV in the living room.  It was crisp and clear.  Grant it, the distance from transmitter to receiver is not very far, probably only 30ft at most.So then it was time to test the remote extender, so I first pointed the transmitter at the two components I wanted to control from the remote, and brought down the remote to the basement, pointed it at the receiver, and immediately the channel changed.  Both components were controlled just as if I was pointing the remote directly at them.  So now I could turn on my stereo receiver and satellite receiver and change channels.So the final test was using the IR mouse so I could  hide away the transmitter in my entertainment center and drop the IR mouse down the front to hopefully be able to transmit the IR to both components, without being too conspicuous  Again it worked perfectly.

I have a small cable box that I'm using that my cable company provided when all broadcasts were moved to digital and the only output on the box is coax.  How I got around it is I'm using my DVD recorder to basically convert the signal from coax to RCA and then sending it to the transmitter.  So basically I have the cable coming into the house going to the cable box which outputs via coax.  That coax goes into my DVD recorder then I use the RCA output to go into the transmitter.

Please don't get me wrong... I've had the AngelTrax for many years and it worked great. But something seemed to change after the \"digital TV conversion\" happened (whether or not it was just a coincidence is pure speculation).At any rate, I've always had some popping and cracking when someone walked through the path of the transmitter/receiver, but the reception on my remote TV got really bad as well. At first I thought it was just my remote TV going out, but then I started having issues with my wireless computer network too... the signal to the remote computer started dropping out sporadically for no apparent reason. Another coincidence? The final straw came when I bought a new 19\" LCD TV and hooked it up... the reception was nothing short of horrific.SOOO... After reading the reviews for the RF-Link AVS-5811, I decided to take a chance. Several reviewers noted that most similar products have a 2.4GHz transmission rate (like my old one) that can cause interference with other wireless stuff such as telephones and computer networks, so the 5.8GHz transmission rate of the RF-Link seemed to make sense as a possible solution to my problems.All I can say is: Hallelujah, Amen!!!! The RF-Link is worth it's weight in diamonds! The new LCD TV's reception/picture is fabulous; there's no popping/cracking; and although may be too early to tell for sure, my wireless computer network has been working flawlessly!Needless to say, I'm a VERY happy camper, and couldn't be more pleased with this purchase!As a final endorsement, I should state that the placement of my RF-Link is pretty challenging...

After purchasing a new 22\" Envision HD TV for patio use, I hooked it up to my old 2.4 unit and the audio was fine however the picture was terrible with ghosting images, it was worse than the 15 year old tv I had been using.  At first I thought the TV was defective until I hooked it up with component cables and the picture was beautiful. I ordered the RF-Link 5.8 unit and received it today.  The ghosting is gone and the picture is near HD.  The patio TV is approximately 40' away from the Comcast cable box with 2 walls in between. The remote sender also worked right away with the attenae set vertically and with both units set to \"D\" no adjustments were necessary for a clear beautiful picture.  I also tested my 5.8 cordless telephone next to the receiver with no interference. If you are struggling with an outdated 2.4 unit, you really should try this.

I settled on the DVR since it was the only unit with the classic yellow/white/red cable outputs.  The AVS-5811 comes only with these cables, and their documentation only discusses this option.  There are other outputs on the DVR (S-Video, for example), but no other output options are discussed.  The problem was, the red and white outputs were already in use.  I disconnected those outputs, and everything worked fine, although doing this disconnected the sound from the main TV (but that's OK since I am generally watching one or the other, not both).  Hooking up the receiving unit was easy, since there were clear yellow/white/red inputs on my office TV.Unlike other reviewers, I am having pretty good luck with the wireless remote.

Also, my wife does not like the transmitting unit sitting on the entertainment unit, whereas I think it's kind of cool, but that is a girl/guy thing I suppose.Overall, giving it four stars.

It is nice to be able to share the cable box/DVR between three different TV's though (one connected directly and the two using this system) ... it's just not as great as I had hoped.  We live in a two story house on a corner lot (no close neighbors to create potential interference) and this is the only 5.8GHz item in the house and, as I'd mentioned, we're not trying to bounce the signal from one floor to the other as they claim can be done.  It gets the job done for the most part but hopefully they continue to improve on the quality and come out with something better in the future.  I debated between three stars or four, I gave it four because it I am happy with the quality/appearance and it's the best option I've found for hooking up a TV in a room without running cable and it allows you to expand the use of your DVR/TIVO/Cable box.

We use it to transmit from the family room to the kitchen.  The TV in the kitchen is literally under the microwave oven, and next to the cordless phone.  Not ONE bit of interferance.  No lines, no hums, no noises, nothing.  It's a crystal clear picture, sound is great too.  Haven't yet taken the time to set up the IR mouse, but as others said, directions on this are scanty.  Will go back through the reviews to figure htis out further.As to aligning the two units (sender / receiver), they aer roughly pointed in the same direction, and that's it.  No fiddling at all, just plug and play from the video feed box.Highly recommend it!", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Like the product, but customer service not so good so am giving a 2.", "Author": "A.

I have to go into the other room and change the TV.  I called the company and I have to send the transmitter, receiver and the IR Mouse back (AT MY COST).  They said they could have it up to 2 weeks.  They will try to repair it and if not, they will replace.  This is all good but I am a bit miffed by the fact that I have to incur the cost of shipping when it is clearly their defect.  And, that I have to go without TV in my bedroom (sad I know) because of their defect.  I wish they were more accomodating but alas they aren't and I am at their mercy.Will update after the unit is fixed.So, I did send it back at my cost and they fixed and it is still working so I am happy with that.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "This device breaks after two years of careful use.

So I contacted Amazon, and they shipped me another (with 1 day shipping).The new one worked like the old one -- so I decided to try some other components with remotes (an Onkyo receiver, a Samsung TV) -- no problem.I contacted the vendor -- and had a nice phone call with them.  But they were puzzled why some Scientific Atlanta boxes worked, and others didn't.  They asked cisco for information, but cisco wasn't forthcoming.  I sympathize with them, but I spent several hours playing with the device.  Cruising the internet, I came across other people who had the same problem.What is maddening is Terk doesn't have a problem.  Amazon refunded part of my purchase price (thanks Amazon -- you were stellar) and I bought a Terk remote control extender which has no problem.The video/audio is great, when I walk close to it with a 5.8G phone, it breaks up a little.  My801.11g connections don't cause interference (but I have to see how 801.11n works).Very mixed feelings -- but I'm happy I have everything working now.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ok for the time", "Author": "L.
