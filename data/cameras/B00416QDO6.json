(You need to take the battery out and stick it into an included charger).- Pictures/Videos are quite grainy/weird when viewed at full resolution, If you shrink it down to perhaps 25% it's not very noticeable.- You'll need to buy an SD card if you want to take more than a few pictures at a time (built-in storage is only 14.5MB!)- Opening/closing the little cover for the USB jack is beyond annoying. Hurts my fingers to open it and then again to try and jam it back in.Other thoughts:It's a decent, budget point-and-shoot. It's ideal for facebook photos, family/outing pictures, that sort of thing. It's not that much better than some higher-end cell phone cameras.

For the price I have been duly impressed!  Shutter speed is great, which was a huge sticking point for me on so many digital cameras in the past.  Even when your subject is in motion, it generally captures a shot without fuzziness.  The colors come out true and in good quality.  Features are about the same as any other digital camera, no surprises that I've found in that department.  Zoom works nicely and even on full zoom I haven't had a problem with pictures coming out fuzzy...I've had a hard time in the past keeping the camera still enough.  All things considered, for the price, this is a really great little camera!", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "ZombieHooker", "ReviewID": "R3QABTJG4MBH1J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera almost a year ago, to capture the birth of my daughter.  The very day I was in the hospital, I went to turn it on and the lens became stuck.  Fortunately I had other people there to take her newborn photos, but I had to wiggle and tap on the lens while turning it on and off to get it unstuck, and function properly.  Since I've owned this camera, it's done this on more than one occasion.I'm quite disappointed in the graininess of the large full-sized images.  I have owned a 6 megapixel Samsung point and shoot that was cheaper and older and even that camera took much clearer, noise-free photos than this piece of garbage.  I do not believe the video is truly 720p.  The videos are also grainy, and do not look sharp, like HD videos should.The battery door is flimsy, and for some reason is now bending outward.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm not a professional photographer but I know what I like", "Author": "ALEXANDER S WON", "ReviewID": "R3PTQDCMNLSY7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had mine since 2011.

I use mine at work for snapping photos in the field and have dropped it a few times and besides a few scratches, it's fine.  Battery door is definitely flimsy and that could be a downfall.  Also, the flash is placed right where I naturally put my finger in the front causing my finger to shadow the flash sometimes so that usually causes me to have to re-shoot.

Everything worked simply.I took it home, spent time clicking and shooting. In bright light, inside the room, with flash, HD, regular etc. and as I saw the outcome on the LCD, I kept reminding to myself, well.. 'you get what you pay for'. and its a nice package.Then I plug this in to the computer, and after transferring the files, I just sat there horrified. Its just disastrous. Very poor resolution. grainy, blurry, noisy images. My 5MP mobile phone shoots better. I madly searched my archives, pulled out a old images I shot using the early digital cameras of about 1 MP, and they look sharp!! Believe me!.Also slowly I became aware of the flimsy SD card cover, the awkward USB plug.. and it dawned on me.. this camera is going straight back where it came from. And yes.. it did.A camera is something we use to create images that we want to store for long time. There is no reason for *Any* camera manufacturer to manufacture a camera that cannot produce decent quality images.Its simply not acceptable to say, \"you get what you paid for\".Even if I were given this camera for free, I still think its a disaster. I will be ruining all my memories with those blurry, noisy, unclear images for posterity. (In fact I bought this as a gift for someone, and decided its not worth even if the person gets it for free)I would rather store those beautiful memories in my head (however dull they might become) than in this contraption, Casio is bold enough to call a camera.After a bit of searching I just figured that they are painting some cartoon characters on the body now and selling it to kids.
