{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice camera, easy functions, and very portable", "Author": "BayGadget Gal", "ReviewID": "R1NQDAL2HQKUZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera recently because I couldn't take my Canon T1i on a trip (too big). I used a friend's 20x optical zoom Canon Powershot and then looked for something comparable. The 30x optical zoom is impressive. The camera is light and fits in my purse. I was able to shoot from greater distances with very nice quality. The camera doesn't come with any detailed operational instructions and I haven't been able to make the sound playback through the camera on video recordings. Sound does play fine once transferred to my computer. There is a downloadable manual I have yet to find. Video quality was good even in low light. Being able to zoom during video recording is an added plus. The flash must be raised manually which is very different (and a bit inconvenient on auto mode) from previous DSLR or point and shoot cameras I've owned. The fish eye setting is a fun effect. Turning the dial to change settings allows for mode display on the screen. Very helpful. Mode settings are easy to access and manage. Manual settings can be altered easily so far (still figuring out some navigation). Easy to start recording video. NOTE: BATTERY DRAINS VERY FAST. Have a spare or two if you're shooting and don't have access or time to charge batteries. I have two and plan to buy a third even though it's an added expense. All in all, well worth the purchase so far.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price...good for budding photographers.", "Author": "Smittyncrew", "ReviewID": "R36T5LALTTIHCA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this unit for my 13 year old daughter who was showing interest in photography.  The ability to shoot in manual mode combined with the intro-level tripod, and the smaller camera body size, made it ideal for her.  Using the 2-second delay, she can get good steady low light or night shots using a longer exposure.  The light meter works great when doing this.  Just dial the shutter speed until the meter on the lcd is in the middle, hit the shutter button, and get your hands off the camera within the 2 second delay that you can set.  Great results.  On the tripod, of coarse.  As far as automatic point and shoot with flash, the results were very good as well.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as good as I hoped for.", "Author": "TundraMac", "ReviewID": "RWCWAUDL317SD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace an aging Kodak. The price and the style of camera were what drew me to this camera.  My old 5mp camera (built like this camera) was showing it's age by being slow to focus in auto and sometimes not flashing when required. I suspect the electronic controls in my Kodak are starting to fail. All of the Reviews I read said the 16mp Cannon Powershot SX500is would take great pictures and it came with a 30X zoom. Well, maybe taking pictures at family gatherings was not what everyone else did with their camera. I took well over 100-shots at multi-gatherings just after the new year and I did not have a single shot I thought was worth posting on facebook, Let alone sending to get printed. I have friends of friends on facebook who post that I take great pictures with my old Kodak. The photos taken with my new Canon were all grainy or over-exposed. I finally found that if I partly covered the flash with my finger, I would get enough light to take and not so little as to be under-exposed. But I had not mastered the way to do it and keep my eyes on the prize at the same time. Yet it was still for them to be grainy looking. The pictures looked as though I was shooting with a 2.5mp camera. Maybe it was just this camera and not all of the Powershot SX500is's out there. The package of items that came with this camera was great and I could put everything but the full size tripod in the case. The extra battery was not a Canon product but it did work,Now I know there are ways to adjust everything on this camera. And I would have done that, but the LED screen also had a fault.  Vertical streaks that take up about 30% of the screen would come and go depending on what was in the view finder.  Blue clothing or bright room lighting would cause it to act up. If it was acting up from the beginning after a few weeks I just knew it would completely fail either after I could not return it or after the warranty ended.  I had another 2-week before returning was not going to be a choice with Amazon.  My wife and I shoot a lot of my pictures in auto-mode and I need a camera to simply take the shot.  I need it to be a quality piece of equipment and just produce good pictures.I returned the whole package after about 2-weeks and so far the process has gone fine. I am due to get my refund any time. Amazon even paid for the return of this camera kit. It looks like the only thing it will cost me is the shipping promotion. I guess if you get the \"free super saver shipping\" on your Amazon purchase, you have to pay back the shipping fee if the item is returned. My refund was reduced $8.25 to repay them for the free shipping.

I gave it to her a few days before Christmas so she could use it when the grandkids were here to open their gifts. It went great!  She's still learning some of the details of the camera but has the overall function down. And with all the accessories that came with it for the price, I was very pleased!!!!

This is an excellent value for what you get. The only thing the camera lacks is the panoramic option. Everything else is solid. Picture quality is superb. Easy to to set up and go. I use this camera to take pictures of houses for listings. It's not an expensive DSLR. But, it will give you a lot of the features that the more expensive cameras have. Also, The 16MP is overrated because it's just a marketing ploy. I've used the comparable Fuji, Nikon and Olympus. This Canon outperforms them all.

And the purchase helped me solve another trouble I encountered with my memory card from another camera. In fact, the card reader offered in this package let me see my photos in my computer.
