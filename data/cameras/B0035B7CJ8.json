My initial browsing for products that would fit this bill came up with this DVR.  I wish I had kept looking.The interface is typical for bargain products and is challenging but not impossible to navigate and set up.The huge failure is that it can only be browsed via IE but additionally, I couldn't get it to work with Windows 7.  I'd like it to work with OS X as well but could have made it work for my application with just Windows 7.It may be a fine solution for a DVR that sit's in an office with a direct attached monitor but for remote applications, this is about the worst product I could imagine.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$606.18", "Features": "SWANN SECURITY SYS RECORDER WITH INTERNET VIEWING", "Name": "DVR4-2500 Video Surveillance System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31zrmbnikeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035B7CJ8"}}
