{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon Coolpix", "Author": "Kellydoug", "ReviewID": "R5GL0NWRUJQ0H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We have been satisfied with the Nikon Coolpix L21.  It performs as expected for the price. We are also in the market for an SLR which would be a nice companion to this camera. This is a good, \"take anywhere\" kind of camera that's easy to use and takes decent pictures. Sometimes there is a slight delay between pushing the snap button and when it takes the picture (focusing??) which makes capturing a spontaneous moment difficult.  All in all, good camera.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Community Yoga", "ReviewID": "R1D2BAMT9U6XHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the camera, pictures are high quality but this uses batteries like eating candy.

Nelson", "ReviewID": "R2KWYVYJP2S6S8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice little camera.  Rapid shutter response, excellent low light picture quality.  Small enough to fit in your pocket and have handy when you need it.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Middle of the road camera", "Author": "S. G. \"s.g.\"", "ReviewID": "R2SGJHBU5R8BXY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take new pictures for our website. I found that even on the highest setting the pictures were remarkably grainy even though the file sizes were huge. The camera seems to go through batteries very quickly. I did find it easy to learn how to use. I don't know if I was expecting too much from this camera, but I definitely did not think it was worth buying. I ended up buying the Nikon P7000 which was much better for my needs. I'm not sure why somebody would buy this camera as it seems to take pictures much on par with many phone cameras now available.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty good for the price", "Author": "Jimbo", "ReviewID": "RGYPYJA4YD9JC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a \"cheap\" digital camera as a present for a beginner that knows noting about photography.  This Nikon fit the bill for decent build quality (hopefully; time will tell), ok picture quality, and a low price as digital cameras go.  If you're are looking for something to grow into as your camera skills advance, I'd recommend spending a few hundred $ and getting something with manual controls.  This camera is just a basic full auto point and shoot, but the picture quality is pretty good by non-enthusiast standards I think.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for photos of the kids", "Author": "Eric Bucholtz", "ReviewID": "ROD4BFSW241C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Made a great gift for my folks replaced a broken Coolpix from 2005. Easy to use camera for my Mom & Dad to keep handy while watching the grandkids. Easy to use right out of the box, has on-screen tips & help describing different modes. Easy to figure out without shuffling through manuals. AA batteries versatile power source to change out in a hurry without expensive replacement batteries.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does the job", "Author": "Duane Sparks \"Duane\"", "ReviewID": "R225D4J1KFTQM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not being a camera expert, I wanted a camera to give to a family member who needed it for strictly family photos.  The reviews on the Nikon were good enough that I felt this would be a good choice without spending hundreds of dollars.  They love the camera and it takes superb photos.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent camera for price", "Author": "hkicken", "ReviewID": "R3JATFNBX8D0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last year for around $100.  I have had no problems with it, everything functions as intended.  It doesn't have a lot of features, but if you just want a reliable camera to take decent pictures in any environment, this works.  The video is not bad either as long as your not expecting a camcorder.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera, Watch out for Seller.", "Author": "Linda Pennot", "ReviewID": "RLUXNN18312O6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought camera elsewhere because the description by this seller is incorrect. Whether on purpose or accident the description needs to be correct because they say camera does things that only much more expensive models do. They seem to be new but need to get their act together. If I hadn't read Consumer Reports and knew its capabilities I would have purchased from them and then been VERY disappointed upon receipt. Buy the camera....somewhere, and let this be a heads up to the seller.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003MH65F2"}}
