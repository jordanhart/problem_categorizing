{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good step-up camera between ultra-compact and DSLR", "Author": "D. M. CASSTEVENS", "ReviewID": "R2Y6UYHJNH3XPL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me say that while I am not a professinal photographer, I do earn some money from photographing weddings and other events for friends and acquaintences, and consider myself to be an advanced user and photography enthusiast. I shoot primarily with Canon DSLRs and was looking for a compact camera to supplement my current photography equipment.  The Canon PowerShot XS150 IS is a very nice compliment to my gear and overall, I am pleased with it.Canon has produced a very good alternative for the compact camera market in its PowerShot XS150 IS platform.  The camera boasts a 14MP picture size with 12x optical zoom capability and the camera delivers.  The XS150 IS is a little larger and heavier than most compact cameras but is of quality construction and durable.  The case is molded plastic and has a very ergonomic design with specific places to rest your fingers and thumb for one-hand operation. All the controls can be operated with the right hand while holding the camera.The picture quality is very good.  Canon's processor provides vivid colors and impressive clarity for a compact design. The large viewing screen is impressive and easy to see, even in bright sunlight. The controls are easy to use and placed such that they won't be accidentally changed.  The controls in the on-screen menu are easy to use and, if you're familiar with Canon's menu system, you'll be able to start shooting right away.  Those that aren't familiar with Canon should read the manual, but even then, the menu selections and control layout are very intuitive and easy to use.The camera provides a lot of special shooting features that can be used not only for still photography, but also for the video recording. There's an \"easy shooting\" mode for those that want to pick up the camera and start shooting right away, allowing the camera to make all the decisions about ISO, white balance, focus, etc. There are scene and filter shooting modes that allow the photographer to select a style for their photos (monochrome, color accent, color replacement, miniature mode, macro, smile and face detection, beach and snow scenes, fireworks, etc.). For those that want more control over their photography, the camera does offer shooting modes in Manual, Program, Aperture and Shutter Priority.The movie feature works well and provides decent HD video that can be copied directly from the SD card to your computer. The movie feature is a nice function, but keep in mind that this camera is not a movie camera, so don't expect Hollywood quality from it, but it's nice enough to document short events for display on HD TVs and the web.  The stereo sound for the movie function is quite good as well, but the microphones will pick up the sound of the zoom lens motor whirring if you use the zoom feature while shooting video.  The lens motor sound can probably be minimized or eliminated in some video or sound editing programs such as Adobe Premier, DVD Studio Pro, or Soundbooth, etc.The flash is a little different for this camera.  It's centered over the telescoping lens but is manually activated (you have to lift the flash open with your finger) to turn on the auto-flash feature.  While this may seem like an annoyance at first, it's actually not a bad feature, just different; and it prevents that annoying \"pop-up\" of the flash when you really don't want flash but the camera's sensors require it.The XS150 IS is a little larger and heavier than most other compact cameras but is still very portable.  The weight and size are detemined mostly by the fact that the camera uses two AA batteries, and the size of the lens for this camera. Still it's a small camera for what it can do and will easily fit into a cargo pocket or purse, or in a case that can be worn on a belt or attached to a backpack.The only real complaint I have about the camera is the battery life with alkaline AA batteries (this is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).  While it's nice to have a camera that accepts a common battery type (AA) that can be purchased almost anywhere in the world, I would recommend getting the rechargeable NiMH AA batteries because the battery life for alkiline AA batteries seems to be a little short, especially if you're going to shoot video.Overall, this is a great compact camera and it will meet most user's needs especially if they are looking for a camera that provides a lot of shooting features in a small package with HD video and is easy to learn to use. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera but a little bulky.", "Author": "MrBios \"PaulC\"", "ReviewID": "R2GCTHZBT34KL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: 04-19-2014Still going strong.  I use it mostly for technical pictures of repairs.  I'm working on a series for a carburetor clean and rebuild.  I'm starting to use the video feature a lot.  Sometimes in scenes with a lot of action there will be a pause in the video like it could keep up.  Not sure why this happens.  Also, I shoot everything at standard not high definition. I dropped the camera a couple of times on to concrete but it is still working and didn't crack.I updated the review.  I have been using this camera for around 6 months.PROS: Great control over the flash.  If you don't want it then leave it down.  If you do want it then just lift the flash with your finger.  Quality is good (but not great).Speed - camera is fast between pictures, fast to start up, etc.  I like snappy \"real time\" menus and zooming etc.Focus - very very clear.  I used macro mode to take pictures of business cards and I can zoom in and see the hairs of the paper.  Very impressive, very important to me.  Took a picture of a letter on the wall 5 feet away with zoom.  I could review and zoom in and and read very fine print ~ 5pt type font!Low light - very good even without the flash.Screen: large, good quality - it is NOT a touch screen but I think it is much more durable than a touch and you don't need the touch as the controls are easy to use.Manual options: good manual options.Video: very good quality, you CAN zoom while filming. File size was too big for my taste in HD so I reduced the quality to normal.  Sound is so-so / average but perfectly acceptable.CONS:Update: 03-23-2012By far the lens is bulky even when closed.  This is the most serious drawback to this camera IF you intend to carry the camera in the front pocket of your pants or shirt.  I find myself using my cell phone camera because of the bulk and discomfort of keeping this point and shoot camera in my pocket.  It would be nice if the flash had more power and height when extended.Power button:  sometimes the lens has opened in my pocket (or attempted to) because the button was pressed.  Th button should have been smaller and / or harder to push to prevent this.Flash - at night when I open the flash I have seen the message flash is charging which takes a few seconds.  This delays the picture.  Wish it was a bit faster.The overall camera is kind of large to be a \"pocket camera\".  However, the lens is good quality and good in low light and has lots of zoom so this is a trade-off.  I would like it if the body was rubberized.  The hard plastic is slippery.Complexity of the manual settings.  I guess having more features or adjustments brings on this evil.  I'm getting better but sometimes I stumble or fumble to set the aperture or white balance etc.  I'm not sure how this could be simplified without adding more buttons and cluttering things up.What to buy: buy this camera or the Nikon ??? model that costs about $200.  The Nikon is a little smaller and has a rubberized finish but the lens on this camera is probably better due to size.Kill the Paper Monster:I have all sorts of little notes, business cards etc.  I use this camera in macro (close up) mode with a table lamp and no flash to take a picture and then throw the paper out to go paperless.  Then I transfer these digital records to the computer and label and organize the pictures - Business cards, Letters etc so I can search for it later.  Manuals - watch, tool, instructions for a windshield for my scooter - will probably never need them but if I do it is in the computer in the \"manuals\" folder.  Serial numbers - same deal.  It is much easier to search for \"furnace\" or \"water pump\" \"thermostat\" (a model of wireless router) and find the instructions then try to figure out where you put the manual when you bought it 6 years ago.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice camera for someone wanting a little more than a point and shoot.", "Author": "wagsandpaws", "ReviewID": "R3G0RQE4TZEXWM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace the Canon Powershot SX130 that my daughter took to school with her.  The only thing I was initially disappointed in with the purchase was that a memory card did not come with it (note to self; read the fine print!  Other than that, I like that this camera gives you options/settings to use for different types of photo opportunities.  I have taken some very nice quality photos of pets (horses, dogs, cats) as well as trip photos and am pleased with the clarity of the photos and the fact that, if the settings are right, the photos can be printed in large sizes.  I took a photo up close of a feathered tulip; the photo was even more striking when I had it printed in an 11 x 14 size - it won first place in its division at state fair).I'm not as pleased with the video quality on this camera as I was on a previous Sony point and shoot camera I had.  The pro is that you can zoom in and out while videotaping (I couldn't do that on other camera).  The con is that the image is not as clear as I would like.It takes a while to learn all the settings on the camera, especially for a novice like myself; but I like the options and the fact that it is small enough to take anywhere.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best AA battery field use point-and-shoot available anywhere.", "Author": "John Sturgeon", "ReviewID": "R3BTWNRL5BGPIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new Canon SX 150 camera should probably be subtitled, \"Possibly The Best All-Around, Point-And-Shoot, Off-Road-Adventure Camera - Affordable - for the Average Person Today.\"I recently bought this camera, the SX 150 HS, and I also have owned/used the earlier models in this same line for several years now - the SX 110, SX 120, and SX 130 - so I have several years experience with it, all of it very positive.  Yes, it runs on AA batteries, but that is the GOOD NEWS!  If you don't like that, then buy one of the 100 other cameras available that don't use them. Use some form of proprietary lithium-ion battery instead which will set you back $25 to $75 apiece for each spare battery, and it will not even last two functioning years. You will also need several of those batteries for any extended trip, and when you buy your next camera they won't fit it, so you can then just throw away that extra $100 to $200 in useless, expensive, non-interchangeable batteries.Now if you are an average person who doesn't HAVE an extra $100 to $200 to throw away every couple of years on proprietary batteries that only fit one camera, then please read on.This is the LAST REMAINING, top quality, 2-AA battery, point-and-shoot camera left on the market, people.  There are some very good economical reasons to PREFER that choice.  Anywhere you travel, you can ALWAYS buy - or borrow - AA batteries to keep it going.  The AA batteries are about as universal an item as exists on the planet, so you can still keep shooting this camera almost anywhere you go.  But you absolutely should use rechargeable AAs whenever you can to save money - a LOT of money. And they last much longer on each charge. I get about 350 large JPEG photos per charged set, and since I sometimes shoot a lot of photos in one place, I always carry at least two pairs of backup batteries to swap out.&&&&&&&UPDATE EDIT:  In Dec. 2011, I bought my first few sets of Sanyo eneloop AA rechargeable batteries.  Since then I have used them very, very successfully in this camera. On a recent field trip to the local mountains near Monterey, CA, I set out with a fully-charged pair of eneloop AA batteries in the SX150, and I carried a backup pair of eneloop AAs just in case.  I did a full day of shooting with 425 full-sized JPEGs and 8 minutes of HD video, and I used a lot of zoom and frequently turned the camera off and on too. That is a LOT of battery use for one set of AA batteries. The batteries finally ran out early the next day as I was testing some of the features on the camera. It is my understanding that it costs less than 1 cent apiece in household current to recharge them each time, and that they are guaranteed to recharge at least 1500 times. And they are also supposed to hold about 70% of their full charge even after three years just sitting on a shelf! (Unlike the older style of rechargeable AA batteries that lost their charge fairly quickly.) Since they last at least 2 to 3 times as long as standard alkaline batteries on each charge, that would represent a total savings of at least $1500 (fifteen hundred dollars) over the cost of buying 3000 alkaline batteries on sale at only 50 cents apiece FOR EACH PAIR OF AA ENELOOP BATTERIES that you would use on any other household devices in your own home.  Don't think of them as just being for use in a camera.  They work in everything requiring AA batteries.  Flashlights, computer mice, remotes (they make them in AAA too), children's toys, shop tools, wall clocks or anything else you might use them for in your home. They sell for about $20 on Amazon for an 8-pack of them.  That represents a savings of about $6000 over the 1500 cycle lifetime of each 8-pack of eneloop batteries you buy and use instead of regular alkaline batteries. Do the math yourself and you will be astounded by how many thousands of dollars they can save you around your home over a period of 5, 10 or even 20 years.BTW - As a special note.  The \"low battery\" light comes on in the SX150 camera long before the batteries are actually dead.  That is because the SX150 is calibrated for 1.5 volt alkaline AA batteries.  The Sanyo eneloop AA rechargeable batteries only recharge to about 1.2 volts or 1.3 volts at most.  The camera \"thinks\" they are low because it looks for a low voltage to decide that. Some cameras do have a menu item to change the battery check away from alkaline batteries (at 1.5 volts) to rechargeable batteries (at 1.2 or 1.3 volts), but I don't think the SX150 gives you that option. Just keep using them until they actually do run out and you will be surprised at how long they really do last.Best wishes to all,  - John&&&&&&&&Regular alkaline batteries don't last long, and are obviously WAY too expensive to use in any AA battery camera for more than very occasional shooting. That is printed right in the instruction manual.  Honestly, you are just supposed to know that fact ahead of time.You only use alkaline batteries in emergencies when you simply run out of the extra recharged ones you are carrying with you and you find yourself in a tight spot. Later on when you buy your next camera, you can transfer those same AA batteries to it without spending a dime buying a single new, proprietary lithium-ion battery in the whole process. Rechargeable AA batteries are unbelievably cheaper in the long run - and much better for the environment - if you add up all of the costs and waste involved in going through one new set of proprietary lithium-ion batteries after another as the years go by.That is probably this camera's best, preferred, long-term feature, but by no means its only good feature. It is also very light weight and compact.  It will not fit in your shirt pocket, but it is not supposed to.  Your shirt pocket is where your cell phone goes with its own built-in camera. The slightly larger and heavier (and much better image quality) Canon SX 130 or SX 150 will fit easily into your coat pocket, travel bag, or purse, which is where it belongs, anyway.Should you buy the new SX 150 if you already have an SX 130? That depends on you, but especially on whether you want a backup camera with you when you go out on a photo shoot.  On my most recent trip I took my older SX 120 camera with me as a backup. I don't want to be out in the wilderness with no backup camera, and the best backup camera is the one closest to my current camera as possible. On my next trip I will take my SX 150 and my SX 130 will become my new backup camera.Now I will sell my older SX 120, which still works fine after three years, to somebody else who understands the reliable and cost-effective value of having a good 2-AA point-and-shoot camera. That has been my experience with the whole Canon SX 100+ Power Shot line over the last several years now, and it has all been very positive. I hope this review may help others who may not have seen some of this economical, common sense information discussed in this way before.  Best wishes and good photo results to all.UPDATE:  There is at least one other important option with the SX 150 that I have not really described here in my original post, but since it is a generally affordable one it deserves some serious consideration.  It is the option my wife and I personally chose and have used with wonderful success together through the SX120, SX130 and now the SX150 model cameras. You can buy 2 - Canon SX150s, for the price of 1 - Canon SX40.  (We do actually own an SX40, too, but we have found we rarely use it except for super-long 35X telephoto shots. It is just too cumbersome for us to carry around with us most of the time in it's separate camera bag.) My wife carries one SX150 with her, I carry the other. (She chose a black one, I wanted a red one!)  At least one of us ALWAYS has at least one of those two SX150 cameras with us at all times.  Together we get more good shots that way and under a wider variety of circumstances than either of us would separately. And we teach each other new techniques with the camera.  If I figure out a new manual setting, I teach it to her.  She may discover a new camera angle that had not occurred to me to try. We have found that when we shoot the very same field trip together we shoot different things because we zero in on different things. We complement each other's photography, and that has been an even more fulfilling experience for us personally to share together.Again best wishes,  John", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Underrated!", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "RU9EAHQW0DPK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in October of 2011 after my old point-and-shoot finally kicked the bucket. I needed something that was a step up from a P&S;, but not too big. I chose this, and I'm glad I did. I love this camera. I've taken over 1000 photos and 25 videos so far, and I haven't encountered any serious issues yet.Overall, the camera body feels nice. It's a little larger than the smaller point-and-shoot cameras, so it wont really fit well in your pocket like other little point-and-shoots (fits in coat pockets though). It's also a little heavy, but I actually like that because it feels like I'm holding a real camera. I'm a 5'11\" slim male, and this fits perfectly in my right hand. It's not rubberized at all, but there are grooves on the front and back of the camera that allow for a nice firm grip, and it comes with a little cord to go around your wrist. I'm not worried about dropping this thing at all. The buttons are large and easy to press. Also, Canon seems to be known for user-friendly menus within the camera. It took me 2 seconds to figure out this menu system.These claims of 20 or 30 photos on a new pair of batteries is ridiculous! Don't bother using the cheapo alkaline batteries that come with it, just save them for your TV remote or something. When I bought this camera, I bought two pairs of rechargeable Energizers to go with it. I don't use those batteries for anything but this camera, and I always stick them in the charger when I get home after using the camera, so I have two fresh pairs when I leave the house the next day. Like I said, I've taken a bunch of photos with this, and I've only had to change out the batteries a few times along the way. I haven't actually kept track to see exactly how many photos I can take on one set of batteries, so don't ask me for a specific number. I just know one day I took 50 photos and 20 minutes of video without killing the batteries. Another day, I took 70 photos where each photo was a 15 second exposure on a 2-second timer, so it probably took a little more juice for each photo than a regular snapshot. The camera was also on for at least two hours straight that day, and the batteries didn't actually die... The days where the batteries do die is when I'm out with my friends taking many photos, lengthy videos, constantly browsing through menus to adjust settings, etc... Really though, I don't have a problem with battery life. Note: Right when I got this camera, I adjusted any power saving options I could find so that I could make my batteries last as long as possible. Turning down the LCD brightness and whatnot is something I do with all of my electronics. I suggest you do the same.The video mode is nice. It records 1280x720, very nice quality video. The sound is OK. You can zoom in and out while recording, though you can hear the motor moving a little bit. The only time you wont hear it is when taking video where there is loud music or other noise. It also zooms in and out fairly slowly. This may be a problem if you plan on using this mainly for video. If that's your plan, go get yourself an actual camcorder. Your son's baseball game really deserves better than this. I use this video mode for little moments with friends that I want to upload to Facebook/Youtube, and maybe just the grand finale of a fireworks show (but certainly not the whole show).The colors and sharpness are great. It focuses well and generally chooses the correct settings. It also offers various manual controls, which are pretty easy to use. I'm able to play around with shutter speed, aperture, ISO, white balance, and several creative filters. Though I shot in auto mode all the time when I first got this camera, I usually find myself flipping it into manual mode quite often these days. Occasionally, the automatic settings actually chose better settings than I do, but there are other times where the camera just isn't seeing exactly what I'm seeing, and these manual controls allow me to fix this and capture exactly what it is that my eyes see. I personally don't let the ISO go past 400 because photos do come out quite grainy in the high ISO settings. I compensate with the widest aperture possible and a longer shutter speed. Because of these manual controls, this camera actually does very well in low-light situations, assuming you have at least somewhat steady hands. Otherwise, there's a nice flash on top of the camera you can just pop up when you feel it's necessary.Also, I feel as though it is very important to point out that this camera, like many others, does NOT come with a memory card. I don't understand why people are complaining about that. It's NORMAL for cameras to not come with a memory card. I got a SanDisk 16GB SDHC card to go with my camera, which is really more than enough (I could even use this card in an SLR). I also decided to get an SDHC card reader so that I wouldn't have to plug a cord into my camera and turn it on every time I want to pull my photos off it. It's just much quicker and easier that way. Note: The memory card is located in the same compartment as the batteries on the bottom of the camera, so hold it upside down when sliding the cover open so the batteries don't fall out.I'm really not sure what else to say. This is a great camera that I feel is a bit underrated. 5 Stars all the way from me. This is my first ever review, so I hope I made sense :)", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great pictures awesome video/sound", "Author": "K. Eckley", "ReviewID": "R36KQ0MX3U629E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my Canon powershot A710IS. The SX150IS is a nice step up. It does a wonderful job in low light situations. The HD video is superb in low light situations as well. I'm especially happy with the recording mics on this camera. I use the video record option while at very loud karaoke bars. The sound is great, never over modulated.There are too many features to list here about this camera. Included is the owner's manual on cd.  I wish there was  a printed copy so that I can read it in a more comfortable position. Don't care to sit at the computer or waste ink printing out the whole thing. For those of you who already own it, I found a neat little extra. while the camera is in picture taking mode, hold the function button in for about a minute. The whole display becomes a digital clock. By rotating the wheel around the func button you can change the colors of the clock. Found that to be pretty neat. Not sure if it's in the owner's manual or not, but thought it was pretty neat to come across.The battery life is great. Be sure to use high MAH rated batteries. At least 2000 or more. If you want some long lasting superb battery performance, look into getting some eneloop rechargeables. They're put out by Sanyo and they're a very, very good battery. Check the reviews on them.If I had to choose anything negative about this camera it would probably be the flash operation. Most cameras in this class have a flash that will pop up automatically in the auto mode when required. This one does not do it automatically. It will let you know to pop the flash up manually yourself if needed but it doesn't do it automatically. That can be a good thing though too. This way you can override the flash option. It will still take the picture but just without the flash.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not perfect but pretty good", "Author": "ErickWHS", "ReviewID": "R1IQWXFI6OFRXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned a previous version of the PowerShot. When I upgraded, there was no other choice for me.The picture quality is very good. I take a lot of pictures at athletic events and this camera does a fairly nice job with even high speed events - somebody charging down the court for instance. With my old PowerShot I probably had 1 in 5 I deleted, which I expected. I didn't pay for a multi-hundred dollar camera with the ability to zoom in on the flea on my dogs back then and I didn't this time either. Now, I probably get 1 bad picture in 25 as far as action shots. No gripes. Regular posed photos, excellent. Although, I will say the flash sometimes has a mind of its own which can be frustrating. The zoom is excellent, much better then the old line in terms of magnification capability and still taking a good shot.Download/transfer was made even more simple. Before I would have had to have the Canon interface installed on my PC, now it just transfers automatically. Hooray! I'd like to believe that's why this camera is a bit bigger as they added capability.And as I see many people have been talking about batteries, I have had no such problems. Battery life is, with my rechargeables, as good as it was before. 100-125 shots minimum.What I will tell you, is so obvious, do your homework! If you want to see the flea circus from 100 yards, then buy a camera that can do that. Also, find the battery solution that works for you. I like being able to slide two double A's in.

Just because the camera says raise the flash does not mean it is a command you must follow. I have been taking photos since 1967 when I was in the Marine Corps. I would have given anything to have this camera then.  If you go to manual and set the shutter speed and aperture as well as iso you do not need a flash in many indoor situations. I used it once to try it out and it was as good as any other plus it is built in and does not require a hot shoe set up.  Try being a little more creative in what you do before you enter a shooting situation and you will have better results. I had a Rebel and returned it in favor of the sx150 primarily because of the higher pixel count on the sx150. 14.1 compared to 10 or 12 for the rebel. The battery is another factor. Use rechargeables and carry a cheap pack of alkaline AA's for extras. Why deal with a battery that costs as much as 50% of the camera price when you can spend a few cents. Concerning camera noise on video, shoot in discrete mode and it almost totally disappears. Also keep your fingers off of the microphone for better sound,(all those little holes on the top left of the camera). Many of the reviews I read seemed to be from those who refuse to read manuals and test the features. The camera I have takes spectacular pictures in all kinds of situations.  I was skeptical of it's size and not being able to change lenses but after using it one day realized it was the best of both worlds. If you are a true professional photographer then spend a few grand on a Leica or some such camera and be happy. I paid $150.00 for a camera that I could not touch for less than a few thousand not that long ago. For taking photos the best option is to go to manual and choose the shutter speed and iso and let the camera do the rest in easy mode. voila! One of the biggest plus features is the included software. Edit your photos and unless you're Gomer Pyle I don't see what the malfunction is sweetheart. The case that is sent with camera is a real stinker and much too small for the good fit it should have. Buy a real case. Oh yeah, if you're silly enough to carry a camera in a shirt pocket you should just buy a throw away single use and get on with it.

Before this camera I had another canon camera, the Powershot A610, which was a great camera but after so many years with it, I wanted a little more without having to spend more than 200 dollars.The tryout: I have been trying the SX150is under different conditions: Under lots of sunlight, at night, taking pictures from my car, with my dogs, cloudy days and so far the pictures have been amazing. I haven't had any problems using the 3 inch screen under very sunny days. The zoom of this camera is lots of fun, especially on video mode, I was in a race track the other day and it was cool to use it to not miss any part of the action, even when the cars were far away on the other side of the track. Yes, it's true that it is a little bulky, you might not be able to slide it inside your jeans pockets but, just like somebody wrote, that's where your cellphone should go, not your camera. It's easy to use with just one hand while your other hand has a soda or a beer, so no need to worry that you will miss enjoying the food and drinks at the BBQ because you decided to take pictures.The Flash: Before getting the camera I was kinda worried about it, since you gotta be pulling it up if you want to use it. The truth is that once I got my camera and started taking pictures I didn't feel that was a problem, the camera lets you know if you need flash, although there are sooo many ways to take great pictures with this camera without even thinking of using the flash. Taking pictures at night is awesome, I haven't seen cameras on this price range taking pictures in low light with the quality that this camera gives you. The flash does take a little bit to load, but it is not a big problem for me, it's not like you have to sit or make people hold a smile for  30 seconds so that you can take a picture with flash.I have read some complaints about battery issues but, that shouldn't be a problem if you buy good rechargeable batteries. I got for this camera four (4) 3100 mAh rechargeable batteries and it's a whole big difference when you compare them with what alkaline batteries or lithium batteries can give you. The fun part is that, in case your rechargeable batteries run dry, you can always get some AA anywhere you are and keep having fun with your camera until you can recharge them again, so my advice is that if you have this camera and you don't want to be one of those people giving crappy scores to this camera just because they are too hard headed to keep feeding this camera with normal batteries, spend a little over 10 dollars in batteries as the ones I got, I spent a whole afternoon taking pictures and videos with these batteries without having to recharge them.To make this short, if you want the best camera that money can buy for less than 200 dollars, this is it. No other camera will give you the quality or the features that this one has. I'm very happy with what this camera offers, it has been way more than what I expected. You won't regret it and remember: BUY GOOD RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!! It's just silly to keep seeing people writing complaints about using this camera with normal batteries of little capacity.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Easy camera and great videocamera features", "Author": "Roberto Carlos \"Roberto Carlos\"", "ReviewID": "RS8ES8U368A20", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own a previous Canon PowerShot S5 IS (8M, I bought back at 2008) and found it to be a great camera, on the prosumer side. The zoom features were very good, and too late I found out that the when taking video, the quality was very good, but for todays technology is regular.Based on the Canon personal reference and because the SX150 had a great deal at the local Costco, I decided to buy it. The main reason was that I wanted to take advantage of it size compared to my previous canon, and also because the video is a 720p HD, better than the420 of my previous camera. I was aware the SX150 was not a direct replacement, it was more on the \"pocket camera\" side than on the \"prosumer camera\" side.Pros: The pictures taken with the camera are very good. Very nice detail, simple to use, smaller if compared with my previous camera (still qualify as pocket camera). It has some very cool features as to filter the image to just the color you want, i.e. if you select green, it will provide a picture/video on gray tones and will let the green objects to be unfiltered. The video is not full HD, it is 720p, but for my Mac, it is enough for great home video edition. Simple to use. The anti shaking filter is really awesome, it will provide really nice stand video when filming. I actually prefer this video quality than other HD camcorders. I also bought a 16GB memory, so I have almost 2hrs of video, plus all the pictures I want. Unless you are a professional that shoots the straigth 2 hrs, 16GB will be more than enough for your family daily activitiesCons: Unlike my previous Canon, the display cannot be twisted, turned off, moved on angle (tilted), and if you have used this features, you really missed it. The lens is slightly smaller, but does not really impact the quality. An small spec somehow go inside the camera lens, and even though this is not affecting the pictures yet, I found it to be really discomforting (my previous Canon never got dust inside the lens). It is kind of slower than my previous camera so some time is required to actually shot the object (specially my kids).Some people complain a lot about the battery life, and I was aware of that, so I take an alternative approach. I bought 4 AA rechargeable batteries and an small camera case, and every time I take the camera with me, I have the extra batteries. The camera actually consume a lot of power, and I have found that for a regular 5 hrs of use, the battery needs to be replaced. So far I have not spend the two pairs, so this approach has worked really good.So at the end, if you see the cost-benefit, for a 150USD you get a really nice product, excellent pictures, great video, affordable and a easy to use camera. Is it the best? of course not, but the 150USD are unbeatable for what you get.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Disappointment from Canon !!!", "Author": "Enlightened", "ReviewID": "R28HLTCZEVG8MW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To me, Canon is a very reliable brand name for digital camera.You will have good Image Quality (IQ), descent functionality and best customer care from Canon that's why I purchased this Canon SX150 IS camera.When I unboxed camera, I felt that hey... its sort of chubby version of Point and shoot (P&S;) camera.This camera is indeed VERY BULKY compare to all available camera in P&S-Pocket; size category. Measuring 1.8 x 4.5 x 2.9 inches and heavy too weighting 10.7 ounces. This numbers may not catch your eyes immediately or it looks normal. But you have to look, touch and feel to realize how chubby and heavy this camera is.Also, if you try to look 'Beauty' in this camera, perhaps you won't be able to find it. I means to say design of this camera may or may not catch your eyes. I know it is totally subjective so you have to check it your self. One more thing, by touching camera you may feel some what 'plasticky' material that is cheaply made.This camera failed to catch my interest in Tactile aspect.Next step was testing it and I wanted to test it with indoor and outdoor to check IQ.Lets talk about outdoor performance first.As a typical Canon camera, its perfect for outdoor shooting. What I noticed is, decent IQ at low ISO, sharp picture without any noise (at lowest ISO), rich color, good zoom range (Perfect for travel), fast enough to catch kids and pets moments, balanced exposure and much more that should be in a perfect mid range P&S; camera.One good news for this camera is about its battery life.Yes, it is indeed battery eater camera if you use 'Normal Alkaline' batteries. But if you upgrade batteries with High Capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries (2000 mAh or above), you can take 100s of snaps with almost entire day shooting and hunting with spare pair of batteries.Conclusion so far, it passed day time outdoor shooting, passed battery performance (only if you have high capacity NiMH batteries) and failed tactile aspect of camera.Now some discussion about indoor shooting.I got shocked to see performance of this camera in indoor setup.I knew that this is not 'Fast' camera, but I didn't know that it is 'Very Slow' camera. What does it mean you are unable to catch your kids' and pets' precious moments without having blur image. If you put camera on Auto mode and shoot it with High ISO, you may have blur free images but other side picture will be have full of noise.Either side you will loose. In indoor setting you only get either blurry or noisy images. No matter how cute your kids or pets are, they will always look very ordinary with 'little help of this Canon SX150 camera'.Why we take thousands of pics of out kids or pets? Because we want to 'Freeze' present precious moments for tomorrows remembrance. And I am sure you will not be pleased with IQ of this camera to make moments forever.Did I hear some one saying using flash to eliminate this problem?Well... well... wait till I unveil most unacceptable aspect of this camera.Flash performance of this camera is very worst ever I have seen. Here also you will have 'Loose-Loose situation'. How? Well, if you check IQ of pictures taken with flash on, you will get disappointment. They are not natural looking pictures.Worst part yet to come. And thats its flash to flash time interval. Just look at your kid/pet right now take a mental picture of them and just say 1, 2, 3, ...7 and then again take a mental picture.Did you miss anything that you wanted to take picture of? I bet you missed many moments worth of shooting while you were counting till 7. Why I asked you to count till 7? Well because this camera take exact 6.5 seconds to 'Charge its Flash' before you can use this camera with flash. Don't you think in today's 21st century Jet era when everything is performing very fast (in seconds or milliseconds), waiting for 6-7 seconds to charger flash of your camera seems like living in 19th century? Yes it is.In a nutshell:Pros:Good IQ outdoor shootingAcceptable battery life using NiMH batteriesBig enough suits for large handsCanon interface-easy to operate even to unfamiliar personsD-pad to scroll smoothlyManual control-Aperture, shutter priority and full manual control to play with cameraFun filters to 'Play' with cameraCons:Horrible flash performance - IQ with flash worst, flash charging for 6-7 seconds worst of the worstPoor indoor IQSlowest camera of Mid range P&S; classBulkier, heavier than every other cameraOnly few scenes in scene mode.

My first digital camera was a Canon A430, then a couple of years later I upgraded to a Canon A480. Now I moved away from the A series to this SX because I was looking for a camera that featured a great zoom.I did look elsewhere, but ended up with Canon again. The features on this camera are unbelievable considering its price tag. And the zoom itself is awesome! The optical zoom is flawless and the digital zoom (48X) is pretty good as well. There's nothing quite like it on the market with this price. Price's bound to climb up soon!The only thing people seem to complain about on this camera is battery life. Well, I was aware of that when I bought it so I invested $20 more dollars on the Eneloop rechargeable batteries (with sanyo charger included) and I've had no problems at all. Batteries last just as much as they had lasted with my old Canon cameras.I'm very happy with the camera!", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best AA Battery Camera Out there!!!", "Author": "Ryan Crouse", "ReviewID": "R3KPVTXS535063", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, where to begin! I bought this camera on Dec. 18, 2011 so I have had a lot of time to work with it!To start with, the FIRST thing I would purchase are good batteries - not a typical retail brand such as Duracell or Energizer Rechargeable, as they don't hold up, but a Camera Quality AA! I bought the 4 pack OPTEX 2500 mAh NiMH Rechargeable.The 4 pk is great as when you are out in the field, the spare can be a life saver! I tested the Energizers mAh NiMH Rechargeable first and out in the cold in the middle of winter they were flat dead within about 1 1/2 hours. The OPTEX were strong for about 3+ hours and then after I took about 80+ photos came home, plugged the camera into the TV and then spent roughly 45 minutes viewing them - still no low battery. When the \"low battery\" light does finally come on in the SX150 camera, you still end up with a decent amount of time before the batteries are actually dead.The SECOND thing is a good SD Card. I purchased the \"PATRIOT LX Series\" 16 GB / Class 10 SDHC Card. It's Fast, Reliable and GREAT with the 720p Video Recording!Now onto the CANON POWERSHOT SX150 IS ...I upgraded to this from my Canon Powershot A590 and WOW what a difference! The first thing I did notice between the two is the scrolling wheel on the SX150 made everything feel smooth. The second thing I noticed is that with the A590, using the 'AUTO' setting was pretty much 'Good Enough.' With the SX150 it is NOT, as I found that it generally shot with a higher then necessary ISO (usually 400-800) leading to grainy photos. That meant I had to learn how to use the 'MANUAL' setting. For that reason, I am actually glad as now I have learned a great deal with the Shutter and the Aperture, and whatever else.The 'Special Screen Mode' and 'Creative Filter Mode' in this camera such as the Fisheye effect, Miniature effect, Toy Camera, Poster effect, Color swap, Super vivid are also great additions to the Powershot series!I've been using the SX150 a lot for Outdoor and Animal shots. I've gotten some impressive bird shots that were bright, clean and clear, especially as 80 ISO.VIDEO was the other thing that impressed me a great deal in comparing to the A590. First, it shoots in 720p rather than the standard def which is nice! I compared the two by recording at a Metal Concert and there is basically no comparison! With the A590 the quality was basic and the sound was brutal when the Bass Guitar was being played. The SX150 was smooth, clear and rather still as it seemed not to shake when I was cheering along with the rest of the fans.With this camera, I have now had 10+ photos appear on TV via The Weather Network and have been printed in a couple different Local Papers.I honestly think that once you've mastered this camera, your next one should be a SLR.One other note:A lot of people have been comparing the SX150 to the SX40. A friend of mine has the SX40 and when you look at the quality between the two, they are almost identical! The only big difference I notice is that the SX40 has a 35x Optical Zoom as the SX150 has a 12x Optical Zoom.

Secondly, the camera takes awhile to power up - which annoyed me right off the bat. Once on, the menus are not very intuitive. There is too much scrolling through multiple menus. I imagine that with practice, it would be easy to navigate, but it certainly isn't straight out of the box. Lastly, and most disappointing for me was the flash situation. The flash didn't fire automatically in auto mode. Instead, there is a message on the screen \"Raise the flash\" which prompts you to manually raise the flash cover. So, ok, I thought, just keep the flash up at all times. Unfortunately, after firing the flash takes several seconds to charge. This makes it very difficult and frustrating to take consecutive shots that require a flash. With kids, those moments don't always wait for the flash to be ready.

I've also used it for a few other weekenders and day hikes since then. So this camera has got some good usage under different but average conditions in the last 3 months. I'm satisfied with the quality of the photos.Battery life is fine. I'm not sure what people are complaining about. I just bought several pairs of rechargeable batteries. Even with all the photos I was snapping of my family on the cruise I never noticed myself having to constantly change batteries. Battery usage was not an issue. Double AA batteries was an actually a feature I wanted in a camera since I know I can easily bring along several pairs of rechargeable batteries which can be shared with my other electronics, such as my GPS.Size of camera is a little larger than your average point and shoot, but this was never an issue. On my trips and hikes I had the camera in a belt pouch and it never felt overly bulky or in the way.Interfacing with the camera is easy and logical. Most used features/options are usually one or two button clicks away.I also wanted a camera with features similar to a SLR camera, such as shutter and aperture priority which most point and shoots do not offer.The large 3\" viewing screen is a nice feature to review/show photos and easily read the different options.Value is excellent. There are more than enough features that you'll ever need. The best and most used feature is the powerful zoom. One can get some great effects with the zoom.  I noticed no drop off in quality. However at the higher magnifications you'll need to anchor the camera on a sturdy base.I only noticed two minor drawbacks. The first is the flash recycle time. Like other people have commented, the flash does seem to take an extra second or two to recharge compared to other point and shoots. The second is when taking macro shots with a flash, the lens barrel projects a shadow in the photo - this is minor unless you do this type of photography all the time.This is a great camera for the value.

Thats why I was especially disappointed when they came out with this model and I bought it thinking it would be as good as the rest of them.First of all is the picture quality, which is probably why most people would by this camera and the only reason You should. The picture quality is crisp and clear like i expected a Canon PowerShot series camera should be. However, at least with my SX150, the auto-focus is a pain in the neck. I thought since this is in the middle of a digital and DSLR camera, it would have good auto-focus if they weren't gonna put in manual focus. But I was wrong. It seems the more you zoom in, the lot less clearer your image becomes.In addition to this problem, the camera is also quite delicate and is Not durable. Be warned, if you are looking to invest in a camera with a long life potential in mind, dont go with the SX150. I dropped it only once so far and on a carpeted floor, and somehow the right side of it chipped a little and the camera seems to take a longer time focusing then it did before.One of the worst aspects of this camera is the videoing/recording feature. While it does ok in perfect daylight, its filming quality goes completely downhill in the least bit of darkness that your expected to encounter sometime when you want to record something. Canon, if you're going to make this camera have the ability to shoot in 720p HD, you should spend more time testing and making sure that you got it right.The Last problem I had with this is the battery life. You HAVE to get ultra lithium batteries if you expect to be using the camera for a good portion of a day. otherwise, in like 10-15 minutes of on time, the camera completely shuts downn and it wont turn on again until you put new batteries in it. But if spend the extra $ and use ultra-lithium batteries with it, it does alright.Although it has many problems, it does have a really cool, professional looking design as well as a nifty, well thought at flash and flash feature option(s). the zoom is also fantastic if you dont mind your picture quality getting degraded a bit.Pros:great picture qualitypretty cool designnice manual open/close flash featurereally good zoomintuitive and easy menu and setupCons:bad auto-focusNot durable/long-lastingcould use quite a bit of work in the videoing/recording areahorrible battery life unless you buy the expensive ultra-lithium batteriesI know I spent a lot of this review focusing on the bad, but thats what I really feel the camera deserves.

Features were less important than ease of use and quality output.  She also needed a camera that wasn't too small, and easy to hold.The Canon PowerShot SX150 offered an inexpensive option for her.  Due to failing eyesight, she had no need for an eyepiece option (something I like on my cameras as I've had the LCD screens die...), and she liked the fact that this camera uses AA batteries - readily available to her.The media for this camera (SD or SDHC card - not included) was found to be a big factor in performance.  Upgrading to a Class 10 SDHC card like: Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10E will help.  Avoid cards that are less than Class 10 as it bogs down the camera's shot to shot performance.  The Class 10 SDHC cards will also make the video recording performance of this camera, work well for you.Positives:+ Size is right for those who want a compact digital camera with video capabilities, who have large hands or who don't appreciate 'smaller' electronics.+ Photos taken without the flash, indoors and outdoors using 'AV' are crisp and true to color.+ Lots of creative settings available on the camera and explained on the enclosed manual on CD.+ Zoom works well and stabalizer does its job.+ AA batteries are a nice option for travelers.+ LCD screen is large and clear, with menu easy to navigate.+ Video quality with SDHC card (not included) is excellent.+ 14.1 MP means potentially stunning enlargements.Negatives:- Finding the 'right' combination of settings can take a lot of time.- The manual flash engagement is odd, and the flash itself takes too long to fire.- The camera's manual is on the enclosed CD, but no substantial paper version of any substance ships with the camera.- Macro operation is inconsistent on this camera.- Time/Date won't set and stay set on the camera we received.- Lots of fuzzy shots when the camera is on 'Auto'.- Inconsistent photo clarity on most settings.- Battery hog IF you frequently review your shots after taking them.This camera is a mixed bag of good and bad.  It's not terrible, but it's not fantastic either.While not identical in specs, these are some well rated options you may wish to compare with the Canon PowerShot SX150 for about the same cost to you:  Panasonic DMC-FH25K 16.1MP Digital Camera with 8x Wide Angle Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Black), Nikon COOLPIX S8200 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 14x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Silver), and Canon PowerShot ELPH 510 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full HD Video and Ultra Wide Angle Lens (Black).", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera; battery strength better than indicator; zoom noise & clicks", "Author": "C B", "ReviewID": "R3PBV9KD618LZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Still camera shots are great.  Video is usually good, but if you are filming a performance where there is silence at times (say a play), you can hear the zoom motor and a definite click as it stops and locks.  This does not make for good video as any zooming is underlined and attention is taken away from what you are filming.  I rarely do that kind of filming, but this is a disappointing camera in that aspect.  However, to be fair, I don't notice the zoom noise when taping musical performances or when speaking is pretty much non-stop as with a speech, sermon or lecture.  But zoom motor noise is glaringly there when there is silent or very low volume action going on.Also, battery life doesn't do much better than 30 minutes even with freshly charged batteries.  So, if you want to film a longer event, this is not your camera.  Also, if you carry the camera around and expect to pull it out for events you just happen upon, don't expect more than 4-5 minutes of battery life for video footage.After 8 months of use, I would now give the SX150 a three or four star rating.  It's a good camera, but with real limitations.-----I bought this to replace a Canon A2000 IS.  It doubled the optical zoom, still used AA batteries, and added manual mode and all for only $165.This is a beauty.  I've tested it on people photos, hand held photos of the moon in manual mode, and macro close ups.  It has performed very nicely.  Even the flash has performed well for a little flash. The video footage is well lit and even does reasonably well in a semi-dark room when you zoom in on the subject.The battery indicator is way too sensitive.  At a child's birthday party not long after I had put newly charged batteries in it warned me that the batteries were getting low.  I decided to see how long the batteries would last.  Twenty-one minutes of video and various still shots later the batteries were still going.  Those batteries (NiMH) lasted for another week of relatively light photo taking before finally needing to be recharged.  So, I have learned to disregard the low battery indicator.Though in a pinch the camera can fit in the front pocket of not too tight jeans (though it is visually evident you have something bulgy in your front pocket), I use a Polaroid Studio Series Universal Compact Camera Case (Black) For The Canon, Nikon, Kodak, Sony, Polaroid, Panasonic, Olympus, Pantex, Fuji, Casio, Samsung Digital Camera.  It just barely fits (only one way with the lens end up and fits best with the lens facing the front), but the case is nicely made with a good strap.  In the case it can fit in a purse, briefcase or bookbag easily and is protected.Besides the overly sensitive battery warning indicator, I can't think of anything I don't like about this camera.  This allows me to carry a first class compact camera with me all the time with the great flexibility of a 12x zoom and manual mode and no worries about battery replacement that using standard AA batteries brings.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not so great indoor camera", "Author": "Mickey", "ReviewID": "ROJH1C0RJ4X6Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After using the camera for about 4 months (and about 1000 pictures), I have come to the conclusion that this is not a very good indoor camera, more on this later.I bought this camera as a replacement to my S2-IS, which I have used for 5 or 6 years, but now suffers from the 'black screen of death', i.e. the shutter is stuck closed.  I purchased this camera because it was relatively cheap and came packed with features (i.e. zoom, megapixels, and shooting modes).What I found out is that this camera performs horrible at ISO above 400, the pictures are very 'noisy'.  To top it off, the flash does not throw much light, so it is pretty useless indoors, especially if you plan to take advantage of the 12X zoom.  In other words, you can zoom across the room, but the camera (lens/sensor) is so 'slow', that you just get dark pictures.  Now because the flash went off at full power, you have to wait almost 10 seconds for the camera to be 'ready' again for the next picture.I originally had battery life issues using normal rechargeable batteries (i.e. the ones I had used for my S2-IS that I had lying around the house).  I finally determined that it was probably the batteries at fault, as Canon would not have designed a camera to only last at most 50 shots on a set of batteries.  I went ahead and got some 'Eneloop' batteries ($20 for 10 at C0stc0).  These batteries are amazing, and solved my battery issues.  I have not yet tried lithium batteries, but that would be my last resort.At some point, about 50 days into ownership, the internal backup battery failed.  Now every time I turn it on, I have to either reset the date, or live with the fact that every images has a date of 1/1/1980.  I now need to send the camera back to Canon for warranty repair (on my dime).The camera is nice, in that it is smallish, and has a nice zoom, but the lens is so slow, and the sensor is so noisy, that it does not work well indoors.  Like most point and shoots, when you set it to auto (for indoor shots), it just sets the aperture wide open, ISO at 400?, flash at full power, and ups the integration time (some times 1/20th second!).  This last thing makes for blurry pictures.Manual control works best for this camera, but is sometimes difficult to use, as it has no 'favorites' button.  I have not played around with CHDK ([...]), but it seems that this might 'fix' some of the problems.I like that as with the S2-IS, the flash is manual, so I can easily control when it is used, and that it takes AA batteries.Also, the auto white-balance does not seem to work well, all my pictures turn out 'yellow'.The LCD is also difficult to see in sun light.One feature which is cool is the 'night-time' shooting mode.  What it does is basically take an image at full resolution, and then bin the picture to a lower resolution, resulting in lower 'noise'.  This is done digitally (software noise reduction algorithm), so the read noise is not reduced, but the light noise, or speckle, is eliminated.  From a block away, I was able to take some pictures of a concert at night at full zoom.Bottom line, is that this camera is fine for outdoor shots (but what camera isn't?).  It is NOT a replacement for a 6 year old S2-IS.  The 14 Megapixel is a gimmick, as there is too much chromatic aberration in the lens to actually resolve each pixel.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Diggy", "ReviewID": "R3HXYQOR64SZFU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will just say, for those that are turned off by other reviews which complain about the battery life, that this camera has no problem with batteries at all.

Otherwise, this is the first point and shoot camera that I had which is able to capture natural colors, as you see them.

I especially bought this camera for two main reasons. I wanted one with a decent mega-pixel rating and also a good OPTICAL zoom.  This camera has both.  The operation is not intuitive so I did have to do some homework but much of it was \"easy\" to operate but I wonder if part of that is because I've owned a digital camera before this one.And to address other's statements that the camera doesn't have an \"automatic\" flash---big deal, does not bother me one bit to physically lift the flash protector----takes less than a second.  And the other issue of using batteries up quickly----not a big problem with me either.  I already had 4 rechargeable AA batteries and just bought four more.  (HINT: If buying rechargeable batteries, buy ones of a different brand from one another so you will not mix the used ones with the fresh)  Considering the camera only holds two batteries, quick usage can be expected. I just carry my spares in my camera bag.One thing does bother me a little and that is the fact that it is \"slippery\".  There is no textured or rubberized plastic on which to grip the camera and keep a good grasp.  I think I may just get in the habit of putting the wrist strap around my wrist and spinning it a few times to tighten. The camera would be better to have two places on which to attach a strap that you could put around your neck.And I'm not sure about the quality of the Macro function with this camera. (Took me a while to realize that option is not available in the Auto mode.)  Don't know if the detail is questionable because when I open the photos in my Cannon software, I can magnify the view so many times that eventually it appears poor.  So that's a relative observation, at best.  But the movie quality is very good, especially when using the zoom.  I don't bother with the digital zoom but even that didn't look bad.  Need to get a tripod to hold the camera steady when zooming during a movie!  (Or maybe a \"mono-pod\")?One thing I found lacking in the Cannon down-loadable Zoombrowser EX software was the inability to downsize photos, and I miss my Photoshop ability to warm the photo with its \"Temperature\" option. Haven't looked deep enough for a way to warm a photo through Cannon's camera software so forgive me.  But you have the option of setting the camera to take lower resolution photos, so you can email them easier.  However, I've found that the quality isn't as good as when I take the photo in full resolution, edit it in other software and downsize it, to send it in an email attachment.One GREAT feature is the on-screen \"notes\" explaining what the different settings do, while choosing different settings on the camera!  It's a quick summary of the function without having to refer to an manual.Others mentioned the speed at which the camera takes photos too.  Again, doesn't bother me at all because I don't find myself in a position of having to take multiple photos in a row. But I also find that the on/off button is being accidentally hit when taking the camera out of my camera case.  It would be better to have that more recessed so you wouldn't turn the power on by mistake.Overall, for the price, this is a pretty good deal and you also have the Cannon name and quality behind you.  I'd recommend to a friend.UPDATE:  Okay, I've had the camera for over three months and I have concerns over the movie mode when using the camera.  When filming, when I move from right to left or \"side to side\" the camera has a problem keeping up with the movement and at the instant I change direction, the picture appears \"sloshy\" for the lack of a better adjective.  For instance, when filming a scene with a four foot high railing, when changing direction, the railing appears to wobble back-and-forth.  Same thing for any object I'm filming when I change directions.  I also have had a problem with the zoom when filming.  Two out of three times, the camera does not focus correctly when zooming at an object that is far away.  I'm talking a distance of approx. three miles.  Don't know if that is typical of cameras like this but on the third try, the object will focus correctly.  So, I moved my five star rating down from five stars to four.Second update: Problems with zoom.  Can now \"hear\" the zoom in my videos and the zoom does not respond correctly.  Focus is not good when zooming either.  Question quality.

However, the past couple of vacations I've taken had me wanting a new camera with a few more features, especially for video and zoom.  After spending a lot of time looking at cameras on a variety of websites, I chose the Canon PowerShot SX150 IS to replace my older Canon.  While the comments about battery life originally had me a little nervous, now that I've used the camera for a couple of months (purchased in Nov) I'm VERY pleased with it's performance.Here's the trick regarding the batteries - go for a QUALITY rechargeable battery.  Rechargeable Energizers, Duracell's, etc are nice, but won't cut for extended periods of time with this camera.  I purchased Eneloop rechargeable's for my old camera (had actually purchased more this past summer for general use), and they work great in the new camera.  When I first got the camera and I put in 'fresh' batteries (ones I thought were charged), the low-battery light immediately came on, so I popped them into my old camera.  Sure enough, the low-battery light came on for the old camera as well.  After that (which was November), I put in what I knew were freshly charged batteries, and I haven't had to change the batteries yet.  So I've used the same batteries for 3 months, taken several hundred photos and videos, as well as having turned it on and off throughout all the photo-taking numerous times.So far my only complaint about the camera is that to use some of the more advanced/fun features I have to do some additional reading of the manual.

I was looking for several main things in my new camera: compatibility with AA batteries,compact (this canon is a bit heavy and bulky but is still ok to fit in a pocket), zoom of at least 10x, HD video, manual settings (for night photos) and low budget (below $300)Why AA batteries?Based on my nikon L2 experience (yeah, I know that camera is really old, but that's why I wanted to get a new one) that used regular AA batteries served me for filming 60+mins of video and several dozens of pictures and also looking through them on the camera, so rechargeable AAs would last at least 2x as much, right?Main complaint: Battery life is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I am about to cry because I thought and researched for an entire month on which camera to pick and this is what I get?Details of main complaint:Firstly, I took 2 panasonic general purpose batteries,- camera would start, work for 5 seconds and then shut off saying \"change the batteries\" Nice start, eh?Secondly, I took regular duracell batteries (brand new of course) that lasted for about 20 pics and a 6 min video and then again \"change the batteries\". I could still take pictures with that camera after I would wait for 30 seconds and turn it on, it would just stop after some time, so even though it works but with all these interruptions by this stupid message \"change the batteries\" I can't shot pictures continuously and I can't shoot a video for more than 6 minutes.Alright, ok, I'm calm, so I decided to use the big guns- brand new rechargeable 2500 mA/h NiMH GP AA batteries (I bought it specifically for this camera). Guess what? 42 pictures (wow, impressive indeed) and about 10 mins of video before the message \"change the batteries\". And once I try to start the camera, it starts, works for only 2 seconds and shuts off. I inserted the second pair of the same rechargeable 2500 mA/h NiMH GP AA batteries that I just charged and once I turned on the camera I saw the battery icon which meant that I should change the batteries soon. What the hell?Picture quality:I wasn't able to take ANY sharp images of moving objects such as pets- nuh-huh, all of 'em were blurry. There's is a lot of compression in the camera going on for eg. why does a 7mp pic weigh 2.2 mb whereas the same EXACT pic with 14 mp weigh only 3.38 mb? what happened to the other 1mb? I'm not an expert on cameras, I might not understand something, but I tried to look for the difference in between those shots and I found NONE (I tried really hard). Same colors, same resolution, same noise, everything the same. Btw, the pictures are noisy once you zoom in even at 80 ISO, but I guess that's ok for a $200 camera? Maybe?Night pictures are pretty good, just be sure to have a tripod so the pictures are sharp. The modes, like miniature, vivid colors, B/W, Sepia, Toy camera (really cool) and others are very nice, I loved them.Video quality:Video seems to be crisp, surely better than the 480p on my old camera, as long as you use an SDHC or SDXC card for HD video (I have a transcend SDHC class 10 8gb card) though the zoom in during the video recording is very slow (some say to prevent blurriness- bulls***, still blurry until I wait for 2 seconds or so to let it focus). For example to go from 1x to 12x zoom in a video you will have to wait for 13 seconds. \"Very\" fast right? The sound is stereo, no complains there. You can't take pictures while filming.Flash:Oh yeah, this baby deserves a separate paragraph. I, personally, like the idea of a manual flash, meaning you can bring it up or down manually. Ok, so you are about to push the button fully down to take a picture, just to observe that it is charging instead of taking a picture. Errr.. ok? So it charges for 2 seconds and only then you can take a picture. Once you took a picture, you have to wait for another 2 seconds for the flash to recharge, seriously? Recharging before and after? Nonsense. Sometimes the flash would recharge for even more than 2 seconds depending on the battery you have (with duracells prepare for about 5 seconds of recharge, those 2s were with the 2500 mA/h batteries)Overall score:If I had a chance, I would give this camera ZERO stars, sure the pictures are ok, and the video is ok.Let's even assume the camera has DSLR quality pictures and full HD video (which it doesn't) are you still willing to change batteries every hour, even rechargeable ones? Let's put it this way, how do you call a car that eats 60gal/mi of gasoline? Exactly-USELESS.Don't buy this, save your nerve cells and precious money, I'm returning this back and I will try to find a better camera.

I got it now despite my A470 still mostly working because of the price I got mine for, because I'd miss out if I didn't get it nowSo far I am very impressed with this camera, however, it does have some minor flaws that are still worth mentioning.On the A470, I only had 3.4x zoom, and this camera is 12x zoom so the extra zoom is a nice perk coming from a budget camera to this camera. I am also very impressed with the IQ of this camera, so much so that it was better then my DSLR camera at taking the same image in the same place, but it has does have some digital noise problems, most likely due to the 14 Megapixel sensor on this camera, but to be fair it is a tolerable level of noise for a sensor of this size this camera uses. This camera also beats my DSLR camera in some ways too, in particular with the DOF this has over my DSLR camera. It also produces brighter and more saturated pictures, and may even outperform a DSLR in some cases.My DSLR does better is digital noise management, but that's because it has a larger sensor(APS-C) then this camera (1/2.3) has. If noise issues can cause an issue for you, I would not recommend this camera and look at something else. I find the issue can be tamed in a program like GIMP or Photoshop just fine if I need to manage the digital noise this produces.This camera WILL NOT use MultiMediaCard since the support has been removed from this camera entirely, but this isn't a big deal since MMC never really took off and was abandoned due to lack of popularity of the format. It may support them unofficially, but I don't have any MMC cards to test this. I have never used a MMC type memory card for that matter, either. This isn't really a con, but more of a buyer's perspective if this is a pro or a con.This camera supports SD cards, SDHC, and SDXC cards, but it also has EyeFi support too, so you can use a EyeFi cards to their full potential in this camera. Due to the SDXC support, you can buy 64GB+ memory cards for this camera too, which makes it even more appealing. Personally, I don't see MMC support being missed when this cam use SD cards larger then 32GB instead. This is certainly a pro, because if you can find cheap SDXC cards, you can use them because they require new reader Hardware inside the camera due to using a different Filesytem and architecture to make such a capacity a reality. I hate to say it, but the thing I think will put these older cameras without SDXC support down is the new Hardware required to use these cards that these older cameras lack. If this sounds like a bad business move, the same thing happened when they went to SDHC from standard SD cards-you probably needed a new camera, unless the manufacturer released a updated Firmware for your camera(spoiler alert: most didn't). Some card readers that don't list SDXC support anywhere don't seem to have a problem with SDXC cards, so you may be in luck if your card reader doesn't list SDXC specifically. My OEM card reader in my Inspiron 530s can read SDXC no problem, so I don't see SDXC compatibility being a major problem with a good chunk of existing card readers. I cannot say for sure if your card reader will read these cards, so you will have to test your reader and see what happens. If yours does, consider yourself lucky. Also, if you reader doesn't accommodate SDHC cards, there is no chance of this being possible, and you will need a new reader. If your card reader doesn't like SDXC cards, I have linked to one if this is the case in the Software section of this review.Battery issuesI see this complaint a lot about AA battery cameras in general, and it gets old very, very quickly: Battery life is a jokeAlkaline batteries CAN NOT be used in ANY digital camera unless you want the runtime to suffer. You have to use Lithium or Rechargeable batteries in it if you want more then 110 pictures out of this, you need Lithium or Rechargeable batteries for good runtime.With NiMh batteries, you get 320 pictures per set of batteries, which isn't too bad but can be improved on by using Lithium batteries.In fact, I would just not even use the bundled batteries, and just use Rechargeable batteries from the start and just bundle a battery charger and rechargeable batteries with the cost of this camera at purchase. You can't do much about the Alkaline battery issue in any digital camera using AA batteries, and the only real way to fix this is use different batteries. In future models, Canon should not include batteries and let the buyer supply batteries to save a little money on this camera. I went as far as to leave the AA batteries in the box because I just used my NiMh batteries in this camera from the start. But you should know these will affect flash recycling times, so charge your flash in advance so you don't miss the shot if it's an important picture if you use NiMh batteries. Alkaline batteries also tend to drag recycling times down too, but not nearly as bad as NiMh batteries can.You need these kind of batteries for it for good runtime from it:eneloop XX 2500mAh Typical / 2400 mAh Minimum, High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesYou also need a battery charger for these batteries, which I have linked one I like below to consider.SANYO 4-Position Ni-MH Rechargeable Battery ChargerThis isn't a pro or a con, it's just a matter of getting the right kind of battery type. If you do it right, the battery life will be good. Do it wrong, and it will be bad.Another option is to use Lithium batteries, but know these will cost more and are not rechargeable, so these will cost more over time but last forever in the camera. I have had Lithium batteries in this SX150 for 4 months and they aren't dead yet. They also seem to make the camera a bit lighter, so these will take a few ounces off the camera too, which is nice because it has some heft to it. I have also noticed better flash recycling times, so using Lithium batteries also helps the flash recycling time. I personally think these are the best option, especially for time critical photography uses in these AA type cameras.Energizer AA Lithium Batteries (8-count), Lasts 9 Times LongerCablesThis no longer includes a Composite A/V cable, so if you need this you will need to buy one separately, or use a cable you have on hand if you have had Canon cameras that included the cable in the past. If you want to know how I feel about this exclusion, it doesn't bother me since this camera is HD capable and kind of redundant to include a cable that was not used by many people in the first place. All I did with this cable was leave it in the box, since it was never much use to me. It still includes a USB cable, but any Mini-USB cable will work with this camera. The only special thing about the USB cable Canon bundled is it says Canon, but otherwise it's a standard Mini-USB cable.This cable will do the job fine if you need the video cableParts Express 3.5mm Plug (4 Pole) To 3 RCA A/V Cable 6 feet.If you want a spare USB cable when you buy the camera, this one will do just fineAmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters)No, this doesn't include a memory card, so you will have to supply your own. I think this decision is smart, because you can sell the camera at a lower price point and appeal to more people, but also in the day and age of HD video and high megapixel cameras, you can't have a small and cheap to produce SDHC in the box anymore. If Canon included a SD card, it would likely raise the price quite a bit. This isn't a pro or a con, but more of a pointless complaint since SD cards aren't expensive. I have 5 SD cards that I deemed good for this camera, because they're so cheap to buy.For cards, get a 16GB SDHC, since this will be your best bet because the images can get quite large.SanDisk Ultra 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card 30MB/s SDSDU-016G-U46If you have a SDXC capable card reader or your SDHC card reader reads them despite it not being mentioned for your reader, it may be worth spending the money on a 64GB SDXC for this cameraSony 64GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 R40 Memory Card (SF64UY/TQMN)SDXC prices are dropping quickly, so there should no longer be a excuse to avoid these cards.Software/FirmwareThe software is good on this camera and easy to use, so no complaints there. It even goes as far as to have a built-in Help menu to describe each function of the camera. Other then this it's typical Canon Firmware and it does what it needs to do. The only piece of Software it includes I don't like is the Canon image viewing software, and image transfer software. If you have Windows XP, you don't need to use this due to the scanner and camera wizard, and photo import applications seeing the camera and allowing importing without Canon software. Windows 7/8 sees it as a Hardware device in Computer, and has built-in export tools that do the same job as the Canon Software does. Don't install the Software on the CD and just use photo programs and the scanner and camera wizard for XP, or let it mount as a removable disk in Win 7/8 instead if you run Windows 7 or 8. You'll be much better off this way if you do this instead. It might even do you good to buy a memory card reader instead, but stick with SDXC compatible ones for some future-proofing, and to have one that can do it if you buy one of these memory cards. I have also linked a good one I like for the price to consider.Transcend USB 3.0 Super Speed Multi-Card Reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC/MS/CF Cards (TS-RDF8K)If you can find a SX150, go ahead and pick it up. This camera is worth every penny I spent on it since I got it. These cameras go fast, so when you see one at the right price, get it as soon as you can get it if you can afford it. I don't regret my decision buying this camera.Would I recommend this over the SX160? Yes, if you can get a good price. from what I have seen with the SX160, it's not much different from the SX150. The only differences I noticed with these cameras is it has one less F-stop(which might make it worse then the 150), 2 more megapixels and 4x more optical zoom. It doesn't seem like it's worth the extra money if you can pick the SX150 up on clearance or open box for next to nothing, or at least very cheap. If the pricing schemes where you buy the camera have similar prices, it might be better to buy the SX160. You can be the judge of if the SX160 is worth the extra money, but I can't find much to justify the extra money, which is why I got this camera instead of the SX160. The Alkaline battery life is also slightly better on the SX160 compared to the SX150, but since Alkaline batteries don't belong in digital cameras this is a moot point to me.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very pleased!!!", "Author": "pjdurrose \"Pam\"", "ReviewID": "ROYO8U59O51X2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great, easy carrying camera.

So I've had around two full days to use my camera and get accustomed to it at this point. I came to this camera as a nice step up from my previous cameras I've owned. Not counting this, I've owned three separate cameras since 2000. A 3 megapixel Vivitar, and a 7.1 and 8.2 Kodak Easyshare. So this camera felt like a nice step up for someone who isn't a professional photographer.That said, I'll start with the one con I have definitely noticed so far and has been very present in the two days I've had it. It just so happened this is something that seems to have been a relatively common mention in reviews--battery life.It's certainly a good camera but the battery life leaves something to be desired. As mentioned, this was a Christmas present from my parents. We open our gifts on Christmas eve. The batters that came included were used up that same night a handful of pictures and a quick video later. Fortunately, I have a relative who can get me batteries for free so I used two I had.Just this morning that I'm writing this review, the low battery signal appeared again. Again it came when I started recording a video. It almost seems to be the video that is a big user in draining the batteries.If you plan on buying this camera, I'd say it would be a good idea to always have extra batteries on hand. Better yet, set yourself up in a position to recharge your batteries when needed.So far, that is my one complaint. The camera, at 14.1 MPs, does take some pretty decent pictures. I'm not disappointed at all there. The camera isn't too bulky like some cameras so it can be pretty easily carried around in your pocket. The camera itself is also relatively simple to learn how to use and what does what. I had no problems learning how to operate it and to do what I need to do with it.With the flash, it's kind of unique among cameras I've owned. On this camera, to use the flash (or get it ready), you manually have to lift it up from the front of the camera. This is neither good nor bad for me. Just the first camera I've ever owned to be done like that.The only reason I don't \"love\" this camera instead and only gave it four stars is the battery issue above.Bottom Line:-Takes good pictures-Easy to learn to use-Fair to perhaps slightly poor battery life but good camera otherwise-If without, buying rechargeable batteries and a charger would be a good decisionUPDATE (5/23/2012):At this point, I've owned this camera for almost five full months. Recently I purchased a set of rechargeable Energizer batteries with a charger that are high powered (2000) mAh batteries. As it turns out, many people suggest getting these for this camera. I didn't know that beforehand but I wanted to point out these batteries so far have worked great.

Our daughter has a previous version (SX130) of this camera and she has been pleased with it.  I read the review on Amazon and noted the battery usage issue, but felt I could do well with some rechargeable batteries.  They have done OK.  The quality of photos is what I wanted to have, and ordered accordingly.  However, I was very disappointed with the clarity of about 30-40 percent of the pictures, taken with a wide variety of settings, according to the scenes I was shooting.  I followed the directions sent with the camera, telling me I need to push the shutter button part way to allow the camera to pre-focus for a clear shot.  When I did that, often the shutter just fired, in spite of my light touch on the button.  Really!  (I experimented by taking a series of photographs of the same scene or person to see what the capabilities of the camera were).  Most of these experimental photos were flawed in some way.The most disappointing was when I took the setting recommended by the camera menu and shot that scene.  The scene was usually not clear and the colors were not vivid like I have come to be used to with other cameras, including my daughter's.  I also found that there is no way the shutter is fast enough to capture the grandchildren moving even slightly when the picture was being taken.  I have taken about 300 pictures since I got the camera, shooting in a wide variety of situations (outside scenery, inside group photos, photographs of individuals, photographs of children playing, photos of Christmas present unwrapping times, etc.)  I have had to delete at least 100 because of the way this camera operated.  I cannot recommend this camera to those of you looking for a good point and shoot camera.

But what it has is indeed very good for the price point, a very good value. I am not a pro user but have owned pro level equipment, the SX 150 IS does a very good job for what it is and what it costs. If you want an under $200.00 camera that has good image quality and will handle most scenes well,you could do much worse. Also a point to think about....if your out using the camera and your batteries become low, slap in some good AA's and keep going. Can not do that with many of the newer units now, AA's are on the way out. That said, high capacity AA nimh batts will serve you well. Have 2 sets and you will be fine.

Good value.  Lots of neat features (plus manual control) and great optical zoom.Pros: Lots of nice art features and scene presets.  Manual controls are really great for \"artsy\" shots. The shutter can stay open for up to 15 seconds, great for night sillhouettes of trees. Time lapse shutter needs a tripod.  Shoots great outdoor shots in full light. Focuses quickly. Great optical (real) zoom level and stable at max zoom. Manual focus lets you decide what the focal plane is (we did this with chrystals with good results) - sometimes nothing beats the human eye.Cons: Lowlight seems a bit noisy. No viewfinder, just an LCD, so it's sometimes hard in full light. It's easy to get caught up in all the settings, but they are there, so that's good (note that it has an easy setting to fall back on). Canon layout takes a little getting used to.Flash charge takes a couple seconds.No issues with batteries - using $13.00 energizer 2000mAH set of 4 with charger - life and time used seems fine - 80 pictures or so.Using a class 10 sandisk memory card, no issues.Originally, we were looking at the elph 300 and chose this because of the optical zoom and manual controls.

Stop with the battery whining!!!!! Get the best rechargeables you can afford and if you are using all the \"stuff\" a camera or other piece of equipment has to offer--get ready to replace them.I have to say, I did a lot of research, and this camera kept coming up and it fit in my current price range/budget. Next, I am impressed with the abilities that this camera has to offer. Nikon and Olmpus also offer cameras similar to this one--and have some of the same problems, functions (lack of), etc. Compare well--for me--it ended up being price. Research well before you purchase and in addition to price, KNOW how you are going to use the camera and its functions so that you do not get disappointment instead of having fun.This is my first Canon (I love Olympus and Nikon) and I am very pleasantly surprised by this camera and its abilities. They are far beyond what I expected and I could not be happier. I will update as I push this camera to its edges.Update December 2011: Several problems did come up. 1.) Flash-it needs time to recover after one or two shots. Not good. You can miss great shots waiting for it. I gave up with the flash and just trusted it to shoot using the light available-little to very low--and I gotta say--it worked a lot better. However 2.) it does not recover focus very fast--in fact, till it is allowed to recover, your next shots will be out of focus/blurred/noisy, etc. Again, you can miss some great shots. There are some ways to fix this last problem, I just need to review those-but I don't think it will help a lot. Note: I was shooting dancers in low light. I need to work this in full/bright light to do a better comparison.The movies this camera shoots are great (don't go looking for super-duper \"gee-whiz\" stuff okay). And I did the movies with the light that was available (little to very-very low) and the movies actually turned out better than a lot of the photos I took. And with the software that comes with the camera (and Photoshop), you can take out single pictures from the movie. This proved to be a wonderful side-trip. I got a lot better photos just shooting with the movie function and taking out the \"photos\". I then layered the good photos over the fuzzy ones and got some fun, interesting work.Now, as for the batteries--I charged up 4 AA and I shot from about 7pm to 11pm going back and forth from single to movie. I only had to change the batteries for the last hour of shooting. I used Duracell's Rechargeable NiMH and a 16gb SCHC series 10 card by Transcend. Even with all that shooting, that card did not even get 1/2 full--I think I will get a 32gb--just for the fun of it and for movies and save the 16gb for photos.I am still happy with this camera, as I use it mainly to shoot my artwork and it does a wonderful job on that kind of single work. And for now, till I save up the $$$$$ to get the DSLR I really want-this is a perfect fill in for the price.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A thoroughly unlovable camera", "Author": "Pericombobulation53", "ReviewID": "R2PY6LJQR4QRE3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm starting to develop an opinion about Canon cameras and it isn't a good one.  I know there are lots of Canon devotees out there, but every model I've owned or played with has been a disappointment.  The specs and reviews of the SX150 IS were good... 14.1 MP and a nice long 12x zoom.  I liked the fact that you could choose aperture priority or shutter priority (if you know what those things mean then you'll appreciate having them).  Also nice is the plus/minus exposure button.  More point and shoots should have this, if for no other reason than because we've all been in situations of trying to shoot a portrait or other subject that is back-lit.  If the camera meters on the background, then the subject will be underexposed.  With the exposure plus/minus button, you can boost the exposure a bit to compensate.That's about where my praise of the SX150IS ends.  I gave this to my wife as a birthday gift because she isn't interested in learning how to use my DSLR and just wanted something that's fairly easy to operate.  I should have unboxed it and tested it out before giving it to her because I quickly would have figured out what a warty little beast this is, and gotten her something else.  The biggest problem it has is with batteries.  I know that all digital cameras are battery hogs and have a certain finite number of pictures that they can take before the battery is drained.  On the SX150IS that number is 8.  It literally started to complain about low batteries after the 8th picture was taken.  And these were brand new batteries too.  We tried different brands of alkalines as well as rechargeables and always the same result... after 8 or 10 pictures it says the batteries are low.So OK maybe mine has a problem with the battery consumption and needs to be fixed by Canon.  I can accept that.  Every manufacturer produces a lemon now and again.  But there were other things I didn't like about this camera.  In low light it produced vertical blue stripes at every light bulb or other bright object.  I'm pretty sure this was not lens flare, but a digital artifact.  What's more, the LCD screen is just about impossible to use in low light because it is so grainy.  In fairness, I'm not saying the pictures were grainy... in fact they seemed to be OK (except those affected by the horrible blue streak).  But how can you expect to compose a nice photo when the LCD display is so grainy that you can barely see what you're shooting?There also seemed to be some issue with the flash.  It worked, but took too long to charge.  On most modern cameras (even cheap point and shoots), the flash should charge within a second or so.  The SX150IS seems to take much longer than that - probably 5-10 seconds, during which it displays \"Charging the flash\" and by that time your subject has moved on.We also weren't impressed by the cheap plasticky feel of this camera.  I think Canon may be on to something in terms of offering a camera that has a longer zoom and more controls than the ubiquitous little rectangle P&S; pocket cameras.  The SX150IS is a little too big for a pocket, but would fit comfortably in a purse or backpack.  If it worked well I could get over the plastic styling.  But our experience with this camera was pretty disappointing, so it's going back.  We've had good luck in the past with Fuji, Panasonic, Nikon, and Pentax, so there are lots of other fish in the sea.  I'm starting to think that the thing Canon does best is advertising.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Takes great pics but...WARNING!

In fact, this is the only one I know off.It does an awesome job. The pictures come out fantastic, even in simple mode (a necessity for my wife), but if you're an advanced-user you will seriously appreciate all the manual controls, which even includes manual focus. No, manual focus does not work *great* but it's available. Also, the 14x Optical zoom is a nice option considering point & shoots lean heavily on digital zooming to save on space.I was seriously impressed with the image quality. Super crisp photos. Lens performance seriously surprising.Bad News: Uses Double Freaking A Batteries. AA! WHAT?!? I almost returned it. But instead I went the other way, finally took the dive into LSD NiMH Batteries, and it's working out okay. But using Alkalines on this thing will KILL you. Seriously, you need to get rechargeables, or at least get the Alkalines designed for electronics. This camera is murder on normal alkalines.Anyway, once I got the charger I realized I can pack spare batteries (and the NiMH make the camera last almost comparable to \"normal\" cameras) plus in a pinch I can always buy normal AAs, like if I forgot to charge a spare pack. Heck, on a normal camera doing that would leave you unable to take pictures. At least I have a backup.The other negative is that the camera is relatively bulky. I highly recommend holding it in person to get a feel for it. This is not a great camera for shoving in your pocket. It's quite large for a P&S; camera.I don't really take movies on them, but the quality seems pretty good. We have a separate camcorder, which we prefer because the audio is better and it can function in lower light settings. The SX150 starts looking pretty dark when taking video in lower light, but the image stays crisp.Summary: If you want a portable point and shoot and don't need a lot of functions, you might wanna keep moving.

I have had plenty of compact cameras, and although the fit-in-your-pocket cameras are a great idea, the pictures have never really done it for me, there's always just that hint of blur or graininess which is so frustrating on that picture that 'would have been great'. So I thought I'd try a 'full size' camera. Well ok, this is an older model, but heck at this price I had to give it a shot (discounted 48% from original RRP when I got it).So I have to be upfront - it DOES chew through batteries. I have no idea why, but it does so do yourself a favour an invest in decent batteries like these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DW7S06/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_10With a fresh pair of these in, and a spare pair along, I've never run out.

Even on busy nights i've gotten through fine, and the great thing is that because it takes standard AA batteries in a pinch you can always find some more to get you through in an emergency.That aside, I've just found it really easy to get really clean, clear crisp pictures with great color and depth with very little effort.

We have purchased a set of four NiMH batteries and charger ($20), but have not used them extensively enough to see if there's a difference. Be aware that if you're shooting inside mostly, you'll need to pack a spare set of batteries if you use the camera for more than an hour.

The camera is slightly chubby but not heavy or bulky.  There is no viewfinder but the digital screen is adequate in low to medium light. IN bright outdoor light the digital screen is useless unless you use your free hand to shade the screen.  Image quality is very nice indeed not SLR quality but nice.  Low light pictures with this camera are ok but not great.  I would not consider this an indoor camera.  With the flash engaged low light pictures are fine IF your subjects are close together and nearby.  The camera uses AA Batteries but eats them up in no time since it lacks a view finder the screen is in always on mode which drains batteries.  The nice thing about a camera that uses AA batteries is that you can buy AA batteries almost anywhere a real plus for disabled folk like me who do not drive.This camera does offer image quality better than all but the latest cell phones.  The camera uses the standard SDHC 10 memory card.  The camera has an automatic lens cap built in. The flash hides away as well making for a compact unit overall.  This camera's image quality is better than all but the very best top of their line best cell phones.  For its price this little camera was a good value.

I agree, with alkaline AA batteries, the battery life is horrible. However, I bought some Duracell rechargeable NiMH 1.2V 2450mAh batteries and this solved the problem. Charge all 4 batteries. Put 2 in the camera and store the other 2 in your bag and you will be fine for dozens of photos. Recording video takes lots of energy. I think the image quality is good. I haven't had time to use all the settings, but I'm happy overall with the results. Pictures taken with the flash indoors are very good quality, although again, the flash uses lots of energy. My previous camera was a Canon PowerShot A620. It took 4 AA batteries and I could literally take hundreds of photos with 4 rechargeable batteries. This camera only takes 2 batteries, so I need to recharge the batteries more frequently. The LCD screen can be somewhat hard to see depending on the lighting conditions. I do really miss the variable angle screen on the A620, however, this camera has a much larger screen which makes previewing photos much easier. The image stabilization works well. The A620 did not have this and I find photos taken in low light without flash turn out well. Some people might think this camera is too big, but I prefer a slightly larger camera because I like having the dials and buttons probably because I learned photography on a 35mm SLR and I still do manipulate settings like Tv and Av.

The image quality is very spot on with little artifacting even when capturing low-light moments. I enjoy all the features as they are very useful & well thought out.The only slight drawback I have found thus far whilst using this camera is the lifespan of alkaline batteries, which is easily remedied by switching to rechargable NiMH types. I purchased an expanded set of NiMH that included eight AA & four AAA including charger for 30 U.S. dollars, ensuring plenty of captured moments, and also saves money on other devices in my collection. [including remote controls & wireless video game controllers, etc.)The full auto setting on this device is worth the admission price alone & even though there is a bit of an initial delay when first using the auto-flash feature, the time becomes quite workable, especially after getting used to it. I enjoy shooting pictures with this camera as it is much more portable than my T3i.I always bring the SX150 IS with me as it certainly makes for a convienent companion to the above mentioned camera. I leave a 75-300mm zoom on the T3i, mounted on a tripod & use the SX150 IS to complement the shooting session & the entire setup can be swapped for even better results. [I shoot mostly musical performing artists].The ease of use, coupled with breath-taking image quality with the ability to easily create prints up to 11x14 for framed wall mountings makes the Canon SX150 IS a must have for everyone, especially those who require prosumer quality without a very steep learning curve. My teenage little ones have quickly learned to enjoy capturing images using this camera & they prefer the ease of use over the 'big boy' DSLR.Enough said. I believe everyone who chooses to buy this product will be quite satisfied with the resulting experience of owning such a quality piece of equipment.Post Script - I have not mentioned the video functionality of this device simply because I prefer using dedicated video cameras whenever shooting movies.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "T E R R I B L E!!!!", "Author": "Jeni", "ReviewID": "RUW4ZCGG78TBE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It would be great if it wasn't for the batteries it needs.

I prefer to use the Auto mode on my cameras since most do a very good job (kudos to all of the manufacturers).  However, I've noticed that on this Canon, the auto focus frame tends to go find and focus on objects other than those that I'm shooting.  As an example, I was in the hummingbird house at the local zoo.  The camera continually focused on the lightest item in the frame rather than the item in the center.  I found that moving the settings to \"Foliage\" allowed a little better control of the auto focus.  In some modes (auto is one), the user is not able to force or stop the flash at will.  Found this to be an issue when I saw drastic light changes in areas that shifted from shade to bright light.  If I needed to change the flash setting in Auto mode, I would have to either raise or lower the flash and wait for the flash to charge.

The only point-n-shoot camera I have used besides this camera was one of the very first Sony Cybershot cameras back in 2001. I chose this one because it had the best optical zoom (12x) than any of the other Canon PnS cameras I looked at in the same price range. (note: I turn digital zoom off because it is crap on EVERY camera so optical zoom is a huge selling point for me).Let me just say that the size and features of this camera are awesome! It is very light weight and fits into the back pocket of jeans moderately easily (its a little bulky in the pocket but it didn't bother me - there are thinner cameras so if fitting it into a pocket is mandatory and bulkiness will bother you then I don't think I would fully recommend this one). The features of the camera blew me away. I used the automatic settings most of the time (wasn't creating art - just capturing memories) and used the snow and miniature mode a lot. Both modes are awesome and I especially like the miniature mode. Very cool effect!But now the downside... this camera EATS AA batteries. Once you put in a fresh pair of AA batteries, you'll start seeing the low battery indicator flashing on the screen really soon. It really depends on how quickly you take photos to really know how many shots you can take on a single set of batteries. I was touring museums and walking through various cities with it and I would get about 30 to 50 photos before the low battery indicator started flashing on the screen. I am so glad that I took a massive jumbo pack of AA's (36 or 48 pack) or else I would have run out. Not sure if this camera will fit the custom Canon batteries that supposedly last longer than regular batteries. You could buy a bunch of rechargeable batteries but you'll need a lot if you're going to be away from a place where you can charge them frequently.I would recommend getting a similar Canon PnS camera with the same features and modes as this one but with either the custom Canon batteries or one that has better power ratings *IF* you plan on going on extended hikes or to places where carrying additional batteries or recharging batteries is not possible. If you're just going to use this for around the house, in the car, or other casual use then I would recommend it for the features and extended optical zoom alone.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Rae", "ReviewID": "R2QCJYHAMZYMSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, I bought it for my grandma for Christmas, and she loves it.

The Elphs are similarly priced.  The advantage embedded in the SX150? --- of course, the 12x zoom.

The ONLY issue I have with this camera is the battery life.

AA batteries are larger, lower voltage, and hold less charge than the specially designed rechargeable batteries used in most cameras.  However, they have the advantage of being easily replaceable by batteries available almost anywhere.So, if you want a camera for mostly outdoor use and you want it to run on AA batteries, this camera deserves serious consideration, especially for the price.  If you want your camera for mostly indoor use and don't care if it uses AA batteries or not, there are better choices.Strengths:1.  As mentioned above, it takes AA batteries.2.  It is inexpensive, so if dropped, no big loss.3.  Unlike almost all other AA battery cameras, it has a full assortment of exposure modes that a competent photographer requires.  Auto, Programmed, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, and Manual.4.  At 80 ISO the sensor noise is reasonable and the lens quality is more than good. High quality images are possible if you know what you're doing.5.  While not terribly compact or light (a product of the AA battery format), the camera has rounded curves and is still pocketable.6.  The photo stabilization system is very, very effective.7.  It has a reasonably long zoom (12x).Weaknesses:1.  Since it runs on 2 AA batteries (3V), the flash takes a long time to charge and is weak.  On the bright side, the flip up design reduces red eye, and you can adjust the flash intensity as desired.2.  The sensor is noisy at anything above ISO 200 ... very noisy.3.  The response time is slow.4.  Mine has noticeable vignetting at long focal lengths.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not good for close-ups", "Author": "R.

I liked the zoom and resolution plus added features and controls. I used the panorama stitch assist mode a few times for some neat landscape photos. Since the SX150IS seemed to be an upgrade in all ways and was cheaper as well (it had already been replaced by the SX160IS), I didn't even do a lot of research and just bought it. However, after a few months of using the SX150IS, I have learned that Canon seems to be cutting some corners. The 14.1 megapixel resolution is really closer to 10 MP effective, according to some review websites (and looking at full resolution pictures, I would agree). The panorama stitch assist is gone. And it seems to me that colors aren't represented as well and exposure selection isn't on target. You can try tweaking the exposure when outdoors by half-pressing the shutter at a brighter piece of sky to make the picture a little darker, but I was having to do this quite a bit (or change it through the menus which is more precise, but takes a little longer). In low light there is a good bit of noise, which maybe is typical for a camera at this price point, though some do better than others. I don't like the way they do the macro either. Previously it was a setting and once it was in macro, it stayed in macro. Now it sort of automatically pops in as needed. It doesn't seem as good and I had a harder time taking macro shots with this camera vs. the old one. Also the camera is fairly slow between pictures. In the end, I felt like it was more trouble than it was worth and I wanted something that was better than my old camera rather than worse. Even though I had only had the SX150IS for a few months, I ended up going for a significantly more expensive mirrorless camera with a bigger sensor, the Samsung NX1000 Black ~ 20.3MP Digital Camera with 20-50mm Lens, which doesn't have as good a zoom but otherwise should be very good.

There are pros to using this camera - it is definitely easy to use and there are many settings to make it easy to point and shoot. However, and this is a big one, the battery life is HORRIBLE. I put brand-new batteries in the camera and before I even actually use the camera, it has sucked some of the juice out of them. I find that if I keep the batteries out of the camera until I need to take pictures, it helps, but really, who wants to have to do that? This is unbelievably inconvenient. My last camera certainly didn't have as much of a zoom and didn't take such nice pictures but it had a reusable battery pack and charger. And it lasted for the whole day when I took my camera with me to shoot pictures. I wasn't constantly fumbling to replace spent batteries while missing important photo ops. I have seen other reviews that say use the rechargable batteries, and I do but I don't find that their battery life is much better in this camera as it is constantly pulling the juice from the batteries. It is getting very expensive to keep up with the amount of batteries needed to run my camera.  Video? Not terrific either. Oh, the picture and sound is fairly decent for capturing what I am aiming to get on video, but the batteries sometimes run out in the middle of shooting. I have to stop videotaping, put more batteries in, and resume - of course, missing special moments. And I am NOT talking long video recordings either! Plus, the darn camera heats up incredibly in the battery compartment when I am shooting five minutes or more of continuous video.  The other issue that I have with this camera is I lose virtually all spontaneous pictures of my kids that I try to take because the darn flash takes a ridiculous amount of time to charge at first use and in between every use. About 6 or 7 seconds to recharge means that I have missed the picture that I was hoping to capture. It als means that I can't keep shooting as things are happening, I have to sit and wait while I see the message battery charging, then I can shoot another picture. Horrible performance in this department. It's just really slow all around.  I am overall very disappointed with this camera and definitely do not recommend that anyone spend their money on a camera like this when there are so many others out there with better all around performance.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had to return it.", "Author": "Kingy47", "ReviewID": "RUIYEDBWC7KK1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is super bulky and had problems using the flash.

The only surprise was the decision to return top AA batteries on these models but I do understand why as we have probably all experienced the cell battery dying and not being able to recharge, especially if you are away from the house or on vacation in another country.

Here's a comparison of the total amount of shots (without flash) I was able to take before the camera shut down because of the low battery warning:Radio Shack HR6 (6 years old): 20 shotsPanasonic 1950 (9 years old): 48 shotsSanyo Eneloops (new): 96 shotsBased on those results I estimate about 3 pairs of good quality NiMh batteries should be more than sufficient to take care of my shooting stints at any one time.Honestly the camera has everything that I need at this stage and for the 100 bucks I paid, I'm more than happy.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "Vinh", "ReviewID": "R2CE6DAXWE0YX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is very good  i liked , i gave my friend for  birthday , I think .they will be enjoy with it", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"AZ Guy RN\"", "ReviewID": "R8I4TGGRFL3QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great pictures & easy to use.

The SX 150 appealed to me due to its 14.1 mega pixels, good zoom, and great price available from a variety of retailers. My wife uses the SX 160 which is more compact, which is why I am only giving the 150 4 stars, but its ease of use, excellent picture quality, and 40x digital zoom make-up for the size.I am not big on using the manual settings but they seem to be of value for more serious photographers; am pretty content with the automatic point and shoot choices for most travel situations. Low light without flash is good, particularly helpful in chuches or museums where \"no flash\" is allowed.Have used point and shots with both AA single use and lithium rechargable batteries. I personally prefer the Energizer Lithium (silver and blue) which yield the highest number of shots, or longest video time. I have averaged 200-250 shots on better cameras (Panasonic Lumix) and reaching as many as 350 on older, less featured ones (simpler Kodaks).Rechargables AA's are ok, but you will rearely get a full day of shooting from one pair, needing spares and a good multi recharger for overnight.Canon has always produced excellent cameras from really small point and shoots (the original Elf's) to full DSLR's.

The camera is very smart, captures color very nicely, its very easy to work with and has great functions. The lenses are awesome, and the pictures comes out very clear and beautiful. The only reason why I give this camera 4 stars is it's size. It is a bit bulky for my taste. But you can't beat the less than $150 price! Its worth way more than that.I did purchase a Battery charger for it here on Amazon because the battery's life is really short! But with the charger I have no problems at all. If you are vacationing and this is your camera, make sure you buy the charger and plug in every night, cause you will run out of battery pretty fast.In resume: great pictures, easy to work with, awesome price and a true CANON!

I took pictures of the Statue of Liberty from the Staten Island Ferry and they were so clear that you could see a bird perched on her crown.There are many complaints in other reviews about battery life, which I have to agree. The batteries DO NOT last long. Throughout my trip, which was only 4 days and I took 249 pictures, I had to change out batteries 4 times. I asked my camera experienced friend about it and she explained, that is what you get with cameras that take real batteries and not rechargeable.

Paid a bit more than this (what ever the current price shown is), but walked out of the store with it. Used it minutes later.My verified purchaser copy of this review is at the Canon SX130. Liked the 150 so well that I ordered the slightly less featured 130 a couple of days after buying the 150.Controls are \"intuitive\" if you have had a few digital cameras. Pics look great for the documentation and illustration that I do. All the features and gee-wiz may be fantastic for all I know. Do you need a self-timer that starts when you enter the picture and blink your eyes? I don't think I do, but you might.Easy access to manual control is great when images must match in exposure for after-the-fact editing. No raw output tho. Turn off the image review or you spend your time waiting in between pics.Larger size and greater weight make it easier to hand hold especially in lower light. And image stabilization really works well. This camera could better use strap lugs, rings, and a shoulder strap instead of a wrist strap. Ring type selector around the function set button beats hell out of a slew of tiny buttons and lots of tabbed sub menus. - A little too easy to bump things tho while intending to change one setting and accidentally changing another.Experiments moving from sensitivity of 80 or 100 have been mixed. I'm not impressed. With most digitals and oh so long ago with film I have found that higher sensitivity is a trade-off with noise.This camera uses batteries.

It had an electrical fault, which meant that it churned through my first and second sets of new alkaline AA batteries in about fifteen minutes (and ten photos) each - and the third set registered empty the moment I put them in.Be mindful as you read this, that I'm loyal to the Canon brand, and am comparing this machine to what I've used of their cameras in past years. If you're a convert from a brand like Panasonic, you might be rightfully wowed by what Canon delivers in the SX150IS. However, personally, I'm disappointed.Canon has excellent photo quality, and this camera appears to be no exception to that rule. Certainly, this model has more resolution, and therefore less dreaminess in the color quality than my 6 megapixel S3IS model I was so fond of and which was stolen from me last spring in Hawaii. The SX150IS case visually looks very nice: it's matte, rather than glossy - which means that the suave look will last longer. Sadly, however, the camera somehow isn't made in a way that molds to your hand, unlike the S3 series. The SX150 does have a nice weight to it, though - and thus feels very professional (and this probably helps to stabilize panning while taking films).I'm kind of disappointed that camera technology hasn't iterated as quickly in five years as you would expect from computer desktop technology or cell phone tech. Certainly, there are some important improvements to button layout, including dedicated picture review button, and on/off button, and a little bit easier layout of the functions around the wheel. That will no doubt make a huge difference for good in a person's day-to-day use of the camera.Even using a tripod, the quality of the photos at the full extent of the optical zoom is really tawdry; it's almost as if you passed the photo through an \"oil-paint\" photoshop filter. There's a reason why people want an optical zoom rather than a digital zoom, and there doesn't seem to be much improvement with this camera.The one really thoughtful bit of engineering that I immediately was impressed with, is that the screen is actually set back half a centimeter - behind a piece of plexiglass which is, itself, flush with the housing.

This SX150 is a fail. The battery life is short (only 2x AA, not 4), the flip-flash inconvenient (why hide the flash?!), the recycle time after flash is overlong (forget using with kids), no actual viewfinder, the LCD viewfinder does not swivel.  In short, this camera is a disappointment and makes me refrain from taking pictures.  Let me repeat, this camera is so bad I no longer care if I do not take pictures of my kids.The indoor photos are grainy and have a weird yellow-ish tone to them, even with flash.  I cannot determine which of the auto setting are for sports.  The grip area is too small for my hands and the camera is too lightweight to have enough inertia for one-handed use. The flash has some weird timing to it - like it does not really read the distances right.  If the object being photographed is not in the flash area sweet spot, it does not really illuminate well and the contrast gets all messy.The fixed LCD viewfinder is so large it takes up all of the camera interface on the back, leaving barely enough room for the buttons.  I'm sure it contributes to why the battery life is so short.  Why do manufactures insist on such small buttons?! Whoever is the marketer or designer that thinks hiding buttons and keyboards is a good thing should be told that a camera is a tool, not their design-school art project.  I miss the A650 so much more after having this camera.I used to be a real Canon fan, but the ZR500 camcorder (does not play all MiniDV speeds) and this SX150 (lacking key features) have me less of one.Key feature for us are: AA batteries (yes), swivel LCD viewfinder (no), good recycle time between shots (no), Firewire (no) and USB connectivity (yes), 4-conductor 1/8in A/V breakout jack, image stabilization, good actual and digital zoom (yes), and real-world colored pictures (no), and a reasonable price.2/25/2012 update - was trying to use video recording function and batteries lasted only 10 mins.

I was looking for several main things in my new camera: compatibility with AA batteries,compact (this canon is a bit heavy and bulky but is still ok to fit in a pocket), zoom of at least 10x, HD video, manual settings (for night photos) and low budget (below $300)Why AA batteries?Based on my nikon L2 experience (yeah, I know that camera is really old, but that's why I wanted to get a new one) that used regular AA batteries served me for filming 60+mins of video and several dozens of pictures and also looking through them on the camera, so rechargeable AAs would last at least 2x as much, right?Main complaint: Battery life is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I am about to cry because I thought and researched for an entire month on which camera to pick and this is what I get?Details of main complaint:Firstly, I took 2 panasonic general purpose batteries,- camera would start, work for 5 seconds and then shut off saying \"change the batteries\" Nice start, eh?Secondly, I took regular duracell batteries (brand new of course) that lasted for about 20 pics and a 6 min video and then again \"change the batteries\". I could still take pictures with that camera after I would wait for 30 seconds and turn it on, it would just stop after some time, so even though it works but with all these interruptions by this stupid message \"change the batteries\" I can't shot pictures continuously and I can't shoot a video for more than 6 minutes.Alright, ok, I'm calm, so I decided to use the big guns- brand new rechargeable 2500 mA/h NiMH GP AA batteries (I bought it specifically for this camera). Guess what? 42 pictures (wow, impressive indeed) and about 10 mins of video before the message \"change the batteries\". And once I try to start the camera, it starts, works for only 2 seconds and shuts off. I inserted the second pair of the same rechargeable 2500 mA/h NiMH GP AA batteries that I just charged and once I turned on the camera I saw the battery icon which meant that I should change the batteries soon. What the hell?Picture quality:I wasn't able to take ANY sharp images of moving objects such as pets- nuh-huh, all of 'em were blurry. There's is a lot of compression in the camera going on for eg. why does a 7mp pic weigh 2.2 mb whereas the same EXACT pic with 14 mp weigh only 3.38 mb? what happened to the other 1mb? I'm not an expert on cameras, I might not understand something, but I tried to look for the difference in between those shots and I found NONE (I tried really hard). Same colors, same resolution, same noise, everything the same. Btw, the pictures are noisy once you zoom in even at 80 ISO, but I guess that's ok for a $200 camera? Maybe?Night pictures are pretty good, just be sure to have a tripod so the pictures are sharp. The modes, like miniature, vivid colors, B/W, Sepia, Toy camera (really cool) and others are very nice, I loved them.Video quality:Video seems to be crisp, surely better than the 480p on my old camera, as long as you use an SDHC or SDXC card for HD video (I have a transcend SDHC class 10 8gb card) though the zoom in during the video recording is very slow (some say to prevent blurriness- bulls***, still blurry until I wait for 2 seconds or so to let it focus). For example to go from 1x to 12x zoom in a video you will have to wait for 13 seconds. \"Very\" fast right? The sound is stereo, no complains there. You can't take pictures while filming.Flash:Oh yeah, this baby deserves a separate paragraph. I, personally, like the idea of a manual flash, meaning you can bring it up or down manually. Ok, so you are about to push the button fully down to take a picture, just to observe that it is charging instead of taking a picture. Errr.. ok? So it charges for 2 seconds and only then you can take a picture. Once you took a picture, you have to wait for another 2 seconds for the flash to recharge, seriously? Recharging before and after? Nonsense. Sometimes the flash would recharge for even more than 2 seconds depending on the battery you have (with duracells prepare for about 5 seconds of recharge, those 2s were with the 2500 mA/h batteries)Overall score:If I had a chance, I would give this camera ZERO stars, sure the pictures are ok, and the video is ok.Let's even assume the camera has DSLR quality pictures and full HD video (which it doesn't) are you still willing to change batteries every hour, even rechargeable ones? Let's put it this way, how do you call a car that eats 60gal/mi of gasoline? Exactly-USELESS.Don't buy this, save your nerve cells and precious money, I'm returning this back and I will try to find a better camera.

Also with the flash, I'd take one photo and it would say 'Charging flash' before I could take another. Meanwhile I was missing photo ops occurring right in front of me. I didn't care for the photo quality indoors without the flash on. Not really a good camera choice for kids & pets.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "canon power shot", "Author": "wendyband", "ReviewID": "R3MK7A87AQB55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera.

The camera also ate my batteries.  I asked a cousin who does photography professionally and she said because the camera has a really good flash, but only takes 2 AA batteries, the batteries are not sufficient enough for the flash.  That is why it has to charge the flash and it's why it eats batteries.This was my second Cannon that I have bought and returned, I haven't owned a Cannon before, but I have not been impressed so far.
