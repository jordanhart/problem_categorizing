I gave the camera 5 stars because it is the best Super Zoom I have found so far and I don't mean to imply it is better than any other class of camera. It is not cheap but is well worth the $509 I paid for it. It is a real keeper. You can read a good professional review at [...][UPDATE 10/11/12  I guess they don't allow the link so simply Google ePhotoZine Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 Digital Camera Review and you should get to it.]I have taken a couple hundred photos with the FZ 200 in the last couple of weeks and found this to be the camera I have been looking for. It will be more than a couple of years before I feel the need to upgrade again.I compared the FZ200 with the following cameras I have used:1) Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ282) Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ1003) Canon SX404) Canon Rebel T3i Not really a fair comparison but used it as a high water mark for the FZ200 to aim for.Now for what I like about the FZ 200:1) The 25 to 600mm f2.8 Leica lens: I find that the 24x lens enough reach for my needs. I found no aberrations from the lens. Maybe you could find some with instruments but I couldn't find any. Just as important is the f2.8 across the entire focal length. It allows you to go out to 600mm and take sharp subject and blurred background. It also helps with low light shots and keeping the iso lower.2) Photo quality: Color saturation was very good as was sharpness so photos seemed natural. It is as good or better than the other digital cameras I have used. One reviewer said he saw a blue tint on outdoor pictures and a red tint in flash pictures. I saw none of that but I did have my camera set to scenery when taking outdoor pictures so maybe there was a white balance shift with that function. You can see photo examples in the review mentioned above.3) Burst Speed: It's 12 frames per second burst is very fast but I make more use of the 5.5 fps. At 5.5 fps the specs say it goes to 200 pictures at one time but I haven't gone that far yet.4) Low light performance: It has really improved. The photos I took in a dimly lit room turned out surprisingly well. It seems like it sees about as well as I do in low light. Naturally, noise gets worse as the iso goes up but even at iso 1600 the pics are kind of OK if you don't view over 8 x 10. I now take indoor pictures without flash most of the time with very good results.5) Design: It feels really good in my hands. It has room for all of my fingers and not at all unstable.6) Video: If you like video you will love this camera. It is so much better than cameras like the Canon SX40. Lots of options up to full 1080P 60 fps. Focus is quick and accurate. Zoom is smooth, quiet and the stabilization makes hand held scenes very steady. Unless you are a serious cinematographer you will have no need for a dedicated video camera. In MP4 it is limited to 30 minute scenes but you can go to 4 hours AVCHD. It even has a 3D mode but I haven't used it.7) Viewfinder: The viewfinder resolution is excellent giving a very clear view for composition. I wear reading glasses so a good viewfinder is important.8) Tons of cool features I haven't had a chance to use yet.What I don't like:1) I wish it cost less.If your interested in my camera experience:I am an amateur but have been interested in photography for many years. I bought my first SLR in the 60's and my first digital camera (1MP) in 1997 and have been purchasing a new digital about every other year since then. My first Panasonic was the Lumix DMC FZ28 which I found to be the best for its time and still use it today. I then purchased the Pansonic Lumix DMC - FZ100 because of the great experience with the FZ28 but picture quality was a disappointment. I decided I needed to get a better camera so I purchased the 12MP Canon SX40HS because of the longer lens but ended up returning it. It wasn't a bad camera but I found that the image stabilization broke down at maximum focal length unless I could keep the shutter speed very fast. The pictures were sharp but colors a little less saturated than I like and the body construction feeling less sturdy than the Panasonic. I checked out the Panasonic FZ 150 because of all the great reviews and decided to buy it but held off when I heard about a new Panasonic coming out in August. The FZ 200 cost a little more than FZ 150 but I think it is well worth it. My wife has a DSLR  18MP Canon Rebel T3i and we have taken the same shot and compared the photos. They are very similar with the T3i better in resolution as expected due to the much large sensor which also makes it much better in low light.Why a Super Zoom:If this is the first time you are considering a super zoom it may be useful to know why I bought one when we have a perfectly good DSLR. For quick snaps we have a pretty pocket camera or we use the 8 MP phone camera. They are OK but lack flexibility. DSLRs are high quality but to travel with them, even on a day trip we need to carry a significant camera bag to carry the camera and a couple of lenses. Forget a long telephoto, they are too expensive (Canon 600mm cost about $13K) and too heavy (unless you are a pro and then I don't think you are reading my review). There is a group of moderate zoom cameras that are a little too big to slip in a pocket but smaller and less zoom than the super zoom. My thinking is that if it doesn't fit in my pocket I want all the zoom I need. A super zoom like the FZ200 gives you the flexibility to take pictures of people grinning on couches to birds in a tree across a field. For travel, the zoom and choice from point and shoot to full manual in a compact package makes it the best travel camera possible.I hope this review proves useful. I always read reviews before I buy and I wanted to give back.UPDATE: July 8, 2013  I have been using the camera since October and I am just as happy as I was when I purchased it. There are very many reviews on the camera now so there is plenty advice to get. For those who read mine, I just wanted to point something out that would have made my decision easier had it been available. If you look through my comments you will find one written by Antonio M. Magalhaes referring to a series of YouTube tutorials on the FZ200 By Graham Houghton. Besides explaining how to use the camera it also goes over most of the features. This series is a real gold mine and Panasonic should buy them and include with each camera sold.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am very impressed with this camera.", "Author": "George Burke \"padman\"", "ReviewID": "RU6DFOCI5W2A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had it about 24 hours, but my first impressions are very favorable.  I pre-ordered my Panasonic FZ200 from Amazon last week.  Later I heard it was going to begin shipping on Monday, August 27th.  To my pleasant surprise, the camera showed up yesterday, on Monday, August 27th.  (Gotta love Amazon.)  I played with the various controls and read the manual last night and spent a couple of hours shooting with it today.Some background:  Both my wife and I are long time Canon DSLR photographers.  I am in the printing business and have been using Photoshop since version 2.5 almost 20 years ago.  We are serious amateurs, not professional photographers, but we know our way around digital cameras and the digital darkroom.  We compete in various photo competitions all over the world.  Either with electronic images or prints.  Our maximum print size is 12\" x 18\".  Except for action shots, we shoot RAW exclusively.We are both in our mid 70's and lugging around our Canon 40Ds with 28-300mm lens seem to get heavier every day.  The specs on the FX200 are so spectacular that I wondered if it could be a replacement for our heavy, and somewhat obsolete, Canon gear.  I frankly didn't expect the FZ200 to be as good as our Canon gear.  Instead, my question was \"is it good enough\" for us to continue to be competitive in photo competitions.  To my pleasant surprise, my initial reaction is yes.We live in Florida a few miles from the Gulf of Mexico.  We went to the beach today and took along one of our Canon 40Ds and the FZ200.  We shot the same thing under similar conditions.  The Canon shot only RAW and the FZ shot BOTH taw and jpeg.  I haven't figured out how to use the Panasonic RAW software yet, so we ended up comparing Canon raw with FZ high quality jpegs.When viewed \"right out of the camera\" on my 27\" color calibrated iMac, the images look virtually identical.  Needless to say, I am very impressed.The FZ has a lot of special features and functions I haven't looked at yet, and maybe never will since I am so conversant in Photoshop I really don't need the camera to add saturation, convert to B&W;, etc.  I am totally unfamiliar with digital video, so it will be a while (if ever), before I get around to checking it out on the FZ.The camera isn't perfect.  Here are several things I'm not too fond of.*  The menu system is quite complex and various buttons and wheels access different parts of it.  Tip:  Put the camera in Manual (M) before going to the menu system.  This is the only setting that shows ALL the possible menu settings according to Panasonic tech support.*  The user manual on the CD seems to be for a different camera than the FZ200.  Either that or, the final version of the camera doesn't match an earlier version of the documentation.*  Worse of all, it takes 45 arrow and/or button clicks to perform the \"Format card\" function in the camera.  (I counted them.)  I talked to two different Panasonic tech support people to see if there was an easier way.  They both confirmed that there wasn't.  You won't find it in your user manual, so here is how to format your SD card.*  Set the mode to manual.  Then click the \"Menu/Set\" button in the center of the arrow keys.  Then hit the left arrow key to select the camera icon.*  The click the down arrow key two times to get the the settings (looks like a wrench.)*  Then click the right arrow key to go \"Clock Set.\"  Notice that the top right corner shows that you are on page one of 8 setting page.  Format is on page 7.  Unfortunately, you cannot access the page numbers and right click to advance to the next page.Instead you have to click the down arrow and scroll, completely through each page to advance to the next page.  It takes 43 down arrow clicks to get to format.  (I counted them.)  BE CAREFUL.  Be sure to hit the right arrow key when you reach format.  I hit the \"menu/Set\" button and had to start all over again.Formatting an SD card is a real pain, but that is really the only fault I can find so far with this camera.  Hopefully, Panasonic will fix this is an firmware upgrade-especially as they tell you in their manual not to format the card in your computer but instead do it in the camera.  This is good advise, but a nuisance to do.To end on a positive note, I'm going to continue to play around with this camera, but I feel I have already proven to myself that this camera is fully able to replace our Canon 40Ds for our intended use.  Try it.  I think you will like it too.  (I don't work for Panasonic or Amazon.)", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "F3 \"flyfishfan\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQFTLUQL2ND5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with a little hesitation and skepticism.  Could it really take decent pictures with that kind of zoom range and f-stop?  Admittedly, I am a tough sell since I usually shoot Canon DSLRs with their L-series lenses, and was looking for a light backpacking/walk around camera for times when I didn't want to carry so much bulk and weight.This weekend I shot hundreds of pics indoors and out, from bright sun to no-flash museum settings.  All images were shot in camera RAW and in Program mode, but I let the camera makes its own choices about shutter speed and limited the ISO to a max of 400 (the ability to set a max ISO is a nice feature).  I processed all of the images with the \"Silkypix\" software that comes with the camera (which is a surprisingly capable program).The images were, in short, far better than just good.  Some were truly remarkable.  In the museum where no flash was allowed, I was able to shoot great macros in low light, then a full-room shot at wide angle, then immediately zoom to 600 mm and grab a shot of something sitting on a desk across the room, all handheld.  Outdoors, in bright sun, I was blown away by the crispness of the images at full zoom. And having such a wide range of focal lengths gave me the equivalent of carrying a whole bag of \"big\" gear.One question that has come up on this board is the camera's low light capability.  I would give it a plus/minus here.  Once you get past about ISO 400, noise does start being noticeable in the RAW files.  By comparison to a more expensive DSLR (e.g. a Canon 7D) the noise becomes quite noticeable at ISO 800, but it is very smooth and could be dealt with via software, I have no doubt.  This is an area where someone will have to judge for themselves what amount of noise is \"too much\" at a given ISO.  For me, if I knew I was going to do a lot of shooting of moving subjects in low light, this camera might not be the best choice.  (Note that if the low-light shooting is of still scenes, the camera performs beautifully.) Given the camera's other remarkable capabilities, I don't think it is much of an issue generally.I haven't played with the video at all yet.Yes, I have a few minor gripes, but they are minor indeed.  There is only a little \"basic function\" printed manual -- the full manual comes on a CD as a PDF file.  Having the PDF is great if you need to quickly find a reference, but a printed manual should also come with the camera.  For mine, the manual does match the camera, at least as far as I have found.  I did not format the memory card, just threw one in from another Canon camera, and the Lumix was perfectly happy. It created its own directory and there have been no issues whatsoever doing it that way. You can quickly get to the format function if you cursor up to page 8 from page 1, rather than going through all the other pages.  The menu system is a little complex in some areas and I sometimes find it hard to remember where different functions are buried, but most of those are things you set once and forget about, at least the way I shoot.  Build quality is a little plasticky, something you notice if you have mostly owned metal-bodied cameras and lenses, but hopefully the camera will be tough enough to survive some backpacking and such.  A nice lens hood is included with the camera, and it will accept 52mm filters.All in all, I am really amazed at this little camera with the huge lens.  For my shooting needs - an easy five stars!FOLLOWUP:  Just returned from a week-long hiking trip into southern Utah canyonlands and wanted to report that this camera performed exactly as I had hoped.  It was very light and far easier to deal with than my Canon DSLR with a couple of L-series lenses.  Although I usually shoot RAW, I even shot some straight JPGs and the results were quite good.  Still a two-thumbs up choice, from my perspective.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is one fantastic camera", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R2O23TRXYOLHL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I am obsessive about photography, I have tried the Olympus and Panasonics 4:3 cameras, the Nikon P510, and the Panasonic FZ200. Since I really don't want to be bothered with having to change lenses all the time, the super-zooms are attractive, and since I have been in love with my little Panasonic ZS5 for the past 3-4 years, I was hoping the Panasonic super-zoom would be an easy transition. I was not mistaken.After two weeks of using the FZ200 and taking about 1000 photos, I can confirm that it is a superior camera. This camera is FAST - you should see the photos of the PSU women's basketball games I have taken. And the F2.8 widest aperature applies throughout the huge zoom range - a super-zoom first. The colors are fantastically realistic - you should see the Happy Valley sunsets and sunrises I have taken. The focus is nearly instantaneous and precise - you should see some of the macros I have taken. The manual focus is easy to use and spot on - you should see some of the difficult close-ups over water and ice I have taken (it's hard for AF to focus with an ice background). The stabilization is the best I have ever seen - you should see some of the maximum zoom hand-held photos I have taken.It is light. It comes with a lens hood. The front of the lens if threaded so it will take filters and super macro add-ons. It allows you to store 4 custom settings. It had HDR. It feels solid and fits nicely into the hand. It has a 3\" articulated, high resolution LCD. It has a large, high resolution view finder. It has 3 programmable function buttons. The battery seems to last forever. It has so many ways to correct or edit photos that you will be learning how each of these things works for years to come. It is quiet. It looks professional.As you can see, I could go on and on...and I'm not a Panasonic or Amazon employee.Now a few drawbacks; after all, nothings perfect.I'm replacing the FZ200 I got with a new one because when I make a lot of setting changes quickly it gets overloaded, locks up, and needs to be restarted - not a huge problem but irritating sometimes. As a previous reviewer said, it is strange that Panasonic didn't put a more detailed Quick Menu on this camera like the ZS5 has. Perhaps that's because a lot of those functions are located in buttons on the camera body. It takes a little effort to remember that you set the AF,Macro, and Manual focus on the lens barrel instead of in the software - different from little point & shoots. So far I have not found a case like they used to make for the old film SLRs. I'd rather have a case instead of a \"bag\" as advertised on the webpage. And...if you're coming from a small P&S;, it's an adjustment to learn where all the controls are on the camera body.But it's worth it. This is a superior camera and Panasonic has set a very high bar in the super-zoom arena.EnjoyDecember 22-26, 2012 update:Yes, I will upload some photos after Christmas sometime. Here's what I have learned after at least another thousand photos:1. I continue to really like the camera. The 2.8 lens is terrific and this camera is VERY FAST - both the lens and the electronics.2. The electronic manual focus is tricky and takes some patience and practice. I think I would prefer a manual focus ring, but I guess I can't have it all.3. I still think the quick menu is helpful but hard to use. It improves with practice, but is not as good as the quick menu on my P&S; SZ7.4. I have had to learn a new way of thinking about macro with the 2.8 lens. The large lens opening that the 2.8 aperture provides means a faster shutter speed and lower ISO, but it also means a very small depth of field. I've found that it helps to actually shoot macro in aperture mode and increase the aperture in order to increase the depth of field. Also...use one-area metering and change the size and location of the focus to where you want it - as described on page 96 in the manual. Exposure bracket to cover all your bases, and support your camera well or use a tripod. And...as always...macros are better on a cloudy day when you don't have a lot of contrast and shadows.5. The ISO quality is a great improvement over my P&S; SZ7, but not as good as my wife's Nikon D5100. But then, I didn't want the hassle of a SLR. So that's that, I guess.6. This camera feels good in the hand and seems to be very well built.7. The \"handheld night scene setting\" is cool.8. So far, I have not found that the HDR is all that great. I think I would rather bracket and use those photos with a computer-based HDR program.9. If you shoot anything with action, or you like to do fast shooting, a Class 4 SD card isn't going to work for you. You are going to have to move up to a Class 8 or 10 speed to take advantage of this camera's speed. Class 4 will slow you down as you wait for the card to load.10. The new, smooth panorama is absolutely fantastic.11. I love being able to shoot both JPEG and RAW at the same time. I've always wanted to learn RAW, and now I can do so while having the familiar JPEG too. I use Photoshop Elements sometimes - typically just to crop, adjust the levels a little, occasionally adjust a color cast, sometimes clone to get rid of power lines and such, and then unsharp mask (very lightly).12. The two custom white balance controls are very, very convenient and very easy to use. Thank you, Panasonic.13. Having four - check that - four - custom setting is mind blowing. I'm in heaven.14. I'm a little surprised that the scenes menu does not have a snow or beach setting. However, photographing on snow yesterday proved to me that the camera does not seem to need it. Using Program did great, and I suspect iA would do OK too. I forgot to try it. If there is a slight color cast, you can quickly use the color cast correction in any photo touch-up program. But the exposure on snow and sand, which are difficult for most cameras, is great.15. I have found that the Case Logic DCB304 recommended here is too small if you want to carry anything more than the camera. I sent it back and bought the Lowepro Adventura 140 which works very well for me. It has room for the FZ200, my P&S; ZS5, a little tripod, some filters and extra SD cards, and spare batteries for both cameras.It's still half the size and weight of the case my wife needs for her Nikon D5100 body and lenses.16. Dec 3, 2012 - Took a lot of photos at First Night on New Year's eve with the Handheld Night Photograph setting in the Scenes menu. I love it. What a fantastic option for nighttime photos. I also took a number of hand-held photos of lights etc. using the Program setting and they did quite well, though the ISO has to be set higher than 400 to do so. Then took a lOT of photos of a musical group at one of the local coffee shops under incandescent lighting, using both burst shooting and normal program mode. This camera does very well. It is fast - the F2.8 lens is really a great thing. I agree with other reviewers who say that this camera does not do as well with higher ISOs as the Nikon 5100, say. My wife has the D5100 and I can see the difference. But then, I'm not carrying around three lenses and a camera nearly twice as heavy and big as the FZ200. It's always a trade off and it depends on one's priorities. Just try to keep your ISO setting at 400 or below. (But see my additional comments below.)October 21, 2013: I've now taken 100,000+ images with the FZ200 and still love the camera. Some pointers: use the speed setting for long zooms and adjust the speed to the amount of zoom you are using. I find that adjusting the speed to 1300+ when zoomed to 600mm handheld nearly guarantees a sharp photo at that focal length. I shoot a lot from a rocking canoe, so it's not unusual that I need to set an even faster speed. I also set the exposure compensation about a full stop low and then bracket 2/3 of a stop. This gives me choices on editing and brings out the colors and reduces the ISO, which is important since this camera is noisy above 400 ISO. However...and I love this...the free program NoiseWare does a fantastic job of correcting the noise with my computer. With this program I don't worry much about noise. And...along the same lines...reduce the noise correction and sharpness correction to -2 in the Photo Style menu to reduce the occasional artificial look that comes from the internal software in this camera. You can play with the four setting in these menus to reduce some of the camera's unneeded internal software corrections.And listen up, Panasonic, if you monitor Amazon comments: You need to create a screen display item that reminds the user of the side lever setting. It's far too easy to set the focus for macro or manual and then leave it there when the camera is shut down. I've lost some good shots later because I didn't change the focus setting back to auto focus before shutting down and the lens was on the wrong setting. Another option is to reset the focus back to automatic upon shutdown as the default. It's easier to change the side lever than to remember the setting.PackJac", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Confused About Bridge Cameras? You Should Be!", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R4B1ATE6K0GMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Confused About Bridge Cameras? You Should Be!Much of the entire camera review area is horribly redundant. By that, I mean you often have 1) a cut and paste of a Press Release followed by a \"new article\" 2) a \"Hands on Preview\" which once again regurgitates the press release, perhaps some add copy, and is a meaningless non-review. Finally, maybe, 6 - 8 months later you might have 3) a review, or not. Many cameras never make it to 3), for they are already discontinued and new models are announced, as in the case right now in several areas.The bridge camera is supposed to bridge the divide between pocket cameras and system cameras, more or less. Yet, there is no consensus as to what that specifically means.Right now, PC Magazine has the new $699 Olympus Stylus 1 camera as its Editor's Choice SuperZoom. It is called a SuperZoom, although it is only a 10.7x optical zoom camera.  It replaced the Panasonic FZ-200 24x unit, that can now be had for $410 or even less. The Fujifilm X-S1 26x camera was beat out by the Panasonic. In October, 2012 (yes, way back then) the comment was \"At close to $800 the X-S1 is prohibitively priced for many buyers, which prevents it from ousting the Nikon Coolpix P510 as our Editors' Choice superzoom camera.\" By the way, you can now pick up the Fujifilm XS-1 for $350 delivered, if not less.This is one example of many sure to either bewilder people, or convince people that PC Magazine (and other sources) are completely bewildered. How can a 10.7x camera, in 2013, be a \"SuperZoom\" compared to a 24x, 26x, or 50x unit? How can a camera like the Fujifilm that retailed at $799 for a short while be overpriced, yet now the short-range Olympus is the best SuperZoom you can buy? As fast as you can change your socks, the best SuperZoom went from a 42x Nikon P510 to a 24x Panasonic FZ-200 to a 10.7x Olympus. A 10x zoom range camera is no super zoom: that range of non-versatility is handily exceeded by dozens of 20 - 24 x eight ounce pocket cameras.WHAT IS A BRIDGE CAMERA?The idea of a bridge camera is to give you more versatility, features, and flexibility than available in a shirt-pocket camera with one lens array: with less bulk, weight, and cost than going the D-SLR or other system camera route. One lens array means the sensor and processor can be optimized for that one lens. One lens means the unit is sealed to a certain extent, so no dirt will cover your sensor when changing lenses for example. A bridge camera should also net you an electronic viewfinder, better battery life than a point and shoot, and should be a lot more fun to carry than a system camera.THE BETTER BRIDGE CAMERAS, AND WHYFujifilm X-S1The  Fujifilm X-S1 is better built than most all of them, with a larger sensor than the common 1/2.33 arena sensors, and better image quality, in general, than small-sensor cameras. Currently, it is a screaming deal at $350 street. You might wonder why I don't use one, currently? Its images can be quite excellent:[...] . The barrier, for me, is its 2.1 lb. or so weight, just more than I want to carry all day. But, that's what you get if you want a larger sensor, lens, and metal dials and a tougher build. If the weight is not an issue, and a manual zoom appeals: it may well be your camera. The EVF of the XS-1 is comparatively huge at 0.47-inch, approx. 1440,000 dots. Many other popular cameras have dinky .21 inch EVF's . . . and that includes the Canon SX-50 and Panasonic FZ-200. The X-S1 is a case of \"be careful what you ask for, you just might get it.\" We say we want better build quality (more metal, less plastic) and we say we want larger sensors. The X-S1 provides both. The catch is, larger sensors require larger, heavier lens arrays, and better build quality means more weight as well. The XS-1 gives a lot of folks want they said they wanted, but it weighs about 75% more than some other bridge-class cameras . . . the additional weight and bulk being the main detriment, at least for my uses.Canon SX-50The Canon fills the frame when other cameras struggle. While the impressive 50x lens isn't the brightest, its sensor is spectacularly good for a small sensor: or at least the sensor / processor combination. Competitively priced currently at $329, its somewhat plasticy (also noisy and slippery) build makes the camera more fun to carry at about 1.3 pounds. The weight difference between this unit and the X-S1 is substantial, for the Fujifilm unit weighs over 60% more.Panasonic FZ-200A great, bright, constant 2.8 lens and blazing fast shooting performance is why you'd want this camera (now down to $409 as of this writing). Its 24x zoom range (600mm max focal length in 35mm equivalent) is less than half of the Canon SX-50 and the bargain-priced Fujifilm SL1000 50x camera ($250 or so), but 24x handles a lot of shooting opportunities and the digital \"Intelligent Zoom\" gets you to 48x if needed while still capturing quite enjoyable images. It is one of those rare cameras that is very good for both still images and video. I'm asked if the FZ-200 is \"okay for birding\" and wildlife. Vickie has answered that for us on Flickr. The LCD has a 3:2 aspect ratio. If you shoot in the \"7M EZ\" mode you have an image size good up to an 11 x 14 or larger, but now you can enjoy about a 30x optical zoom (actually, 29.4x) or a whopping 58.8x \"intelligent zoom.\" That's a 735mm (35mm eq.) focal length that covers a huge range of shooting scenarios, without resorting to the smart zoom / pure view / intelligent zoom versions of interpolation. For an SLR, a 600mm lens Nikon 600mm f/4.0G ED VR II AF-S SWM Super Telephoto Lens for Nikon FX and DX Format Digital SLR could set you back $9K or more. Not exactly an easy to carry, affordable option.CONCLUSIONAll three of these cameras (X-S1, SX-50, FZ-200) can be considered excellent. It isn't that one camera could be rationally picked as an easy winner, for all of them have the ability to do a fine job under many conditions. Price is invariably a factor, for you can always squander the extra cash on food, clothing, and shelter.If value is your primary concern, presently the $250 or so street price Fujifilm SL1000 is hard to beat. Its huge zoom range is the same as the bit more expensive SX-50, although the Canon is a slightly better unit for still images) if you need to fill the frame with a 1200mm 35mm equivalent focal length. The Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 16.2MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black) offers the most for the least dollars. In bright sun, there is no such thing as a truly great LCD. They all wash out to a certain extent, and an electronic viewfinder can save the day in those conditions. Surprisingly, the most inexpensive camera in this field, the Fujifilm SL1000, offers a 920K dot EVF and a 920K dot hinged LCD.The Fujifilm XS-1 has the best image quality in the field, and the best build quality as well. Now available at $350, it would be called a \"no-brainer\" by some. While I understand that, its roughly 2.2 pound weight is more than I want to carry all day and as I do take a lot of video, the manual zoom of the XS-1 is a negative for my purposes. It is the closest thing to a system camera replacement, unfortunately including weight and bulk.There is no right or wrong or \"correct\" answer for everyone, for you can have a lot of fun with all of these cameras. Although I still use a Canon SX-50 for stationary stills, the camera that does the most for me most of the time is the FZ-200. Here's why I prefer it.The FZ-200 is substantially lighter than the X-S1, it locks autofocus in extreme low-light situations (deer after sunset feeding in a field) where the SX-50 struggles. While its EVF is not as good as the X-S1, though small (.21 in.) it is far sharper than the SX-50 with 1.31 million pixels.The Panasonic FZ-200 spanks the SX-50 in video performance, focus speed, overall shooting speed and boot-up time, and has a panorama mode that the SX-50 (and Canon in general) refuses to implement. Its excellent video performance is complimented by excellent battery life (540 still shots). Video is invariably a big drain on batteries, as is cold weather, and both video and cold weather are common situations for me. The 120 fps 720p (lower HD) high speed video mode is superb. It is a 1/4 speed, smooth as glass, high-resolution playback. The same goes for the VGA (640 x 480) HS mode that is 240 fps: more than sufficient quality to analyze a golf swing with no post-processing.The constant F2.8 lens of the FZ-200 is no joke and it gives this camera the ability to function where other super-zooms cannot. Under well-lit conditions, there isn't much difference in image quality. Under ridiculously poor light, there is a huge difference.To compare, I took several pictures of an igloo-shaped doghouse in the snow after midnight using three representative cameras, all hand-held. A Panasonic FZ-60 lost its mind, and could not begin to focus. The Canon SX-50 whirred, clicked, struggled and told me to \"raise flash.\" It took an unrecognizable, muddy black image of nothing discernible. The FZ-200, however, locked focus instantly and grabbed an ISO 1600 image of the doghouse, zoomed in to fill the frame, with no issues. In this somewhat contrived example, it was the difference between an instant, usable image and no image at all.Not surprisingly, the demise of the digital camera market has been under-reported by most review sites, if it has been reported at all. Reuters summed things up on December 30, 2013, noting that Panasonic's camera sales have plummeted 40 percent from April to September. IDC expects a further drop in the market for compact cameras in 2014 of 40 percent. Whether you are selling hot dogs or hockey pucks, drops of 40 percent are not sustainable. Industry analyst Yu Yoshida mentioned, \"\"Only those who have a strong brand and are competitive on price will last -- and only Canon, Nikon and Sony fulfill that criteria.\" Panasonic with its tiny three percent and change of the market, along with Olympus and Fujifilm, are all considered vulnerable.While smartphone sales have sizzled, camera sales have fizzled. Unfortunately, the Micro 4/3 system cameras have not gained much traction, another ominous situation for Panasonic and Olympus.  Canon and Nikon own the SLR market, and powerful brand names (rightly or wrongly, perhaps sadly) is why many people buy what they do.The FZ-200, introduced over a year ago, is one of those rare cameras that won't go out of style anytime soon. The constant F/2.8 25mm-600mm lens is ground-breaking in a camera of this type, and remains so. Its 1,312,000 dot EVF is best of breed for a camera of this type and its video performance remains class-leading as well. Its 540 shot CIPA battery life is far best than most in this class, more than double of some. It is fast enough in focusing, fast enough in boot-up and shot-to-shot speed, with a fast enough lens to be able to capture images where most all bridge-type cameras cannot.It is the only camera that satisfactorily bridges three types of imaging devices: the simpler point and shoot, the system camera with multiple lenses, and the camcorder. Given unlimited funds, size, and weight you can of course find technically better imaging. Not so most could notice on a web page or an 8 x 10, though, and certainly not on shareable video files, either. It makes the FZ-200 its own class of camera: a very good class, to say the least. Though under many conditions, you can get quite pleasing images with several cameras, for a 1-1/4 lb. audiovisual standalone media powerhouse unit, the FZ-200 is the one to beat.Copyright 2013 by Randy Wakeman and Randy Wakeman Outdoors.For sake of completeness: I've always found Panasonic-labeled Chinese batteries to be a spectacular rip-off. I've been using Halcyon 1600 mAH Lithium Ion Replacement Battery for Panasonic Lumix FZ200 Digital Camera and Panasonic DMW-BLC12 and they are better than OEM.

The body on this is plastic and boy it feels cheap. I wish they would have put a little more quality in the body of it. With that said, this camera takes amazing pictures. I read a lot of reviews and comments on this camera about the smaller sensor having noise at low ISO levels. Well, it might but the pictures i took looked fantastic on my pc and even better when i viewed them on my TV. Good enough for me, that's all i need. I also have to say the controls are real easy to use and navigate through and there are a bunch of fun creative stuff you can do with the pictures such as monochrome, toy effect, high dynamic etc.. The viewfinder is digital so it is not smooth when you're panning with the camera, has a jittery effect to it. I changed the picture setting to 16:9 and it was a lot better to view through. If you can get past the cheap feeling body and the viewfinder you will find this camera excellent. I took some pictures outside and utilized the f2.8 aperture and noticed that the pictures were too bright. Lowered it to 5.6 and perfect! I never thought I'd have to worry about getting too much light for the picture. I also zoomed in fully  on a bunch of road signs and viewed them on my TV and they were perfect. I'm not gonna sit in front of my laptop and zoom in 100% and complain about noise and purple fringing etc... It does have some when you really look at it up close zoomed in but i'm not gonna point it out to people i show pictures to.I will be doing more testing with this camera but so far 5 stars for execution and quality of pictures. I just can't give this camera 5 stars because of the body feel and the viewfinder. if those two things were better then 5 stars for sure.** Update 11/20/2012Been doing a lot of picture taking the last couple days and keeping the tag on the camera in case i need to return it. No need for that because every picture i take has been excellent. It's amazing and such a pleasure to take a picture of something in the distance and get great clarity and color.My advice to anyone reading other reviews and getting discouraged by the image noise at high ISO levels needs to take a deep breath have a beer and stop pixel peeping. I mean every camera will have it at some point. Does this camera have more image noise when magnified then others? sure it does but it's not a high end dslr and for it's class it is one of the best. Thing is you really don't need high ISO levels with this camera because of the f2.8 aperture being wide open at any zoom range.Digital cameras will always have image noise at some point. They are not the quality of what cameras used to be in my opinion but they're flexibility to edit and retake a shot gives the user much more control. I looked at some of my older photos taken with a 35mm camera and they were so much better. Just the nature of digital photos that meakes them inferior.My only gripe is the feel of the camera, it really feels more like a toy because of the plastic body but if it takes good pics then i can deal with it.I think the menu system is easy to use and I am gettig quicker at setting what i want. It really takes some time to get to know the camera because it has so many customized settings. I am still not sure of a few of them but getting there. I think the camera is well worth the money and i'm going to be using it more and more as a go to camera.the pictures that Graham Loughton (that his name?) posted on YouTube  were stunning and people download and magnify and still complain. Geez, come on get a grip. Again i'll say if it looks good on my 52\" TV at 16:9 crop and on my laptop i am good to go here. Don't over analyze things too much, this camera gets great profesional reviews everywhere i have looked.With so many choices out there it is so confusing on what to buy but with this camera you get a very unique thing with the f2.8 at 600mm zoom which distinguishes it from any other camera.If you have to shoot in a darker area use a flash, that's what they are for but in most cases with this camera you can maintain a low ISO and get a fast shutter with the aperture at 2.8. There is no need to shoot at high ISO level with this camera anyway.Good luck everyone.** Update 11/23Ok I'm over the viewfinder and the cheap feel to it. I'm moving this to 5 stars. I took a boatload of pics today at the park because the weather was beautiful and had great results.Camera setting were Aperture Mode 4.0 - 5.6 (bright day) I set the scence mode to Scenery and bumped the saturation up +1 and noise reduction +1. I set the WB to Outdoor and results were fantastic.Only downside to all this was a fre pics taken anywhere from 500mm - 600mm were a bit noisy but otherwise no issues. Getting more comfortable with the camera as I go.** Update 12/23Just a quick update on this camera as i have been using it as my go to camera. I also use a Canon 60D and a Lumic G5. I have gotten very used to this camera and I have to say it is the best camera I have ever owned. The quality of the pictures this camera takes is incredible. I haven't been in SilkyPix at all to edit because there is no need to. There have been some negative feedback on the noise level with high ISO's and while they are mainly true that you don't want to go higher then ISO 800 (some say 400) you can limit this setting in the config menu. Now, the camera has some limitations under low lighting but for the majority of your pics you will be ok. It has it's limitation as most cameras in this grouping do. I will leave some links below to my shutterfly account to view pictures if you want. I have taken shots of the moon, sunsets and local parks here in North Carolina.I also want to mention that you can go to YouTube and view many tutorial videos by Graham Houghton to get more details on the camera. they are great and he does a great job.Shutterfly acct: [...]I stronlgy recommend getting this camera on Amazon, buy it if your on the fence and if you don't like it make sure the seller has a return policy so if you don't like it you can return it. I doubt you will.It is well worth the money.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Because It Sells For Under $600 The Lumix FZ200 Doesn't Get The Respect It Deserves!!!!", "Author": "Steven M. Frankel", "ReviewID": "R2MKNJ9UQLTWB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The title of this review says it all.  If a 25-600mm zoom with a constant f2.8 aperture was to be released by Nikon, Canon or Fuji with an excellent  electronic viewfinder, terrific handling and weighing in about 27 ounces  -- and it sold for $1600 -- it would be crowned as the Camera Of The Year and would be on allocation everywhere. Instead \"reviewers\" who have probably never used it for even a hundred shots are coming up with all those answers for why it can't be as good as it seems.Unlike most of the reviewers, I've used it for demanding work over the past two weeks; and it's yielded more than 1,000 photos without more than a dozen that represented a failure of the camera to do what I told it to do.  For proof, go to my website, [[...]] and to the gallery entitled:  \"12-8-31 CYC Race Start - Steve Frankel's Shots\".  It contains 189 photos I took last week from the committee boat at the start of the Wednesday Night Races sponsored by the California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey, CA.  Some shots are wide-angle but more were done at 200-600mm and most are razor-sharp.  This is despite all being shot from a rolling deck of a 38' boat and all being handheld.  To give you a reference for the quality, the gallery entitled  \"12-8-31 CYC Race Start - Glenn Daley's Shots\"were taken by a friend alongside me in the cockpit who was shooting with a Nikon D5100 with an 18-105mm f3.5-5.6 lens.  Since the photos were taken at the same time and with the same light, you can see that the Lumix doesn't give anything away to the Nikon on the shots which were taken at about the same focal lengths.  Of course, the really close telephoto shots that were taken by the Lumix could not be matched by the Nikon.Interestingly the third galley of yacht racing photos (2012 Yacht Race Photos) were taken about 2 months ago on a really rough evening, and these were all taken by my Olympus OM-D with the splash proof 12-50mm lens.  At twice the price of the Lumix, one would expect that the shots taken at similar focal lengths would have been sharper with the OM-D; but that was really not the case even when I blew up the best shots taken by each of the cameras up to 13\"x19\" enlargements.The only thing the Lumix doesn't have going for it are its size and a really wide aperture of indoor shooting.  I'm using my third camera, a Sony RX100, to fill this void.  Come to think of it, a FZ200 and a RX100 make an almost ideal combination and yet it costs less than the OM-D with the 12-50 zoom.  It's only when you equip the OM-D with 3 fixed focal length lenses ( I use the 14mm f2.5, the 25mm f1.4, and the 75mm f1.8 along with the 12-50mm zoom) ) that you can do even better than the FZ200/RX100 combo, but at that point you're comparing the $1250 combo to one which costs about $3000.In short, if you have want to have a cameral that will be close to ideal about 80% of the time, you can't go wrong with the Lumix.  Don't be taken in by the criticism of the small sensor size.  I don't know how Panasonic did it, but the photos at my website don't lie:  This camera has a terrific lens and body; if I were not afraid of accused of being sexist, I would say it's close to being a perfect \"10\"!", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "FZ200 An Outstanding Camera with an Amazing F2.8 Lens", "Author": "Roger James \"Doc\"", "ReviewID": "R1U6GUVD2P17Y4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The FZ200 is a spectacular camera that takes beautiful images and amazing video.  I've taken about 1000 images so far including images and videos at the zoo, botanical gardens, state fair, and a museum. The vast majority of images have come out sharp, and properly exposed. The camera was amazing in low light situations. I took many ISO 100 low light images which came out sharp and properly exposed all made possible by the F2.8 lens and amazing image stabilization.  All my images were hand held but looking at them on my 55 inch LCD screen; it looked as if a tripod was used.  I used the default settings in P mode, but most shots were in A mode, Aperture at F2.8 for low lighting. The F2.8 produced beautiful bokeh.  (Sharp subject with blurred background).  I raised the ISO in extra low light settings to keep exposure above 1/10 second, my limit for sharp hand held images. Many 1/3 second wide angle exposures were sharp.Even a beginner who has never taken an image could use this camera with great success and would advance much faster than buying an entry level dSLR with kit lens. This camera is lighter, faster and just better.  I also own and use a Canon 60D, Panasonic GH2 as well as some great subcompact cameras. When given a choice, I now want the FZ200 for images and video. The video from the FZ200 equals my higher end Panasonic digital camcorder so that is staying in the closet tooWhen the camera is set at F2.8, the bokeh is just wonderful and produced portraits that look almost professional.  Great image stabilization is critical in a zoomed lens especially at the far end. It does require bracing the camera as well as you can. I will use fences, trees, or lean against anything not moving which helps a lot.In the IA or P setting, the camera usually defaults to F3.5 or F4 which is the sharper part of the lens. I used the A mode most of the time because most of my shots were portrait, no action, low light, or macro. If I were to take an action shot the S mode would be best.I also own the Panasonic FZ150 camera which is a great camera too but does not have a F2.8 zoom lens.  Here are some of the improvements I in saw in the FZ200. There are many improvements.1.  Improved grip, its larger and holding the camera steady is easier with better button placement. Extra weight adds balance with the larger lens. It still uses 52 mm filters which are readily purchased and install.2.  The on/off switch is in now a lever switch on the mode dial like you find on dSLR. It's much better than the recessed on/off button; it opens up a space for an additional buttons.3.  Addition of more function buttons, a great feature and easily programed for various functions.4.  The video button is more pronounced and was moved into a position where it is very easy to move  your finger onto the video button without looking or moving the camera. It takes practice.5.  The flash switch is move pronounced, repositioned and much easier to switch on.6.  The mode dial is less cluttered with scenic mode in just one of the positions.7.  All the buttons are spaced further apart and have a positive feel (not so recessed)8.  Huge 24X F2.8 lens is F2.8 through 600 mm (35 film equiv) which is ground breaking for any camera.  Once you get used to F2.8 in a lens it is very difficult to go back to a camera or lens without it.9.  Larger battery means more images before recharging, could last the entire day. I haven't run out yet. On one day I shot 18 minutes of video and 450 images and still had \u00bd power on the meter. This exceeds the specification. I never used the flash except early on to test the camera which might have made a difference.  The flash does work well.10. More custom settings allowed. Many more and they can be reset each time if you desire.11.  Improved EVF.  It has many more pixels and with the F2.8 lens the image you see is very bright even in very low light. This is very helpful for image taking and video.12.  Very fast autofocusing.  Can set focus start for zoom or macro on lens side. Not instantaneous focus but fast. Fully zoomed lens in low light will produce some slowness while seeking focus.13.  Great Video and Audio, the camera microphone is slightly angled which is different than FZ150.14.  All the good stuff from the FZ150 has been retained. Mike and remote jack, lens hood, etcThis camera is aimed at photo enthusiasts, advanced amateurs, and beginners but not really professionals.  Professional will buy it for the F2.8 lens and use it for fun photography.Warning:  This camera is not a professional camera for many reasons which include:1. The camera is not moisture or rain proof2. The camera is not dust proof3. The F stop is limited from F2.8 to F8 which limits macro use and some landscape use.4. The camera is polycarbonate and not meant to be dropped ever or banged around.5. The total shutter lifetime is not known. Could last 10,000 or 100,000 clicks, who knows?The camera is not a professional camera, so what else is not perfect with the camera?1.  Its \u00bc pound heavier than previous model (from battery, grip and lens)2.  $100 higher price than previous model and competition (It's a steal at $500 and well worth $600)3.  Basic User Manual only a few pages and no full manual but full manual is on supplied disk.4.  Lens hood fits very tightly and it's a little hard to install, easier to remove.5.  Limited F stops on goes from F2.8 to F8 (limits macro work and some landscape images)6.  Manual Focus is very awkward. (You would want this to take pictures through windows and cages) and some macro pictures. DSLR lens are vastly superior for manual focus and better for macro work.7.  Macro images are good but not great. All super zooms have limited macro capabilities.8.  Not water proof, dust proof, and must be handled carefully (don't drop or impede lens)9.  Zoom does not extend to 50X like SX50is if you find that important.10. Interchangeable lenses will produce sharper images especially with a larger sensor camera.11. Small sensor limits low light capability and image sharpness. For a pro this matters.There are times that the light is so low you need to pump up the ISO. I took a number of test photos at the 3200 ISO and the extended 6400 ISO. It is noisy but does get in all the detail. An example, with 600 mm zoom for a page of type at 6 point, you could read the text but it might look like dot matrix. The focusing is very rapid but slows some in fully zoomed images especially in very low light. The images even at ISO 6400 may still require a very slow shutter speed if the light is extremely low.FZ200 Update 7/9/13  Works great and favorite go to camera. Read comparisons to other cameras I use.How does this camera compare to a dSLR's such as the Canon Rebel T4i or the Canon 60D? I own both of these cameras and believe the dSLR image quality is superior to the FZ200 which is not unexpected because of the larger sensor and high quality lens available. The camera will provide better low noise at higher ISO and is vastly superior in macro photography, a weak point with the FZ200. The T4i has a touch screen interface on the LCD which we might see in a future upgrade to the FZ series. The dSLR has a much smaller focusing point allowing great images at the Zoo right through the cage.  It's possible to manually focus the FZ200 but it is not that easy or as fast. The dSLR will produce nice video but the video taken though the EVF on the FZ200 is much easier and produces better video at all zoom levels. For video the FZ200 is the superior camera, for images and macro is the dSLR is better.How does the camera compare to Micro 4/3 cameras with an EVF like the FZ200? These include cameras the Panasonic GH2 or the Olympus OMD-EM5?  These cameras have larger sensors than the FZ200 but smaller than dSLR's, the camera size and weight are very similar to the FZ200.  I have used and own both of these cameras and they rival the dSLR in capabilities. The Olympus OMD has an EVF and in body image stabilization like the FZ200 but is smaller and has all metal body and weather sealing which make the camera a little heavier than the FZ200. This camera also produces outstanding images with great low light capability and better macro than the FZ200. The video is much less capable. This camera is 2X to 3X in price and is geared to the photo enthusiast and is much more complicated to setup and use. The Panasonic GH2 and GH3 are also very capable cameras and excel at video and can produce camcorder quality or better.  It is priced at 2X to 3X the price of the FZ200.  Both camera use interchangeable lenses as well as use dSLR lenses with adaptors. They take great images and are better at low light images than the FZ200. They are good alternatives to dSLR's with a good selection of lenses. You could easily spend over $2000 to get the range of zoom you get already included with the FZ200.The Panasonic FZ200 seems to have taken the most important and critical features found in the dSLR and MFT (micro four thirds) cameras, including the in body image stabilization and EVF of the MFT, size and shape of small dSLR without the weight, many dslr like functions for customization and added a F2.8 super zoom lens at an affordable price. What was left out is expensive stuff like metal body, weather sealing, unlimited customization, and large sensor. These items while nice for the enthusiast or pro are overkill for the 95% of us that want to have fun taking good quality images and video and still have money left to pay the mortgage.Finally, which is my favorite camera....It is the FZ200 because it is the most fun and easy to use and takes images and video that rival the other cameras. The FZ200 makes photography enjoyable and just about anyone can pick this camera up and immediately take great images and video.The bottom line is that the FZ200 is a significant upgrade over the FZ150. Read all the reviews and try the camera out if you can find it anywhere. The issues some people reported, which included noise even at ISO 100 could have been a defective camera or failure to set camera properly. I never saw the noise that was mentioned until the images were viewed at over 200%. Overall it is an easy and fun camera to use and considering all that's included is a good buy even at it's retail price. However the price does vary so be patient and you can save up to $100 at various times.If the camera has a weak point it is the small sensor, consumer build, and compromise F2.8 zoom lens that Panasonic brilliantly software corrected to produce a high quality image. (My best guess) This was a great purchase and I'm glad I bought the camera and you will too.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than the FZ150", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R48DSMTGUXS5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My conclusion so far is that the FZ200 images are clearly sharper than those from the FZ150. It's also much better in low light conditions.  I have a great picture of a magnolia blossom from about 8 feet away and you can see the individual hairs on the stem.  The FZ200 does weigh more than the FZ150. By sharp I mean when a. Viewed in review mode on the camera LCD using zoom, b. Viewed on a 27inch Dell HD monitor at about 12inches, and c. When printed on a Canon iP100 which has a decent resolution.Other things I like:-The higher resolution EVF which I use when shooting makes composition easier (I only use the LCD for menu changing/reviewing pictures). It works quite well actually, because when the LCD is closed up face in, the EVF comes on.-Same 52mm filter size.-Same camera case fits although the FZ200 is a little larger than the FZ150.-Same cables.-Larger capacity battery.-The new FZ200 body is slightly taller than that of the FZ150 so there is more thumb room on the right side of the LCD, especially useful when holding the FZ200 in one hand while standing in a pop top safari van.-The FZ150 was great as a safari camera, and this one is even better.-iZOOM now gives an additional 2X magnification. If you are concerned about the potential reduction in image quality (after all there is no free lunch), you can either stay out of the iZOOM area using the ZOOM bar at the bottom of the screen or if using P mode simply turn iZOOM off. I tried a few repeat tests (handheld) shots using iZOOM and they looked great at 48X. Useful on safari for rare shots (maybe 1 in 400) where 24X just isn't enough.-I don't use flash and it's not allowed in many galleries and museums, so it's nice that it has to be mechanically switched on, and not on by default at power on. Not much new here versus the FZ150.Things I didn't like:-My unit makes a slight random buzzing noise when just sitting there, not sure what that is yet. Seems to be in present in record mode only. Since it might show up on the sound track and also shorten the battery life I am going to return it and get a replacement. Update: I found that the second unit behaved the same, and since I have to crank the volume up to the max to hear it on the audio track (where I can also hear my breathing) I decided it isn't a problem. The second unit is virtually the same as the first one as far as IQ, so that's encouraging.-There is less room between the grip and the lens barrel, so I can no longer have the lenshood stored backwards without scrunching my fingers. I found this useful for hiding the chrome and other flashy stuff around the lens. Plan to NOT carry a lens hood now as I seldom if ever use one.I suggest the photo review au FZ200 review for assessing performance, and comparing with other cameras i.e. G1X, FZ150, RX100, etc. I set up 2 reviews in windows next to each other, for comparing each section.(My FZ200 equipment list is much the same as before-no tripod, no lens hood, Nikon 52mm clear filter for lens protection, Crumpler The Noose wrist strap, Rip Off's Belt Pouch, and one spare battery in pants pocket).", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lumix FZ-200 - Very Pleased with Images & UI", "Author": "D. alexander \"DMA\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1INXQVD6QXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little background. I started taking pictures in 1966 with a Pentax Spotmatic. Then I moved up to a Canon A-1. I began with Ektachrome then Kodachrome then switched to Kodacolor ISO 200 film. I took between 5,000 and 10,000 film photos over this period. In 2006  I migrated to a Sony DSC H5 then in 2011 to a Sony DSC HX100 and now, September 2012, to the Lumix FZ-200.The Sony H5 was a great camera for the time and I got wonderful pictures from it, but by 2011 it was definitely behind the times. I expected the Sony DSC HX100 to be a big improvement in image quality. It wasn't. While it had many bells and whistles -- panorama, HDR, burst mode, movies -- the quality of the pictures was not what I had hoped or expected.The Lumix is everything I had hoped that the DSC HX100 would be, and more. I get two more F-stops or shutter speeds at long zoom compared with the Sony, that is, F 2.8 vs. F 5.6 in high zoom settings. The autofocus is better. The anti-shake is much better. The HDR is better. The picture-to-picture cycle time is two or three times faster. The quality of the images' color balance, contrast, lighting, and dynamic range are all better.Additionally, the Lumix has a UI design and some nice features that makes it much easier for me to use. For example, the optical zoom is 24X and you can increase that via a digital zoom to 48X. Panasonic implements the digital zoom by showing a zoom bar in the very high res viewfinder. This bar tells you when you have hit the 24X max but the camera lets you automatically continue zooming into the 24X to 48X range without doing anything. You just keep zooming and the camera seamlessly switches on the digital zoom.Yes, this degrades the picture quality but if you are in the woods and are trying to get a picture or just see some animal several hundred feet away this automatic activation of the digital zoom is a real plus.I took a picture of the same scene at the same time from the same place with both the HX100 and the FZ-200 and imported both to Photoshop. I drastically zoomed both by the same amount and displayed them side-by-side. The image from the 12 MP Lumix was slightly sharper than the image from the 16MP Sony. And, to me, the color and lighting looked better on the Lumix image.Everything just seems easier on the Lumix, macro photos, focus under difficult conditions, camera controls, etc. I can't say whether the Lumix is better than, say, the new Canon Powershot SX 50. I do know that numbers on a spec sheet don't tell the whole story.I can say that the Lumix is the best camera I have ever owned, that it is easy to use, easy to carry, fast, takes great pictures and that I find the controls easy to master and use.I have no reservations about giving the FZ-200 five stars.", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Zoom, OK RAW, VERY poor JPEG.", "Author": "Shadow \"Shadow\"", "ReviewID": "R7NVVKDH0CDIT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In general, the camera is O.K. for the price, especially with the 600mm f/2.8 zoom which is an engineering milestone.  It is small and very usable.  However, the in-camera JPEG engine is worthless.  It is VERY noisy with JPEG.  I have to shoot them in RAW, and get that converted using Lightroom 4.2 RC.  At the end, I use the camera to take photos, but the photos came out just OK with too much noise and lack of details.  Very frustrating to me that it can view but not taking great photos.  With this limitation, any forced JPEG modes (i.e. special effects, AI and AI+, etc) usefulness will be very limited.  (Panasonic, if you are reading this, please release a firmware ASAP to fix this.  And please release updated codec for the FZ200's RW2)  I have used Lumix cameras for the past 7 years, but this is a major disappointment that I returned this camera.With that said, the zoom of the camera is amazing. The size is small for the zoom range while it is not a compact camera.  Considering that lens alone from other brand of 600mm @ f/2.8 can easily cost many times more than the price of this camera (e.g. a Canon 600mm F4 lens alone is $13K and more than a foot long)!  The FZ200's stabilization at 600mm is very, very good.  If you are looking for a camera for vacation, this is a good choice due to size and zoom.  However, if you need fine details or for any indoor shoots, it may not be the one.Pros:. The focus and zoom are very, very good.  The image stabilization is excellent even at the far end of the zoom.. Video is very good especially with the f/2.8 constant lighting.. The Fn buttons are nice, and they are re-programmable.. The extra Zoom button on the left is nice.. Many modes (3D, miniature, etc) and features with the camera (if you can stand the noise)Cons:. The in-camera JPEG is hopelessly aggressive and full of artifice.  I MUST shot in RAW, otherwise, the photos are not usable. (-1 star). The RW2 format is different from prior version.  (Panasonic, if you are reading this, PLEASE make sure that software vendors have already implemented your codec before releasing the camera.  I needed to download the Lightroom 4.2 Release Candidate to get that to work with the photos)  And No, I don't want to use your Silkpix. (-1 star). The AI is poor (It tends to wash out), and coupled with forced JPEG mode with AI or AI+, this mode is useless to me. (-1 star). Although, it has great zoom @ 12mp.  The fine detail resolution at the far end of the zoom is very poor.. A bit of noise - even at lowest ISO 100 and cannot get anything below ISO 100.. The noise level is significantly visible above ISO 400.. ISO 800 starts to see very pronounced smearing and lack of details.  At 1:1, it is not usable.. The dynamic range is a bit narrow..

Definitely a keeper.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "A  Marvel - Best Bridge Camera At ANY Price.", "Author": "Peter Suslock", "ReviewID": "R2RBAEYPNOOGLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To say that I am an amateur photographer is an under statement. A point and shoot guy for over 40 years, half of which I never knew which side of the camera to look through.As I am being dragged into the 21st century I decided it was time to invest in a decent camera. Plus I was at the point where if I researched one more camera my brains were going to pour out of my ears.I've had my eye on the FZ200 since it's pre-release. Yet I kept putting the purchase off and instead bought the under-rated Fujifilm X-S1 which is an excellent camera however the feature set, Image Stabilization and dazzling low light performance of the FZ200 beats the Fuji hands down - as it does with any other Bridge camera in this price range.I had also considered the following:1) An entry level DSLR the Nikon D3100 or the Canon T3i 22) Out of the Bridge cameras I had narrowed it down to  a few but the Panasonic FZ200 was always my first choice. Not only is it insanely popular it won Cnet's coveted Editors Choice award. The review by senior editor Josh Goldman is well worth watching if you're considering this camera or even if you already own it, the review has value.I have great admiration for Panasonic products, aside from our televisions I have a Panny Professional AG - HMC40 Video camera. I mention this because the Tech support from Panasonic has been so stellar. For me, this is a key issue, if there's a problem these folks will take all the time needed to help you out - a rarity these days.During a trouble shooting session with the video cam (which is a different department) I made it a point to talk with the Panny Tech about the FZ200 luck was in my favor as the Tech in the Pro department not only had a soft spot for the FZ200 he was happy to answer any questions I had. At one point during our conversation he told me -  \"Look, you won't learn this camera in a few days or even weeks - period. that's just not going to happen. Use the manual as a reference and most of all, start shooting in IA mode and see how you do\"It was great advice.I have spent hours taking pictures of our Bulldogs romping outside- over 200 photographs. The photos with exception of a just a few are spectacular. Crystal clear, wonderfully rich and sparkling with vibrant true to life colors - I was dazzled.Normally I would be in Corels Paintshop Pro or Adobe Lightroom for hours just trying to reduce the noise and blur but these images were pristine. Harley our oldest bulldog was born to play soccer. That said, because the recovery time between shots and focusing is so lightening fast the \"action\" shots of him playing, running, moving his gargantuan orange ball around were perfect, so perfect even caught in mid air. The images are blur free - it was hard to believe I had taken them.This camera is blazing fast.Low light conditions is where the FZ200 really shines. Pictures in dim lighting come out rich and clear. I've never had a camera perform so well in near dark conditions and that's without using the flash. The Feature set is sensational. The camera has so many intriguing built in filters and modes such as Miniaturize, old movie. Sepia and other creative modes it's a bit overwhelming. On most other cameras I tend to think most of these are gimmicky as there's nothing you can't do in Photoshop if you're so inclined. However, the feature set is so rich and really does provide options you'll want to actually use.  The camera is free of what is the equivalent of novelty bloatware.As I was really comfortabe with the Manual Zoom on my Fuji X-S1 I wasn't sure how I would like the auto Zoom but it's terrific. Smooth as silk, accurtae and completely silent. The view finder is excellent as well and surprisingly I found myself preferring this over the LCD screen.  As for the LCD The articulation is great. Plus there's very little wash out in direct sunlight so it's always easy to read - it's nice and bright.Some First Impressions:* Built like a Tank. Although it's plastic whereas the before mentioned Fuji is an all metal body with a rubberized coating - it's still a solid machine. Nice weight and fits in the hand beautifully.* The lens is one beautiful piece of glass. The auto zoom is surprisingly accurate.* Lot's of ports. Including one for an external Mic, and an HDMI cable.* Full HD video at 1080 dpi plus built in stereo mic/speakers.* Intuitive menu for easy set up - but still LOT'S to learn, especially for a novice as myself.* Pop up flash which according to Panasonic is more than adequate up to a range of 6-10 feet indoors and out. If you're further away say, sitting up in bleachers, you'll need an external flash.* Speaking of external flashes the camera has a Hot ShoeThe entire package arrives beautifully presented. The glossy black box includes the camera of course, The battery (which takes a first 4 hour charge) a charger and power cord, a quality neck and shoulder strap, Spring loaded lens cap which fits good and tight, USB transfer cable, Manual which is surprisingly easy to understand and follow, a CD ROM with a PDF version of the both an extended manual and Silky-Pics editing software (my copy wouldn't install on any computer) registration card and some additional paper work mostly safety and care related.As for the Image Stabilization it's nothing short of a technological marvel.At the heart of Panny's patented system is a \"floating\" lens which responds immediately to any movement of the camera or hand shake. It's response time is lightening fast and does a flawless job eliminatating blur. Even at full zoom without a tripod the images are wonderful. The FZ200 is as impressive looking as the photo's it's taking are beautiful.In hind sight a DSLR would have driven me crazy lugging around all those lenses that cost more than the camera itself the FZ200 is just a superb alternative.** Back to low light performance for one moment.A blinking message on the LCD will warn you if you need to use the flash. I was totally un-aware of this feature. We had some friends over the other evening and everyone was out in the sun room which was only lit by a cluster of candles.I played around with the setting modes and while leaving the camera on IA I chose \"steady hand held nigh shot\" and used the flash with red eye reduction. The images knocked me out. I did brighten some a little in Paint Shop but this was a matter of personal taste. The flash provides superb fill light and you don't get that stark, harsh light I've experienced with other past and present cameras.**** IMPORTANT TIP*******If you're considering this camera or already own it. I urge you to log onto youtube and search out many of the excellent reviews and tutorials. I highly reccomend a gentleman out of the U.K named Graham Houghton. Graham has an entire series of videos dedicated to the FZ200. It's a superb soup nuts insight into each feature with lessons ranging from the basics to using and learning full manual settings.He doesn't work for Panasonic - he just adores this camera! It's in every way a labor of love and a huge beneft for FZ200 owners. It's virtually a free in depth course in photography put in laymen's terms and frankly was yet one more compelling reason I purchased the camera. He has educational videos on virtually everything this camera can do and puts it in easy to understand steps.This camera continues to blow me away, the build quality, the intuitive menus and most of all the incredibly vivid photographs. Folks far more advanced than I have written reviews that explain the aspects of both photography and the FZ200 far better than I am able to do. However I can offer this to you. The FZ200 is making me a better photographer and I've just begun to scratch the surface - if it can do this for me, without question it can do the same for you.Highest Recommendation!", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expectations: Noise and Diffraction", "Author": "Peter Besenbruch", "ReviewID": "R23ZS7T588PX0V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Lot's of people like the FZ200, myself included, but a vocal minority do not. Complaints usually have to do with noisy images, especially JPGs. Primarily this is due to the small sensor, and that Panasonic tried to reduce the severity of its noise reduction. Its \"average\" is another company's \"low.\" The sensor is your typical 1/2.3\", found on countless point and shoots. This particular sensor comes with 12 mega-pixels. Others on the market come with 16.That's a high pixel density. High density means fewer photons striking the chip, necessitating an increase in gain. More gain means more noise. The \"quietest\" camera I have ever worked with was a 6 mpix. Canon Digital Rebel. At ISO 100 there was no noise, just perfect smoothness. The chip was considerably larger (it was APS-C sized); the individual sensors on the chip received more photons; gain was low.I replaced it with a 10 mpix. Canon Powershot SX10IS. Pixel peep this thing's images, and you get ugly: Noise and smoothing artifacts galore. Fortunately, I realized in advance what I was getting into. I dropped the mega-pixels down to 6, and the noise largely went away. Pixel peep an image at this reduced resolution, though, and you will see rougher gradations and actual grain. It couldn't match the smoothness of the DSLR. None-the-less, I found the camera acceptable. I got spoiled by the ability to zoom from 28-560mm in a smallish package.The FZ200 is slightly larger than the SX10, but the same comments apply. If you want less noise, shoot at lower resolution, or get a camera with a physically larger chip.There is another issue, one that most people fail to notice: Diffraction. All optical systems have it, and this is primarily related to the size of the optics. Bigger is better. The bigger the optics, the smaller the diffraction effects. The smaller the f-ratio at a given focal length, the smaller the diffraction. Assuming well made optics, diffraction is what limits the resolution of a lens. The smaller the diffraction effects, the better the resolution. The onset of the diffraction limit is gradual. Low contrast detail is the first to go, followed by the ability to resolve high contrast detail.With point and shoot cameras, the lens often lacks the resolution to take advantage of the density of the chip inside. That is true of the SX10. At 10 mpix., you can only hope to achieve the chip's resolution at 28mm. As you zoom towards telephoto, the f-ratio of the lens increases, like on most point and shoots. Using widely available diffraction calculators, I estimate that even shooting at 6 mpix., I probably don't get much resolution benefit beyond 300mm.Consider the FZ200. At 12 mpix., you start running into diffraction effects at f2.4. You start noticing them in the loss of low contrast detail at about f3. High contrast detail starts suffering at about f3.6. The FZ200, with its f2.8 lens can take advantage of most of the density of the chip throughout its zoom range. At 8 mpix., you can take some advantage of the resolution, even at f4. At 5 mpix., that extends to f5.6.Compare this with the current model Canon SX50HS, which has a 24-1200mm zoom, ranging from f3.4 wide angle, to f6.5 at the long end. At 12 mpix., with an f3.4 exposure, the SX50 will yield an image with most of the subtle detail gone. Zoom this thing, and your pixels come up increasingly empty. At 5.9 mpix., the camera can take full advantage of the lens at wide angle only. At 1.9 mpix., you still run into diffraction issues at 1200mm.You pay a lot of money for an FZ200. You pay for the lens. Ah, the lens: It gives you greater resolution, especially at the telephoto end. It gives you greater light grasp, allowing you to shoot at lower ISOs. Lower ISOs mean lower noise. You get to play more with depth of field. F2.8 blurs the background; with a 1/2.3\" chip, f5.6 brings much of the image into focus.In a camera world with increasingly wild camera claims, the FZ200 stands out as a fairly honest camera. It actually delivers most of what the specifications promise. Such cameras are getting hard to find.Update 21 October, 2013: I have kept dialing back the sharpening and the noise reduction settings. They both are now set at -2 (the lowest setting). The camera is quite sharp at these settings, as the lens can truly deliver the resolution at these settings. Unless I am shooting distant bird shots, I shoot at 8 megapixels, varying the aperture between f2.8 and f3.5.I wish the camera had an ISO 50 setting, as the camera will not shoot faster than 1/2000 of a second using aperture priority, or the \"P\" setting. If I shoot at 12 megapixels, I want to shoot at full aperture, but I find I frequently need a faster shutter speed. Changing to shutter priority yields 1/3200 of a second, which almost does it. It's a bit of a clunky arrangement. So, I stay at 8 megapixels, two megapixels higher than my SX10IS, and a get great deal more resolution than those extra pixels would indicate.

The magnificent f2.8 aperture was the closer. I have never seen such quality in a small sized 12.1 MP format camera.

My first JPEGs were bright and sharp enough for my tastes and the ability to capture both JPEG and RAW at the same time is a really nice feature.

I have owned several Panasonic and other brand pocket size super-zoom cameras. I always liked the Panasonic user interface, but what sold me was the F2.8 aperture that works across the full zoom range. My pocket super-zoom let me get close, but the larger lens let me get shots that stood out with details that my own eyes couldn't see.I bought the FZ200 just before a four thousand mile road trip from Texas to the Grand Canyon and back. I used a SLR years before and knew how much of a hassle they were, and I probably could have used my existing pocket super-zoom for the trip, but I wanted some pictures that would last a life time, not just good enough to post online. Lets just says that I didn't only get a few shots to last a life time, but nearly every shot was good enough to print. This camera does NOT disappoint when it comes to light sensitivity and lens speed.The first test for the camera was a big one. High up in Cloudcroft, NM on a moonless night take photos of the stars. Much harder then you would expect. Over the course of a few hours I got some amazing night photos, and managed to get a photo of the Milky Way without needing a star tracker or editing software. The next test for the camera was less then a hundred miles away: Take photos of the blindingly bright White Sands, NM. The camera managed to catch details in the sand that my own eyes were too blind to see.Over the course of the trip I learned how to use nearly every feature the camera offered. I used the F2.8 lens to capture low-light photos in Carlsbad caverns. The huge zoom to take photos of the moon, wild and zoo animals, and the wide angle portion of the lens to take epic panoramas of the Grand Canyon. The controls on this camera make changing to your favorite settings a breeze. One setting I would use for mixed shadow/light shots, another to focus-track fast moving animals, and then switch instantly to another to catch that high-zoom detail shot.Enough about the experience that photography helps preserve, now onto the actual camera.The camera is much lighter then I expected. In fact I ordered a SLR Gorilla-Pod, which I had to exchange for the Hybrid model as the camera is no where near as heavy as an SLR. Despite the light weight, it feels very solid. There is no creaking in the body (which is mostly metal). The controls are all tight and responsive. The lens itself moves very smoothly and quietly.The battery life on the camera was amazing, I needed to change the battery only after taking hundreds of shots. I didn't feel the need to constantly turn the camera off the save power. I never needed more then two batteries for a whole day of shooting.I found myself using the eye piece more then the LCD when outside. The LCD was visible even in bright light, but at full zoom it is very hard to aim and stabilize the camera using the LCD. The rotating LCD however is a back saver when working with a tripod, no need to crouch down to see the screen.The FZ200 really helped me to enjoy the process of setting up a perfect shot, without taking so long to setup that you miss the magical moment.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review from a non camera person, and a warning", "Author": "Rocco", "ReviewID": "R14CC7V9V69HFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife recently dropped her camera and broke the lens.

It's not Hollywood quality, but it's quite good non the less ( HD)LCD is bright, and pleasantly usable in bright sun light - much better than prior digital cameras that I've usedThe one weakness of the camera is the small sensor and the noise you will get at high ISO settings - really not good if you go above 400 ISO.  You probably won't run into that type of scenario often however as most of the time pics will be in the 100-200 ISO setting.  You can also set camera to prevent going into very high ISO settings - which is what I did, setting it to max 400 ISO and thus noise is quite limited.The advantage of the smaller sensor however, is the small size of the camera (relatively small that is).

I have been through many cameras over the past 50 years.  So far, this is the best combination of all features I would ever want.  I started enjoying the panorama option as well as the various filters and special effects available.  The burst rate is fantastic for capturing my kids' sports activities.  The movies are first-rate HD.  I have not used the slo-mo features yet.  Strongly recommend getting a 52mm UV, or other, filter just to protect the lens.  In summary, I can see why this camera was chosen as the best in its class for 2012 by many reviewers.  Suggest that a  backup battery be purchased.  Only drawback so far is getting used to taking macro shots which takes lots of practice.Since my first review, almost a year ago, I had a chance to compare the FZ200 against some of the latest DSLRs (such as the Nikon D7100 and Canon 70D). There's no comparison!  While I was able to occasionally get slightly sharper images with the D7100 (under some circumstances) there is question that the portability of the FZ200 and its outstanding zoom and many features easily trump the competition.  I found the ability to artistically modify/convert the pictures within the camera, AFTER taking a picture, to sepia or monochrome or toy effect or many others, terrific.  The panorama feature is also excellent making it seem as if you have even a wider angle lens.About 50% of my pictures are taken in the 'P' mode with fully extended zoom (2400mm equivalent?) with excellent results.  I also use this P 96x for taking close up shots instead of the macro feature with equal or better results.  This way you don't have to be on top of some flower or insect to take the pic.Strongly recommend you view Graham Houghton's many tutorials on YouTube to take advantage of the FZ200.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Traded my T4i", "Author": "L. Smith", "ReviewID": "RQDK3RI6Z49QI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A couple of years ago, I purchased a Canon SX40 HS to film my kids at sporting events. I liked the camera a lot, and decided to kick up my camera game to the DSLR arena with a Canon T4i. I ended up having an 18-135mm, a 55-250mm, and a 50mm 1.8. They all fit nicely into this medium-sized backpack I purchased as part of the deal here on Amazon. It took great pictures. Well after a few months, I found myself grabbing my cheap point & shoot to use at all the games because, having to warm up the kids with pitching, catching, etc., I didn't want to babysit a $1200 backpack-o-gear. I also hated changing the lenses in a dusty environment. I decided to sell the whole setup and get another super zoom.Having researched quite a bit, I vacillated between the SX50HS and this Lumix fz-200 for some time. The Canon was quite a bit cheaper, but the miracle that is the Leica 2.8 lens won out for my purposes (mainly baseball/softball and outdoor sports).  Its been a month, and I am very pleased with the performance at this price point. A 2.8 600mm lens will run well over $10K for the T4i (plus it weighs a ton), yet here is one on  a bridge camera. I have been able to get some really nice shots of action in somewhat dwindling outdoor light, and my kids love doing super-slow motion videos (great for at bats). The video is superior to the T4i IMO, but only because I had a non STM lens, and the autofocus noise drove me crazy (videos were unwatchable); make sure you get STM with a T4i or higher. The 120 fps video is very clear @ 720p, while the 240fps is still MiniDV quality and good enough to show an umpire his mistakes ;). Indoor video of family has been decent at regular speed - although slo mo will have to be outdoors. I also will say the you tube series from Graham H. is a must see for all owners - just set it like he does and you will be fine. I use shutter priority and high speed video the most.Please note, however, that the body is not as nice as the T4i body - and this can be understood with the cost of the Leica lens. I like the grippy rubber of the T4i over the slick smooth gray plastic with somewhat chintzy bright work of the FZ. I also find the lens cap and strap inferior to the Canon DSLR, but I have a 52mm HOYA filter to protect the lens (plus it screws right on without an adapter). I picked up the metalgear leather everready case for it, and now I grab a much smaller accoutrement for my photog adventures. I know the sensor is much smaller (which does result in more image noise for sure), and a Panny is probably looked down on by photo snobs (though Leica isn't). I just want a bunch of shots of my kids in various situations, and this camera makes that a very easy task to achieve.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I bought this to replace my Canon 40D", "Author": "Br David Chris Klecker", "ReviewID": "R1WWXDT5R0KT2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "...and I don't regret it.

I'm not saying the pics from the FZ200 were \"terrible\", but I couldn't deal with the color issue and was disappointed to find image quality more on par with my old 8 megapixel Canon and not as good as the other cameras in the comparison, all of which are much less expensive (the FZ200 was $599 when I got it).  Perhaps I got a bad unit--I might try another one just in case that's what happened, but I think I'll wait until it's been on the market for a while--see if they make any adjustments regarding color accuracy and JPEG quality.Added October 4, 2012I stopped at National Camera Exchange and with their help, compared the image quality of the FZ200 with another less expensive camera (the Canon SX500 IS--just $299 at Amazon).  Much to their surprise, they too found that when enlarging the JPEG image, the little Canon had better image quality than the FZ200.  They then compared the FZ200 with the Canon SX40 HS and the Nikon P5100, and found JPEG image quality better on those cameras as well.Hopefully Panasonic will come out with a firmware update that will fix the color and image quality/resolution issues.  In the meantime, my personal opinion is that the FZ200 belongs more in the mid $400 range.

Leica does not make a digital SLR, so I have a Canon 30D with two f,2.8 constant aperture zoom lenses, at over $1000 each. My FZ-200 Lumix does at least as well, and has more reach.My introduction to the super-zoom compact DSLR was the Lumix FZ 150. I stopped carrying the Canon on trips, and then stopped using it except for available light in family situations and some parties.  The problem is that the FZ 150's zoom dims down to around f, 5.6 at the longer focal lengths; no use in dim light. Even at 90mm equivalent, it was down to f, 4.5. Forget indoor available light photos except for posed portraits. This is the experience with all other digital zoom cameras I have used: You can't do low-light photos except at the wide angle setting, and even then, it's a slow f,3.5.Now comes the FZ 200. F,2.8 from wide angle to telephoto with a Leica lens that has an unbelievable 24X optical zoom. At under $500, compared to what I paid for the f,2.8 Canon SLR lenses, it's a steal. Plus RAW images, really fast autofocus, 5 and 12 FPS and full manual capability. It does everything a \"real\" digital SLR can do, with far less weight and expense.I can't say enough good things about the FZ200 after 4 months and 2 trips. It simply does everything. The power of the zoom in such a compact camera, with such low-light capability, is truly impressive. Autofocus is critical at large aperture in low light, and the focus has always been right on. Although I miss an optical viewfinder, this electronic one is detailed enough to be really useful.I have an external flash that's used for bounce flash indoors. This is why having a hot shoe is important.Then there is the video capability, again in low light you can use the better light gathering to do indoor movies not possible with other cameras.Last, there is the incredible swivel viewfinder on the back. You can place the camera at any angle and still get a clear view of what the image will be as you look at it from wherever you happen to be - on the side, above or below the camera.Five stars is the least this camera deserves.

I am still finding my way around the many features.  The lens is stellar with little perceptible distorion and crisp focus across the entire zoom range.  Low light capapbility is also excellent and I was able to capture action shots at a rodeo in evening shade, that I didn't think any camera could manage.  It has also taken good shots of flying birds against the sky - a subject that is almost impossible to properly expose with most cameras.  I particularly like the thumbwheel for quick access to exposure control and the easy method of switching between normal, macro and manual focus on the side of the lens.  High Dynamic Range mode, where the camera takes three bracketed exposure shots and combines them to reduce washed out highlights and deep shadows works exceptionally well for dramatic landscapes.  I got some truly exceptional photos in Yellowstone and Teton that would otherwise have had washed out skies and silhouette trees.  I also like the panorama mode, which actually works to produce a decent panorama shot quickly and in-camera! - unlike prior implementations from Panasonic and others I have tried to use.The only issues I have come across so far are:1. The minimum aperture is too large for a camera with such a big lens.  I tried to take long exposure shots of falling water to get that 'misty' effect and could not do it - the lens just captures too much light.  I need to get some neutral density filters to address this.2.  If you're carrying the camera from outdoors to indoors, etc., you have to remember to remove the hood before taking any flash photos as it casts a shadow - and if you use the camera with the hood in the reversed, storage position (great idea BTW) it can pinch your fingers as the lens moves.3.  The camera will not activate a simple (cheap) hot-shoe-connected external strobe.  I can trip the flash by shorting the center pin so it would appear to be a fault with my camera.  It may be the camera is expecting a more sophisticated strobe although it clearly recognizes that something is connected.4.  As with other such cameras, I wish the body was available in silver because black just absorbs too much heat in the sun (I had a silver FZ18 but have been unable to find succeeding models in that color)I was a bit concerned about spending over $100 more than for my last top-of-the-line Lumix bridge camera but it is defintely worth it and I am very pleased indeed.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for birding", "Author": "A.

You gain 2 stops with this lens over most other similar cameras at 600mm equivalent.Do experiment with sharpness and noise reduction settings if you shoot jpegs only. I generally prefer setting both to -2. I avoid any izoom, ires, i anything. I do use the EZ zoom feature. For added reach and to reduce cropping, I use a good quality 1.7X teleconverter with the LA7 adaptor. Gets me 1020mm equivalent. Yes, Canon SX50 is 1200, but the lens is slow, camera is slow.UPDATE JUNE 2013:Well, now I am using iZoom with the camera set to use jpeg and raw. The advantages are that: (1) you get the extra zoom view of the bird for better seeing, exposure, focus, (2) you get a raw file, (3) No wasted time switching in and out of EZ zoom settings (which is jpeg only). Sometimes the iZoom jpeg files look darn good but mostly use the raw files to avoid artifacts and get more detail, recoverability of blown highlights, etc. The only disadvantage I've encountered is when trying to review right after shooting in burst mode due to using raw. The buffer is still clearing and you are stuck not being able to take a pic for many seconds. So I try not to review while there is an ongoing opportunity.For processing raws: I import everything into LR4, delete, pick, rate, etc. Then open up Silkypix 5 Pro and import a raw file. I find SP5 is quicker and better in initial raw processing than LR4. Then a Tiff is brought into LR4 for final touches and export. Silkypix 5 Pro is currently on sale for Panasonic cameras.

I am totally amazed and satisfied with the images I have taken so far.This camera replaces my FZ30.  Surprisingly, the FZ200 is a little smaller, and lighter than the FZ30.  While the FZ30 was good for it's day, it didn't do nearly as well in low light, and it's 35mm minimum focal length was a poor excuse for a wide angle.  The FZ200 has eliminated both of those shortcomings, but not only that, the \"Intelligent Auto\" on the FZ200 is a quantum leap ahead of the \"Auto\" on the FZ30.While the FZ200 does have a learning curve, it is only an issue for the dozens of advanced features. The good news is that those advanced features can be learned when I am ready; they are not required to get good quality images right from day one. That was not the case with the FZ30.Unfortunately, the FZ200 only comes with a basic 40 page manual. The full 220 page manual that explains all of the features is not printed out, but comes on a CD instead.  My local office supply store wanted $25 to print it, so I printed it out myself for much less.The only other camera I even considered purchasing was the Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 50x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom, but the fact that the Panasonic lense can handle f2.8 all the way to 600mm cinched the deal for me, although, I'm sure the Canon is a great camera, as well.UPDATE: I've had over a year now, and my enthusiasm for this camera has not changed at all; in fact, it has increased over what it was initially, as I gradually learn how to use many of the additional features.  To name a few, I really like the \"hand held night shots,\" and the simplified \"panorama\" feature--much improved over the method used in the FZ30. The only thing I miss about the FZ30 was the manual focus ring.  That was much superior to the manual focus of this camera, but it is a small price to pay for all of the other advancements this camera offers.I also appreciate all of the fine videos on the FZ200 that Graham Houghton, of the UK, has provided on You-Tube.

Its only use is to transfer photos to your computer, not to charge on the go.  So one would need to carry the external AC charging adapter with them on vacation.Original Review:First, get over the sticker shock.  This camera is probably the most expensive Bridge/super-zoom camera you can buy.  But by many accounts it's the best you can get (depending on what you consider 'best' and how well its capabilities fit your requirements).I was looking to purchase a super-zoom/bridge camera for an upcoming Africa safari, and my trusty Canon G11 5x optical zoom just won't cut it for my desire to get close-ups of wildlife I won't be able to get close to.So I researched my purchase to death before pulling the trigger and ordering this camera from Amazon.I actually first went to buy locally, but the local camera specialty shop that says they price match said they couldn't match Amazon's price or they'd lose money.  Whether this is true or not, I can't say, but I walked away and quickly ordered from Amazon.  It arrived quickly (as usual, thanks Prime!).Reasons why I ordered this camera and not any of its other competitors:1.  Incredible battery life (as reported in multiple online review sites)2.  Swivel/tilt articulating rear display screen (important to me for the many self-portraits I always take on vacation)3.  Long zoom lens.  Not the longest on the market, surely, but long enough for what I need.4.  Constant f2.8 at all zoom levels.  I'm not a pro photographer but I understand the value of a wide aperature for faster shutter and less blur/lower ISO esp at long zooms.5.  Quality optics6.  Electronic view finder (EVF) is very high quality.  Would be more important to me if it had poor battery life to not use LCD and use EVF in a pinch, but since battery life is so stellar maybe I'll never even use the EVF.  I will have to see how well the rear LCD display does in bright sunlight.Reasons why I was not 100% enthused about ordering this camera:1.  Reviews reported that JPG impage capture was 'noisy' even at lower ISO -- lots of compression artifacts.  I don't shoot in RAW (I'm just a consumer).2.  Some other cameras offer greater zoom (50X on Canon).  Would I be missing out?3.  Other cameras have higher resolution rear LCD screen.4.  Would have been nice for EVF to have sensor to disable rear LCD when using EVF.  But convenient button can be used for this so it's not a deal breaker.5.  Sensor size is 1/2.3\".  Other cameras like the Fuji HX50 have slightly larger sensor at 1/2\".  But would it really make that much of a difference?6.  Price.  Obviously.  But I'm not adverse to paying for quality.  This Africa trip is a once-in-a-lifetime trip and the opportunity to capture great photos is paramount.I did not care at all about GPS, WiFi, or touch-screen LCD.  Features I would not really use so that a camera lacked them, IMHO, was not a negative.  Image quality is more of a concern.So I decided the pro's outweighed the cons's.The minute I unboxed it, I screwed on the UV filter I ordered with it.  I won't go a minute without the lens being protected.  Charged up the battery to full capacity before even turning on the camera.  Things I love about it now that I've used it a bit:1.  Auto-focus is quick, even at close in zooms.  Very quick wide angle, quick zoomed in.2.  Image quality is quite good.  Tweaked some scene settings based on stuff I found on YouTube (search FZ200 for great tutorials there)3.  Solid build quality.  This camera doesn't feel cheap and plastic-y.4.  Lots of great menu options.  It will take me some tmie to get to learn them all, but I've got about 2 months before the big Africa safari trip to do this.5.  Came with a lens hood for shooting in sunny conditions to avoid lens flare.  Unexpected bonus, didn't realize this was bundled.6.  Auto mode produces great shots, with manual mode and use of some advanced settings even better results can be achieved.7.  You can recharge the battery in-camera with the supplied USB lead from a computer or an AC adapter, good for travel.  Don't know how long that takes but I ordered extra batteries and external AC charger to use if needed.8.  That whole 'fixed f2.8' thing really is nice -- lets in a lot of light even at extreme zooms.  While the camera may not have the largest image sensor, getting in more light will help get you better pictures.Things I have seen:1.  If you are a pixel-peeper and zoom all the way in to a digital photo you've taken, yes, you will see JPG artifacts.  But unless I'm blowing it up to make a 20x30 shot, I don't suspect this will be a problem for me.2.  Battery life does seem to be stellar so far.3.  My cat makes a great subject for my experiments with settings.  I suspect dogs will work well too.Other cameras I considered:1. Sony's DSC-HX200V latest super-zoom looked good and had good features but I haven't found Sony products to last.2. Canon HS50 looked good and was fun to use but FZ200 was rated higher.  Had the extreme zoom that in the end I felt was overkill.3. Fuji HX50 EXR looks really nice and on paper has about every feature of the FZ200.  I see this as the closest competitor.  Didn't really research this model much before purchasing the FZ200 but ultimately I'm not sure it would have made a difference, I love the FZ200.  I would probably love the HX50 just as much (though it's heavier but has a longer zoom, is that a good thing?)4. Nikon P520 -- initially one of my very favorites when I first started looking, because it was light and fun (and cheaper!) but it lacked some key features I wanted.

I am a part time working pro that was looking for something point and shooty to take on travel rather than lug around pounds of mag alloy and heavy weathersealed lenses.  Please dont buy this camera and expect the same IQ would get for any larger sensored camera, because you won't get it.  However, I fully expected this and understood the limitations.  First the good:The F2.8 constant aperture zoom to 600 is quite good, as a matter of fact it was one of the main selling points.  If I want this kind of reach with my pro equipment, a 600mm equiv F2.8 lens it would set me back almost $8,000.  Detail and resolution seem very good, with the best results around 100-300mm.  Soft at 600mm but then I had no tripod and part of it could be me.Easy menu structure but then I have a LX5 TS3 and GX1 so I am used to Panny menus.Good jpgs, not great, but good.  Nice colors and detail in RAW shots.Quiet fast very responsive no shutter lag, full-rez burst mode is fantastic.Focus lock is very fast except at full reach, where it can take a bit.Video, what little I shot, was VERY nice.Long battery life!!!Fully compatible with Panny and Olympus flashes (they are the same all made by Panny just branded differently)Takes 52mm filtersAnd now the dodgy:Yes it is noisy, even at ISO100, albeit minimally.  Hopefully a firmware update will correct some of the low ISO jpg noise.  Shoot RAW is my recommendation.Build kinda plasticky and cheap, but then Im used to heavy duty pro gearNeeds auto eye detector from viewfinder to LCD screen.Wish it had a manual zoom mechanism but I can live with the servo.I think I got an open-box from Amazon, but all was OK.  Check your package carefully for obvious human contact.All in all my complaints are pretty minimal and have mostly to do with ergonomics.  I can live with the noise as it is mostly the issue in jpgs and I shoot RAW mostly.  This is one fine camera if you understand its limitations, and a viable option for pros like me to take on vacations and trips where critical need is not an issue.  The Leica-branded 25-600 F2.8, however, is a game-changer, and makes this cam rise above the rest in its class.  Nice to see a manufacturer return to its roots.  All it needs now is its first firmware update to smooth out the rough spots.  4.5 stars.PS if you have a Mac you HAVE to have Mountain Lion OS to view the RAW files in Finder, and if you use Aperture you need 3.4 or later to process the RAWs.

Allen", "ReviewID": "R1MOZX49KW4HD7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I certainly admit that in an ideal world, a skilled photographer could probably take higher quality photos with a DSLR. But it's not an ideal world. (And just maybe I'm not a skilled photographer.)Four years ago, I bought two camera setups: a $300 Canon superzoom SX10, and a $3500+ Canon XSi DSLR setup, with 50mm f1.4, 17-55mm f2.8, and 70-200mm f2.8 lenses, 580 flash, and even an official Canon backpack to lug it all around.As you might expect, the DSLR got used very little. Just too much stuff, too big, too bulky, etc. At my daughter's recent college graduation everyone looked at me like I was insane for carrying the camera with big white lens into the arena.And they were right. That giant $1600 lens only goes to 200mm. A superzoom goes in much closer.Then I looked back over the years, and realized that almost all of the great photos I took were with the Canon superzoom. Really the only thing I didn't love was that it didn't have a large aperture when zoomed, so you couldn't narrow the depth of field and focus on your subject while leaving the background out of focus. The video in that camera was also from the pre-HD days- pretty bad.So I sold all the DSLR stuff on ebay (lenses really held their value, thank goodness!) and looked to replace the SX10 with today's best superzoom. The FZ200's fixed f2.8 lens makes the choice an easy one.I chose the FZ200 and love everything about it. I bought a few filters to play with (Panasonic ND filter and rotating polarized filter) and a cheapo $12 wide angle lense from Neewer that I'm sure isn't great (UPDATE: That wide angle lens is terrible, forget that one!). It all just barely fits in the Case Logic 304 carrying case. (All these addons are available from Amazon.)This is a great camera.", "Date": "February 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of the best \"point and shoot\" cameras.", "Author": "Leepnow", "ReviewID": "RIYVYV9YLZLHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are so many great features on this camera, comparable to the DSLR I had to sell and even some additional ones such as panorama. The grip is comfortable and solid in your hand which is important since this is a light camera, an advantage to me as it makes it easy to carry around on an all day event, meaning it gets used more.The 2.8 Leica lens is the big attraction here as is the zoom, even if the far end gets a bit too soft, one of the disadvantages here, although I haven't found any vignetting. With the right post processing software it usually can be corrected a little.  However, being used to a 300mm zoom, if I don't push it all the way out I get good shots.  This might be difficult for beginners who want to really \"get out there\" but truly, pulling back a little still gives great telephoto shots. Having the additional telephoto/ wide angle lever on the left side is a big help as makes it easier to select them.I was pleasantly surprised by the \"burst\" function and the options offered.  Being a \"street\" photographer and doing some dog and horse shows, it enables me to realize some good shots from all the action, helped a great deal by the anti shake which could be stronger offering more stop difference but for a camera of this size and type it works well.  While I've only had the camera for about six weeks, I haven't noticed any lens creep which is important so the camera holds the telephoto distance even when on but not in use.One of the big drawbacks is in the viewfinder system.  Because I am \"old school\" and a longtime DSLR user, I prefer to use the viewfinder, although the articulated screen is a big help for high and low shots.  The view finder has a strong rainbow effect as others have complained about.  I'm really surprised here because given the Leica lens and greater cost of this camera, I expected better.  It means you can't really judge the tonal quality of the shot without then having to open the screen.  Because of this, it would have been better for the user if the change between the two was automatic instead of having to push the button to switch.  I do like, however, all the info available through the viewfinder including battery level and the red and green indicator lights as they save time.  The diopter adjustment for the viewfinder is a pleasant addition since most PS cameras don't have it.I haven't yet tried the video but made sure I had CLASS 10 cards, and paid the little more to get a high speed card as it greatly reduces the \"read time\" between still shots--which is better than expected given the type of camera this is.  Another nice surprise for a camera of this type is the ability to had greater wide angle and telephoto capability, with the attachments being a bit high but not outrageous.  I purchased this camera so I could travel light and not mess with lens changes, etc, but it's nice to know they are available should I need them in the future.IN SUMMARY: I looked and compared for quite a bit before selecting the Lumiz FZ200 (which is really a noticeable advance over the FZ150) and being a Canon user for a lot of years, it was a tough decision between the Canon G16 and this in the price range I wanted to spend.  For my purposes though, this offered more for my type of usage.  I feel this is an advanced point and shoot which places it one step below the DSLR and should be a big consideration for those wanting to travel light and not be bothered by all the lens changes and for those who are in the early stages of learning photography because it will not only help them learn about aperture, speed, and iso (and give them control over them) but will still let them put it on auto and grab shots of the kids playing.

I have tested it at various zooms and full wide, 100% crops look fairly bad. Checking to see if it is \"operator error\" or just the way it is.  It is a little unfair as I am comparing it to my Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G3 16 MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD (Body Only) at the same focal length.  The G3 looks good at 100% crop where the FZ200 is fuzzed away.  I am going to do some more comparisons forcing the same f-stop and ISO.  Note that I am comparing both JPEG and RAW.  I have a variety of lenses for the G3 including the 14-45, 45-200, f2.8 19mm, and a wide range of legacy lenses so I can match the reach of the FZ200 for testing.  Of course, none of the zooms is f2.8 through it's entire range like the lens on the FZ200.11/19/12 UPDATE: After months of using this as my second camera and for sports photos (read below), I have found that certain settings improve the IQ.  For some reason \"Happy\" instead of standard seems to really crank up the apparent resolution. The HDR option provides wonderful pictures, and the automatic panorama is better than I have seen on any other camera.  After learning my way around the camera, I would change my rating to 4.5!  You really need to learn how to use this camera to get the best results, it is way beyond a \"point and shoot\".It does provide unlimited video recording using AVCHD Progressive.  Only limit is your card size, no 29 minute cutoff.  The MPEG-4 does have the cutoff, but that is mandated by the type of file created.  MPEG-4 creates one file and therefore is limited by FAT32.  AVCHD creates multiple linked files so doesn't run up again the file limitations of the cards.  The mis-informed individual should take down his 2 star review.  Videos are excellent.  The slo-motion video capability is way beyond what I have seen on the competitors.  For sports coaching, this would be an excellent choice.Compared to the G3, build feels a little cheap.  Compared to most of the super-zooms I have had, build quality is about the same.  The balance of the camera is excellent and the hand-grip is just the right size.  Nothing feels out of place.The EVF has a smaller opening than on the G3 and is hard to see wearing glasses (which I do).  Disappointed in this as I use the EVF for 95% of all pictures I take.  The diaopter adjustment is excellent, with good range.I do like the zoom on the left side of the lens.  Really in the right place and very useful.  It is very useful when doing video as it helps to keep the camera steady as you zoom.  Combined with the stabilization in the camera, it makes your videos look almost pro.Night Shots: Used the night shot feature which I miss in my G3.  The camera takes multiple exposures and assembles together to provide good pictures in low light.  Works well, you have to be really steady but it seems to account for the minor human shakes well.  Understand the G5 has this feature, trying to find a manual online to confirm.Update, 11/19/12, SPORTS COACHING with high speed video:The 120 fps and 240 fps videos work GREAT!  Used them for my high school teams and in my daily teaching.  I bought a wireless remote control RainbowImaging 100 Meter 2.4GHz Wireless Remote Shutter Release for Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ20, FZ20K, FZ25, FZ30, FZ50, LC1, L10, L1, G1, GH1, GF1, GH2, G2 & Leica Digilux 1, DIGILUX 2, DIGILUX 3, Replaces panasonic DMW-RS1, put the camera on a tripod and have people hitting balls as I feed or serving.  Then immediately can have them review and see what they need to correct.  Going to get a Transcend Information 16 GB Wi-Fi SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (TS16GWSDHC10) when they come out so I can have a laptop by the court to show the videos right after taking them -- waiting for this because I want the class 10 throughput.  Still working out the best settings, but so far everyone has been floored by the IQ on these slo-mo videos.Recommended bag for this camera: Case Logic SLRC-200 SLR Camera Holster (Black)Note that I sold my DMC-G3 and bought an Olympus OM-D E-M5 16MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3.0-Inch Tilting OLED Touchscreen and 12-50mm Lens (Black).

Now I'm not a pro by any means but I do like taking quick pictures.  When the moment is there, I like to snap away.  I'm not one for setting things up and taking time to take a shot.  I like to just snap away.The camera is larger than my prevous FZ-18 but not so big that it's cumbersome or bulky.  Anyone who's had a Lumix model will find the layout relatively similar.I use a 52mm Agfa filter (see my other review) on the lens which just screws straight into the lens - and you can still use the regular lens cap on top!  The battery compartment is at the bottom; this is also where the SD card goes.  On the right is the micro USB out port and the mini HDMI out port.  The panel is a flexible type panel which is a little concerning in terms of longevity.  I like the new on/off switch which is to the side of the main dial as oppsoed to a separate slider switch on the FZ-18.  The Main dial itself has the usual iA (plus iA Plus), shutter priority, aperture priority, program mode, video mode, two custom modes, and the scene mode.There is a burst mode button to the right of the main dial which I haven't yet used.  The wide/tele zoom is the usual (at least for panasonic) lever around the shutter button which I find counter-intuitive - i'm glad they put another zoom lever on the left side of the barrel which I find myself using more than the zoom ring on top.  There's also a separate mic input for an external mic and a hot shoe for a dedicated flash.  OIS works great even at the longer zoom range but of course this depends on your settings.  However, if shooting at a relatively slow shutter speed or full zoom, you may still want to use a tripod.I really like the swivel screen (although it could be easier to open - I have to use my fingernails to do so) - it's size is good and it is very clear - it wasn't washing out in sunlight.  it's not a touch screen but that's just fine by me as the 4 way dial to the right is very easy to use.  Although the viewfinder has a diopter adjustment dial, for me the viewfinder is so small that trying to frame any picture is harder and I just use the LCD screen. YMMV.There are two function buttons that can be assigned with custom settings.  There is also a quick menu button at the bottom on the rear which can be used to make quick adjustments whilst shooting.  This is useful for changing things such as metering mode, flash, exposure, image size etc on the fly in any mode.In fact, there are SO MANY settings that the best way to discover what it can do is to play around with it.  For example, the iA setting has only a couple of things that can be changed (such as picture size and color mode) but on the iAplus setting, you can change brightness, color, and depth of field using the rear upper dial.I usually take pictures in JPEG but the FZ200 can also shoot in RAW for those who want to.  Honestly to date the quality of the pictures I've taken doesn't warrant me shooting in RAW.  But then I only either view my pictures on my screen, email them, or print them at small sizes (eg 6 x 4).  If you need to print at larger sizes, you may want to shoot in RAW - that's also if you carry out editing afterwards - which I don't as I simply don't have the time.Video (Full HD in MP4 format) is excellent and reinforces my decision not to get a separate camcorder.  One cool (but gimicky) feature is the ability to take a snapshot picture when taking video.  Simply press the shutter button when recording and the camera takes a picture.  I haven't yet mastered all the controls so I could be doing something wrong but the quality of these pictures is very poor.  There just so much noise (imagine a picture shot at, say, iso 12000 or so) that these pictures are really only useful for a critical moment.  The video itself is great and there are no issues there.  I like that I can shoot in MPEG instead of AVCHD.  You can zoom whilst recording and the camera auto-focuses whilst doing so.  There ia a quick record button on top so that even if you're in photo mode, you can still press the button to start recording instantly.  Great feature.  Of course you can still choose dedicated recording from the top dial which gives you more setting options.The only thing I wished that Panasonic had added was a zoom gauge on the top of the lend barrel so that I could tell what (35mm equivalent) focal length I'm at.To me, this camera seems as fully featured as a DSLR and I'm sure i'll have fun discovering its capabilites.  Although I've only used it a few times so far both inside and out, I haven't noticed any blurring, fringing, or noise (at least at iso 200 - and other than in the record mode as I mentioned above)), or any other things that some may be complaining about.The colors are full and rich, noise (at least at iso 200 to 400) is non-existent, and playing with depth of field can be great (given the f2.8 aperture capabilites of the lens throughout the focal range).  For an amateur like me, I can't see myself ever getting (or needing) a DSLR.Having had a little time with this camera, I can say that this is definitely a keeper!***UPDATE*** Oct 7th 2013This has been a great camers over the summer.  I've really appreciated its portability especially whilst on vacation.  Friends were amazed at just how good most of my pcitures wcame out.  And these are friends with $2500 DSLRs !!!The reason? - Like every new technology, there is a learning curve.  I'm definitely not even an amateur photographer - I'm just an average Joe who likes to take good pictures (rather than crappy cellphone ones!) and keep them for posterity.I've not really found that i've needed a manual since I just like to experiment and I find that's the best way to get to know something.  For example, I'll take 10 pictures of something using different settings and see what look good.  What my friends don't see are that for ever 1 picture they see, there may have been numerous others that didn't look good.  But that's MY fault - not the camera's.Once I find a setting I like, I then use that for all my similar shots.  I do make full use of the definable function buttons for such things as flash exposure and bracketing.Video has been a treat and I don't miss not having a camcorder.

Where this camera seems to shine over the 150 are in the custom settings.  Finally, as someone pointed out, the lens hood takes some getting used to.  Once you force it on and off a few times it starts to get easier.  It does click into place firmly with some effort.  I'm still irritated by the lens hood closing on my fingers, but the reality is that the lens hood isn't something I really use frequently.  I've seen some absolutely amazing shots taken with the FZ-200 by those that know what they're doing.  Thus, this camera may be better suited for more advanced users or those looking to take their photographic knowledge up a notch from the 150.  See some of these shots, and you may just click the 'buy' button.  [...]I've updated my rating to 4 stars.--------First of all, this is an evolution from the prior model.  I've been using the FZ-150 since December of last year, and was excited to hear about the full range F2.8 of the new FZ-200.  The FZ-150 is a fantastic camera, and I've been incredibly impressed by the photos I've captured.  I'm not here to discuss megazooms vs. SLRs, but I can tell you that having this much range in such a small package makes it worth the trade off in my opinion.I received the FZ-200 on Saturday, and took it to Mt. Jefferson in Oregon to catch some scenic shots.  Some early observations:Low light performance seems better, but the program menus are completely different.  I was unable to test long exposures, despite trying to find the feature for 10 minutes straight.The new viewfinder is AMAZING.  That being said, it's still a digital viewfinder.  As such, performance in dark conditions is non-existent.  You'll be guessing at where you're aiming your shot.  In good lighting, it's crystal clear.  A massive improvement over the 150.Fit and finish seems on par, but the glare shield seems loose compared to the FZ-150.  In fact, it barely stays on.Which brings me to a major issue.  Because the barrel is considerably larger than the 150, get ready to feel like you're going to get your fingers amputated.  If the glare shield is stored on the camera (which is normal), the barrel will try to retract when the camera goes to sleep.  Because the gap between the grip and the barrel has been dramatically reduced, when the lens retracts the glare cover tries to close around your fingers.  Holy **** it can hurt.  I also suspect it's terrible for the motor.  Leave it off, and the problem is solved.  Still, what were they thinking?Panorama Mode:  Useless.  Use Photoshop or anything else.  Images were incredibly pixelated for some reason, especially in bright light.  It also takes the image from an incredibly narrow field of view.Video:  Same as the 150.  I've not really seen a huge difference, although the slow motion functions are nice.Is it worth upgrading?  Probably.

I always \"abandoned\" them and went back to my DSLR because of one reason, at the longer end of the zoom, the aperture would end up being too slow in all but really bright mid day light.  I would have to bump up the ISO too much and the shots lost their detail due to the small sensor.  THIS camera, shockingly, keeps the aperture at a fast 2.8 throughout the whole 25-600mm range.  Shots in overcast skies can now be at ISO 100-200, and usually not more than ISO 400, thus keeping the shutter speed fast enough to stop any action and the lower ISO keeps more of the much needed detail.This camera has ALL the bells and whistles including HDR, Fast burst rates, Raw capture, Multiple Scene modes and many more.

Now, I usually download the pictures and adjust the exposure on the pics from my Panasonics.  No big deal.  But last week I took 268 pictures with the Olympus at a horse show .  Downloaded into my computer, and , well, I have never worked so long in my life adjusting color, exposure, tint, warmth, hours and hours-after using the automatic.  I have to say the Olympus 4/3 system took amazingly clear awesome pictures.  Almost too crisp!  But the hours I spent adjusting each picture made me decide to go get the FZ200.I am a happy clam.  I've just been sitting on the couch playing around photographing stuff around my house, and I am very impressed with the sharp pictures at the zoom all the way out, (use a tripod), with a lamp lit and dark outside.

With auto-intelligence, you rely on the camera to make the decisions , and I am not liking other brand's \"brains\", they just don't \"think\" like I do.  Panasonic cameras do.

I finally ordered another FZ200, hoping I got a bad one the first time.  I got it yesterday and have been running tests on it, and it is much better than the first FZ200 I got.  There is still some noise if you use I-Zoom, but it is not overwhelming like it was with the first camera I got in August 2012.  I am happy with this new one and am doing some comparing to the Canon SX50 HS later in the comments.I was the top reviewer of the FZ100 and FZ150 and have been directly responsible for selling many of those cameras.  I know my way around these Panasonic cameras and am not a beginner at all.  My review for the FZ150 has over 3000 commments and is still going strong.The FZ200 camera I got in August of 2012 was just full of noise.  No matter what I did, the noise was excessive, even at ISO 100.  Forget about using any kind of extended zoom like I-Zoom because the compression noise was terrible.  The photos looked good at a 20% view, but at 100% they were horrible.  The noise looked like little worms all over the place.  Some said that I should not be looking at 100%, but I always looked at my FZ150 photos at 100% and they look fine.  I sent the camera back after messing with it for two weeks, trying everything I could think of.  Nothing worked.  I did not order another camera because quite a few others were complaining of the noise as well and I had it with the FZ200 camera.  I am a die hard Panasonic fan and it really hurt me to give up on the camera.Update - 2/8/2013.  I bought the FZ200 camera again and went right out and took some shots.  I took some of the same shots I had taken with the first FZ200 camera and it was good this time.  The worms and compression trash was gone.  It is not to say that there was no noise.  There is noise in the pictures, but it is about the same as the noise I see with the FZ150.  I am satisfied with the noise I see now, at 100% viewing!I love all the features the FZ200 has and the terrific f/2.8 through the entire zoom. I am going to expand much on this review, but it will take me a day or two to do this. I took pictures with the FZ150 and the FZ200 camera side by side at 24X with the I-Zoom turned off, and in my opinion the FZ200 gets the edge on picture quality over the FZ150.  The pictures look a little more detailed at f/5, and even better yet at f/2.8.  It is known that the sweet spot for the FZ200 is f/4.5, but I think my camera looks best at f/2.8 so far.  I will be using f/4.5 for most of my outside shots.  I didn't like the quality at f/8.  The pictures were far more detailed at the lower f stops. The FZ150 will only go to 32X in I-Zoom On, and the FZ200 goes to 48X with I-Zoom On.  I tried taking some shots at 32X with the I-Zoom On in both cameras, and the results are both about the same.  The testing I did is on page 8 of the comments.  You can compare for yourself.I highly recommend you watch the Youtube videos from Graham Houghton on the FZ200 camera.  They are very informative and excellent.

This is a very nice superzoom camera but like all of them, the critical element, the sensor, determines just how good the images will be. This camera uses a smallish sensor which has a good bit of noise even at base ISO 100. The autofocus is another surprising irritation in that the more you zoom, the farther away you must get. Trying to zoom all the way in, for example, on fish in an aquarium, can't be done. You'll have to back up to use the full 600mm reach, or zoom out. The autofocus is very hard to work with at 600mm if there are intervening objects, like tree branches. They may look tiny but they will block the autofocus. Fortunately there is a manual override for focusing. Exposure sometimes misses too, especially in backlit situations. The major annoyance there is that everything looks nice and bright on the LCD but when you examine the image on a computer you have a lot of work to do.The camera really shines in it's design and flexibility. The swivel LCD screen is a joy to use and makes tough shots a whole lot easier. The EVF is responsive and performs well. The camera seems to weigh next to nothing and lets you carry it all day without breaking your neck. Video mode is outstanding, nice and sharp, very pleasing color, and good sound too. The lens is simply excellent too. Oh! And NICE job, Panasonic, on the flash sync. You can use a non-dedicated flash at any shutter speed. Any. This is something I thought was only possible with dedicated units.All in all, I like the camera and expected many of its limits; this is the 4th or fifth superzoom I have owned. You can take very good to excellent shots with this camera and as long as you can live with the noise, you'll be very happy. If you are an old foggie like me you probably have a slightly blurry or grainy picture of your mom or dad or first horse or dog and you treasure that picture because of who it is.

If I were asked about it by a friend or family member I would definitely recommend it extremely highly.Why did I only give it four stars then?  Because it lacks a feature that exists on my earlier versions of this (the FZ8 and FZ35) and even my husband's pocketable ZS3.  Both of us do a lot of macro photography which includes trying to focus on subjects that are often so small they may be nearly invisible to the naked eye.  Maybe 1/16th of an inch in diameter.  Because of that, we both have all the cameras set on spot focus (which works very well).For some unfathomable reason, Panasonic has made it impossible to KEEP the camera on spot focus.  Yes you can get there -- a couple of different ways and it only takes a couple of seconds to do it, but when you turn the camera off, it reverts back to the larger 'single area' focusing square.  That means that every time I turn the camera on again, I have to reset it to spot focus.  It's a serious step backward for Panasonic that they no longer permit their customers to be able to know, select and retain their preferred focusing mode.Oddly, you can set just about anything else to \"resume\" things how you left them.  Examples:  zoom resume, menu resume, etc.  Just no focusing resume and that's probably the most important thing other than the lens itself.It is incomprehensible to me why they would omit this very useful feature that already existed in this line of cameras.  I'm sure I can and will learn to work around it, but its extremely frustrating and annoying and I believe a serious engineering design fault.In some ways feel that I should have given the camera five stars because I may very well be the only person in the world who uses spot focusing as my preferred default focusing method, but since I'm the one who has the camera and I'm the one affected by this omission I really can't give it five stars because I'm not completely happy with it.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Camera's Versatility But It Is Menu Driven", "Author": "Cliifford J.

The Leica name tells why.When I asked at two camera shops about competing brands of cameras, they extolled various features but none impressed me sufficiently to dissuade from looking again at Lumix. My single hesitation was lack of a hands on inspection at a shop, and I had to ask online to get one uncertainty about video zoom answered. If Panasonic did not have satisfied customers able to answer questions, it would not be selling as many as it does.Once that single doubt was removed, I ordered the FZ200 and it was delivered one day earlier than predicted.

I also own the older, although still venerable FZ50, so I have some basis to compare these Panasonic Lumix cameras. I believe the FZ200 is finally the upgrade to my FZ50 I've been waiting for. The FZ200 is significantly lighter and smaller than the FZ50.I used to carry around a separate video camera, and a separate stills camera. While that may have been acceptable in the past, carrying around two large heavy cameras gets..old. I needed a single camera that did both. That leaves you to decide which of the two mediums you value most- do you want great video and so-so stills? Get a video camera. Do you want great stills, and so-so video? Get a stills camera. However- that has changed now that I have the FZ200.I bought the FZ200 due to its ability to shoot great video and also take great still photos. No longer do I need to carry two cameras- the FZ200 does it all. The video from this camera is great, 1080P, you can choose to use AVCHD, or MPEG. You can zoom in or out while shooting video, it has optical stabilization, and there are also many different modes to shoot video in- all this means it does a great job on video. Pop a 32G card in the camera and you have lots of room to shoot video and take pictures. This camera is an excellent choice for family outings where you want to do both video and stills, and do not want to carry around a large camera bag full of cameras, lenses, and gear. One camera and you're done.My experience shooting video has been great. The camera takes excellent 1080P avchd video. I originally used a standard Transcend 32gb class 10 card, pictures were fine, but video failed to record reliably. I swapped in a Sandisk Ultra, and no problems. So my recommendation is- buy a fast SD card. Shooting 1080p video transfers a ton of information to the card and you need to have a really fast card. The optical stabilization is really good, and makes for steady video.Picture performance is great with an excellent f2.8 zoom lens that gives bright, clear, sharp pictures- even at the far end of the zoom range. Comparing the pictures from my FZ50 to this camera shows a big difference. The FZ200 takes much clearer, sharper pictures. The extra zoom range compared to the FZ50 really makes a difference. There are a ton of picture modes, and controls for the camera (although perhaps too many buttons on the thing). Take the time to read the manual and you will be amazed. The FZ200 really takes some great pictures.One more pro: really long battery life. The spec calls for something like 540 pictures per charge, and my experience backs that up. Battery life is exceptional.There are a few cons I have discovered, and they are relatively minor, but if I designed the camera I would change these for the next revision:The lens cap is a little small, could use bigger tabs to make it easier to use. Really minor though. Could always buy a 52mm from another brand to fix this.The camera manual comes on a CD. There is no camera manual packed in. There is a tiny quick start guide, but that's it for manuals. That is a shame considering the multitude and depth of the functions of the camera. What happens if you're in the field and you have a question about functions? You're out of luck. Not including a decent manual in the box may save Panasonic a buck each camera, but it cheapens the value of the brand, especially considering the price you pay. This is not an impulse buy, and is an expensive camera. A physical manual needs to be included so you can carry it around.Lack of a true manual focus. My other Lumix, the FZ50 has a true manual zoom ring, and that would be nice on this camera also. You will notice this problem when you try to focus on, say, animals at the zoo behind a fence. The camera will focus on the fence, not the animal. Attempting to use the manual focus button on the side is cumbersome, and in my experience, too difficult to use.Those cons aside, it's a great camera!", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent and Fun", "Author": "titaniumrx \"titaniumrx\"", "ReviewID": "R4E3XCQTNNIWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing the FZ200 comparing it with the Canon and the Nikon which of course have longer lenses.

I find that the quality of the photos is very good although I have to admit that I haven't printed any (printing is a rarity for me), mostly viewing on a 1080p 42\" TV and a 1680x1050 monitor.I have had some fun experimenting with sunrise and moon shots.  The sunrise shots are quite amazing using the scene setting for sunset and shooting in burst mode.  Without realizing it, I shot almost 400 frames of the sunrise so I made it into a nice time lapse video.  The lens did have a little flare due to the angle that I was shooting at and probably could have been cut paying better attention to framing.  Haven't played with the included software yet since I had older software that I am already familiar with but I will give raw files and SilkyPix a try.For everyone who has downgraded this camera because of its high comparative cost, there is hope.  The company that I work for is a business partner of Panasonic and just before Christmas they ran a deal for us and I paid substantially less than the lowest price anyone has ever seen for this camera.  It is new, not a refurb and it was shipped straight from Panasonic.  I mention this for those of you who have patience - if you are willing to wait a bit, you might save quite a bit.For me, the combination of the excellent camera and the great value made it an easy choice compared to the Canon or the Nikon.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best so far", "Author": "Donald Mudd", "ReviewID": "R2AII73GU4ENWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sharpness of focus all through the full range of zoom...and the ability to stop the water drops left by the duck'stake-off.

I first owned the original 6 mp Canon digital rebel with the kit lens and soon purchased the 75-300 mm canon zoom with image stabilization.  After getting tired of lugging around a backpack i sold it and went with a superzoom.  When tamron came out with their 18-270 mm zoom that was my ticket to get back into the dslr market and purchased a canon t2i and finally upgraded to the t3i with the pzd tamron 18-270. ALthough better than before I got tired of lugging this for travel and looked again to the superzoom market.Upon getting the fz200 a friend of mine came over to compare shots taken with my fz 200, canon t3i/ tamron 18-270, and his canon sx50 (50x zoom) and nikon 510 (42x zoom).  Shots were taken on automatic indoors of the same objects from the approximate same distances.  Our conclusion was if there was a difference in image quality between the canon dslr t3i and the super zooms it was negligile at best.  In addition when I showed family members shots of the same object with the panasonic and canon dlsr they could not pick the dslr shots as sometimes they were actually taken with the superzoom!I will never go back to a dslr and am selling mine.  Just got back from a cruise and pics were great.  Its sad to see so many people buying great dslr cameras with a $ 100 kit lens that has only a 3x optical zoom.  They would be far better off saving the $100 on the kit lens and buying an all in one 18-250 or 18-270 zoom lens. However, they would be spending upwards of $1300-$1400 for a camera and lens that still falls short of the zoom reach of this panasonic at f 2.8!  They could save $800-$900 with a great super zoom and be just as happy with the image quality.

Child", "ReviewID": "R17DUCNW4X1LFJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded from an FZ20 to this FZ200 and am very glad I did so. The picture and video quality is quite good -- even under adverse conditions. I use the camera almost every day and carry it on cruises and tours all over the place -- taking one to two hundred images every day when on a trip. It functions well and has a lot of nice features... but more than I will ever need or learn to use. I would not purchase a camera with this wide array of features except that I did want a few of the new and improved features and especially to have the great Leica lens... but with the lens comes all the rest. [There seems to be a contest on the part of manufacturers these days to see who can cram the most bells and whistles into modern electronic/digital devices.]My main complaint when the camera was new to me, was the location of some of the function buttons. The camera is not too heavy and fits my hand very well so I tend to carry it in my right hand a lot while actively taking pictures. Even after ten months of use, I occasionally discover that I have accidentally depressed a button somewhere and changed some kind of setting and I can't always quickly figure out what has changed nor how to \"fix\" it.The only BIG problem for me is the zoom control. When making video I would like to have much more precise control that would make it possible to maintain a slow, steady zooming action through the full range of the lens. The zoom control on my FZ200 is non-linear and unpredictable, making this impossible. The result is often a slow start that almost immediately jumps rapidly to a neck-snapping zoom speed. The resulting uneven zooming action is very distracting and spoils any dramatic effect that a steady slow zoom might add to a video. A fast zoom between still images is fine, but a speedy zoom in the middle of a video scene is very 'unprofessional.'Another consequence of having so many features/functions is a large set of menus. It is fairly easy to maneuver through these menus but It does take valuable time to find what I want -- especially when it is something I don't use very often. When I do locate what I think I want there may be three or four or more options and my old brain can't remember which is what... especially if the options are abbreviations or numerical values. I've missed a number of photo ops while digging through menus.Fortunately, the automatic and semi-automatic ('Program') modes on this camera will yield acceptable (often surprisingly good) results in a wide range of conditions. So... I keep it set in fully automatic or in program mode most of the time, but especially when on a train, bus or anywhere conditions are changing rapidly and I want to be able to take advantage of more of those brief opportunities to capture a memorable image.Bottom line... I agree with other reviewers that the lens/feature/image-quality combination of this camera puts it near the top of the list for semi-compact \"point-and-shoot\" style cameras. To do much better would require going to an interchangeable-lens, SLR-style camera (and spending quite a lot more to have an equivalent range of lens capability).

Despite an initial hiccup of being sent an obviously pre-opened item (replaced flawlessly via Amazon), I have been very pleased with the camera so far.  Always keeping in mind that you won't be able to crop much more than your initial shot due to degraded PQ resulting from the crop, you can get some really nice \"professional-looking\" photos at a  600mm, 2.8 setting!  There are tons of features and options that are best explained in the Advanced Users Manual, and some great YouTube videos by Graham Houghton.  Along with the camera purchase, I bought the SanDisk Extreme 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s.  This card allows you to shoot great burst mode sets as well as AVCHD video at full 1080P 60 video without hiccups.  I'm set to test out the camera with outdoor sports shots soon and looking forward to the results.Upon Amazon reviewer's recommendations, I purchased the Lowepro Adventura 140 Camera Case which seems to be a good match for the FZ200.  Additionally, I purchased the Sigma DG 52mm Multi-Coated UV Filter as a standard layer of protection for the integrated Leica lens.If you don't want the burdens of DSLR, and don't mind the limitations of what amounts to a point-and-shoot on steroids, the lumix fz200 is still ahead of the pack in its class even in 2013.  Reportedly, Panasonic has no immediate plans to replace the FZ200 which made me finally pull the trigger with no regrets yet.I took off one star due to the initial opened item delivery by Amazon, no EVF/LCD sensor, and a bit of a cheap feel with the settings thumb wheel (even compared to my Kodak DX7590).Finally, a tip about the lens cover...I had initially been trying to pinch the inner tabs when attempting to attach it to the lens.  This made for a very clumsy experience.  I just realized that if you pinch from the outside circumference while attaching to the lens, it is a smoother, less clumsy experience (provided your fingers don't touch the lens/UV filter).", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "JIM C.", "ReviewID": "R3ESUQB2A8U2LS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a camera nut, love buying the latest camera gadget.

I have not had as much time as I would like to test it out, but I have had enough time with it to give some first impressions.  In short: I am very pleased!SOME CAVEATS: I have never had a camera in this class before, so I can't compare it against the competition.  However, I have owned many cameras over the years.  Currently, I own four others: two pocket cameras and two SLRs.  I'm a pretty serious enthusiast, and I know what I'm talking about.  But I'm not a pro, and I don't necessarily need all my photos to have pro-level image quality.BACKGROUND:  I was excited by the announcement of the Sony RX100 and the Panasonic FZ200.  I had a hard time deciding between the two.  In the end, I decided that I really wanted more zoom, and that my Canon S90 was close enough to the Sony RX100 to make the \"upgrade\" unjustifiable.FEATURES: The main attractions for me are that it's an all-in-one solution (I already have two SLRs; I don't want another ILC) with a 24X zoom lens and a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture, full manual controls, and RAW recording.  It's got lots of bells and whistles, too; but this is what matters to me.  The big down side is the small sensor.  But I was willing to give that up for f/2.8 at 600mm equivalent.SIZE:  The FZ200 is not small, by any means.  But given its feature set described above, and by comparison to an SLR, it's quite manageable.  And it fits very nicely in my hand.  I can't wait to use this on my next family trip to the zoo or museum, instead of lugging around and SLR and a couple of lenses.BUILD:  The camera is a little cheap by comparison to an SLR, but not bad at all.  My biggest complaint is that I wish it had a rubber eye cup.ERGONOMICS:  The camera feels good in your hand -- perfect size for me, in that sense.  The controls will take a little getting used to -- at least for me, because I've never owned a Panasonic before.  But other than that, they seem solid.  Everything is reasonably well accessible, and there are three programable buttons.  The scroll wheel can even be clicked in to switch its functionality: for example, in Aperture mode, you can toggle between control of the aperture and exposure compensation.  Nice touch.  So far, however, the side lever has not been as useful as I thought it would.MENUS:  The menu system is new to me, and doesn't seem as easy to navigate.  There are three top-level menu items, two with many pages of options.  It could benefit from reorganization.  But maybe it just takes getting used to.IMAGE QUALITY:  Not bad at all!  I haven't been able to process the RAW files yet -- a Lightroom update is on the way soon -- but the JPEGs look pretty nice OOC.  They're not SLR quality, of course.  But solid nonetheless.  Better than I expected, anyway.  And at the long end, I'm quite impressed.BIGGEST DRAWBACK SO FAR: I have been a little underwhelmed by the image stabilization so far.  I haven't been able to test it, so I can't say for sure; but my gut tells me that the photos suffer from motion blur a bit more often than I experience with other cameras.  It could simply be the effect of the long zoom.INITIAL CONCLUSION:  I'm very happy with my choice so far.  I think I'll enjoy this camera a lot.  It has the potential to become my \"main\" camera, with my SLRs being relegated to those times that I want to engage in studio or fine art photography (or what passes for either in my case). My true rating would be 4.5 stars, if I could give it.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera! Beyond my expectations!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R220CKVWK99F5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally graduated from a point-and-shoot, and over the past two months I've used the FZ200 to shoot pictures in the Mojave Desert, at sunny baseball games, portrait shots both indoors and outdoors, items for eBay and Craigslist, etc. I've also shot several hours of video (every pitch of about six Little League games).Through it all I've been very, very happy. The camera has surpassed my expectations in several ways. First of all, it's so FAST compared to point-and-shoots I've had in the past. Also, the long optical zoom is fantastic. I never thought I would need such a long zoom until I wanted to track outfielders chasing after balls way out in the outfield. And the optical image stabilization has meant that my videos don't have that amateurish bounce and jiggle they used to have.I like the dedicated video button, so even if you're in photo-taking mode, you can immediately start taking a video without changing modes.If you're tempted to buy a camera without a viewfinder: DON'T! Having a viewfinder has two big advantages. Obviously it allows you to see the  scene clearly even in bright sunlight, but also it lets you hold the camera much steadier than you would if you were holding it in front of you to look at the lcd screen.If you're tempted to buy a camera with just a 3X or 5X optical zoom: DON'T! There are many occasions when you will need the longer zoom, especially if you're shooting video. Sure, you could always buy a separate zoom lens for more $$, but in the heat of the action you're not going to want to swap lenses.There are a few ways it could be improved, however.- The zoom control wants to go full speed unless you're very very careful with how far you push it. I've finally gotten the hang of it, but when shooting video you would rarely want to zoom in or out quickly.- When in shooting mode I wish there were a \"delete last\" button so I could immediately delete the last photo or video.- No support for 24p \"cinema mode\" video.- No Internet or WiFi support, but I can live without that.The Case Logic DCB-304 carrying bag is just the right size for this camera. The camera fits in with lens cap and lens hood (in reversed, storage position) with the grip pointed up so you can grab it and pull it out fast. The bag also has room for the Vivitar 3 lens filter kit in its thin carrying case, and a spare battery in a side pocket.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Most Situations, But Not for Others", "Author": "Bobcrunch \"Cruncher\"", "ReviewID": "R1OL633SR2LCSG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a typical user, I'd rate five stars.

I'm amazed at all the features and the variety of preset shooting modes (HDR, vivid, manual, programmed, auto, etc.). You can spend hours (days?) learning all this camera has to offer, but most users can be up and running in less than an hour. There are many videos on YouTube about this camera: Especially see the Graham Houghton videos. He also publishes a free manual that you can download.The big plus: The f2.8 24x (24-600mm 35mm equivalent) zoom. It does not match the 50x of its contemporaries, but it does its job in low light with good zoom range.Most manual exposure adjustments (backlighting, etc.) can be easily done through the viewfinder by pressing/rotating the Back Control Wheel.This is a well thought-out camera.There has been a recent price drop at Amazon and many of the big NY vendors are out of stock. This make me wonder if Lumix will soon be coming out with an updated model. That can be good or bad.Not so PerfectDon't expect great results with close cropping or big blowups. The sensor is smaller than that of a typical SLR. The noise is noticeable at higher magnifications, especially for higher ISO (over 400). Don't expect the performance of a mid or high-end SLR in all situations.Its macro capability is adequate, but won't match an SLR with a macro lens.The auto stabilization is quite good in most situations, but use a tripod in low light at long zoom (good advice for any camera).Although it's a \"take one camera and leave the bag at home\" camera, I still have a small camera that I wear in a case on my belt that I take everywhere.

It seems that it would be good for both beginners and more experienced photographers if you take a little time to learn how to become more effective with it.The lens is outstanding.  With it I can take pictures most photographers with a DSLR cannot without a heavy investment in lenses.  But, I don't have to carry around at least three lenses, which is what I would have to carry to obtain the focal length range on a DSLR that this lens has.  Also, even if I were to purchase a 600 mm lens for a DSLR, it would have only an f4 aperture.  This lens gives me f2.8.The screen is very bright which helps if you are attempting to take low-light shots.  What you see on the screen is brighter than the scene without the camera.I have taken some fantastic macro pictures (A big thanks to the grasshopper that stayed put when my camera lens approached it.).  And I have taken pictures of a dance recital at a great distance in a dark auditorium without needing to use flash.  Wonderful!The price you pay for the versatility of the camera is that the sensor is small, so substantial enlargements are going to be less clear than if from a large sensor.

I am truly delighted with it!I would like to expand just a little on why I am so happy with my purchase.  My main hesitation in buying the Lumix DMC-FZ200 was that it \"only\" had a 24X zoom lens while the other two cameras that I was considering had 42 and 50X zoom lens, respectively.  I already had a 20X zoom camera that took nice pictures, but mostly only when the pictures were taken in very good light.  I really wanted a camera that took quality pictures more often and in more varied conditions.  What convinced me to buy the FZ200 was the fact that had a 2.8 aperture capacity THROUGHOUT its zoom range.  In the short two weeks that I have had this camera, I have already taken a number of very good to outstanding pictures, under varied conditions!  As a bonus I still can take pictures in rapid bursts, quickly, closely (macros), in RAW format, and more.The only negative that I have is that the camera comes with a digital manual, but no printed one.

EXCEPT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE!\"This is a marvelous product. It is not a \"pro\" product. Without some skill on your part, this device will not get you any accolades much less dates: you'll just have to continue fooling people into thinking you have wit and charm as you may be doing now.So why buy this thing?I have used my Lumix DMC-FZ200 for eight months and have captured thousands of images ... a few are very good. I was going to plunk down three times as much money for a mid-level DSLR. I'm glad I didn't. I'm very pleased with what I got.- The twelve Megapixel resolution may seem to be a bit weak compared to the offerings of other products. 12MP is more than adequate to fill with details the 8x10 prints you will want to make of those images you prize ... even after you do some cropping. That resolution allows the individual picture elements in the sensor to be a bit larger than they would otherwise be and just that much less susceptible to noise (which shows up as sparkles in the images). Don't be fooled by the megapixel/horsepower claims. If you want 16x20 prints, get another camera; you'll need another printer, too, so be prepared to spend five, no, TEN times as much money!- I looked also at the brighter, little brother: the LX7. It sports an F:1.4 lens that should offer some advantages in low light (I hate flash). That camera has only a display for a viewfinder while the FZ200 has both a display and an eye-level finder. Shooting in bright sunlight is much more comfortable with an eye-level finder. Adding the optional eye-level finder to an LX7 results in a purchase price nearly the same as that for the FZ200. The LX7 is a nice piece of jewelry, though.- The finder is electronic. A great idea: you see what you are likely to get. However, there is a lot of graininess and the image lags a fraction of a second behind the real action. Get used to it. At least, unlike a smartphone camera, the shutter release is pretty responsive: no more taking the picture AFTER the action is over.- In terms of out and out imaging capability, I took hand held shots of both the Orion nebula and of Jupiter. Yes, HAND HELD! M43 is discernible in the nebula image, and the Galilean satellites are recognizable in the planetary shot. The sheer number of glass surfaces in the lens dooms any serious astrophotography efforts. As a dumb experiment, the attempts were surprisingly successful, but the Lumix is no Astrophysics/SBIG/Takahashi replacement.Why this review, added to the hundred or so others?Some things that may not be mentioned in other reviews:- There exists a telephoto accessory (DMW-LT55) that extends the camera's capabilities. You'll need an adapter (DMA-LA7) to hang the LT55 on your camera. I borrowed such a set up and came to the conclusion that lugging another \"ton and a half\" of glass around is just plain dumb. At those magnifications, unexpected phenomena come into play ... low contrast due to water vapor and so on.- There exists a wide angle accessory that is mechanically compatible. DON'T USE IT! It can result in damage. If you need very wide angle images, learn how to use the panoramic feature. You'll look like a clown, twirling around, but you might get a nice shot.- Several of the features require multiple exposures. Mentioned already is the panoramic feature. The high-dynamic range feature yields images that show good detail in both the dark and light areas. However, any movement during the exposure results in strange pictures ... multiple hats on people, extra feet and/or hands. Sometimes the effect is just a fuzziness as if the focus were off. There is no substitute for proper composition and, maybe, a good tripod.- Learn to keep your fingers off of the lens barrel. If you zoom via the finger tab on the shutter release and notice that after stopping the zoom the camera keeps zooming, you have inadvertently pushed the lens barrel's zoom button. I do that a lot and, in vanity, blame the camera rather than myself.- Buy a protective filter for the lens. You might get some odd reflections at times (simply remove the filter when you take pictures of streetlights or stars), but know that it's a lot easier and cheaper to replace a cracked filter than to fix a cracked lens. I found that having such a filter made it easier to attach the lens cap. ...inexpensive insurance!- If you ever succeed in taking pictures of lightning or fireflies, let me know.- If you lose your battery charger, Amazon offers the Wasabi charger and batteries ($30). That's a nice product! Nothing special about it other than it's smaller and has a good price. I found my lost Panasonic charger and now I have two chargers and three batteries.- This camera does not have an intervalometer to support time lapse photography. No problem: Amazon offers a \"multi-function timer remote control\" (JJC TM) for about $20 that will fire the shutter on a regular basis. Like the Wasabi, the JJC is nicely priced; I bought it and it works just fine.- If you really want to do some time lapse (you are a masochist), get a power supply so as to avoid running down the camera's battery. I got the HQRP product just because it was cheaper than the Panasonic offering and because I had such a good experience with the Wasabi charger. Again, works fine and didn't break my bank account. Piece of advice to new time-lapsers: leave the scene and come back later; don't hang around as your movements will alter the lighting and make it appear that flashes are going off.- If you want to do underwater photography with this camera, there is a water resistant enclosure. DON'T. Nothing wrong with the enclosure; it's just that you can buy/rent a whole bunch of underwater capable cameras for a lot less money and they will work quite nicely and be easier to push around \"under the seas.\"- I haven't purchased the close up accessory in spite of making a variety of images of bees and flowers. No advice on this other than I haven't needed such a device.- I do like a good tripod. You can spend big bucks on one, and the cheapo tripods are virtually useless. I like the Vanguard Alta Pro 263AT (yeah, it's on Amazon) because it has a crazy boom that makes positioning the camera a lot easier. While not cosmologically priced, it's not cheap, either. ...nice toy in the mid hundred dollar range...- I'd love to see some kind of motion detector remote shutter release. That way, I could leave the camera set up to catch birds at a feeder while I lounge nearby instead of being crouched behind the viewfinder. There seem to be some software packages for laptop computers that can remotely control a Lumix; I haven't tried any of them.- Should you buy an insurance policy? I haven't but note that at least one of the negative reviews involves some kind of after purchase failure with no luck on a reimbursement.There ya have it ... hope this helped you make a decision.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "cam cam", "Author": "Adrian Reyes", "ReviewID": "R25EEQBVBUN3DE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a first time megazoom buyer, I was extremely pleased with the camera.

The telephoto is great and the F2.8 throughout the range keeps things nice and bright and allows for action shots even in less than stellar lighting. The lens does not do great with wide angle shots, but then again it was never designed for this purpose. The menu features are are easy enough to navigate and manually input and program setting for specific shooting. The auto setting is pretty good if you have to shoot on the fly and don't have time to make manual changes though. I do especially like the programable settings and function buttons. One problem I do have is that the flash and the autofocus assist lamp are place too close to the lens and because of the lens length and width, the lens body cast a shadow on the photographs for close up night shots. The articulated display is easy to use and seems sturdy enough, but is not a touchscreen as are many competitors, not a big deal to me. The electronic viewfinder is bright and easy to use, no problems there either. It's also significantly lighter, cheaper, and smaller than a comparable DSLR with a similar lens and camera features.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing at the price!", "Author": "Kudzu", "ReviewID": "RUUWHCUK5ED3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 is a consumer-level superzoom point-and-shoot digital camera built to a price point. There are necessarily compromises. This camera is all about the lens; and, what a lens it is! There are superzoom point-and-shoots with greater zoom range and maybe even with faster lens speed at maximum aperture, but there is nothing else out there, anywhere near this price, that has such a fast constant aperture (F2.8) from end-to-end. In my opinion, the ability to shoot at F2.8 from 25mm to 600mm (35mm equivalent) is more valuable in general usage than being able to zoom in to 1200mm, for example. Being able to purchase a camera with this superb Leica-badged lens in this price range is amazing and easily five stars!There are several compromises that need to be considered.The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200, like other cameras in its price range, has a plastic body and the build quality is strictly consumer-level. It is probably more than robust enough for its intended market and expected use. I guess what I am saying is, if you are used to handling pro-sumer and pro-level cameras, the FZ200 feels like a toy. The ergonomics and handling, for its size, are excellent.The sensor used in the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 is a mixed blessing. Like other cameras at this price and even above, the photo sensor is very small. It is the small size of the sensor that makes possible the lens that is the camera's greatest asset. A larger sensor would necessitate a much larger, heavier and vastly more expensive lens to perform as the 24X Leica F2.8 constant aperture lens on this camera does. The downside is that the small sensor just does not capture enough image data for making enlarged prints of those images. The pictures are excellent viewed on computer monitors, even on large monitors at high resolution. Just do not expect to print large, sharp photos on paper.If you have done any research on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200, you already know that the documentation provided by Panasonic with the camera leaves a LOT to be desired. Fortunately, there is an ready solution to this serious deficiency at little cost. An Englishman, Graham Houghton, has produced a series of YouTube videos specifically on the FZ200 that are excellent. He also has a photography blog with a section on the camera and, best of all, he has written a manual for the FZ200 that is an example of how a camera user's manual should be written. All of the resources developed are made freely available on the Internet and the author tactfully asks that you make a voluntary contribution for their use so that he can continue his very productive and beneficial efforts. Since the resources he has created will significantly increase your understanding of your camera and how to use it to obtain better photos and videos, a $10 or $25 contribution would help Graham Houghton and make you feel good, too!The digital camera market is extremely competitive and things change quickly, but the FZ200 is the class leader at this time and will still be a very capable camera for a long time.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great compact digital camera", "Author": "Information Security Instructor", "ReviewID": "R14YHX7D8TQ127", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as I was going on a vacation and did not want to lug my Canon 5D and multiple lens with me.  I wanted something inexpensive and reasonably small.  This camera strikes a very good balance and can be amazing.  I love the constant aperture 2.8 lens and the huge zoom lens (1200mm).  Together, the lens is its best feature.  However, if you look at the raw images, there is noticeable chromatic / lens distortion (i.e. purple fringing) and light fall off in the corners.  I shoot the Canon 5DMIII and am use to professional grade lens, so this may bother others less.  If you shoot JPG (which is probably 95% of photographers), this WILL NOT BE AN ISSUE.  Panasonic has done a great job tweaking the camera software to adjust for the chromatic distortion and light fall off in the corners when shooting at F/2.8.  Comparing the RAW images versus the JPG images, you can see that Panasonic automatically crops the photo to clip the corners and applies noise reduction to the images.  Most of the time, the default is just fine.  However, I use Adobe Lightroom and prefer to manually adjust color, crop, and luminesce (noise) to achieve great looking photographs.Overall, this is a great, inexpensive camera.  I wish the sensor had better low light performance at ISO 1600 and was slightly higher megapixel (18 vs 12).

I decided this time to move up to a bridge camera, and researched multiple options. I ended up choosing this one primarily due to the 600mm f2.8 Leica lens, plus the overall favorable reviews.I have been extremely satisfied with this camera. The image quality and flexibility have greatly impressed me. This camera has a lot of features and setting, but the manual that comes with it leaves quite a bit to be desired. After purchasing, my first activity was to watch Graham Houghton's YouTube video series for the FZ200, which provides useful advice and setting suggestions to get high-quality results from the camera. My only issue at this point was a bit of washed-out look to the sky on bright days due to the fixed aperture, but I was able to mostly mitigate this by adding a Hoya circular polarizing filter when I was taking photos in bright daylight in order to deepen the blues of the sky. I had also tried the Panasonic ND8 filter which worked for some scenes, but found the polarizing filter gave me more flexibility overall.I recently took the camera with me on a vacation to Oahu, and I have no complaints about the results. The zoom gave me the flexibility I needed to capture and frame the photos the way I wanted them. The auto-focus worked flawlessly, although it was noticeably slower at the highest zoom levels - not enough that I ever missed a shot, but noticeable. From flowers high in the trees, to bright and vibrant beach scenes, to sunsets and fireworks on Waikiki, I was able to repeatedly get excellent results out of this camera.For a seasoned professional, this camera can be a lighter-weight auxiliary camera; and for an amateur photographer who wants more than what can be found in a low-end point-and-shoot, this can be an excellent introduction to more powerful camera features while still providing simpler options to get quick good results.

So far, I am very impressed and pleased with it. It's lightweight mid-size, deep grip, easy to handle features makes it a great all around camera. With this camera, I believe 80-95% of the population should never feel the need to upgrade to a full dslr. In fact, I bet many who bought into the dslr category may wish they had gone this route instead. The size, weight and need for additional lenses can take away from its overall enjoyment. In fact, you might find that camera in the closet or left in the car when you wish you had carried it along. In my opinion, keep the quick, light portability camera in your smartphone, and go for a quality bridge camera like this one for the rest of your photography. Don't get mesmerized by how many mega-pixels a camera has. That is only part of the equation. The larger file size of high mega-pixel photos can really bog down and slow down your computer also making the storage of photos another problem. The versatility of the FZ200 is amazing from the tripod mounted, full zoom pictures I got of the lunar eclipse a couple of weeks ago to close-ups of wild flowers and apple blossoms beginning to bud. I have also captured some amazing, brilliant sunsets and silhouette nightscapes. I love it!If you know your way around a digital camera you will have zero difficulty navigating around this camera. Everything is right where it should be. The menus are fast and logical. The viewfinder is sharp and vivid. The fold out tilt/swivel lcd is super handy for overhead, low, ground angle shots. The full range 2.8 lens is amazing. That is really important if you need to maintain high shutter speeds for action shots and like natural light and low light photography. Who likes blurry pictures? Nobody. It is also really important with close-up photography.To enjoy this camera all the more, you should have a good understanding about \"depth of field\" - controlling what is in focus and out of focus in the frame. If you don't understand the settings, you could end up with some pictures that have the wrong subject in or out of focus. \u0010This wonderful feature could actually be discouraging for some people who are just looking for a simple, higher-end, point and shoot. Take the time to learn how the auto focus works and the various modes that are available to you.The only thing I wish this camera had was a manual focus ring and manual zoom. I like those features from my slr background and that of a dslr, but I am willing to sacrifice them for the other outstanding benefits of this camera which obviously includes price/investment considerations. The only bridge camera that I know that has manual zoom capability is the Fujifilm HS50EXR and the Lumix DMC-FZ30. I almost went that direction just for that manual lens capability, but overall, I chose the low light capability and other review qualities of the Lumix DMC-FZ200. I also wish this camera would not retract the lens when it goes into sleep mode.  From the wrench menu, you can set the \"lens resume\" feature to the \"on\" position so it remembers your previous zoom setting any time the camera shuts off. It only takes about 2 seconds for the camera to resume your previous settings and you are back in action which is super cool. You can also go into \"economy\" and adjust the sleep mode to \"off\" or change it to a longer or shorter idle time setting.As for this camera, I have not done much video with it yet, but from other reviews I have read, it rates very well there too. Again, the f/2.8 lens outperforms all the rest in natural light situations.So, in short, no buyers remorse here. I would buy this camera again in a second. I hope this was helpful.

It threw me for a loop as I tried to learn quickly how to operate it within the first day of receiving the camera. If you get one, take plenty of time to just explore what's under the hood. Meanwhile, I'll try to avoid explaining all the crazy settings (like toy and 3D) and focus on what I really enjoyed the most about this model:HS Video (high speed). The North American camera will shoot mp4 files *without sound* at 120fps in 720p, or 240fps in VGA. I love the quality of the camcorder files in slow motion, and you can really crank it back well with a strong post-production app. I'll add a short clip to show the slow motion.Off-camera flash images can be captured at a flash sync of 1/1000th. That's terrific for daylight flash photography. I used an old Nikon flash set at 1/4 power (the dedicated shoes won't match for in-camera meter reading). Add wireless remotes and you're really taking advantage of what the FZ200 can provide.I like the thumb wheel's ability to be pressed, allowing you to switch between shutter speeds, f-stops and exposure values.This camera is major-major silent, when you cut out the shutter sound effect. I can bang off a set of images and no one would even notice. Great for true candid shooting.The 60-second long exposure is terrific. Shoot at night, or get an ND1000 filter (about ten stops dark), lock your camera on a stream, waterfalls, clouds, or street life, and shoot some really stunning images in broad daylight.The panorama option is pretty cool and does a nice job of stitching images together seamlessly, in-camera while you turn during a photo capture. It can be used to shoot better photos of tight spaces, like for real estate. You can go left, right, up or down, and the camera bursts a ton of images as you move. The single stitched image can be watched as a pan shot in-camera, and the image is a thin picture; one 360-degree image I shot was processed in-camera to 39 inches long!While shooting certain videos, you can shoot a number of still images. They aren't full resolution but they look nice at ISO 100.The 2.5mm mini plug mic input (smaller than the typical 3.5mm input) is a gem. It's necessary for any camera that shoots video with sound. Add a microphone for better sound. Add a wireless or bluetooth microphone for really nice, pro-quality sound.I love the flip-out LCD. That's one thing I really miss even now, on my Nikon D3 and D3s.The camera uses 52mm filters. These are the most common size, so they can be decently priced. Get a UV or skylight for lens protection, but try adding a circular polarizer for controlling unwanted ambient reflections on skin or water. Or get that ND1000 filter.I like the 5.5 fps constant HQ image capture, and really like the 12-frame, one-second image burst at high quality. The 12fps is only 12 frames, then the camera won't fire until you stop squeezing that trigger.So, why four, and not five stars??The main reason I docked a star from this small camera with large potential, is that the image sensor is still stuck in the last decade. The image quality simply hasn't grown up, like my taste in good quality imagery has. I will add some 100 percent crop pictures shot at ISO 100 to demonstrate what I mean. The camera is short of perfect for me, because I must limit how I can shoot with it.I had the Lumix FZ18, FZ20, FZ28, FZ35, TZ1, TZ3, TZ5, and now this FZ200. My first Lumix went with me to cover Hurricane Katrina. I truly pushed that camera beyond its intended use by shooting inside a darkened Superdome. Using the FZ200, I expected a much better level of image quality in low light situations, especially with the constant f/2.8 lens. But I'm rather disappointed, even with the quality I had expected with shooting at ISO 100 in full sunlight. I can see the jpeg artifacts and digital noise waiting to ooze out in low light or higher ISO ratings. Many people don't care to enlarge pictures and the camera is designed for that. It's for people who want to reach farther than their smartphone will capture. This reaches very, very far.I have to say that while some of you might want to reconsider whether to bump the ISO beyond 800, many others will be satisfied with the look of the photos  at even ISO 3200. Competition has stiffened with the expanding M43 (Micro Four Thirds) format, and with how camcorder cameras now are working on making still images better. Chips are getting larger and better, to yield higher detail and better image quality in low light. I can imagine that trying to manufacture a compact 24x optical zoom at f/2.8 would be impossible. But cutting corners by using an inferior image chip (Panasonic's choice considering budget) was not such a good idea. I'm still trying to find the right settings between the camera's noise reduction, sharpness, and those features in Photoshop, but I feel a bit disappointed sometimes, especially with telephoto shots.I needed to get all that off my chest because that was the most glaring issue with the FZ200. Some may balk at the criticism, but I'm not only being fair but also relaying the most complete information I can provide to give the discriminating consumer the type of information needed to make an informed decision. Many people don't even care to make 8x10- or greater-size enlargements. But others are looking for a camera that can provide pristine detail, even for small images. This review can help everyone who have questions or concerns about some of the features that Panasonic is selling this camera as.While the camera can try to automatically adjust sound, it won't let me choose what to adjust the audio I'm recording from an external microphone.The small chip won't let me create a more shallow depth of field as some might like.I can't adjust focus when shooting HD video.The flash always fires at least twice, no matter what the flash setting. You can't use it to set off optical flash slaves.These bones I've picked aside, the FZ200 is still a super camera packed in a small body, so small that they couldn't possibly add a much larger chip to get finer image results in the higher ISO ratings. All of these additional features make me happy that I have this added to my equipment. I'm also going to try using the 12fps setting for some football games and other daytime sports.I shot some high speed video at 120fps of the jet I was traveling in, and recently captured some football and basketball clips that I plan to upload here.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "large zoom camera", "Author": "Mickeylangs", "ReviewID": "RVVRTCC1B0WG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the cost to get a 600 zoom.

I still think the FZ150 is probably the best, but the FZ200 misses that top position by only a hair. There isn't a great deal of difference between the FZ150 and FZ200, but the constant f2.8 lens of the 200 and its greatly improved electronic view finder are most notable. The lens is very good to excellent at f2.8 at all degrees of zoom, but does produce a hint of softness in the corners and just a little more chromatic aberration. Never the less, producing a lens that good at such a wide aperture with such an extreme zoom range is a remarkable feat and made even better with the internal processor of the camera. The real telling is in the image quality. It is not DSLR quality because of the small sensor, but for most uses the images are fully capable of excellent 11x14 inch enlargements and quite good even to 16x20 inches. Thus the images are able to handle a fair amount of cropping so long as huge enlargements are not expected. The combination of an FZ150 and an FZ200, is probably about as good as it gets and still have a weight factor that is highly manageable in the field. One can be fitted with macro attachments or a telephoto auxiliary lens and the other left plain. Thus one can avoid the fiddly process of adding those attachments without adding a great deal more weight or bulk. A camera bag with both cameras and attachments may only weigh about 4 pounds which is far, far less than the weight of equivalent DSLR equipment and one gets a 600mm f2.8 capability for ounces that would replace a similar DSLR lens that would be like carrying around a good sized astronomical telescope and might require you to mortgage your house to purchase. The quality of such a DSLR lens would not be all THAT much better than what the little FZ200 produces. And 9 times out of 10 you can use the FZ200 at full zoom without a tripod, something that would be next to impossible with an f2.8 600 mm lens on a DSLR. These small bridge cameras that work like a DSLR are amazing cameras that can fulfill virtually all reasonable photographic opportunities and still produce excellent quality images. I have been doing photography as a hobby and as a semi-pro for a half century and have used cameras from point and shoot film and digital to the 4X5 view camera with sheet and roll film. Medium format digital comes close to 4x5 quality at a price that will give you heart trouble, but for 99% of my uses and probably for most everybody else, the bridge camera can do it all. It does have its limitations, but they are actually slight. The FZ series are clearly the best of the bridge cameras. And as a bonus, you even get good quality video if you are into that. I'm not, but the video the camera produces is very good.

Since I really don't want to be bothered with having to change lenses all the time, the super-zooms are attractive, and since I have been in love with my little Panasonic ZS5 for the past 3-4 years, I was hoping the Panasonic super-zoom would be an easy transition. I was not mistaken.After two weeks of using the FZ200 and taking about 1000 photos, I can confirm that it is a superior camera. This camera is FAST - you should see the photos of the PSU women's basketball games I have taken. And the F2.8 widest aperature applies throughout the huge zoom range - a super-zoom first. The colors are fantastically realistic - you should see the Happy Valley sunsets and sunrises I have taken. The focus is nearly instantaneous and precise - you should see some of the macros I have taken. The manual focus is easy to use and spot on - you should see some of the difficult close-ups over water and ice I have taken (it's hard for AF to focus with an ice background). The stabilization is the best I have ever seen - you should see some of the maximum zoom hand-held photos I have taken.It is light. It comes with a lens hood. The front of the lens if threaded so it will take filters and super macro add-ons. It allows you to store 4 custom settings. It had HDR. It feels solid and fits nicely into the hand. It has a 3\" articulated, high resolution LCD. It has a large, high resolution view finder. It has 3 programmable function buttons. The battery seems to last forever. It has so many ways to correct or edit photos that you will be learning how each of these things works for years to come. It is quiet. It looks professional.As you can see, I could go on and on...and I'm not a Panasonic or Amazon employee.Now a few drawbacks; after all, nothings perfect.I'm replacing the FZ200 I got with a new one because when I make a lot of setting changes quickly it gets overloaded, locks up, and needs to be restarted - not a huge problem but irritating sometimes. As a previous reviewer said, it is strange that Panasonic didn't put a more detailed Quick Menu on this camera like the ZS5 has. Perhaps that's because a lot of those functions are located in buttons on the camera body. It takes a little effort to remember that you set the AF,Macro, and Manual focus on the lens barrel instead of in the software - different from little point & shoots. So far I have not found a case like they used to make for the old film SLRs. I'd rather have a case instead of a \"bag\" as advertised on the webpage. And...if you're coming from a small P&S;, it's an adjustment to learn where all the controls are on the camera body.But it's worth it.

I spent several days going through all the camera review sites, narrowing down my list to this camera. Decided not to go overboard with zoom length, 24 times is enough for me. Too long is hard to hold stable even with the stabilization turned on. Easy to control zoom speed and length.I especially like the adjustable diopter TTL viewing as I do not need my reading glasses to see the external view screen. I can see everything in focus. YYYEEESSSS!!!! Not using the external viewing screen saves battery time. When I do use the external viewing screen, I do like how it can be rotated for viewing from the front of the camera, making a perfect selfie very easy.Dial control photo selection method shows up in the viewing screen. I like how it is lightweight, not a drag around my neck after hours of carrying it when sightseeing. Flash works well however, there are times I wish it would come up on its own, I'll get used to it.Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera. Easier then when I had a heavier film type SLR with interchangeable lenses. Picture quality is fine for me, mainly taking pictures on my trips, around the city, and home.

When I decided to step up a notch, I started researching the net. I had several Minolta lenses from my older SLR's so I was mainly looking at the Sony Alpha, since the mounts were the same as my lenses. My alternate thought was to forget those bulky lenses and look at the Lumix DMC-FZ200. After all, having a f2.8, 25-600mm lens built into one compact design seemed the best way to get back into the photography game.  For me, that seems to have been the right decision, this camera just keeps on surprising me!

The camera's ability to gather light in dark or shady locations is excellent, and its autofocus is also outstanding.  It struggles a bit with a small bird in a tree to sort out the branches compared to the bird, but with persistence, I can generally get a focused picture, though I waste a few shots on very blurred ones.  Its ability to take panoramic shots and put them together all by itself is just magical, there is no other way to put it.  It has point and shoot ease and intuitive controls, with lots of presettings for the various types of photography one might do.  While many users might not need 12 megapixels, I find it useful when I am taking a small bird from some distance away, and I need to magnify considerably to see the bird or frame a decent picture.  The photographs maintain clarity through considerable magnification.  The macro function is also easy to use and the pictures are delightfully sharp of insects or flowers.  The camera is light weight, and makes a good choice for carrying out into the field for nature trips; I have a good slr, but with a long lens it is hard to hold steady, and tiring to hold, in addition to my binoculars and a day pack.  The lumix delivers a picture that is actually a little better than comparable ones for the slr at similar distances, as the slr did not produce clear pictures at full range and needed a lot of light when the telephoto was on, so I needed to up the speed, and often got grainy photos.

I found each camera to be an improvement on the previous, & the quality of the images adequate to very good, depending on conditions. I also find the controls to be intuitive so I rarely need to take my eye off of my subject when I'm taking a shot.  It was always my intention to at some point upgrade to a DSLR, but the convenience & quality of the FZ range (not to mention the cost & weight of an equivalent DSLR system) has kept me from doing so. That said, I always felt I was making a few compromises - mainly in terms of low light performance & the inability to add an external flash, macro lens or remote shutter release. The majority of my photography is macro, & the addition of a Raynox DCR converter Raynox DCR 250 Super Macro Snap On a couple of years ago has increased the range & flexibility of my photography immensely.Enter the FZ200 - this camera has a similar intuitive layout to the FZ40 but feels more robust. The pop-up flash is much more powerful than previous models (actually a downside for me as taking night time macros it is a little too powerful, even with the exposure comp maxed out so I'm experimenting with opaque tape over the flash lens) & it also has a hot-shoe enabling the addition of an external flash unit - I've added a Nissin Speedlite Di 466 FT  B003LWH156 which will be a huge improvement for people shots. The biggest improvement though is having an F2.8 max aperture throughout the focal ranges - I've been taking night-time macros without flash by using a small flashlight to light my subjects & the images are more than acceptable. I take a lot of low light shots & FZ200 allows me to do this at reasonably low ISOs, so the images are much less grainy than the previous models I've owned. The lens quality appears to be excellent, & even at full zoom there looks to be minimal degradation of images at the edges - an issue with the other models.Although obviously image quality from a bridge camera will never completely match that of a good DSLR due to the smaller sensor size, unless you are going to be looking to sell large format prints that shouldn't be an issue. I've had several photos I've taken with my previous Lumix FZs featured by National Geographic on their website, & I've won contests in competition with many SLR users. I know there is a certain amount of snobbery around bridge cameras like this (even though many DSLR users I know never take them out of the Automatic setting!) but for me their quality is outstanding for the price & they are so much more convenient & flexible (especially with the addition of the snap-on Raynox macro converter) - I never miss a shot because I'm busy changing a lens!", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera ~ amatuers to professionals!", "Author": "C.

Pictures are amazing and video is amazing, but mine has been used and abused and it was time to upgrade.  I was excited that this camera could take pictures during video plus there are so many upgrades from my FZ35.  The FZ35 has me spoiled because the zoom is super quiet and therefore I'm used to zooming during my movies without issue.  The zoom on the FZ200 is so loud that it can be heard it all movies I took.  Very annoying, especially when it wasn't an issue with my older camera.  The pictures taken during video are very poor quality and basically unusable (perhaps I should have expected this, and it did say that in the manual once I received the camera, but looking at the description I just assumed the pictures during video would be the same quality).  I mainly used this in intelligent mode, but I took over 500 pictures in a room with decent lighting.  Sometimes it would ask for the flash, which I would turn on, and then the pictures were over exposed.  Without the flash everything was under exposed.  Most pictures were blurry, had red eye, or very poor color.  Even outside and in other rooms of my house the pictures were not impressive.  I'm a novice obviously, but I know what I could get from my FZ35 and everything was a step backwards.

I ended up ordering a different camera. (the Nikon D3200)  However, I'll review the things I can.First may I give great big kudos to Amazon.  The few times I have ever had a problem with a product their customer service has been excellent.  It's that service that will keep me coming back.  They make things easy and effortless and are quick to take care of things.While my camera had a defect, and I barely used it, I think this would be a good camera for many.  It's what is known as a bridge camera - between a Point and Shoot (P&S;) and a DSLR.  I think it's a good option for those who are leary of a DSLR for fear it's too much camera.  The Lumix works in straight auto mode.  But there are some settings if you want to be a little more adventurous.  There is room to grow...or a little anyway.My main reason for selecting this camera in the first place is that I remember how heavy my Canon D10 was.  I am going on a trip next year to Europe and didn't want to lug a heavy camera and deal with changing lenses.  But I wanted better quality than a P&S.;  This camera gets glowing reviews.I only was able to do a few pictures that came out, but the ones that did were really, really nice.  (again, this was a mechanical problem and not something that you would deal with in all likeliness - just I got a defective one)  Even though my P&S; is a higer resolution, I could see the difference in quality.  It isn't always about MP (megapixels) it's the quality of the lens.  This camera looks like it has decent glass.If I'd gotten a working model, I would have kept it and I think I'd have been mostly happy with it.  For awhile....but I know I would have found myself still wanting a DSLR.  If weight and complication of a DSLR is a major factor in one's buying decision, then do some more research.  Go to stores and hold a model of various cameras in your hands.I found that the Nikon D3200 isn't much heavier than the FZ200 was.  You can use the kit lens they tend to come with and never change lenses.  You can run it on full auto mode.The FZ200 is a pricey camera, so the price point is the same.  I actually got the D3200 for LESS.I hope this doesn't sound like I am criticizing the FZ200.  I think many will be happy with it.  It looks impressive for those who want to look like you have a decent camera.  It looks easy to use and it's lightweight.  Looks like it can take good sharp photos.  There is  some room to grow in learning to use it out of auto mode.The point here is to really think about what you want out of a camera.  If you are pretty sure you'll never (or rarely) run it out of auto mode but want more than a P&S;, this is probably a good choice for you.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, a bit expensive", "Author": "Alejandro", "ReviewID": "RBVK7RFGP0N77", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is very good camera, but I thing is a bit expensive.

The zoom is amazing - and F2.8 throughout is ideal - but I agree with other reviewers that the JPEG images are odd/poor.  Even at ISO-100 in good light - the resulting JPEG images are disappointing.  I have not played with the RAW - do not really have time for that.  But if I compare the JPEGS from this FZ200 sensor to the DX sensor in my Nikon 5200 (or my Nikon D90) or to my old Lumix 4/3's GF1 sensor - this sensor still feels like just a point-n-shoot sensor IMHO.  Which is to be expected!  So having a 600 mm zoom at F2.8 is great - but do not expect miracles.  Not that any purchaser of this camera would expect miracles.

The camera can be set to blink for blown out highlights during image review which makes it easy to know when I need to adjust exposure compensation.Menus are very long, but I'm not sure how one could change the menus to access some items more quickly.My only major dislike was the difficulty in getting another Panasonic battery - backordered for 6 weeks. For a major trip, I couldn't wait for a second Panasonic, so I bought a pair of Wasabi batteries which combined cost less than half as much as a Panasonic and delivered about 40% more photos (one Wasabi gives about 65-70% as many photos as one Panasonic).After 5000 photos it's still taking excellent photos.I was able to take \"closeup\" photos of flying birds with greater success than my previous cameras which suggests very good tracking AF.There may be a little more flare than some of my prior cameras when the subject is backlit.There have been a few odd occurrences which apparently relate to the camera \"brain\". A couple of times, the camera zoomed out by itself, and I had to \"reboot\" by turning it off and back on. Twice, it would not focus when I pressed the shutter release half way. A couple of times it would focus but not shoot when I pressed the shutter release: one time it shot on the second or third try, and another time, I had to \"reboot\".

These electronic zoom images are really uncropable at all, and mediocre at best. But when compared to my 24mp D3200 with a Nikon 28-300 lens at 300 cropped to the equivalent size, the Lumix is better! Now the bad news. Focus is slow on the super zoom even with non-moving subjects. And in some cases the focus hunts like crazy. My shots of the moon were the best I have ever gotten. Even better than my D800 with the 300 mm zoom. More bad news. Typical of small sensor, light weight cameras, this one is plasticky and hard to use with many features buried in menus.

The 25-600mm f2.8 lens is excellent and helps keep the shutter speed up and ISO down on telephoto shots.  What I am really liking lately is the HD slow-motion video.  I have been recording golf swings in slow motion, which really helps to see where I can improve.I like the hot shoe on this so that I can use my old Vivitar flash (in manual mode, though).

I keep hitting it and it moves down to MF mode and I have to click it up to AF or AF Macro to get the camera to take a picture.That's it, I love all the great features on this camera. Oh another great thing is the screen in the back, you can leave it in the covered mode and take pictures through the viewfinder, or open it up and take pictures looking at it from different angles.  I like you can close it up and it won't get scratched up like a ton of other cameras I have owned.You won't go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "good value", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"textbookmasters\"", "ReviewID": "R14S8XE9UM3RBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is an excellent camera for someone that needs a guick way to take great pictures of the kids and outdoors.

I shot RAW with both cameras as well, and after normal lightroom PP, they both created excellent results for 1/2\" sensors.The only thing that sets this camera apart for image quality is the depth of field and shutter speed.  A constant f/2.8 give it the ability to be 4x faster at full telephoto than any other super-zoom camera on the market!  Although not nearly as nice as a dslr, the large aperture does give a better looking bokeh for a 1/2\" sensor.I give it only 4 stars because of the build quality.  It feels cheap, very cheap, especially if you compare it to the Fuji.  The zoom is on a servo with no manual ring option (WHY? I hate that!), and creates a little bit of noise while zooming in and out.

Perhaps the camera needed a little bit of use first to 'break in' (as with a new pair of shoes). Must say, the FZ200 is quite an improvement over the FZ35, which was so worn that it is now at the bottom of my trash bin waiting to go out to the dumpster. On to the proper review (three paragraphs, which the following should be the REAL review)...The FZ35 was already a great camera for what it was, and the FZ200 has some very nice improvements. Keep in mind that the actual successor to that model is the FZ70, whereas the predecessor to the FZ200 is the FZ150. The zoom is 6X greater on the FZ200, better photo quality (less yellowing/color smudging at higher ISO), very good low light performance, and autofocus and taking pictures is fast like a DSLR. Well, close to it anyways. You have Full HD video (some ghosting in low light probably due to the lens mechanics), interface like LX7, and improved sound quality during movie recording. No microphone jack like if you want to use one from a boom box, per se, but a remote mic input for a proprietary mic you mount atop the hot shoe.RAW photo quality is about the same as the JPEG, just a smidgen worse, actually. Noise is the same. No point in using RAW, as an identical scene indoors versus the two formats, blah. However, the RAW on the FZ35 was quite bad compared to the JPEG, so at least improvement here. After all, RAW format is best for cameras with larger sensor, as in a DSLR. Also, the low light multi-frame (as in the Handheld Twilight on Sony CyberShot) is unnecessary and does not seem to work well. When you can just change the mode dial to Program and just takes the shot, which works better. That is why this camera is four (not five) stars.Best thing is that you have the constant aperture of 2.8, which is something you find on Sony DSC-RX10, about twice the MSRP from the Panasonic. Even the digital zoom on the FZ200 is quite good, just like a fuzzy interpolation. Not the aliased blocky digital zoom on early P&S; cameras. Larger in size, and a bit heavier, but the excellent battery life is most welcome. Recommended? Yes. Take care now.*** Original review (originally two stars)***Received the FZ200 from eBay two weeks after purchase. Took it out of the box this evening and set it up. Really nice looking with all sorts of controls. Does not have mic jack, but is remote jack for external accessory. Do not bother with the expensive microphone. The internal microphones are camcorder quality, like those found in the professional 3CCD line (I have done some TV studio work). You also have the hot shoe mount, unlike the FZ35. Zoom is more with constant f/2.8 at 24X zoom. Viewfinder is OK but the resolution on the flip-out LCD monitor is far from the current standard (230,000 as on the FZ35). Viewfinder is larger but still the same antagonizing low-res, maybe 460,000 pixels? Colors on the display and viewfinder are very nice though. Flip-out display is tight and quite difficult to just quickly open. Something where Canon Rebel excels. I really like my T3i for that reason, but beside the point!Why am I giving this camera two stars? Sounds a bit harsh, but to be honest, the only improvement given the modest amount of testing indoors and outdoors, is that around ISO 400 and 800, the color artifacts (yellow and green blotches) are minimal on the FZ200, in contrast to the FZ35. However, I was not impressed with the auto-focus hunting. Taking a video in low-light is a joke, but the image stabilization does work quite well in low light as it is a faster processor. Still, image quality wise, it is still very weak in detail as the FZ35; the small sensor and 12 megapixels cannot give you a clear reading. A shampoo bottle with a 16 point font size taken from a dozen feet away at ISO 400 is barely readable. Even at base ISO 100, the 12 point font on the body cream bottle is no dice for being readable. What is quite shocking is that the FZ200 has substantially better JPEG processing than LX7. I actually like LX7 than the FZ200 for the video though. That REALLY looks great. Not on the FZ200. Why?Very poor compression. Severe artifacts in low light, and even in good indoor lighting, it hunts so badly that you wonder how Panasonic could even manufacture such a defective system. Maybe those who are not technical experts or are use to inexpensive point-and-shoot cameras would think that if a VHS looks great, then this camera is better. Yes, better. Again, beside the point.Of course, you cannot get good photos taken in video mode. 3.5 megapixels as in the LX7? Yes, again, speaking of bad image quality, this gimmicky feature is not preferred by the majority of the population. Even Sony CyberShot gives the shot the look of badly incorrect settings applied to a small photo enlargement with a fractal program on a PC. Picaso, anyone?What I do not understand is how the FZ35 can keep the video focused better in low light than the FZ200 does. Yes, the old model hunts, but only occasional. Whether you use the full range of the zoom or not, the hunting is a problem. Even in good lighting. Now the Intelligent Auto + is a gimmick. The hype does not live up. Did some testing, nothing really mattered. You get the icon saying that it suggests helping with macro performance.That said, this is not worth the near $600 (I paid a lot less for that, thankfully). Consider the FZ35. I really liked that camera, and gave it four stars back in the day. It is badly worn but still works. Now the new model will probably just collect dust in my closet.Sorry, I really wanted to like the product. Why is it every time I go to other photography sites the image quality is so much better than the one I bought? Could it be the pre-production model (prototype?) is optimized where the final versions are dumbed down?I do not care. It is Sony A6000 this summer. If you want something with better image quality for the MSRP the FZ200 goes for, consider the Nikon P7700 or P7800. Nikon's imaging technology is far more mature than Panasonic. This is because Panasonic does not change their sensor technology. Not a good move. In the real world, a good lens cannot compensate for it. You have to update or re-engineer a sensor so that the photo-diode arrays are optimized. Still, a larger sensor in a large zoom camera as this would jack up the price, and I have yet to see one. IMO, you are better off with a DSLR at this size, but to get the kind of zoom at constant aperture, it would be cost prohibitive for most people.Yes, on to the positives. Well built like the FZ35. A bit heavier but feels durable. Very fast taking a photo but you want to set the review to zero to take photos sooner. Menu system not as good as on FZ35 but simple, quite easy to navigate being familiar with the older model. (Want to make it clear that the FZ200 is not in the same league as the FZ70; the latter is the 'lower-end' that is comparable to the FZ35, many cameras of which do not have the hot shoe.) Battery charges faster than most competitors like Sony (they are always slow but I do not mind, have some spares).I am done with Panasonic cameras like these. Maybe the Micro Four-Thirds system would be a better investment. Auto-focus and video quality could have been much better, and a camera in its price range should have had phase detection, but this somehow is misleading. Fuji XQ1, another camera I do not like because its focusing and exposure are mysteriously erratic. On to Sony A6000 this summer.

Photos looked yellowish or weirdly white. Outside shots were no better. Photos looked washed out, even in good light. I had to touch up every single picture in software. Now granted, I'm no expert photographer. But, I've had less expensive cameras take better pictures than this one. Aside from the poor quality, the camera was just not user friendly. It features a manual flash. You have to actually push a button to get it to open, even when needed. I found that annoying.

What I like about the FZ200: It is lighter and smaller, the zoom range is terrific and it makes good snapshots in nearly any \"room lighting\" situation without using flash. Somewhat negative features: the build quality seems, well, a little flimsy, although nothing has actually failed so far. At extreme zoom the quality of images tends toward \"muddy\" or blurred out. The optics of the eye-level viewer are poor quality. What I hate about it: it is impossible to tell, either with the eye-level viewfinder or the tilt-out viewer, when an image is in focus. The many small control buttons are easy to press without realizing it. The most irritating feature: the zoom and focus are done by motors. The FZ30 had an excellent all-manual zoom, but the FZ200 has only a button, resulting in very slow and sloppy zoom control.

I've owned dozens of digital cameras and and have never seen this kind of obtrusive noise. If you want to print up to 5x7 without cropping then this may be all you need.  I'm not about to keep this camera knowing if I'm on vacation and have a chance for that perfect shot that I may never get again that I may have regrets when there are much better set ups for your $500.00.  Take a look at the Sony A37 Kit with 18-55 55-250. It's about the same price and if you look at noise and picture quality it's not even a contest.  ISO 1600 on the Sony is better than ISO 100 on the FZ200. [...]  In other words the FZ200 at base ISO 100 is like shooting at ISO 1600 with a real camera so don't even think about raising the ISO. Shame on Panasonic for allowing this to happen.

The worst thing about the manual is that there is no glossary or index at the end so you have to try to guess where a topic is covered.  I would not recomend this camera to anyone who is a beginner (too expensive for a simple point and shoot on auto) or someone who does not plan to take some time to get familiar with the camera.  If it were not for the poorly written manual, I would give this camera five stars.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Good Camera for the Novice", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RC891ZIKDRHD6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have an older Canon which is amazing but is only a 5MB.

Manual focus seems to be just a button that you push to do what AF should be doing.Needless to say I quickly returned the camera.If you already have an older DSLR without video like me, you will be disappointed by the image quality of this one.

Sifre", "ReviewID": "R1VQX3X90KXO6E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a casual photographer, who for the past several years has shot with a Nikon D300 that I purchased primarily for underwater photography. However, my Nikon gets a lot more use above-water now that diving has taken a back seat to raising our son. :)Obviously, you can't compare the two cameras. Nevertheless, I can't HELP but do so...1) I found it annoying to look through a viewfinder only to see a \"miniature\" LCD rendition.  \"EVF\" or \"Electronic Viewfinder\" may be handy to see how settings will impact the picture (I assume it did this but can't recall now), but I found it more of a step down from the D-SLR viewfinder.  I think I don't like having the light from the EFV shining in my eye, plus it feels like I am watching t.v. when I am taking a picture.2) I did not find the focus to be that great, indoors.  I do a lot of picture taking indoors and I had hoped that the low light abilities of this camera/lens would not disappoint. But, it disappointed me.  I found that putting it in Auto or Ai mode didn't really let me take decent pictures in ordinary room lighting.  Perhaps if I upped the ISO manually it would have been fine, but I bought the camera primarily for my wife, and I was hoping for a point and shoot experience with a terrific zoom lens that would let her take shots that werent blurry when she was in the house, without having to use the flash.3) I probably expected way too much -- and with the pop-up flash, I didn't have any complaints with the photo quality.  I just hate to shoot with a flash because I don't like people shooting flashes at me.4) I hated the fact that when you are \"in between\" shots, and just holding the camera, you risk having your fingers pinched quite badly when the camera goes to sleep and the lens retracts.  You really do have to be careful not to have the barrel of the lens in contact with your skin at all times, even when you aren't manipulating the lens yourself.5) I found that I missed not having a zoom ring.So, basically, I gave the camera very  little chance.  It did not impress me \"out of the box\" and it may be unfair to give the camera only 3 stars.  However, I thought it should be able to take more reliable indoor pictures without a flash and, generally speaking, I did not feel like I was getting sharp pictures, and I decided to try the Canon Ti4 instead.  I know it won't shoot like my Nikon, but the camera is for my wife, and I have a feeling that she will get much better pictures out of the DLSR then she could get out of the Lumix.Having given the camera very little chance, I can't really answer many questions about it. I did not try the software that came with it, I did not shoot any video with it.  I did very little flash photography with it, though perhaps most of my pictures ought to have used a flash.  I found it very difficult to acquire fast focus in low light and got lots of blurry pictures or missed picture taking opportunities, something that I just didn't expect and something I can't really tolerate after shooting with a different class of camera.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too soon to judge properly", "Author": "JORGE BROWN", "ReviewID": "R26XGLMPN8VJEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Too soon to make comments.

I was planning to purchase the Lumix DMC FZ200, until I learned nobody in my state sells this product.

Inability to locally ask a knowledgeable person(a person who repairs cameras, a person at an outstanding camera store)  about the product raises questions as well.I  owned a Panasonic Lumix zs8, which gathered so much dust in the lense, beyond the sensors, that the camera could not be used, packing/shipping costs eliminated possible repair as the camera was 2 years old... the fz200 might be a dust magnet too and inability to have the product cleaned locally is a concern that has caused me to consider another brand camera as a wiser choice.I am disappointed. It took days of research to decide which camera would replace the zs8.  Liking the zs8  influenced a preference for the fz200 over other brand cameras.
