I was low on money and thought it would do a great job. It did except for one thing. I didn't want to burn up the batteries so fast so I did not use the LCD. I trusted the Optical wievfinder and when I got the pictures downloaded, they were all shifted to the left and to the top by 1/4th of the frame. I upgraded to the 315 for $100 more and have been happy ever sence. With this camera, you can totally trust the viewfinder and know that \"What you see, is what you get!\" I can take up to 400 pictures in the \"Fine\" mode with Enegizer Titanium batteries. This is, of coarse, without using the LCD. Pictures are crystal clear and you can go as close as 10\" for close-ups. I use 64mb of compact flash and get up to 173 pictures in fine mode. If you take lots of pictures, this will be plenty of memory unless you go to Las Vegas and try to shoot everything there is! This Camera is the Best for the price. Very Easy to use.

I took 35 pictures and emailed them to the school website and all the alums could download the photos they wanted. I had also purchased a 48mb flashcard, so I have been able to take 60 photos at the sharpest setting. I had heard about these cameras eating batteries, but I have taken well over 200 pictures, reviewed, downloaded, and erased with the same batteries that came with the camera. The battery indicator is still registering full battery capacity.  I use the optical view finder to actually take the pictures. Photo quality is excellent and the software that accompanies the camera is also user friendly. You just plug the camera into either a serial or USB port and follow the easy steps to view or download the camera. After shopping the internet for the best features and prices of digital cameras and borrowing cameras from friends, I am really impressed with this camera. The only thing that keeps me from giving it the highest rating is that it doesn't have optical zoom, however, it does have digital zoom.

My first digital camera mind you, and I am sure there are features and functioons I have not used and that I am not qualified to critique.  The camera is simple to use, a battery hog if you are foolish enough to use the LCD screen on batteries,  but performs well on low resolution, storing 70 to 80 clear  pictures on an 8mb card.  The viewfinder is not as accurate as a regular SLR camera, they assume you'll use the LCD screen. So the aim is a bit right of center and bottom heavy.  After 800 photos I am impressed however.  Here's the rub. The retailers are not allowed by HP to stock the 6 volt AC adapter because HP  wants the buyer to come to their shopping site. Not only is it the worst website we've ever encountered, they haven't even manufactured the bloody adapter yet.  The week the camera came out, they were \"out of stock.\"  And rude help on the other end, amazing that they stay in the running. If I was the CEO, I'd bring out the big AXE.  But that is besides the point.  If you want to use rechargeables and get a large memory card, buy this camera.  If you are trying to power it up for a studio setting, for online auctions, etc, beware.

I've used a few other cameras (borrowed from friends) so I at least have a frame of reference.  Let me just say that for the price and what this camera has on it, it's a great deal.  Granted, it doens't have optical zoom, but if it did, I'd be paying another $60 to $100 along with maybe one or two other features.  It takes very good pictures.  It's very easy to use/understand.  Took me no time at all to take it out of the box, flip through the instructions, and start taking and downloading pictures to my PC.  There isn't one feature that's confusing to use.  I think this is the perfect 'first' digital camera for anyone.  If you're experienced and want all the bell's and whistles, don't buy this camera.

This is a perfect companion for those are new to digital imaging. Don't use the lowest quality (640x480) - not good for printing.

Get at least 64MB or 128MB + rechargeable battery.Pros 1: Don't need to install the software. Just plug-in the USB cable, and windows will take it as a removable drive. Very user friendly. The OS of the camera also very easy. My grandma will be able to use it without reading the manual. Pros 2: Not battery eater. I won't say it's the best, but I am quite satisfied. 80 pics taken with LCD on and transfer all of them with the same battery. Not to mention sometimes reviewing the pics taken. Pros 3: In almost totally dark condition, with highest setting, produce a decent quality.Cons 1: For Win2K users only: all HP digicam won't support CF higher than 32MB for direct transfer. You need to get a CF Reader. I have 128MB Viking and I need a CF Reader to download all the pics. No problem with other windows. Cons 2: Don't use the digital zoom. It's horrible.

Watson", "ReviewID": "R3LI41G2WVMXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, I've seen some reviews putting down the quality of this camera. My only guess is that they haven't dealt with digital cameras before. This camera takes great pictures, especially when considering the $300 price tag (I found a code on the internet and got it for $260, shipped free). What it sounds like people (giving poor reviews) are doing is keeping the pictures in the large 1600x1200 format. What you need to do in order to make the pictures  more crisp and clean is resize the picture to 1024x or 1280x pixels. This puts out fine pictures. Yes, it lowers the size of the picture, but these resolutions are still larger than most people's desktops. I use a free program Infranview which is downloadable off the net. It will resize pictures very easily.Will the pictures be as good as regular film. No. But the pictures are very good for a digital camera at this price. I spent a good amount of time doing research for a digital cam and decided on this one.The cam is fairly sturdy and has fine battery life (On 2 AA's I've taken roughly 25 pics using the LCD, and 140 w/o the LCD). The USB connection is fast. I would suggest this camera for anyone without a lot of cash to put into a dig cam but still wants fine pictures. Great for auctioneers.

I'd considered the Olympus, but ruled it out on features. I then settled on the Fuji, which was out of stock. Being in a hurry, I switched to this one and have been very happy with the choice.Being a Mac person, my choices were limited to begin with, but I made the right one here... even if it was by default. Not only does this camera give crisp images, but it also mounts to my desktop as an external USB hard drive for click-and-drag simplicity.FYI- When not using the LCD monitor as a viewfinder, the batteries will last quite a bit longer. Also, the Super Fine mode cuts the number of pictures you can take in half with negligible quality difference between the Fine mode.

Before using it, I had seldom produced a picture I would call remarkable, so the low cost of the camera was attractive. Thanks to the high storage capacity and reusability of Compact Flash cards, I have been able to capture hundreds and hundreds of images at a very low cost, and throw away the bad ones. Slowly but surely, I am becoming a better photographer, an accomplishment I never would have achieved at the high cost of film and film processing. I carry the HP 315 everywhere. I send digital pictures as email attachments to family and friends each week, and soon I'll burn CD photo albums as holiday gifts. This camera is perfect for me. With two 256MB Compact Flash cards in my pocket, I can travel and snap pictures for weeks without ever having to offload the images onto my Mac. In my opinion, the digital camera is to photography what word processing is to computing, a tool that enables everyone to create something useful, maybe even something extraordinary. Don't hestitate.

Medium/low res. are good for e-mail, high/medium res. are good for printing. -I got a 64meg memory card for it, (by Sandisk) low-649 med-162, and high-81 pictures.(Maybe i bought too big. :) ) But larger flash cards take a bit longer for the camera to recognize: when you turn on the camera there is a couple of seconds you have to wait before you can shoot. The 8-meg card took 2-3 seconds the 64-neg card takes 5-6 seconds before you can shoot.-Transfering to computer is easy, (i'm on a mac) USB connection took about 1-2 minutes to transfer a full 8 megs. -Only cons for this camera are the battery life, because unless you have a couple of sets of rechargable batteries(I have three sets) or the more expensive NIMH? batteries, (which I have heard good things about), you will not be able to use the LCD screen when shooting your pictures, as this eats up the batteries. Which is a shame, because the digital zoom is rendered hard to use, as you need the LCD to choose it via the menu. And well I assumed the LCD was a standard function which HP should have thought of when making this camera. (Digital zoom of course is just an internal magnification/cropping of the image and not a true zoom like \"optical\" zoom) With the LCD off however i can go 3-4 days with one set of batteries. (4AA's)I am very happy with the camera though, the picture quality is excellent, a bit dark on most indoor shots. I use it for shots of friends, parties, sketching for work, sending via e-mail, etc. If you are looking for an excellent entry level digital camera this is a very good choice, despite the battery life.

The USB download capability and camera recognition software has always worked flawlessly for me, and with a program such as PhotoSuite or PictureIt, you can really get great results with a decent quality inkjet printer.  The prints also look great on webpages where resolution can be lowered.For the serious buyer, I should point out a few shortcomings.  First, the batteries do tend to drain quickly, but this is lessened by using the lcd screen only when needed and keeping the camera off unless ready to shoot.  Also, the zoom is a bit awkward to use unless you have a stationary object that you are aiming at.  In addition, the lcd screen is not very well-lit and may not be visible at all in medium to low-light situations.

A SD card is a MUST, internal storage can only take 11 \"large\" photos (camera can take super small, medium, and large photos, but I imagine you'll only want large ones. Press the button with three diamonds under it to change the photo size, when I was first using this camera it was extremely disappointing to randomly get tiny photos and not know why, I later figured it out).", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "S.

It was a great upgrade from our sub-megapixel camera that had just broken.  I can't even remember the size of the card that came with it but upgraded to a 1GB Flash card.  The amount of 2MP pics you can take are endless.  The printer stunk and I gave it away as soon as the ink cartridges ran out, but the camera stayed and I still have it today.Heres the meat, pros and cons:Pros:-It takes excellent pictures.  The pictures we were taking from Hawaii actually spawned an HP digital camera revolution amongst my family.  They went out and bought a few High Quality HP cameras (much better than this one).-It can take a lickin' and keeps on....working.  I've dropped it, my wife has dropped, my daughter has dropped it; the batteries will pop out, but we stick them back in and it works.  Dropping it on concrete gave the thing a few scuffs though.-Ease of use.  Turn it on, and it's a no brainer.  You don't need a stinkin' manual for this one.-It has a viewfinder.  Nice feature to have when it's sunny or you're trying to preserve battery power.Cons:-Bulky.  It's bigger than my 60GB camcorder.  It wasn't \"cute\" enough for my wife so I had to by her a Coolpix.-Battery.  It takes sooooo many batteries - 4 AAs.  That's a bunch.  And it goes through them quicker than a alcoholic through a 6-pack of Bud.Hawaii was sunny, which meant that we couldn't see the lcd display most of the time.  We used the view finder A LOT.-Charge time to next picture.  Yes, it's slow.  Missed a lot of shots waiting for the thing to get ready for the next available picture op.Tips:I've never had an issue taking an action shot.  I found that if I depressed the shoot button half way to initiate the focus and simply followed what ever it was that was moving, then depressed the button all the way for the instant shot, it would always take a clear shot.  This trick seems to work on many digital cameras that have issues with action shots.Overall:There's way better cameras out there now.  This was over 5 years ago.  Technology has advanced far enough now that you can afford a camera much cheaper than this with better quality and a higher mega pixel shot.  But at that time, it was a great addition to our family and is still occasionally used to this day (when I scrape up a handful of AA batteries).", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Blurry pictures", "Author": "Angie", "ReviewID": "R10YGTTX2KI0N8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about five years and thought the poor photos were me.

It's very easy to use, and the pictures are decent at max res.

The lack of compatibility with XP has already been addressed by other reviewers, but I would recommend getting a flash reader regardless.If you have experience with digital photography, or want professional quality photo's, think about spending another [money].

If you aren't the type that usually uses the camera in the most basic way possible, this is a good camera for you.  If you expect a lot out of your camera, look elsewhere.Pros:- VERY easy to use.  Easy to move pictures from the camera to the computer (you do not need any special s/w, it shows up just like an external hard drive.)- Great price for the image quality.  This gives you good bang for your buck.- Good battery life.  I took 160 pictures with 1 set of batteries, and still had a little juice left.Cons:- Zoom is useless... it's very grainy.  There are other products available that you can attach to this camera to do zooming.- LCD is useless at night, or in a dark room.- Default memory card is not big enough.  10 pictures is just not enough.  If you get this camera, buy a bigger memory card.

I took it back the next day.  This was my first digital camera and I was really disappointed in what I saw in the pictures.  They were grainy and lacked detail.  I suppose if I looked more closely at the camera, I would have noticed the 1/8 inch diameter lens and that might have clued me in that there would be a difference.  I was just looking for something to take pictures to send in e-mails and this did not do the job.  The pictures taken inside were dark.  I expect that if I only used this camera outside on sunny days it might work better.  I also found it very hard to hold.  Because all the controls are on the side that you hold the camera, the camera seemed unbalanced and was easily dropped.  The wrist strap is a must.  ... is the most that I have ever paid for a camera, and I guess I expected more.  I can see from the general pricing of the digital cameras that this is on the low end.  Since I was not after something that would be used for printing pictures, I had assumed, from all the favorable reviews, that this camera would work.  I was mistaken.  I am not sure I place much trust in  reviews, without some actual photos to back them up.  The software to import the pictures into the computer worked very well and was fast through the USB port.

Even printing on plain paper with an HP color inkjet printer does pretty well.  Has 3 picture quality settings and for these purposes it's not worth going to the highest.  The middle setting does just fine.The drawbacks - don't be fooled.  The digital zoom works fine, but is no subsititute for a true optical zoom.  But then you'd pay another ...  for the optical so you get what you pay for. It does use batteries rather quickly (I use the display for my picture taking all the time so they do tend to go a bit quicker). And trying to catch 'action' shots can be a bit tricky since there is a half second or so delay between pressing the button and when the picture actually takes.

Not having an optical zoom feature like other cameras, it is very difficult to zoom in on your subjects unless you walk up to them and stand just a couple of feet from them.In addition, under low light situations, the LED viewer is not able to show the images you are trying to take photos of.  You are restricted to using the view finder to find what you are trying to take a photo of.  I found out about this limited feature while attending a wedding reception.  I was not able to see what I was trying to take a photo of unless I used the view finder and as a result, many of my photos show the bride and groom very far off in the actual photo.The camera takes wonderful photos outdoors and in limited flash photo situations so it is a great camera for those types of photos.

The batteries remain at full power and I haven't had to change them since I bought the camera. I don't use an AC adaptor either, so that is promising.

I suppose if one wanted to they could get away with just pressing various buttons until they got to the menu item they wanted. You can simply link the camera up to a USB port and not bother with installing software.The quality of picture, however, was rather fuzzy.
