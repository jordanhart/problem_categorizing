If you're looking at this camera then you've probably already done tons of research, so I'll just leave bullet points.  I've only had this for 4 days, but have spent about 35 hours with it by now and feel like I know it pretty well!Pros -- It's TINY.  I was expecting it to be bigger, but it's barely bigger than the X-E1/X-E2.- Fits in the hand beautifully.  Fuji have put a rubber \"nub\" on the rear top right corner, and it's perfect for one-handed shooting.- The knobs on top are great, everything is intuitive. I actually bought the Nikon Df in December and returned it after a couple of weeks, it never became intuitive.  The only thing I would change is not having to press the button in when changing ISO every time.- Rear screen is big and bright.  Seen many comments saying it should be a touchscreen (it shouldn't) and it should flip sideways (it shouldn't) - touchscreens should stay far, far away from cameras!- Build quality is ace.  Feels rock solid, but weighs practically nothing.- SD card slot is on the side, helps with not having to take off tripod to change card.- OHMYGOODNESS THE EVF!  I've never been a fan of EVFs, but this is incredible.  The first day I shot with it, I loved it, but I knew I needed to wait until shooting at night until I got the full picture - it was fantastic.  Helped me see things in the dark that I never would with an OVF, it's going to change the way I shoot night photography.  Being able to see exposure and WB changes in the viewfinder before shooting is fantastic - and the auto-rotation when shooting vertical is genius.Cons -- the buttons are just a tiny bit TOO indented on the rear of the camera.  I'm sure there's a reason for this - weather-proofing maybe, or maybe during testing having looser buttons resulted in too high an occurrence of accidental button pushes, I don't know - but they're a little too indented for me.- battery life, but if they'd have used a bigger battery they'd have had a bigger camera.- no 2nd memory card slot, but same as above - would have resulted in a bigger camera.That's it.  I absolutely love it.  I've got a couple of Nikon D800s (always been a Nikon guy), a Mamiya RZ67ProII, a Rollei - but I'll shoot more frames with this camera than I will with almost all of them combined this year.  Fuji is doing incredible things - if they can add to their speedlight options they're going to have the perfect setup.And seriously, this price is phenomenal for the camera.  You won't regret it!  (But get the body only - the kit lens is really good, but the primes are breathtakingly good.)", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Small Camera that Has and Does it ALL", "Author": "L. Rothman", "ReviewID": "R1VWMKU4UDI2VB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had many a pro DSLR camera body and lenses as well as a complete Micro 4/3rd system over the last 5 years (EM1 Olympus) I fully understand the compromises that can come from a \"non\" DSLR system. Slower focus, lessor color depth, slower shooting ability, poorer build quality, and the list goes onNow having said that I sold ALL my camera gear off in the anticipation of this camera and lens system. I researched till I could no longer find a competent review and photo taken with this amazing X-Trans sensor. After a week of ownership I can say without hesitation THIS is the camera that will set some benchmarks after time. The Sony A7's get their accolades, but the Fuji's present something \"different\" intrinsic to the photographic picture. A nearly 3D look to their files that can hardly be explained. Their colors are simply yummy and are so pleasant to see. The files are also virtually devoid of ANY sensor noise or artifacts. Sony has noise reduction built in and compression you can NOT turn off. The Micro 4/3rd bodies unfortunately possess noise at ALL ISO sensitivities. This camera I can shoot right up to ISO6400 and see nearly NOTHING noise oriented 100% on screen. There is NO noise or artifacts in the blue sky shots.Moving along to the other aspects that are amazing. This camera is fully capable of 8fps while focusing continuously. And frankly having owned a venerable D700 full frame Nikon, this camera will keep right up with it in the tracking arena. Even just spur of the moment mashing of the shutter button will render you an IN focus shot, so being spontaneous is rewarded. The build is rock solid and the switches are very tight and are not likely to be mistakenly moved. Even the back \"D\" pad of 4 buttons won't work by accident, you have to purposely push them. No surprises in that area with this camera. It even comes with a competent fill flash you can snap onto the hot shoe. Surprisingly it is quite powerful and will provide plenty of flash power for an average room.Now to the LCD and the Viewfinder, which is a HUGE (largest view on the market) OLED with rich brightness and color, suitable for eyeglass and non eyeglass wearers alike. It is configurable so as to see a 100% view across from one side to the other, looking more like an IMAX theater than a standard movie screen. It has a unique split screen mode for manual focus providing a 100% view on the right and showing where in the shot it is showing in that box, allowing for pinpoint precision manual focusing. I've found the battery life to be quite surprising. I charged up on Thursday and now its Monday and I'm still shooting. It is highly configurable in general to one's specific needs with many custom function buttons you can set to what you want. ALL of the Fuji lenses are like top line quality found in the Canon L or Nikkor pro series at half the price in some cases. Sharp corner to corner with large apertures available. I use the kit 18-55 but don't be fooled, this is a \"PRO\" lens all the way in build and performance. I also recommend the 23mm f1.4 for outdoor and indoor walk around shooting with great subject isolation capabilites. Lastly one of my favorites and a Must Have. The 55-200. Built like a tank, still lightweight and solid and super sharp and fast to focus. This system is a amazing photographic tool. Don't miss out on not having it.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simple and Advanced? The camera that molds itself to YOUR style of shooting.", "Author": "Chris R. Field \"christoph281\"", "ReviewID": "RSN6XJ8ZEYS2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wont bother with image quality, it is the same as the XE-2, basically the same as the Xpro-1. This is a hit or miss with some people, i wont waste any time as this is not what makes this camera unique in Fuji's lineup.  Read any Fuji X-trans review for image quality. All I will say is it is top notch.I have been shooting with the XE-1 and OMD EM-5 for the last year or so. I primarily do timelapse photography which is comparable to landscape photography, also studio plant timelapse and macro work.  General photography is a hobby of mine. I am not a professional photographer but do use photography professionally, if that makes sense. I moved from Nikon pro gear to mirrorless cameras to save weight for extended hikes to remote areas.the XT-1 is about as perfect as a camera (for my purposes) as i have ever found, it certainly sets a new bench mark.I doubt I will be using my XE-1 much at all for general photography. I have had this love hate relationship between the OMD and the XE-1. I liked the output of the XE-1, but found the AF to be terrible, the EVF was decent, but nothing to scream about. Everything the XE-1 did poorly the OMD excelled at, everything the OMD fell short in the XE-1 excelled in.The XT-1 is so much faster in operation than the XE-1. the AF is very fast, it seems to be very accurate. Compared to any other mirrorless camera on the market the AF-C  tracks like a bloodhound. Which to say it is about as good as a prosumer level DSLR.  The viewfinder is not only usable, it is darn good. I think the XT-1's EVF is probably the first one that really starts to threaten the OVF. Looking through this one, I would suspect the EVF is only 2 maybe 3 small generations to outperforming an OVF in every way imaginable. Not quite there yet, but that gap between the XE-1 EVF and a solid 100% view pentaprism OVF just got a lot smaller. And dont worry, the EVF future is looking incredible! There is NO percieveable lag in the viewfinder, I would suspect the lag is insignificant compared to the average persons response time. meaning, you wont lose the shot due to lag, even in low light scenarios.For the build quality, i would say using a DSLR comparison it would be like a D800 vs a D7x00 series. Or a 5Dmk3 vs a 60D. Where you pick it up and are somehow immediately able to recognize it as something that is very well crafted and designed, and that it is a thing if quality. The knobs feel fantastic, the textured faux leather is far nicer than the XE-1's, it feels like it was machined out of a solid piece. Even the LCD screen feels solid and confidant. That is how the XT-1 not only feels compared to the XE-1, but it also looks that way too. I'm not 100% how to describe it, but I'm sure everyone understands exactly what I am talking about. This is a serious camera, I have owned and enjoyed the Fuji XE-1, first gen Olympus Pen, Olympus OMD, Sony NEX-3, Sony NEX-5N, and Nikon J1, I have handled the NEX6, and NEX7. I liked all those cameras, they all had thier strengths and weaknesses, however this is the first mirrorless camera I have ever held that feels like a professional grade tool. It looks great in the pictures, it looks and feels amazing in your hand. I would be wary of the opinion of anybody who says this is anything but a solidly constructed tool.well, except for the side door which feel as cheap as ever. and the unlock buttons on the dials are\"ok\". And of course, the rear buttons sure are flush. so its not all puppies and sunshine, but those seem awfully insignificant in the long run (to me at least).The flash they give in, well, i havent used it yet, and i probably wont. But it feels nicer than the clip on flash that came with the NEX3, NEX5, and OMD, which all felt like junk to me.(I have not used or tested the SONY A7(r) or A6000, Olympus OMD EM-1. Sony and Olympus both make fantastic gear, i love all brands, my raving about the XT-1 should not be viewed as an attack on these fantastic cameras, to be honest though, I have yet to hold a mirrorless camera from ANY brand that feels as good as this)This is NOT a light camera. For some reason everyone seems way too zoned in on the fact a camera CAN be smaller when mirrorless, and yes, it can, but I would think the larger benefit is the ability to go with smaller lens elements, reducing the cost for high quality lenses. I mean come on, we are all adults here, garbage in, garbage out. That is what lured me into the Fuji system is the excellent optics, the 35 1.4 is every bit as sharp as the Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 which i owned for years, but costs a fraction of the price (different lens different purposes i know, but the idea remains the same). I cant say enough about the Fuji lenses that i have used. Currently my lineup includes the 18-55 (best kit lens ever made period) the 35mm f/1.4, and the 14mm f/2.8. All three of these lenses have strong reputations for a very good reason.Im handling mine right now with the 14 f/2.8 and i tell ya what, I cant imagine this was any lighter than my D7000 and the 35mm 1.4 lens. This is NOT a pocketable camera. Even with a pancake lens, unless you have comically large pants with giant pockets full of ipads and animals.As for customization, that can all be found online as well. You can customize the crap out of this camera. The manual focus assist options are fantastic, the response time is near instant, the back LCD looks fantastic, and the Wifi works like a champ. Where as the first Fujis were a bit limited in options and gimmicks, this thing has the whole catalog and more. And the best part is if you dont like that junk, and just want to use it as a manual camera, well, go ahead. None of that stuff gets in the way. This camera can be as basic, or as advanced as YOU wish. It is a camera that easily molds itself to your style of shooting.As for the XE-1, it will probably be kept as a backup camera, but live most of its life on one of my motion controlled time lapse rigs with my OMD. I just got the parts to build out a battery adapter so i can run it with large capacity batteries for extended timelapse in the field, or plug it into the wall if needed.This is hands down the best mirrorless camera i have ever held. (as mentioned before, i have NOT used the Sony A7(r), A6000 or the new OMD Em-1 all of which seem to draw most comparisons)", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "From an XPro-1 user...I caved!", "Author": "MS", "ReviewID": "R2VCCNU9R0HL9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I caved and bought the X-T1 but I'm sure glad I did. I've been a big fan of the Xpro since its release and I ended up selling all of my Canon gear because of it. Although the focus was lacking slightly I found the other features (image quality, body size, lens quality, etc) to far outweigh any concerns I had about it. For my style of shooting, mostly street, the focusing was more than adequate. Although I used the electronic viewfinder more and more, I still appreciated having the optical viewfinder for certain situations and I didn't think I would purchase the X-T1 because of this. I also really like the rangefinder style of the xpro and wasn't initially a fan of the new SLR-like design.Well I don't know what happened, a moment of weakness, some vague nebulous logic I used about having had the Xpro for two years, not expecting another Xpro upgrade for some time, and all the great reviews of the X-T1, and click! it was done and on its way.I have to say that all the gushing over the X-T1 is warranted. The focus speed is orders of magnitude faster, even using the older lenses such as the 35mm f1.4 and 28mm f2. It really adds to the enjoyment and of using the camera. The electronic viewfinder is a joy to use and there are times I forget I am not looking through an optical finder, it's that good. The flip out LCD is really a nice addition, something I had never really appreciated before for street photography, both to achieve certain angles and for some discreet shots. The camera is overall much more responsive too. The customization options are a plus. The camera body is fairly small but robust and looks like it could take a punch. The manual focus options are really great; one can use a centered 'rangefinder' type patch, focus peaking (with different intensities and colors available) or the very cool side-by-side view with the second image being the magnified area of focus.Overall it feels like a big upgrade from the X-pro 1 and I'm happy I bought it. There is a lot more to this camera that I won't use like wi-fi or the ability to perform interval shooting but it is a noticeable leap in technology for me coming from the older camera.The bad? Not much. You've heard the controls on the back are a little bit too recessed, that's probably true but for me it's a matter of becoming accustomed to it rather than hating it. Having used dozens of cameras over the years, one always has to get used to some quirk of every piece of gear. I'm just so enthralled about having such amazing technology available to me these days that these small things don't bother me. Also I've noticed that the heavier lenses such as the 23mm f1.4 on this smaller body make for a slightly less ergonomic feel. Again, small bother. I went ahead and ordered the non-battery grip to see if this helps a bit.Finally, since I made the jump into a new camera body, I ordered the kit 18-55 lens as well. I'm not a zoom lens user but since I have a family with small kids, zooms are convenient at times so I thought I'd take advantage of the package deal. The lens has really amazing image quality and focuses extremely fast and quietly. It's a step up in build quality from Fuji's earlier lenses like the 35 f1.4. The zoom is well-balanced on the X-T1 body. I find owning this lens frustrating because I try to carry very little gear when out and only use primes but that zoom lens keeps finding a place in my bag. It's that good.Five stars without hesitation.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Short Simple Review", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R17CSBMYDHDP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally looking for an everyday camera to carry with me so I got the X-Pro1.

How can this be? Read on. . .Over the past seven years, I've owned over 20 different DSLRs (mostly Nikon) and mirrorless cameras, including the D800 and D3s, as well as a slew of professional lenses. I've used Fuji's X system since the day the X-Pro1 came out, and have the x100s as well.The X-T1 is the best of all of these, and it's not particularly close. Why? Four reasons:1) You can chimp without chimping. Although technically possible with any EVF camera, the X-T1's 'OMG I just walked into a movie theatre' viewfinder experience makes it the first camera where I PREFER reviewing images in the viewfinder rather than the LCD. This extends into other chimp-esque tasks, such as checking focus with the genius split screen system, or playing around in the menus. The bottom line is, with this camera you won't have to look like a tool staring down at the LCD between shots, and can instead keep your eye in the viewfinder like a mack daddy.2) It beams pictures to your phone. So you can, you know, actually DO something with them while they're timely and relevant. The #1 competitor for any standalone camera in the economy of your life is your smartphone. Now they can work together! I know there are other cameras that have wi-fi as a feature but I haven't used any. What I can say is that it works FLAWLESSLY on this thing. Tap, tap, tap, BOOM - the photo is on your phone. It's even smart enough to load the most recent pictures first for you in the bowser.3) It's just...so...FAST. Not just the insane 8 frames per second, I'm talking everything. The start-up time. The (essentially nonexistent) shutter lag. The AF speed, especially on the newer XF series lenses. The card-write time. The image snapping up in the EVF or LCD for you to review. It's the first X-system camera to feel as fast or faster-than a DSLR.4) The fit and finish. What am I talking about? The weight. The feel. The number and placement of the buttons. The shape of the grips. The resistance of the dials. The LOOKS. It's about a 93 out of 100 here, with the only deduction being for the multi-selector. Not only is the multi-selector a little mushy, the buttons are recessed for some reason so they're kind of hard to press. Still, a 93% in this category is better than just about every other camera out there,Put all of this together, as well as the expected but nonetheless impeccable image quality, and I've never had a camera I've liked so much, so quickly. You will too.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best ILC to date but with some important flaws.", "Author": "Samsuddha", "ReviewID": "RZDXME95CVSP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My precise score would've been 4.5/ 5.  On whole, the Fuji X-T1 is one heck of a camera - probably the best mirrorless camera to date. But by no means is it the perfect camera.  The thing with the camera is - some of its features redefine awesomeness; whereas some oversights and choices are just...dumb. That is why, despite the fact that this is probably one of the best cameras ever, I cannot rate it at 5 stars..If you don't want to read through the detailed review below: here's the nutshell:Absolutely superb camera with more technical innovation  in one small body than entire systems put together.  Simply outstanding picture quality (especially with excellent Fuji X lenses); best EVF ever, great build quality and handling (except the 4 way button; the SD card door which others have pointed out doesn't bother me - it'll hold) and generally excellent ergonomics (except minor gripes about using the ISO control wheel).  As I said before, I think this is, on the whole, the best mirrorless camera as of date, and to be fair, at an excellent price point.  However, the perfect score is missed due to some really daft issues - such as a difficult to use 4-way control; lack to direct access to AF point selection; difficult to use ISO wheel and lack of ISO 100 in RAW mode.While the above cons are real and unfortunate, they are not enough to detract from the general awesomeness of the camera; and coupled with the fact that the system itself has some of the best lens choices at attractive price points - obviously a highly recommended product and one I will be keeping for sure. I did not have any light leak issue on my piece, I checked.Pros:1. Viewfinder: Obviously the most obvious attraction of the camera.  large and sumptuous.  Very user friendly in providing useful information like histogram etc. and the information overlay nicely adjusts for portrait shooting. Also, there is absolutely no viewfinder lag whatsoever on account of the very high refresh rates.2. Dual view mode on EVF and LCD: very useful for quick manual focusing.  Allows you to check composition and precision of focus at the same time.3. Picture quality:  I think Fuji X sensors combined with Fuji X lenses provide the best IQ short of high end full frame.  In my non-technical comparisons - IQ seemed as good as my D600 with high end Nikon lenses.  The colors have a special look to them though the LR color profiles (introduced in LR 5.4) don't do justice to them if you are shooting RAW.  I save the capture in both RAW and jpeg, and sometimes the JPEGs are good enough without any further processing. If the camera could output 16bit tiff files (fairly, most cameras don't because of space/memory considerations) it'd have been best of both worlds!4. Continuous AF: very high accuracy on my own test shots and professional reviewers seem to have this opinion also.  Finally, a Fuji X camera with proper AF tracking5. Single point AF: Very fast compared to my previous experience with mirrorless on the whole, and Fuji in particular.6. Hardly any shutter lag noticed.  I found this is a bit of a problem with mirrorless cameras in the past (including with my much loved x100s)7. Manual focus assists: The focus peaking especially works really well; though the rangefinder  B&W; split screen was less useful than I hoped (since the patch tends to get quite noisy affecting visibility)8. Dials, dials and dials: The more the merrier of course - and Fuji X-T1 has more than any camera I can recall (including old film ones).  What's not to like??? (except setting Auto ISO probably - and some slight issues of ergonomics in using the ISO dial with the eye to the VF; and the fact that the Exposure Comp. dial can moved around in the bag - see cons)9. Adjustable Fn buttons:  Almost all the buttons (though not the dials) can be adjusted and changed by the user.  That's great for customizing the camera to suit your style of shooting.10.  2 extra Fn keys:  Useful for setting functions you access often - I use one for changing Auto ISO settings (upon changing lenses); and the other one for selecting Macro mode [this allows lenses (even non-macro lenses) to focus faster in close distances]11. The Fuji X system: The importance of looking at the system as a whole cannot be over-stated. The Fuji X system is a really attractive one right now with great prime and zoom lenses that are available - especially the recently released 14mm f2.8, 23mm f1.4; the 10-24 f4 OIS and my new favorite - the 56mm f1.2. I also think the prices for the lenses are about right.  If you think they are expensive - compare them Canon and Nikon offerings of similar performance and you will be surprised.  The IQ of the RAW files depends on both the sensor and the lenses and the Fuji X system shines on both fronts.12. Takes UHS-II SD cards - will be great for burst shooting13. wifi implementation: Largely successful. I had no problems connecting my camera to my smartphone; copying pictures or remotely controlling the camera14. Build quality and handling: Truly well built - very compact and ergonomic - provides an easy grip and feels natural.  I've not had occasion to use the camera in bad weather yet (just some light rain in my last shoot) but the weatherproofing is a potentially useful feature for travel and nature photographers, what with the weather-sealed lenses being also announced.15. Using legacy lenses is a breeze with the large EVF and focus assist methods.16,17 and 18:  Looks looks and looks!!!Cons:Major1. Horrible 4 way Control dial: Why why why? very difficult to use - it is so depressed into the camera body that I have to use my nails instead of fingertips (granted my fingers are thicker than average).  This is all the more disappointing after my experience with x100s - which I think has one of the best implemented 4-way control/control wheels!  I guess they had to save money somewhere to keep the price competitive but they chose the single most important camera controller.  The biggest issue in day to day shooting comes while trying to set the AF point (more on AF toggling below)2. AF Point setting: - Two big issues - one; you have to press one key to activate AF-point setting.  This is not expected of a pro or advanced amateur camera. Second, the AF-point selection is though the 4-way control which is (as mentioned above) is horrible.  Both together make the AF point setting a not-so pleasurable experience (though this does get a bit easier with use). For objects a bit further away or at smaller apertures it is probably easier on the whole to focus and recompose. One tip: the default button to activate AF selection is the down key in the 4 way controller.  I have reprogrammed it to the Fn button in front of the camera (this is where your middle finger will be when holding the camera normally), which seems to work better.3. Flash Sync speed of 1/180: Very low IMO (you will see no difference shooting at 1/200 though). Was a normal 1/250 too much to ask?? Olympus OMD cameras have a flash sync speed of 1/320 (almost a stop faster) When shooting in daylight, this extra half to 2/3 stop can be extremely useful.4. Lack of good wireless TTL options:  This is a problem with the system as a whole to be honest and not the camera - but you buy the camera, you buy into the system, so its a valid point.  Pro and advanced amateur shooters would like a good wireless TTL system to be supported by their camera for fast and dirty flash set ups such as required in location shoots, weddings etc.  Fuji does not offer this yet.  Rumors are something is in the works; in which case I really hope that the the X-T1 will be compatible as well when it does come.5. Min. and Max. ISO while shooting RAW is 200 and 6400,  and not 100 (offered in most cameras) and 12800 (offered in similar price-point cameras).  If you shoot at lower or higher ISO than this range, you get only JPEG outputs. The higher limit is not much an issue honestly since I hardly go over 3200.  However, not being able to shoot RAW at ISO 100 IS a problem.  This is because when shooting in bright sunlight at wide apertures; one needs the lowest ISO possible (also see gripe about max. shutter speed).  For example, in most cases, you wont be able to use the 56mm f1.2 at widest aperture in bright daylight.  One has to use an ND Filter, which is a pain.  This is all the more an important shortcoming, because of the max. shutter speed being 1/4000 instead of 1/8000 as offered in Ollie OMD-EM1 and many other competing cameras.Minor gripes:1. Max Shutter speed of 1/4000 (as compared to 1/8000 for Ollie and Panasonic flagships): wouldn't be an issue except for the minimum ISO issue pointed out above (especially since one needs wider apertures for the same depth of field effect in an APS-C size sensor as compared to FF).  But for that, 1/4000s is usually plenty good enough for uses and is not much of an issue .2. EVF/LCD can be a bit noisy - especially when using on MF mode (I think the camera raises the sharpness levels of the EVF/LCD in such a case).  I think in a trade-off between slower response time and noisier EVF/LCD; Fuji chose the latter. Cant really say its a bad choice in theory, but maybe they didn't get the sweet spot just right.  However, this is mainly a problem with third party lenses (because the lens closes down to the aperture you are actually using while composing itself, hence decreasing light gathered by the sensor and thereby increasing noise)3. Auto ISO: Would've been nice if the minimum shutter speed could be pegged to the lens' focal length (or 1.5 times thereof) since that is how many people would like to program it.  However, this feature is not common in most cameras yet.4. Dials: Ex.Comp. dial moves around too easily.  Sometimes quickly taken pictures (and these will usually be of quickly unfolding scenes which you cannot come back to) will get overexposed or underexposed because of the dial having been moved accidentally while dangling from your shoulder or in the bag.).  Contrarily, the ISO button (which requires a toggle to pressed before moving) is very difficult to turn while composing with the eye on the viewfinder. mainly because of having to keep the toggle pressed with one finger while turning with the others - and also because the dial is bit stiff). Given the small size of the camera; one risks poking one's left eye in the process.5. Q button/ Q menu: generally a nice feature for accessing key camera features - but it would be nice if the menu was customizable. Currently, most of the options in the Q menu are relevant only for JPEGS shooters and RAW shooters cannot get much purchase out of this menu.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Early buyer, late reviewer - but it's ideal", "Author": "Michael C.

I was an SLR purist.Cut to now - The DX format has excelled at offering several excellent bodies, but if you want anything good other than a super-zoom, you have to go third party, and if you want a prime, you have to select from the very, very small pool of DX primes, or live with FX primes, which are great if you don't mind the extra weight and never need a wide angle.I picked up an X-Pro on discount some time back, because Fuji had caught my attention with the return to intuitive selection of shutter speed / aperture, especially with the return of aperture rings to lenses.  I fell in love with the X-Pro, but it wasn't fast enough to replace my D7100, the EVF lagged, and the OVF wasn't as useful as I wished....  I still preferred how it handled, and the excellent lens quality of the 35mm F1.4 as well as the light 18mm F2, but it couldn't always keep up.  Firmware helped, but the EVF was still - well, irritating to use at times.The X-T1 took every complaint I had about the X-Pro, and fixed it - big time.  I thought I would miss the OVF, but I don't - I don't even think about it.  The EVF is THAT good.With the excellent collection of primes that Fuji has released, as well as the SURPRISINGLY excellent 18-55mm \"kit\" lens (that's nicer than any DX zoom offered, with the possible exception of the 17-55, but that's debatable), I've had no need for any of my Nikon gear - and the X-T1 is an absolute joy to use, in every way.  Focus is spot on and fast - Not always as lightning quick as some SLR lenses can be, but still faster than most.This and the 23mm F1.4 have become my go-to kit... That, the 14mm, and the 55-200 have become a travel kit of sorts - and I'll likely switch out to the 56mm instead of the zoom at some point.  The quality and versatility is unmatched at this size.At this point in the evolution of digital cameras, any reasonable camera will be sufficient - the camera generally isn't the limiting factor, the photographer is.  That being said, there is a lot of value in a camera that works the way you want it to, and doesn't get in your way.  The Fuji X-T1 excels at that.... and combined with the XF lenses with aperture rings, I feel VERY comfortable with the camera, and not so much like I'm fighting it.Will this do all of the 3-D focus tracking like the D7100 will?  Nope, it won't.  However, it has been much more consistent about actually hitting the focus points at high speeds - If I drop the X-T1 into CH mode, every frame will be tack sharp - where the focus selector is positioned, that is.  While some DSLRs may track better, I haven't seen the same degree of keepers...  but YMMV.  If you are a TRUE action-oriented shooter, and really nutty hard-to-track action, then likely the DSLR is still the right tool for you.  If you aren't really pushing that functionality to its limits, the X-T1 will likely keep up just as well.I use this for travel as well as more intentional photography.  I also use it in the studio with strobes.  I basically use this EVERYWHERE except for where I can't bring interchangeable lens cameras...  It has taken excellent photos in low-light concerts, it has excelled while hiking.  There is not anything I have found that this isn't an ideal camera -- for ME.  For you?  That depends...If you are looking to switch systems, take a good look at why and what you need.  There are still some gaps in the lineup (although not many) that may not meet your needs.Beware that the weather sealing is for the body only, there are only three lenses on the roadmap that are weather sealed.... and none of them are primes at the time of this writing.  If you shoot primes in the rain, well, an SLR may still be for you.  That's an edge case, though.If you are looking to grab a good body with a good kit zoom and nothing else, this will do the trick - but likely so will others, if you aren't as interested in how the camera operates.  If you don't want to control shutter speed, ISO, or aperture manually, then this is NOT the camera for you - It will do fine in all auto modes, don't think otherwise, but that WILL likely get in your way.I've been shooting with this since it was released, and literally have zero complaints about it.  This is a wonderful direction for digital cameras to go... and I suspect it will just keep getting better.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect hybrid of RETRO FEEL and FUTURE TECH", "Author": "Tim Kimzey \"fstop\"", "ReviewID": "R12CTEXCU7C8RL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In many ways I feel the FujiFilm X-T1 is a groundbreaking camera, though it is my first step into the \"Compact System Camera\" genre.I've shot with many film and digital cameras, professionally, for around 25 years. I currently shoot my day-job (working photojournalist) with a Nikon D4. After shooting film for many years and hand-processing it on a daily basis, I welcomed digital ;). In 2000, I was chosen by my company (a NYT-owned newspaper) to fly to another state and meet with a Nikon rep to learn how to use the new D1 that was about to come upon the scene. I've shot with many Nikon bodies since the D1 and own too much glass and flash equipment to even dream about switching to another system at the moment. I kind of laughed at the 4/3 systems when I heard about them, thinking them backwards-thinking when bigger sensors were becoming more mainstream, and getting cheaper and better. Then I saw and felt smitten by a Fuji X10, and a friend adopted an Olympus in favor of his pro Canon gear. I had such a huge system of camera equipment it was daunting, but I could use a new point/shoot, right? I love to hike and shoot nature, but wanted something small and light, but still capable. The X10 met my needs, and still does.Fuji seems to get what I like in a camera: not only the look but the ergonomics, features, the blending of old-style with the latest cutting-edge technology. Real buttons and dials that are tactile--you feel connected to the machine in your hand, letting it help you create your vision. No vast menus that become a plethora of a corn maze you cant find your way out of.Let me get one thing straight--I am not a \"fanboy\" of any system or brand. I began my photo career shooting with Minolta. I owned (3) Maxxum 9000 bodies (the first Pro AF body made) and shot daily news with them for nearly 10 years. Simultaneously, I used Nikon F3's and FM2's, switching between both systems for years (owned Maxxum 9xi and Nikon F5 before digital took over) But I've shot mostly with Nikon for the last 15 years, even while close friends and colleagues switched from Nikon to Canon in the 90's when their AF systems began whipping Nikon. Minolta never had as big a \"pro\" market as Nikon or Canon, but they were innovators. First mass-produced AF camera, first multi-segment metering system, wireless TTL flash. I believe the Minolta R&D; team still lives on in Sony, who is also doing innovative things as well...I've had to keep up with technology. I've had to switch from shooting only stills to video clips and editing/posting multimedia, web-based reportage. Modern DSLRs shoot quality video, but the bodies were not ever initially designed to shoot video technically, or ergonomically. I could never stand looking at the LCD to shoot, so I bought the first Hoodman loupe and made my own straps from hair bands to hold it onto my camera. Worked, but still a pain. No mic input, so you had to have audio recorders and mics seperately. Most people, probably those reading this, simply hate video and would wish it was not even a feature built into this camera. But the X-T1 does a few things I like in that regards. The video feature is for the most part hidden, the dedicated button on the top-plate is perfect. You simply shoot a video clip when you want to without having to put the camera into video mode (and then forget that you left it there when the moment happens for a great still picture). You press the dedicated button again to stop shooting video. It does have a microphone input, which is very important for video. I wish it was the standard 3.5mm jack, but my adapter works fine. It has on-screen audio metering and some limited manual audio control, but no headphone jack for monitoring. The video output is perfectly fine for home movies and web-based news clips.The camera IS COMPACT, more so than I had imagined. Certainly compared to the beast of a D4. My hands are not small, but my rather long and slender fingers can manipulate the controls just fine. The back menu buttons are very recessed and are hard to find by touch. But they would probably be in the way if they were bigger on this limited-real-estate body.To me, the camera just feels about perfect. That's something hard to really quantify and very personal so that's all I will say--as it may differ greatly for you. It fits well in a small canvas bag with just a couple of lenses (my goal) and should work well for travel and even pro shooting without the kitchen sink. I plan to get the upcoming 16-55mm f/2.8, and along with the 56mm f/1.2, shoot about 90% of what I need with two XF lenses.I have this lens adapter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D9BL07E/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) which is doing OK converting my many Nikkors to Fuji X for the time being. It seems solid enough, smooth mounting on both the Fuji body and the Nikon lenses. The aperture ring turns 4 indented clicks (from wide-open to fully stopped-down) but you can manipulate the ring between clicks for more precise settings, yet you can't really tell what f/stop you are at (and reads as f/\"O\" in the X-T1 display). I will say that the adapter makes even a 50mm a good inch-and-a-half longer on the camera, and makes larger Nikon lenses look ridiculously huge/long on the tiny X-T1 body.The 8-frame-per-second drive is plenty fast enough for about anything. That said, I didn't get into the Fuji system for speed. I wanted a compact system that does make me THINK again about composure and the joy of shooting manually and with thought. Too many people \"video\" with stills. Sure, I do the same sometimes with breaking spot news and sports (spurting away at 10 fps is sometimes useful), but I want this system for a different intent. Having a degree in art, I came into photography/journalism from a different angle, and I think the Fuji system gets me back there. Manual controls do in some cases hinder speed, but they make you think deliberately as well. I've always thought that mechanical apertures on lenses were much faster and easier to use however--You can flip from wide-open to stopped-down in a fraction of a second--while using your left hand--and keeping your right index finger ON the shutter.The X-T1 starts up fast and is ready to shoot immediately. Upon shut-down with the On/Off switch, a very momentary \"Sensor Cleaning\" is displayed on the LCD screen.The two big main dials (ISO and shutter speed) on the faceplate have a the lock button in the center of the dial which requires pushing in to turn. The ISO dial requires you to push in the lock button at every setting; the shutter dial only locks when in the \"A\" position--the settings can be turned freely outside of the A position.The function dials below these two bigger dials control Drive modes (on the left under ISO) and Metering modes (under the Shutter dial)--these lower dials can be switched without pushing in the Lock button. The Exposure-Compensation dial (on the far right) is also very large, but it thankfully does not lock but is well-damped and not easy to accidently turn.There is no Mode dial. You simply put both the ISO and Shutter dials on \"A' for automatic or turn them to what you want for manual. Its actually better, and less fiddling than you can imagine (particularly if you have experience shooting with a manual camera from the past film SLRs, or if you want to learn how to use a camera with a retro-manual feel).The sweep-panorama (with auto-stitching) seems to work quite well (as it does on older Fujis), I use this feature quite a bit on the X10.The multiple-exposure mode is a new design, and is quite amazing. I did infrequently use multiple exposure on my Nikons, but it required going into menus and fiddling with settings for each frame. The X-T1 will stay in the mode when the switch is set to it, but what is amazing is that it will SHOW you the two frames simultaneously in the VF--the first shot and the \"Live\" second frame--ingenious! So you can see the (faded) first frame while composing the second frame over top of it--quite useful for in-camera double-exposing.As I sadly have NO Fuji XF lenses at the moment (56 is pre-ordered) I cannot evaluate AF speed/accuracy, nor the quality of the Fujinon optics in this review. I have no reason to think they are nothing but spectacular, and would be a primary reason for owning a Fuji XF system in the first place. I did not want to spend money on the included kit lens as I plan to get the upgraded pro zoom lens and only the primes I want for my growing compact kit.I can say that the Nikon mount lenses I have tried (with adapter) so far work quite well (in aperture-priority A mode) and with MF. The focus-peaking modes and split-screen focusing features work great for manual focusing on the X-T1, making it a truly useful body even for those who want to use other-brand lenses on the great Fuji sensor.Frankly, the EVF is probably the major reason I wanted the X-T1.  It is large and bright, and reasonably fast, as has been described. I would not say it is BETTER than an OVF, but it adds to functions that are simply not possible with an OVF: such as being able to see thru the viewfinder to shoot video, watching changes to exposure/color balance, etc. as you shoot. And even though there is noticeable GAIN NOISE when shooting in very low light, you can actually see better through the EVF than with your naked eye! Not to mention, less mechanical problems with mirror alignment, much less (sound) noise with mirror slap, easier to clean sensor.  You can also preview your shot images in the EVF without taking your eye away from the camera--something that works well for someone (as myself) who sometimes needs reading glasses to see the LCD and you can see it well in bright outdoor sun.  I really think EVF is the future, whether Nikon or Canon decide to get on board or not. The EVF on this camera could be a game-changer and will only get better.There is a Silent mode that cuts off any beeps and turns off flash. As the XT-1 uses a focal plane shutter, the shutter does still make a sound in Silent Mode, but is fairly quiet and has a nice muted mechanical sound. Its still MUCH QUIETER than my Nikons, especially a pro D4 even in Quiet Mode. It would be nice to have a completely silent shutter (as other Fuji models) but I can live with it.The APS-C-sized sensor used in the X-T1 is FujiFilm's own (Trans-X) sensor, and it works quite well. The resolution is very good out of camera and with JPEGs even. It has good depth, color balance and saturation. I do think it can look more FILM-LIKE than other manufacturers' sensors, which I am sure Fuji has labored much at. The Film-Simulation modes work well too. I can't say they look exactly like their film-counterparts (and I've shot plenty of Fuji film, having finally thrown out 100' bulk-rolls of Fujichrome 50 from my refrigerator), but the effect is nice and the feature of having film-simulation in-camera is something missing from digital cameras for many years.  B/W modes (with included filters for effect) work quite well. Many old-schooler's such as myself can remember shooting BW film and how dramatic a red filter can help darken a sky--it works about as well here, digitally. BW pops and also had good tonal gradation. It's a joy to actually use it in-camera. With almost all other digital bodies, I would just convert color to BW in Photoshop. But the Fuji system makes you want to decide how you want it to look while you are shooting, something that makes the creative process somehow more fun as it is retro. (I do find it interesting that Fuji has adopted the FILM to its branding/logo for its digital cameras, as they were mainly branded just FUJI in the days that I shot their great film ;).The battery seems to last OK for what all the camera does. It could last longer, but it would make the camera bigger, and extra batteries for the Fuji X-series are cheap and pocketable. This extra set with a charger works great and is very affordable (the included charger works as well as the Fuji one and is more compact and includes a car cord) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084G3FKE/ref=oh_details_o05_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1The X-T1 body is solidly built while very compact and not too heavy either. I like that it is weatherized, as I shoot in almost any condition (another reason I am waiting for the 16-55 lens). I have the grip pre-ordered and hope to receive it soon, will add comments here....http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Vertical-Battery-Grip-X-T1/product-reviews/B00I44EUBO/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1The X-T1, while retro-looking, includes many built-in technological advances, such as the EVF...and built-in WI-FI. At the press of a single button, you can open the wi-fi and transmit photos to a smartphone or tablet, or shoot and auto-upload to a desktop (all with no added wires and additional cost parts). The FujiFilm \"CAMERA REMOTE\" APP is free. And it works amazingly well! I had no problems setting up my smartphone (android) to work with the camera, adjust settings, and shoot photos remotely from the smartphone or a tablet (Note 10.1). Previewing photos and uploading (named \"Importing\" on the app) shots from the camera to phone/tablet was also a breeze. It just works, flawlessly. You can even use touch-focus on the screen of your phone and manipulate about every manual function available on the camera.Will I completely convert to a compact camera? Probably not. I have too much invested in the Nikon DSLR system, which still works well for its intended use, particularly fast-moving action, sports, etc. The one downfall at the moment for Fuji is the flash system. I do plan to test using radio slaves on the X-T1 with strobes and studio lighting in the future, but I do not foresee having TTL flash be anywhere near the advanced state of Nikon CLS at the moment. I certainly wish the X-sync was much higher than 1/180 as well.As I use the camera more, and acquire the upcoming Fujinon XF lenses,  I will add any observations/evaluations to my review....FUJIFILM has done a great job designing and engineering this little gem of a camera. It's just a joy to use, and its full of features that are cutting-edge AND the perfect mix of retro-art-camera...in a compact size with a great clean sensor that records nice, detailed images!***ADD 3-7-2014***Some new observations:For those like me that are using non-dedicated glass with a lens adapter, i've discovered a few quirks i'd like to share. Although the Nikkors i've used with my adapter (above) work quite well in many situations, some of the strengths of the great EVF are also a weakness in this regard! Since you have to manually stop-down the lens to get the DOF/exposure you need, you also cant SEE through the EVF in some situations. For example, i was hoping to shoot a few studio shots with the X-T1 and my Nikon 85/70-200mm--even at LOW ISO (100) i could not shoot at lower than f/11 with the Elinchroms (500-2000 Watt/s heads)so having to stop-down the lens made the EVF so dim that i could not even see to focus (manually). This makes the camera less-useful in this regard. Of course, you could open lens, pre-focus, stop down and shoot, but not very practical...this is of course not Fuji's fault, as its a third-party use. (I really am looking forward to getting a XF lens--hope that 56 isn't too long in coming!)Also regarding flash/x-sync: the stated 1/180 sync is certainly the TOP USABLE SYNC SPEED from my tests thus far. I was able to get 1/250 with no shutter blackout many times using a hot-shoe attached (SB) flash in manual settings, but not in any wireless function. I'd hoped it would be possible to get up to 250th in manual flash scenerios, but certainly not with the (1st gen)PWs and other radio slaves i've tested so far (this is to be expected as the RF will slow down the transmission though).This is certainly a bit of a let-down for me personally, as i would love to be able to shoot flash outdoors and still use wide apertures. And the combination of ISO 100 (really 200) and a slow 1/180 sync is just not that useful. It would be nice to have a body with a much more substantial range of lower ISO--if there was a way to keep the decent high ISO as well ;) Haven't shot Kodachrome25 or Fujichrome50 is quite a few years now, but an ISO of 25 could be useful for some instances, or a built-in ND filter, OR find a way to get that x-sync MUCH faster!***ADD 3-10-2014***I've received my Vertical Grip for the X-T1 and have reviewed it here:http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Vertical-Battery-Grip-X-T1/product-reviews/B00I44EUBO/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1Like the camera even more with the attached grip--more comfortable to hold, much easier to shoot in vertical orientation. Does make it taller but its still smaller and thinner than a DSLR with grip. Looks even more like an SLR of course, but it looks very nice and the fit and finish is very good, perfectly complements the camera.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Finally a digital that really handles like an Old School SLR", "Author": "ILoveWood", "ReviewID": "R12VAPH6VOFW61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this last night and wow. If your an old film SLR shooter like me and haven't been impressed with any of the mirror-less offerings this camera might win you over. I've waited a very long time, since the later 90's to find a digital camera that I could afford that was fast enough and small enough  that I'd actually want to carry it with me. With the pancake lens this camera should be that camera. (I'm waiting on prime lens)The auto focus is FAST, the lens (18-55 kit) is solid and smooth with very good image quality. The film simulations are fun. This camera handles like an old SLR. The dials are GREAT. I can shoot and shoot without having to dig through menus. Everyone talks about how amazing the EVF is, well I'm glad I waited for this \"dramatic improvement\" because frankly anything less would be  unacceptable. It's still electronic and you get the occasional flicker and can be a little grainy at times (night time B & W) , but it's bright, big and shows all kinds of shooting info. The flash is kind of goofy but seems to work well enough. Since it doesn't have any batteries I wonder how it will effect the camera's battery life.For just a little more than the x100s you can get this body $1299 and the 27 f2.8 pancake lens for $199 (Amazon promotion) and have a much better camera which can be expanded later with the power grip, prime lenses etc. (I got the kit lens since I'm starting out and I have the pancake lens on order)Here's a link to that lens deal.http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00DCM0DUU/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition;=newUPDATE: I've been shooting for a week and all I can say is WOW! This camera is amazing, it's easy to use, produces great images and is compact enough to carry even with the 18-55.  I still haven't got the pancake lens (it's on order) but if it performs like the 18-55 I'll be in heaven. The battery life is not great. It seems to require daily charging and if I don't plan for it I have to wait. This has cause me to miss a few opportunities but I just received two spares and will start bringing at least one of them with me. I really love the high contrast \"presets\".The image stabilization of the 18-55 lens works very, very well. I can hand-hold long exposures with a high percentage of usage photos. It's a joy having IS and really makes (for me) a tripod optional for much of my shooting.The quality of the body is impressive, this thing is SOLID. The controls feel great etc. People complain about accidentally pressing buttons and yes that does happen. You can either reassign the functions or like me, learn to be aware of where your fingers are and be careful.My next purchase will be a FAST lens, most likely the 35 f1.4 since it seems to be the best compromise for performance, size and price.  The included flash is OK but not really able to fill a large room. For now, I'd rather have a fast lens than a better flash unit.CONCLUSION:This is an amazing camera, the image quality is first rate. It handles like a old school slr.  Its a cliche but in the simplest terms taking photos is fun again.

Others are great on the design, but don't match up to the best in class when in comes to image quality.The XT1 shines in both respects.  The images are the best I have ever seen out of any camera (and I have owned about 40 digital cameras over the last 15 years).  While many cameras force you to use RAW to get the best image quality.  The JPEG engine on the XT1 is so good, most people will likely not bother with the RAW.  (I know that this sounds like heresy to some pros and enthusiasts).As far as the ergonomics, if you like retro-style with dials and buttons to select your photo shooting options, then you will love this camera.  For most settings you don't need to dig through menus.  You have dials for exposure compensation, shutter speed,  ISO settings, Bracket/Continuous Shoots/Single shot/panorama etc., spot/matrix/center weighted metering (that is my favorite).  A flag style dial on the front of the camera lets you select autofocus modes or manual focus.  You can also access the various settings with the menu button.  For the most important settings, you can press the Q button on the back which brings up a screen that shows the major settings on the camera.  You can make the changes you want right on the screen.  I like to set NR to -1, and Sharpness to +1.The Electronic View Finder (EVF)is large, and gives you a view that rivals an optical viewfinder...except it provides way more information.  It works very well whether you wear glasses or not.  I love the way the LCD automatically turns off when you look through the EVF, and then turns on automatically as you pull your eye away from the EVF.  You can customize virtually everything you seen on the EVF and LCD screens.For the best responsiveness (fast auto-focus and fast time from turning on the camera to first shot), I highly recommend you go to Power Management in the 2nd Set Up menu and turn on HIGH PERFORMANCE.  It uses more battery, but I did not find that a problem.  Once you have it on, auto focus is lightning fast.  Auto-focus is able lock in very fast.  Where my Fuji XE1 hunts and takes a while to Auto-focus, the XT1 locks in instantly.  Very impressive.The WiFi button on the top plate worked well with the Fuji App on my Ipad.  I could control the camera (although I don't know what I would use that function for) and I could import pictures into the Ipad (very useful).There are several button on the camera that you can customize to work the particular function you want...like ISO selection, Face Detection, and many others.Some people complain about the 4 way buttons being a bit to indented.  Perhaps this is so.  But I had no problem with them.There is only one negative I could find, and it wasn't a big deal.  The Movie button is a bit too easy to press accidentally.Overall, this is a superb camera...the best camera I have ever owned. The images are absolutely first rate...even for the pixel peepers out there.Highly, Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Camera? I think so", "Author": "F. R.

My Sony a99 was better in terms of color accuracy and yet still gave me problems with skin tone and noise. Yes, you can say I'm picky, can't help it.This is my first Fuji camera, and I have to say Fuji nailed it. Few reasons why I love this camera:1- BABY FUJI is small, light weight, and sexy. You can take it everywhere with you without being noticed unlike Nikon and Canon big heavy cameras + decent lenses.2- COLORS are amazing.There are Film simulation modes for studio portrait, outdoor portrait, landscape, and Black&White.; The best jpegs I've seen straight out of the camera, don't have to spend much time in Photoshop or Lightroom.3- TRIPOD - don't need to spend a lot of $$$ on expensive tripods and ballheads for stabilization and support.4- EASY CONTROLS at your fingertips. ISO dial, Shutter Speed dial, and you can control the aperture on the lens by rotating the aperture ring.5- EVF - The largest view finder with split screen option for manual focusing making sure your image is sharp.You can still use this camera with pocket wizards for wireless triggering of strobes or camera flashes from other brands.* SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE!", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Overall great camera with a few annoyances", "Author": "Edward V. Yezekian", "ReviewID": "R2NDX1H62WKBTB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I dropped my whole canon kit (5D Mark II plus 4 L Prime lenses) for the X-T1.  up until this camera, i didn't think the CSC space was mature enough, the X-Pro1 was good, but not quite there, and the X-E2 at the time of it's release was also, not quite there.  With the exception with a small handful of petty grievances, this may be as perfect a camera you can get in the compact System Camera sector.Image Quality - one word superb.  the 16mp X-Trans CMOS II sensor is capable of so much detail, and contrast.  the colors are great as well.  Auto White balance seems to do a pretty good job in judging a scene.  The lenses I have used so far - 18-55 f/2.8-4 kit, 35mm f/1.4 and 56mm f/1.2 are all very very good, and sharp and contrasty.  I dont miss any of my canon glass, except maybe my 135mm f/2.0L, which Fuji does not have an analog for, however, i picked myself up a leica 90mm Summicron-M f/2 and a 3rd party M-X adapter, and it does nicely.  I would however love to see a fuji AF enabled fast 90mm lens.Handling - not bad at all.  My hands have been described as meat hooks, but i have to say, the camera is very comfortable to hold, even without the add on grip extenders that are available.  the buttons are a bit crowded on the back, but that is to be expected on such a compact design.  After a short time of use, you get use to it, and its not that much of a big deal anymore.Shooting - Viewfinder is amazing, LCD is great, AF is very good, high speed shooting is very doable.menus - not too bad, i love the customizable function buttons, everything is pretty easy to get to with only a few clicks at most.  I do have one major wish that COULD be fixed in firmware, so fujidoods, if you're listening, read below.greivances:1/4000 max shutter and base ISO 200(RAW) - losing 1 full stop with the shutter, plus another with the high base ISO make daylight shooting with wide(r) apertures challenging.  I used to shoot f/1.2 1/8000 iso 50 in bright sun, this is something that cannot be done on this camera without the use of ND filters, which also darkens the view finder, and all but the best quality filters affect the image negatively.unable to customize quick menu.  I would LOVE to customize the Q menu with my most used features.  this would greatly reduce my time thumbing through the various menusISO dial lock can be annoying, but not the end of the world.The electronic Aperture ring on the lenses are too easily moved, while zooming, Manual focusing, or even during shooting while holding the lens.  a clicking aperture ring would prevent this, or moving the aperture function to the front control wheel would help as well, though that would make it somewhat painful to use.  CLICKING APERTURE RING!Unable to shoot tethered in the studio.  Attaching a USB cord disables the camera.  using the remote control feature with wireless is somewhat useful, but MUCH less, when you want to shoot from the camera position (hand held) and want to send images to a laptop or tablet automatically.  I like to shoot RAW+Small JPEG in studio, and send the JPEG to my laptop while keeping the RAW on the Flash Card.  the only way to do this type of photography right now is with a 3rd party eyefi card.  This should be able to be fixed with a new firmware to allow hardwired tethering, or eyefi like wireless tethering.Lack of a fast telephoto prime for portrait shooters (90mm f/2.0 or 1.8)  OIS would be gravy, though not required by me.In fact on sensor OIS would have been niceThis camera with a 23mm f/1.4, 35mm f/1.4, 56mm f/1.2, and a fast 90mm is the ultimate kit covering everything that I shoot.  I dont miss anything from my 5D Mark II, especially not the weight with all those heavy L lenses.  You do lose a little shallow DOF (not enough of a difference for it to mean much to me), But IQ and Lens quality in such a small package is very hard to beat.NOTE:  if you like to shoot video, this is not your camera.  It lacks everything a serious videographer would want, except maybe the stereo mic input, but then again, most every other serious video camera has that anyway.Thank you Fujifilm!

JENSEN", "ReviewID": "R1X2D79C8T47Y8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting SLR/DSLR for a long time. I got tired of the size. If my computers, televisions, cars, phones, and everything else can shrink then so shall my cameras. However, most mirrorless/CSC cameras are geared towards casual momtographer types. As the field has expanded, more options have been produced for serious users. I can't really consider the Olympus or Panasonic offerings as I can't take the small format particularly seriously. Your mileage may vary, but, I expect you are reading this review because you came to a similar conclusion.So here's the deal. This camera, in terms of usability and performance, is right on par (in my opinion, obviously) with the Nikon D7000. In many ways it feels like a similar camera. Better, actually. It is faster in nearly every way. The HUGE EVF is vastly bigger and clearer in all conditions than the small dim D7000 OVF. Perhaps in some cases a full frame camera's OVF is superior to an EVF, but, never an APS-C camera's OVF. They are very dark and very small.I have personally proven the new tracking AF capability personally. I have tracked accelerating light rail trains, cyclists, birds IN FLIGHT, cars and skateboarders all with high degrees of success! Huzzah! It's very impressive. It was really hard to believe. I checked those pictures a hundred times. *IT REALLY WORKS*Everything else about image quality is identical to the X-E2, and all the quality you have come to expect from Fujifilm X cameras is intact. Most of the differences besides speed and comfort are shifts in user interface. You will love or hate each detail just like everyone does with every camera. I personally am very pleased with the majority of the design decisions here. I wish the video record button could be repurposed as a Fn button as I will never use this camera for video which reminds me...Video is still lackluster here. No Fuji X cameras have useful video modes. It's fine for maybe a casual home video of the kid. Its tracking AF system works in video but transitions extremely slowly (which is actually often the way to go to avoid making people sick watching your videos, but, doesn't help much for a fast moving kid or any action). So don't buy this if you're serious about video. Just don't. If you are serious about stills but want some decent video, I suggest buying this camera and a separate dedicated video camera. If that doesn't sound good, well, maybe this isn't your camera.This is a stills photographer's camera.Anyway, you can find a million reviews on the web for this camera. The points I wish to make for you here are that I've shot with a number of cameras of varying degrees of performance both mirrorless/csc and SLR/DSLR. This camera is a step above the APS-C crop of CSC cameras and totally worth your time if you're looking for something that will blend well with you as a photographer and not get in your way when the situation speeds up.Sports, wildlife, kids, people, cars, models, city, street, nature, whatever. This camera is capable for everything. It may not match a $6,500 top end DSLR, but, it is certainly not going to completely stop you from whatever you're trying to shoot.

I do like to have the option of an automatic mode, but most of the time I want to set the speed and aperture manually and with some thought behind it. The thumb wheels that act as substitutes for the dials have never seemed natural to me and I have always hated them.When Fujifilm came out with the X-series of rangefinder style cameras, I had to try them and instantly fell in love with them after seeing the glorious results.

All they hype about this camera is well warranted\u2026it is a great camera.While the X-E1 offers the same image quality, the performance is just not on the same level.  My main complaint about the X-E1 was the lagging AF, which is always a hit or miss, the small and jittery EVF, and the small and low resolution rear LCD.  The X-T1 has great focusing in terms of both, speed and accuracy (I have lenses 18mm f2, 35mm f1.4, and 60mm f2.4).  The EVF is almost like an OVF it is so good and large.  The rear LCD is big and feels like high quality glass (or whatever it is made of).  All in all a great performer.

Why is the flash compensation buried in the menus?The SD card door feels weak even when closed.  It does not attach firmly to the camera body.The arrow buttons were not designed correctly\u2026they are a bit concave (vs. domed in the X-E1) which makes pressing them a bit of a pain.  Thankfully, once you set up your custom settings, there is not much of a need to mess around with these things.Compared to other cameras I own / have owned:vs. X-E1 - much faster response times and focus performance, better EVF and LCD displays.vs. OMD-EM5 \u2013 better ergonomics, better EVF and LCD displays, better Image quality, equally good response times and focusing performancevs. D600 - aesthetics and portability are X-T1 advantages, but I guess that is it.

The problem is that they are both so great. But there are negatives as well as positives for each. Every one raves about the superb view finder of the X-Ti, and it is great, but doing a side by side comparison, the E-M1 has a brighter view. With the sun at a certain angle it was at times difficult seeing the X-T1 image on the screen and viewfinder. The E-M1 remained clear regardless of the angle of the sun. However the view through the Fuji was larger. The retro. dials on the Fuji make adjustments very easy. The Olympus also is easy to adjust, but I think fuji wins out in this department. The olympus shutter speed goes to 1/8000 vs 1/4000 for the Fuji. Neither has an ND filter so shooting with the fuji f1.4 lenses or their forthcoming f1.2 lens in bright sunlight wide open would be more of a problem than with the Olympus. At this price point the Fuji should have gone to 1/8000.Fuji has some superb beautifully constructed and needle sharp lenses. Olympus can use a huge selection of micro 4/3 lenses including many excellent ones from Panasonic, so you have more of a choice. However the Olympus micro 4/3 sensor is smaller than that of the Fuji and at higher iso produces more noise. Finally, Olympus wins out in the image stabilization department with its in body stabilization. Any lens you use on it will be stabilized. Also, in my 70 years of owning many cameras and lenses I've never seen an image stabilizer as good as that of the Olympus. Olympus wins by a wide margin in that department.Another advantage for Olympus is in the placement of the tripod socket. I have many arca compatible plates and all blocked the battery compartment on the Fuji. But I'm sure that third party plates will be available before too long that solve this problem. Fuji will be distrbuting their MHG-XT Metal Hand Grip in a week or two which will provide access to the battery compartment and which will be compatible with arca swiss style heads.As I'm writing this it seems that the advantage goes to Olympus and my choice should be obvious, however the images from the Fuji are simply breath taking.

After having settled on a Leica M typ 240, I got my hands on one and after only a very few moments knew it was not the body for me.  For me, the ergonomics were all wrong, beautiful and elegantly crafted as the body and lenses are.  Perhaps I should have stuck with it a bit longer, but I walked away and began my research anew.I decided on the Fujifilm X-T1 and its array of lenses, but again without actually handling the device.  I purchased one mail order from Amazon; when it arrived I was impressed with the build quality of both the body and kit lens (which I bought on the advice of existing reviews).  All the movements and adjustments are well defined and positive.  Not heavy, the camera and lens fit well together and feel rock solid.  Though I have relatively large hands, this diminutive camera fits them well and all the controls seem placed precisely where I would want them.  The mechanical and digital controls are duplicative; consequently, as one shoots, one cn choose how one will operate, from the digital screen menu or \"the old fashioned way,\" turning dials and collars and pressing buttons.  I appreciate such flexibility.  Further, one can configure the camera and lenses to shoot in virtually any manner one desires.  The possibilities for creativity seem endless, and I look forward to working through them.I will soon buy additional lenses, first, the 14 mm f 2.8 and the 23 mm f 1.4, the first for landscape, of course, the second for \"street\" photography, portraiture and low light occasions.  One can have complete control over all the settings of each, which is not true of the \u201ckit\u201d lens.  Normally, I would not purchase a \"kit\" lens, but this one lives up to the best reviews others have given it.What comes in the box allows one to get started, although I would have appreciated having a UV haze filter included.  I did not use the camera until I had one in place.  As for the EVF that has received exceptionally high praise:  I find it quite bright, easy to bring to the eye (I wear glasses), full of information and generally one of the unit\u2019s stronger features.  In its class, it\u2019s probably as good as is to be found; however, working with Leica\u2019s EVFs as I have the last couple of years, I would say the X-T1\u2019s is competitive but not superior.At present, based on little field experience with the X-T1, my sole negative comment concerns the battery charging unit.  To be sure, it functions properly, but it and its cord\u2014a cord?  why a cord?\u2014are huge and awkward by contemporary standards.  Here, Fujifilm should take a lesson from Canon and Leica who provide small, easily packed, efficient chargers.  I travel a great deal, and saving room is important to me.  So Fujifilm provides a small, light, ergonomically and aesthetically pleasing body, superb lenses, a small, almost tiny flash unity and then saddles one with an inconveniently sized battery charger.

I would like to just mention what I like and what I do not like or where there is a room for improvement on Fuji XT1. First a little bit about my previous shooting experience. Note that I am not a professional but a serious amateur who often engages in paid jobs too but photography is more of my passion than my job. I have been shooting primarily canon (started with Canon 300D, 20D, 5D, 5D MKii and many L lenses) and whenever I need more flash or strobist type of work, I would shoot Nikon D700. See some examples here on flicker.[...]As most of you would agree that when the above equipment is not being used, it is laying safely packed in camera bags and it is a project in itself to get them out and shoot. With my growing age, I felt the need of having a camera that would sit on my desk, waiting for being picked up anytime I want and is lightweight but have a fast lens, even a fixed fast lens. Fuji released X100 and I got it in its very early days. See the unboxing pictures of X100 here (play as a slideshow with music);[...]It had lots of limitations but it brought passion and fun back into my shooting. The limitations were mostly on the hardware, not the picture quality which was premium. Soon I felt that if I have a body that produces the quality of fuji files with an interchangeable lens, I can shoot lot more than I can do with my canon or nikon but I also felt that the mirrorless technology needs bit of time to mature. So I waited until XPro1 came along. I bought XPro1 with 14mm f/2.8, 35mm f/1.4, 55-200 and 60mm f/2.4 macro. I was blown away by the quality of hardware and of course by the quality of files.  See my XPro1 equipment photos here (play as a slideshow)[...]I however was not at all happy with autofocus speed and felt it needs a huge improvement there also I felt that a good quality EVF improvement will change the game as \"CHIMPING\" will not be required. On my canon and Nikon, since I cannot see what excatly my final picture will look like so I had to preview often how does my picture looks like in terms of exposure and bokeh.  With EVF I was able to see the photo exactly as it would turn out after shooting. So the story continues but I did not like the refresh rate on the XPRO 1 and the fact that it was bit clumsy to respond but the picture and the build quality of the equipment kept me shooting with it. A few months later came XT1. What a game changer it has been. The EVF is bright, big and beautiful. If you shoot with fast lenses most of the time, you will be amazed at kind of 3D effect that it gives you when you see through the view finder. Soon after getting it, I went on a trip to Malaysia and Singapore and with reluctance in my mind that should I take my trusted DSLR's with me or only take fuji XT1 with me, I took both. But wallah, after shooting first day, I kept my nikon with its 14-24 f/2.8 and 24-70 f/2.8 securely packed in my bag, while I shot 90% of the trip with Fuji XT1, 14mm f/2.8 and 35 mm f/1.4 and some with 55-200 mm lens. I came back as a happy traveler with some amazing shots from Fuji. My pros and cons are now based on my 5 days of continuous shooting with XT1, 14mm f/2.8 and 35mm f/1.4.Strengths:1. Excellent files output, it is first time in my life I felt comfortable letting the camera process the Black and white jpgs for me, while I kept the color version RAW for later processing. The out of camera jpg's Black and white will blow you away. I can share the settings for Black and white jpg in camera processing if someone wants them.2. Great EVF, big, bright and something that will put much fun and pleasure in your shooting.3. Great in your hand feel5. Lightweight and very much in stealth mode for street and candid shooting. The whole kit (fuji xt1, 14mm f/2.8, 35mm f/1.4 and 55-200 were still lighter (or almost same) weight as my Nikon D700 plus 14-24 f/2.8 lens)6.  I like the viewfinder in the middle like DSLR rather than on the side as rangefinder camera or on XPro1 but that is only a personal preference.7. I was able to transfer the black and white jpgs through camera's in built wifi to my iphone and straight to facebook. My family in Pakistan and saudi arabia were updated in minutes of my finishing a tour of a place.8. The biggest advantage, it has brought fun back to my shooting without adding any weight to my camera bag.Weaknesses:1. I feel that the Autofocus mode for sports is still lacking and a improvement there will bring fuji huge benifits to their business.2. A full frame body will take Fuji's business to the heights they have never dreamt of.

However the low-light performance and light weight make it ideal for travel, scenic, weddings and excursions into dimly lit music venues. Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Initial Impressions", "Author": "MGeorge321", "ReviewID": "R3CFNYRNRGF1SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm used to full sized DSLRs. I have a 5Dmk2 that I use personally, and a 7D that I use at work. I've gotten tired of dragging a full frame DSLR around with me at all times in my personal life just to shoot little shots of my fiance, or a bird, or whatever, since it's very truly overkill, especially with a zoom lens that gives you the flexibility to get most shots when you don't know what you're going to encounter.To get around that issue,, I had bought an X100s, and used it for about three months, and I sold it, because it didn't do what I wanted. Turns out I liked the design of the camera, and the image quality, but the lack of interchangeable lenses and my lack of confidence in the AF system ended up being a bigger issue than I thought.Enter the X-T1 - It was delivered yesterday, and I've only used it to take about 20 test shots of boring stuff in bad light so far, so take that into account when reading -First is the feel. It feels awesome. Very VERY solid. Nice texture to the surfaces, nice tension to all the knobs, nice \"cold\" feeling on the metal, and even attaching the kit lens was a very confidence inspiring process. It's solid but not heavy. Or, heavy, but not too heavy? If that makes sense. It's heavy the way an iPhone is heavy. You feel it in your hand, and it makes you confident that it's high quality, but at no point are you upset that it's as heavy as it is.It's also small. I've got somewhat small hands, with somewhat short fingers, and this thing still feels tiny in my grip. At first, this bothered me, but then I remembered why I bought it, and suddenly I was glad. It's certainly nowhere near pocket-able, but I'll be able to set it on a table while out to dinner with my fiance without having to ask for a table for three like I do with my 5Dmk2.The battery took about two hours to reach full charge out of the box (I'm sure I could have played with the camera with the amount of charge that came on the battery, but it's a habit of mine from the bad old days of battery conditioning).Turning it on and bringing it to my eye brought the first real disappointment. I'm VERY used to an optical viewfinder, and a solid large \"man sized\" grip on my cameras. Bringing the X-T1 to my eye gave me the impression that I was holding a very very high quality toy camera, rather than a small professional camera. The grip is slightly smaller than what is comfortable (for someone used to a 5D2 and 7D) and the viewfinder is... well, it's an EVF. Let me be clear. There was nothing at all that was lacking in the viewfinder, and the grip being small is the reason I wanted the camera. I'm very sure I'll grow used to both, and it won't be an issue. In use, the viewfinder is great. I've set up many of my preferences for the display inside, and it's big and bright and quick and snappy enough to suit all of my needs. It really is everything it's cracked up to be. But I'm still conditioned to prefer the OVF.Another issue with the camera to my eye is the buttons on the back of the camera. I'm sure this will go away once I've got my muscle memory worn in, but as someone who knows what the buttons do, but not where they are, I simply can't find them with the camera to my eye. I know they're there, but the buttons themselves sit flush against the back of the camera. On my Canons, all the buttons are different textures, or raised, or lowered from the surface of the body, but on the X-T1, this isn't so. Also, there are so MANY buttons that when you DO find one, you're not sure which one you've found. Am I touching the Focus assist button like I want to be? Or is it the Q button? Oh well, I'll push it and see. Oh it was the AEL button all along. Etc. Again, I'm SURE that I'll get much more used to this, and it won't be an issue, but as a photographer who's used to picking up a camera and shooting right away, it's a bit daunting to not feel instantly confident with a tool as you're accustomed to.My biggest concern with paying $1700 for this kit was the auto focus performance. A secondary reason for returning the X100s was the AF system. It was slower than I liked, and when in the OVF tunnel-finder view mode, it wasn't very reliable, especially at wider apertures. I found myself focused on the background, rather than my subject, probably 10% of the time. So I was concerned about the X-T1 also.From the testing I did yesterday, I'm no longer concerned. As I said in the beginning, I was shooting test shots in pretty bad low lighting (indoors, with only a single lamp, at around 8pm with the blinds closed) and while the AF doesn't SNAP like my DSLRs do, it's very VERY fast, and so far, 100% accurate. I only have the kit lens so far, and I know with this system, the AF speed varies depending on the lens, but the kit lens at least is plenty for my uses. I wish there was focus peaking in the AF modes, or full time MF override, to help me feel more confident about it all, but that's just my insecurity, rather than something I need, since it really seems like the AF system will be fine.It's going to take some time to get my image tone settings picked out, but I usually shoot RAW+Fine JPEG, in monochrome mode, so that I get an initial black and white JPEG (which I like) and then the ability to change the image over to color in post if I'd like. Setting this up wasn't hard, and I was pretty pleased with the results I was getting on the LCD.It's definitely a complex little machine, with TONS of customization options (6 assignable function buttons? Really? So cool!) so it will be a long time before I settle into a setup that I'm most pleased with, but knowing that I have those options is a huge comfort.I plan on buying the battery grip, the 56mm f/1.2, one of the smaller pancake style lenses, and eventually, the 50-140mm f/2.8 (when it comes out) to round out my kit, as well as an aftermarket strap (The Fuji straps are never long enough for me)All in all, I'm very pleased, and excited to get to know my new friend.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm Is Constantly Improving Their Camera Bodies.

Dyrkacz", "ReviewID": "R2CVEHN20HKDRL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I started off with a 5 star review, but after owning it for a little less than a month had to down grade it. Read review to find out why.3/11/2014Build:Very solid build. The entire camera including the kit lens have a very pro feel to them. The dials seem very tight. Actually the exposure comp dial is a little too tight. I wanted a tight dial on the x100s because it turns easily when i put it in my pocket, but this is not a pocket camera and does not need such a tight dial. Same goes for the on off switch. It does add to a general feeling of quality, but may become a problem when you're trying to quickly change settings on the fly. The other thing which I think could have been better is the ISO dial. The lock engages as you turn the wheel so you have to hold it down. This makes it more difficult than it has to be. It could have been a press to lock, press to unlock type button. This would have given security and ease of use. maybe the x-t2 will have this. =)Build Update 4/3/2014I just downgraded the camera because of a build issue. I have discovered that the little door covering the HDMI port has some \"give\" to it. This is because it is part plastic part rubber. This allows it to bend a little leaving some space between the door and the camera. This means it is not really well sealed and therefore definately NOT weather resistant. It also leads to the door unintentionally opening if you scrape it with your finger. I could put a piece of tape over it and live with it and feel I may have to do just that, but I don't feel I should have to do that on a $1700 camera. I would expect to see this on a $300 not a $1700 camera. I feel that this is a huge flaw and can't believe Fuji released a camera with this issue. Otherwise I really really like the camera. I reached out to Cardinal Camera (the third party seller I bought it from) to see if they can help. I am already past their 15 day return policy so my expectations are low, but I still hope that they do something. If they take it back I will most likely buy the OMD E-M1 instead. This is really dissapointing because other than this I really liked the camera.A little more about Cardinal Camera. This is the third party vendor i bought it from. If I was to do it again I would not have bought it from them, but instead waited until Amazon had it in stock. I reached out to them with some concerns and have not heard back. I was out of their 15 day return policy, but at least they could have responded. Instead they did not even acknowledge the messages i sent them. So I will avoid them in the future and suggest to everyone they do the same. Also their return policy is a bit short especially compared to Amazon.Handling:The grip is nice and adds a much needed support, although it should have been bigger. I will be adding the additional hand grip... not the battery grip just the extra grip.There have been many reviews complaining about the recessed buttons on the back of the camera. I guess I see what they mean but it really isn't that bad. I don't think i would have noticed it if i did not read those reviews. More importantly though IT DOES NOT MATTER. I never have to touch them except when I'm learning about the camera and setting it up for the first time. After that I never have to go into the menu again. That is the real beauty of this camera. Everything is a physical dial or switch away.The back command dial should be programmable to control something... for example ISO. The front one controls shutter, but only in increments right around where your shutter dial is set. It should cover the entire range.AF & General Speed:The camera is fast. Very fast. From turning it on putting it up to your eye and snapping 8 pictures a second with continuous AF. it is all very smooth. AF seems much better than the one in the x100s. Much faster and the continuous AF is great. The x100s continuous AF was useless. The x-t1 focuses fast even in low light. I had a few chances to use the continuous AF with the Continuous High speed shooting of my kids running or riding bicycles outside. The results were awesome. I could not have gotten such results from a Nikon D90 or the D7000.EVF:The EVF is nice, but to be honest i did not notice a huge difference from the one in the x100s. I'm sure my opinion here will change as I live with it for a while though.Other Notes:The batteries for this are different than the ones in the x100s. That was a disappointment for me, but considering all of the extra features in this camera it needs a bigger battery. Since they already changed the battery I wish they would have made it even bigger and allowed the camera to take 500+ shots on it. I will report more on battery life in the near future.Tilt Screen:I have always been of the opinion that real cameras don't need tilt screens. I was wrong. I have been able to capture pictures from perspectives which I otherwise would never have been able to shoot without it. An example of this is putting the camera almost on the ground and using the continuous AF and continuous high speed drive mode to get awesome shoots of my son riding his bike through a puddle. The tilt screen made it possible and even in full sun i was able to use it this way.WifiI have to say that the wifi connection to the phone is very cool. It works flawlessly and is fast. I hope fuji allows long exposures (more than 30 seconds) from this app so that we do not have to buy a separate remote for long exposure photography. If they could add something that could help with metering for long exposures that would be awesome as well.Update 3/18/2014I have done extensive tests of the light leak issue.

I have found the Fuji is easy to handle, has a slim profile, and feels solid in my hand. The auto-focusing is the one thing I noticed as most different: at first, I was a little annoyed with the extra time and button pushes required to select focusing points and focusing area. However, after some easy customization of the four rear buttons, I was satisfied I could quickly select my focusing options. With the other cameras I owned, Sony being just one brand, the Fuji's lenses are very sharp, and I didn't have to purchase \"L\" lenses, or premium full-frame lenses to get the quality equal to the Fuji lenses - the four I now have are very sharp. That was what I was looking for: highest quality lenses, matched for a specific camera and sensor. I choose this camera over the Micro Four Thirds systems (I owned them both) because of the better high ISO resolution: I shoot mostly in low-light. I noticed the difference right away over the MFT cameras - the Fuji is outstanding in this respect. If it did not deliver on lens sharpness or high ISO resolution, I would not keep it.

I've been a fan of the mirror-less system since it was first introduced with the 4x3rds but there was never any camera that I thought was worth keeping because the lenses were average or the sensors were behind the rest of the market.Pros:  The size, the build quality, the image quality, and complete control over the final image.  I like the way they thought this out and included everything even time lapse and monochrome with red, or yellow, or orange, etc.  I've had experience with Fuji's excellent view camera lenses which are as good as, or better, than any manufacturer in the world and they blew the pro photographers away in the 90s with great films like Velvia and Provia, and I see that kind of thinking here.  It's quick and starts up almost instantly.  This camera with the kit lens is an excellent value and I can't wait to get a prime lens to put on it. Update, the kit lens is a really good lens, so good that I'm going to pass on a prime for now.  I also bought the 55 - 200 mm and it's another really good lens.

I purchased with the 18-55mm kit lens. I'm still in the familiarizing phase, working with the various features. And it has many. I especially like the focus peak option for focus assist. It really helps my aging eyes. I use the manual focus setting quite a bit, and the AF-L button, then the manual focus ring.I very rarely have to delve into a menu. The ISO control, aperture control, shutter speed, and EV control are all external. I can do exposure bracketing via external dial. The only thing I go into menu for lately is setting rear curtain flash.Images are phenomenally crisp. I had rented the X-T1 and fujinon 60mm macro lens. I'd someday like to have that lens, but in the meanwhile, I picked up a Nikkor 55mm f/2.8 which does 1:2 not true 1:1 macro. I purchased the fotodiox nik-fx adapter to use the nikkor on the fuji x mount camera. The X-T1 can do aperture priority, choosing an appropriate shutter speed for the aperture set on the lens. Manual focus only, but as I mentioned above, that focus peak assist is marvelous. I even got the nikon M2 extension tube to do real 1:1 macro.I did have to purchase a new Yongnuo 603C II flash transmitter/receiver set. The X-T1 won't fire my older 603C transceivers.I'm having to amend how I grasp the camera. The aperture ring of the 18-55mm is very close to the camera body. It's easy for me to inadvertently change the aperture. But the camera body and lens are so light that I don't need to hold on the lens as I would with my Canon gear. I didn't have that problem with the fuji 60mm macro.The camera is pretty small. I'm still adapting to grasping it without pressing some button. There is one button that I'm actually having trouble finding when I want it. That's the focus assist button adjacent to the LCD. At times I want to use it to enlarge the view of the focus area, but not as often now that I'm using focus peaking. I've read from someone who had put a small stick-on button on the camera's button. I might go that route.Once I accidentally began recording a video. A couple times I turned on the power when pulling the camera out of my bag.

So this is a bug on how AF-L works in manual focus. If you set focus to Continuous, it actually is able to lock (green light stays turned on confirming focus is ok) although you keep pressing half way the shutter button (as continuous focus should work). But if you set focus to manual, and set \"Instant AF setting\" to \"AF-C\" (what should work as back button focus mode), when you do the same test as before, the focus never locks, and the green light turns on and off and never locks, so some photos will be on focus, if you by chance take it when the light is green. Note, that on both cases I'm focusing exactly the same black bar next to a white background with plenty of light.Edit April 8: Lightroom 5.4 is out now recognizes XT1 files, and added a try on film simulations (nice for the effort), but demosaicing has not improved at all with smudged foliage and texture (I've read PhotoNinja or Iridient make a much better job converting RAF files). At least now you can manage your files from LR (converting them with export from LR).Wanted to mention that SOOC JPG's are great, very impressive actually (contrasting to the poor photos with bad sharpening+artifacts from LR). Don't know why Fuji doesn't work with Adobe to have something near in quality to the in camera RAW converter.Edit March 15: Fuji-US \"flare effect\" on cameras up to SN:41A05201, plus free repair goo.gl/g3VFXLEdit March 14: Finally Fuji Japan acknowledged the issue and offer free repair in Japan... let's hope it's world wide in the future, goo.gl/LOC0tVAt least a better approach than other manufacturers (Nikon D600) that never acknowledge issues and wouldn't offer free repairs in a million years.Edit March 16: Tried to use it for a portrait session, and sadly the back button focus \"mode\" (Focus in manual, and using AF-L to focusing) is very inaccurate for precise focusing and shallow depth of field, because, as I mentioned in my first impressions the focusing area in manual focus mode, although you can change its position, you can't change its size!, and the default size it's huge compared to an eye in a portrait, so at the end I couldn't use the back button focus option at all :(... It will be very disappointing for all of those who use back button focus unless you don't need a precise focus. As I said before, I hope Fuji will add this option (change focus area size) also to manual focus mode.Also as I also mentioned before, with the 35mm f/1.4 the continuous focus never locks and keeps searching/moving after reaching focus, so again for back focus button \"mode\" (with continuous focus, as back button focus is supposed to be used) can't really be used with shallow depth of field, so have to set the back button focus to single and not continuous, which takes away lot of the advantages of back button focus (having single and continuos focus all in one without changing settings).Using the Rokinon 85mm f/1.4+Metabones speedbooster, creates great images, with amazing out of focus area and great FF look images, and it's actually usable manually focusing wide open (softer images though than with something equivalent on a FF DSLR), contrary to manual focusing this lens on any DSLR I have ever tried before (even with a focusing screen I once installed). So at least finally I can use this great and cheap lens.==== ORIGINAL REVIEW (March 9):The Fuji X-T1 comes with a light leak ( pic: goo.gl/s6xJOn or google search it or view video on youtube documenting the issue on probably all X-T1 up to date), so if you do long exposure photography at night or like using dark ND filters at daylight shooting exposures of more than 30 seconds (only current way to do it is opening the door with the leak). I bought it in the States but live in South America, so can't send it back easily. Shame on Fuji for poor quality control and for rushing the release of the camera.My initial impressions, very disappointed as you can imagine, receiving a defective new 1900 USD camera (body+35mm) plus the following issues (known or not):The D-pad is bad!, small, too difficult to press, no tactile feedback when pressing, and the front/back dials are also difficult to feel, to find and to move... as most buttons really (contrary to the dials). I hope I will get used to them.The viewfinder is ok (this is the first EVF I have ever tried, so maybe that's why I found it just ok, and nothing more, since the only point of comparison is a FF DSLR). Feels natural with good light but it is very noisy on low light, which makes it difficult to use, almost unusable to manual focus. The WYSIWYG approach is actually nice (ie for WB, film simulation modes, difficult exposures)In the dual display the area to focus is too small and is of no help IMO (or for me at least). (future fix via firmware update?)The remote app coupled to the camera OK on 2 android devices: Google Nexus 4 (running Android 4.4.2) and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (running Android 4.3). But the remote mobile app only can be used up to 30 seconds even in bulb mode, which is a very limited and short minded implementation of remote app and won't be a workaround for the light leak issue and make the app useless for long exposure and to compensate the lacking threaded shutter button. So the remote app for me it's almost nothing more than a gimmick if it doesn't allow prolong exposure control. (future fix via firmware update?)The \"T\" mode (on shutter dial) is nicely implemented (setting shutter time with the front dial... but only from 2 to 30 seconds). Over 30 sec you should use Bulb which there is no easy/without light leak way to use. And below the 2 seconds you have the dial... but I would love that T would enable a full dial set (ie. reach from 1/4000 to 30 sec ala DSLR, for those situations in which you want to change it on the fly without taking the eye from the viewfinder... and set ISO with the back dial)Other issues:The focus point selection is a nightmare (didn't thought it was so bad when I read about it) with the D-Pad and the need to press a function button before and press OK after moving the focus point is anything but fast... and with these buttons even harder. It should be direct as the rest of the cameras in the world. And to workaround the D-Pad, it could use on future firmwares front and back wheel (if they want to keep pressing first a Fn key before being able to change focus point)Edit April 13: I have get used to the D-Pad, so now it's usable, but clearly not fast as it could have been with normal quality buttons.Another known issue and hoping it will get corrected via firmware: face detection excludes any other focus point. So if you set it to face, and it doesn't detect a face or you want to take a picture of another thing you won't be able to focus until you dig to the menu to change it. (future fix via firmware update?). Face detect can be set to a function button... why not make it a direct toggle (as with other binary options) and not Fn -> face menu -> move from off to on (with D-Pad!!!) -> OKOnly +-1EV for bracketing... not a camera to make HDR as all other Fuji X, a very old issue which I can't understand why haven't they fixed it. Maybe Fuji don't like ppl taking HDR with their camera. You still can do it manually but not handheld and taking advantage of the 8fps HL shoot mode. (future fix via firmware update? but doubt it since it has been there since Fuji X100)Slow flash sync speed 1/180. And to stay in topic although in wonderland: no Hi Speed Sync, no wireless commander/remote control of other flashes with TTL (I know this is too much for the X-T1, but it would be amazing to have a leaf shutter, faster sync speed and remote flash capabilities on future Fuji X... XPro3, X-T2?)Bad continuous focus, one of the announced improvements, at least with the 35mm f/1.4 with latest firmware 3.10 (I believe that the lens is to blame in this issue): To give an idea, I made a test in an ideal and easy focusing situation: Camera mounted on a tripod set on continuous focus on a static/contrasty object with everything on the same plane (a wall with dark/light paintings) on daylight an easy focusing subject the focus is always moving back and forth, it never stops! (it reaches focus, then GOES OUT OF FOCUS, then back again), so to have a picture in focus you should pray to the odds and it will probably be 1/3 of the times in focus, 1/3 back focus and 1/3 front focus if you are using a wide aperture and shallow DOF. It would be understandable with a moving object to be searching all the time, but not for a static subject (until it actually moves). Never seen this on a DSLR (even the most entry level) on the same conditions... when it reaches focus it stays/locks there if the object is not moving. I suspect this doesn't happen with the 56mm f/1.2, so if any one has that combo please confirm.Edit April 13: as mentioned above on the April 13 edit, this issue only happens with back button focus on manual focus mode. In continuous mode using shutter button to focus, focus does lock while in continuous focus. So it's actually a AF-L button in AF-C mode BUG (Instant AF Setting).Found another bug: the focus area size can't be modified while on manual focus (you can select the focus point, but can't move it). Why one would need this in manual focus? To use AF-L as back button focus, and for the same reason the focus point selection is already there in manual focus (but they missed add focus area size). (future fix via firmware update?)Build quality is great. Feels very good. The image quality is very good, natural colours, and it's amazing to have it in a very small package comparing it to similar quality but on DSLR bodies. It enables you to take it easily to lots of more places that a full size DSLR.The built-in RAW conversion is good (as there is still no Lightroom support, and the support for X-Trans sensors of previous Fuji X cameras is worst than other software), it would be better to have some sort of preview and not having to guess the final result to better tweak the image.The X-T1 could have been an amazing camera... but it has so many silly issues, luckily most are prone to be fixed with firmware upgrades (I hope Kaisen spirit is true), if they fix the remote app it will do it for me regarding to the light leak, since I could use that for long exposure and won't need to use gaffer tape or other nonsense on a new product!Sorry to the Fuji fans for my \"negative and sincere review\", but I really want Fuji to fix these issues and if every one omits the flaws, errors, bugs and bad usability implementations Fuji won't know that they have to fix something... clearly they haven't been able to notice these issues by their own and will continue to sell faulty cameras.I gave the 2 stars mainly for the Light leak and bad buttons (I wanted to mention though other CONS of the camera, I know I nitpick on some minor issues, but since most are fixable by firmware updates I wanted to mention them, although not basing the rating on them, nor the decision to buy it since they were known issues, like battery life), but if they fix other software/firmware issues I will probably update the rating and give more stars.PS: didn't know negative reviews were deleted on amazon, just in case had to change my amazon password.

The AF was still quick and accurate, and the ISO performance is very impressive too.I have since used the camera for portraits, landscapes, street photography and day to day shooting. It has been nothing short of incredible.

The first epic flaw is that the AF points that can track movement are limited to the 9 points in the dead center of the frame. None of those great peripheral AF points will do you any good if your subject is moving or off center. The next fatal flaw is in the shot-to-shot delay. Let me explain.. while the camera can do 8 frames per second, if you let up after a burst of shots it will be at least 1/2 to 1 full second before you can acquire focus and take another burst of shots. I can't tell you how many images I missed because of this shot-to-shot delay. The third flaw is in the EVF itself. While this is by far the best EVF I've used (bright, clear, sharp), and it does have some real advantages over an optical viewfinder, the EVF image lag is substantial when used in low light, so you better have spider-like reflexes bordering on premonition if you want to actually catch a moment in low light. The EVF performance is fine in bright light, but the lag in low light is substantial. I will try the camera again for rehearsal shooting using manual focus and peaking/magnification, but AF is how I prefer to work, so I think I'll probably end up sticking with Nikon for rehearsal shooting. Even if I do manage to nail focus using manual focus I'm going to find a way to work around the EVF lag in low light. For just about every other type of shooting that I do including studio and location portrait work this camera is a lot of fun, easy to carry and use, and delivers very flexible and clean files.

You can carry this around with you all day...something I didn't really want to do with my beloved D700. But if you think you're going to shoot all day with it, you have another thing coming. Battery life is awful, especially if you plan on reviewing your shots. Most people recommend turning off the camera in between shots to save battery life, but this just adds unnecessary time if you want a quick capture. With the battery fully charged it lasted about 2 1/2 hours. Very disappointing. If I'm traveling and out shooting, I would usually be out with the camera 12-15 hours a day. Do I really need to carry 7 batteries with me (or access to power and 2 hours to kill waiting for a battery to charge)? This is ridiculous.The kit lens (18-55) is decent, but not outstanding. I've read other reviews about how sharp the lens is, but it really doesnt compare to the D800 or the D700 with the 50mm 1.4d. On the other hand, shooting with the 14mm is a pleasure and the image quality rivals a prosumer DSLR. Autofocus is pretty fast, but I wouldn't use it for serious sports shooting. Did I mention how easy the camera is to carry around all day? Shooting RAW is possible, but editing those files takes some doing and isn't as simple as uploading RAW files into a program like Photoshop Elements 12 and having at them. On the other hand, .jpg files have generally outstanding color rendition and needed little tweaking. The EVF is indeed large and works great in good illumination, but not in low light. It still feels weird to me to look through a viewfinder and see a live video feed.Adding to the ambivalence about this camera...most major distributors/retailers like Amazon, B&H;, Adorama, are all sold out of the camera...or they get a few in and then quickly sell out. Problems with the light leak and rear buttons were supposedly fixed after the initial release, but it seems clear Fujifilm is having trouble getting the camera out and nobody is speaking on the record about what the problems are with production and distribution.If you buy this, you'll likely find good, bad and ugly.

Also, the exposure compensation dial is very stiff.ORIGINAL: It's a solid camera, well built - the quality is definitely there. It has nice looking dials and I don't actually mind the buttons, their size or responsiveness. But this thing is tiny. An inch wider and taller, and it would definitely be a keeper. Right now, my pinkie sits uncomfortably in mid air, and I find myself fishing for those great looking dials, because they are so cramped together. The exposure compensation dial, while not useful to me as I shoot manual all the time, is too stiff to rotate easily with my thumb. I also bought the 23mm f1.4 lens to go with the body, and the lens outweighs the X-T1, making it uncomfortable to hold with one hand.Don't get me wrong. I had high hopes for this body - I really wanted it to bring back the feelings of shooting manual film cameras. But it isn't. Something went wrong in designing this camera. With the battery and the lens it weighs too much for its size. I had an x100, and loved its ergonomics, but sold it because of the slow focus. I'm now thinking of just picking up a black x100s and investing the difference in accessories.I could buy a grip, but for the money I already spent on the lens and body, I don't want to invest another $250, just to make it more comfortable to use.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "need to be loved", "Author": "George Micheletti", "ReviewID": "R47IKBS32YWBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good image clarity and color.Pictures are a little different from normal picture, for the colors and the way you will operate with the camera, In order to appreciate this camera you have to study it, understand the composition of the picture you will make it, understand in  which way works, its a little different from others, you really have to love it, with the time you will appreciate it.Excellent construction, elegant, not so big.
