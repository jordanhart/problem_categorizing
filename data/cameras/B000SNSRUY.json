I was actually looking it up because I have to purchase a camera for work and was going to get this one.One of the best things about it is that despite the fact that  I take a lot of pictures of my two little ones I do not have to charge the camera very often.  Maybe once a month.My only complaint is that the video quality is low when the lighting is not good.I would recommend the camera, and despite the other reviews I am going to buy one for work.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "kko22490", "ReviewID": "RHW3Q0Z022F1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is light weight, small so it is easily carries in my pocket or purse. Takes great pictures. Video quality after transferred to the computer isn't the best but other than that I have nothing bad to say about this camera!Lost the adapter to charge it and tried to find a new one and no one carries it, so be careful to not lose it!", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sanyo Camera", "Author": "Jacob Bauer", "ReviewID": "R37I2GYLT3I0EN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an older model digital camera.

I Got one as a \"Cheep\" deploymant camera my First Tour in Iraq. Despite the dust, dirt, water, this camra came out like a champ. It has to be the toughest camera on the market of its kind. I carried it hiking when I got home, hunting, i put mine though hell and back and it stood the test of time. It made it half way though This Tour In Afghanistan before the screen finaly gave out on me. A $150 camra to last me three years thats unheard of. I bought one of those \"Shoke Proof, water Proof, do anything\" camera and it didn't make it a week over her  before craping out. Long story shot, this is an amazing camera and cant wait to get my second on for another tour of duty.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lasted 6 months Don't buy this", "Author": "P. maher \"PM 1212\"", "ReviewID": "R3PNI2GLKLF2P3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera lasted six months and then won't stay powered up.

She was responsible and careful, but by April 2009, the bottom had fallen off the camera. She gerry-rigged it with masking tape and a piece of Lego, to keep battery from falling out. I just found out about the situation and phoned Sanyo about getting the camera replaced or repaired.Did you know this camera comes with only 90-day warranty for labor and parts?Here's what Sanyo graciously offered via their 1-800 number: Sanyo will fix it IF I agree to pay $25 over the purchase price for servicing a defective camera less than one year old.

After 4 or 5 months it started shutting itself off as soon as it was in any small amount of light.  Now 8 months after we bought it will not stay on at all.  The battery is still good but the camera will not stay on.We called customer support and were told that it only has a 90 day warranty.  Since it has been longer than that it would cost us $95 plus shipping to send it in for repairs.  I asked if they were aware that was nearly the price of a new one and was told that it must our fault that it stopped working.I will never buy from this company again.  Fool me once shame on you as the old saying goes.  They will not get another chance.Spend a little more and go with another company.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good camera, bad battery", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R2NBIUA1JF7GER", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I think the overall quality of the pictures is good, but like any digital camera, in dark lighting situations, the pictures become blurry.  What I don't like is that after fully charging the battery, I left the camera on to see how long the battery would last.  It shut itself off after only 70 minutes!!!  I couldn't believe a camera with such a short battery life would be sold.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't know about the camera but don't buy Sanyo", "Author": "T.

We emailed Sanyo and got no response so called them.  They said since it was passed the 90 day warranty, they could not help us.  We were completely ripped off.  We looked in the box when it arrived and it looked like everything was there- turns out we got two of another cord instead.  I didn't know we had to go through everything piece by piece because I assumed Sanyo was a responsible company.My daughter is waiting to use her dead camera while we find a replacement charger.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Sanyo VPC-T700T 7MP Digital Camera Black", "Name": "Sanyo VPC-T700T 7MP Digital Camera Cafe Brown", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31To1-rLIVL.jpg", "ProductID": "B000SNSRUY"}}
