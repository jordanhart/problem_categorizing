{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera for Pink Panther", "Author": "Lucas", "ReviewID": "R1OZHRS9CV8B8E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, this camera is not \"red\" as described. For guys who brought this hoping for Ferrari Red, get ready to be royally mocked. It is as pink as it is shown on the picture.The TX9 comes with no memory card, but it does accept SDHC cards formatted to FAT32. With the 32GB card it the camera predicts that I can take around 6000 photos in 12M Pixels.The touchscreen is not bad looking, it is reflective like the Ipod screen which makes image looks clear but at the same time it is also more prone to glare. The touch screen is resistive, not as responsive as the capacitive screen we are used to with the iDevices. This is conform by the fact that it came with a slim plastic dog tag looking contraption with a pointy end. My girlfriend ask what it was, we were puzzled until I went to read the manual... apparently it is a stylus. Only resistive screen can use random plastic object as stylus.Besides the camera, the package came with a small docking station and a battery charger. This is a nice touch apart from the fact that is doesn't come will all the accessories for the docking station to fully function. It needs a separate AC adapter with Sony's own proprietary plugs which cost no less than $39.99 from Sony's website. Model AC-LS5. The docking station has a HDMI and a AV connector, the package only comes with the RCA cable, so again you need to buy your own HDMI cable. I ordered the Amazon Basic ones, since Best Buy loves to insanely overprice after Circuit City disappeared. With the HDMI cable, the TV out function is very nice. The picture displayed on the screen is amazingly sharp and clear in 1080i HD and you won't need to bring a computer to show your photos to your friends on HD Television. Update: I purchased the adapter, and it does not seem to  recharge the camera's battery.The basic modes of Photo on the Tx9 is Intelligent Auto Adjustment and Superior Auto Adjustment. The Intelligent Auto adjustment is the classic point and click and forget mode, the new superior mode take multiple photos at once then process it to improve picture quality. This does create noticeable clarity, but it needs around 5 second delay after each photo for processing. So this is not so useful if you have impatient friends that wants you to snap quickly.There are only a few buttoms on the camera, as most of the controls can be done on the touchscreen, the physical buttoms are there for fast access. Photo Mode, Video mode, Shutter, power, zoom and thats it. There are some primitive editing tools on the camera but they seem way too simple to be useful on a small resistive screen. It is more of a gimmick.There are 2 3D modes, the sweep panorama 3D photo which requires you to have a 3D TV to view and the Sweep multi Angle Mode which appears to changes prespective on the screen when you tilt the camera, similar to a holographic sticker. Since it depends on you to accurately perform the sweeping motion to get good photos, most of the time the 3D photo don't look correct. I also did not find a way to view the Multi Angle Mode photos outside of the camera.The photos are automatically organized onto a calender very similar to the way Nintendo DS does it. I found this to be a nice feature. The include photo software for the PC was not so useful, it decided to scan all the photo's from my other drives on the computer instead of just the camera, which made a mess of things.All the previous function are there, iSweep panorama,auto shutter on smiley face, etc, but unlike the TX5, the TX9 is not waterproof. I found it funny that Sony would called their trademark feature \"iSweep\" panorama. Without knowing the facts, if you have to guess which device the feature \"iSweep\" came from, Apple or Sony, which would you guess?All in all the strongest Pro on this camera is the point and click photo quality. It can do 1080 HD movies, but it's not the best of quality, however it is very good for it's compact size (The sound seems to be too loud when recording movies). On the down side, it doesn't include everything you want right out of the box, it only includes what you need, (minus the memory card) and buying Sony proprietary accessories isn't cheap.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "the perfect one!!", "Author": "Chow Lin", "ReviewID": "RZVU5TVXTWBBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "POS:It takes very sharp & very clear image. It can use both MS & SDHC. The LCD screen is so good because the picture display in LCD screen is the same if you display in your TV or computer. It works perfect in low light area and without flash light. Specially in the low light restaurant and sometime I need to reduce brightness because the picture came out too bright. I love the blur the background function so much because it is just like DSLR. The picture will come out so good! It worth the PRICE!!!!!!!!!CON:The battery life is not long enough to fill my 4GB SDHC. So, better buy another battery when you travel outside.PS. I bought this SONY TX9 camera after I returned Samsung Dual View TL205 12.2MP. I only use the Samsung one for 3 days and decided to return because the picture quality is so poor almost same as my old 5MP camera. I use my TX9 for a month already and still happy about it.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing piece of art", "Author": "Rami Jouda \"Chimaira\"", "ReviewID": "R2VITISZW1GJXQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i got this camera as a b-day present, but i used it a bit to try it out..and i was shocked...this cam is really amazing. what i was really impressed of was the low light pics and the 3D shots obviously...and with under water shooting as well, this cam got everything u need in one piece...the only problem i found in it was the short life of it battery which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5...the cam wont last long..so its better to get an extra battery with u if you are going out on a trip or just a regular outing because it wont last for more than 4 hours.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredibly User Friendly!!!", "Author": "Hopeful One", "ReviewID": "ROPFFFBO91BPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing \"toy\"!  I'm a novice technologically, but I do like to take good pictures. I don't have the patience or time to really play around with settings and learn/use all the functions of a many cameras, but point and click in the past just didn't have the quality for me. This one is incredibly user friendly, delivers high quality pictures and video, and is quite fun to use!  I enjoy taking action shots of kids and pets in many situations, but also love to shoot landscape (like my evolving garden through the seasons.) The options to switch to different lighting or scenes are so easy to do!!  The Panorama is pretty darn cool too!  Thank you Sony for making this great little camera!!!", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "very nice camera", "Author": "Honi2sweet", "ReviewID": "R3BHNFMAPAPL06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera for a few days so I haven't gotten to really use it.  But it is very cute, and feels well built.  I really love the touch screen. I got it in the color red but to me it looks more like a rose pink. Out door pics are very nice.  The colors are vibrant.  In doors pics looks great too.  Will update this review when I've gotten a chance to really use it.  OH and by the way the manual that comes in the box doesn't really tell you much about the use.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome quality camera!", "Author": "Keith Ross", "ReviewID": "R2FPVHG5082FX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, bought for the pink, my wife loves it!

It flashes twice for each picture so the only problem was if someone moved too quickly after the first flash because they thought it was done.  Then we had to take the picture again.  But once we alerted everyone to that, we had no problems.  Extremely happy with this purchase.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good indoor photos.", "Author": "usil2008 \"usil2008\"", "ReviewID": "R2IKJ9664A6MW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Camera produces very good pictures indoor. Low light performance is very good. Soft skin mode is very nice. Video is quite good.Cons: Outdoor picture quality is poor. Lack of White balance control in all modes except P-Mode. If you take indor pics in potrait mode, the picture tends to become yellow... you cant change the white balance.. therefore have no option. Sometimes I see distortion in picture.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buying used a bit of a mistake, but photo quality excellent", "Author": "Reader205", "ReviewID": "RPYFPD887MBPE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this used camera to replace my tx7, that I flooded in the marine housing last year. After checking out the housing, I determined the case had just popped open and was not actually defective, so wanted to get another camera that would fit the same us case. I took this camera to Saba and St Kitts trip and as far as picture quality, is great. The camera arrived quickly, looked beautiful and initially seemed to be a great purchase. I checked and found the batteries, cables, etc to be the same as my old camera and so could use my existing items in addition to what came with the camera. Now the bad part, the camera sometimes comes up with a message, must use compatible battery, even though I am using the correct battery. If you turn it on and off several times, it will come on; however, I missed a few great shots due to this problem. After using it a few days, I also found the front didn't want to slide easily. It got me through vacation, and my plan all along was to use this for a year and get a new mirrorless camera, but missing video of a shark and an eel fighting because of this camera is a loss you can't get back. Again, the video I did take was perfection and the photos and panoramic great, I think possibly it just wasn't refurbished and not quite up to par. I would  have no problem recommending a bran new version of the same camera if you're looking for something, small light weight and great for travel.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber Shot TX9", "Author": "TSwiftFan82", "ReviewID": "RINIIJG97EUU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off if your looking for a red camera this is not for you. I'm a pink lover and this camera is perfectly pink. I just got it today and i'm already in love with it. Its way better than my Kodak easy share M580. This one is quiet unlike the kodak.
