{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Versatile and Travel-Friendly", "Author": "Saradele", "ReviewID": "R1CPR7TI8UF6GQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very happy with this camera since I purchased it over a month ago. My requirements for a digital camera were resolution of at least 5 MP, compact size for travel, and some scene or manual modes. Two features sold me on this camera:  1. Compatibility with AA batteries. Most cameras this size use proprietary batteries, which means if you forget your battery recharger on a trip, you could be in trouble. With this camera, you can take out the included AA rechargeables once they run down and use regular AA batteries. While lithium batteries such as Energizer's E2 series are best, even alkalines will work in a pinch.  2. Larger LCD area. The extra inch makes a huge difference. You can tell immediately whether people blinked, and the screen is large enough that family and friends will enjoy flipping through the photos you've taken without having to squint. The larger area also makes it fun to zoom, rotate, and crop photos right in the camera.  In addition to indoor settings, I have tested the camera in the Colorado mountains, suburban Chicago, and downtown DC. The scene modes did an especially beautiful job with the mountains and lakes. I had been worried after some reviews suggested that Sony cameras make colors look washed-out and faded, but I did not experience this. My images have also been very sharp, and I can see details far in the background, such as signs in shots of city streets. I also like that you can set the camera to record images in a 3:2 ratio, so that if you are planning to make 4x6 prints, the camera saves exactly the image that will be printed. My only complaint is that the red-eye mode doesn't completely eliminate red eye in indoor shots, but I understand that this is typical for compact cameras.  Since this camera and its LCD screen could easily be damaged in a purse or backpack, I would recommend a semi-rigid carrying case such as Sony's LCMWA model.  This camera will not be right for everyone. If you're looking for a simple point-and-shoot and don't want to worry about settings, consider Canon's PowerShot S500 Elph. If your photos mostly will be indoors and redeye is your major concern, consider Nikon's Coolpix 5200. If you'll be doing a lot of telephoto zooming, consider the Pentax Optio 555 with its 5X optical zoom. But if you're looking for a versatile compact 5 MP camera in the advanced consumer/prosumer segment, then look no further than Sony's DSC-W1.", "Date": "July 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great, if you know what you are looking for", "Author": "Matthew Flower", "ReviewID": "R22L96U1QDPQAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading every online review I could find, I decided to purchase the DSC-W1 and after taking about 300 images, I am quite pleased with it.  The camera is light and small.  It has plenty of \"scene modes\" that make it easy for anyone to take a picture.  You can also take 640x480 movies with sound for as long as your memory stick pro will hold them.  (If you are using a regular memory stick, the time is limited.)  The camera is lightning fast, both in startup time and time to store an image after shooting.  There is a \"burst mode\" too that can allow multiple shots to be taken in succession, but it is too buried in the menus to be useful unless you know that good action is coming.Night photography seems to be working out quite well with this camera.  One thing I liked over similar cameras in this category is the 30 second exposure time, which is fairly high.  (Many didn't allow anything more than 10 seconds.)I ditched the included Sony batteries after reading a review somewhere and bought some Powerex 2300 batteries from MahaEnergy.  I haven't been able to go through two sets of batteries (the camera takes two AA's.) in a day's time.  In fact, one set seems to do just fine almost all of the time.The Sony supports up to 400 iso, though there is a fair amount of noise at this level.  I've been using Neat Image to clean it up though and I have no qualms about shooting at this speed as long as I'm using software to clean it up.I'm just beginning to learn how to photograph things somewhat well, and I do have a few gripes.  Most are very minor, and most would have been solved if I would have saved up the money to buy a digital SLR instead of trying to force this point and shoot to try to be a digital SLR.First, macro mode doesn't seem to let you get very close.  With my friend's Olympus Camedia, I seem to be able to all but rest my lens on the subject.  With the DSC-W1, I can't seem to get much closer than 6 inches with it getting too blurry to take a picture.  You can get some close shots, but if you are really looking at getting into macro photography, you might want to look at the Olympus, or at other cameras.Night photographers will find it irritating that there is no sort of remote cable release or remote IR release.  You can get around this problem with the self timer if necessary, but some shots you just aren't going to get.  There isn't any sort of built-in stabilization either, though I wouldn't expect any on a $400 point and shoot.  A tripod is required gear if you are going to take shots in dim light without a flash.Also, it is worth noting that the camera doesn't have a hot-shoe.  You are going to be using the built in flash.  The built-in flash seems to be okay, and I'm imagining that the average point-and-shoot photographer won't care.Overall, I'm really pleased with this camera.  If you want to be really get into the technical side of digital cameras, save up and buy a Canon Digital Rebel or some other spiffy SLR.  If you want a camera that you'll be happy to put in your pocket and take with you, the Sony is an excellent choice.", "Date": "July 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera...", "Author": "Sandeep Taneja \"Dany Boy\"", "ReviewID": "R3IPMXTTGO5ST6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this in Jan 2005 and I love this one. I have done quite some research before I bought this one. Some research sites  recomended are- PC World- Steves Digital. [...]- Imaging- Resource([...] This site has a comparometer by which you can comapare images from 2 cameras side by Side. Although thi site is little biased towards cannon as they did not use the correct settings for sony camera.But one thing was clear from my research- Cannon Camera are the best in Image quality(I'll give 5 to Cannon on image quality and 4.8 to sony. 4.2 to Kodak, 4 to Nikon. But One ditinct advantage that made my choice to sony was the Spped of the shot. Basically sony cameras take shot between .2 -.3 seconds after the button is pressed and cannon takes 1.1 - 1.3 seconds to take the shot. With my kids it is imposiible to get a posed Picture I want with cannon.Here are some of the feature comparison between Sony and Cannon(I ignored all others because of image quality)1. Image quality - Sony 4.8  - Cannon 5.0.  although at uptill 8x 10 the quality is same.2. Image clarity and details - Sony 4.7  - cannon 5.0. Cannon has the lot more details. A picture of grass shows sharp edges of grass in cannon but sony is little blurry. But at 8x10 u don't need that kind of sharpness.3. Color - Sony w1 4.9. cannon 5.0. again cannon is better but not by far. Sony P93 and P73 are worst in color but W1 does a good job and V1 and T1 are closest to true colors4. Night shots - Sony 4.9 Cannon - 4.5. Here is the difference. Sony's shots in dark lights are the best.5. Shot TIme. As I said earlier Sony is the best by 2-3 times better performance than any other camera. Besides startup time on Sony camera is about .3 seconds where as cannon is about 1.7 seconds. This is due to faster processor of Sony.6. Batery Life - I could take 170+ pictures with sony using LCD and using the review mode Extensively. For cannon I don't have the numbers but I heard it is around 100 pictures(official number is 250 for both). Besides the charger is included in Sony but not in cannon using AA bateris. This saves another 30-40 bucks7. Price - Both are same with cannons Flashs card being cheaper than sony' memory stick. But amazon.com gives 128 MB stick free which gives you 60 images at 5 MP resolution. Cannon' Battery charger for A85,95 series is going to add 40$ to your price range.8. Noise reduction - Sony is the best. no comparison in digital processing with any other brand.9. LCD Size- I've had couple of camcorders and trust me u need a bigger screen like W1 or else u miss details while reviewing, and while on a trip you try to take the best pictures only and delete the others.10. Appearance and weight. All are same weight (couple of ounces here and there) but Cannon uses 4 AA bateries which makes is little more heaview and the battery torage space required in camera makes it even more bulkier(Bigger size)  to carry.11. Lens extensions. Cannon has better acceries available but I'm not professional either:)Overall I'll say Sony is the best overall camera. Image quality compared to cannon is not the best but it is not off by far either. But If you don't care about the time taken to get the picture after button is pressed and are very hung on perfect image quality- go for cannon. But within 200-325 Price range , Sony is the best and W1 is the best in that range. It is also voted the best Point and Shoot camera by PC world(PCworld ratings are known to be best in electronics).SummarySony W1 is good at.1. Faster snap time2. Best Night shots.3. Very true colors(4.9 sony W1 and 5.0 to Cannon)4. Excelent Scene Modes.5. Decent Manual controls(You don't need them with scenic modes)6. Very good image quality.7. Lighter and better Look camera over all.Cannon is good at.1. Image quality.2. Very true colors almost perfect.Hope this helps", "Date": "January 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Had the T-1, exchanged it for the W-1", "Author": "M. Hampton \"mhamp\"", "ReviewID": "R36XPX3DRBNWHO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After two years of lackluster pictures from a 2MP Canon PowerShot S-100 (constant underexposure, short battery life).  I began looking for a digital camera replacement.  While I want to take high quality pictures, the bulk of what I take are family and travel snapshots.After endless procrastination on my part, my wife surprised me with the new Sony DSC-T1 5MP ultracompact camera.  It was very cool to play with and takes very good looking pictures with the default settings.  The T-1 is a neat camera.While I liked the DSC-T1 a lot, I had some core concerns with it that are fully addressed by it's sibling camera, the DSC-W1.  Not only does the W1 have about a half dozen more features than the T1 - it's also $100 less than the T1!I want to emphasize that both cameras take very good pictures, especially for a person that wants to take high quality snapshots - that is, pull it out and snap off a few, quickly review the shots and perhaps make some manual adjustments to optimize the pictures.What's also appealing to me about both cameras is their movie mode support.  Both cameras take credible mpeg movies, albeit without zoom support (I'm not aware of any digicam that allows you to adjust the zoom mode once the movie recording has started).  In the \"best\" movie mode (30 frames/sec), you'll consume about 1 Mb per second of recording.  However, I find that I only shoot 30 to 60 seconds of \"useful and viewable\" footage at a family gathering anyway, as well as 20 to 30 photos.  In this regard, a 256 Mb Memory Stick Pro card gets me by just fine for a day.Note that most digicams in this price range shoot 30 fps movies for only a set, limited time of 15 to 30 sec per clip, or they'll shoot longer clips at 15fps, which is pretty poor quality to me.  The T1 and W1 allow you to shoot high quality 30 fps video up to the capacity of the Memory Stick Pro card you elect to use.  This is very useful to someone like me - who never has viewed the old family videos I recorded on my video camera.  Now I load photos and videos on the PC and actually view the video clips!I am also very impressed with the on-camera editing modes of both cameras. I can shoot images at a 5 Megapixel size and easily downsize them to 3 MP, 1 MP or VGA size, as well as crop them on the camera.  With the long battery life of the W1, I do most of my editing on the camera and upload satisfactory images to the PC, lessening the need to open photo editing software.  This is really fantastic!The last general note is that some people criticize the quality of the photo software that comes with the Sonys.  I wouldn't know.  I never installed it.  I learned a long time ago that you are generally better off getting a memory card reader for $20 and uploading the images via a USB connection, then using a third party application to edit the images.The DSC-W1 has the following features that are important to me that the DSC-T1 lacks.  Cost - $100 less for the W1.Flash - only a 5 foot distance for the T1, but 12 feet for the W1.  Most of my family indoor shots are from 5 to 10 feet away.  Isn't that true for most of us?Tripod mount - I need it a few times a year for family gatherings if I'm going to be in the picture.  Also useful for obtaining the best steady shot composition for family portraits.  The T1 lacks a tripod mount.\"AA\" battery support - I can't overstate how important it is on ANY digicam to utilize common \"AA\" batteries.  No matter how well prepared I try to be, there have been occasions where I forgot to charge the proprietary batteries on my Cannon, much to my condemnation at that family gathering.  In a pinch, you can stop at a convenience store and pick up a pack of \"AA\"s to get you through the day with the W1.  Also, \"AA\" rechargable batteries and rechargers are so inexpensive right now.  The propriety battery on the T-1 lists at $60.  While the price will come down, I doubt you'll find them readily available at the convenience store.While the T1's battery life was acceptable, my perception of the W1's battery usage is that it is VERY good.  I do a tremendous amount of shooting photos and movies on the W1 in the course of a day, as well as subsequent replay and editing on the camera itself.  I still can't believe I have battery life left on the same set I started with after my typical photo and movie session with the W1...Viewfinder - Both cameras have the excellent 2.5\" LCD display.  Both cameras are well suited for taking pictures through the LCD viewfinder.  However, there are times - in bright light, in crowds, in busy/moving situations - where the optical viewfinder is useful and warranted.  The W1 has the optical viewfinder and the T1 does not.Manual exposure - The T1 and W1 both take very good snapshot pictures in a variety of lighting conditions.  However, it's nice to have the flexibility of controlling the manual exposure if you need it.Other features - While I don't need them, the W1 allows for the addition of wide and telephoto lenses and special filters with an optional lens adapter.", "Date": "July 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "All that rot about blurry pictures", "Author": "Mrs. F. J. Gigg \"bored housewife\"", "ReviewID": "R1OHLG6NRUY7KD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've just read all these complaints about blurry pictures, and felt compelled to write as it is obvious that some people just don't understand how photography works.  The W1 starts by reading the available light, just like any other camera.  When  it has done that it decides on an appropriate aperture and shutter speed.  In actual fact, it tends to choose rather larger apertures and therefore faster shutter speeds than other similar cameras.  It can't do anything else - if it set much faster shutter speeds the pictures would only be underexposed. Compare the exposure settings to those on any other camera in the same situation and you will find they are the same.  The big difference with the W1 is that, because of the large screen, you tend to hold the camera well away from your face when you shoot, inevitably causing camera shake.One solution if you want to hand-hold indoors is to increase the ISO setting to 200.  Incidentally, you are hard-pressed to take hand-held pictures OUTDOORS on any camera at ISO100 in the UK at any time of the year except in mid-summer.  Increasing the ISO to 200 doesn't seem to cause too much noise.  You can also try using the viewfinder and propping your elbows on something.I've only had this camera a few days, but it seems very sharp to me.

Howell", "ReviewID": "RITNEV2R2G70G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This our third digital camera.  Our other cameras are from Canon and Nikon.  I was leaning toward the new Canon S60 because we love our other Canon and they both would take the same CompactFlash memory cards.  This camera was going to be mine and I wanted 5MP so I could do some cropping of pictures and still keep up the quality when printing in 8 X 10 format.  The Canon S60 kept being delayed, so I started looking at alternatives.The DSCW1 seems designed to compete with the Canon S60.  Both are 5 MP, both are compact, both have manual modes which allow you to be creative with your pictures.  The Sony pulled ahead with its larger LCD display and its ability to use standard AA batteries.  The Canon relies on a propriatory lithium-ion rechargable battery.  The Sony comes with AA rechargables, but should they go dead at an inopportune moment, you can pop in any AA batteries to keep you going.I bought the Sony and have had it for almost a month.  The batteries don't seem to last quite as long as our Canon, but I picked up a couple of spare rechargables for less than $10 and just alternate them in the charger.  The DSCW1 downloads using USB2 so even though each picture is larger than 2MB each, they download FAST.  The picture quality has been great.  Indoor low light shots have a bit more blur than I would like, but they didn't come out at all with either of our other cameras.  Colors are crisp and true and prints from the pictures (on a Canon i470 printer) are excellent.One word about the included software.  Yuck.  It is useful for downloading and for doing a quick view of what you took, but beyond that it is very limited.Overall, I am very happy with my Sony DSCW1.", "Date": "June 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "great for anyone", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R21LGGVO5C5QYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was considering buying both a digital camera and camcorder since I do a lot of work in both.  Howevever, my friend got a Sony DSC T1and I found out it can take video 640x480 @ 30fps! Although I wasn't too keen on spending over $500 on that, I found out about the DSCW1.  First off, the battery life is fairly decent.  I've charged up the included pair and have been using the camera frequently with little problem in battery life, but if you do run dead on the included batteries, you can always stop by a shop and pick up more AAs which is really convenient since you don't have to rely on a proprietary format.If the 3X optical zoom isn't enough for you, you can always buy a telephoto attachment and screw it onto the lens.  Unlike the DSCT1, the W1 uses the standard memory stick size so you don't have to buy the more expensive Pro Duo sticks.  At the same time the camera can use up to 1GB memory sticks.2.5\" LCD is very nice but not a neccesity.5MP gives great pictures and when scaled down makes an even nicer print.  Don't bother with the included software.  If u run windows XP the  camera is recognized as a disk drive and you can access pictures immediately after plugging camera into USB.  If you do get this camera, definitely get a Memory Stick Pro 256MB.  The 32MB stick lets you take maybe 12 or 13 pictures at max res and 23 pictures @ 3MP.

I've taken about 5,000 photos.  I'm very happy with the performance of this camera.I upgraded from my old Olympus C-700-UZ, as a result of my wife's complaints that it didn't fit in the diaper bag.  The Sony is definitely a convienient size.Negatives:--Memory Stick: not my favorite media, and not found in anything not made by Sony.  For about $50 at Costco, I got a 256MB card which holds 100 pictures.  A week later I got a second.  My HP printer's built-in card reader won't read the Pro version of the memory stick, which means anything bigger than 64MB.  I had to buy yet another card reader.--Poor flash range.  The old Olympus did a better job with the flash at about 10', while the Sony generally comes out a bit dark there.--Bundeled software.  It is darn near useless.  It is the only place I can view the 16-frame burst mode pictures.Positives:--AA batteris.  Not rechargable, but when you can easily get 1000 pictures off one pair of Energizer E2 Photo Lithiums ($5), why bother with a rechargable that runs out after a hundred or so?  This is with the screen on all the time, and lots of flash photos.  The secret to getting longer battery life: use the card reader to erase the pictures, not the camera (erasing flash memory uses lots of juice).--5MP sharp pictures.  Most pictures are of my son and the things he does, so I probably couldn't tell you if there was any subpixel abberations or thermal noise affects, but my son is pretty darn cute in every picture.--Good Size.  Fits comfortably in the hand.  Sony's smaller twin to this just felt too thin to be comfortable.--Durable.  I've thwacked it a couple times and it's shown no problems.--Video.  Nice video capabilities.  Does a better job than the Olympus.  Will not allow changing zoom during a movie, and sometimes it will hunt around looking for focus at odd times during a recording.--Cool 16-frame burst mode.  Takes 16 smaller pictures (640x480?) in under a second, and puts them together in one frame as a 4x4 array.

I finally chose the Sony over the Cannon Powershot S500 (which I also consider to be an excellent choice). The reason I chose the Sony was:1) Carl Zeiss optics. I own a Contax RTSII SLR that use Zeiss optics, and consider them to be the best in the industry; much better than Nikon, and my shots are only limited by my ability to compose them, not the optics of the camera. The Sony uses a Zeiss certified lens, though from what I've read it is not manufactgured by Zeiss in Germany. I've found it to be an excellent performer thus far.2) Manual options. Though not as exhaustive as the Sony V1, it certainly offers all of the options that I forsee needing.3) Form factor. You can't take the once-in-a-lifetime shot if you're not carrying a camera, and the Sony is small enough to carry with you at all times, and catch that National Geographic quality photograph.4) Large screen & viewfinder. While the Sony T1 offers a large TFT display, it does not provide a viewfinder. The W1 offers both ; the viewfinder for precise composition, and the display for easy shooting. Best of both worlds.Downsides:1)Anemic flash - there is no such thing as a good flash that is built into a camera. You'll need to purchase a remote flash to get reasonable performance for any portrait photography (this applies to every digital camera I've seen thus far). 2) Average softwareI've been taking photos for thirty-plus years, and have never found a digital camera to be a reasonable replacement for my Contax, Yashica T4 Super P&S, or my 50's vintage Nikon Rangefinder. The Sony W1 is the first camera that I consider likely to replace film.

I'm using it now for more then a month and I tested every mode I could and I'm more then satisfied. If you ask me, the camera works the best when you shoot in AUTO mode. That's my opinion. Sometimes even when you take night shots. Trust me, I live in Las Vegas so I have experience believe me. Pictures are also great even when you shoot with 1MP. The movies are great specialy if you have MS Pro like I do (256MB) when you can shoot in 640FINE mode. What else to say.And yeah, you guys who are complaining about the blurry pictures. First of all read the manual on how to take the pictures specialy for the night shoots. During the night shoots shuter speed is reduced so if you shake the camera of course you will get the blurry pictures. Did you ever heard about the tripod?!?I think this is also the only digital camera of it's size that you can actualy upgrade with extra lenses. That's simply amazing!What's also amazing and it simply takes your breath away is 2,5\" screen. It's just awesome. That was just one of the reasons why I bought this camera in the first place.Boot time: 1.6 seconds. Try to beat that!The design is great even though, they could made it little bit thinner (like Casio Exilim series). But that is because of Ni-MH batteries I supose.Speaking of batteries, they will serve you for a long long time. Sony says 340 shots, but personaly I think it's little bit less (always is) but anyway, I recomend buying an extra pair of Sony rechargeble batteries (they are only $9!!! comparing to Lithium batteries for other digital cameras which are 3-4 times more expensive).What else. I bought MS Pro 256MB for $67 (I found it on amazon.com, it was the cheapest deal I could find) and I don't recomend nothing less 'couse those 5MP pics need a lot of room on the stick (The Magic Stick ;).I also purchased a case for $20 (amazon.com) which is in stores for $30. That was a good deal too.Overal, this camera rules. And yeah, price is now reduced to $319 with free shipping. I bought it over newegg.com for $350 a month ago, they have great ratings and I personaly have great experience with them, so check them out.I hope this review helped.Specialy for you guys who are still thinking \"should I buy it or not?!\"SONY RULES!!!End.Problems (If you can call it a problem)On my opinion only the charger. You need aproximetly 6 hours to charge the batteries with the charger that comes in the box with the camera. So, my choise was buying an extra pair of batteries so I don't need to wait for so long.Or, you can buy a faster Sony charger that charges batteries for around 2-2.5 hours, but that's more expensive option.I think extra pair of batteries is better choise.", "Date": "September 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Compact, sturdy, and high quality... worth it!", "Author": "Patrick Taillon", "ReviewID": "R1X7DK0RP0DZUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a couple months I debated between the DSC-T1 and the DSC-W1. I ended up purchasing the W1 after seeing it in a few different stores, on display. Comparing the T1 and the W1 side by side gave me a much better perspective on both products. Here are the reasons for my purchasing the DSC-W1:The W1 was more sturdy, and easier to stabalize in my hands, allowing me to keep the camera steady longer for low light and action photographs. Because of this absolutely none of my pictures have come out blurry. (others complaining about blurry pics may have a multitude of factors to blame... it's all about reading the manual, becoming familiar with all of your camera's functions, and making the proper adjustments).The W1 is compact enough for me to carry everywhere, whether it is in my pocket, my backpack, or it's own carrying case (I purchased a small carrying case for it, to protect the LCD screen). I also used one of my screen protectors for my PDA for added screen protection.The 5.1 MP is a nice feature to have. Sure, most people can get by with 3.0 or 4.0 MPs if they're just looking for 4 x 6 - 5 x 7 prints, and to post their shots online. But having th 5.1 MP feature allows me the versatility to enlarge prints to 8 x 10 if I wish. It's a nice feature to have, especially if I know that if I ever want to enlarge more, I can.The W1 also has a few different modes tht have come in quite handy. Not only is there an auto-everything mode, but you can switch the camera to Manual, and make any/all adjustments that you need to make. It also has a \"semi-auto everything\" mode that allows you to make slight adjustments. The other mode presets work wonderfully for night shots, night portraits, beach scenes, landscapes, and soft portraits.Other nice features:- The movie mode is a nice feature to have as well, even though I personally don't use it often. The quality is very good, and as long as you have memory you can record.- The W1 has a tripod mount.- No proprietory battery is needed... uses either rechargeable AA or regular AA batteries.- Uses standard Media Stick or Media Stick Pro (unlike the DSC-T1 which uses the more expensive Media Stick Duo)This is a great camera, and worth the money too. Some suggestions if/when you buy:1.) Make sure you go somewhere to handle the camera in person before buying online. It makes a difference to be able to see the actual product first. And be sure to ask questions if you have them.2.) Puchase expanded memory. I recommend a 256 Media Stick Pro at minimum.3.) Puchase a case for protection.

But considering features and value, the Sony W1 is unquestionably one of the best deals out there. Among its most useful features for me:- The large. bright, 2,5 inch LCD screen is a real selling point -- the largest, brightest, and most responsive you'll find. (Most of the competitors offer postage stamp-sized screens with grainy detail,)- Photos are sharp, bright, and well-colored. I've had good results in bright and dark environments. While some have complained about \"blurriness\" or other visual faults, you'll find that most are remedied by a careful read of the camera manual. Over 100 pages, it offers solutions to the more common digital imaging problems.- The W1 is acceptably small. Somewhat smaller than a pack of cigarettes, this will just fit a short pocket. It's recommended, however, that you invest in a case -- if only to protect the LCD screen from damage.- Multiple modes, common to digitals in this range, offer a bit of flexibility to the more creative photorapher.- The outstanding JPEG movie mode (with monaural sound) is second only to the Canon S1 IS in shoothness and detail, though it also offers a nifty email mode. It's like having a Super-8 camera (assuming you've invested in a 256 or 512MB memory stick).There are a few things would have wanted:- The W1 does not come with a case, although you can purchase a an attractive, economical CaseLogic DC43 case for under $7.00 -- considerably less expensive than Sony's.- Image stabilitzation would have been nice for movies and deep-zoom shots. Deep zoom is best suited for outdoors.- The USB door is rubber, not polycarbonate or metal. You're going to be using this door a lot for USB transfers, and it could be sturdier.- Sony's memory sticks are proprietary (though SanDisk and Lexar offers cheaper, better substitutes). You'll want a \"Pro\" stick. The enclosed 32MB stick will handle maybe 12 high-res shots. A 512MB stick should suffice for most users. and should cost no more than $80.I continue to enjoy using the W1, though I continue to use an SLR for more challenging shots.

You take a picture and pass it around.  People love looking at pictures on the camera.  You can't get that same effect with most digital cameras today.I bought the W1 because it also has a 2.5\" LCD screen, but the camera itself is 1/4 the size.  And this screen is actually much clearer than on my previous camera or on the Sony V1 (which this camera replaced).  The picture quality of the photos is decent.  (I'm no expert.)  Startup is super fast.  There's no lens cover, which is convenient.  And it uses rechargeable AA batteries.  I bought an extra pair for $10.  It's also got an optical viewfinder so you can turn off the screen to save power while you're taking photos.A lot of usability improvements - They finally replaced the directional pad with buttons; the center used to be difficult to press.  The on-screen menus are easier to read.  A cool new feature is that when you select the camera mode by rotating the dial, it temporarily displays the icons rotating on the screen, so that you don't have to look at the top of the camera.And even the manual is much improved.The flash seems a bit small, but I haven't tested it out fully yet.  My only real complaint is that it doesn't come with an AC adapter to directly recharge the camera.  A cradle would be nice too.

I like that options for night, backlit, candlelit, etc. photos are on the top-rotating dial instead of under the setup menu as in previous Sony cameras.4.  Memory - The 32 MB that it comes with doesn't hold a whole lot.  I advise getting more memory.  It's worth it.5.  Batteries - Convienient AA size, which is bulkier than some other digital cameras.  If worse comes to worse, you can use a set of regular batteries.6.  Software - It has a nice tutorial on how to use your camera.

I also picked up the DSCW1 soft carrying case (a must have) and a SanDisk 256mb memory stick (which was about half the price of Sony's memory stick).

Olympus. I had one major desire: speed.  And I'm not just talking about start-up time, which is important but not sufficient.  I wanted very little shutter-lag, and quick shot-to-shot performance.  I was tired of squeezing off shots of my kids' sides and backs because of a long lag-- I wanted to see their faces!Well, unlike many others I researched, and several others I tried, this one delivers.  Start-up time is very brisk (maybe 2 seconds), but what's truly impressive is the near-instantaneous response from the auto-focus and shutter.  When you're outside and not using a flash, it's one- or two-tenths of a second... not quite SLR performance, I guess, but more than two or three times as fast as what had been so frustrating. Inside, if the camera needs to use its automatic focus light to get an auto-focus reading, it takes a bit longer-- maybe three- or four-tenths of a second... still significantly faster than what you're probably used to if you're using another digital camera.  And if you're into it, you can tweak this a bit: you can turn \"continuous auto-focus\" on, which shaves off a bit more time at the expense of some battery life, or you can use a programmable mode that turns off auto-focus altogether.  Plus it's got two burst modes, including one that catures 16 VGA shots in a second.  All in all, this baby nails the speed need.There's more good news.  The camera feels very well-made, and for me, it's got just the right heft: I've messed with slightly smaller and lighter cameras that don't feel right because they're so light.  It uses rechargeable AA batteries-- very handy.  Its LCD screen will make you cry it's so good.  (Of course, it'll also suck your batteries dry like a Hummer chugs gas.)  And it's got enough tweakability and expandability to let you grow: it accepts a telephoto lens, for instance, and allows for a remote flash.What's not to like?  Not much.  My pictures have a bit more red-eye than I'd like... I can't tell if it's more prevalant than with my Olympus, or whether I just notice it more becaue I'm taking more pictures, or whether it's jsut a fact of life with small cameras.  Some people aren't fans of the memory stick system... I felt this way, in fact, before pricing it out and realizing they cost about the same as SD cards, and there are plenty of third-party manufacturers and readers for it.  Just be sure you get a 256MB Memory Stick Pro-- should cost you about $65 at Amazon-- and make sure your card reader accepts the Pro kind.  And the battery life won't win any awards (though using the viewfinder helps).So in all, I'm a huge fan: it has speed to spare, has a few extra goodies to boot, and is quite reasonably priced for a 5MP camera.

With a flash (unless it's slow sync--and that doesn't work well either) your photos may have well be taken in some generic studio.For everyone else this camera will invariably prove itself to be  inept.For some reason it's highly insensitive to light and will set very slow shutter speeds for any photo that is not abundantly well lit. Even indoor pics with ample natural window light are nearly impossible to capture with this Sony. It continually blinks a warning \"hand\" on the large LCD to let you know that you will not be able to hold it still enough and most of the time you cannot hold it still enough.

As far as what one reviewer said about it being blurry when you take close-ups or pet portraits (I take a ton of pictures of my dog), and the thing is, what you have to do is push the left arrow key and the little tulip sign comes up on the bottom of the LCD screen, and then you tap the picture-taking button lightly until the green focus light comes on and it then focuses extremely well and very distinctly on the object you are shooting (a portarit or whatever you are focusing on).Whenever I make a big purchase i do a TON of research, and I read every review I could google about this camera and was very impressed with everything reviewers had to say and agree completely w/99% of what they said (always have to leave 1% for any discrepencies).  The only thing I was originally skeptical about was the battery life since it uses NIMH rechargables or double AA, but my NIMH ones that the camera comes with lasted a long time, only had to charge once during my whole vacation, and I wanted to try the new Energizer lithium double AA's - (created especially for digitals) and they are AWESOME. I have used my camera over and over again since I bought the new lithium double AA's and have not had to change them once, and there is no negative usage shown on the battery indicator on the camera.

This is serious problem in cameras I have borrowed; you miss the shot because it takes too long to process.- Huge and easily viewable screen on the back of the camera.  Even in the normal brightness mode, you can still see it in direct sunlight; you can make even brighter (or darker) if you want, or turn off the viewing screen.- Impressive array of configurable options.- Menu navigation that is quite well designed in my opinion, the only place I've gotten mixed up is that there are 2 main sets of menus and sometimes it can be confusing as to which options are in which set.- Really well laid out buttons and dial.  Superb ergonomic design.- Beautiful to look at.  Has an admirable precision in fit and finish.  The buttons and the dial have a very solid feel to them, with just the right amount of resistance.- A impressive range of features if you are willing to spend the time to learn how to use them, including manual exposure modes, preset focus limits, numerous photography modes (i.e. night, landscape, etc.- The lens is well protected and slightly recessed; you have to be quite a klutz to touch or damage it.- A nice size; roughly the size of pack of cigarettes though much heavier of course. About 9 oz. with batteries.- The optical viewfinder has good eye relief; i.e. you can see  the whole viewfinder even with glasses.  However, I rarely use the viewfinder but use the screen on the back to frame the images.- The body is brushed aluminum not plastic.  I don't know if this helps but it make the camera much prettier, and makes it feel more solid.- Multi-zone focusing; the camera even displays the focus zones on the screen.  I've haven't had an out-of-focus shot yet.- Multi-zone meteriing which does a great job.- Nice optics and resolving power (and I'm used to a pretty high standard: fixed-focal length interchangable Nikon lenses).Gripes:- The lack of case; you definitely need one, and probably a semi-rigid one as the viewing screen could be easily damaged.- The measily 32MB memory card.  You'll need something bigger.  I bought a SanDisk 256MB Memory Stick Pro, it works fine.- It's easy to turn on the close-up mode, then forget to turn it off.  Fortunately, long-distance pictures taken with the close-up mode on seem to look OK anyway.- The optical viewfinder shows a somewhat miniscule image, but I use the screen on the back of the camera 99% of the time anyway.- The aluminum body makes the camera vulnerable to dings.- You can't rapid fire photos because it takes a second or so to process and store the image.  If you want something for sports photography this probably isn't it--you probably need a 35mm film or digital camera.

This camera's noise filtering causes pictures to look 'soft' or in my interpretation - slightly out of focus.In outdoor scenery shots it isn't very noticeable - the 5MP is able to give you a lot of detail especially in the area of the picture that is not your main subject (background trees, roofs, etc).  However in portraits, or pictures of pets, the problem is VERY apparent.Going from a 1MP to a 2MP camera, the 2MP camera \"wow'd\" me.  Going to this 5.1MP camera, I look at the pictures and say \"eh?\".I've tried what other people have suggested - set camera to manual or programmed mode, turned up sharpness, turned down contrast, set autofocus to center only - yet still pets, portraitshots are smooth.  Facial features are ever so slightly blurred -  detail is lost in the hair, contrast around the nose and eyes.  It's like looking at a flat/matted picture!Do I think I got a bad one?  No.  There have been a few other owners on some of the digital camera discussion forums that at first said \"No way, this camera is great!\" only to come back later and say \"Wait, I spoke too soon, there is an issue\".Then there is the poor flash capabilities - not very powerful. Yes, a lot of compact digital cameras suffer from this but this camera seems especially bad.  There's a user that took a bunch of indoor photos at their son's birthday part and every one was blurry - not one was printable!  The camera is physically gorgeous.  The LCD is HUGE and very nice and clear!  The camera is very responsive, fast, WELL built, and a nice size, but the pictures don't live up to the \"Carl Zeiss, 5.1MP\" advertising!Don't be fooled by reviews that take pictures of posters and resolution charts - this camera does great with those items.  Take a look at their portrait shots of live people and zoom in on the facial features.  Compare that with another camera and you'll see the difference.  Again, far away shots of scenery looks great.

The buttons are sturdy enough not to be accidently pressed down and the pictures turn out great.

As I was soon to become a first time Grandmother I decided I needed a digital camera to E mail those pictures around the world. I bought this camera on a Monday & lo & behold my new Grandson arrived on Thursday of that week. Obviously I did not have much experience with this camera at all. The pictures came out beautiful. It is so fast to start up & very fast in between shots. I love how easy it is to look back at your last shot. With the birth of a baby you don't have a lot of time to reshoot if you didn't get the shot. We have taken quite a few with no flash when the baby is awake & found it very steady & the pictures came out great. I love the ease of changing the picture after you've taken it right on the camera to make it a close up. Plus, it keeps the original picture you took. I was nervous about transferring them to my PC. It was my first attempt and I was afraid of losing such priceless pictures. With windows XP all I did was plug the cable into the camera & into the PC & it was done in a couple of minutes. No software needed! I can't say how impressed I am with this camera. I also love the larger viewing screen. For an older person it's a fantasic feature. The fact that you can use 2AA batteries in a pinch instead of rechargables is also a plus. I'm glad I spent a month researching different digital cameras. I believe I made a great choice. I hope my review might save some one else all that time. Also worth mentioning is the rechargable batteries were used for 16 hours the day the baby was born. 114 pictures (on a 256 memory stick) and with family members flipping through the pictures taken so far, all day long.

I am very impressed with image quality. Colors are bright, contrasty and accurate. Noise is suppressed very well, although if you look closely it is actually overdone a bit (sometimes washing out fine details), but it is not a major negative feature. The Zeiss lens is razor sharp (as you would expect), and 5 megapixels allows me to read tiny details in my pictures like street signs. Battery life is surprisingly good. I could probably fill up my 256 Megabyte card easily on High Quality mode with battery life to spare. Easy to use point and shoot mode, as well as manual modes. The reviewer below:  Sandeep Taneja \"Dany Boy\" has hit it right on the head. His review is very accurate, read it! This guy did his homework.The camera's fast snap time cannot be stated enough. It doesn't just snap pictures quickly, even the time taken to \"Power up\" is very fast (the lens comes out very quickly). Hence, I can \"Power on\" and take a shot very quickly (probably under 2 seconds although I have never officially \"timed it\"). Write times to the card is fast as well. This camera was purchased to take shots of my 1 yr old niece and it has not disappointed!One of my concerns with this camera (as with almost all digicams) was the camera's ability to shoot in low light conditions. Even digicams such as Nikon's vaunted Coolpix 5000 have difficulty shooting under these situations. Some of my pix have come out darker than I would have liked, however a manual switch to ISO 400 (and/or increase of EV to +1.5) has done the trick on many occasion.I love this camera's movie mode! There is so much video can tell you that a picture cannot. I enjoy taking videos of my 1 yr old niece as well as making videos of places I visit.Camera is small and pocketable, although I am starting to accumulate little dings in the plastic and they are starting to look noticeable. Suffice the say, the body construction is not great. In fact, it is a little cheap.Some people have complained about having difficulty focusing. You should know that this camera has optional Multi Focus AF (multiple focus points - auto focus), multi metering, spot metering, Center Focus AF, .5m, 1.0m, 3.0m, and infinity focus options. If you know which option your camera is set at, then you can use this information to properly setup your shot. If not, don't be surprised if your subject is dead center in the screen and you are getting a clear background and a fuzzy subject.Other positives: I really do enjoy playback on the 2.5\" screen. It is a high res screen and although I use it to a minimum when shooting (to conserve batteries), it is nice for playback.Ergonomics are good. The firing button is placed on the top of the camera and depressing the shutter half way (to set the metering mode) is easy to do and it is not too easy to accidentally press it all the way.Summary:What stands out to me about this camera is the excellent quality of pictures, ease of use, super fast operation times, and video mode.

After 5 years and thousands of pictures, this Sony still works like new.  No problem no nothing at all.  I've upgraded to a Nikon D40 but I am still using the Sony very often. The D40 is just too big and heavy.  The picture from the Sony is still very good. The color from the Sony is very good. Just make sure you have the flash turned on at all time and condition, the picture will come out sharp and clean.  One big problem I have noticed over the years is that the picture from the Sony (when set to 5.1MP) is not 3:2  This is a big problem when I take the memory card to print at Costco. Costco chop the pictures from the top and bottom because the pictures are square at 5.1MP; not 3:2.  If you are planning to print the pictures, make sure you set the Sony to \"3:2\"; not \"5.1MP\".I have been playing with this camera for 2 days.The speed is amazing. I can keep shooting and shooting with very fast shutter speed.  I turn the camera on and I can take picture right away. There is virtually no waiting from shoot to shoot.The camera is small but has a nice weight; and have a pretty good grip.It is very easy to learn and use.Compared the picture quality with my 3.1M Kodak, the DSC-W1 takes much better picture. My Kodak is pretty good but this Sony is awesome!And they cost the same.  The store has $40 off with this Sony. What a deal.The AE Illuminator is great.  I took a picture of my flower out side in complete darkness. The picture came out sharp and bright.But taking picture in door is very tricky. If the flash doesn't come on when taking picture in door, the picture is very fuzzy most of the time even the room has enough light (enough light to tell the camera not to use the flash).  But if I force the flash to turn on (even the room is bright enough), the picture comes out very sharp.  Never has this problem with my Kodak.  My Kodak can take very good picture in any condition except where it is very dark.May be the len doesn't let enough light to pass through.  Basically, in any condition (in door or out door; from dusk to dawn), if the flash doesn't come on, the pictures are usually dark and fuzzy.2 AA Alkaline lasts about 30 minutes. So, make sure you have enough batteries with you.  The rechargable that comes with the camera lasts a whole lot longer.  Sony gives me 20% discount after I register the camera in their website.  So, I will be getting the starter kit that comes with extra batteries.Using Memory Stick doesn't bother me since there is always something new every year.  And copying pictures to my computer is very fast.  I can just copy the pictures to my Compact Flash memory and take the CF to the store for the prints.The only bad thing is the software. It has no usefull feature but to let you copy and view the pictures from the camera. I can easily copy the pictures to my computer without the software since XP sees the camera as a disk drive; or you can set the USB mode to on-line camera mode (PTP) and XP sees it as a camera.Overall, one of the best point-and-shoot camera.

This is my first experience with a digital camera, and although I will be looking for a light SLR at some point, this camera has exceeded my expectations for a point and shoot.  I wanted to address two complaints that I see in other reviews. The first is that the picture isn't sharp, I compared some of my images with those from my wife's 4 Mpixel Olympus, shooting the same subject at the same time. I think the images from the Sony are sharper. The second complaint in another review is that the macro doesn't focus close enough. I get clear photos to around 2 1/2 inches as the specs promise. You need to use spot focusing and be very careful that it focuses on what you want to be clear. I think that an SLR is indicated if you are looking for better close-ups.  The one thing I'm disappointed in is very high contrast scenes. I don't know if this is peculiar to this camera or goes with digital photography. I take lots of pictures in the Colorado Rockies, and I get excessive contrast on the scenes with the dark green forests in the foreground and snow covered peaks in the background.

It does particularly well with high color and high contrast situations, and I have found it to be very nice for photographing scenery and sunsets.  Indoor pictures are fine but not exceptional - but many of mine are taken under fluorescent lights, so perhaps I'm not a good judge of that.  I like the long-exposure night settings.Images taken at night with a flash haven't been great; they're very washed out and a few times the flash didn't reach far enough, but I'm not a fan of using a flash anyway, so that doesn't bother me.  The videos aren't great either; they look good on the lcd, but are terribly pixilated if they get enlarged at all.  However, I bought it as a camera, not a video camera, and it's nice to have video capability if you want to give an impression of how noisy and crazy something is.My one complaint about the design is that the wheel to change settings can be a little over-sensitive and occasionally turns when I'm just trying to take a picture.  This hasn't been a major problem; it's accidentally switched to the long-exposure setting perhaps 5 times in the 15 hundred pictures I've taken with it.  This is annoying when it happens, but it wasn't a huge deal any of the times.In terms of camera construction, I'm very impressed.  The camera slipped out of my hands while I was taking a picture and dropped about 4.5 feet to a concrete sidewalk.  Both the batteries and the memory card flew out, and I was sure that I had killed it, but it turned back on again when I put the pieces back, and as far as I can tell it still works just fine.  The only noticeable damage is that the plastic catch on the battery slot broke, so that while it still closes and holds itself shut, the lid of the battery case no longer lies flush with the body of the camera.I've been using NiMh batteries; they generally last me for at least 300 pictures if I'm not using the video or the long-exposure features.As I said, I've been very happy with it.  It has some flaws, but they don't bother me too much, and it's a good-but-not-horribly-expensive camera for an amateur photographer like me.", "Date": "October 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "No blurry or dark pictues indoors - here's how", "Author": "D.

It's small, easy to use and has a huge LCD screen that works in all lighting.  I bought it the day before my caribbean vacation, along with a 512 card.  In the month that I had it, I have taken well over 1,000 shots. With that in mind, I can definitively report that the image colors are brilliant, almost better than life and the composition of the images are exactly what I thought that I was taking. That's the good news.  The bad news is that that vast majority of my shots are slightly blurry and even the perfectly focussed images are soft to the point that it misses the minute details.  Not so much so that you would notice as you are running a slideshow on your monitor, but if you examine each photo, you realize that something is not-quite-perfect.  I also have an olympus and a nikon digital and I compared the images against the images of the other cameras.  The nikon/olympus shots are SHARP and CLEAR, right down to the smallest detail. The Sony shots are NOT. I read reviews of the Sony on digital photography sites and several people mentioned that you should use the P mode, set the contract to -1 and the sharpness to +1.  I did and it certainly helped. But in the final analysis, the images suffer from a softness that does not contain the same details as the other cameras.  Looking at individual portraits, the crispnesss of the other images are missing and in its place is a pretty facsimile of the real thing.  Some people may actually like this; it does seem to soften wrinkles and age-lines (kind of like botox without the injections).  But to me, real life has to be warts-and-all and this camera is not capable of handling it.  One final word on the blurriness.  If you have the camera, try taking three shots.  The first at full wide angle, the second zooming half way and the third with the full zoom.  You will undoubtedly notice that the full zoom shots are never as good as the full wide shots.

So I purchased the camera and a SanDisk 1GB Memory Stick Pro to hold lots of pictures and video.  We went out on a beautiful fall day to test it out. What a disappointment! Out of more than 100 pictures there were about 10 keepers...and even those weren't great. The brilliant fall leaves looked faded and the beautiful blue sky looked washed out and white in most pictures. The video quality was the biggest disappointment. In regular 640x480 mode the video kept going in and out of focus so nothing was worth keeping. In 640x480 fine mode the video quality was only slightly better than my Canon's 320x240 video and nowhere near the quality of the Canon SD100 640x480 video. So I sent the camera back for a refund.

It has 5 megapixels which means it has 5 million pixels in this tiny device. 3x Optical Zoom isn't too good but most digtal camera providers make this zoom standard. It has a 2.5\" screen which is perfect for viewing and if you compare that with a 1.5\" you can really see the difference. I like the silver color on this camera and I think it looks sleek. It takes memory stick which is somewhat of a hassle to get but I like that it's really small. I would recommend 1GB Memory Stick rather than te 32MB it comes with. You can really take this on your vacation and take beautiful images and when you come home you can edit them, burn them onto a disk or e-mail them to friends and family.

The picture quality was excellent except in a very few cases - indoor shots mainly. Outdoor shots in daylight was outstanding. But if you want to take indoor shots, where the subject is a little farther off, you need to adjust the lighthing and stuff -the flash has a moderate working range of about 11 ft.Close-up shots are very good too. The pictures very sharp and of excellent quality.This camera has one of the best menu/navigation buttons and is very user-friendly.

Marinescu", "ReviewID": "R3S4S10KO87P0D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can only compare this camera with my previous one, a 3.2 MP Olympus D-550. Some of the reviewers on this web site are correct: there are some major differences in the ways you take pictures, so reading the manual does help with that. With Olympus, a press of the button will take the picture, but it may take a couple of seconds until the picture is actually taken. With this Sony camera, you have to semi-press the button and then wait for the Auto-Focus to find the best spot, then press fully the button and take the picture. If you fully press the button from the beginning, then the picture will almost always be blurry. This different concept will get most of the people that did not have this type of camera before.The problem is that even after following the right procedure, this camera still takes blurry pictures. Especially indoors, more than 50% of the pictures are blurry. Outside, the percentage drops a bit, but this camera is still nowhere close to the Olympus. D-550 takes very clear and sharp pictures. I usually had maybe 2 blurry pictures every 100 or so. With the Sony though, the percentage is unacceptably higher.You would think technology moves ahead - but maybe not with Sony.I really wanted to like this camera - it has all the features I want. But why bother about them, if its main purpose is denied: it cannot take clear pictures! I can only assume the positive reviews come from people that never owned another digital camera before or settle too easy. This camera is the worst digital camera I have ever used.Final conclusion: stay away from it. If you want to try it, make sure you can return it easily, case you will not like it. Take the positive reviews with a grain of salt - the manual can only slightly improve the results, but you will still get a high percentage of blurred photos, especially indoors.", "Date": "September 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Should have been recalled", "Author": "bunnyrabbit4", "ReviewID": "R3VMRZJQVNYQSS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATEFirst off, since many of you who are reading this review may already own this camera, let me say that if your camera keeps shutting down and not allowing any pictures to be taken, use the 3 pixel setting. It may allow you to get at least some use out of the camera. After reading numerous reviews on this unit and comparing the performance of mine to that of a friend who also has it, I have to say that SONY made a slew of defective cameras and this should have been a recall. Some cameras seem to work fine, thus the good reviews. Others, and there are many many of these, shut down unexpectedly, won't work well on the 5 mega pixel setting, take terrible pictures (especially in low light) and generally aren't worth the money you paid for them. Sony's quality keeps going down and since they know they aren't providing the quality, they have charged their tech support with running \"interference\". In other words they do everything they can to make if your problem. This is the second Sony product that failed on me this year and I have been a loyal Sony fan for years. But after having this and their double layer DVD player also die in one year, I'm changing brands. Whatever you do don't buy this white elephant used. You are very likely to get one of the bad ones.When I got this camera, and after I had used it for a few days it started turning itself off. I thought that it was supposed to do that if I failed to take a picture for more than a few minutes. What I soon learned was that it was running low on battery power and needed to be off most of the time or you would go through batteries like butter. Even when the camera is off and loaded with new cells it will quickly deplete itself. So you have to turn the thing off if you aren't about to shoot...this makes catching that special shot almost impossible, especially since when you do turn it on you then have to wait and wait and wait for the shutter to snap.  Forget anything with low light. I used this camera recently to photograph my elderly relatives at a family reunion. They stood still really well, but the slightest head turn resulted in a ruined shot.

(Isn't picture quality the whole point of a camera?)I received this camera as a gift.  It was supposed to replace my old slow digital camera (made by HP).  I really wanted to like this camera because it was a gift and who wants to deal with a return?  Out of the box, I could not take a clear photo with the Sony.  I decided that it must be \"user error\" and read the manual and watched the software tutorial.  My images still were blurry.  I decided to sit the camera on a table and try to take a picture that way - the center was in focus, but the edges of the picture were not.  After playing with it for awhile it's about 50/50 whether or not I'm going to get a somewhat clear picture - I don't want to trust my memories to a 50% chance of a crystal clear picture!  If this camera were only 100$, I wouldn't complain and I would live with it, but it retails for over 300$ and is 5MP, the image SHOULD be sharp.  By digital STILL camera- I think Sony means both the object being photographed and the photographer need to be perfectly still.If you're only going to be taking still pictures a tripod and photo cropping software would help with the blurry spots.  As far as a camera to take pictures of the family - my recommedation is to pass on this one!I gave this camera 2 stars because of the nice features on the camera (the attempt by Sony was there).

We took around 5 gigs worth of pics and video of Fiji and New Zealand. For the most part, I was pleased with the photo and movie quality though I pretty much found that I got very little extra detail between 3 meg and 5 meg pics and so I pretty much stopped using the 5 meg setting. Color saturation seemed fine. Image sharpness was good.Video quality was good except that, there's no zoom while filming, you had to hold the camera with both hands and move it slowly to avoid choppiness, occasional focus problems when moving between near and far objects.However, I cannot recommand this camera to anyone because after two 4 foot falls, it is now worthless. I dropped the camera twice, the first time I caught my elbow on something and the camera fell onto concrete, breaking the battery door. The warranty does not cover falls and fixing it was going to be very expensive... the 2nd time the camera was dropped when a friend was handing it back to me, it fell on the lens and the lens is now stuck out at a bad angle... Fixing it was going to cost more than replacing it... You can say its my fault, but camera's get dropped and they should be able to handle a decent fall.

The focus doesn't work well in low light conditions. 50% of low light pics are blurry due to it. Don't even think about taking pics at night of scenes or landscapes or theme park type of objects. They will not come out well. Even at 5 MP I didn't find the images as being rich in color. The screen is so big so there is less place to hold the camera. It's heavy and becomes very easy to wobble and drop while holding it with one hand. Operating buttons with one hand is hard. The special modes such as candle light mode and portrait mode and night mode are all useless and non-usable. They overexpose the picture and everything comes out blurry. You have to press the shutter button twice. First to focus and then to click.Bottom line : I do not recommend this camera. The big screen is not as attractive a feature as it sounds. 5MP is a waste of memory. Just go for a 3.2 or 4 MP camera where the picture quality is rich and clear at day or night.PROs:-----1. The flash is strong and in good light conditions the camera works excellent.2. Battery life is very long and charger comes free with camera.3. Processing time is quite fast if you use memory stick PRO.4. The software which comes with this camera is fantastic. It lets you generate MPEG slide show videos of your pics in a very artistic fashion with nostagic music playing in background. Its a really wonderful software.5.
