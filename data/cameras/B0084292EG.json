I thought it would be a good beginner camera for a pre teen. I would have been better off buying from the dollar store. It is cheaply made and only takes 10 pictures, then you need to upload or delete before you can take more :(", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Breathless \"Dir En Grey Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3TIUAW9HE580L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I rate this camera a 1 star and would rate it a zero star if I could. The display is too hard to read, even with brand new, top of the line batteries, picture taking is too difficult and I cannot take pictures I do manage to take off the camera and onto my laptop, even with help of the C.D that comes with it. Seller should stop selling these as product is really that terrible.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not at all worth it...", "Author": "Miss Rebecca", "ReviewID": "R1QU7WJQRPZ5GR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had purchased the camera in order to have a cheap camera to take places I would prefer not to take my more expensive ones, and I was horrendously disappointed at the picture quality. I took a test shot in a well-lit room, and the picture was still dark, grainy and blurry. If you're paying for it, I would recommend just giving it to a kid to play with - it's not worth keeping it, otherwise.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I hated them", "Author": "Debbie", "ReviewID": "R11Q6DJ94UBVBW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Poor pictures!
