{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An amazing advanced piece of gear", "Author": "lloydl", "ReviewID": "R38OZCL3V4D4SH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am an amateur photographer who got his start with a Minolta 101, then a maxxum 7000.  When Sony took over the Minolta rights and technologies, it was natural for me to continue with their product line.  My Alpha 100 was a decent camera and when I decided to take the plunge for a full frame the a99 caught my eye and has proven to be everything any of the other preceeding cameras weren't.  Amazing in low light, Well thought out buttons and layout that make it easy to make the key adjustments on the fly.  The electron view finder is great and was an area of concern before I bought.  This is a great camera, maybe a little on the high side price wise, however this bundle included a vertical grip, a 64gb memory card and the hvl 60 flash adding almost 1000 of additional gear.  I am more than pleased with this camera and looking forward to adding 2470 zeiss 2.8 at some point in the future.  In the meantime I make due with my old Minolta maxxum lens a 28 -135  a 70 -300 and a 50 1.7.  I highly recommend this camera it rocks.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,799.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Sony Alpha SLT-A99 Full Frame Digital SLR Camera Body with Sony VG-C99AM Control Grip and Sony HVL-F60M Flash +\n<2> Sony LCS-SC21 DSLR Camera Case + <3> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card +\n<4> Spare NP-FM500H Battery + <5> Battery Charger + <6> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<7> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <8> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <9> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Sony Alpha SLT-A99 Full Frame Digital SLR Camera Body & VG-C99 Grip & HVL-F60M Flash with 64GB Card + Battery + Case + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5174Nx7oCPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CD64HDU"}}
