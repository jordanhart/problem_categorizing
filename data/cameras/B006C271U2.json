I was pleased with it and excited to use it.First of all, the weight of the camera was a surprise. It was very light weighted and not too big. Secondly the camera is very easy to use and all the buttons were very straight forward.My biggest problem was the results of the prints. The first couple of prints I printed out didn't look too sharp and seemed dirty. But after the 6th photo, the colors, and sharpness of the print got better.Overall I am satisfied with the camera. But I felt like the set should of also included a case or a sort of bag for the camera.I recommend this camera to older people and to those who want a simple camera that isn't too complicated to use!", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006C271U2"}}
