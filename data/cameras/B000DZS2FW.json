I was told that FujiFilm was a good brand to go with, but every camera I looked at had some issue. Eventually I decided to go with this camera, but was terrified that it would be of bad quality. When I finally got it, I was so relieved. THIS CAMERA IS AWESOME! The pictures are of great quality, and the LCD screen is so clear and big! The only thing that is a bit hard is that the keys are tiny, which might be harder for people with large fingers. I strongly recomend you read the manual, because with my past cameras I missed out on features such as black and white pictures, and being able to crop the pictures ON THE CAMERA!To anyone who just wants a nice camera, but is worried about what to get, go with this camera and you won't be dissapointed.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Annie", "ReviewID": "RC9NLIDU6E6UH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recently my old Fujifilm 2600Z stopped working after many years of reliable service.  I love the colors of Fujifilm digital cameras so I ordered a Fuji A700.  I was very disappointed with the camera (blurry and grainy photos).  I ended up exchanging the A700 for a Sony cybershot.  The sony was even worse than the A700 (blurry and dull color).  I took the Sony back too.  I was beginning to believe I'd never find another camera that I liked as much as my old Fuji.  Well, I found it in the F470.  This camera takes great pictures in any lighting - crystal clear and vivid color.  I also like the fact that you can take photos one right after another with very little time in between snapping shots.  This would be a great camera for someone with little kids that are always in motion and you want to take one picture quickly after another.The only reason I gave this camera 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would prefer it to have regular alkaline or rechargable batteries that are cheaper and easier to find.  Overall, after looking at three cameras, this one wins hands down.I noticed a lot of people are asking what comes in the box in addition to the camera.  This is what came in mine:  USB cable, A/V cable, battery, battery charger, CD of software, and owner's manual.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "great size", "Author": "Hector David Becerra Hernandez \"neco\"", "ReviewID": "R1XXSWBZFY32BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bougth this beatuful camera and its great the screen is amazing, i worried about tyhe rechargable batery but it says that is enough for 200 pictures and already took almost 90 pics and still says full charge.the time to charge the full batery is 90 min and is exact 90 min is totaly full charge. is complety made of metal and the ccd sistem for fuji make the pics look more than amaizing even in dark placesi complety recoment this product is great", "Date": "April 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Elena \"Elena\"", "ReviewID": "R7H2SENVAG41Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "small inexpensive camera but very good for the price.

I wanted at least 5MPs in my camera and I wanted to get a halfway decent size card to store pictures, all for under $300.  I have been using my parents Canon Powershot SD400 Digital Elph that has great quality, but I was worried about the LCD screen because I might be a little rough on the camera (i.e., backpacking, shoving into a bag or my pocket) and it didn't fit into my budget.  I looked at the Casio Exilim, but I did not want to use a cradle to download my pictures if I was traveling with my laptop.  I decided on the Fuji because it had 6MPs, a large screen and seemed like it got well reviews.  I just received it and have been taking pictures and movies with it.  The photo quality is great when downloaded on to the computer.  It took a while to get use to the quality on the screen because it is not as good as the Canon I have.  The movies are great, but I cannot zoom when filming (not a real big deal).  The sound quality isn't as good as my other camera but that could be my computer or the fact that the talking subject was close to the mic.  I don't mind not having a view finder because I never really used it on my other digital cameras.  The buttons would be rather small for some one with big fingers but I have no problem.  I not too sure about the software I am still playing around with it, but it seems just like every other digital camera software.Along with the camera, I got a 512 MB picture card, which is big enough for me with around 300+ pictures.  I got all this (the camera, the card, and shipping) for around $280.  It is great for what I wanted an inexpensive camera that takes good quality photos, which I will be emailing.

However within 5 months the camera stopped functioning. We sent it to the Fuji Repair center and was told it would be fixed or replaced within 2 weeks. It took six weeks to receive a replacement. Five weeks after getting this replacement the exact same thing went wrong - the camera starts up, the lcd panel goes blank, the lens won't retract and the only way to turn it off is to remove the battery.

I've bought several for home and school and they always take wonderful photos on even the cheapest model.I was going to buy a new little Olympus, and my son talked me into considering this little Fujifilm Finepix instead. I have to say that this is the most awesome camera I have seen for around $200. It has many special settings--but a day with the owner's manual and a little experimentation has allowed me to try some of these out and it really adds alot of dimension to a point and shoot camera. I love the \"flower\" setting. It makes really great close ups--they almost look 3-D on the flower setting. The automatic setting is wonderful--great shots with point and shoot. But there are also low light settings, micro settings, short video with sound from a built in mic.  I'm still experimenting with all the settings--but so far--great fun--and really wonderful resolution and color. I almost feel like I have some of the control back that I used to have with my 35 mm. This camera is very compact--I have to wear my glasses to see the menu items--but they are logical little symbols--which are easier to see than most. The buttons are large enough to press with no trouble. I think what I am most impressed with is the actual color--it is brighter and more intense than the Olympus I was going to buy.Banjo Dreamin' Suwannee Nights", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Brand New!", "Author": "B.

He said he had offers from his friends to buy it off of him for more than he had paid, plus his wife figured out how to use it......which means that its user friendly. I love the fact that you have a rechargeable battery so you don't have to carry batteries with you or continually have batteries on hand. It has a TV hook up which I have used twice to show off your photo's on a TV rather than the LCD screen, and it has the USB hook-up. It comes with software for your computer but I never installed it, per my brother you don't need it and I haven't had too. The only complaint I have is that there is 1 bad mega pixel on the LCD screen and when viewing through the TV it shows the little white dot from the bad mega pixel.

The first one was wonderful, and I assumed this one would be also, but after a year of use I am very disappointed. I'm not a professional photographer, I just need a point and shoot that is dependable on vacation and at special events.  My f470 is in working order - what makes this camera undependable has something to do with the design.The biggest problem with the F470 is the design of the LCD screen.  It's simply horrid when you're taking outdoor pictures.  The screen may be large but in bright sunlight it's next to impossible to see what you're going to get. It's just 2.5 inches of darkness. My previous Fuji had a viewfinder; there was no problem seeing what I was shooting - in any level of light.The LCD screen is also difficult to see from any sort of an angle.  So, unless I'm holding the camera in front of my face, I have only a vague idea of what I'm photographing.The screen is a battery hog and it doesn't seem to bring much to the table on this camera model.Another problem with this camera is that a good 30 percent of my shots are fuzzy and blurry.  I know my hands don't shake perceptibly.  This has been more of an issue with this camera than with any other I've ever owned (And I've owned quite a few in my life.)The software, while not horribly difficult, is not especially user friendly either.  The editing features are so limited that I felt it was necessary to purchase another photo editing software package just to satisfactorily crop and resize the shots.All that being said, when everything comes together the f470 can take a nice clear, bright picture.However, I've lost so many irreplaceable shots because of the limitations of this camera that I'm ready to put it aside and purchase a new camera with stabilization, a view finder in addition to the LCD screen, and the more easily found SD cards.Two and a half stars - not recommended.", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!!", "Author": "K.

Windows XP detects the camera once the USB cable is connected.

I wish it used SD card so I could reuse the cards between my other camera.2) Must take out the battery to charge it. I wish I could charge it within the camera.3) It forgets the date setting once battery is removed (for charging). So, every time you charge the battery, you have to set the date and time.Because of this device, we now have many more pictures (memories) than we would have otherwise had.

The large screen on the back is nice to look at, but saps the battery life quickly. Speaking of battery, the indicator shows the battery as being fully charged for ages and then suddenly blinks almost empty before shutting off unexpectedly. This happened both with the battery that came with the camera and the extra battery I bought.As if I wasn't unhappy already, things quickly started malfunctioning. After 5 mos many buttons stopped working, and now all the buttons on the back panel stopped, making the camera almost unusable (I can't get into the menus, turn on/off the flash, etc).Yes, the camera takes good pics and has a nice screen, but you have to cart around the special Fuji brand cables & cards which you spent a lot more buying.
