What is a 1-megapixel camera you ask? Well, it's about the maximum resolution (the best) you would want for a digital camera whose main task will be taking pictures for emailing or website posting. Higher resolution makes for larger files which require not only more time to upload (i.e. to transfer to an email or to post on a website), but more time to download for your reader. In fact, the new 3-megapixel cameras make photo files so large that a person with a well-tuned 56k (regular modem) connection would have to wait almost 6 minutes to download (view) a single photo! This particular camera then is well-suited to internet apps, and you'll probably use it on lower than 1-megapixel resolution most of the time.  PROS: 1) Price 2) Quality  3) USB connection  4) CompactFlash (expandable) memory  5) Through-the-lens shooting. CONS: 1) Limited zoom (digital zooms are poor relatives of optical zooms)  2) High battery usage  3) Mediocre flash capability.", "Date": "October 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R264CQ34K9T230", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This particular camera is a great buy.

Once a new user quits fiddling with the LCD view screen, he will realize the benefits of these power saving features.  To maximize camera function go out and immediately buy a flash card.  Look on Amazon for the Lexar 16mb compactflash card with the JumpShot USB cable.  With it I can download 187 pictures in less than a minute.  Downside is that internal 2mb memory is bypassed when using the flash card but it is no big deal.

Kodak didn't try to reinvent the wheel.Performance: I started out lookng at a cheap 640 by 480 camera. This is a great improvement. There is a high enough resolution to let you trim your images to correct poor aim or reduce the size before emailing.Ease of Use: Worked great right out of the box. Dislikes:Serial Cable: It takes forever to download photos and burns through batteries like crazy. Small Memory: 2Meg is not large enough to be practical, perhaps 6 pictures at the highest resolution.Software: The \"Pictures Now\" software isn't very good. It runs very slowly on my AMD 380 PC.

And, as a very picky 35mm photographer, I should point out that even at the higher quality settings, you shouldn't expect to get high-quality prints larger than snap-shot size.*BUT*: Given the resolution of the camera, the quality of the images is excellent; My first use of the camera was on a disney vacation, and I gave it a huge work-out. I added a 48 meg memory card to it, shot hundreds of photos, and really appreciated the ability to delete pictures right out of the camera - that way you can go crazy take a ton of pictures, then delete the ones that didn't work out.I'd give the camera five stars, but the fact that it doesn't come with a video cable or memory card is kind of frustrating.

The LCD screen is convenient, because you can see exactly what you're taking a picture of, when you take it.The camera has 3 different levels of quality for pictures.  The high quality pictures won't allow you to zoom, but then again, you can zoom and crop the pictures later, so it's just as nice.  With the low quality pictures, there is the benefit of a 2X zoom, which allows you to get right up on the object for some good detil.The flash has 3 settings... On, automatic, and off, so you can choose the best lighting for your situation.A complete, easy to use, windows based menu makes this camera easy and fun to use, and with the memory card (optional) allows you to take anywhere from 40 to 120 pictures at a time - depending on the quality you choose.Overall, a great little camera that gets the job done with all the quality of 35mm and the benefit of digital.

Up to this point I've used a variety of regular 35mm cameras.  This camera is a good intro to digital at an excellent entry price with very acceptable quality.  Obviously for more money comes more features and higher quality, but if you're just going to have fun with snapshots, pictures for auctions, and general usage, particularly internet usage, you'll be pleased.One flaw, however, cost it a star in my rating- the flash is too bright on subjects at typical snapshot range indoors or at night.  I normally have to turn off the flash and settle for room lighting, but so far I've managed to get decent pictures if I hold the camera still enough.  But forget it in the dark, unless the subjects are far enough away- like maybe outdoors- and then you can use the flash.  Also needs a self-timer.As others say, get the rechargeable batteries and 64mg Compact Flash card (price of these has really dropped.)

They are:1.  The power on light (green) is right next to the manual viewfinder.  Having a green light this close to the veiwfinder makes it harder to use.  Using the 1.6 inch LCD screen is more of a WYSIWYG type of picture also when I compared both views.2.  No lens cover.  A lens cover attached with a small rope would have made this more attractive in buying, even at $10 more.3.  AC adapter non-standard voltage (not included).  A 7 volt adapter is propritary item, that cannot be bought cheap, like the standard variable voltage adapters, even though the camera uses four 1.5 volt batteries, 6 volts, which is standard.4.  USB transfer would have been nice, but I think this would have inflated the price too much.  Serial is slow, but its affordable, and it does not affect quality of the picture.Good things are:1.  The pictures turn out well.  Included software makes it easy to send pictures to the PC, cleaned if necessary, and to be printed.2.  The 1.6 LCD color display is nice.  Every digital camera should have one.  Don't buy one if not included.  Its nice to see what you have taken, and what you are about to take.3.  The TV hookup to view pictures from the camera is nice feature to see the quality of a photo taken.  I was surprised the cable was not included for this feature.  If the cable would have added $5 to the price, it should have been included.4.  It came with batteries.  1.2 volt re-chargable NiCads can be used as well.5.  Built in flash.  Auto or manual.  Nice.  I think most (if not all) digital cameras have them.6.  FlashCard memory expansion slot (standard).  Room for extra room is always nice.

Now the bad stuff;sorry to break the news to you though,but not everything's perfect.The worst thing about it is the enourmous power consumption by the LCD screen.You can't have the camera on for 20 minutes without the battery running out.Next is the zoom.For one thing it only magnifies the pictures 2x so you really can't get that much closer.Plus it's digital.An optical zoom changes the size of the Iris in the lense so the object seems closer than it really is.Digital zoom just electronically magnifies the pixels that make up the picture so the quality of the shot decreases.And finally,but LEAST importantly the delete time for internal memory.To delete just one picture from the camera's storage system takes like 6 seconds!So try not to screw up when you don't have a memory card.

The software, like the camera, is good, basic, and simple to use. It's not going to let you do alot fancy, high tech stuff, however it will let you do some simple modifications; contrast, red-eye, sepia, etc. As with all digital cameras it is a battery hog. I invested, and suggest you will need to do the same, in rechargable batteries. Also, the 2MB of memory is not nearly sufficient and you will probably end up buying a flash card of some type.

If you want to print photo quality pictures this does the job, but other cams do it much better. Other things to keep in mind: DO NOT use flash with the subject within a 5ft range. You will have taken a picture of Casper =). Make sure your subject is still, otherwise you'll get blurry images. LCD viewer is slow to catch up if you move the camera around to quickly.

(Well, at least they think they did...) Overall, I like this camera. I have taken 1000's of photos with it, and I am quite happy with them. But I do have three main complaints about it, and two of them are related. One, there is no tripod mount, and two, the speed of the camera. Due to how long it takes to take a photo, you MUST hold the camera perfectly still to get a good clear photo. However, you do get used to that, and since you can't use a tripod, I came up with something that works, although it is a bit crude.To do this you need a standard tripod, and a piece of 2x4 that is the same length as the camera is wide. Drill a hole in the bottom of the 2x4 and make it so the tripod mount will screw into it, making sure it fits securely. Then take a strap of some sort that is strong enough to hold the camera, but doesn't block the viewfinder, lens, or buttons and or switches on the camera, and secure it to the 2x4. Then set your camera on top of it, and fasten it down. You end up with a crude tripod setup that works. When I started doing this, I had much better results overall.My third complaint is about the focus and light levels. Although that is to be expected in a cheap camera. If you want quality, and have $5,000.00 to $10,000.00 laying around, a Nikon D1x is the kind. But how many people need that, or have that kind of money? The DC3200 is a good cheap camera.A word of advice for whoever wrote the editorial review, and for Phil Smith, who said it takes forever to download photos and burns through batteries like crazy... Buy a CompactFlash Memory Card and a Card Reader that is compatible with the new version of USB ports, and toss that serial cable. What used to take hours (and tons of batteries) now takes meer seconds, and one set of batteries now lasts 100 times longer, because all you do with them is take photos. And for mdsmithers, who broke his battery compartment door, I did that too. One word, my friend... Rubberband. It works like a charm. :-)Once you have your photos, I recommend Paint Shop Pro for photo editing. For less than $100.00 normally, it has all the bells and whistles you need to spruce up photos taken with a DC3200. You don't need to spend $1000.00 on a good photo editor.If not for the speed of the camera, and the battery compartment door...

It will be missed.", "Date": "April 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "A Fine Beginner's Digital Camera", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R1I73W6I37VAUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While it is by no means the most feature rich digital camera available, it is a fine point-and-click camera that will get you good quality photos without busting the bank. It has its pluses and its minuses like anything else, but it still remains a fine digital camera especially for first time buyers. It is pretty inexpensive but you don't really loose quality for a lower price. Its main shortcomings are that it has a flash that could be seen from the moon. It is way too bright for taking pictures up close in a dark situation. However, the flash can be diffused somewhat by securing a piece of tissue over the flash. Since it is a budget model digital camera it has only a 2X digital zoom, which is not really very useful, but it does have it anyhow. Another downside to this camera is its use of a serial cable to transfer the pictures from camera to computer. This isn't bad at all if you have only five or six photos, but more than twenty will be a tiring experience. The camera also comes with a tiny amount of internal memory (2MB). This is not nearly enough memory to allow a user to store photos from a week long vacation. To combat this shortcoming a CompactFlash memory card is a must. I personally have a 32MB Lexar card and it works splendidly. Rechargeable batteries are also a must. It also lacks a self timer.Despite all this the camera does have several pluses. For one thing it is very easy to use. There are only five buttons on the back of the camera and two of those control the zoom feature. Deleting photos from memory can often be accomplished using only two buttons. This camera also comes with an LCD which is a welcome addition. I think the LCD is too bright and doesn't give you an accurate preview of the picture, but it is much better than having no LCD at all. It also has a slot that allows the user to install an inexpensive CompactFlash card in order to store many times over what the internal memory can store. While you will never get really high quality photos from this camera, you will get lots of use out of it if you are content to store pictures on your hard-drive or a CD-RW. As I said before, this camera certainly has it's faults, but it also has plenty of reasons why it would make a fine beginner's digital camera.", "Date": "November 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great quality of pictures for the price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R33W28PM2I4XIW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a year and have had absolutely no problems with it. It wasn't hard to learn to use either. My young children use my camera to take pictures with it and are able to view the pictures they took if that tells you anything and they are elementary age. You do have to be still when taking pictures but it is not as bad as the cheaper cameras. We have had 3 digital cameras before this one, and this one is by far the best we've found for the price. When I have more money to spend on a camera, I will probably upgrade slightly. For this last year, it has been great and cheap. We bought a case to keep the camera in because it did not come with one. We got a memory card to go with it and can take way more pictures now. Also, we invested in a flash card reader so it is lots quicker to get the pictures off. It used to take a long time to do it the old way. If you have ever seen a bad digital camera image like from the JamCam or the cheaper Creative cameras, the Kodak images are nothing like that. The images do not look like alien photos with solar flares. The conditions might have to be right, but you can get a good image from this camera. One feature I like is that you can control if you want the flash on or off and some you cannot. I have not had film developed in a year now, and I have saved so much money. ... I think it is great that the price has gone so low. I would pay a hundred for it in a heartbeat. Used to, I would tell people to not buy a digital camera unless it was in the hundred dollar range because anything else would produce low quality images. This camera produces nice images.

You need to get close to the subjuct and not very much movement to get the shot. This camera is NOT forgiving. It will however make good 5x7 size pictures, but it is not too good for larger sizes. I did have some large size photos come out. The larger the more blurry they will become. We bought this thinking we would save some money on developing cost. I think we may have spent it on on ink. It is good for basic still somewhat close shots that you will be archiving with a cd burner and to lets the kids learn the art taking pictures.

The 1 megapixel resolution is not high enough to print a large regular photo quality picture. If you set the camera to its highest resolution you might be able to print an acceptible 5x7 photo. The memory included with the camera is not enough. It will hold two or so highest quality photos and about 16 normal e-mail quality photos.

The software, like the camera, is good, basic, and simple to use. It's not going to let you do alot fancy, high tech stuff, however it will let you do some simple modifications; contrast, red-eye, sepia, etc. As with all digital cameras it is a battery hog. I invested, and suggest you will need to do the same, in rechargable batteries. Also, the 2MB of memory is not nearly sufficient and you will probably end up buying a flash card of some type.
