When digital point and shoot started making the scene I started using them. I like both. The Cannon T3 is the affordable best of both worlds camera. The bundle that includes two lenses, two batteries, a backpack and more made my purchase even better. I have no \"buyers remorse\" at all. Now I am ready for the two graduations, a wedding, a championship T-Ball tournament and a championship Hockey match that are happening in my family over the next few months.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great deal", "Author": "Tavo", "ReviewID": "R3T7G9EZ73J80M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "sweet camera, but my only complain is that the RF sensor is not there anymore, still good package price and great pics", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0057YDBMS"}}
