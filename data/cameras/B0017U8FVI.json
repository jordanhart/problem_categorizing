{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WiLife's Survellience Cameras Did What I Wanted Them to Do, But They Do Have Limitations", "Author": "George McAdams", "ReviewID": "R2SNC46IMWUGBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Wilife camera system for two months, and I've found it meets my needs to provide a view of what's happening at certain places around the house (inside or out).  I found the system delivers the goods by providing the homeowner a fairly clear image, stores the image in an easily managed retrieval program, and you can view \"what is happening\" when you are away from home over the Internet via your laptop or a smart phone.  Also, you can individually set the cameras up to have the system E-mail or text you if there is motion detected or the system goes \"off-line.\"The skinny review:Pluses:  for the most part easy set-up, trouble shooting is extensively detailed (Logitech obviously wants you to be able to solve connection problems), Internet accessibility actions are recorded (and easily accessed), adaptability, the quality of the images can be varied, images can be saved, and movies can be saved of what is picked-up by the camera(s) in a WMA file.Negatives: starts to get pricey by the time you get your 4th camera, some places in the house not easily receptive to signals and not all cameras are suited to all areas (I write about this below).Full Review:This \"Starter\" system with the indoor camera is a great way to see what the system can do for you.  I say this because, for me, the indoor camera was a little harder to set-up, but it also was flexible enough that I was able to easily change its location and could tell where I wanted to place my other cameras before purchasing them. In setting these locations, I sometimes used a laptop connected to the Internet to give me instant feedback on my placement of cameras and what the image would look like.Regarding problems, most had to do with receiving the signal from various points in my house, and my house, approaching 40 years old, has its share of additions that I am thinking a newer home with continuous wiring won't have this problem.  But, I am getting ahead of myself.I do not know why a \"surveillance\" system has always intrigued me, but over the years I have tried several different wireless products (X-10's system, another wireless system with the cameras used with USB 2.0 water-proof Wireless Web Ready DVR Security System w/ 4 Pack Highigh Resolution Indoor/Outdoor Night Vision Surveillance Cameras with only \"poor\" to \"fair\" results.  WiLife's system provided me with an affordable \"starter\" system, a good image, and it kept track of the activity that the cameras recorded.Here are my observations regarding the system with all of the various components and their installation:First of all, it is easy to hook-up.  With the starter kit for the inside, I installed the software on a media computer I had integrated into my audio/visual system,  plugged-in the receiver to an outlet that wasn't \"protected\" by a surge protector and placed the camera in another part of the house, plugging that camera's LAN-like connector into another outlet.  The first time I hooked it up, it searched for the camera(s) after I told it I had \"one.\"  As I added cameras, I merely clicked on the \"add additional cameras\" button, changed the number of cameras, and it found them.  With regards to firewall issues, I use OneCare Windows Live OneCare 2.0 (Up to 3 Users) for my computer's security, and it handled this for me by asking if I wanted to allow WiLife.  I did and that issue was solved.With regards to set-up issues and the inside camera, I live in a rather sprawling house that has multiple floors and an addition (which is why my \"radio signal\" X-10 and other cameras had problems).  I took the  camera and placed it in different areas to see how it worked.  In all but two places, it worked well and was easily picked-up by the WiLife program.  With the camera at one location, after several times of not being able to discover it, the program actually had me assign an address, like an IP address, for the camera.  After doing that, it worked fine, but I ended-up using an outside camera at that location, which picked-up the signal right away.  NOTE:  while I did not use the manual to work-out my problems, the manual is very detailed and a very good manual, especially in working through connection and firewall problems (if you have them).  The manual is available on the CD and from their websight [...], and if you have any doubts about whether to get the system, you should download the manual and glance through it.  In hindsight, I should have consulted it in addition to the instructions given by the program's help section in dealing with my minor problems.As for the various set-ups, on one camera I use the infrared light, and it is very inobtrusive.  On the other cameras, I have an inside camera that is affixed to a window by the suction cup with the wide angle lens and another inside camera that is just in a room.  This inside camera with the suction cup has stayed attached since I attached it six-weeks ago.  One note about the infrared camera, it should not be used around a pool or spa for it sometimes \"shows,\" depending on the color of the swimsuit, the swimmer's figure under the swimsuit.Which camera work best?  The outdoor camera works best. I have a good picture from dawn to dusk (and even in twilight), and I have not had any problems with them sending the picture to the WiLife Computer Center.  I have one of them pointed at my front door and one in the backyard that can view my hot tub or the backyard (more on that in a minute).  I wish there was a way I could post a video, but if you look-up my name on youtube, I have posted one that shows the neighborhood children coming to the front door and getting candy from my wife. In that video, you'd see the picture of the entrance with just the light coming through the fixed-lights in the door, then, the fluorescent floodlights come-on (those usually take a few seconds to \"warm\" up), and finally the lights on the side of the doors come on.  During the day, the picture is very good (I have posted a picture of the front door during the day).With the backyard outdoor camera, I attached-it to something my X-10 camera used that could rotate the camera to fixed points that one established.  It was called a \"ninja\" unit, and I have found it to be helpful in allowing my backyard camera to view several spots in rotation, or however I want to do it.The clock, or \"spy,\" camera is another camera that is easy to use.  I hooked it up, and it was worked fine from the get-go.  It picks-up an image in slightly lower light better than the inside camera. If there is one thing I wish the system had, it's that the clock camera had a battery back-up.  While the electricity doesn't go off but once or twice a year where I live, it is still something I wish it had.  On the plus side, the clock is one of the easiest I have found to reset.The system has done what I wanted it to do:  I had some concerns that some of the neighbor children were trying to get into the spa, and the cameras showed me this wasn't true (my small dog was actually slipping-in through a 4-in opening);  It shows me who is at, and who has come to, the front and other doors; and it has shown me what, if anything, my daughter does in my audio/visual room when I am not at home.If I had young children, I would probably have one of the cameras in their room and in their playroom, and pointed outside to the yards where they play.  With my dog, I have been able to find-out if he is damaging anything while being left alone (sometimes he is guilty).  Because the cameras turn-on and record activity, and show the recording on a time-line, one can easily go back and view what has happen during those recordings.This is not a security system, but I have found it supplements the centralized alarm system on my house quite well.  Which brings-up an instance, and a feature I have not mentioned, the ability to view what is happening over your computer or your smart phone.  We were out of town for the day, and I received a call about the alarm going off.  The police were on their way to the house and the alarm dispatcher was checking to see if we had done anything to trigger the alarm.  I told them no, and to let me know if they found anything.  I immediately logged-in on the WiLife web site with my smart phone and clicked on the outside cameras.  Because this was at night, I first saw the policeperson's flashlight at one of the entrances to the backyard (the alarm came from the back door being opened).  Then, the outside security lights came on, and finally the police checking the doors.  With the WiLife system, you can actually have notices sent to you if there is activity from any of the cameras by text and even an image of what triggered the camera if you want that information.  Some of these features require a subscription fee, and  this might be something you would want to consider.  I have the subscription and like it.  Regarding this instance, it turned-out that I forgot to close one door all the way and dog pushed it open.Overall, I have found the WiLife System has met my needs.  I did get the extended warranties on equipment through NEW as offered on Amazon, and have been pleased with their service.  The two times I have had a warranty issue with other equipment (a computer and a printer), NEW has taken care of the matter quickly or has had very good technical support to help me resolve the problem  Even though I am not anticipating any problems with the WiLife System, sometimes it doesn't hurt to have the extra protection.  I especially thought an extended warranty would be good since one cannot hook-it-up through an UPS or surge protector.  I have uploaded several pictures to give you an idea of how the images sent by the cameras look.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Logitech Wilife Security LukWerks Indoor Master System - Nice Set With Updated Components", "Author": "Mark \"Technology, Music and Movies\"", "ReviewID": "R2CFQNA6J9S3U9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Logitech WiLife Digital Video Security Indoor Master System is my second set in this group of security products.  I've added on a few components and learned how to deal with more of the system's features and quirks.  As far as home security camera systems go, this is a very nice value.  While I haven't had any issues with the components I have purchased, the previous incarnation did have some warts that have hopefully been addressed with this update.This unit includes the Wilife management software, one indoor camera, suction cup mount, bar mount, table stand and power and USB connectors.  I like the product, although there are some reservations.  You have to know your needs very well in order to know if this is right for you.The design of the indoor cameras is very unique though somewhat blocky. The outdoor cameras are more traditionally shaped.  In any event, they all seem to work well once set up.PROS:+ Updated hardware and software should improve reliability and ease of use+ Nice power over Ethernet design means no batteries needed+ Nice price for a fully functioning starter system+ Improved cell phone and email alert features+ Very easy to add cameras to the system+ Nice available accessories to add on to your installation+ Nice interface for management software with many customizable settings+ Default settings will meet the needs of novice users without adjustments+ System is motion activated, saving storage space+ Video recordings are easily backed, copied, or erased+ Video can be accessed via live feed over the internet+ Firmware updates are readily available, with caveatsCONS:- Installation can be somewhat time-consuming- Despite what they tell you, DO NOT ENABLE AUTOMATIC FIRMWARE UPDATES!!! Do them manually- Some features require a premium subscription at an additional cost- The starter set should have included at least one more camera- Lack of audio will disappoint more demanding users- Latency on website video access- Software interface requires some getting used toCONSIDERATIONS1. Your camera must be close to an outlet to connect it via the included 10 foot cable.2. You have to manually adjust the camera focus, so adjust it before mounting.3. Your computer must meet the hardware and software requirements.4. Your computer must be on all the time for video recording.5. You will need a broadband connection to access this video remotely.6. This power-line connection will work better with newer wiring.7. It's best to set up extra hard drive space for at least 10 GB of videos.8. The computer recording video needs to be a PC.  A Mac running Windows in a virtual machine software might work.INSTALLATIONPhysically installing the cameras is straightforward.  The receiver and the camera must be attached through power outlet via receiver plugs.  The system connects to your computer over the power interface via the USB port.The software installation still requires some patience and hardware knowledge.  Computers running Windows Vista, Antivirus software and software firewalls will need those security settings disabled to get the Wilife software to install.  Still, it's well worth it to have this system installed on a secure computer.  You can re-enable all that stuff when you are done, making sure to allow for your firewall to permit the Wilife software to access the internet.Installing on XP may be slightly easier, but you will still have to deal with disabling your Antivirus or desktop firewall if you are running those. You should want the computer that's storing your home security video files to be secure.  Taking the extra time to have AV and a firewall working is worth the effort.Windows Vista requires a few reboots before the software installs and sees the cameras.  On my first installation of the product I experienced some initial hanging, but I had better luck the second time I set up the starter kit in a different location. So the software has been improved, but it is still beneficial to be comfortable with computers.Setup can take about an hour or two depending on how you place your cameras and the speed of your computer.  If you have issues, contacting support should be relatively painless, though I have not had to call them with the two systems I have set up.SETTINGS AND EXPANSIONThe system has options for adding on hardware in terms of more cameras and software in terms of premium features.  If you want multiple cameras, you will have to buy those additional units as add-ons.  It would have been nice if they would have simply produced a starter set with one of each or some other configurations.  Still, most users will be happy with the starter sets.The Wilife Homeplug Bridge can integrate this with the pro set.  Those that want to avoid using power-line communications may prefer to step up to the Wilife Pro Set or a different system all together.The management options for this unit are nice.  You can adjust the setting for motion sensitivity to your liking after you are familiar and have been running this for a while.  Phone or email notifications are easily set for motion activated recordings.  The software lets you define the limits that must be exceeded to trigger an alert.The Wilife wasn't my first security system, and I've been happy with both the original and the update.  Experienced users will love the features, except for a few functions which require you to upgrade to the premium package.  Given the cost it's hard to argue with the features.CONCLUSIONThis is a nice set that has continued to improve.  It's worth looking into depending on your needs and budget.Enjoy!", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "15-Minute Install?  Not Exactly . . .", "Author": "Phyllis Staff", "ReviewID": "R1V0F3AG1IFN0F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Wilife Digital Security System is the first video security system I've had that really works . . . at least part of the time.  But it's a far cry from foolproof.  And I'll admit to being something of a fool when it comes to electronics.I wanted this system to be able to look in on my sleeping mother (she has Alzheimer's disease) without waking her.  And it turns out that the system is pretty good for that purpose, sometimes.  Here's what I experienced:The GoodHaving this system in a bedroom where you want to look in on a baby or elder sometimes requires seeing in the dark.  This camera is surprisingly good at producing an image in light where your eye fails to register an image.  Lighten up your screen, if necessary, but you won't have to turn on a light to disturb your sleeper.The images produced are at or above the level of security cameras I've seen.  Good, but not great.  And good is enough to accomplish my purpose.So far, so good, but wait!  There's more.The BadInstalling this system was anything but the 15-minute breeze promised by the Logitech blurb.  I ended up calling their support number (the rep was helpful and pleasant) and finally resolved the problem with new software.  (six hours)I wasn't done yet.  The software needed to recognize the camera - and that took several trips to the Knowledge base to resolve.  Turns out this system does not work or play well with my firewall (or my virus protection), so all those programs had to be turned off in order for camera recognition to occur (another four hours).Then my sleeper complained about the brightness of the light on the spy clock.  I toned it down with a sheet of paper cut to fit the display, and she was pacified (another hour).  Had I not taken this step, she would have removed the camera from her room, and the whole exercise would have been for naught.The UglyThe system refused to work at all this morning.  Apparently, another program was interfering with recognition of the USB device, so I had to go through the entire install procedure again (another hour and 1/2).  By this time, my temper is becoming frayed at the edges, and I'm wondering if it's really worth the effort I'm putting in to it.ConclusionImage quality is good enough for my purposes, and leaving my dedicated computer on all the time, I believe I can maintain contact with the camera.  So, for me it's worth it.However, you shouldn't have to be a computer wizard to set this system up and get it working.  Installation should be the breeze promised - but for me it was not!Three stars!", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "System is fine until you have a problem!", "Author": "Sue M.", "ReviewID": "R156OKJEH6NTOW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the system just over the one year warranty.  Total investment with this system - 1,500.00 approx. (not including hiring an electrician to put outside outlets on my home to house the outside cameras).  When the system works it is wonderful, very impressed with the system. The problem was that for that one year of service, the system decided it was not going to work properly.First one camera could not be read.  Then the next day, four cameras could not be read.  After trouble shooting for three days, I discovered it was not the cameras, but possibly the CRM-100.Having to deal with the WILIFE SUPPORT was frustrating. The techs were pleasant enough, but getting the problem resolved seems to be an impossible task.My third call to Wilife, I spoke to the first tech I had on my first call and after telling him everything that I had done with trouble shooting, he concurred it had to be the CRM-100 (The part that plugs into the wall, and then into the USB on the computer). The tech set up a RMA number to get a replacement part at no charge. He told me that that part there were some problems with them.I got off the phone,happy that the three-day problem was resolved, went to fill out the info to send to the company to get the replacement part, and the online form wouldn't work.So, I called Wilife Support AGAIN to have them help me get the form sent in so I could get the replacement part.This last call to WILIFE SUPPORT was one of the biggest nightmare phone calls I have ever had with any support call I have done with any kind of electronic gear.  Turns out I was not getting any replacement part that the tech told me before on the previous phone call. I would have to pay $160 for a CRM-100 because my CRM-100 was a later model ---and that was probably why the online form did not work to get my replacement part.I would have to write a short book on this last phone call and will spare you with what had happened.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "WiLife : poor choice", "Author": "the 1 \"Ichabod Crane\"", "ReviewID": "R1V374TBNRD9SR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Setup was easy.

Before you purchase you should plan ahead and make an assessment of what your needs are. I think it is a good system for you if:1) you plan to use this as a supplement to a home alarm system2) you have a PC that meets the hardware and software specifications3) you don't mind leaving your PC on all the time4) you have good camera mounting options that are near plug-in power outlets5) you have access to a PC at work that you can use to remotely monitor your homeSome other things to consider:1) Since this system relies on a PC, if the PC happens to shut down such as for an automatic restart, security patch update, or brief power outage then you lose the ability to monitor the home until the PC boots back up. If this is a concern then you may be better suited looking into a dedicated DVR based system with battery backups.2) If you plan to mount the camera in a window then make sure that it's a window that isn't exposed to too much sunlight. My initial mounting location was in a window facing out over the front driveway. However that window was exposed to so much sunlight that at the end of the day the unit was really hot. The indoor camera is only rated up to 93F which might be why so many reviewers have had their cameras die within the first year of service. When you think about it a camera sandwiched between a glass window and some curtains might as well be out in the greenhouse in my opinion. So as a precaution I moved my camera to another window that wasn't exposed to as much heat. Hopefully this will extend its life.3) The focus range on the camera is really only sharp enough to get a clear and positive ID on someone if they are within 10 feet of the camera. I've tweaked and tweaked but that's about the best I can get out of it. If you plan to focus on something farther away you may need to consider purchasing the 50 degree lens to replace the standard 80 degree lens that is included with the camera.Now, for the good parts:1) The system is super easy to install . . .  no crawling through the attic required. As a first step I recommend downloading the latest version of the install software from the WiLife website when you order your system. The CD that came in my kit was Version 2.1 but the latest version is 2.5sp3. Once your camera master kit comes then you just need to run the setup program and follow the instructions in the online manual for configuring. It's all pretty easy and only takes about 45 minutes if you're like me and take your time doing this sort of thing. I have Windows XP service pack 3 and didn't run into any configuration issues.2) The command center is fun to use and provides most all the functionality I need. Despite what some people have said in their reviews, the motion alerts and web monitoring are both free with the master system. The motion detection will always triger the camera to record to the hard drive. If you wish to recieve an email notification that a motion detection occurred then you have to \"arm\" the notification alerts manually. Once you do this it will send you emails and/or text messages with an attachment every time a motion is detected. The trick is that you have to manually turn this function on from your home PC which isn't a big deal.  If you choose to pay for the Platinum service, then you gain the ability to schedule alerts to turn on/off automatically at certain times of the day and you also get a little more functionality with the software but I don't think I'll be paying $80 a year for those niceties. By the way, web monitoring is free also but you are limited to viewing one camera at a time and can only see what's happening live. With the platinum you can look back over past events remotely but I can wait till I get home to do that.3) The system has pretty decent low light capabilities especially when you help it out by turning on a porch light. So I'm thinking the IR add-on device may not be necessary for my application. One thing to point out is that I've discovered the frame rate automatically drops when the light conditions drop. During daylight my camera runs at 15 fps but at dark it drops down to 5 fps. There is some noise on the image in low lighting but it's not all that bad.In conclusion, I'm enjoying my WiLife system so far and can't wait to save up money to add some more cameras. The basic system is affordable, easy to install, and seems to do pretty much everything that I need. It helps me monitor activities around the house when I'm not around and it sends me alerts with photo attachments if anyone tries to approach my front door when I'm not at home. From my experience so far I highly recommend this kit but I give it 4 stars since it may not be suitable for everyone due to the limitations I've mentioned.", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can not see cameras outside of home", "Author": "Peacock", "ReviewID": "R3UOYWJS4EC2LE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited about this system and have been severely disappointed.  I bought 2 cameras and they were easy to install.  So far I have not been able to view the cameras other than inside of my home on recorded video.  This system does not work with Blackberry or iPhone.  It must be a Windows based phone.  I can not view the system from another computer as promised.  There is a firewall issue and I have enabled my router to UpnP as well as opened the ports as recommended.  I have inactivated my firewall and still can't see a thing outside of my house.  Also, tech support answers the phone but they have really limited knowledge on how to fix any real issues with compatibility.  They waste the customers time, escalate the problem and no one ever calls you back.  I would not buy this system again because of the terrible support and the limited compatibility with most other commonly used products.  I bought the system to monitor my nanny but now I have to stay up late to watch the recorded video because the system is useless to view outside of my home.

When I had the opportunity to pick this up, I was quite jazzed about it.  I've always wanted to have some sort of surveillance system I could hook into and monitor remotely.  But the WiLife offering was iffy at best, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a great choice.For starters, I had a fair amount of trouble getting the camera to be discovered by the computer base unit and the software.  And even when I did get the discovery to take place, it was 50-50 as to whether it would be there on the next pass.  What good is a security camera if it's not going to work?The second discovery is that all the really cool features like pan and zoom control are part of the unit, but you don't get to use them in your software unless you subscribe to WiLife's software offering.  That didn't leave a very good taste in my mouth.  I also had problems getting the motion control piece to work.  Whether that was also one of the \"premium\" features or not, I'm not entirely sure.  But it would have made it much easier to review footage that was motion-activated rather than every second of every day, even if the area was deserted.By and large, this is a nice concept but not well-executed.

I received mine and it was up and running quickly . I would expect to spend a day off to figure out a system and a little more time to tweak it and get set up online . I just want to address  those who complained about the lights on the cameras .You can turn them off in the software there are check boxes in the setaup area under advanced options . Actually in a store they work great becuase people who think their on camera are more honest if you can tell a employee what they were doing they will think twice about how they act too  . Now at home I wanted them hidden too as well as the camearas. You will have to be ingeneous and do some thinking as you need to keep them vented . The man that made bird houses and ran electric out in his yard thats great . What is poor about the system is you can only have 6 cameras and more is always better unless you dedicate another computer . Make sure your internet cables are buried and have at least PVC protection with some deterant protecting them from being easily cut too  . IF you use cameras  outside your home put cords up above sofits run back into buildings so they cant be unpluged easily by theives . It works . Its not cheap when you figure out what 4 cameras cost and that it works independant of a home alarm system however the main thing is it is easily doable and works very well over the net with no special programing . When the elderly widow on here told me she did this herself I have been ill and figured I could too . I did but it takes more then 15 minutes to set up unless your doing the indoor or spy cam out in the open inside . Don't forget to put social security numbers on your cameras just in case . The best cameras are placed with secure cords and locations . figure out a way to make them harder to detect or notice .Do try plugs before doing a full instal . I had no trouble positioning these myself .For msyelf at home I put some in . Cereal boxes with vent holes in the back and top and they work great inside or ? You just have to think . The easiest way for me to reset all the cameras is just turn off the main breaker inside the home . I am trying to figure out how to do this remotely incase I leave for long periods of time . Anyone have a clue  ? The computer is on a backup supply power so it wont hurt it and it came with reset software if that becomes necessary . I have remote internet control for my machine but keep it blocked most the time . Wilife on their site explains how you can do a bios change to power on the machine after a outage as your computer must be on for the system to work . I will add come back and write some more as time passes  . Hope this helps a little . They dont tell you but board camera lenses work on the indoor camears you can change them for different veiws see my review of their IR Illuminator  .

Some caveats", "Author": "Bob Feeser \"MillCrafters.com\"", "ReviewID": "R1L12N1J3GT5PX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second WiLife purchase. The WiLife system with indoor camera I have been using since the beginning of April. At that time I wrote a review, and some of this is derived from that. At the time I got the system, many people were reporting a problem with the transformers going while under the year warranty. I spoke with Logitech on the phone and they reported that they solved the transformer problem, and due to the reliable track record I have had since April 2nd, I have to agree with them. The old transformers that were shipped with the units were not sufficient for the demands of the system, so Logitech/WiLife has since upgraded them to a better unit.Another concern was that the cameras require a reboot after doing on online update through your computer. I updated right away the unit right out of the box, and no reboot of the camera was needed.Thirdly, those who are losing the camera signal, the software has an auto-detect single click feature. It disconnects, and then re-senses all of the cameras. It is like a refresh.One thing that is super important is that I could not detect the 2 cameras I had hooked up, and then I discovered the problem, I had the receiving unit, hooked up through the USB cable to the computer, and plugged directly into the AC, but in a surge suppressor; that is why it would not work. When I plugged it directly into the wall, it sensed them right away. They tell you to NOT plug cameras or the receiving unit into a surge suppressor. That is kind of un-nerving, considering I get lightning spikes in the summer, and this creates a direct line into the computer. Logitech states that they have their own surge suppressor already built into the units. They do not publish any kind of surge protection levels though, which I think would be a positive step toward a little hand holding.Some complained about cameras getting disconnected, and then having to reestablish the connection. I have not had such problems. As a matter of fact the new setup is receiving connections from the opposite end of a 60 foot house, through the standard electrical wiring system.I wish they had audio built in. My dream is to sit in front of the PC and if someone knocks on the door, click on the camera, and conduct a conversation; especially if it is all recorded.Having a motion sensor is great, and it automatically starts to record when someone even begins to approach the area. It is shocking but the motion sensor detects motion even before someone comes into viewing range.The camera does have a lagging time to readjust to changing lighting conditions. With a motion sensing light coming on, it took the camera 11 seconds to readjust so you could get a clear picture; that is too long for securing purposes at night time. They do have a night vision camera as an option which I do not have, so I cannot comment on it. Oddly enough the indoor secret camera that doubles as a clock when the light was switched off instead, it adjusted to the proper low light level in only 3 seconds. Hmmm.... how is that useful?My unit came with version 2.1 software, and I had upgraded to the 2.5 version already for my initial system. That brings up another cool thing, and that is that you can get 2 complete systems for not much more than just adding a second camera. The cameras are sending their signal and can be read by 2 receivers at the same time without any problems. They both record, provide live view etc. So why is that important? I have a 94 year old mother that I care for, and I placed the indoor camera number 2 in her bedroom. She loves to sleep in, so I can now be at either one of my PC's and periodically peek in on her without having to leave my chair. Not only can I do that, I also now can do that from either PC due to the fact that I have 2 complete systems, rather than one system plus a camera.Another concern I had was that this system should have its own PC to run on, so it wouldn't slow down my work machine. I have 1 Gig of ram, and this runs in the background, and I do not notice any performance drain. When you exit out of the program, it exits down to a little icon on the taskbar to the right, and only if you right click on the little camera icon, do you get the option to completely exit the program.I find the program to be very well designed. I navigate through it without having to figure anything out. It is all intuitive. If I click on a camera from within the 4 or 6 block grid, it automatically fills the screen. The list goes on; it doesn't need an instruction manual, that's how intuitive it is.The bottom line for me is that this provides the rest of us with a relatively inexpensive way to have a security system. Video quality is very good, especially when considering the quality of the video surveillance you see on TV when a store gets robbed.The internet access from any PC to observe any camera in your house or place of business is a big plus. You simply log into the web site, and view away.

This works well for some uses but not as well for others.  I would also not put this in a remote location where you don't go every few days or atleast are able to remote access (RDMPlus, LogMeIn, etc...) the computer if needed. (see below)For recording when your out or monitoring things when your there, it will \"record\" 10 out of 10 and the motion detection can really be tweaked making it work well after some adjustment.  The video quality is nice and you can tell what your looking at fine but your not going to be able to read license plates.  No problems always seems to work.For email alerts, it will \"email\" you 8/9 out of 10 so you will get most alerts.  The email has the time/date and gives you a picture or video clip and looks great.  Not a lot but every once in a while it will give you password or other errors for no reason after it was just working fine.  You need to restart the Command Center software. (reason for remote access or being able to get to the computer when needed)For online viewing, you can \"view online\" 7 out of 10 and when it works its nice but the problem is its hit or miss from my expereince.  I have to restart the software every few days to keep this working.  It still records and sends email alerts with pictures though so you can always check the recordings when you get home or with remote access.  (reason for remote access or being able to get to the computer when needed)  There are two different online viewing modes, direct and relay, if your computer supports direct you will get almost a live feed, if your computer does not support direct, then online viewing is delayed 2-3 minutes as it has to go thru Logitechs servers.Setup was very easy and only took minutes.  The thing that took longer was deciding where to put the camera(s) and adjusting all the settings.  Out of the box with no adjustments, the motion zone is full screen and anything and everything will set it off.  You will get email after email of nothing important until you adjust things.A few tips.  Its VERY important to clear the full screen zone that is the default and only select a smaller area that you really need.  Also to lower the movement sensitivity so you limit the number of false alarms.  Keep in mind shadows, tree branches, squirrels, birds, reflections off cars and so on can set off the motion detector so be selective and make the zones as small as possible to be useful.Another suggestion is to add a second monitor to a different location if you want.  For about $30 I bought a monitor splitter adapter and 50' extension cable and added a second monitor in my living room.  Now I don't have to go to the computer room every time I want to see something and can leave it on for live viewing as I am in the living room the most.Bottom line IMO.  This is really not a bad system for the low price.  I installed this Master System and 3 more cameras from Ebay for about the cost of the newer single camera Logitech Alert Master system and as long as you put it in a location you can reset it every now and then its fine.

I have serious trust issues and having to get a nanny was an unfortunate circumstance, but I knew I needed to get something to be able to monitor what goes on with the nanny and our daughter or I'd drive myself nuts thinking about it all day. This solution seemed to be the most convenient, user friendly, effective system on the market. After having used it for close to a year now, I think this was one of the smartest purchases I've ever made.The setup was ridiculously easy. The longest part was installing the software on my laptop and even that took at most 5 minutes (I work with computers so breezed through the installation...might take technophobes a little longer). Set up two cameras, one being in my daughter's room. After tinkering, I opted to buy the wide angle lens and was glad I did. With the wider radius, the camera sits on a built-in shelf and I can see the whole room.The features of the system are great. Being able to hook the camera into a powerline to access the home network is fantastic and negates the need to run reeeeeally long cables or buy access points. The quality of the video is pretty darn good (though I don't have experience with any other monitoring systems other than crappy black and white store monitoring systems). I can't make out the details of people's faces per se, but am able to clearly see who is who and what the who is doing. Playback of video is easy as you can easily adjust your video timeline scale, Also, active video recordings are represented in the timeline so you know exactly where to click to see a particular frame of recorded time. The big seller for me was being able to monitor the real-time feed (actually delayed 3 minutes unless you pay for the upgrade which I didn't) from the internet. I was even able to get the feed on my Motorola q9c though it's not without it's troubles.Recently, we went on a vacation and, of course, I was paranoid that our nanny has our keys and knows when we're gone, so I increased the sensitivity of the cameras to detect even the slightest motion and also set up the system to alert me via email and text message should any motion be detected. On the day we left, I set the timer on the system to arm itself after 30 minutes at which point it would start monitoring (otherwise it would ping me constantly as we moved about the house trying to get ready). All was silent until I received an alert on our 5th day of vacation. With sweaty palms I opened the email and opened the attached video (yes, it even sends a snippet of the recorded video) and saw that the sunlight, shining through the windows, was dancing on the far wall. I ended up very relieved and extremely impressed with the system!

I purchased it specifically because it was inexpensive, seemed easy to use, and required no installation. System has been running for a year now.  My office is a 90 year old home, formerly a duplex, with heaven knows how many kinks in the wiring, since we're constantly having to update it to carry computers and peripherals. We also have problems with power going down frequently in our area, since we're the last building on our local city power grid, as well as lightning strikes (highest point in the area), and power surges (see said city power grid....urgh...), and lord knows what else from the MARTA station and rail acrost the street and the military base next door. Whatever could possibly play havoc with our computers, has done so over the past thirty years. We've lost two routers and a workstation while we've had WiLife installed, but the WiLife equipment has had no trouble.Installation was fabulously easy, I mean, plug n' play easy. I LOVED that.I have two tips, though. First, our system kept going out and I'd have keep reinstalling it. Finally, called Logitech in a hissy fit, and the tech asked me if I was running it on a server, which I was. System is incompatible with a server, so I now run it on a workstation, and have had ZERO problem since then.  The other thing I might mention is that, if you have automatic updates set on your workstation, every time the system reboots, your WiLife system will cut off until reboot/password/etc is complete, then it automatically brings itself back up again. This has never been a problem until the past couple of months, when it seems like Microsoft has been sending security updates every bloody five minutes. So I disabled the automatic updates and run them once a week instead.I also like it that the video saves as small, individual files. If I have anything out of the ordinary, I copy and paste that file to a folder I've made up for reference, or a customer is hassling someone in the office, I copy and paste the file directly to their customer efile. Gee, I often wish it had sound. Maybe someday.....As far as picture quality....front office is just fine. We actually left our old disabled camera up on the ceiling, and only a couple of people have noticed that the real camera is actually the sleek, unobtrusive unit sitting on a window sill. Quality is pretty decent, and covers a good bit of our front office, since we have it sitting in a corner diagonal from the front door. Picture quality may not be HD, but it is 1,000% better than our old VCR system.My second indoor camera is mounted directly to the inside of a rear window, with a suction cup, and gives me a very decent view of my parking lot, without the hassle or wear & tear of mounting one outside.The only problem I have with a camera aimed out is, if it rains, the motion detector occasionally records raindrops rolling down the window. I am today ordering an LED motion detector light to put by the door so it will pick up anyone trying the back door, or hanging around it, as has happened several times lately. I am certain the LED light coming on will trigger the WiLife camera to come on, and hopefully be lit enough to pick up faces. This camera is in plain, plain view, btw, and not one customer has noticed it, because it is indoors!Rather than subscribing to WiLife's pay service, I use an app called Logmein.com to log in to my desktop occasionally to view activity on the computer, and can do so from my phone, iPad, or any computer, anywhere (LOVE this app, it is worth every nickle!!!!). I do not have it set up to contact me automatically, or it would drive me nuts, since it picks up quite a bit of activity on our busy corner.Be forewarned that units will pick up headlights going by, billboards lighting up and going off at night, and even the passage of sunbeams along the floor in an empty office. I have NO problem with this. It doesn't take up much space on my hard drive (you can set it to record over and over on the allotted memory, which is a nice feature, since you don't have to deal with manually cleaning it)and I like to see everything that goes on. I have it set on \"medium\" sensitivity and the most frames per second.Logitech has since come out with a newer system that records to a chip directly in the camera. I am in two minds about this. At least with the one I have, I can view and adjust the camera very easily, but it would be nice to have the data recorded elsewhere. And, of course, since I don't subscribe to their backup service, if someone steals my desktop, but we mainly have it running for safety of personnell, rather than burglaries.Finding the clip I want on their software is quite easy, as LONG as I have a general idea of the time I want. I have often gone back after a long weekend, to view people hanging around in our parking lot, when tenants living next door have mentioned unusual activity. It only takes a few minutes, since everything is sequential. You can scroll back using a slider/clock combination,or hit a specific date on a calendar to go back quickly.For the price I paid for this system, this review cannot glow enough.oh, and once a month they send an email of \"Winning Videos\" users submit, having caught people or animals in the act, and I have to (embarrassedly) say, I look forward to them.

This was easy for the indoor camera, but a bit more complicated for the outdoor camera. I did have an outdoor power outlet near the location I wanted to place the outdoor camera, however when plugged into this outlet the camera would only get a bad connection, or no connection. (Remember these camera's use your housed electrical wiring to make their connection to your PC). To make a long story short, I had to run an extension cord from an outlet inside my house to the outdoor camera. Not ideal, and it still only gets a \"poor connection\". This seems to cause about a 1 minute lag between something moving in front of the camera, and it actually being viewed at the PC.My second problem is while researching this system, I read one of the benefits was that if you sign up for the \"platinum\" service, your video can be stored on the WiLife server. I thought this was great, because if thieves break in and steal your computer, you will still have the video that is stored online. Well no, the video can be stored online, but you have to manually upload it. This does no good if your computer is stolen,as obviously you have no video to upload. I was quite dissappointed with this, especially after having spent the extra $80.00 to sign up for the platinum service.Finally, my last problem is that there is not really a separate \"recording and alerting\" schedule for each camera as advertised. There is only one schedule for all camera's. There are options to turn off some camera's during a scheduled event and so forth, but I could not really set up the recording and alerting schedule that I actually wanted, as I would have been able to do if there were actually completely different schedulers for each camera.Other than those things the system seems to work fine.

Lerch", "ReviewID": "RTGYTVBBWF7OF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently had my house broken into. In order to have piece of mind again, I chose to have a security system installed and opted to setup my own video surveillance system. After some investigation and research, I found the Wi Life options from Logitech and opted for this.First the pros:Easy to setup - all you need to do is plug the camera into your wall outlet (this includes the outdoor system), install the software on the PC you wish to use, plug the other USB adapter into the wall near your PC and plug the USB cord coming from this wall adapter into your PC. The Wi Life software will walk you through the entire setup so it's painlessNo cords to run - unlike other systems where you may have to run both a video cord and a power cord, this uses your home electrical wiring as a type of network. All you need to do is plug it into an outlet and you're ready to go. (yes, on some stand alone systems you have power and video from one cable, but you must still run the cabling through your house)Software is simple to use - the software is simple to setup and simple to use. You can copy events, as recorded events are called, to USB stick, CD, DVD or whatever medium you want to easily hand over to law enforcement. You don't have any VHS tapes or DVD-Rs to look through; you open the software, open the viewer, locate the time you wish to view then save it to an external device. Since it uses the Windows Media Video format, any PC should be able to view the video you produceAnd now for the cons:Reuires a pretty powerful PC for more than a few cameras - one thing the box doesn't really go into too much detail about are the PC requirements. For a single camera or 2, this system needs a very basic PC. If you wish to have the maximum amount of cameras in use, that being 6, you will need a PC with a ton of RAM and a really fast processor. Part of the reason for the need for a more powerful PC was Logitech's decision to use WMV (Windows Media Video) for encoding the recorded video.PC must be on all the time - For those wanting to conserve power, this is NOT the option to use. You must have your PC on all the time for recording surveillance. You can chose to turn your PC on and off when you wish to record, but this doesn't change the fact that power consumption from this device, compared to stand alone devices, will be more.Video quality - you can only get up to 15 fps (frames per second) on this. Some stand alone systems can get you 30 fps, and on the more expensive models you can get as high as 60 fps. The higher the fps, the smoother the recorded video and the easier to get facial details and so on of those perpetrating crimes against you.Limited to only 6 cameras - since this offering uses a PC, I had hoped to remove the limitation on the amount of cameras you use. Most stand alone systems I've seen allow for only up to 4-8 cameras (more cameras = higher starting costs). The limitation, it seems, is with Logitech choosing to use a PC as it's recorder. The smaller single function devices are designed to do a single type of function so they are more efficient and can handle larger loads.If you need a new PC, you're adding to the cost of the system - so if you have a PC you already leave on all the time, you're set. If not, or you wish to use your PC for other things and not mess around with the surveillance PC, expect to add anywhere from $300-$2000 to your start up costs. For the cost of the master system and a $300 PC, you can purchase yourself a decent 4 camera stand alone system. Add on 3 more Wi Life cameras at $200 each and the cost comparison becomes a no brainer. The Wi Life would run you ~$900, plus a $300 PC (possibly more, since with 4 cameras you need quite a nice PC), that's $1200. A stand alone system will run you $800 with 4 cameras. The only down side to the stand alone is the need to run cabling.One thing to note is that you must purchase ONE master system per surveillance system you wish to use. Once you have the master system (indoor, outdoor or concealed in a clock), you can quickly and easily upgrade your system with the Wi Life cameras (indoor, outdoor or concealed in a clock) without the need for another master system.In the end, I went with the Wi Life. The start up costs, compared to stand alone systems, was a lot cheaper. The least expensive system I found was roughly $800. I needed something quickly and less expensively than that, so I went with 2 Wi Life cameras. I had a spare, semi-powerful laptop that I had access to, so I didn't need to spend money on another PC. Factoring in the additional cost of a PC, you are much better off going with a stand alone system and running a cable (many stand alone systems let you run a single cable from the DVR (recording) device to the camera through which it supplies electricity and the video data).I am happy with what I've received.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect video security system - everything easy as advertised", "Author": "Technophobe I am", "ReviewID": "R30JVI6NKPRX5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Indoor Master System Camera by Logitech was just as easy to set up as advertised for a beginner-intermediate technophile/technophobe.

I received it, took about 20 minutes to set it up, and the camera's working right now and I'll definitely add more indoor cameras and possibly outdoor cameras.  The camera automatically records to your computer when it senses motion and you can add additional schedules for recording.  The only draw-back is the lack of infrared if you're using this as security at night.  I'll have to add adjustments for that (motion sensor lights), but it's an awesome system otherwise.  While the system can't be plugged into extension strips with surge-protectors (they're already built-in to the components), you can use regular extension cords to lengthen the range of where you place the camera (same with the computer you use to plug the whole system in - I'm using a laptop right now with an extension cord because the Logitech cord is really short).  There are several different mounting systems for the camera (easy-to-attach suction can be placed on either side of the camera for looking out of the window and looking in from the window, there are wall and ceiling brackets, or a stand-alone desk holder).  I had purchased another similarly-priced security camera that had to be routed to the computer in a more convoluted way, but this is a system that is much simpler in that it uses plug-in receivers and immediately connects camera to computer through electrical outlets. It also allows you to remotely view what's occurring via the web and sends alerts (something I haven't had time to try).  The only small nit I have are the stickers that accompany the system - they show an icon of the outdoor camera that's not really a clear sign of surveillance or video security.  I thought the stickers should mention the words \"video security\" or something a little clearer.  Amazon.com shipped it really quickly and I'm just really pleased with every aspect of this purchase.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A good value for the price", "Author": "O. Lerma \"StratPlaya\"", "ReviewID": "R39KFACPN213JT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thus far I'm pretty impressed with this security system.  The cost is relatively low, setup is easy and the software offers many options for recording, viewing and notifications.  The video signal travels through the electrical wiring in your house so there is no need to run additional cables for the video.  You just need a standard electrical outlet.  Also, you can't connect the camera to a surge protector due to the filters built into those devices.  I haven't had to contact support so I can't comment on that part.Pros:- Fairly low cost- Easy setup with good well written instructions.- Good software with many options but still easy to use.- Able to monitor from any computer with an Internet connection.- Good video quality in good light.Cons:- Poor low light performance.  Hard to ID even cars that pass under a bright street light by our home.- Frame frame drops in low light.  The normal frame rate I set is 15fps.  This seems to drop to about 5fps in low light.This could be a great system but they need to improve the low light capabilities", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works great, online viewing is cool...", "Author": "Juniorverse1", "ReviewID": "R9T6KZDJ5LTLR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*Hint*... Before installing using the CD this product comes with, go to wilife.com and download the latest version instead.I really like this product.  I've tried some of the X-10 garbage over the years, but never had a very favorable opinion of anything I received from them... especially with their software.  The Logitech WiLife software is another story though.  It's professionally done, and comes with cool features like the ability to define motion detection zones and sensitivity.  Oh, and it works right out of the box (after some automatic configuration that takes 5 minutes or so).The image from the camera appeared strange at first.  But since I agreed to \"automatically check for updates\" during setup, it quickly discovered new firmware that was available for the camera.  I told it to update and it did so without any problems.  When the camera came back on, the image was a lot better.  Awesome!There are so many features that the software provides, like the ability to send e-mail or phone alerts when motion is detected.  And of course the coolest thing is being able to view the video from a remote location using the internet (you must sign up for a free WiLife account first).  Don't expect real-time viewing over the web though: the video you are viewing online is usually from 30 seconds to a minute ago... no big deal.This camera also comes with a nice variety of mounting options for standing up on a desk, mounting to a wall, or mounting to a window.  It appears that a lot of thought went in to the design of this thing and it wasn't just slapped together to get a product out.The one thing I was disappointed with was all the \"upgrade to the Platinum edition so you can do this and this\" nonsense all over the software.  You're first encounter is at the very first startup of the program, when a \"Helpful Tips\" window opens and tells you all the things you can do if you had the Platinum version (before you even get to see what you can do with what you already have)!  Then there are a bunch of buttons on the screen for digital panning and zooming, etc that are for Platinum users only.  It's a bit obnoxious if you spend a lot of money for a system and they bombard you with \"yeah, but give us more money and you can have this and this\".  Why not offer a 6-month free trial of the Platinum features included in the somewhat high price of this product?!Platinum complaint aside, this really is a nice product, and the software is far from the garbage you get with other products like X-10.  I may just have to get one of the outdoor cameras and an infrared add-on.  :)", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great security system option under $500", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R26HV3YPEAWHS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Note: As far as I can tell, this is the exact same system as the Wilife DVS800I LukWerks Indoor Starter Kit.  The only difference I could see is that one is the banding on the camera, as well as a different software version.  I had them both setup and they are interchangeable.I've used several cameras in the last few years in an attempt to come up with some type of cheap home security system. After trying out the Wilife system, I have to say that it's the best option I've come across under the $500 range. The video quality is excellent, and the best part is, the motion detector on the camera works perfectly, even through windows, which most of the other cameras I've used can't handle. Setup took less than 20 minutes and I didn't have to deal with port forwarding or spend hours trying to configure my router to get it to work. I was also able to view the camera online very easily from a remote location.My only problem with the camera is that the actual camera is way too big and bulky in my opinion, and I didn't really like the mounting options. I wanted to put one of the cameras in my ceiling and angle it through a hole in the ceiling so it was undetectable, but the unit is so big that is impossible.

Bryant", "ReviewID": "R1UMHUFXDXQPSC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Dogs are wonderful prognosticators when it comes to an impending knock on the door.  Their only shortcoming on this front, really, is that they are limited in their ability to let you know who approaches.  I've often been at work in some part of the house, typing away on my laptop, only to have a knock at the door derail my train of thought.  Is it a delivery person dropping off a parcel?  Perhaps a neighbor with a particular need or request, maybe it's a local kid selling for some fund raiser.  I want to answer these knocks.  But the carpet cleaning service trying to drum up business, or the friendly but somewhat sinister old ladies trying to sell their own version of the afterlife to me, or the relatively creepy guy that wants to sell frozen meat from the back of his shabby non-descript truck?  I mean, sometimes I just have better things to do.I've wanted a camera system for a number of years.  It's one of those things where I would do some internet searches, read some reviews, browse around here on Amazon - but never saw the right time to take a leap.  I wanted something that would integrate with my home network.  I didn't just want a little dedicated monitor somewhere hooked up to a VCR, I wanted to be able to access the feed from any of my home computers, and ideally, over the internet.  I didn't want to pay a monthly service fee, I wanted a range of camera options that included interior, exterior, and ideally some ability to see in the dark.  Most of all, I wanted something that would be well designed and reliable.  Wilife seemed to meet all of these requirements, so when the opportunity to try it out presented itself, I finally took the leap.Things seemed to go pretty smoothly right out of the box.  I mounted the camera with the provided suction cup on to a front facing window (ultimately I'd end up using the supplied hard mount to fix a better angle), ran the cable from that down to the supplied adapter set into a nearby outlet.  By my desktop which serves as a print and file server for the other laptops, I plugged in the other wall outlet, and ran the USB cable provided from that to the computer.  After installing the software and registering for the free online access to the feeds, it did a quick search, and suddenly I had a live view of my front yard before me on the monitor.  I tweaked a few settings (went up to the maximum 15fps setting, and the highest resolution at 640x480), turned the lens just a bit to provide sharper focus, and everything looked terrific.The Wilife control panel allows you to adjust recording sensitivity.  Out of the box, when someone walked down the sidewalk on the other side of the street, it didn't record.  Just to test it, I pulled the slider to the top of the 100 point scale.  Now it would record when birds flew by.  I took it down to the bottom, and even cars passing on the street didn't trigger it.  I left it around 65 ultimately, which would pick up people or animal movement in my front yard, cars in the street, but not much else across the street.  I found the slider to have a full range of sensitivity, rather than the \"all or nothing\" I've read about with similar products.We were delighted, everything seemed to be fine, right up until I needed to send a document to the shared printer.  No dice.  When you plug everything in, a new network connection is created on your computer.  All the data is passing through your electrical wires, which is why you can't plug the adapters into surge protectors and the like.  Then it comes out through the outlet, passes through the USB cable into your computer, all within its own little network with its own IP address range.  For 99% of those who buy and use this product, I think that's all going to work brilliantly.  My network setup is a little more complicated.  This desktop already had 3 adapters.  Two wired, one wireless.  Two networks converged at this point, one providing internet access.  For whatever reason, the presence of the new USB adapter was preventing other computers in the same workgroup from accessing the shared resources.  I contacted tech support over email, sent them diagnostics generated from the Wilife control center, and we tried disabling a variety of things that could have been interfering.  After not having any luck in that direction, they sent me an ethernet bridge.  During this time I could either have my camera up, or shared resource access to that machine - but not both.  Upon receipt (which was literally the next day in this case), I disconnected the USB cable from the desktop and the plug to which it was connected.  I plugged in the new adapter, and ran a standard network cable from it to my router.  Instantly the camera came back to life, and we discovered that we could once again access the shared resources on the desktop.  Problem fixed by the responsive, friendly, and entirely thorough staff - a wholly positive tech support experience that, quite frankly, I'm just not accustomed to.  As the old saying goes though; your mileage may vary.The same holds true depending on the relative power and speed of the computer you intend to run the control center on.  Handling a 640x480 video stream at 15fps can task some older computers.  Multiply that out across a few cameras, add the recording function which goes on and off dynamically (and/or by a scheduler you set), and you're apt at some point to start seeing some stutters on the live playback.  I can't speak to anyone else's system but my own, but on a two or three year old desktop running an AMD64 processor at 2.2GHz with 1GB of RAM, the only time I notice a hiccup on live playback is when the recorder is kicking in, and I don't see the same when I review the recorded output.  I'm at the highest possible visual quality settings, I imagine if I went up to 3 or 4 cameras, I might have to bring the settings down a bit -- but for the time being, it's smooth sailing even while that machine also streams audio out to the Logitech Squeezebox Duet Network Music System, handles regular and generally large print queues, as well as limited browser function.Since installing this system, this camera caught damage happening to a package which might have otherwise represented a difficult dispute, caught some local kids setting fire to a few bags of lawn waste (odd one, that), and gives us advance warning whenever something is about to be delivered, or a guest is approaching otherwise unannounced.

I thought since these were on sale from being discontinued I'd give it a try but was sorely disappointed with how it functions. I continually lost connection or never could establish a connection in the first place. I have a very new house, less than 5 years old, so all the wiring is in great shape. Even on the same segment I couldn't maintain a reliable connection. With 15+ years of working in the IT industry I have a fair bit of confidence in what I was doing.The camera itself is quite decent for what it does. The focusing is easy to get to and the lens direction being controlled via a small ball on the back of the camera is a brilliant little idea I think. The ability to hang it looking out a window or into a room via the attached suction cup is also a nice touch and I'm disheartened that no one else has a design similar to this.The software that logitech bundles is ok at best. The idea that I \"HAVE\" to use their servers to retrieve any usable images or video is ridiculous. The option to run a tiny web server from a machine in my home is very simple to do and the option should at least have been included. I personally am using Blue Iris software for my video recording and this camera, when it would connect, worked very well in that.Logitech does have an upgraded version of this camera but I've not used it yet. I may within the year and will post an updated review for it when/if I do.I had hoped that the camera would work with POE (power over ethernet) but sadly it does not.

I watched the video, 1-2-3 steps and you're done, at least, that is how it should work but this is how it goes. (1) Ordered the Master System (MS), 1 camera (cam#1)+ power supply, disk & a power supply for your computer/laptop, which by the way, must be running 24/7 for this system to work. I suggest using an older (unused) model since most of us update our computer/laptop & usually end up with a spare.(2) While I was waiting for my MS to arrive, I found an add-on camera (cam#2) at a good price so I ordered it. Both the MS & cam#2 arrived the same day. I noticed the power supply for cam#2 was different than what came with the MS cam#1, newer maybe? I hooked everything up according to the disk (which is easy) but cam#1  came on-line for 5 minutes and shut off, although cam#2 worked fine!(3) I sent cam#1 back and the dealer sent me a replacement, now cam#3. I followed the same troubleshooting recommended by Logitech but to no avail.(4) I held onto cam#3 and the dealer sent another replacement cam#4. With all 3 cameras hooked up I once again sent the software to recognize them. It came back with cam#1 (old faithful) and now cam#3! BUT, like cam#1, cam#3 came to life for only 3 minutes and bailed. I reset the cameras (except cam#1), cam#3 is dead but finally cam#4 comes alive!(5) Over the weekend I made sure the MS maintained contact with cam#1 & cam#4 and it has.(6) Now the only drawback is the MS will go offline every other day so you must reboot the MS if you want to view your security cameras over the internet. This babysitting is not the 1-2-3 then leave it alone system I was hoping for.SOOO, I ordered the HooToo Wifi IP Wireless Pan/Tilt camera so I don't have to run another laptop and I don't have to reboot daily.

Unfortunately, the iSight doesn't record video well at night.I ordered this and the WiLife IR-50 Illuminator Kit.  Setup was quick and easy.  I just followed the directions for both the Master System and the Illuminator.  After the quick interchange of lenses required by the WiLife IR-50 Illuminator Kit, I was up and running recording video at night.  The night vision is ok, but not extremely powerful.  I suggest you install additional lighting outside, such as a porch light or motion-detected flood light.  I have both of these additional light sources and only get ok results outside at night.  That said, the quality is good enough if needed as evidence of vandalism in my opinion.My two wishes are stronger night vision and the ability to adjust the recording interval.  Let me be clear here: you can schedule times for recording video and that works fine.  I am not using it though because I am using motion-detected recording.  What I am asking for is the ability to record a certain amount of time after motion is detected.  For instance, I want to be able to record continuous video for up to one minute after the initial motion is detected.  The software seems to be hard-coded to record only during the motion.  The problem here is that, even at the highest sensitivity, it doesn't always catch the motion.  If it allowed a minute of continuous recording, it would catch all the motion.  EvoCam allows this granularity.Other than that, I find this to be a mostly reliable and inexpensive system.

You have to upgrade to premium plan at $80 year to get that basic function. I found that ridiculous.I could not get email alerts to go to my own domain mail server.  I finally managed to get it to work with gmail.The alerts mechanism is odd.  I cannot figure out how to get it to send video clips over email during a motion sense.Overall, easy to setup, but the remote control and email config are very bad.  I may send this back after a few unsuccessful more attempts.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nightmare product...would rather have my stuff stolen.", "Author": "Jamie Voss", "ReviewID": "R2YFVJR1ZGWOUL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "$500 spent on master system and two outdoor cameras...PLUS $800+ on electrician + time wasted mounting the outdoor cameras = terrible.Initially, I was pleased with this product...My main PC is in my basement.  I plugged the USB Adapter and outdoor camera into my wall outlet.  System worked great!  BUT, once I tried plugging the camera in to an outlet on the second story of our home (USB adapter still in the basement to hook up to my PC) I had very bad results.  The system could not recognize my camera.  I tried nearly every outlet in my home with varying success.  I eventually called my electrician.  He tried wiring the second story outlet directly to my basement outlet.  No dice.  His opinion was that the wiring in my house was too old (read aluminum wiring vs. copper) so he installed a completely new outlet on the exterior of my home on the second floor.  This worked for about 16 hours (with poor camera connection as stated by the software's camera diagnostics), and since then my cameras get knocked offline constantly.  I checked the wiring of my outlets/breaker box and found mostly copper wiring, which doesn't jibe with my electrician's opinion as stated earlier.  Needless to say, I'm returning my products tomorrow.  Also, tried to contact Logitech's tech support via email with a promised reply within 24 hours.  It has been 36 hours.At least I now have an exterior outlet on the second story of my house for Christmas lights!  Thanks for nothing, Logitech!", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY OUT SIDE CAMERAS", "Author": "Dr. Harold Osborne \"hw\"", "ReviewID": "R1TJNSB2DO5QFH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I HAVE GONE THROUGH 5 CAMERAS IN LESS THEN 2 YEARSAFTER THEY REPLACE ONE CAMERA THEY WILL NOT REPLACE ANYMORE THE LAST ONE SENT ELECTRIC SHOCK THROUGH ME WHEN REPLUGING IN AS THEY STATE TO RECHARGE THE CAMERA THE CAMERA WAS SENT BACK BAD SHORT", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R1Z2K3FWLXZSRK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM!!!
