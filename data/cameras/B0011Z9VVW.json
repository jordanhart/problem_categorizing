I make reviews when I am especially disappointed, or when I'm really really happy about something.  This the best camera I have ever used.  I love this camera!  The wide angle is really appreciated.  You can get the shot you want every time.  Nice bright screen, with super-handy controls for common things like Timer Mode, Exposure, Flash on/off and Macro mode.  The power switch is never hit by accident.  The menus are fast and very well laid out.  Picture quality is excellent.  This camera has fast startup, 2.5 seconds after hitting the power switch, you are ready to take pictures.  In addition, the image processing runs very fast, and your picture is ready for viewing so quickly that it is ready by the time you have a chance to put the switch in play mode.  The camera is very small and light, which is amazing considering how much of it must be dedicated to the Leica lens and the optical zoom mechanicals.  The on/off switch, mode selection and the quick menu buttons are a joy to use, very positive action with tactile feedback.  Very well organized layout, making the common settings like flash/on/off/auto, and exposure control very easy to get to.  Macro mode works down to 5 cm.  The camera makes good choices for exposure while in general purpose mode.  However, you have lots of good choices for white balance and exposure control if you don't like the default.  You can even point the camera at something white and get a custom white balance to make the pictures look correct no matter what the lighting is.  Battery life is excellent, I've taken hundreds of pictures and only recharged once.  The display is nice and bright, outdoor use works well unless the sun is directly shining on the LCD.  The only thing I don't like about is all these silly modes you can put it in like 'Baby1' and 'Baby2'.  Do you really need a separate camera mode for baby pictures?  These modes go on and on, and it seems kind of nuts to me.  However, these can be ignored easily.  My family has late-model Nikon and Cannon Cameras.  I wanted a wider-angle camera and this is the one I chose, after reading some positive comments on Trusted Reviews.  This camera is better than the Nikons and Cannons in almost every way.  If you are deciding between this camera and different one, chose this one, it is a truly exceptional device.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "great camera, except for the compression", "Author": "time photographer", "ReviewID": "R2HQRRY3COKDPD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great Camera!!! The controls are in the right place, and work great.  Quick and easy to switch to movie mode. Instead of a push button to turn camera on/off, it has a switch that clicks left or right.  Its much better, doesn't get accidentally pushed by someone taking a picture for you or when you pass the camera to someone to show them slides.  The same is true for the take/view pictures switch.  its a great camera. EXCEPT IT HAS A PROBLEM WITH IMAGE QUALITY!!!  The low quality mode is fine, and the images show a lot of compression if you zoom way in.  In high quality mode the file sizes of the images double, but the compression is still there just as bad as low quality mode!  Something wrong in the programming!  In the end, the images are such high resolution, that I really diont mind the compression.  Its not horrible.  I just keep it in the low quality mode, and things look great for my purposes.  Im a professional photographer by the way, and this is my fun camera.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "By far the best camera I've found", "Author": "J. MacDonald", "ReviewID": "R9I6KUE8FQLY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of cross-shopping, asking of friends, reading articles, etc., and I've owned a lot of digital cameras.  In short, the lens is great, the picture quality is fantastic (both in resolution (10MP) and the actual image quality itself, due to the lens, processing, etc.)  The video mode is very, very good (the best I've found in digital cameras even in the $700 range) especially when you shoot in HD resolution (1280x720, which is 720p HD).  My friends are blown away by the video quality.  Fast startup speed, great layout, very very long battery life.  Nothing but good things to say about this camera.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Porch Pup", "Author": "J.

I had always liked Canon/Nikon digital cameras because of their size and quality but the Panasonic is ever bit as good and the extra advantage of the wide angle lens is the selling point.  I can't fault the pictures I get from it and I know it will fill a spot when we take trips.", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Thomas Migiel", "ReviewID": "R3ESEKN1DIX6LR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really love this camera.

The menu system is intuitive and most controls can be accessed with fewer than 3 clicks.  As with all P&S; cameras, higher ISOs are completely unusable, but that is to be expected.  The OIS in this camera is world class and you can get usable images with shutter speeds as slow as 1 second at the wide end of the zoom", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "RCKVODCP74XD2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tiny but a real workhorse - the wide angle is great for travel photgraphy - very good pictures for a compact camera", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera.", "Author": "Bob B Thompson \"37\"", "ReviewID": "R3NWA0XUHS6VNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the wide angle feature of this camera.
