One of the few point and shoot camera's that will allow you to zoom in and out while shooting 720P video.  I used to buy Canon camera's exclusively, but I wanted to start shooting quick video clips of my kids, so I was specifically looking for a great point and shoot that takes acceptable video.  I shoot video when something is happening, which usually means you would like to zoom to keep the action in frame.  Takes great quality pictures.  4.6 optical zoom is also above average for this price point.  Great for super close ups as well.Have been extremely happy with this camera, once I sent the first one back to J&R; due to a spec of dust internal to the camera.

Everything was there.( also bought extra memory and battery)It was supposed to be used, but I couldn't tell; looks brand new to me: in the original box and packing.Took a bunch of pics and video in several modes and environments.I expected the pic to be really good and they were. In fact, even better than I expected. I don't expect to take much video with it, but I tested it anyway. Wow! Did not expect the video to be so great. I cant believe these little pocket point and shoots have this kind of picture and video quality.  Camera, extra battery and 8GB of extra memory for $200. I took the free shipping. Took like 6 days to get to me, I was in no rush. I'm happy.I am now a fan of Canon and Panasonic. Also, if you don't take much video,only pics, 8GB memeory card  is over kill.

We were so happy with the sd750 that I gave canon another chance.  Well I must have had a defective unit because I shot pictures on auto and they all came out yellow and blurry, I returned it and after coming to amazon and reading reviews (fun and addictive) I thought I would give Lumix a try.  I was looking for #1 clear pictures and #2 fast shooting. (taking lots of pictures of kids and have to focus and shoot fast even indoors)Well I got it from Discountjungle through amazon and the shipping was VERY FASTIt is the fastest point and shoot I've tried compared to other canon point and shoot cameras I've owned.The picture clarity is very good.  I'd say at least 95% as good if not equal to our old canon sd750.  Taking pictures indoors and in darker rooms indoors the pictures came out very good!The construction sees solid and it weighs more than I thought it would.The camera is very responsive.  I'd say at least twice as fast as my last Canon.Unlike what another reviewer stated you CAN zoom in and move around the pictures while in view mode.  Just use the zoom toggle to zoom in and use the 4 directional buttons to move around on the picture.I was also concerned where the placement of the lens was due to reading other reviews, but I'm right handed and it hasn't been a problem at all.  In fact, what they didn't say was, the placement of the flash is perfect being in the middle because on my old canon the flash would sometimes get covered my my hand causing less effective flash.This camera has made me want to try a higher end Lumix that may give me even better images but this one is the perfect fit for what I was looking for.  Like another reviewer stated in there review about one of the Lumix cameras, using auto setting, the camera won't let you take a bad picture LOL, after owning Canons and having to wait for the pre focus etc, I know what they were talking about now.  The Canons would take great pictures if you would hold the button down 1/2 way and wait for the camera to focus etc before pressing fully, and I didn't have a problem with this, but my wife never got the hang of it.  So ~20% or so of the pictures she took would have problems because she hurried the camera.

All of the photos taken with this camera were poor quality. I was quite surprised given all the positive reviews. I took two dozen pictures in different lighting conditions, indoor and out in automatic mode. When I loaded them on my laptop all of the pictures looked washed out. There was a fuzziness about them. The colors just seemed bland to me. So I pulled up some pictures from my older Kodak V550 (5MP) and these pictures had vivid colors and a crispness. Well to validate my thoughts further I borrowed a Sony compact point and shoot from a friend and took the cameras on a stroll and took indoor and outdoor pictures of the same scene with each of the them. I did this at dusk and again at full day light with both cameras set in the full automatic mode. Comparing the pictures side by side on the same laptop there was an absolute clear difference in the quality of the pictures. The Lumix FP8 pictures were washed out, reds and blues looked dull and faded. With the Sony the colors were bright, vivid, and photos were clear and had a nice pop to them. I changed some of the settings on the Lumix especially the one that turned \"vivid\" on. This did not help. Some other things I learned with the Lumix are that 12 mega pixels probably don't buy you anything maybe unless you want to print large 10X12 pictures. Also, I was intrigued that this camera had HD video. But what I realized after shooting several 30 second clips is that the HD video mode eats a lot of hard  drive space and since the files are so large it takes a lot longer to transfer them  to the HD drive. I switched the video mode to VGA and found that for my purposes the playback on a PC was the same quality as in HD mode and the files size was 70% smaller. I returned the Lumix FP8 today and decided to go with the Cannon SD1200IS which is an older model with 10MP and VGA video. Look at the 500 plus reviews and 99% of them rave about the picture quality. I will update this review when I receive the Cannon and compare photos.I received the Canon SD1200IS. I did the same comparison picture quality test.

So I thought I'd contribute back to the Amazon customer review ecosystem and add my two cents.  As quickie background, I am not a professional photographer.  I wanted a simple, inexpensive PandS for quick shots in the office and while traveling.  My family and I have a better digital still camera that we use for \"important\" photos.I paid the Amazon price you're probably seeing on this page, and my rating takes that heavily into account.  I don't like this camera's construction quality, I think its form factor is problematic, and the picture quality is barely acceptable.  With a slam like that, you'd think I'd have given this product one star, but for [...], well, you get what you pay for.More details on my negatives...Build quality:  This thing feels almost like a high-end children's toy.  I've had Canon digital ELPHs, a Nikon, and another higher-priced Panasonic Lumix and they all felt stronger and tighter.  Metal and higher-quality plastics, better fitting and pressing and sliding.  \"Made in China\" (of course, at this price point) usually means lower quality construction and this camera really shows it.  If you've used a Made in Japan Canon PandS, for example, you can tell the difference immediately.  I am afraid this camera is going to fall apart in a year.Form factor:  It's convenient that the lens doesn't extend and retract.  Flush front surface, no moving parts, no motor-y noise -- that's all good.  But the lens hole is in the upper right corner of the front of the camera and when you hold it to take a picture, you are almost always covering the lens.  Other reviewers have noted this and it's a problem because your natural tendency is to hold the camera that way.Picture quality:  This is the worst part of this camera.  I've read all the various reviewers' advice and guidance about changing settings to get the best pictures, but I'm not happy with the quality of the pics I'm getting from the FP8.  I have taken essentially the same photos in the same conditions with my other PandS cameras (all on the easy auto setting) and they are all better.  Of course, all the PandS cameras I'm refering to cost quite a bit more than this Lumix.  I assume they have better chips and/or better lenses than this camera.So, as I said, it's about price-to-quality.  For about [...], I'm giving the Panasonic Lumix FP8 a passing grade.

I have just returned from vacation where I took hundreds of pictures and I am very happy with the photo quality.  I think my Cybershot took better pictures with the flash off, but other than that I cannot complain.  There are still alot of features that I have not tried yet...I'm pretty much a point-and-shoot kind of girl!I would highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful camera", "Author": "Richard H.

For the most part I'm happy with it since it wasn't expensive and it's easy to pull out of a pocket and take a picture. The energy save feature keeps it in a \"sleep\" mode, that makes waking it to take a snap much faster than having to turn it all the way on from a full \"off\" mode. The lens in the upper corner does take some adjusting to, to avoid putting one's fingers in all the shots, but overall, I like the look of the camera and I like the look of the snaps.

You can't choose to delete it while it's showing you the preview.  I've found it powered on while in my purse, so the power switch is a little too easy to knock on.  When the camera is on it shows the date but when you get the pictures printed the date isn't on there.  I haven't yet found how to fix that.It has some nice features but it's not user friendly, so you can't just play with it and figure out how to access the features; really have to learn it and work with it.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Muy linda y pr\u00e1ctica cam!", "Author": "Agustin Suarez \"Guga10\"", "ReviewID": "R14O73X9LN9BB3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El precio es muy bueno.
