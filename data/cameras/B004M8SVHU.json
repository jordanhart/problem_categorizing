Although there are a few flaws, the camera's features make up for them. Below are the major pros and cons I found after using the camera for a few hours.Pros:- HUGE 36x Optical Zoom (at full zoom I could see buildings 5 miles away as if they were two blocks away)- Relatively lightweight and compact, much smaller than I expected.(compared to an entry level DSLR)- Up to 240 FPS video, nice slow motion.- Manual controls, a must for any experienced camera user.- Buttons well laid out and simple to find and use.Cons:- Image quality was good but it was pretty much expected, nothing extraordinary for this price range. If you prefer higher quality images over features in this price range, an entry level DSLR such as the D3100 is the way to go.- If you accidentally leave the lens cap on and turn the camera on, the lens will still try to come out and it will grind the motor. BE CAREFUL! I found this to be the biggest flaw, not having a \"lens cap on\" sensor or a resistance sensor that would stop the motor if it sensed something in the way.- No supplied external battery charger. You have to charge the battery while it's in the camera, via USB cable and supplied AC adapter. And while it's charging, it won't let you power it on, so you can't use it as an AC power source either.- As with all super high zooms, every tiny vibration is magnified so unless you have a tripod or some kind or support, it's extremely difficult to get a clear shot at maximum zoom.All in all, it is very user friendly. From the novice photographer to the experienced photo geek, the features on this camera are sure to impress. If you can deal with a few minor inconveniences, the Nikon Coolpix P500 is pretty nice camera.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Alaska trip under my belt and it did everything I asked.", "Author": "Millersdad", "ReviewID": "R3D4570G5BYDZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just returned from the holidays that I got the camera for.  14 days in Alaska.  The camera did nearly everything I asked of it.  A couple points I would like to point out.  *I used firmware version 1.0 while on holiday, I now see version 1.1 is out, but does not appear to address any of the points I had issue with*I got to work with the video more, and I had very bad luck getting it to focus.  However I did notice if I ran the zoom out and THEN turned on the video, it seemed to be able to grab focus on the subjects much better.  Again, doesn't make sense to me, but I will be interested in others that try it and if they have the same experience.  I met several folks both traveling with us and at the places I visited that own the P500. Shared experiences with others and got some slick pointers from some too.  Almost to the person the folks I interacted with were pleased to very pleased with this camera.  Yes, we all shared some of the same gripes.  One of the universal ones was the faux pas with a complete lack of filter attachment ability and the lens cap- power on/off.In the still mode (non-video) this camera will pretty much do whatever you ask of it, IF you've studied the manual and played with it.  I promise you that if you are putting it in \"AUTO\" and expecting it to figure everything out, you'll be disappointed.  Experiment, learn the camera.  It IS an amazing piece of technology.I was using a grade 6 SD card today.  That is the minimum Nikon recommends. It took approximately 13 seconds for the camera to process an HDR photo and a couple more seconds to write it to the card. Camera continues to show practically no lag time when taking standard shots.  Only panoramas and HDR slow things down, with HDR certainly taking the longest.  Nikon does have a progress bar that appears across the bottom so you don't think the camera is locked up.While using full (or near full) zoom and in Auto mode, the camera did a fair amount of searching to focus on an item while in MACRO.  Since my previous Lumix TZ5 was less than optimal in low light focusing, I am used to using either PROGRAM or Aperture priority on the Nikon to achieve focus on the intended target.In what i consider \"medium light\" the camera refused to allow an aperture setting to maintain an narrow field of focus.I'm certainly not down-grading my rating of the camera.  I like it very much.Just remember it is not a DSLR.  In comparison it has a tiny sensor.  There are always trade-offs.  I am more convinced that this camera will suit my intended uses very well. The VR at extreme zoom still impresses me, as does the low light sensitivity and noise.  Yes, there's noise, even at 560 ISO.  It's not distracting however.  Wait for the camera geeks to test and publish their data (i.e. dpreview.com) to get the hard statistics.  My over all impression still stands and I'm glad I took a gamble and pre-ordered this camera and was on the initial round of deliveries from Amazon.<ORIGINAL POST> I have had possession of my P500 for my second evening to this point.I've gotten to \"play\" a bit with it and here are my impressions.Is it \"the perfect camera for everyone?\"  No.I personally don't believe such an animal exists nor will likely ever. Important factors to one shooter may be a non-factor or possibly a negative to another.What is important is for each individual consumer (or gift giver)is consider the features that are most important to you.Quickly summarizing me and my trigger points:1)Travel friendly; great for nature shots, scenics, wildlife, architecture and has video capabilities. Do a reasonable job of photographing people when I must.Size wise, very similar form factor (though a bit smaller)than my previous coolpix 8700. (Though nearly 3 times as thick and heavier than it's immediate predecessor, Panasonic's Lumix TZ5)  Unless you have large cargo pockets, this is NOT a pocket-able camera. I have large hands and I find it comfortable to work with with controls placed logically and well. I passed the camera to a female co-worker with small hands and she also felt comfortable handling it, though she didn't take any shots with it.  Build quality seems very solid.  Some anticipated usage? Panoramas (this one does nice ones very cleanly and simply in both vertical and horizontal directions. It does horizontal in two flavors, 180 and 360 degrees PLEASE NOTE: you can only do the panorama in full wide angle and can not be in any zoom at all ) Catching wildlife in both stills from great distance and capture in slo-motion. Macro shots of flora and fauna. Along with \"conventional\" shots of points of interest.Under the USER function, you can set up frequently used settings rather than having to sift through menu options to change settings if you have certain effects you use regularly.Some (a very few)of my shots appear to be slightly over exposed. Adjusting down .3 to .6 seems to please my eye more. It isn't in all shots and all situations, so let your eye be the judge.The vibration reduction modes (there are two that minimize operator induced blur) seem to be very effective when taking still shots.  Think what you're asking this one pound of engineering to do when you're extended out to an effective 800+mm zoom.  Did every shot come out crystal clear? No. I had to cull out maybe every 5th or 6th photo.  This was free handing it, using the sharp and clear, tilting 3\" display and not the EVF, so it was away from my body and more prone to shake.I haven't run my camera with ISO's over 800 to this point.  I'll get out there and push it's limits more this weekend.  So far the noise generated by the camera have been well within acceptable limits for me. I wish the aperture was a touch bigger, but at this price point there is always trade-offs. The wide angle is wide, yet not exhibiting fish-eying.Color rendering seems to pretty good, though I have seen others photos where there were pretty obvious issues when compared to similar full size sensor DSLR photos.  I haven't experienced them and what I did see, can be easily corrected with some doctoring in a photo manipulation program.In the few videos I have shot, the camera's vibration reduction can't cancel all my shake at full or near full zoom. Again, this is all free hand, when I was more cautious or used the EVF, drawing the camera to my head and making for a more stable platform for shooting, things improved dramatically.There is no ability to attach a filter on the lens nor is there a hot shoe.  Regarding the filter, I wish I had the option to attach one if i wished, however it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I'm either shooting, or it's hanging down off my neck, on the ready or if I'm done shooting for a few, I snap the tethered lens cover on. Nikon is quiet clear that the cover must be removed before powering up the camera.  The camera is very fast in being ready for the first shot. I don't have a stop watch but it's well under 1/2 second from OFF to ready to focus and shoot. There is virtually no lag time between shots unless the camera is stitching together and processing a panorama shot or a few other situations that are clearly outlined by Nikon and I haven't experimented with as of yet. Nikon wants you to use class 6 SD cards or faster, to keep camera write times down and ability to shoot quick.My overall impression is very positive to this point.  I wasn't expecting DSLR results in regards to picture quality and flexibility in various shooting conditions.  This camera comes closer on both these aspects than I expected; and I'm carrying a LOT less gear and weight.Nikon really should provide an external battery charger with the kit. In camera charging takes the camera out of use during the process.  Otherwise the only other area I see they really missed the mark was by not adding threads to the lens barrel allowing filters/attachments.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for What it is", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "R3RNFGY68EXEB6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the Nikon p90 and p100, so I've got an idea of what these Nikon superzooms are like. I wasn't planning on buying a new superzoom, but the big jump in zoom to 810mm made me plonk down the money again. ( I think I need help, I'm becomeing a camera junkie). While wide angles aren't usually something I look for in most cameras, 22.5mm (35mm format) is really wide! The p500 is once again evolutionary, rather than revolutionary.The Good:- Light and easy to hold, which makes it a good travelling camera. Less than half the weight of my dslr with an 18-200mm lens attached.- Tilting 3 inch LCD screen.- Humungous zoom. I write before that the Fujifilm HS10 720mm zoom was huge. 810mm is even huger! (This is the zoom range it should have been in the p100 imho, but as they say, better late than never). You will truly see things you'd never thought you'd see when you zoom out to 810mm.- Easy to use...relatively.  Since I've already used several Nikons, I'm more used to it than you might be if you are new to the brand, so I didn't find it especially difficult to navigate. If you are a pure point and shoot person using little compact cameras, you might find the functions available a bit daunting and you'll need to look up both the manual, and a FAQ section of photography terms and functions to know how to alter things like shutter speed and aperture. I use shutter speed sometimes, but not aperture, since it's nothing to shout about. If I want thin sections of focus, I go to my dlsr and f1.4 prime lens :)- Photo quality is not bad for this type of camera. Definitely not dslr quality. But if you just want that photo (and you'll take heaps with 22.5-810mm on tap) then this will more than satisfy you.- Macros: macro photo quality have always been quite reasonable in the Nikon p90, p100, and this model too. In some ways, they give dslr's a run for their money because while not in the same league pixel peeping wise, you can get a heck of a lot closer with the p90, p100 and p500, so the colour and detail is quite decent imho. Colour is not as full and bright as some other brands, but is quite acceptable in good light. It's a bit faded indoors or in poor light.- Now comes is red, as well as black! Ok, this isn't really a big thing, but if you don't want common boring black, you now have a choice. Maybe it will appeal to others :)The Bad:- They STILL don't provide an external charger! As I wrote before in the p100 review- I'm lucky- I still have a spare from the Nikon s10. All you poor saps who don't will have to charge your camera battery using the USB cable and supplied AC charger. I don't know how much an external charger and spare battery are, but if you buy this camera, I'd suggest buying these too.- If you turn on the camera while the lens cap is on, the camera will freeze up and the motor makes this sad grinding/whining noise as it tries to pathetically push the lens out against the lens cap. This is crazy! It was like this in the p90, p100 and they still haven't fixed it!- Still has the same form factor as before. That's mostly good, but the small electronic viewfinder remains too. I don't find it easy to use.I haven't used the video, so can't comment.Overall, it's more of the same from Nikon, except the lens goes wider and further.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very well engineered camera", "Author": "Matthias M. Giwer", "ReviewID": "R27UWYFYKEABNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me. Photography was a serious hobby back in the film days. I had the usual SLRs plus one I had modified for close up work on large format film. I also have an interest in technical illustrations. With digital I went through three low end point and shoots holding off until there was a digital that could do more than I had done with film cameras. This is that camera -- and just as I got used to no viewfinder I have one again.I first tried to focus this review as between low and high end point and shoots. But low end does not mean fewer features as it did in the film days. Today's low end was yesterday's high end. I found a theme that I think works. This camera takes even old, expected features and expands their limits while perfecting them. At the same time it includes features which simplify doing what the experts do.That said, I am enthusiastic about this camera. The single disappointment is it does not stitch the interval photos into a time lapse movie clip. But I can do that with free software on my computer so it is not a serious disappointment.I have tried a little bit to keep my perverse sense of humor under control. I did not completely succeed.On with the review.===The price is not for one gimmick like the zoom range which is what gets your first attention. Every feature is state of the art. If you want to save $100 you will take a hit in several areas. Sure you really can survive with a lesser zoom range but that camera will have other lesser features such as 720p max instead of 1080p. This is a well-engineered camera. You don't take a hit on one feature to get another. It does not have one great feature on an otherwise mediocre camera. If you are considering buying you can stop trying to find the \"gotchas.\" There are none.Yes it does have a point and shoot size sensor. The size and cost of the lens is a function of the sensor size. The larger the sensor the more the camera will cost for the same lens features. The good news is the sensor is CMOS instead of CCD. This gives the same performance in lower light so the lower f-stop of the lens is less of a handicap. Related to this the low f-stop is related to the zoom range for the same price range.Guys! It comes in the same shade of red as that sports car you are going to buy some day. Don't dismiss it as girlie.In the auto mode it is an idiot proof point and shoot. You don't have to read the fine manual. Turn it on, pop up the flash and press the shutter button. Wife, son, daughter, relative or in-law can take a picture of you with no instructions whatsoever. No more family outings with dozens of pictures of everyone but you. You do not have to carry a simple point and shoot in addition to this camera.And by idiot proof I mean myself. When in doubt get at least one image in the auto mode before playing around. It is likely to be near the best shot you can get. Trust the camera. The software has all the technical knowledge as well photographic judgement included.Technical because snow scenes really are bluish as the snow reflects the blue sky so that it technically correct. Photographic judgement because our eyes adjust to snow when out in it and do not see the blue. But it shows up in prints where it shows the real scene not what we saw. So the snow mode takes out the blue. In fireworks we \"see\" lots of after images that really are not there so the camera makes exposure compensations to produce the image we saw not what was actually there at the time of the exposure. Trust the camera. It knows the tricks of the trade.Yes that 36x zoom got your attention. You might have missed the 1cm, 4/10\", close up macro while thinking about taking pictures of the moon. It means a close-up of a quarter won't fit on a monitor. So you get a low power microscope thrown into the deal. If you can get insects to hold still more power to you. Flowers can't fly away.Those pictures of a huge rising full moon are done by taking a picture of it at full zoom so it appears much larger compared to objects on the horizon. Do not try this with the sun unless you can comfortably look at it without sunglasses. It can destroy the sensor. You can also do these with interval timing to show the rise and set of the sun. When you can do what the pro's do you have bragging rights.The 22.5mm with no zoom is wide enough to take a group photo in a small room and gives a good chunk of the landscape without using the panorama mode. The zoom range allows you to take pictures at any distance with subject filling the frame. A zoom lens to do this with a DSLR will cost several times more than this camera if you can find one. Generally you will need several lenses and a 2nd mortgage to pay for them.Yes it is large and weighs a pound. Weight is good because there is less vibration. Size is good because five finger, two-handed grip means less vibration. Besides that the vibration reduction schemes work quite well. Nothing will substitute for a good tripod or for resting against something solid even your own chest with the extended LCD. Nothing will substitute for a steady mount in low light. This is state of the art engineering not magic.Putting stabilization and higher zoom levels together means you can get pictures of action without having to get close enough to disturb the action. The kids have discovered a new bug or something. You can get pictures of it without getting so close that you get \"Daddy, look what we found\" changing the scene you wanted.The other side of the coin is you can be part of the fun using the auto mode without having to think about the camera. Click the flower icon and get a picture of what the kids found so interesting -- maybe it isn't something dead. (And if it is dead you can hide the image from the review menu so mother doesn't see it.) No fumbling with settings and menus. No \"hold still while I get the camera ready\" or \"You're blocking the light.\" The camera will take care of you.Want to have a little fun? Put it in smart portrait mode and point it at a TV and watch it finding the faces. This also gives a feel for how it identifies faces so you can learn how focus will work when shooting people. BTW: This takes processing which means it is a battery drain. If other modes do similar amounts of processing this explains why the battery does not last as long as people seem to expect.Why care? The batteries are cheap enough. I got a charger and three spares for about $10. I have not made note of conditions such as flash/no flash but I haven't gotten less than 120 shots per charge and as high as 250. Outside the camera they take about a hour to recharge. I'm not complaining about battery life in the least. While your at it a spare SD card never hurts. An extra $25 in functional extras for a $400 camera is peanuts.An 8GB card is over a thousand images at the largest size and highest quality. Unless you want to carry around the family photo album that is big enough for most uses. 8GB is also around five fully charged batteries worth of pictures. If you are not going to carry the spare batteries there is no point to a larger card.If you do not want to read the manual just put it in auto and forget it. You can figure out what all the commonly used settings do just by pushing the buttons.The manual on disk is concise. It does cover every feature but you have to read carefully. Each subsection is telling you something. There is a high dynamic range (HDR) mode buried in the camera. One line will tell you the 1cm close up is only at the third step of the zoom. It is all there.Every feature is covered with a short explanation of what it does. It is enough to try it and see for yourself. Yes, each section could be longer but it is not an education in photography.If you want to learn digital photography there are books devoted to that. Here is a secret those publishers do not want you to know. 90% of what the books are telling you is the same for both film and digital. What you can find in a used book store is most of what you need and with luck for 10% of the price. If you don't mind doing your own research you can google up all you need to know for free.And if you have had digital cameras before everything you learned on the low end cameras translates to this camera. The basic buttons are even in the same place and do the same things. What more can you ask?===Yes, autofocus is slow in low lighting conditions. Autofocus works by maximizing contrast. In low light there is little contrast. The red LED is trying to brighten the image enough produce contrast. There are limits to what technology can do. That is why there is manual focus -- use it. Keep in mind if it were not for the capabilities of this camera you would likely not be trying some of these low light pictures. Something is better than nothing.Which leads to what this camera is beyond point and shoot. It lets you get beyond the point and shoot when the scene modes are not good enough or simply do not get what you want. Sure we can talk about being artistic but are we really artists? Will the next Ansel Adams please raise his hand? We are looking for the best picture or for something interesting that cannot be easily added by computer software such as Gimp dot org -- which google as it is free.Lets go back a few decades when automated exposure was the latest must have feature in cameras. Before that it was all manual. After the automatic exposure fad wore off the companies introduced aperture and shutter priority modes. Progress and then lets get back to the good old days. So this camera has the four modes one expects cameras to have as options in addition to the full auto, idiot proof mode. But even in these modes the camera tries to warn you if try to do something the software says should not work but it doesn't stop you from trying.So what has changed? Auto not only sets the proper exposure. It tries to pick the right scene mode. You can choose the scene mode manually or you can trust the camera. Most of the time it is going to work as well as you picking the scene. There are so many scene modes to choose from I doubt anyone can pretend to have tried them all. Here in Tampa, Florida snow scenes are out. For the scenes I have tried there is no quality difference between my choice and auto. They are different but best is a matter of taste.But you do want to try several options. A night portrait in muted incandescent porch light is different from a camp fire which is not a candle. Now think of a night portrait of a subject with a camp fire in the background. There is only so much the software can do. Better than adequate pictures are found in a batch of adequate pictures. Take LOTS of pictures. The camera has features like exposure bracketing to do this all at once instead of asking your subject to hold still for minutes at a time and changing the mood of a very enjoyable evening.When professional photographers say takes lots of pictures they are not just pushing the shutter a lot of times. They are changing things for each picture. One of the things they are doing is exposure bracketing. There is an automatic feature to do that. The camera has other multiple exposure features to do the other things the professionals try.I can't think of a reason for a five hour limitation for interval shooting, aka time lapse. That said, five hours will cover most events such as opening flowers. And there is no reason not put push the shutter again for another five hours worth of images. It is not a deal-breaker. It is an added feature. Unless I have missed a menu option some place this does not stitch them together into a video clip. You will need other software for that. There are image sizes compatible with video aspect ratios.True there is no way to attach filters to the lens. These days there isn't much use for them save to protect the lens as image processing software can do all the effects and dozens more. The only reason left is to protect the lens. This is a glass lens. It is not easy to scratch. I do not worry about it. I have used cameras regularly for over 40 years and have never scratched a lens. If I were to worry about something it would be dust in the zoom mechanism, flour in the kitchen being in the category of dust. That is just a guess. I have no idea if that would be a problem. Given this is from Nikon I doubt it.===Despite another review, the camera I have does in fact have zoom in one power steps. It isn't smooth but it isn't big jumps either. And yes it is a bit slow but if it were faster it would be harder to adjust. It takes a bit of practice to get fine control of the zoom. If it were faster fine adjustment would be harder. Until there is a multi-speed zoom, you can't have it both ways.A faster zoom would also be a noisier zoom and people love to zoom while making movies. They either do not like the noise of the zoom or complain the sound goes off while zooming. One wishes people would notice how rarely zoom is used by Hollywood. It is rarely used because it rarely works for a scene. Don't do it.Making movies is a different set of skills than stills. It is better to splice a long and a close shot than to zoom in. It has more dramatic effect. Zooms that do work are so fast they might as well be splices.Remember you are not making a movie. For movies you are supposed to splice scenes together, change their order, delete scenes. Unless you are doing post production editing you are not making a movie, you are recording an event, warts and all. The bride might want to have the entire ceremony start to finish to relive it at some indeterminate future date. No one else ever wants to see in its entirety not even, or perhaps especially not, the groom.Keep in mind this is a fancy still camera with movie capability included. If you want to make serious movies you need to get a video camera as much above a Flip\u00ae as this is above a simple point and shoot. Videos need much greater stabilization than stills. Tripods are a necessity. When the camera moves a steady cam mount is needed. Never compare your results with those of Hollywood.Be gentle with yourself.Your standard for comparison is your neighbor's videos not what you see on TV. Do not expect miracles from the audio. Cardioid mikes pointing forward do not fit in this form factor. Professionals do not have microphones on the cameras. That is for amateur movie makers working alone. The closest professional comparison is your local evening news with $6000 and up video cameras.Keep in mind it is an added feature just as many video cameras throw in taking stills as a feature. You would not buy a movie camera for its quality stills nor vice versa.All that said, the videos aren't half bad at all. 1080p, the best HDTV standard, is as good as you have to get and it gives you the smaller formats down to old style TV, 640x480. The file size/recording time specs suggest the finest recording level is about the quality that is used for movies on DVD. It is still going to be video quality not film converted to video. It is more than good enough for family events.If you grew up on and have bad memories of home movies in Super 8, this is a whole new world. If you don't want to lug around a video camera on the off chance of a couple minutes use this will work. If you go back to the good old days of DAT tape this is still a whole new world.Above all, do not forget you can take videos. Use it for any kind of action. You may trash it later but it might be pure gold. You never know what people are going to do when they are having fun. The button is placed conveniently where you don't have to think to start recording.I find it surprising that people will take dozens of pictures of their kids at action events like little league or soccer and not have one video clip. There is software that will let you pull stills out of a movie clip. Far from the best but more than good enough for the internet.A word of advice. Do not try video of action at extreme zoom. You can't follow the action like the highly paid professionals for major league games. They practice more hours every day than you spend at a game once a week. And the networks have more than one cameramen trying to get the same action. It is not uncommon for all three cameramen to fail to get a close up. If you succeed, congratulations. If you fail, don't kick yourself, practice -- a lot.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "M. Dobyns \"Rabid Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R39FAIJEPAZS5T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an advanced amateur photographer I was looking for a lightweight camera to take on vacations that not only took great pictures but had some advanced features not available on the typical point and shoot.  I also wanted a viewfinder for those shots in very bright sunlight where the LCD viewfinder washes out giving true meaning to the term \"point-and-shoot.\"I am a long time Nikon user and presently I have a D90 for serious photography.  The controls on the P500 are very similar to Nikon SLR's and so I was good to go right out of the box.  I do not recommend this camera for a novice, because it has many features you will not understand and will only confuse you.  Even so, if you just put it on automatic and forget about everything else the camera will do the work and you will take great pictures.  I do recommend that you get a fast SD card, at least a class 6, but a class 10 would be better.  A 16 gig card is perfect unless you plan on taking alot of video.What I like about this camera:X The pull out and tilt LCD lets you compose pictures at waist level.  No need to hold the camera at eye level for every shot.  This allows you to watch events with your eyes and not on a little LCD screen as you wait for the next good shot.  Over head shots at air shows are easy without tilting your head back.  Video can be taken with your arms at you side and bent at the elbow which provides for better stability and less fatigue on those long takes.X A viewfinder for those shots where the sun is behind you and the LCD washes out. (The P500 has 5 levels of screen brightness and I found that on level 5 the screen still displays a readily usable image even in the brightest light so I may never need the viewfinder after all.)X The camera is small and lightweight and takes excellent photos and videos in 1080p.  This makes it not only much easier to carry around than my D90, it is much lower in cost so if it gets stolen while on vacation I can get over it easier.X Controls and settings are typically Nikon and very user friendly.X A real-time histogram display can be added to the screen so you can see if the exposure is balanced before you take the picture so you don't have to take it twice.  Very cool and something my D90 can't do.X There is a manual exposure override button on the top of the camera at your finger tip so adding or subtracting exposure is quick and easy.X The lens cap has a slot molded into the side and comes with a cord so you can tether your lens cap to your camera strap.  A very nice idea.  No need for those adhesive backed lens cap holders that are ugly and always come off.What could be better on this camera:X The USB cable is not the standard mini plug that is very common and available at any large drugstore.  This is needed to connect the camera to the computer to download pictures (unless you have a SD card reader)and for charging the battery.  If you are away from home and you lose the cable you are out of luck.  What were they thinking?  Get an extra battery and the Nikon charger.X The camera has no hot shoe.  The pop-up flash does a good job at 12 feet or less, but it would be nice to be able to put my Nikon SB400 flash on it for a bit more oomph.  Not even a sync socket, so this limits your picture taking ability in very low light.X The lens will not come out with lens cap on but you get a warning sound and a message on the screen to tell you to take the cap off so I don't think this is an major issueX Last but not least:  No threads on the lens for mounting filters such as a skylight filter to protect the lens, or more importantly, a polarizing filter.  Again, what were they thinking?All things considered this camera is almost perfect.  If you are more than a novice photographer you will appreciate the many features and capabilities of this lightweight and compact little guy.  I for one am very satisfied with my purchase and can't wait to take it on vacation.BTW, the Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Camera Case (Black) ($15.00 on Amazon) is the perfect case for the CoolPix P500 or the CoolPix P100.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great still images, pathic video", "Author": "Jacquelyn Stewart", "ReviewID": "RFWKFGK21TFVM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are many reviews on the Internet and here that describe the still image performance of the P500, which is very good for a mega-zoom camera. I was really impressed by my first test images, but then I tried the hi-def video on my church choir. The worst part is during zooming: the camera makes no attempt to focus until the zooming is stopped (the manual says to avoid this by selecting the 1-time focus default where focus for the *entire* clip is set by the first frame). If you pan over to something at a different distance, the camera is locked into an out of focus setting--real nice! So, as you starting zooming the image goes out of focus, zooming stops, then the P500 takes 1-2 seconds searching for the focus. This is unacceptable, and to make it even worst, the sound dropped unequally left & right during the out of focus time. The end result of zooming is out of focus images and sound that suddenly increases up in volume and finally you have a decent picture & sound, until you decide to zoom again. Oh, and to make this even more wonderful, you can hear the zoom motor running & stopping in the sound track, even over a loud choir singing.

The wide angle works great, almost a panorama in itself.  Just 4 days ago couldn't resist getting a D5100 DSLR for Nikon, and my opinion still stands that's it's 90% of the picture quality at one third the price, even considering that an extra lens for the D5100 will get you nowhere near the zoom capabilities of the P500.Please remember this is the top end of point-and-shoot catagories, the camera is NOT a pocket, you need a small dslr case for it, but it's still lightweight enough that it won't be a nuisance to carry around. And, it has so many setting combinations that the more you experiment, the better your results will be.  The P500 has excellent out-of-camera pictures.  This has always been a complaint from me on point-and-shoots, that you almost always needed post-processing to get the exposure right. Here you do not.One final compliment: This would be the camera, if I could only take one, that I would take to a Yankees game. I would switch it to movie and take a film of a walk-off to put on YouTube!And finally, if you have a P-series Nikon like I do, it is a worthwhile upgrade.Best Nikon Point-and-shoot-If you have one and want to upgrade, this is it!  For three years I've had a Coolpix P80, and more than being impressed, almost overwhelmed with it, I'm always checking for the latest evolution, and the current straight-line P120 didn't make me want to make a jump.  Didn't know that a P500 even existed until I started browsing. To me the series \"L\" Nikons were the popular priced Nikon point-and-shoots (ala L22,etc and L110s)so this camera had the specs to make me interested and buy.Here';s what I love about it so far, and why I bought it: WIDE ANGLE 22.5! I like to do panaromic and outdoor scenes, and this is about the widest point and shoot with known good picture quality I can find.If you're going on a special vacation and don't want to take your DSLR and all it's lenses, this is the one camera to take.  It will do super-duper zoom but also give you free range for landscape shots.  A DSLR will give you marginally better depth-of-field if you want to carry an extra 7 pounds around with you.  If you want to fool with this, it will probably give you 90% of the DSLR characteristics, at much more cost and concern about your equipment.A word for amazon users: This was bought 3rd party and the delivery and service was great. Don't be afraid! They even included a cleaning kit and case for the lowest preice.One final tip for people not wanting to do a lot of post-processing- turn the exposure down 1/2 a step for better out-of-camera shots.  Haven't had a point-and-shoot yet that didn't turn out a little over-exposed dus to compensation for smaller sensor size in normal outdoor lighting.Edit 5/9/11- Note to those who don't like the charging through the camera set up- If you have an older P series Nikon, the P500 uses the same battery as a P80.  So I use my charger from that- it does the battery instead of plugging in the whole camera.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Totally love...", "Author": "Christina Myers", "ReviewID": "RUFP9ORSXOKNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a couple of weeks after it came out and so far I'm in love.

I love all of the Auto settings and the manual feature has been an eye opening experience to shoot with.  The video is very good quality and I'm impressed at sturdy it feels.  As I use it more, I'm sure I'll update this, but my initial impressions are A+!Update: After using this for a month, I have utilized more features and wanted to report.  The multi-shot feature was excellent when attending a MLB game.  We got some wonderful shots with the great zoom.

I am not even an amateur photographer. I just want really great family photos. Ones that I can crop and edit and still have a focused picture for my scrapbook when all is said and done. I think a DSLR is too much camera for me, but something that fits in my pocket isn't enough. What to do? Here's the chronological account of my hunt:1. Own Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3.  Love it because:  - It does a decent job at capturing the moment - especially in sports mode (more equiv. to burst than sports).  - Takes decent video, although if you capture a still-shot from the video it is a little grainy.  - Portability. It is great to have a decent (i.e. not smartphone) camera in your purse at all times.  Wish it could:  - Take even higher res photos (because I always thought higher megapixels = higher quality photo, which I now know to only be partly true.)  - Zoom farther so I don't have to crop as much2. Panasonic has manufacturer defect that created dark spots on my photos. They send me a new one. New one is great, but eventually has same problem, now out of warranty. Disenchanted with Panasonic quality, I decide to look at other options.3. I see a Nikon flyer and drool at the V1 & P500. Ashton Kutcher sucks me in, and I'm poised for a Nikon b/c it seems sexy and hip. (Score one for marketing, negative point for stupid girl sucked in by such things. I don't even like Ashton Kutcher, I just like the marketing. Isn't that so sad. But, I digress...) Check snapsort.com, read reviews, and visit local photo shop. V1 is out of my price range, and I am liking the specs on the P500 - check out that zoom! We compare to Canon T3 DSLR. I had trouble deciding between the super-zoom digicam and DSLR, but settle in the end on the P500. I walk out with the Nikon, a little uneasy about the choice, but excited that I have a Nikon, feeling all, \"I've got a cool camera!\" happy. I do not open it or play with it as I am under strict orders that it must wait until Christmas. And, I love my husband, so I wait. Man, I hope I made the right choice!4. It is now Christmas morning - the moment I've been waiting for! I unwrap the package and take out my new sexy, hip Nikon to begin taking shots of our family gathering and my especially adorable niece. Love her! Anyway, I snap away on the standard settings with no flash (I think one day I read a blog that said try without, and I liked it and stuck with it.) As I look at what I've shot so far, many are very blurry! I fiddle with the settings, ensure the image stabilization is on, etc. Yep. All is well, and this should be shooting decent photos. I decide to shoot a few with flash open. Well, there is marked improvement for sure, but it took forever to focus. All morning I'd fiddle and snap, fiddle and snap. And, the more I used it the more I didn't like it. My photos were blurry, but what was perfectly clear is that I was duped by marketing. I do NOT love this camera. It is not consistent in taking a good photo. Tear. I shoot the rest of the day in video mode, only to be further disappointed.5. I resolved to head back to the photo shop. I knew one of two things: there was something wrong with the camera or there was something wrong with me. Either way, I needed a solution. I expected to hear something like, \"You just don't know what you're doing...\" but I didn't. They were even able to reproduce the same effect in the store. I showed them my pictures, and they looked at the settings, unable to see why it was shooting that way. In the end, they just said they thought it was working an awful lot to make all the adjustments. I decided I wouldn't be happy with it and had better try something else. I assumed my only other choice was to upgrade and move into the DSLR, and so we started looking at the T3. I just didn't want to spend that much, that's all. I know, it has all these great things about it and it can grow with me, blah blah blah. But I do not want to be a photographer. I just want good family photos, and is it worth spending $650 (a package with two lenses) for some decent scrapbook photos? I'm thinking maybe we should just go back to the little Panasonic. It was a good little camera, after all. But, I figure I can anti up, so \"I'll take it.\" comes out of my mouth. As fate would have it, they were out of stock. So they order one and I prepare to leave.6. At home, I give it a last ditch effort. My husband asks, \"So, tell me again - what's the advantage of the DSLR??\" and I say, \"Well, we gan grow with it and get add'l lenses, etc. To which he replies, \"Are we going to get new lenses?\" And I realize: I don't want the DSLR. It's more camera than I need, but especially more camera than I want. I don't want a big bulky thing. I want big zoom in a little package. I go to Sam's Club for groceries, now completely unsure of myself in this camera escapade. I walk in a spy the Canon & Nikons on display right near the front. Nothing like salt on the wound! But, then I spot it: the Canon SX40 HS. Hey - that's just like the Nikon P500, but Canon. Why didn't they show me that at the photo shop? (Side note: I decided at this point that my suspicions were correct: my local shop offered me nothing more than I could get online. In fact, I got BETTER info online than in the store.) I called the shop from right there at Sam's. \"Oh, I didn't think of that!\" he says. (Seriously, I have a Nikon P500 I like the idea of, but it isn't performing, and you don't think to show me the Canon counterpart? What a joke.)7. Back to the photo store to check out the SX40. (B/c of the return policy I have to shop there. Otherwise, I wouldn't.) As I play with it, I feel the \"Canon-ness\" of it. You know. Canon just has a feel about it. It even sounds like a Canon. I think this may just be it. I decide I am not going to be an amateur photographer, I just want family photos, dang it! I am not going to buy a big DSLR, I am getting the SX 40. We make the Nikon-Canon swap and I head home with the Canon SX40 HS.8. I LOVE THE CANON SX 40 HS! The zoom is UNBELIEVABLE! The photos are crisp, and clear - no blur! The high-speed burst just spits 'em out! Hoorah! It just feels right! I took photos in low light last night, and in snow cover today. I just know that this will be a great camera for upgraded general-use. I don't care about the ISO limitation others complain about. I am not taking time lapse photos as night, and generally don't take photos at night, anyway. I don't care about \"full\" manual control b/c I don't know enough about ISO or shutter speed to change it, anyway. And, I don't have the time to learn right now. The built-in setting on this camera will be perfectly fine for what I want, and I am SO glad we chose this. It's hard not to feel like to you have an inferior product, since it isn't a DSLR, but this product is more than what we need. It is superior to average point & shoot. It is a SUPER zoom.So, if you are just looking for a really great camera, with good solid specs that will take good overall photos, then look no further - and don't visit your local photo shop. Just do your research online, read the reviews, use snapsort.com to review the specs. Ignore the Nikon P500 and go with the Canon SX 40 HS.

I like the size of the camera and how it feels in my hands. The autofocus is also good enough for the price. I really like the LCD function and \"swivel\"!However, it has obvious issues with the battery. It would unexpectedly not turn on even though I was sure the battery was not exhausted. After charging for several hours, it would turn on but then I would get a \"battery exhausted\" message almost immediately on the camera's LCD. Once I charged it and took 10 pictures and a 1-minute video over the course of one day and the battery was exhausted.

It's not normal for them to build and ship defective products. I wasn't able to get a feel for whether the problem was software, firmware or hardware related, nobody seems to know out across the internet either, and Nikon is still explaining it away as \"operator error.\" Well, as a technology professional, owner of digital cameras since the mid-90's, owner of several Nikon and Canon digital cameras, and current owner of a Nikon D90 (which I love!) and a Panasonic Lumix ZS-7 (which I don't love but tolerate), I'm not amused when a camera manufacturer wants to call it my fault.

And this camera video functionality will beat almost any consumer video camera under $800.00 on the market. So you get the best of both worlds.All of the DLSR reviewer need to realize that this isn't a DSLR, and considering only the Body of a DSLR cost 2-3 time more then this camera they are not even in the same league Like comparing a Chevrolet Malibu to BMW. DSLR are for professionals \"or those who want to pretend they are\", while this camera is for the common man/women who wants great pictures and video to be viewed on a normal computer screen.Great Feautres:ZOOM is crazy. I call it Stalker zoom.  If you can see if with you naked eye, you can view it as if you where 2 feet away from it with the zoom.  I was even able to zoom to the surface of the Moon!!!FAST, the camera doesn't boot, it just start with almost no delay, and you can take pictures as fast as you can click the shoot button. If you use the continuous shooting mode (L) you can hold the shoot button and take 5-10 pictures in less then 1 second.The Program modes rocks, Night shoots, Face Priority, Dusk/Dawn etc.The LCD screen is clear, but the view find is even better.  Taking picture with the view finder maks taking pictures so must easier.the snap back zoom is a life saver, you can zoom all the way back \"to get a over view\" then zoom all the way back to where you were at with one click.HD is insane, super clear video for a cheap under $400 camera.  Video suck with you try to zoom all the way out, but come on, your zooming at 36X with shaky hands. I purchased a cheap Tripod from radio shack for $9.99 and my videos look profession quality.You can shoot pictures at night in the dark with no flash and they look like you took them in the day time \"beside some black/white dot speckled through out\"Things that suck:Batteries suck big time, having a second battery isn't an option it's a must. Under normal use the battery should last about 200 picture and about 1 hour of video. But if your the type that love to keep it on, and keep the LCD screen on that batteries will go fast. I notices that if i only use the LCD view finder batteries last a whole lot longer, but i purchased 2 extra batteries just in case. Today I used it for about 3 hour \"LCD only\" and took a bout 1 hundred shot and it still lasted, but if i would have kept the LCD on it def would have died.Auto focus is slow in low light when you are zooming.  Sometimes i just turn on manual focus and focus it my self.Auto focus in full zoom is so slow it will sometimes cause you to miss a shot If you planning on shooting fast moving object do yourself a favor \"set the side control to manual focus, increase shutter speed and use continuous shooting <-- i save this under \"User Setting\" this way you never have to wait till the camera finishes focusing to snap a shot.  But don't get it confused, no point and shoot camera on the market is better \"i tried them all\", fast moving action with quick focus is a $1,000 DSLR class feature.  <-- this doesn't apply under normal focus below 10X, auto focus is almost instant.No external Charger: brought my own for $9.99, but it should have def come with it in the box. matter of fact 2 batteries and external charger should have been standard, but you can get 2 battery and charger for an extra $25.00.Useless button that could have been better used else where.  The continuous shooting mode didn't need it's on button, nor those the exposure, or disp option require separate buttons.  Those 3 button would have been better served by other more important features \"ISO, 1 button press for manual vs auto focus, etc\"But all in all, for the common user this is by far the best camera deal in years!!!

You'll need a tripod for a decent shot.2.  I needed to be able to stand behind a crowd of parents taking pictures, raise my hands and still see what I am taking a shot of thanks to the P500's tilting LCD.3.  P300, S95 and LX5 are all probably better for low light (wider aperture), but with a steady hand, a tripod, a chair, ISO 400-3200, really - I can still take the same shot with the P500.  I have gotten very good results in low light. The exposure bracketing is also a great feature.4.  I wanted the P500's 1080p30fps video with stereo sound and 30 minute limit per video clip.  I needed to capture video without having to buy a separate camcorder.  FYI at 720p it uses 1.2MB per sec and at 1080p it uses 1.6MB per second of SD card space.  Use a high speed SD card (I use class 10) by the way.  So a minimum 8GB card should be sufficient for 1 hour footage plus photos.5.  I needed something portable.  Yes, the P300, S95, LX5 can fit in any pocket, but the P500 isn't heavy or bulky compared to a DSLR.6.  I would have liked to get the D3100 to replace my 10 year old Nikon F100 film SLR and use its lenses only for $120 more, but carrying a large camera and lenses will be too tiring.  Also the D3100 is limited to 10 minutes per video clip plus the \"zoom\" is dependent on the bulky lens attached.  I guess I will have to continue to wait for the D700 to drop in price.7.  Yes P500 can't do RAW, but so what? I don't want to tinker with every photo in Photoshop.  Imagine processing 600 photos taken during a 4 week vacation.8.  Yes P500 doesn't produce the best photos, you would want film or DSLR for that, but I needed portability more.  Besides, the P500 came out with decent photos, and acceptable noise at the higher ISO (400+).9.  I don't need a flash hot shoe, again, for portability I don't want carrying an external flash.  The pop-up flash is sufficient.  Besides, I avoid flash photography.10.  Finally, I have experienced 3 canon cameras needing major repair, 10 sony products needing major repair, and an olympus water proof camera failing to deliver sharp images and failing to keep the water out, so I am trying Nikon for the second time.

But only utilizing 90% of zoom handheld still gives you tremendous range with the ability to go further with tripod and digital zoom, a plus in my eyes.Focus can be touchy at times but I've found that for whatever reason just a simple tap of the zoom in either direction quickly brings subject into focus. Also, there is plenty of megapixles to zoom and crop post exposure (in-camera) while maintaining clarity. This technique has gotten me around being without a tripod/monopod many times over.

The camera was only 5 days old!  To me if something this small is not correct, I didn't want to keep the camera. I was hoping to just exchange it for another, but since Costco was out I could not. I'm trying to decide if I should spend $20 in gas to go to another Costco that has these in-stock...buy from here...or just go to Best Buy.  Or do I get a Canon like my MIL (not sure I can believe I am actually saying that)?  I want my camera!  I did enjoy using it while it lasted.6-9-11:After playing with my MIL Canon XS30IS today, I decided the Nikon takes better pictures and zooms better.  Colors are more vibrant as well. I don't like the Canon screen flipping out to the side, it's also heavier and the size difference is enough that I felt like the Canon was almost too small for my hands. Tonight I found another Costco with the Nikon P500 instock, so I bought it to try out again.  I'll update once it's charged and ready to go!  If this one doesn't work right either, I'll contemplate a third time or just settling for the Canon.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "mgauss \"mgauss\"", "ReviewID": "R1BV9FEDAZTQP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finally a long zoom with a high res LCD.

We had very high hopes but it just didn't work. I would say that 50% of the photos were blurry and that was not due to user error. The camera would get stuck in focus land where it just could not focus. We thought it was us until we set up our daughters doll across the living room (20x13) to be photographed. Needless to say it was our best attempt at being fair to the camera since the doll was not going to move around like the kids do and we did stand still and take the shot because even though we could have used a tripod lets face it... how often would we use one to take photos of our kids... we wanted to be fair to real life yet give the camera alittle edge with a still object to capture. We took the shot with flash on, then flash off, in auto, in portrait, and in our manual mode. We took several photos in each of the above settings and at least one out of each set was blurry. This was giving the camera an advantage and it still failed! So we are sending it back. Here is a breakdown of the good and bad.The Good:1. It zooms in and out while recording a video. Our 1 year old Panasonic did not and we hated that.2. The red color is beautiful... my favorite color on the camera by far.3. The size is just right - not too small but not overbearing to put in my purse or wear with the included carry straps.4. It is very light compared to how sturdy if feels. I held it up for long periods of time learning to use it and never felt my arms tire or lag from the weight.5. This camera feels very sturdy. I never dropped it or anything but it feels like it could take a drop and keep on shooting.6. The finger/hand grips are perfect and leave your hand feeling natural while holding it and getting the perfect shot.7. The flash it really really good. I shot many photos of different object in my bedroom by only the light from the TV and NO flash and every object came out in the photo. I also took photos of the kids and such in dark rooms and they came out clearly.. although I did not try it at a far distance. I think they were always within 10 feet of the camera when I took the photo.8. The zoom is incredible. I zoomed almost feet to a screw in the wall and it came out clearly and the details were not blurred. It is harder to hold steady zooming that far, but a steady hand and added patience and you will not be disappointed.9. All the buttons are perfectly placed and easy to navigate quickly when needing to get a shot/video10. The videos are great clarity and the sound is great. I love that the speaker is in front of the camera unlike our Panasonic that had it near the back and anytime we spoke it would end up like we were screaming since the sound on the tv had to be turned way up to hear the kids talking.11. Love the one touch button to record videos.The Bad:1. On average with shooting our three kids (that move about while we try to get the shot) we had to delete about 40% of the photos due to blurry shots no matter the mode, no matter the flash, no matter the settings.2. The auto portrait option was horrible...it took forever to get the shot and never had one that came out clear. I mean forever to get it too!3. There were times we would try to get a photo and the camera would just try and try to focus and just wouldn't. We would have to turn if off and then back on. Don't know what that was about... this occurred only twice when we turned on the camera not during taking shots.4. Why only 12.1 mp?5. No external battery charger. This is a huge oversight on Nikon's part in my opinion. I have never had a camera that didn't offer this. You can buy one here on Amazon for under 10.00 which I did but really... no sense as to why Nikon didn't just include it.6. If you try turn the camera on and the lens is in place it it will after about 10 seconds flash a notice on the LCD to \"please remove cover and then restart camera.\" Mine camera does not make all kinds of loud or grinding sounds like others have said but why not just say... remove lens cover, why do we have to turn camera off and then on again.7. One of my BIG complains is that you cannot review your photos without taking the lens over off and turing on the camera. Why can't you just leave the cover on and push another button to just view your photos or show your photos. It is also annoying to do this because if you or whomever is looking at your photos hits the pan/shoot button by accident it automatically goes into camera mode. ANNOYING!8. Auto mode was just not right for us. Over half of our photos came out blurry in auto mode, we eventually just made our own auto mode in manual and it was way more successful in getting some clear shots.Well I hope I helped someone. I hope if you get this camera it is great for you... I really wish it could have been for us.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "An impressive zoom and a nice camera", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R15F3DYJRM54MX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up the week it arrived at the store and was impressed. I wanted to get an all-purpose camera that I could use to shoot video as well as take great pictures. I have always loved a long zoom and this camera would replace an Olympus SP-565 which had a 26mm-520mm (20x) zoom. This Nikon has an even more impressive 22.5mm-810mm (36x) zoom so I was anxious to see how well it would perform. It would be a companion to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS1 which is much smaller. I use the Panasonic when I need to pocket the camera conveniently and the new Nikon when I want to have more power in the camera.I was not disappointed at all with the image quality nor the ability to shoot pictures at either end of the telephoto range. I have seen several bad reviews given on image quality of long zoom cameras and I wonder if it is the photographer and not the camera. I never use the \"Auto\" mode and typically use the \"P\" mode and set the camera up so I can put the subject in the brackets at the center, press the button halfway to focus, frame the image, and then take the picture. In decent light, I can take perfect pictures at full telephoto. Of course, in poor lighting or with fast moving subjects, it may be harder to get perfect pictures at full zoom, but that is to be expected with any camera with a long zoom. As to the full-wide angle, it is awesome - you can fit a lot in and I have not had problems due to wide-angle distortion. You will be amazed to take one picture at full wide and another at full telephoto. The zoom range is so vast that you will be hard pressed to be able to see the item in the full wide picture. Sure, you can probably take a better picture with an SLR, but you would be spending a lot more money and have to lug around a larger camera. Also, the resolution at 12mp is great. You can crop away a lot of picture and still be left with something that can be printed and still look good.I also wanted to be able to shoot video and liked the idea of being able to shoot it at 1080p. I am not as serious about video but wanted to be able to shoot a good quality video now and again and the video does look good. I also used the software to extract a frame of the video into a still image, which is useful for a moving subject that you can't seem to be able to capture in the perfect pose. While the video frame is obviously not up to the same resolution as a still image, if you can't get the image otherwise, it is better than nothing and can certainly be printed in small size.A couple issues that I did not like but were minor:- The battery must be charged by leaving it in the camera and connecting a cable.  This is rather stupid, but the problem was solved by purchasing a battery and charger.  I was able to get two batteries and a charger for under $10, not Nikon name brand battery, but it is the same type of battery and it worked fine.- You have to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on, otherwise, the lens tries to extend and the cap blocks it.  This seems to be a common issue I have seen in other brands as well.- (ADDED POINT) There are folks complaining about the short battery life, and while this is true, a firmware update will correct the problem.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Coolpix P500 Rocks", "Author": "G.

The printing on the camera is very cheap looking but will probably hold up (and not rub off) over the long haul.  Battery life seems good.I found that the Nikon P500 was not a user friendly camera.  I had the following problems.(1) focusing - what the hell?!  Inconsistent and unpredictable focusingI focused on my hummingbird feeder approximately 40 times without making any camera adjustments in between shots.  About 5 times, the focus was sharp and the other times  the focus was off by a mile.(2) Focusing - what the hell?! Part IISame thing in the field.  I zoomed all the way out and focused on a butterfly and got a sharp picture.  Without making adjustments, I then tried to focus on a butterfly that was further away, but this time the image in the viewfinder was blurry and I got the blinking light telling me that I was too close!(3) Fuzzy ViewfinderEven after adjusting the diopter, it was hard to distinguish subjects in the viewfinder.  The viewfinder itself is small.(4) Multiple images - needlessly confusingThe multiple image button is oddly placed on top of the camera so you have to take your off the subject and  tilt the camera down to look for it.  When you press the button, too many options pop up.  This menu for taking multiple images is foolishly confusing.  At one point, I took multiple shots and didn't even realize it until after I looked at the photos on the computer.(5) Terrible viewing optionsIf you choose to look through the viewfinder, instead of the LCD screen, then when you go to Playback, the played back images only appear on the tiny viewfinder.  On my Canon SX10, the images are played back on both the viewfinder and the LCD screen, where it is easier to see them.Did anyone at Nikon ever try this camera out?(6)  Light exposure compensation.A turn wheel can be used to make choices throughout the camera menu system.  Except for light EV compensation  Here, you have to switch over to the cursor arrows.  If you try to use the wheel, it screws up the exposure.  Why the change in method? Again, did anyone at Nikon ever try this camera out?(7) Freeze up -If you go a few moments without taking a photo, the camera freezes up.  Sometimes you have try the zoom in/out lever several times or tap on the shutter button several times to get control back.  By this time, the subject has flown away!(8) Comparison I did a side-by-side comparison where I photographed the same 17 subjects with both the Nikon Coolpix P500 and the older Canon SX10.  Wow.  The Nikon images are larger (36X optical zoom vs Canon's 20X optical zoom), but otherwise the it's like day and night.  Canon's images are always sharper.  Sometimes, even though I thought that the image in Nikon's  viewfinder was sharp and the camera gave me the \"go ahead\" to shoot (no blinking light), the images turned out totally useless - blurry beyond usability. Only one photo shot on the Nikon is worth keeping.**************************Someone else wondered how this camera got a 4-star rating I have to echo his sentiment.  If you take general photos, such as landscapes and children and aren't too picky about quality, then it's an OK camera.  But if you want sharp photos of detailed subjects, such as close insects and far-away birds, this is not a good choice.  The older Canon SX10 out-performs the Nikon in ease of use and image quality.Someone had a good idea by  suggesting that you take a memory card to the store so you can try the camera and BUT  look at the images, at home, on your computer.

Have been very pleased.  It takes FANTASTIC pictures.  The zoom and image stabilization work wonderfully.  I promise you'll be taking pictures and video you like you've never taken before.I've owned many compact digital cameras over the years.  Seems like none of them last more than a few years before they quit working for various reasons.  I guess electronics are just disposable these days.  Hope this Nikon lasts for a while, though.  Seems like a really nice camera.One thing Nikon could have done to make this a 5 star camera is to design it such that it accepts AA batteries.  I could not find replacement batteries for it at the local stores.  The EN EL-5 lithium battery that came with the camera must be charged inside the camera.  It's probably good for a few hundred shots, but the more you use the flash and the zoom the fewer shots you'll get.  I'd strongly recommend purchasing a few extra batteries and an external charger (where you don't have to charge the battery inside the camera).  I found several very economical extra battery & charger combinations here on Amazon, like Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Nikon EN-EL5, Coolpix 3700, 4200, 5200, 5900, 7900, P3, P4, P80, P90, P100, P500, P5000, P5100, P6000, S10.One more thing.

The wife, the kids, the cat, non will pose for this camera twice.  It's like hitting the subjects in the eye with a red laser.  Mine came with the newer 1.1 firmware that doesn't seem to have any of the battery or SD card issues.  Good for me, as I was prepared to flash the firmware.  I shot over 200 pictures, mostly outdoor, maybe 10 or 20 flashes, and some HD video today, and the battery still shows full.  I enabled digital zoom in the menus, but I can't figure out how to actually use the digital zoom, something about twisting the control?  It's probably better that I can't digital zoom, 36x is good enough.  It's difficult to tell when you are not in wide angle and want that first 1x normal shot.  I thought I saw a little triangle once below the zoom bar to tell you it's normal, but the little triangle went away.  Focus is slow.  Pictures look great when viewed full screen on the computer, but only fair when zoomed to 100%.  No RAW, not that I ever shoot much RAW, but it would have been nice to see without compression artifact.  Although the 3 inch screen tilting looks great, the eye piece view finder resolution is not optical, poor electronic cam corder, and it looks like you're looking at a window screen.  When using the menu, it still sends the menu to the eye piece rather than the screen (or I wish it did both).  My AUTO pictures are fair or blurry, but switching into some manual overrides for shutter speed are pretty easy and improves quality.  Even with it's sensor VR on, blurry probably has to do with the absence of a lens stabilizer.  But it really ought to work in Auto well, but unfortunately the P500 falls short.  Manual focus is better than most compacts, I was able to use the left side zoom buttons, but it still feels wrong without a ring, like \"drive by wire\" the manual focus has no subtle feel.  The continuous shooting works pretty well, quick enough on \"low\" with good enough quality, but what is up with playing them back?  The Nikon treats the still JPG series like a video on playback, so doesn't tell you how many individual pics there are in the series until you click on \"okay\" to drill into the shots.  Outdoor shots are great, colors look fine, but I didn't but this camera just for outdoors.  This camera is supposed to do HDR, but HDR is not in the user manual's index or any menu I came across.  Not as obvious as, forgive me, the iPhone 4.  Maybe HDR is coupled with \"a scene\" or something ridiculous, who knows, I can't find it in the non-paper manual's index.

I just enjoy taking photos. I still use film camera, which I had long preferred and had used regularly until now.

I was thinking about getting a DSLR, but didn't want to spend so much money. I've been reading reviews about this line of cameras. Nikon Coolpix 500 received a number of positive reviews with a reasonable price. After considerable research, I decided on this camera and I must say that I am pleased with the purchase.It is easy to operate, almost idiot friendly, in fact, and has many options like smart portrait, night landscape, and manual. I love the telephoto lens that allows me to get close up shots of birds at my feeders or in the trees.  The camera makes great use of ambient light, which look even better when I use the flash. Sunset photos with telephoto, flash and night landscape are vibrant.I like the fact that when you forget to take off the camera cap, the camera reminds you to shut if off and remove the cap. Also, the cap can't be put back on into place unless the camera is off. I'm still getting used to and finding my way around the camera, but all in all, I'm quite happy with it.In the box with it comes a hard copy of the Quick Start Guide, which is all you really need, two CD's that contain a User's Guide, editing and photo software, cord for use as USB cord or with the AC plug. It also comes with a battery, strap and camera cap. It is energy savings and shuts off after a few minutes of non-use.It is better than a basic point and shoot, but not a DSLR.

Outdoor photos comes in nice, but seems a bit dull or dark overall, but still very nice & sharp. I use AUTO mode for now and I have been and still am experimenting with various other settings with minor improvements in outdoor photo quality. Of course, this is not a DSLR camera and don't expect DSLR photo quality here. I can adjust photos I take here with computer software as I edit the photos taken with this camera. Photos using quite a bit of zoom has been somewhat \"washed out\" in appearance and I don't get that with other cameras too much except for this one and another Fuji zoom camera I had before. Now the 36X Optical zoom is quite good....just 1X more than my Canon. But my Canon does take a better picture overall than this Nikon camera, including with the zoom used, but still nice photos with the Nikon also, as long as you don't use too much zoom.I use class 8 or class 10 SD cards with this camera. I did use a class 4 SD card once and it seemed to work just fine also.Videos can be better, but overall, I guess it's fine. I do not attend to use the video feature on this camera much and never do with the super-zoom digital cameras as I have a compact camcorder for that job.Menu system on this camera is very well-organized and easy to navigate.....a nice plus for the camera.It does come with a Nikon rechargable battery....but NO external charger. I bought one external charger and 4 additional batteries for this camera. You can charge the battery inside the camera with the supplied connections to charge it up if you don't want to buy an external battery charger. Also, I have noticed it takes close to 6 hours to charge a battery up with this camera...using an external battery charger. So, I may buy another external battery charger for this camera. It only took maybe 3 hours to fully charge the battery on the Canon camera with their supplied charger.The camera is not too heavy, feels good to handle and has rubber handle grip and a rubber pad on the camera backside also, a nice feature. Easy to use camera for sure.So, to sum up what I think of this camera in a nutshell.....it's a decent easy to use camera, with a great optical zoom, takes good indoor and outdoor photos....as long as you don't use too much zoom and easy to handle.I would have given it more than a 3-star rating, but the zoomed photos being washed out, minor video issue, long battery recharge times, no external battery charger supplied with the camera....I will just give it a 3-star rating.If you want a good \"super-zoom\" all-in-one digital camera, this one is not too bad overall. You get good photos and a camera with lots of features on it for a decent price.I will probably update my review after I do more experimenting with manual settings. I hope this review helps some out there about this camera.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blurry Pictures", "Author": "RSETTIN \"rsettin\"", "ReviewID": "R1N1JNL8KXOI7O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a semi-pro photographer.

I wanted a new camera that can zoom in close to take pics of our kids soccer and music events. I was happy with the camera overall. It does zoom in quite close but when you are at max zoom in, the pic is jittery and hard to take. Same with video at max zoom. So I usually back out some before I take the photo and that works pretty good. I like the sport event setting that takes up to 5 pics in a row which is very handy. The camera is easy to use which is good since I'm not high tech at all.So here's the downside. About 3 weeks before the 1 yr warranty is up. I noticed there were some vertical black lines on the right side of the LCD screen. I didn't think much about it; chalking it up to dirt on lens. So 2 wks later I decided to clean the lens. Well the lines were still there after so I showed it to my husband. You can guess what he said. He told me there's something wrong w/ the camera and we need to send it in for repair cause the lines will get worse and eventually the whole screen may go bad. Silly me huh? I told you I'm not techy at all. I realized then that we may have missed our window for warranty repair. And yes we did if we go by purchase date by a few days. Since I didn't get the camera until May 20, I hoped that Nikon would cut me some slack if I contacted them immediately. I did that and got an incident # so there's a record. I packed up the camera and shipped it off for repair.Long story short. Nikon said my camera has a cracked LCD screen and I have to pay $100 to get it fixed. This is because I missed the warranty date by couple wks. It doesn't matter that the problem first showed up during warranty and I would be within warranty period if they go by camera ship receiving date! I called Nikon service & support to get more explanation on how the LCD would get damaged since I kept it in a padded camera case. I didn't drop it or hit it against anything & the camera was less than a yr old to have a major component failure. The svc person was nice, promised to request a repair estimate review, etc. And I should get an email about the review request and hear from Nikon soon. I also asked for someone in repair to call me so I can understand better what happened to my LCD screen if the estimate is not going to be adjusted or waived. I gave her my cell phone #. No one called or emailed me. I called again yesterday, 6/5 and was told by a different person there was no record of my 5/29 call or estimate review request. I was also told that the LCD screen is very sensitive (whatever that means) and is not covered under warranty. I explained that I had the camera in a special camera case unless I'm taking photos. I was careful with it so I don't understand how it can be cracked. Anyway, she said she will request a repair review. She did but all it said was I called for a repair status which is NOT the whole story. I have no idea what will happen to the camera. I expect to pay to get it repaired. What gripes me is I expect better quality and service from Nikon.If the LCD screen is so sensitive then Nikon should warn buyers. Better yet Nikon should design it so it wouldn't be so sensitive or at least provide a hard protector lid/cap for it.In my opinion, if you have $400 to spend on a camera and you don't expect it to last more than 1 yr, then buy Nikon Coolpix P500. Otherwise buy something else that lasts longer and has better customer service support! I won't buy another Nikon camera. This is our second and we had problem with both!

We decided to send the camera back to Nikon.  I was presented with $105 repair estimate for a bad USB port.  Did I mention that the camera was less than 3 months old.  When I called customer service, I was told that I was given the estimate because I did not include the proof of purchase and that it should be covered. I downloaded the POP and was told that the supervisor was reviewing the estimate and I would hear in 1-2 business days.  2-1/2 weeks later and 4 contact attempts resulted in hearing that the USB port was damaged and I would have to pay the $105 repair.  2-1/2 weeks and I had to call.  Nice news - talk about being between a rock and a hard spot.  Can I prove the USB port is damaged - No. So what good is the warranty?

It has a 36X zoom lens that starts at 22mm which is the main reason I bought it.  It's reasonably compact and except for a few major items is a good full featured camera.Here are my quibbles:I bought a 32GB PQI memory card and found it was incompatible with the camera.  Apparently, Nikon is not concerned about compatibility as they only support a handful of cards and won't update thye firmware to make it compatible with other cards.  I never had compatibility problems before and this card works perfectly with 3 Canon cameras I own and tried it on.I'm used to Canon and Casio cameras and this is my first Nikon.  I was surprised to find that the camera does not detect rotation and properly handle vertical pictures.  You have to correct the problem in your editing program by manually rotating the effected pictures.The LCD does not swivel completely (it's hinged and only swivels vertically) and is only useful for vertical pictures when using the hinge.  Also, it does not swivel 180 degrees like the similar Canon.There are some annoying software bugs that require you to reset the camera while shooting.  The Nikon web site says one was fixed in firmware 1.1 and my camera came with that firmware but I encounter the problem regularly.  After taking only a few pictures, the camera reports the battery is dead but when you charge it, it takes only 15 minutes or so to be charged indicating that it really was not dead.  I've lost several priceless photo opportunities.  Also, sometimes it starts up in the wrong mode and rotating the mode dial results in bizarre choices.  You have to remove the battery and restart a couple of times to get it back on track.The charger does not charge the battery while out of the camera.  I always carry a spare battery and would like to be able to charge the battery while continuing to shoot.All in all, I wish I had waited for the Canon SX40.

Dealing with chronic pain pretty much curtails my activities, and lugging equipment is out of the question.  This camera serves me well.The boot up time really is swift.

The main reason I was interested in the camera because of the amazing zoom range.  After trying to use this \"amazing\" zoom, I soon learned that is was IMPOSSIBLE to use the highest ranges of the zoom without a tripod or a completely still solid surface to rest the camera on.  I've also used my cousin's FZ-40, and one of the features that the FZ40 has that the p500 does not is that the FZ40 tells you what zoom you are at [i.e 2x, 10x, etc] while you have to guess with the p500.I was also a little disappointed in the image quality -- being that this is a Nikon, I expected top-notch images, but that's not always the case.  Indoor images often have odd colors, from my experience.  And it is not easy to quickly adjust the colors -- you have to go through the menu and put some work into searching for the setting you are looking for.  Then, when you are confused and wish you had a manual to quickly reference to help you find what you are looking for, you realize that the manual is on a CD -- so if you are not near a computer, you can't use it.The battery life is nowhere near that of my cousin's FZ40, and the fact that you have to charge the battery in the camera made me quickly purchase an aftermarket charge kit with batteries.  I got 2 batteries, the wall charger, and a car charger plug all for under $10 here on Amazon.  That kit is a lifesaver and I think I would be returning the camera were it not for this kit. I really don't use the video feature, so I can't comment on it.

I had owned the Sony DSC-H2 for years until it finally quit focusing and it was time for a new one. I spent months researching and tried & returned 2 other cameras before finding this gem of a camera. First off, I'm not a \"pro\" photographer. I'm an architect and I use photography a lot as a tool so I know a bit but by no means am I a \"pro\".I originally gave Fujifilm's HS-20 a try. The camera had great picture quality and the easy panorama was terrific. However, the auto-focus was just awful. It was so bad that when I went back through picture I had taken during a family party I had to throw away almost half of the pictures because the came out blurry. It also weighed a ton. Noticeably more weight than my previous Sony DSC-H2 which is no pocket size camera either. The manual zoom barrel was good because popping in and out of a scene was very quick but making fine adjustments is really tough and its terrible for video mode. It has a manual focus ring but I found that to be junk. I won't even begin to bore you with how bad the video quality was.I returned the HS-20 and tried out a much cheaper model the Nikon s9100. That camera had a lot going for it, pocket sized, really outstanding user interface, and good pic quality, but I found the range of options was just too slim. Its obviously a camera better suited to more casual photographers that just want a good travel camera. If that is what you're looking for than I would recommend the s9100. Having just tried out the HS-20 though, I felt the sting of the downgrade way too much. So, again, I returned that camera and finally came upon the p500.I felt like Goldilocks in the 3 bears house!! The Nikon P500 was just right for me. The ultra zoom is really awesome, the 35x optical really gives you the freedom to get the pictures you want. The ultra-wide angle on the other side of the lens is also great. A lot of times I just don't have enough room to back out and frame the entire picture I want so having a very wide angle helps out tremendously. Picture quality is very solid. I think fuji's HS-20 may be better but only slightly. My brother has a VERY expensive dSLR Nikon camera (model??) which I compared pictures with and you really need a magnifying lens to tell them apart. Obviously the dSLR pics are better but at a huge difference in price and weight. Whenever he wants to use it he's got lug around this enormous piece of luggage that weight a ton. For the kind of \"every day\" picture taking I do its not worth it. The Nikon P500 is lightweight (relatively) and very versatile. It has enough user control that allows me to play around with the little I know about photography while not being overwhelming or over simplistic. Video/Audio quality is good, not out-of-sight but definitely passable.Only a few things left me wanting in this camera and that is: 1- The easy panorama mode is not quite as complete as fujifilm's hs-20. You have to be very delicate with it or it won't come out right. It works but it takes some practice in order to get it right. With the HS-20 I could just swing that sucker around and out popped a beautiful panorama, Nikon's is a bit more touchy. 2- I really wish they had integrated the circular control dial like the s9100's. It seems like such a little thing, a rotating control dial on the same menu button. And yet it was probably the most notable feature on the s9100. These aren't big gripes, more like wishlist type stuff.I've had the P500 now for over a month and I'm extremely happy with it. I just wish I had found it sooner!!", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "pictures come out too blurry and distorted", "Author": "S54B32", "ReviewID": "R2MHDUYEX8KCZS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for over six months now, and have taken at least a thousand photos, several HD videos and slow motion videos. The camera is user friendly with its menus, buttons and controls. I use a 32GB memory card with this camera so it does support it. The battery charger failed one week after I received the camera *thumbs down*... I just use my cell phone charger and computer USB ports to charge the camera when I need to. The charger is simply a USB wall adapter with detachable USB cable.Two things that I don't like (a) the wide zoom angle distorts and blurs the picture around the edges, and (b) the camera can't focus well in low light. Sometimes the camera/lens will keep focusing and never be able to pick up the correct focus setting, even with indoor daytime lighting. Other than that, all other pictures came out great. If you've ever used an SLR class of cameras, don't expect this camera's focus time to impress you; it just takes too long in my opinion (sometimes over 3 seconds).If you're used to shooting simple videos with your cell phone, the HD video with this camera will stun you with clarity (it did to me anyway). I never had anything that could shoot slow motion video so this camera did a great job for my first time. The video is smaller resolution in slow motion, but you could still see amazing detail.Other than the cheaply made charger, I like the camera.

If you know what time lapse video or timed interval shooting mode is used for, then you know that 5 hours is a very short amount of time.  In fact, other cameras have no time limit at all and that's how it should be.  The only limit should be storage card space and battery.-No dedicated battery charger, the battery must be charged in camera via \"USB\".  Or, you have to buy an extra charger on Ebay.-Cannot power the camera via \"USB,\" very strange that the \"USB\" port only allows you to charge the camera but not power it, say for extended shooting periods, like time-lapse photography...makes NO SENSE AT ALL!-Non standard USB port.  Come on Nikon, if you're gonna make us charge thru the USB port, then at least use a standard mini or micro USB port!  Instead, it's some weird USB port that I've never seen before.-Nikon's sensor IS (image stabilization) system is far inferior to Canon's optical lens IS system.-When recording video, Nikon's IS system doesn't even turn on.  Or else, it's so bad that you can't even tell that it's on.-If you just want to turn on the camera to view images, the camera will require you to remove the lens cap, even if you don't want to take any pictures.  The lens always protrudes out into a \"ready\" position when the camera is on, even if all you plan to do is view images on it.-Focusing is slower than Canon's USM focus system, which is on the Canon SX30 IS (this model's competitor)-Nikon's flip out LCD system is probably the WORST mechanism I've seen on any camera.  Why couldn't they just use a standard flip out LCD like everyone else?-No continuous zoom.  The lens will zoom up to 36x but the zoom range is not continuous.  In other words, it won't let you go from 1x to 2x, 3, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 9x, 10x, 11x, 12x, 13x...etc up to 36x in \"continuous\" 1x increments.  Instead, when you press the zoom in button, it's like it skips to 6x, then 12x, then 18x, then 24x, etc up to 36x.  It's definitely not a continuous zoom range.  Quite a failure not being able to be able to use the awesome range of this zoom at a more fine range of zoom steps.-When recording video, it doesn't allow you to record at the widest length of the lens (ie, 22.5mm).  Instead, when you start recording video, the lens zooms in to about 30-35mm and won't let you zoom out.  You can test this by putting the camera on a tripod and then take a picture at the widest lens length.  Then, without touching the zoom buttons, start recording a video.  Then compare the zoome range between both samples.  The video always zooms in and doesn't allow you to do wide angle video recording at the len's widest range.-When changing the aperture, the aperture indicator flickers.  Not sure if this is just a defect with my unit, but it's annoying.-Please make the UI as easy as Canon.  I've used Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and Canon.  Canon, by far, has the easiest to use interface.Everything else about this camera is great and performs as well as lots of review websites have described.  But, don't let that fool you into thinking this is some \"dream\" camera, because it's not.  In fact, it's pretty far from it.  I really hope Nikon reads these reviews and fixes these MAJOR flaws.  I wanted to keep this camera but with so many flaws, I can't justify keeping it, especially at this price.  I plan to wait until Nikon or Canon makes something w/o so many bad design and functional flaws.  They will come around someday and the less we buy, the faster they'll come around.UPDATE:I just discovered that the time lapse feature on this camera is severely limited to time lapse sessions of 5 hours maximum.  I found a video on Youtube showing this limitation:www D O T youtube D O T com / watch?v=wP0ydmQMLNgIt essentially means that if you take a time lapse with 10min intervals, the camera will only capture 30 images, which is only enough frames for 1 second of video at 30 fps.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as good as it should be", "Author": "Mr. Joseph Berlinger", "ReviewID": "R1FQFXLKVL53OF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a Nikon Coolpix P90 which I liked but I though, hey a 36x (810mm) was great for Nature phography.

The large focal length range of the zoom in such a compact body is an invaluable feature.  I use it extensively shooting wildlife, to be unobtrusive, and to accurately frame photos the way I want them.  A major deficiency for me is lack of a hotshoe to enable use of alternate flashes and the ability to use a sync cord for off camera flash use.  I don't like being limited to small pop-up flash, which severely curtails effective flash photography.  Because LCD screens can be difficult to use in sunlight, Nikon has provided the ability to switch to viewfinder use, which is a great feature I haven't seen on other non-SLR digital cameras.  I am however a little disappointed in the image quality through the viewfinder.  Surprising for Nikon.

I've used it at full-out zoom to photograph wildlife and at its widest angle for landscapes, and taken many photos under less than ideal lighting conditions. For what it is, it's been a champ. By that I mean, that it's not a DSLR, and if like me you also own a DSLR, you can't expect all the features and super quality images that a DSLR gives you.On the other hand, at this time I can't afford a super-zoom lens for my DSLR with the range of the zoom on this P500, and even if I could, the whole apparatus would be heavy and awkward to carry around.The photos I've gotten from this super-zoom point and shoot have not been disappointing. I haven't even worked much with the scene modes and other creative controls, because the auto settings have produced good results for me. It's light and not too bulky to carry around.The lens cap tends to fall off easily, and to avoid lens damage and accidental activation, I use a neoprene wrap to cover and protect the camera when it's not in use: Fotodiox Neoprene Zoom Camera Cover Sleeve (Travel Case) which fits the P500 nice and snug. I almost always carry this camera inside a large purse, tote bag, or backpack, so I don't need a dedicated camera bag for it. I also use a hand strap with it: OP/TECH USA 1801021 Cam Strap QD, instead of the strap supplied by Nikon.

After using it for a few months, I have moved on to a DSLR Canon 50D which gives me the results I am looking for. This camera offers a lot of good features but it doesn't perform more than average at any of them. There are no real strengths except in macro which it does moderately well. I do still appreciate it because I learned a lot from all the features it has and how they work but honestly if you want a long term purchase, get a real DSLR or another bridge camera. The best thing I can think about this camera is the ease of use and the screen display; the display is gorgeous and its actually a bit deceiving.The zoom abilities are impressive but again the image quality really is substandard when fully zoomed, even on a tripod. The video is also substandard as well, my Iphone4 gives me better quality and smoothness. 1080p lags and 720p does too from time to time; I originally thought it was just the memory card and upgraded it to a San Disk Extreme 32MBs and still saw no improvement.High Shutter Speeds and Burst Modes: Camera offers them but still are not impressive by any means. Get a DSLR if you want to truly catch moving subjects.Low light performance is poor but this isn't a DSLR either, I do wish the shutter wasn't limited be open for only 8 seconds. 30seconds would be a much more reasonable limit for night shots and a \"bulb\" setting would be preferred. Again this camera offers a lot of features but they were all done halfway, each of them fall short.I wanted this camera to be good, its a nice looking and fun to use but it does not offer the quality that it should. That is why I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who is on the fence between point-and-shoot and a full DSLR. I would just save for a good DSLR or at the very minimum pick a different camera in this price range. If Nikon actually would have offered less features and focused on the more important things like the image quality and video I believe this would have been a much better camera.

I found this to be somewhat annoying on more than a few occasions.  It was also a little hard getting use to the zoom operation being only available with the push of a button, one way or the other.  Even though the zoom is electronic, it is still easier to turn the zoom lens on my Canon by hand, which allows me to frame my picture exactly like I want it.

This review is simply from a laymans view.I am an amature photographer, and had (and still have) a NIKON N70 (35 MM format.)  When camera's went digital, I waited many years for the prices to come down.  Last year in February, I had purchased the D3100, for which hubby and I were to share! (Who was I kidding)  One of the reasons why I had chosen to get the NIKON D3100 was because of the extra lenses from the N70.  Within 2 months, I was faced with a decision to by a seperate camera for myself.One of the facts that I was faced with is that I enjoyed the D3100, but I didn't want to be bothered with carrying all the extra lenses, having to change them, etc.  I know I would loose intrest in my shot by the time I set up. (Hubby has more patients.)  I wanted a camera that I could treat like a point and shoot, but have the zoom capibility of a DSLR.  I went to local Photography store and to make a long story short, I ended up with the RED P500.I really have no regrets.  Some Cons are:  Battery life.  Our D3100 Battery hubby can take on average between 600 - 800, if not more, on one battery charge. P500 takes between 250 - 300 pictures on average per charge. (Colder weather it's less pics.) The charging time also takes a while.  Can take up to 4 - 8 hours to charge 1 battery.  I have not tried the video, so I can't comment.  Some Pros are the ZOOM.  I can get a lot Closer than some of the lenses my husband has.  By the time he switches lenses and focuses, I have already taken the shot, so portability is great. Focusing can be an issue the further out you go, but with a Tripod or a Monopod, they help.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best!", "Author": "california", "ReviewID": "RELDGQCYW4EU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is my baby.

Shots of the moon are clear enough to show the craters clearly and a long exposure of Jupiter showed the four Galilean moons, although with some streaking.Chromatic aberation is apparent at the long zoom settings, as is expected in a camera like this one. Image quality, especially with full digital zoom, is definitely a compromise.The HDR mode in backlighting is useful, but inconsistent. Fine details can be lost, even on a tripod.With such a long telephoto, any movement during exposure will cause smearing of the image. Without a remote release option, this means using the timer to do the release for maximum clarity.Shooting with maximum resolution and fine detail means large file sizes, so a fast SD card is a must with this camera. The minimum speed is Class 6, but I'd recommend Class 10 since the cost difference is minimal.Macro mode is useable, but not as good as some other compact cameras that I have. Of course, being able to get a clean shot of a humming bird at 15' is a real plus!While birding, carrying 15 lbs of camera gear can be quite exhausting. Having a small, light weight, versatile camera at hand can make the difference between capturing an image or wishing you had brought your camera with you.Will this replace a DSLR? Yes, if you don't mind losing some image quality for convenience. At the longest zoom settings, you probably won't be printing the images in large sizes to display on your wall, but you may end up with some prized images that you wouldn't have gotten any other way.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera !!", "Author": "B.

Obviously, a small tripod added to the stability for those high end zooms -- both flex and metal types were used.

Through this review I will have links to my sample videos on You tube. To get the videos to work, simply remove the spaces - sorry, the URL has to be mangled or else Amazon will zap it.**I had been awaiting the Nikon P500 for a while now, hoping it would be a worthy successor to my beloved Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7, which was my previous point-and-shoot. For stills I generally use my Canon EOS Rebel T2i DSLR, but when you're watching a concert sometimes all you want to do is point and click a single button. The Lumix ZS7 was great for this (see my other uploaded You tube videos), but it had some drawbacks - most noteably the limited 12x zoom and handicapped low-light performance. Note: I purchased the red version but the reviews don't seem to carry over.Auto-focus with video==============================Video: Sarah McLachlan singing \"Awakenings\" at the Chicago Theateryou tube . com / watch?v=YQ5PUe_amtMThe P500 had some nifty little tricks up its sleeve which made it sound ideal for concert-type photography. Unfortunately what's keeping it from being an awesome video camera is its incredibly slow auto-focus. At various points in my linked video, I move my focus from Sarah McLachlan to the various members in the band. At 1:50 I focus on Luke Doucet (the guitarist); he does not come completely into focus until 1:55. The slow auto-focus is really noticeable when changing zoom ratios. If you're at a static zoom and just panning the camera the auto-focus takes around ~1 second. If you zoom in or out, the focus takes an average of 3-to-4 seconds (2-4 in bright light).Compare the video from my original link to this one taken with the Panasonic Lumix ZS7:you tube . com / watch?v=2tHM392Ozyc (Sarah McLachlan singing \"Awakenings\" at the Austin City Music Hall)At around 1:04 in the ZS7 video I move from a non-zoom to a close up of Sarah McLachlan. Through the zoom process, the camera stays mostly in sharp focus unlike what you see with the P500.Now it should be noted that distance obviously comes into play here. With my ZS7 I was in the third row - less than fifteen feet from the stage and less than twenty feet away from Sarah. With my P500 in Chicago, I was on the front row of the second floor (Loge) which put me about forty-to-fifty feet away at an three-quarters angle to the stage. However the pre-focus light on my ZS7 was turned off (that giant red light), but turned on with the P500.  In other words, these were not identical situations by any means.Vibration Reduction with video==============================Video: Sarah McLachlan singing \"Building a Mystery\" at the Chicago Theateryou tube . com / watch?v=UcsttYmp_jEAnother thing you may have noticed is that the vibration reduction while handheld isn't that spectacular. If you fast-forward in the above video, from 2:30 onward all video is being taken with the use of a monopod. It's only with the addition of the monopod that the video becomes \"stable\".Spot Metering (Contrast in low light)==============================Now, where the P500 shined was its handing of spot metering. Through much of the concert footage with my Lumix ZS7, the bright spotlight caused the highlights to just become washed out. The P500 with its CMOS sensor did a much better job handling the contrast and keeping the detail without allowing the lows and highs to become blown out. I added a shot in the customer gallery of a sample still I took with the P500 by the light of a single tea light so you can see the P500's stellar performance in low light.Sound==============================The P500 comes with two insert microphones above the flash (in order to record in stereo). When you're working with video in a quiet environment the zoom lens does create an audible \"vrrrrrr *chuck!*\" sound when in use - and it will make its way onto the audio track of your video. This may be annoying to the concert goer if the performer is singing a quiet or acoustic set with no amplifier. However if you're at a fully amped concert it's probably loud enough that you won't hear the internal mechanics of the camera in the audio. The sound quality sits firmly in the \"ok\" realm of fidelity. When I got home and listened to the audio from my concert I wasn't overly impressed as I thought it sounded rather hollow. Then again, you can't really expect to get studio quality sound from these types of built in microphones (no built-in camera mic has impressed me yet).Portability (Hideability?)==============================Make no mistake, the P500 is freaking huge. I've added a few shots of the camera in the customer photos gallery - I have the P500 sitting next to my ZS7 and my T2i (sorry for the quality of that shot, I ran out of things to take pictures with and had to make due with my camera phone) with the lens fully extended and without. If I do not attach a lens to my T2i, the P500 is actually larger than my DSLR. One of the things I didn't like about my Lumix ZS7 was that I thought it was too big to be a throw-in-your-pocket camera. Well, the P500 makes my ZS7 look freaking tiny.That being said, if you're planning on sneaking in a camera to a concert, this one'll be very hard to conceal - and when that lens is fully extended it's like holding up a giant neon sign that screams, \"I HAVE A CAMERA!\"Conclusion==============================My purpose in purchasing the P500 was to have a good concert buddy. The max zoom of 810mm was just insane and it let me hope that I could grab a good, tight shot of the performer even from the nosebleed section. Unfortunately the performance of the auto-focus in video mode makes me rethink even keeping this camera around. The 36x zoom is freaking awesome and the small things like the 240 frames per second slow-mo movie modes make it a very neat (expensive) toy. If you're planning on using this camera purely to take stills, it's a pretty good point-and-shoot. The image quality suffers even in that capacity though - as quite a few online reviews/blogs will attest too. If your hope was to have a good all around stills-and-video superzoom, the P500 isn't quite there yet. If Nikon can somehow fix the slow auto-focus by way of a firmware update and clean up the noise at the high-end of its zoom with stills, then this camera would be spectacular.And just to be clear, I am not advocating filming concerts when the artists forbid it.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "NO MACRO CAPABILITY", "Author": "Danyo", "ReviewID": "R3KJKR6OLOR8H4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Nikon P500 does not live up to it's specs & users manual.

It took great indoor shots and I did not see these issues at lesser zoom, but why do you buy an ultra-zoom camera?  Right now my impression is this is a great camera if you are going to the Grand Canyon with a tripod, but if you think you are going to hold the camera in your hands and catch anything moving (kids, animals) at maximum zoom, or get pictures of your kid's school play, you will be disappointed. Also, after taking about 100 pictures and maybe 30 seconds of video, the fully-charged battery was down by about 3/4 as best I could tell from the indicator.

More importantly, the Canon is MUCH faster --- especially as it has a Digic 5 processor (the vaunted G12 still has a Digic 4).  It also seems to have a somewhat easier time focusing when you're really out there with the lens.  The battery is bigger, too.  Build quality --- a bit better on this Canon (seems otherwise at first but a plastic piece on the Nikon has a loose glue hold).  The Canon starts at a surprisingly good f/2.7, too.

Cone la P500 he logrado fotos de personas que con la Panasonic ni hubiera so\u00f1ado, muy bien por ah\u00ed.Lo malo viene con las fotos m\u00e1s complejas. Soy aficionado a la fotpgraf\u00eda de fauna, principalmente aves, y he tenido problemas serios con el enfoque. En situaciones de poca luz a veces la c\u00e1mara tarda 4-5 segundos en enfocar, y cuando lo hace generalmente no enfoca lo que quiero. Obviamente en esos 4-5 segundos el p\u00e1jaro ya se fue lo cual me frustra bastante...Incluso en situaciones de buena luz, suele tener problemas al enfocar. Lo hace r\u00e1pido y me parece que est\u00e1 justo en el blanco, pero al revisar la foto en grande resulta que est\u00e1 levemente borroso, lo cual es muy molesto pues cre\u00eda que hab\u00eda tomado la foto perfecta. Tomen en cuenta que generalmente para fotografiar un ave hay que hacerlo entre \u00e1rboles y ramas atravesadas, o bien con un fondo dif\u00edcil. Pero a\u00fan as\u00ed, esperaba un mejor rendimiento con el enfoque.El zoom es efectivo y muy bueno, solo que hay que tener buena luz, una velocidad de obturador de al menos 1/200 dir\u00eda yo con 36x zoom porque naturalmente la imagen se mueve bastante a menos que se tenga un tr\u00edpode.Muy buena para im\u00e1genes r\u00e1pidas en r\u00e1faga. Tiene varias opciones, a que m\u00e1s me gusta es la de r\u00e1faga r\u00e1pida, que toma unas 5 fotos en menos de un segundo. Al menos una no sale movida y eso me basta para efectos de las fotos de aves. Luego de la r\u00e1faga tarda unos 3-4 segundos en guardar los datos (tengo SD calidad 10), lo cual me parece bastante aceptable.En t\u00e9rminos generales, es excelente para fotografiar personas, incre\u00edble claridad, buen enfoque, buen zoom. Para fotos m\u00e1s complejas y en movimiento como con aves, el enfoque es deficiente.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as expected", "Author": "valves", "ReviewID": "R38NKJSWMENAIE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The instruction book says there is \"Manual Focus\" capability, but the camera doesn't have it!

I am an amature photographer with 25 years expierence with Nikon SLR camears and have never gotten such sad reuslts from any thing Nikon. The camera does not focus or do proper exposures when zoomed out and can not focus while panning moving items like pets or moving cars. Any redution in light below bright daylight exagerates these problems. What is most frustrating is trying to deal with Nikon Support. You must fill out a form on line and then \"submit\" it - 9 of my last 10 tries did not send comments/questions or the pictures showing my problems. I called and was given an Email address  which kicked back as well stating it did not receiveing inbound Email.  I have now been told to send the camera in for a check out and repair - except I need to pay for repacking (they do not want me to use the box in came in ??)and shipping. This camnera may have been defective out of the box but the attitude of the tech support people is nothing less than condescending (and yes they are not in the US) (I have blown enough time trying to work with Nikon that I am now beyond my reatailers return period !!  I think the term is  \"Screwed\". It is an attractive camera whith great features and is fairly easy to use - but DAH! - just does not take decent pictures. If you want to go ahead with this camera Please go to any local dealer and test it before you buy it on line or anywhere. Just watch the focus on the LCD as  you zoom or pan.If they let you take your SD card and try some pictures while Zoomed or panning and under low light conditions. Also -note that the LCD is always exposed - asking for damage......  at $400 this should be a much better piece of kit - it is no way a point & shoot if that is what you are looking for..

Ordered the P500 2 days ago and it arrived right on time.  Charged the battery, inserted it, and turned on the camera.  It created this grinding sound similar to what I've read happens when the lens cap is left on (the cap was NOT on this camera).  Eventually the display said to turn off the camera, remove the lens cap, and then turn the camera back on.  Tried this several time with the same result each time.  So, back it goes to Amazon.  VERY disappointing since I ordered this to arrive in time to take it on a cruise.  Sure would be nice to have a help line one could call when this sort of thing happens so that a new camera could be shipped overnight.This one will be shipped back tomorrow and I've ordered another.

At 500-meters, I still haven't found a compact zoom lens camera that beats the IQ of the Canon SX10IS mounted with a TCON-17 teleconversion lens and I've tried all of the super zooms to date -- all of them -- including the $7,000 Carl Zeiss PhotoScope. I'm now excited about the new Sony Cybershot DSC-HX100V digital camera coming out on May 1, 2011. The Sony HX100 has 16MP, a 30x optical zoom lens with 7x digital zoom. Hopefully, the enormous 16MP will not affect IQ and the camera will accept the TCON-17 teleconversion lens. Although I'm excited about the new Sony, I've learned not to get too excited -- I've been disappointed more than once with these zoom lens cameras.Mike", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "36x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom-NIKKOR ED Glass Lens.\n12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor for high-speed operation and exceptional low-light performance.\nCapture 5 shots in one second at full resolution\nFull HD (1080p) Movie with Stereo sound and HDMI Output\n5-way VR Image Stabilization System", "Name": "Nikon COOLPIX P500 12.1 CMOS Digital Camera with 36x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ShPUuu27L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004M8SVHU"}}
