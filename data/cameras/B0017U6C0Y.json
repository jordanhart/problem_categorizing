I was able to adjust the brightness and contrast under the camera set up options in the command center to get a good night picture on a dimly lit city block. With the adjustments, the picture was good enough at night to see who was passing by, and it even captured opossums at night. There was a lot more activity on my street than I was aware of.  I was able to set the camera recording area and sensitivity to not pick up movement across the street, just on my side of the street.  And I caught the culprit...After figuring out who the inconsiderate neighbor was, I moved the camera next to my raised pond in my backyard, where my turtle (Stephen Colbertle the Turtle) lives. I've wanted a turtle cam since building the pond! Stephen is a red eared slider, so I hardly ever get glimpses of him out of the water.  Now, I can see him up close and personal whenever he gets out to bask in the sun.  I've adjusted the camera sensitivity so it doesn't record (video on my computer) when the wind blows the pond plants a little, and I've set the brightness and contrast to auto-adjust (which works with the sunlight changes thoughout in the day).  I've set up a free account on the wilife website so I can even log in and check on my turtle when I'm at work.  It doesn't make for super exciting viewing but its pretty cool (okay, has been called geeky).When the camera was in my front yard, it was close to my computer inside the house (just one wall between camera and computer). Now that it is in the backyard, there are three rooms between where the computer and camera are, and some yard space, and there are no problems with the picture.I haven't had any problems with the camera, and I think the software program with command center is very easy to use and intuitive. If my camera dies, I will buy another one (if out of warrantee), and I am considering buying some additional ones to add to my system (watching for price drops).One thing I would recommend to anyone purchasing, rather than using the CD that comes with the camera to load the software, go to the wilife website and download the most up to date software for the system.I didn't expect the camera to work as well as it has (but I was tired of the dog poop on the sidewalk, and stopping that was enough motivation to give the camera a try).  So far, it has worked great for me and I am very pleased with this product.EDIT 12/1/11: I bought a second outdoor add-on camera in Dec. 2009, and both of my cameras are still working two years later.", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Didn't stand the test of time", "Author": "Michael Hershberger", "ReviewID": "R3JD84NZU2L4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I first got the system and installed it, I was excited.

Provencher \"ppro\"", "ReviewID": "R2CXL88GR50DEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a few neighborhood events and some teenage pranks on our home, I decided I wanted something to give me a view to what goes on outside my house.I found the system to be very easy to install.  The cameras may be placed anywhere there is a solid surface to mount them, and a way to run power to them.  The power line supplies the video feed so there is nothing else to wire.  I put three cameras in by simply affixing them to my house and running the power to a convenient outlet out of reach of outsiders.The receiving end of the video is a box that plugs into the regular power outlet in the wall, and the USB plug on the back of a computer.  The software installs very easily.In my case, the cameras came online immediately and the video image is reasonably good quality.I did run into one problem that I have not been able to solve.  And Logitech Customer service has been totally unresponsive to my submitted problem reports:  I cannot access the cameras from the free web site they provide for this purpose.  I believe the problem is related to my internet service provider configuration, my wireless router, firewall and IP addresses.  I suspect a session with customer service would get me through this, but no such luck yet.Notwithstanding my inability to get customer service and remote viewing, the system works great and records any movement detected to my hard drive for live or later viewing.  I can see the comings and goings, and also what's going on at night.  One caution - the cameras do not work in darkness without some sort of light source.  In my case, I have motion activated spots that are pointed at the same areas as the cameras so I get good images of any motion at night.  My friend who bought this system but does not have outdoor lighting, does not get any images at night, even though the cameras will detect motion and come on.  So purchase some motion-activated spotlights or another system.  Also, the infrared lighting that Logitech sells is not for the outdoor cameras so keep that in mind.Overall, I think this solution does a decent job of adding to my security profile.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good idea, Great possibilities, Satisfied with product", "Author": "Pinney", "ReviewID": "R1VNH2INJ586LL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had a Logitech WiLife Security system for over two years and there is a lot that I am satisfied with.  It was easy to install, the motion detection that can be activated by each individual camera is great and saves having a constant recording, connecting to my computer by house wiring is a great idea and one of the best features that I like about this system.  I am operating two cameras.  One of the went bad after an year and Logitech replaced it promptly.  I can keep at least four months of motion detection videos from two cameras on my computer and use less than 20 gig's.  With cats and other animals around, there are a lot of video recording.  To be able to attach this to my computer is another great feature of this product.  I have two desk top computers and I leave them on 24 hours a day 365 days a year.  I have done this for at least 7 years ahd have never had a hard drive go bad.  This is mainly due to very good battery backups.  Since I was already keeping my computers on, the Logitech system adapted well to my setup.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the cameras could produce clearer pictures.  I cannot read the letters and numbers on vehicle license plates that come down my driveway.  When compared to other security systems that a home owner can buy, these cameras are just as good or better.  I firmly believe Logitech has a great product and I wish they could improve the cameras.

S.", "ReviewID": "RRQU8EE97HC8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this outdoor camera after considering virtually every other option out there, including various IP cameras.  My intention was to use it to show my driveway, as stuff has been stolen out of my vehicles over the past few months while they were right in my driveway.  I had a couple of concerns about this product, primarily the 15 fps frame rate (which was half of other cams), the rated temperature it could withstand (I live in the northeast), and the low-light capabilities.I ended up purchasing it after seeing the high cost of various outdoor IP cams, and the fact that they were more involved to install.  I'm tech savvy, but not interested in doing wiring.  Turns out this cam solved all of my concerns.First, the outdoor cam is extremely easy to install.  Up and running just as advertised, although I will have to drill a big hole behind the cam to run the power cord through.  Be advised that it is permanently affixed to the cam, meaning that you will have to drill a big enough hole through wherever it's mounted to fit the plug end of the cord.  Drilling that hole is really the biggest issue with this camera.  If you don't have to do that, you're golden.With regard to the 15 fps, during the daytime it's no issue at all.  Very smooth and clear.  At night however, I've found 15 fps isn't quite enough to get perfectly smooth video.  It's a bit jerky, but not overly so.  For my purposes, it works.  You wouldn't want to use it at night professionally though, I dont think.  With regard to its low light capability, I was pleasantly surprised.  I live in a suburb of NYC, so we have street lights and neighbors close by, so there's always quite a bit of ambient light about.  Therefore, even before my motion-activated lights turn on and brighten my driveway, it gives a pretty good picture.  If you are out in the middle of nowhere where there isnt a lot of ambient light, your results may differ, but it should be fine anywhere you have any additional lights about.Finally, I was concerned about the durability of the cam itself.  I believe it says it's temperature rated down to about freezing, which concerned me, but I just used it during a blizzard and sub-freezing temps and there were no issues.  Not sure how that affects product life, but time will tell.Viewing the cam online is a snap, and provides various good alert functions to send the alerts to either an email address or a cell phone.  You can limit the sensitivity of the camera itself so it doesnt record every time car headlights reflect off you windows, and limit the area in which the camera will attempt to detect motion.  Very helpful.  You can only view a live feed online, not the recorded video, unless you purchase a platinum package from Logitech, currently valued at about $80 for the year.  I just recevied a $20 off email though, so I am considering it.  It provides additional features other than uploading your video to their server for viewing and storing (for the safety conscious), and also includes the ability to pan, tilt and zoom their indoor cams.The only real drawbacks are the lack of audio (not needed for my purposes), and the 15 fps at night.  Otherwise, this is a great cam, which can be added seamlessly to their other indoor cams.  It is cheaper than other good outdoor wireless IP cams, requires no wiring and does the job as advertised for residential purposes.  Not sure about using it commercially, as I have no need for that.

This is also from personal experience in this product..The cameras keep going offline and the connection is always bad; why I do not know since my house has all new wiring..The screen titles have disappeared for each of the cameras in the command center and redoing them doesn't bring them back.I checked disable the \"blinking LED\" on the cameras so anyone there wouldn't see them in the dark when they are tripped and give the cameras location away.. YET THEY CONTINUE TO BLINK WHEN MOTION IS DETECTED...I have them about six feet off the ground on the wall; I figure by the time they see or find the camera I have their picture; cameras are cheaper than the item they are watching..Another is the REQUIREMENT that you have to use windows media player to view video remotely meaning no \"droid\" phone can be used; ONLY A WINDOWS PHONE CAN BE USED.... Also unless you pay extra for this \"Platinum\" service you can't stream continuously; you only get about three minutes connection and then you have to reconnect for another three minutes to view..Windows 7 it can be run on; BU remember NOT to have your font set to larger than normal - you will get the screen resolution error and software install will abort..Also Windows 8 forget it it won't run on it...The cameras also get hot and that is from inside; not from the sun being on them.Another poster pointed out the caps in them fail due to the cheap design and build by Logitech...It appears they may run fine using one maybe two cameras; but using six unreliable for me..As for the six camera limit; why? I don't know why Logitech set this limit..Yes you can run more than six; but that will take another separate computer or maybe running multiple command centers in Virtual machines on one system; but I am not going to spend the money to try that.I will be replacing the caps as one poster showed how and selling off these pieces of \"fine technology\" since I bought six \"master\" kits.

Silverlight WILL NOT WORK ON A DROID PHONE. A person WAS working on porting it over to work on \"droid\" yet they had the cr*p sued out of them by you know who.....As I and many other have mentioned these Cameras are no longer supported by Logitech and you would most likely be wasting your money buying them.

In older houses or older wiring use only one camera per breaker circuit. Seem to work fine that way without any issues.

I was looking for an easy to setup system that didn't require running cable(s) all over the place to monitor my property and to prove to the city that the kid next door and his friends were vandalizing my property and creating disturbances. I liked the idea of running the video signal through the house wiring. I have one camera installed on the front of my garage and one installed on the front porch. nobody enters the property without being detected....when the system works that is. (for the orginal intent it worked and it has been as quiet as a graveyard around here since the city saw the security video(s)of the problem neighbor's kid and his friends causing problems and clamped down on them.) Initially the wilife system worked as advertised, very easy setup, and decent video quality but After a few months I started losing detection of the cameras by the software due to \"USB connection errors\". For the past 13 months I never knew when the system was going to fail. I have tried everything I can think of to get this system to work reliably but to no avail. I have uninstalled and re-installed the software countless times, downloaded the latest versions of the software and I have tried every usb plug on my computer. I even went so far as to install a new addon USB2 card but the \"USB\" connection errors\" persist. I have hve had no other issues with other USB peripherals installed on my computer.  I have searched the web looking for solutions, I have contacted Logitech tech support, all with no satisfaction. Sometimes if I unplug and replug the usb cable 15 or 20 times the system will stay on...for awhile. I'm sure many have had no problems with their Logitech Wilife system  and to you I say good for you. But to those of us who have had a multitude of problems with the Logitech Wilife system, we have suffered countles hours of maddening fustrations. If you choose to buy into the wilife system do so with the knowledge that it will be a \"hit or miss\" propostion regarding reliabity and once you spend your money you probably will not recover your investment if the return period has lapsed and you start to have problems. As for me, if I had it to do over again I would choose something else.On a final note. Let me put in a plug for Amazon.com. I have had nothing but a positive relationship with Amazon.com for the last six years or so that I have been buying from them. If and when I had a problem and had to return merchandise, for whatever reason if it was within the return time period Amazon would pay for the return with no hassle.
