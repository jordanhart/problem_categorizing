{"Reviews": [{"Title": "amazing resolution and low-light capture without flash", "Author": "Nelz", "ReviewID": "R3A54FL37M2TH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The few times that I've used this camera it had surprised me and everyone around me as to how well built it is. Aside from the ruggedness the resolution of the pictures, even in the Camera's LCD, is unlike I've ever seen on any compact digital camera. I took it to an Afrojack concert and the video quality of it in low light was remarkable. My friend's iPhone nor my android came close to that video quality. The pictures also didn't need any flash for things in the picture to be visible, from the light show, to the big screen flashing, to the crowd of people.The floating wrist strap made me comfortable when I took it with me while surfing. And the rest is good to have laying around for when you need it. A little pricy but completely worth it.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$289.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 13 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Pentax WG-3 Shock & Waterproof GPS Digital Camera (Green) + <2> Transcend 16GB Class 4 SD Card + <3> Spare Li-50B/D-LI92 Battery +\n<4> PD C190D Digital Camera Case + <5> Floating Foam Camera Strap + <6> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod +\n<7> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <8> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <9> HDMI to Micro-HDMI Cable +\n<10> PD Flexible Table Mini Tripod + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <13> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Pentax WG-3 Shock & Waterproof GPS Digital Camera (Green) with 16GB Card + Battery + Case + Tripods + Float Strap + HDMI Cable + Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wDHQyAiaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C2CP9YQ"}}
