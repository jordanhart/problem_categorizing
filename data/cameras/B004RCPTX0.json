With the price that I paid, I did not expect such high quality stuff. Highly recommended!", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "love/hate", "Author": "raelyn0511", "ReviewID": "R18GABPO9LSYPO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this package for the mini tripod and battery. I also used the screen protector on my camera and it has bubbles, but what can you do really, they don't give you something to control it. I thought the tripod would be much bigger, it's actually as tall as an iPod touch if you want to compare. I feel like it would've been bigger. I make videos for YouTube, and the tripod doesn't work for me, so now I have to purchase another. However, the battery is perfect of course.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$12.46", "Features": "NB-4L Rechargeable Lithium Ion Replacement Battery\nMini Table Top Tripod\nPack of LCD Screen Protectors\nLens/LCD Maintenance Cleaning Kit\n(See Description for Compatible Models)", "Name": "NB4L Lithium Ion Replacement Battery for Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS / ELPH 100 HS Digital Cameras DavisMAX Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zrmhz3lvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004RCPTX0"}}
