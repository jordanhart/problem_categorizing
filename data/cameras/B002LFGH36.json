It takes good and clear pictures. And has so many features that the other cameras don't have. I have not had any problems with my camera and would highly recommend this camera to all camera lovers. Only one little downfall, the battery goes quicker than other cameras but I assume that is because it is all touchscreen and would drain the battery quicker. Other than that I love it.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "solid camera", "Author": "kb", "ReviewID": "R2ZIQ7OOXB29QC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung TL 220 worked well for us on a recent trip.  It took great pictures, especially in low light.  We ended up turning off the flash for most pictures, even at night, and they came out better than with a flash.  Touch screen was responsive and easy to use.I was worried about battery life, and the battery indicator can sometimes be erratic, quickly going from fully charged to no charge in an instant, and then returning to fully charged.  I'm still not sure why that happened, but the battery did last through a couple of large museums (150 photos, most without flash).  I would still make sure the battery is fully charged each time before heading out.Couple other quirks:  the charging cord is very short and since you have to charge the battery while inside the camera, you have to search around for an outlet that's close to a surface where you can rest the camera.  The front screen is nice, but it made me wish I had longer arms in taking some of our self portrait shots to get all the desired background into the photo.  You also have to concentrate on looking at the lens, not the front screen, or your eyes will look off to the side in the photo.  The micro SD card is a bit of an inconvenience - a standard SD card would have been easier.All in all, we found the camera easy and fun to use, and we have some amazing photos from our trip.  Amazon service was great as well!", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung Dual-screen 12mp camera", "Author": "Rene Devon Singh", "ReviewID": "R1CBX9S4GB25X6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera arrived in satisfactory time and in good condition. The Samsung dual screen is an excellent camera the pictures are sharp and clear and the face recognition and image stabilization work great. The view screen is large and bright and doubles as a touch screen interface which is responsive but takes some getting use too. More thought could have been put into the manual because the instructions are vague and useless or total absent on using the numerous functions that the camera apparently has. Manual aside the camera is excellent and the outer screen is sheer genius. It allows for perfect self portraits and couples who don't want to hand their camera to a stranger every time they want an intimate picture while on a date. There are also settings which use the outer screens to help keep the attention of less than cooperative photo subjects (e.g. babies or ppl with short attention spans). All is all this camera is more than worth the price tag and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great point and shoot.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not reliable", "Author": "Strike Z \"Strike Z\"", "ReviewID": "RXXVPSKHHMTKD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera for our daughter.

I bought this for my daughter's 19th birthday a couple of weeks ago and she is still exploring all of it's numerous features.  The touchscreen is wonderful and the quality of the pictures are amazing.  I especially like the option to change the resolution of your pictures and the clear crisp quality of the pictures, also the lighting and color quality is that of a professional photographer's camera.  The only glitch I can mention is with the child mode feature Samsung offers on their website files to download videos and that is a little confusing but other than that it's great.  I do recommend however that you purchase this camera for a serious picture taker, I don't recommend this camera for a child or a very young teenager as it's many features may be overwhelming which may dissuade them from taking advantage of them.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super fun camera but not the best pictures", "Author": "Hoog", "ReviewID": "R2ECEY5AVQ0MWU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is really fun. The second view finder in front has been great. I use it all the time and I am already getting really good at positioning it for a great shot.All the extra features like smile finder, face recognition, and in-camera editing seem pretty useless to me but some might like them.BE WARNED: It takes a mini-SD card and at 12mp pictures you need a big one.Two disadvantages:1. The pictures are not as clear as I think they should be. I got better photos with my last pocket camera (Casio exlim), albeit cost twice as much. This is pretty important; it is a camera after all.2. It feels a little flimsy but it hasn't broken. It just feels a little less durable than me last one.Overall:If you're like me and want something that will fit in your front pocket and can come out anytime anywhere for family and friends photos this is a good choice. Plus with the view finder I get to be in a lot more of the photos.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "After 10 months of use I regret purchasing it!", "Author": "J9Detroit", "ReviewID": "R1OX54MVD6OEUV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm updating my initial review from March. I've been using this camera for 10 months now and I really have begun to hate it. I regret purchasing it and I'm considering selling it. I read a lot of reviews before I bought it and thought I was making a good decision but not anymore. So far any attempts at using the \"features\" of the camera have caused more problems then they're worth.  I've lost many pictures from my vacations and events due to file error which I don't realize until hours later when I decide to view the pictures I've taken.  These file errors usually happen when I try to use any of the features aside from the standard point and shoot. The camera is terrible at night shots. The flash is not strong enough and when you try to use the night/low light feature the picture doesn't even come out at all. The hook feature of taking a picture of yourself by using the view finder on the front of the camera to frame your shot doesn't work correctly and after many attempts at trying to get it right I've just given up. It's also been having problems freezing up on the screen after you take a picture and the front view finders stays stuck on even when you have turned it off.  Save your money and purchase one of the more reliable cameras - you'll be glad you did!*****************************************************I bought this camera mainly because I wanted the \"hook\" feature which is to take pictures of yourself by using the viewfinder on the front of the camera. I have to say that I'm not really crazy about the feature now that I have the camera.  Maybe I just need more practice to get it right but I found that the pictures I take that way are not right in terms of where you look into the camera to take the picture and the focus of the people in the picture. What I found though after using it was that I really like the camera overall. It's got some cool features and is very easy to use.  Some cons are: the price - it's definitely more expensive than many small point and shoot cameras out there and I'm sure that has more to do with that cool hook feature than anything else. It's a fingerprint magnet due to it's shiny surface. I really do miss having a view finder to look into in order to frame my shot vs. just the large viewer screen especially on sunny days because you have no idea what you're taking pictures of when there is a glare on the screen. The cord to charge it and download pictures to your computer is VERY short. Not sure why it's so short but it can be a huge problem if you're not close to the outlet you're plugging it into. If I plug it into the wall the camera will barely touch the floor. It's really THAT short. I thought the micro memory card would be a problem but it really hasn't been, mostly because instead of taking the card out to transfer pictures to your computer you actually just use the USB to connect to your computer for downloading. I wish it came with a full owners manual instead of having to download the pdf manual. I'm sure there are many features I haven't used yet just because I don't have that manual as a reference guide.  All in all it's a great little camera and it takes really good pictures. It's very slim and small and holds a battery charge for a fairly long time. Not sure the hook feature is worth the extra money though.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "K.

I wish I had returned it. I went and bought a new (and cheaper) Nikon which I use instead.Here were my problems with it:Once you push the button to take a picture, it takes a couple seconds to take it. This is a dealbreaker for me with a camera. The five-year-old camera that I was replacing took pictures immediately.The pictures have different dimensions than most cameras. So if you get your pictures developed at 4x6, you will either need to edit all the pictures first to crop them yourself, or risk peoples heads being chopped off. The dimensions are not a problem if you just look at your pictures on a computer. They are the dimensions of HDTV.The ONLY reason I bought this camera was because of the front display. I am going on vacation with my boyfriend and wanted to take great pictures of the two of us in front of the Eiffel tower, etc. This feature let me down because the touch screen is so large on the back that when I turn it around I tend to accidentally touch it and mess with the settings. Also, since it takes so long to take the picture, someone usually does something weird with their face before the picture actually takes.I did not find the use of this camera's menus, etc., to be intuitive. I am in my early twenties and can usually figure out new technology easily, and using this was frustrating.

If that's important to you, then this is your camera. To me it was a novelty as how hard is it to hop into a spot you have picked out for yourself in the picture? Or maybe folks who own this will take lots of pictures of themselves? I'm not sure.Anyway, reviewing the rest of the camera...this seems like a pretty mainstream 12MP digital camera. The touch screen didn't seem that much easier, if at all, to use than regular, well-designed menus. Photo quality was average with noise creeping in rapidly as the light diminished. I took a couple of side by side pictures with my older Canon SD550 and a new small Olympus (micro 4/3) DSLR. Not surprisingly image quality for this Samsung was in the middle, but not much better, even zoomed in, than the four year old Canon.So, unless the front LCD is important to you, I'd shop around and it could be that this camera is still your choice, but there are SO many options that it seems to me that the front LCD is the real selling point here.

The screen on the front was cool (the whole reason I got this camera, for kid mode) but the pics were so bad I just quit using it. I recently bought a Fujifilm Finepix 270 & it's awesome! Not too impressed with this camera...The picture quality was VERY disapointing & def not worth over $200!
