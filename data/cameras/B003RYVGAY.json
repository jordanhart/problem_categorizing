Well, a few months later and I've learned a LOT about photography. It took me a while, but now I see its limitations as well (no bracketing, no autofocus motor). However, I still think it's a great camera for someone that wants to get their feet wet and see if they like photography without too much of an investment. I've taken great pictures with it so that's what counts for me.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "great dslr", "Author": "rod h.", "ReviewID": "RPXSOBN9Q6T00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a great dslr upgrade from my Nikon d 40.. compact, easy to use and recommend to anyone looking into photography.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Used  Body", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "R396QAJADMQJIQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My D40 body was not functioning properly and I couldn't find a place for repair.
