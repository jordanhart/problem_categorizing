{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Compared to E-M5 (and E-M1)", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R1TJBPTE86M7VJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had an E-M5 for about a year which was terrific but a bit unwieldy both to handle and operate. I just dumped it for a GX7.First I'd like to focus on a few very positive differences in particular that make the GX7 SO much easier and more practical to use in a variety of circumstances than I found the E-M5.- First, the lack of a hump. I know people say they \"don't care\" - but really that doesn't make any sense. If you didn't care about the streamlined size, why would you buy a mirrorless camera? Anyway, it's more practical to stick this in a coat pocket than the E-M5, let alone the E-M1 whose hump makes it literally 1 inch (!) taller than the GX7. The GX7 is the most compact/streamlined body with a built-in viewfinder (EVF) in the m43rd's universe.- About the EVF. Many people have talked up how inferior it is to the Olympus VF-4 (which sits like a mountain atop the E-P5) or that on the E-M1 (which again adds a 1-inch hump). First off, I find it just as visually adequate as the E-M5 no major difference in my eyes (note that I don't wear glasses). But *functionally* it blows the E-M5 away. Why? Because of the autofocus selection mechanism. On the GX7 I position the autofocus point using the touch-screen *while* looking through the EVF. Ingenious (and a little EVF tilting, another great feature, plus using my right eye makes this practical). I can't tell you how many shots I missed on the E-M5 stupidly and painfully slowly trying to move the autofocus point around with the squishy cursor buttons while looking through the EVF. Ridiculous.- The wifi smart phone control (absent on E-M5). I have been to so many places where I would have loved to have gotten a picture of myself or myself and my travel companions but just couldn't because blind timer pictures are just so difficult. With smartphone control I literally see the screen on my smart-phone, can select the autofocus point, all the shooting settings, etc. Really a game-changer.- Autofocus mechanisms. The GX7's 1-area autofocus can be shrunk (*permantently* it remembers) to a very small area. Much smaller than on the E-M5. And at any rate, getting a smaller autofocus point on the E-M5 inexplicably required going into a separate \"mode\" where all of a sudden half the shooting settings become invisible and inoperable until you \"set\" the autofocus point. Again, I can't tell you how many shots with the E-M5 of eg animals I missed due to either the large autofocus point or having to waste time in the ridiculous autofocus-magnify mode. In addition, the GX7 has pinpoint autofocus which magnifies and is amazingly accurate - nothing like that on the E-M5.- Manual focusing. When you manual focus the GX7 pops up a magnified picture-in-picture over an area of your choosing (and again it remembers once you set the location and magnification of the PIP). Combined with focus peaking (absent on the E-M5) this is now much faster and more accurate and therefore I use it more, which is the most important thing.- Video! Video quality is outstanding on the GX7, while the compression codecs and quality on the E-M5 were basically not useful for anything fast-moving, way too many ugly artifacts.- Silent shutter. Boy do you get some ugly looks at quiet concerts when your mechanical shutter fires off. This is incredibly useful, opens up a whole new range of venues to photography for me, and is completely absent on the E-M5. But note that it only works up to ISO 3200 and is not appropriate for fast-moving subjects.- Built-in pop-up bounceable flash (the E-M5 has a large, cumbersome add-on flash that, in practice, I never brought with me. Carrying 4 lenses on a 15-mile hike is plenty to keep track of, thank you). No more dark faces outside in the sun. Plus bounceable means I normally don't have to shine it on people's faces indoors (which I dislike so much that I just go no-flash when that's the only option.- Bright light goodies. ISO 125 (instead of E-M5's 200) and max shutter speed of 1/8000s (instead of E-M5's 1/4000s) let me shoot my PL 25mm f/1.4 at f/1.4 significantly more often than I could before. Less need for an ND filter (which I never carry around anyway) or stopping down when I don't want to.Finally some neutral/negative comparisons.- The image quality of the GX7 is essentially identical to all current M43rd's cameras, including the Olympus E-M1, E-P5, and E-M5. There is literally no noticeable difference, end of story.- The GX7's in-body-stabilization (IBIS), the first on a Panasonic camera, is inferior to the Olympus high-end 5-axis. But many reviews have vastly overstated the useful advantage here. I get roughly 100% success at 1/10s using the 25mm f/1.4. That's just more than enough. Sure, I could go to 2/3s with the E-M5, but how often is that practical? Even leaves blowing in the wind get blurred at that speed!- The GX7 is not weather-sealed, the E-M5 is. Yet zero of my 6 lenses are weather-sealed...so how is that useful? My E-PL5 is also not weather-sealed, and I've taken it to the jungle. I guess I'm careful.- The GX7's battery life is not too impressive, the E-M5's was great.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fastest Gun in the West (Panasonic's Best Still M4/3 to date)", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R3KYD7L4WILJAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I have owned tons of M4/3 cameras (G1, GF1, GH1, GH2, G3, E-M5).  M4/3 are great cameras which are, in my opinion, the best choice for probably 95% of households looking for a large sensor camera.  Now let me start off by saying, if you are a fine arts photographer looking to print big or a commercial photographer looking to impress customers and print big then look elsewhere because these are not the cameras for you.  For just about everyone else who is looking for the best all around tool to capture their special moments then m4/3 is it.I am going to digress quite a bit here to discuss the sensor \"envy\" issue I have seen so much on the web  from both individuals and so called \"professional\" review sites.  The discussion actually turned in to a master's thesis so I will be presenting the condensed version before the review.  The detailed version will be at the end of the review for anyone interested.  And if sensor envy is not an issue for you or don't want to read about relative merits of sensors then skip down to the asterisk box for the start of the review.Is a FX sensor better than a m4/3?  Is a m4/3 sensor better than a FX?  The answer to both those questions is \"It depends.\"  Anyone who tries to give you a one size fits all answer either has no clue what they are talking about or are trying to sell you something.  I will attempt to try and explain the relative merits of each so you can make an informed decision.  I am really only going to discuss FX (AKA 35mm or mislabeled as full-frame.  Whatever that even really means as there are medium format cameras and large format cameras with much larger imaging circles.) as what I say about it will apply to DX to a lessor extent.The 4 major components of IQ are Resolution, Color Depth, Dynamic Range, and High ISO.  The best FX and DX cameras DxOMark scores exceed the best m43 yet tested (GX7 and EM1 have not been tested).  However,  the m4/3 scores of 2012 are about equal to the 2006 35mm Canon 1Ds MkII.  This was top-of-the-line pro-camera that cost $8000 and at 16.7mp was the first 35mm digital DSLR considered capable of shooting double-truck ads for national magazines.  (A comment I want to make concerning High the ISO numbers.  I am not sure how these are computed or relate to each other.  I shot with the 1Ds MkII extensively and I can without a doubt say the files from the EM5 look better than the 1Ds Mk II at 6400 ISO.  Also, you can go to DPReview and see 100% magnified files shot at various ISOs and various cameras.  The files from the D800  look to me about 1 to 1.5 stops better than the EM5.  That is the D800 files at 6400 look the same with regard to noise as EM5 shot at 3200.)  The m43 or 2012 also easily outclasses the DX sensor Nikon D300 a $1600 prosumer camera from 2008.  If all you care about is IQ and you need all that IQ, then by all means the D800 is even better than the best medium format except in color depth (used for portraits) so get the D800.However, the IQ of sensors, long ago exceeded what we need for home use.  So the fact of the matter is, most people don't need the IQ of the D800 and there are, to me, more relevant reasons why the D800 is not something most people would even like.  The first is 36mp files.  Shot in 14bit RAW, you are looking at around a 65MB image file.  Roughly, 15 of those images make 1GB.  Even the JPEGs are huge around 15MB each.  That is a pain to store and a pain to process.  What do most people do with their images?  I would say the number one thing people do is is to put them on the web or their phones.  The biggest monitors are around 2.5mp.  To print a 300dpi 8x10 requires around 7mp.  That means if you view the picture on a 2.5mp monitor you giving up 33.5mp.  (This is not entirely accurate as the image is interpolated down and you do clean up noise when you do that.)  And that is for a full screen image not the little happy snaps you text or put on facebook which are more likely to be around 1mp or less.  Do you really think you need 36mp?  If so, then m4/3 is not the right format for you.  I mentioned earlier, that when you downsize an image it is interpolated down and this helps clean up the image.  Well that applies to the m4/3 images as well.  So even though the D800 is 1 to 1.5 stops better for noise, when you interpolate the images down, you are very unlikely to be able to see that on your screen or even on a print except at ISOs greater than 6400.  So the FX sensor has better IQ than m4/3 but for most people it just doesn't matter because the m4/3 sensors are more than good enough for tasks most people use cameras for.  As a fun test, I have posted 3 images from the GX7 under the customer images.  One was shot at ISO200, one ISO6400 and one was shot at ISO25,600 (That is a whopping 7 stops of ISO difference.  So if 1 or 2 stops really mattered you should see a huge difference in 7 stops.).  See if you can tell which is which.  I will say at full screen on my 27 inch monitor I can tell the difference between them.  However, the 25,600 still looks really really good and is very usable for web images.  The difference between ISO 200 and 6400 is not really noticeable.  If they weren't side-by-side you wouldn't even be able to tell one was shot at 6400.So what are the downsides of FX sensors.  The first and most obvious is price.  However, the other costs associated with the FX sensor are the lenses.  The best lenses are very expensive.  Also, the imaging circle of a FX is roughly 2x the size of the imaging circle of m4/3.  That means, the lenses are going to be bigger and heavier and the difference is not trivial.  A D800 with a 70-200mm f.28 is going to set you back about $5300 and around 6-7lbs.  A GX7 with a 35-100mm f/2.8 will set you back about $2300 and around 3lbs.  If you are traveling somewhere and carrying your camera all day, can you see how the smaller sensor might be better for you?  Something to think about.Next, the contrast autofocus use by m4/3 is on the sensor and it is exceedingly fast.  What this means, is you have focusing points throughout your frame.  The phase detect systems used on FX DSLRs only has points clustered around the middle; the corners are excluded.  Also, the phase detect systems are separate from the sensor.  Therefore, with FX you have back focusing and front focusing issues.  The so called live view systems on the DSLRs are really the only accurate way to auto or manual focus and are terribly slow.  That means the only way to quickly frame and focus a FX DSLR is through the viewfinder.  Forget holding the camera over your head or down at your feet.The next issue is with dust on the sensor.  With all my DX and FX sensors DSLRs, dust has always been an issue (Talk about a way to ruin IQ).  However, in almost 5 years shooting m4/3, I have never had one single problem with dust on the sensor.  Another \"benefit\" of FX is the shallower Depth of Field that can be achieved for the same aperture.  The reason I put that in quotes is that in a lot of cases the DOF on a FX is too shallow and you need to stop down the lens to f4 or f5.6 to get the DOF you are looking for.  In these cases, a m4/3 is clearly superior as you can stay at f2 or f2.8 to get the same DOF.  That means you can turn your ISO down 2 stops (From my perspective on the high ISO images I viewed on DPReview, a 100% EM5 image at 1600 looks better than a 100% D800 6400 image).  Also, for flash or lighting for video filming, a 2 stop ISO difference means 4 times less light power is required for the m4/3 sensor. That means your flash batteries will last longer and your flash will recycle that much quicker.Another drawback of the FX sensor is it is stuck in the archaic 2:3 ratio which is not as friendly for printing as a 4:3 ration is.  To print a 4:5 ration 8x10 from a 2:3 ratio there is quite a bit of cropping to be done and often a picture won't fit.Finally, the pixel densities on m4/3 are the highest of any large sensor camera.  A DX sensor with the same pixel density as a 16mp m4/3 sensor would be roughly 32mp and a FX sensor would be 64mp.  This is both good and bad for m4/3 cameras.  Currently, there are no DX or FX sensors with pixel densities of the m4/3.  So you are currently getting more reach on your m4/3 lenses than any other lenses.  What this means is, given the same focal length, you are getting approximately 1.5x the data on a subject for the same area than an FX and 1.25 vs a DX sensor.  This is not to be confused with crop factor which based on the sensor size is 2x compared to FX sensor and 1.5x compared to a DX sensor. This does come with a downside to the m4/3 in that it works your lenses harder (exposes optical flaws in the lenses) and you hit diffraction limits on IQ at around F8 vice F11.Buy 35mm FX if:- You need the best image quality available to print big.  At 200 dpi (good enough for most people) you can print a 16mp image up to 23x17.  If you need bigger than that, get a FX.- You absolutely have to have the shallowest DOF available in a DSLR body.  I've owned FX camera bodies and I will admit sometimes I do miss the razor shallow DOF images I was occasionally able to capture.  With that, however, the DOF was so small I often missed the focus especially on wiggly subjects such as kids.  Also, with 2 or more people, DOF at 1.4 was way too shallow so forget about it. With my 75mm 1.8, I don't miss FX as much as my pictures from that lens have a very similar feel as the FX pictures.  I liked the D700 a lot but the fact of the matter is, I used my GH1 far more.- You have to have the biggest sensor to feel good about yourself. (And, really, you will still need MF)***********************************************************************************  Start Review Here**********************************************************************************Ok I am off my sensor soapbox and will now get back to the GX7.  One of the big deals about the GX7 is it is the first and only ranger-finder style camera (note: it is not a range-finder camera).  What this means is you shoot with your right eye one the EVF, the camera is not resting on your face.  (It reminds me a lot of the X100 but only much faster and easier to use).  The big benefit of this, however, is it leaves your left eye well clear of the camera and able to scan the scene for the right moment to shoot.  I am left eye dominant and at first blush that would appear to be a drawback.  However, having your dominant eye be the one scanning the scene is a major benefit in my opinion.  This setup is one reason I like the rangefinder style cameras such as the GX7.  This is the camera either Panasonic or Olympus should have built well before there even was and X100 or NEX 7.  To me it felt instantly comfortable and fun to use like an old friend.The single autofocus on this camera is blazing fast.  It is the fastest single shot autofocus I have ever used.  With the 25mm f/1.4 it is near instantaneous in good light.  However, it is the low light performance which really blows me away.  In a dark room at night with the only light bleeding in through an open door, the GX7 was as fast as many autofocus systems in bright light.  Here is the amazing thing, there was no hunting or searching.  It is very noticeably faster than any other autofocus system I have ever used in low-light by a wide margin!  I have to say using the EM1 was disappointing as it hunted, searched, and took about 3-4 times as long.  Not that the EM1 was bad it is about standard for what I have used.  The GX7 is just plain faster.  For night shooting, or low-light event photography I don't think you will find a better auto focus system out there for single shot.  Tracking focus does not live up to single shot but I don't really use tracking focus.  Another nice feature dealing with autofocus is you can have the camera start to focus when it senses your eye at the EVF.  If you have this turned on in the menu, and you get used to it by making sure you are pointing at your subject as you raise the camera to your eye, the subject can be in focus when your eye reaches the EVF.Wow what a nice camera.  M4/3 have been a little hobbled in my opinion in the past with a crappy 1/160 flash sync and a lame 1/4000 fastest shutter speed.  Well that is past with the GX7.  It has a flash sync speed of 1/320 which is I believe faster than any DSLR which top out at 1/250.  Not really fast enough to get really excited about but fast enough to be useful.  The camera also has a built in little fill flash which is handy for daylight shooting.  The 1/8000 max shutter speed is also welcome as I like to shoot wide open primes in bright light and don't like toting around ND filters.  Additionally, this is Panasonic's first m4/3 camera with In-body Stabilization (IBIS).  I don't feel it is a good as the one on the E-M5 but it does work with any lenses which don't have stabilization such as Leica, Nikon, Voigtlander, etc.  Shooting the 75mm f/1.8 handheld at 1/10, I got around 50% non-blurry images.  Which is pretty decent since the minimum I should be shooting that is 1/160.  That is about a 4 stop advantage.  Shooing with the EM1, however, all the images were good.It is unfortunate that neither Panasonic nor Olympus are building bodies with 2 card slots in them.  Two cards are really nice for paid events for redundancy incase one card dies on you.  This camera also, has built in wifi and NFC.  One reviewer mentioned it was exceedingly difficult to set up.  My experience was completely different.  I downloaded the app from Goggle Play store and then followed the instructions in the manual.  I was up and running with both wifi and NFC in about 5 min.  Now with that said, I don't think wifi is going to be that useful for me.  If you need to remotely control a camera then it would be ok.  I could see a portrait studio having the camera set up on a tripod and using the phone to trigger the camera.  The reason I say this is ok is that the focus seemed really slow.  Also, it can transfer photos to your phone to upload to the web, so if that is something you have been waiting for then this will be useful for you.  For me, I doubt I will use it.  As an aside, the EM1 was even easier to set up and includes an additional feature of geo-tagging you photos with your phones GPS coordinates.  This is something I might actually use.M4/3 cameras are so small and light that I use them with a wrist strap instead of a neck strap.  It is kind of a shame that neither Panasonic nor Olympus have figured this out yet either.  I saw one reviewer commenting on how you need two hands to shoo this camera.  I don't think that is true.  While the grip is not as steady as the EM1, I can shoot the 75 f/1.8 comfortably one handed all day.  With, the wrist grip on you don't worry about it.  Just keep it in your hand.The build quality of this camera is top notch.  Panasonic's best so far.  It has a quality fell and weight to it and is a real pleasure to hold.  The grip is nice enough but I prefer a bigger grip when using the bigger lenses such as the 100-300.  The EM1 grip is a lot better in my opinion.  The switches all feel really nice.  As far as handling goes, I feel Panasonic's handling is far superior to DSLRs.  To me DSLRs are like dinosaurs compared to the Panasonic's.  I always liked the push to click adjustment wheel on previous Panasonic so I am sad to now see a 2 wheel system.  With the one wheel, I always knew what I needed to do and could make it happen with out looking.  Changing exposure value was so easy.  With 2, I always forget which one does shutter and which one does aperture.  Panasonic always got bashed, by so called people in the know, for only having 1 wheel so now we get 2.  Too bad in my opinion as the new system is far inferior to the G1, GH1, GF1, GH2, G3, etc.  The setup used to be everything was viewed at once in terms of exposure data (Shutter speed, aperture, and EV).  Now when you press on the wheel, shutter speed and aperture go away and all you have is EV.  Boo to Panasonic for listening to so called experts who don't recognize an improvement when they see one because it is different.  The quick menu system works great and the touchscreen is useful.  Panasonic used to have the best handling going but I am now going to have to say the Olympus EM1 handles better than the GX7.One thing I have found is if you are using the back screen and you are holding the camera on the left, it is easy to trip the eye sensor and have the back screen shut off.  The solution for this is either to make sure to flip the EVF up when using the back screen or adjust the sensitivity down to low in the menus.Speaking of EVF, this 2.4 million dot EVF is beautiful.  Many pros sites say they prefer the view from a large FX prism.  In most cases I actually prefer EVF.  For one thing it covers the full frame.  For another it actually magnifies the picture better.  But for me the big thing is it is somewhat What You See Is What You Get.  That means if you set a manual WB and then forgot to change it when you changed settings, you will see that in the EVF as the picture will look either to yellow or blue.  I use it as a very fast method of setting exposure.  Move the light sources around in the frame until you see the exposure you want and then lock it in.  Recompose and shoot.  This is an exceedingly fast way to play with your exposure.  Tired of taking pictures with people too dark because of a bright background.  You will see that in the EVF.  If you want a Silhouette then you can see that before you shoot.  This is actually less likely to happen with the GX7 because the facial recognition and facial exposure works exceedingly well.I do need to mention an occurrence I just had happen on AWB with the GX7.  I was shooting low light sunlight through a gold curtain which makes the light orange.  In the EVF the image looked great, however, the JPEGs were way too orange.  I reset the WB to incandescent and the images looked fine.  The EM1 images looked great even in the strange light.  Also, I remember seeing some test images that looked too yellow on a review web site.  No one has reported any AWB issues with this camera, but I would make sure to check your photos in weird light.  You might need to use a manual WB.  This is an issue that Panasonic can and should be able to fix with a firmware update.All in all this is a fantastic little camera, that handles beautifully, takes great pictures, and is, in my opinion, the best all around camera for most people.  Since the E-M1 is about to come out I will comment about that also.  In most cases, this camera being $500 cheaper is the better way to go.  IQ is the same, features that are important to most people are the same and you save a ton of cash.  There are a few situations where the E-M1 might be better for you than the GX7.  1)  If you have 4/3 lenses, the E-M1 is a no brainer.  If you don't know what I am talking about you don't have any.  2)  If you need the extra battery life of the grip or you take tons of portrait orientation pictures, the E-M1 is the way to go.  If you want the best IBIS in any camera system, that will be in the EM1 (I nailed 100% 75mm shots at 1/10 of a second.  I've seen talk of being able to shoot at 1sec hand held.  I will update when I test that).  If you want the most weather sealed m4/3 camera that will also be the EM1.Pros:Very Fast Auto Focus (Best low light I have every shot.)Range-finder Style CameraBuild QualityImage QualityIBISSmallHandlingLen SystemCons:AWB needs a Firmware Fix.  In some rare instances it gets confused and is too orange.Only one SD slotMore expensive than NEX6 and cheaper DSLRsBelow is a buying guide recommendation.Panasonic GX7 - Panasonic's best still camera to date - Great construction, 1/320 flash sync, 1/8000 shutter speed, blazing fast focus, WIFI, IBS, focus peeking, great handling, etc.  This camera does cost $150 more than the NEX-6, which is similarly specked (Sony must be giving them away).  However, m4/3 lenses are always going to be quite a bit smaller and lighter than NEX lenses.  Additionally, the m4/3 lens system is the most complete outside of legacy 35mm systems from Nikon and Canon.Panasonic G6 - Great little camera for a nice price ($740 with lens).  IQ not quite as good as the GX7, build quality not as good as GX7, and has slower flash sync and shutter speed.  It has a tilt and swivel screen which in my opinion is actually nicer than the tilt only screen on the GX7, EM5, and EM1.  If you want to get into the system, this is a good way to start.  Save money on the camera and spend it on a nice lens.Panasonic G5 - Right now if you look for the clearance sales you can get them for $300-400.  Not as good as any of the other cameras here but still a great camera which takes nice pictures.Olympus E-M1 - Looks to be an absolutely brilliant camera.  If you have 4/3 lenses (not to be confused with m4/3) this camera is a no brainer as it is a huge upgrade over the E-5.  The camera has the best in-body stabilization (IBIS) of any camera period.  Also, for event photographers, the additional battery grip is a must for better battery life.  However, at $1400 if you don't have legacy 4/3 lenses and have no plans to get any, and you don't need the battery grip, then the GX-7 is $500 cheaper and almost as good.  (Although, the GX7 doesn't have as good IBIS).Olympus E-M5 - this camera has now been outclassed by the GX-7 and costs the same.  So while this is still a brilliant camera, the GX-7 is better for the same money.Olympus E-P5 - Has no built in view finder which for me is an absolute no go.  If you add the external viewfinder, you have now paid $1500 which is more than the EM-1.  And add on accessories always get lost.  (I can never find my E-M5 flash)  So this camera is way overpriced (as all of the EP cameras have been) and I don't recommend it.  Get either the GX-7 or EM-1NEX-6 - Really nice camera - Focus is not as fast a m4/3.  Sensor is bigger so for higher ISO and large sizes, it will have better IQ.  Price is great.  However, this camera does not handle as well as the Panasonic.  While the camera is small, the lenses are not so this system is not as small and light as the m4/3.  The lens system is nowhere near complete as the m4/3 system.  If price is your only consideration, then the NEX-6 is probably the way to go.  If size and weight are the primary consideration, the GX-7 is the way to go.Any DSLR -  Bigger and heaver - DSLRs are dinosaurs when compared to mirrorless cameras.  I really hate going back from shooting my E-M5 and shooting my Nikons.  They are big, the focus system is obsolete (not phase focus, but the focus points and how they are arranged).  Their, live view is terrible, most of the viewfinders are smaller then the newest EVFs, and are lacking some of the features of the mirrorless.  Tons of people buy Nikon and Canon because that is what is around,  however, my opinion is the vast majority of families would be much better served by a m4/3 system.  If you know why some of the DSLR features are better than m4/3 then a DSLR may be for you.  However, if you are looking to step up from your phone and get a camera to take pictures of your family and daily life, then m4/3 is the system for you.  If you really need, shallow DOF, then full-frame may be the way to go.  As far as event photographers go, we often shoot at f/4 or f.5/6 to get the DOF we need.  With m4/3, you can shoot f/2 or f/2.8 to get the same DOF so you can shoot 2 stops lower ISO.  The DSLRs have 2 card slots which is very nice, however, with WIFI, you can shoot with your GX7 or E-M1 and upload to your phone while taking pictures. DSLRs also have a better battery life.*********************************************************************************** Start thesis on Sensor Size**********************************************************************************Is a FX sensor better than a m4/3?

D800 36mp, 25.3 bit color depth, 14.4 Stop Dynamic Range and 2853 ISO.  For D7100 it is 24mp, 24.2, 13.7 and 1256.  For EP5, 16mp, 22.8, 12.4, 895.  Higher is \"better\" and so by numbers the IQ of the FX D800 is best.  (I am using the EP5 because there is not DxOMark Score for the GX7.  Before, we move on to some other items concerning sensor, let me show you the numbers for the 2006 35mm Canon 1Ds MkII.  Before I show them to you, you need to know this was a pro-camera that cost $8000 when it came out and at 16.7mp was the first 35mm digital considered capable of shooting double-truck ads for national magazines.  Here are the numbers for this camera 16mp, 23.3, 11.3, 1480.  So, based on objective numbers, the m43 sensor of today is about equivalent of the camera used for pro work in 2006 to 2008.  It actually has a better dynamic range than the 35mm camera does.  (A comment I want to make concerning the ISO numbers.  I am not sure how these are computed or relate to each other.  I shot with the 1Ds MkII extensively and I can without a doubt say the files from the EM5 look better than the 1Ds Mk II at 6400 ISO.  Also, you can go to DPReview and see 100% magnified files shot at various ISOs and various cameras.  The files from the D800  look to me about 1 to 1.5 stops better than the EM5.  That is the D800 files at 6400 look the same with regard to noise as EM5 shot at 3200.)  Just for info purposes here are some of numbers from some other older cameras I shot with.  Canon 30D 10mp, 21.5, 10.8, 736 and Nikon D300, 12mp, 22.1, 12, 679.  As you can see the EP5 outclasses both of those cameras based on the numbers and yet I got really nice pictures with both those cameras. (Going back to that ISO number again, I shot extensively with both of those cameras and their files at ISO 800 were about the same as the EM5 at 6400. The EM5 is about 3 stops better yet the DxOMark ISO values are about the same.  Also, the EM5 6400 JPEGs are sharp and clean.  Very nice.)  If all you care about is IQ and you need all that IQ, then by all means the D800 is even better than the best medium format except in color depth used for portraits so get the D800.However, as I showed you with the 1Ds MkII, the IQ of sensors, long ago exceeded what we need for home use.  So the fact of the matter is, most people don't need the IQ of the D800 and there are, to me, more relevant reasons why the D800 is not something most people would even like.  The first is 36mp files.  Shot in 14bit RAW, you are looking at around a 65MB image file.  Roughly, 15 of those images make 1GB.  Even the JPEGs are huge around 15MB each.  That is a pain to store and a pain to process.  What do most people do with their images?  I would say the number 1 thing people do is is to put them on the web or their phones.  The biggest monitors are around 2.5mp.  To print a 300dpi 8x10 requires around 7mp. Requires.  That means if you view the picture on a 2.5mp monitor you giving up 33.5mp.  (This is not entirely accurate as the image is interpolated down and you do clean up noise when you do that.)  That is for a full screen image not the little happy snaps you text or put on facebook which are more likely to be around 1mp or less.  Do you really think you need 36mp?  If so, then m4/3 is not the right format for me.  I personally, like the 10-12mp range (and wish they would make a 12mp m43) but 16mp is more than enough for me.  I mentioned earlier, that when you downsize an image it is interpolated down and this helps clean up the image.  Well that applies to the m4/3 images as well.  So even though the D800 is 1 to 1.5 stops better for noise, when you interpolate the images down, you are very unlikely to be able to see that on your screen or even on a print except at ISOs greater than 6400 or maybe 3200.  So I think we have established the FX sensor has better IQ than m4/3 but I hope I have established for most people it just doesn't matter because the m4/3 sensors are more than good enough for tasks most people use cameras for.As a fun test, I have posted 3 images from the GX7 under the customer images.  One was shot at ISO200, one ISO6400 and one was shot at ISO25,600.  See if you can tell which is which.  I will say at full screen on my 27 inch monitor I can tell the difference between them.  However, the 25,600 still looks really really good and is very usable for web images.  The difference between ISO 200 and 6400 is not really noticeable.  If they weren't side-by-side you wouldn't even be able to tell on was shot at 6400.So what are the downsides of FX sensors.  The first and most obvious is price, although with Nikon's D600 fiasco, you can get a FX sensor for around $1500.  However, the other costs associated with the FX sensor are the lenses.  The best lenses are very expensive.  Also, the imaging circle of a FX is roughly 2x the size of the imaging circle of m4/3.  That means, the lenses are going to be bigger and heavier and the difference is not trivial.  A D800 with a 70-200mm f.28 is going to set you back about $5300 and around 6-7lbs.  A GX7 with a 35-100mm f/2.8 will set you back about $2300 and around 3lbs.  I can and have carried 4 m4/3 bodies with 2 fast zooms and 2 fast primes in the same bag I can only carry 2 DSLR bodies and lenses.  I also carried several extra lenses in that bag.  The weight of that bag, bodies, lenses, and iPad was 10lbs.  Two FX bodies and fast zooms alone are going to weigh more than that.  If you really feel like you want to lug all that around, then by all means get the FX.  All that weight also means you will be carrying around a heavier tripod if you use one. Do you think if maybe you had to hike your camera in somewhere that maybe the smaller sensor might be better?  If you are traveling somewhere and carrying your camera all day, can you see how the smaller sensor would be better?  Something to think about.Next, the contrast autofocus use by m4/3 is on the sensor and it is exceedingly fast.  What this means, is you have focusing points throughout your frame.  The phase detect systems used on FX DSLRs only has points clustered around the middle.  The corners are excluded.  Also, the phase detect systems are separate from the sensor.  Therefore, with FX you have back focusing and front focusing issues.  The so called live view systems on the DSLRs are really the only accurate way to auto or manual focus and is terribly slow (What you see thought the prism is not what the sensor is seeing it is what the autofocus is seeing.)  That means the only way to quickly frame and focus a FX DSLR is through the viewfinder.  Forget holding the camera over your head or down at your feet.The next issue is with dust on the sensor.  With all my DX and FX sensors DSLRs, dust has always been an issue (Talk about a way to ruin image quality).  It was so bad on the D600 they have had to significantly drop the price on that camera.  In almost 5 years shooting m4/3, I have never had 1 single problem with dust on the sensor.Another \"benefit\" of FX is the shallower Depth of Field that can be achieved for the same aperture.  The reason I put that in quotes is that in a lot of cases the DOF on a FX is too shallow and you need to stop down the lens to f4 or f5.6 to get the DOF you are looking for.  In these cases, a m4/3 is clearly superior as you can stay at f2 or f2.8 to get the same DOF.  This means you are collecting 4 times the light and, therefore, you can turn your ISO down 2 stops (According to the images on DPReview, a 100% EM5 image at 1600 looks better than a D800 6400 image).  Also, for flash or lighting for video filming, a 2 stop ISO difference means 4 times less light power is required for the m4/3 senso", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another winner for Panasonic... along with the GH3", "Author": "Bach_To_Rock", "ReviewID": "RSNKJWRJLP01T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's been a nice journey with the M43 system owning in order...

I even love the fact that Panasonic didn't choose to make it retro like Olympus or Fujifilm. It is what it is and doesn't try to be anything else. Since Panasonic first came out with a micro 4/3 camera in 2008 I've been waiting for this camera. It fits my wants perfectly. It's not the best in any category but it's almost there in almost every one. The Sony NEX offers better dynamic range and Fujifilm X-trans models offers better low light performance. The GH3 offers better video with jacks for microphone and headset. The Olympus EM-1 offers weather proofing and better in camera stabilization. None of them give me the exact package that the GX7 does when it comes to external controls, portability and ergonomics. That's not to say that other cameras wouldn't fit you better. There are some excellent choices out there.Plusses:*In body image stabilization.*Super fast focus.*Wi-Fi (It has NFC for supposedly easy connection. My iPhone won't do that so I can't comment on ease)*Will focus in very dark conditions. (not quite as quickly but very accurately)*Good video quality (try the black and white setting at 24 FPS for an old time movie look!)*Lots of external controls.*Very good image quality, as good as the EM-5 or GH3.*Built in EVF and a good one that tilts up.*Tilting LCD screen.*Excellent build.*Excellent hand grip.*Flash shoe.*3 User programmable settings on mode dial.****It just feels good in the hands!!Minuses:*Stabilization doesn't work in video mode (unless you have a stabilized lens).*The strap rings are too low on the side and get in the way of hands, especially the left one.*No auto ISO in manual mode. (Fuji has it. Sony doesn't.)*No microphone jack for use in video, though the stereo built in mics are pretty good for casual vids.*No weatherproofing, though no other rangefinder competitor has it either.*All the programmable buttons may overwhelm the less experienced.*Not good for sports shooting, though I don't know anyone who has used a rangefinder style camera for sports anyway.I listed a number of minuses but don't consider any of them a big deal. Your mileage may vary. Bottom line, this is the camera I've been waiting for and I'm not disappointed in any way.P.S. A more personal take.The camera's grip is shaped such that I hold my right elbow closer to my chest than with the squarish grip on my NEX camera, which tends to push my elbow out and up. With a camera this light that's probably not a big deal but may make for a more stable shot.I'm not particularly impressed with the stabilization. It's a step in the right direction and does help but it is nowhere near as nice as Olympus OM-D, which I've rented. Since I haven't shot it for about 4 years all I can do is guess, but I'd say it's about as effective as a Pentax K20D, which is 3 generations old. It's better than nothing and helps when using an old model Panasonic 20mm. I'm glad to have it. I wouldn't count on it for handholding a long lens. Since I don't have one, again, that's a guess.The buttons have a nice positive feel and are sufficiently far apart that I can hit the right one without worrying about it. I've been playing with the buttons while watching videos, which is how I normally learn a camera. Since I've only had this for 4 days I don't have the layout worked into muscle memory.It's the same with the menu system. I have a Nikon D600 and a Sony NEX 6. I'm going to sell the NEX as it does much the same thing as I intend for the GX7. The menus make more sense than Sony's which can require multiple dips into them to change some things like using extended dynamic range. Also, compared to the NEX, I'd say that the Panasonic has better jpegs and a better metering system. That said, there are a lot of potential ways to program the many function buttons and I'm going to be a while getting the camera set up just the way I want.I also like the GX7s ability to use a phone as a Wi-Fi remote. Sony does that too but requires the purchase of separate apps for different functions. The Sony is also slower when using the phone as a remote. It takes longer to focus and has a shutter lag. I haven't noticed that with the GX7.I like shooting a small camera with primes and Sony has a lack of focal length equivalents lower than 50mm. There are some Zeiss ones that are good but they are bulky and expensive.  The M43 choices are much more extensive and the lenses are much smaller and less costly, so the total package is smaller and lighter and less expensive. I've been shooting mostly with the Panny 20mm, which seems made for this camera. Next up is the Olympus 12mm, but that's expensive and I'll have to save for it.What more can I say? This camera is fun to shoot. It just feels right in my hands. That's such a subjective point and may be totally different for others. Everything is fast. It turns on fast, focuses fast, allows me to shoot a number of shots in quick succession and doesn't bog down. I don't use the burst mode. I wish the GX7 had a true 100 ISO mode as I sometimes to take longer exposures in daylight. I'll just need a stronger ND filter to to so than I have.I've printed a couple of photos from the GX7 at 13X19. That's as big as my printer will go. I can't tell any difference at that size between the GX7 and the NEX 6 at ISO 200 or 800. I do prefer the 4x3 format rather than the 3x2 of an APS sensor. It's closer in shape to the 11x14 inch or 16x20 inch frames that are easy to pick up at Michael's or Target.One thing I didn't mention in the review is how the camera is totally silent when using the electronic shutter. Turn that off and the camera turns off all other sounds. I think of it as stealth mode. Us that with the touch shutter on the view screen and it's possible to take photos and nobody has a clue. I do mostly street or documentary shooting and I love that ability.

I currently have an Olympus OMD EM5 and am overall happy with it.  I love the size of the micro four thirds system.  I can fit a body and plenty of lenses in one shoulder bag and not have it weighing me down.  As much as i loved the EM5 i found the button size/placement to be a little awkward.  So i decided i'd give something else a shot. I already had an EM1 on preorder but when i started looking more into the GX7 i became intrigued and finally decided i had to at least give it a try.  Let me say that i am glad that i did.  I would say that so far the only thing that this thing doesn't do that the EM1 does is keep out the rain!  Yeah the OMD is weather sealed but i am usually too afraid to test it and most of my favorite glass isn't anyways rendering the weather seal of the body useless.So what do i like about this camera;- size/ergonomics;  it feels very good in the hand, the buttons and knobs are in good positions and a lot are customizable.- focus speed;  while i'm not about to try to compare how many milliseconds difference there is between my EM5 and the GX7 it is very fast- touch focus; i LOVE being able to be looking through the viewfinder and just drag my thumb around the lcd to move my focus point- sizable focus points; finally!!! i can make my focus points smaller! (pinpoint focus mode is also pretty cool.  haven't used it much but seems useful)- viewfinder; i really like the rangefinder style cameras.  I like that the viewfinder is to the side and i don't have to smear my nose all over the LCD to use it.  The viewfinder is also very high quality.  I find it large enough (haven't seen the VF4 from Olympus but i hear it is awesome and i can't compare the two)- I CAN PROGRAM THE AF/AE BUTTON TO ACTIVATE AUTOFOCUS!!!!! brings me back to my Nikon DSLR days...- image quality;  i put my panaleica 25mm 1.4 on as soon as the camera was unwrapped and it hasn't moved since.  The pair produces some phenomenal images.  Trust me you DON'T need full frame cameras to produce images with good subject isolation and pleasant bokeh.  Yes...it is better with full frame but you can do very well with micro four thirds with the right glass.  High ISO performance seems very good so far as well.  I think i've gone up to 1600 so far and have no complaints with the the results.What don't i like;- WiFi; i was able to get the camera linked up to my iphone fairly easy but the app was useless.  I was able to take one shot and then it would freeze up and i'd have to close and reopen. This is more of a gimmicky thing to me.  I'm sure it would come in handy once in a while but it's no deal breaker.- color: why couldn't i get the black version now??? :)So i would say that i am very pleased with this camera so far.  It has exceeded my expectations and i am seriously considering canceling my EM-1 preorder.

I was seriously considering the Nikon D5200, but went with the m43 format and this camera. The pros for me outweighed the cons. I decided to go with prime lenses as I wanted to be sure I could confidently get a good enough picture quality at a decent price and from what I've read, primes are the way to go.I bought the camera with a 25mm prime (http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Lumix-Micro-SUMMILUX-Aspherical/dp/B0055N2L22) which first off, is not a cheap lens. If I were buying today, I would likely go for the Olympus 25mm (http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-25mm-f1-8-Interchangeable-Lens/dp/B00HWMP0XG) as this provides comparable quality at a cheaper price. I love the sharpness and focal length of 25mm. After shooting a few events with this, I went ahead and got 2 more prime lenses to get a decent \"trifecta\" of focal lengths.14mm - http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-14mm-2-5-Aspherical-Interchangeable/dp/B0043VE29C45mm - http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Digital-Silver-Panasonic-Cameras/dp/B0058PL9QGPros:- Small and light.

I can get about 300-400 shots on a single charge. I am wanting to take timelapse photos for extended periods of time but am limited by the battery life. On that note, I find it odd that you have to rotate the screen to get to the micro usb port.- Longest exposure is 1 second.

If I compare image quality GX7, it is only marginally better, and there are no breakthrough improvements in controls or lens feel. Where GX7 shines is when combined with a pancake lens (I have the 1.7f I bought 5 years ago) - because of body image stabilization in GX7, when combined with a my pancake 1.7f aspherical lens, GX7 can take exceptional photos in low light, better than most/all APC sensor cameras I've tried.

There really wasn't any middle ground between these extremes, until around 2011, when manufacturers started making higher- quality compact cameras with interchangeable lenses.Of all these incompatible systems, the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) format currently has the most backers and lenses, so this new Panasonic was a promising candidate in my attempt to retire both my DSLR and the point-n-shoot.-------------------  PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS: **** (4 of 5) -------------------The camera is about the same size as old film rangefinders, which makes it just about not pocketable, even when paired with a pancake lens. But it's a good size to use with both hands (right hand on the grip, left one under the lens). It's possible to use it single-handedly, but at almost 1.2 lbs even with the lightweight kit lens, I end up curling my pinky finger underneath the body to support it. So to me this Panasonic is a two- hands camera just like an SLR. That said, the weight and size advantage is very noticeable: on my first city walkaround with a shoulder strap, I often had to check whether somebody made off with it!-------------------  ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER: ** (2 of 5)  -------------------My immediate impression of the EVF was \"wow, small\". I thought that maybe I would get used to it, but then someone handed me a Nikon SLR to take their picture on a hike and I was wowed by the view through the glass. I know that's an unfair comparison, but it made me realize the EVF inadequacy without a doubt. It doesn't help that trying to use the GX7 viewfinder with glasses is almost impossible, and that the diopter is hard to adjust as well (slider instead of dial).There are a few more minor annoyances (such as insufficient eye shielding which makes is hard to use in direct sunlight, or an oversensitive proximity sensor), but the \"small and hard to adjust\" aspects are what kills it for me. That said, If you do have 20/20 unaided vision and manage to adjust the thing, you'll probably get more out of it than I do.-------------------  BASIC OPERATION: *** (3 of 5)  -------------------Many photographers (I'm one of them) just use the basic (M, A, S, P) modes, so they should just work as expected. I found some problems with this. - In M mode, the ISO doesn't adjust automatically. It's been pointed out to me that this is normal, and perhaps historically it has been, but with today's noise- free sensors, ISO is just the third exposure variable. I have a Fuji camera that cost half of this GX7, and it does have auto ISO. - Both dials do the exact same thing by default. You have to go to the menu and reassign the second dial to exposure compensation, at which point it works as expected. - I found that popping up the flash strangely overrides your exposure comp settings, AND upped the ISO for no apparent reason, often resulting in overexposed and noisy pictures. This only stopped when I set the \"flash exposure compensation\" to ON.Luckily, all the above things are software problems! It stands to hope that Panasonic fixes these in firmware.-------------------  TAKING PICTURES: *** (4 of 5)  -------------------Overall, the camera acts pretty snappy, although it's not on par with my 9- year old clunky Canon DSLR! In particular, switching from EVF to LCD, or from view to shoot, powering up/down, or waking up from sleep mode all seem to take a second, whereas the olde DSLR is always instantly ready. But once the camera is in the right mode, it's fast.The autofocus (single- shot at least) is formidable for a non- phase detect system, especially in low light. It just snaps to focus and doesn't hunt at all, which is especially great for movies! As is common these days, it has decent face- detection as well, or you can tap on the touchscreen to focus (unlike a reviewer stated, I don't think tap-to-focus works when you look through the EVF though).The menu system is workable, and the camera highly configurable. Not up to (crazy) Olympus levels where you can reassign every button, but there's plenty of customizations available, including \"virtual\" buttons on the touchscreen. On the downside, I find the display very cluttered. For example, it shows the microphone levels in picture mode (!), as well as a plethora of other useless icons (like the aspect ratio being STANDARD). Changing shutter or focus brings up colorful bands which I'm sure are somehow clever, but basically they're obstructing the picture. The histogram is draggable on the LCD screen but so coarse and nervous it ends up being inferior to my point-n-shoot's histogram. All these are software problems I know, but honestly this needs work.One last nuisance: even though the battery is rated at 1025mAh and the camera has a middle- of- the- pack CIPA rating, I find I run out of power in no time. Barely lasts me 1/2 day! I've tried setting everything to \"eco\" as well as use the EVF exclusively (which shuts off rather fast when not in use), but it didn't help much. You gonna need a spare which currently is priced rather highly, even though mine says Made In China (the camera is made in Japan).-------------------  KIT LENS: *** (3 of 5)  -------------------The kit lens is made of plastic (in China) and contrasts quite a bit with the camera body. Optically, it's actually not bad, with no sharpness or aberration issues that I've noticed.  It has an optical image stabilizer that gets me surefire shots at 1/10\", and down to 1/2\" with a little luck (in wide positions). My main quibble with the lens is that it starts at F3.5, causing the camera to increase the ISO quickly and therefore undoing some of the advantages of the state-of-the-art sensor. Given that many small compacts now have F2.0 lenses (or less!), I feel that Panasonic could perhaps have offered a better kit lens in a second bundle (much like Olympus does - you get to chose cheap or nice kit lens). Again, it's not bad for what it is, just a little mismatched perhaps.-------------------  WIFI: ***** (5 of 5)  -------------------Contrary to at another reviewer who deemed it \"terrible\", I find WiFi a great feature. The camera can either create its own network (out in the woods, say), or join an existing one. Once connected, you need an app to connect to it; on the PC side this is \"PhotoFun\" (included), and on the iOS side \"Panasonic Image App\" (free). The latter works particularly well on an iPad: there is a live view, ability to adjust parameters, shoot(!), delete, download, or upload pictures. The latest version even adds gps track logging so that your images can be automatically geotagged.-------------------  MOVIES: ***** (5 of 5)  -------------------This camera's movie mode is more than an afterthought. It can directly write MP4 files and record in 60fps, with impressive results. It's clearly not intended to be the the enthusiast's choice (evidenced by the missing external mic socket), but for casual videographers the results are quite impressive. Having that no- hunt autofocus and image stabilization (lens only, sensor stabilization is off in video mode) helps a lot.-------------------  PC SOFTWARE: ** (2 of 5)  -------------------The accompanying DVD contains two notable software packages: - The RAW editor (SilkyPix v3.1.19.2) left me rather underwhelmed. It is slow, it doesn't offer specific GX7 support such as automatic lens correction or leveling, and I'm missing functions such as quick preview, rating, or basic image editing. I know I sound spoiled, but Canon ships a RAW editor with their $300 cameras which has all those things! On a positive note, I find SilkyPix' noise reduction terrific; it seems to remove the noise without blurring the picture. - The photo/video suite (PHOTOfunSTUDIO v9.2) is basically an organizing tool with many convenience functions. For example, there's face recognition, social media upload, date imprinting/decorating, DVD burning, and a function to make a movie out of your pictures. The video piece has GPU acceleration. Overall it seems like a pretty ok app, if you don't already have a photo organizer.-------------------  THE VERDICT: **** (4 of 5)  -------------------My disappointment is with the EVF, but the overall build quality, outstanding movie mode and snappy autofocus have put this camera back into the \"I like it\" category for me, even in its kit configuration.Now, in order to get to the next level, one would have to invest in a better lens and RAW converter software, at which point we're solidly in Canon / Nikon midrange SLR territory. And as much as I like this Panasonic, I don't think it can compete with the old boys in terms of speed, quality, and bundled software just yet. So if you want maximum camera per buck, I feel that this is not it. If you're looking for a high- quality compact though, consider this GX7.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, terrible wifi", "Author": "R.

For my purposes as an amateur street photographer, this camera has everything I need and much, much more.My only complaint is the wifi, which was one of the main reasons I chose this camera. From other reviews, it sounds like many people have had the same problems I had. I got it to connect to my iphone (via the free Panasonic app) fairly easily, but have not been able to do anything further with the app (upload to facebook or even just save to my camera roll). However, what I REALLY wanted to do was easily (read: wirelessly) and quickly upload photos to my PC for editing. I got this function to work successfully just once. It took about one minute per picture to upload. Every time you want to use the camera's wifi, you have to re-enter your password, which is ridiculous. The time spent choosing what you want to connect to, waiting for the camera to find it, entering the password (with an old-school non-QWERTY keypad) for your wifi, entering the username & password for your computer or mobile device, selecting your photos, holding your breath, and then seeing that the connection failed (no reason given) would be better spent just painting a portrait of whatever you took a picture of and hanging it on your wall, because that picture will never, EVER make it to your computer.If I didn't love absolutely everything else about this camera, I would have returned it due to the wifi fail.

I decided to upgrade from the GH2 because of (1) the improved sensor, (2) the onboard stabilization and (3) focus peaking. I didnt get the kit lens and use the Panny 12-13mm 2.8, which is excellent.  All three met expectations nicely. DXO notwithstanding, I would put it 2 stops  better than the GH2. For Indoors, I default the iso to 1600 now, instead of 400 with the GH2. 3200 is quite useable for snaps. Image stabilization works pretty well, adding maybe 1.5 stops for unstabilized lenses. Focus peaking is very important for me as I shoot with old 50mm 1.4 Contax and Minolta lenses.  The M43 system is sometimes faulted for inability to get shallow depth of field in portrait lenses. If you mount a 50mm 1.4 lens and get close you can choose which hair on the eyelash to put in  focus. However, accurate focusing was a problem with the viewfinder; at 1.4 the camera tended to focus a bit behind the target. Longer focal lengths were more difficult to focus accurately. This is all much better with focus peaking.  You can pick these legacy lenses up cheaply. DXO puts the sensor a shade under the Olympus OM DE M1. I haven't compared the two cameras, but in any event, the GX7's $400 lower price point it a very serious contender. The menu system is Panasonic's strongest advantage over Olympus.  It has further improved with the addition of a moving text describing the settings.  On the GH2 you must use the manual to remember what stabilization mode 1,2,3 mean.  However, its still not optimal:iDynamic \"Contrast and exposure will be adjusted automatically\"...Thanks a lot.iResolution: \"Take pictures with improved sharpness and resolution\" ... What trade off?I cant see how any one could understand the difference between \"Ex. tele conv\" and \"digital zoom\" without recourse to the manual, and the manual doesn't explain it well either. I had to consult other sources.  Nor could one understand the \"EX\" in the quick menu for \"picture setting\" (which includes size and aspect ratio). In the menu under picture size there is no indication of its relation to Ex Tele conv. This feature is actually important for video. It would be nice to be told how graying out some choices depends on other choices, eg. how tele conv depends on picture size and quality. It would be nice to access more and better information onboard.I couldn't get the wifi to work within an hour and gave up - I dont care about this feature anyway.The processing software Silkypix is much better than most default RAW converters, and the PRO5 developer version is quite nice.

I regularly make portraits in the studio that rival my Canon 5D mmiii for sharpness and detail. The m43 world offers  large range of good lenses so I am not left wanting for choice.The silent shutter feature alone is worth buying this camera if you do any discreet photography at all.

It was down to the GX7, the Fuji X-02, or spend more for the Olympus E-M1.  I labored over the decision, and eventually decided to take the chance on this one.  I couldn't be happier.The image stabilizer is better than I expected. I can take pictures while moving and get solid results, even in indoor lighting with slower shutter speeds. The included 14-42mm lens is pretty decent.  I wouldn't call it an amazing lens, but as a kit lens, I am impressed. It has a good working range, and I have achieved some moderate bokeh with it. The adjustable screen and the adjustable viewfinder make this SO easy to use in tight spaces or for odd angles. The autofocus works well, and the adjustability of it makes it amazing.Oh, and the silent shutter is GREAT!  At a classical concert snapping some shots for the group, but without the rage of all those in the audience!  It make take some work to get a shot on fast moving targets, but I loved having it, and got all the pictures I needed without disturbing others!Taking video with this camera has also produced great results.  I haven't had any artifacts, or distortions, and been very happy with it so far.So in summary, Great camera!  It takes magnificent pictures, fast shutter, good controls.

While this is a great camera on paper, and while it does take great pictures, it has several major shortcomings, a couple of which were deal-breakers for me:1. The much vaunted EVF isn't all that great. It has a large number of pixels, but it is nearly impossible to see the entire frame if you wear glasses. Even with my contact lenses on, I still feel like I'm looking into a tunnel.2. There's no audio input. This is a shame, since the 1080P video output is gorgeous. Unfortunately, sound is an important part of any video production and the built-in microphones don't cut it.3. The built-in image stabilization feature doesn't operate in video mode. This is just silly.4. The WiFi implementation is wonky at best. The iPad app is easy enough to connect, but i never could get the remote trigger to work. On the plus side, I was able to get the camera to deliver pictures to my Mac, which is very useful when you have lots of photos to process all at once.5. (this is the big one for me): With the camera mounted on a tripod plate (I use a Manfrotto 410 gear head for tabletop product photography), you can't use the flip screen, you can't open the connector door, and you can't get to the battery/SD card door without taking the tripod plate off the camera.I wound up sending it back and ordering an EM-1 instead.

Much of my prior work which involved tedious routines almost become automatic with this machine. The thing that swayed me over others like the  Sony and Samsung, Canon and Nikon units with interchangeable lenses was the viewfinder which those other choices lacked. The camera will require a lot of work on my part to get back to my prior level of expertise but that is due to the amazing electronic capabilities built into the camera; it takes some practice to become automatic.

GX7 is standing on the limit in between compact and entry size dslr. pana gh3 and gh2, oly omd series have become the size of entry level DSLR which i can not see any reason why a man will buy these cam when there is already a body with same size and with bigger sensor.if you want hardcore results, you must  go for constant aperture lenses, primes or zooms, you can take well quality photos.for primes, leica 25mm. zuiko 45mm and 75mm will rock this body. if you do not mind the budget, you can go for voigtlander manual primes with 0.95 apertures. i never used voigtlander lens on my mft bodies, but i checked some sites and seen amazingly quality photos taken with mft body- voigtlander combos.there is 550$ difference in between GX7 and omd-em1 .. gear lovers making masturbation on web with showing their 1/100 crop images taken by omd-em1 and saying '' look dude, how sharp it is in lowlight'' and making comparisions by their own way.. this is totally madness.. all digital camera preview sites have become absurdly overrated.i respect omd-em1 because of its unique AF system and high dynamic range.

XE1 did not have tilt screen and also poor video performance.  So far I love GX7's low light performance even with kit zoom lens.

Main reasons for buying GX7 are: Tilt screen, metal body, good looks, ergonomics, touch focus / shoot screen, tone adjustment, in camera HDR and panoramic, Lots of quick access customizable Fn buttons, larger than 1/1.7 CMOS sensor though APS would have been better, Electronic view finder is located far left corner so nose does not smudge the 3\" screen or accidentally trigger shot, auto switch between EVF versus 3\" screen, 1080p/60fps video, easy access to exposure compensation, ...

First disappointment was the huge gaps (2mm) between the plastic chrome trim under the \"GX7\" tag.

Deficient documentation/manuals.", "Author": "Much Obliged", "ReviewID": "R115EQVULBIQM6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In addition to the GX7, I have used a GF2, G5, and FZ200.My advice to those of you considering this camera is to think again.  I do not think that the incremental improvements are worth the hassle and frustration of setup and use of some of the most highly touted new features.Yes, the imaging technology is marginally improved since the G6 and G5.  Better shutter speed range, better electronic shutter capabilities, better ISO range, improved noise, better touch screen... all incremental improvements.  By God it takes great pictures.  However, the device is confusing and frustrating when it comes to set-up and use of some of the most highly touted newer capabilities.  Namely, the WIFI capabilities.  It's not that they clearly don't work... it's that you cannot tell if they don't work because of a camera or network problem, or if the documentation has simply taken you down the wrong path... until you actually get it working (or not).  When it comes to explaining things like the type of connection that is actually being established, the entity to which the documentation is specifically referring (camera, tablet, cloud), the various steps involved in setup... it's just a confusing morass.Here for example is what one is faced with when setting up the \"cloud folder\" settings.  This is on the web site when configuring the cloud storage service provided by Panasonic.  It says:  \"Select a type from the dropdown menu, check the displayed item, and press the Add button to set as your automatic sending address from the initialization folder.\"  The choices it gives are \"Device links\" and \"Web service\". There is no explanation or help (that I could find) regarding what this actually means.  The manual (even the advanced 14-meg PDF) glosses over many steps at points where clear, unambiguous details/directions are needed.  The entire setup experience is like this.  It's as if the camera was never shown to end-users before the engineers cobbled together their crap UI and/or the documentation was written long before implementation.  I suppose this could be a lesson in empathy... as I am a software developer.  An ultra-nerd.  But if I can't figure out what they are saying (with 3 routers/bridges running custom firmware in my home, and a Linux-based NAS, etc)... God help the non-techie / serious photographers who have to wrestle with this thing.In terms of ease of use, apparently the wifi firmware was written in modules by engineers who did not communicate... as every time (within a different option of setup) when you select the _same_ access point (SSID), it makes you re-enter the _same_ encryption key... even though you just did it 3 screens ago within another aspect of set up.  For your cloud log-in ID, it assigns an immutable 12 digit number.  You cannot make up your own username.  There is no direct access from the camera to Dropbox or other cloud services ... except of course Panasonic's cloud.  The camera' wifi range is less than that of my HTC smartphone  and Google tablet... so proximity to an access point becomes an issue.  It's one cumbersome thing after another.  I will concede that the phone/tablet Panasonic Image App seems to work as advertised and once you figure out its setup camera side (it's not hard, just confusing), it works and is pretty slick.  Again, sadly, you cannot configure the camera's access point encryption key... you are stuck with entering an immutable cumbersome hex string courtesy of Panasonic.  I could not get NFC transfer to work with my Nexus 7 but it did work with my HTC phone.This is my final $0.02.  Having now used the GF2, G5, FZ200, and GX7... my advice is that by far the biggest bang for the buck... the most versatile solution for truly almost everything you'll encounter... is the FZ200.  It has a fast and extremely versatile all-in-one lens.  It has an EVF and supports TTL external flash.  It supports RAW format.  Unlike even the GX7, it supports an external microphone.  It has some very nice slow-mo and super-slow mo video recording capabilities.  Yes, at the very high end, images are bit noisier... not quite the image quality... 12 MP rather than 16 at full res... not quite as fast to focus (but the FZ200 covers a huge zoom range)... but in reality it will be a very rare situation where you would have needed a GX7 to get pictures that are noticeably better than the FZ200.  For $400 today you can get the FZ200 (camera/lens as one unit) that can do everything from macro to super-tele for less than half the price of the GX7 body alone.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but...", "Author": "ANDRZEJ BACINSKI", "ReviewID": "R29VTM7S3KN02J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good camera.

With 8 times the sensor size I knew it would be a huge step up in IQ.I set the GX7 and the FZ150 on tripods and shot a few indoor pictures, played with aperture and WB on both cameras.Well it takes nice pictures, slightly better detail than the FZ, but I have to look awful close to tell the difference.I shoot small mechanical items and structural details on machinery. So I am more aware of sharpness and the ability to see small detail rather than colorful landscapes or people.Way better construction than the FZ, but it's twice the price.The viewfinder is super high resolution, but it seems a little soft, adjusting the diopter doesn't solve the problem. Adjusting the diopter is VERY difficult as it slides rather than rotates, making fine adjustments hard to accomplish.Another issue is the rear LCD keeps shutting off when the camera is on a tripod, it thinks I'm using the viewfinder, even with sensitivity set to low. Never had this problem with my GH2.The tilt only rear LCD is hobbled compared to the flip, rotate one on the FZ, plus you can't face it in to protect it.The door for the connectors is a pain to open, you must first tilt out the rear LCD to be able to open it.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "evf no good w polarized sunglasses", "Author": "Leonard Friedland \"lenny\"", "ReviewID": "R2RAIY5TA3P101", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Usually while wearing polarized sunglasses, an EVF is usable in landscape mode and unusable in portrait mode. This is reversed in the GX7, where the view is distorted in landscape mode but clear in portrait (again, while wearing polarized sunglasses.)I've owned a few different cameras with an evf, such as lumiz gh2 and oly ep2 and have always been able to use the viewfinder in landscape mode while wearing polarized sunglasses. I have not tried other more recent EVF's, such as the om-d series, so I don't know if the problem is endemic to the latest generation of evf's.a few further points -- the sensor is noticeably improved over GH2, especially at higher iso's -- nicer images at ever iso- battery/card compartment is inconveniently located - I'm concerned I may break it laying the camera down with it open- wheel functions are slow -- turning the program shift wheel shows a noticeable lag between clicks and setting changes, unlike the GH2 which tracks the wheel wellFor some, perhaps myself, the EVF is a disqualifier.

Hessler", "ReviewID": "R15DVVFDLBO73U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am looking for the ideal camera that does not exist yet.  It would produce great pictures from a truly pocketable unit so one always has the camera with you.  It would look something like my Sony RX100, have a 1\" senser, but it would also be a little larger with grip, zoom out to at least 10x and most of all it would have a viewfinder.  Taking pictures in sunlight is a pure guess with the RX100 or any w/o a viewfinder.  I received the GX7 body only and it does take great pictures even using my Olympus 14-150 mm and 35 mm pancake lens.  The viewfinder with magnified center is superb. I was trying to update my early PEN unit because mu Sony A55 with 18-300MM lenses is too big and heavy. Here is what was wrong with the GX7: It is impossible to handle the GX7 camera without your thumb engaging the display button and others, and you never know what screen you will see.  The firmware is not user friendly.  I tried in vain to change an aperture setting in A mode and never succeeded.  I tried changing the focus point location and finally found it can be done with the touch screen, sort of.  After moving it I tried hitting enter or OK but was unsuccessful in leaving this mode even turning the camera on and off.  I gave up and returned the unit - thank you Amazon.  Most of all though these 4/3 cameras are as large and bulky as a entry level DSLR - see the Canon SL-1 with larger senser and most scenes right on the mode dial.  I am going to buy a Canon G-16 which fits a belt pouch but I know it is not the solution with a 5x zoom and small senser 1/1.7.  Well, the camera makers like my search  - does anyone know how to get some value out of unused cameras.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly touted device seriously lacking.", "Author": "Cisco H.
