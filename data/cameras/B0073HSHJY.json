S9300 will not lock focus when zoomed at or near it's maximum.2. Selecting one of the Auto ISO ranges...125-800 ISO causes the camera to select very low shutter speeds, so that even with vibration reduction, if you are shooting people, the imgages are soft...appearing OOF...out of focus. (Unacceptable for this price range.)3. The facial recognition feature, if used on anything but faces...will most often select something other than what you want to focus on...and since this is a menu driven feature, if you're switching between sceens, like at a birthday party, it's a pain to use.4. Generally speaking, the images leave a lot to be desired across the board.  And, this is the general consensus of online reviews...rating the camera a \"C\" as very average.  I have to agree.5. Portrait mode is way too cool...and there is no way to adjust the color temp in any mode except Auto.  Or from the menu when in Auto...again, for the price, this is unacceptable.6. And this is a biggie...I have lost confidence in the camera's ability to capture the shots that I want.I tried to like it...I shot over 200 images...and very few were keepers.  I had a Canon Elf S600...and it took better images than this model...and the Canon S600 is 4 years old.I have called Nikon and asked for an RMA and am returning S9300 for a refund. Bottom line, for $349.00, this camera is a poor to average performer...yeilding good to mediocre images.I don't disagree that if you are outside in bright light that it takes pretty good images...but, still not up to my expectations for the price tag.I cannot in good conscience recommend this camera to friends or anyone else.Like I said in my opening statement...I may have a bad copy.  These are just my findings on the copy that I received...Not a happy camper here...UPDATE: Going on vacation soon and wanted a better point and shoot.  Purchased the Nikon P7700 compact point and shoot.  I am thrilled to say that this is more like what I was looking for when I bought the S9300.  There are lots of external controls...more is better...such as a thumb wheel to adjust your exposure on the fly...way cool.Image quality is first rate at this price point($399.00.)  It is bigger than the S9300 and doesn't have the zoom range...but it does zoom optically to the equivalent of 200mm.  Nice.Just check out the P7700 here at Amazon...you won't be sorry.I see Nikon has yanked the S9300 and replaced it with an S9500...so, reviews weren't wrong...to bad for current S9300 owners.  I wonder if Nikon will be offering a discount on the new S9500, if you send in your S9300.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera, could use some updates.", "Author": "Rcubed", "ReviewID": "R3HAMMYZPAB33L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera since i lost my canon powershot sd900.

When you do take a photo it takes forever for the preview to disappear. You can either have it on or off.  With canon it gave you the option of 1,2 or 3 second preview.

My last compact being an olympus, which was a very disappointing experience. All the nikons I have owned in the past have always had a good build quality so that's what swung it for this one. When I purchased this camera it was brand new to the market so there was limited reviews but mostly positive. The Lumix zs20 nearly got my money as it is also a fantastic compact with similar spec but i'm a sucker for the nikon brand so I took the plunge. First impressions were that it is smaller then I expected, which is a good thing to me as that is the point of a compact right. The build quality seems good as do the ergonomics. Have taken a few hundred shots with it and am very impressed. Low light shots are particularly good with very low noise. The 18 x zoom is silent, quick and very smooth with decent optics, my only complaint being that at the maximum reaches and the camera being so small it is hard to hold steady enough for a sharp image but that is probably the issue on any small camera with a long lens.

The design of the camera is terrible and the flash is located in a terrible place that is very inconvenient.  The biggest problem that I have though is the fact that this camera takes mostly blurry pictures.  I would think the idea of a point and shoot is that you can grab it out of your bag and just take a picture.  I recently took a trip to colorado and took a bunch of pictures only to find that most of them had awful color balance and were extremely blurry.

I've been a photographer for over 40 years and its a good quality device.There have been no failures and I've had relatively little trouble learning to use it on the fly.  (Although I admit I used the instruction manual once!) I've used the camera in below zero conditions in the snow, backpacking, in low light, in the rain as well as in bright sunlight.  It performs excellently in all conditions, giving good crisp and clear photos.  Of course, this means that you've actually taken the time to compose the shot ahead of time. No camera will compensate for poor set up.  It has never froze, or given me an error message.As with any new camera there are some things you have to learn to do differently.  I've adjusted to the fact that the flash pops up under where I usually put my left index finger and never think about it.I'd recommend the camera as a good all around camera.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon customer service is terrible", "Author": "Christopher H.

The person you can talk to knows very little and will not forward you to someone with more authority to help.  The company seems to care very little about customer satisfaction, and I am worried about the overall quality of this camera based on the early failure of the lens system.

And since the s9200 was 50% off this Thanksgiving, I bought it.I really like this camera for a few reasons. It worked well straight out of the box, and better once I read the manual(read your manuals people). I like that it does fit in my pockets(the shorter girl pants pockets, not the deep manly pants pockets. Tho it would fit those also). It will take a burst of shots, which is great when chasing a toddler and trying to get one really good facial expression. I love the 18x optical zoom. I looove a good optical zoom. It also does very well tracking faces, up to nine(so says manual, personally I've seen it focus on 3 faces in the same shot, and they were all in focus at different distances from the camera). I like that I can turn off the option to preview my photos as they are taken(the 2 sec screen freeze before being able to take another picture).I have used this camera indoors and out, both with plenty of shots I liked. My approach to amateur photography is to take a ton of photos, then go through and pull out the few that were great. 16 megapixels also gives room to go through and crop your pictures later without losing some quality, although I try to frame my shots as I take them.The flash is in an awkward place, where you want to put your left index finger, which takes some getting used to, but is not worth avoiding the camera.I would recommend this to everyone I know. I have not found any major negatives.Please note that the battery charger for this camera plugs into the camera with the battery inside.

Then this spring it stopped working again so I returned to the same shop and this time he says it can't be fixed. He does not sell cameras so his word is believable I think.

However, Amazon did gave me enough information to decide which digital camera I will buy to add to my photography pieces. I owned Canon DSLRs and I don't like Nikon DSLRs but I am surprised by this camera handled the way I want it to be, point and shoot, portable and it gives me freedom to adjust my photos just \"like\" my DSLR. I took several photos in every angles in comparison to DSLRs and there are few things that it doesn't have that edge in comparison to DSLR but it has the ability to mimic the DSLR. I like the Nikon Coolpix S9300 because the controls are \"easy\" to navigate unlike those expensive digital P&S; camera that you only paying for its name but the quality isn't.Second, if you decide to buy a digital camera, take this instead. A little heavy, sturdy [unlike those ones that are made of light plastics], you need a tripod if you use to zoom in small or distant subjects so there will be no shaking, battery is acceptable, lots of features that you will like. Geo-tagging or GPS is nice but I'm not a concern about it because what I'm concerned are the photos I take.Lastly, if you compare digital cameras from one to another be sure to compare resolution, sturdiness and quality of the camera because most of us like to keep it longer and serves us best.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worst Auto Focus EVER !", "Author": "J.

Lindner", "ReviewID": "R2LZJWZ6RHSMRL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love Nikon cameras.  I am very pleased with my D3100 and the several lenses I bought for it.  So when I decided I also wanted a point and shoot, I was not surprised when my list of desired features for my camera led me to select the Nikon S9300.  I was confident my purchase would justify my evaluation of the several cameras available.  But I am somewhat disappointed with this camera.  At face value it seems to match up to the competition, but there is something missing with the camera as a whole.  Let me explain what I mean.The autofocus seems to work well, but once I download my pictures, they are not always clear.  They appear clear in the view window when I take the picture, but the end result is not always what I expected.  Likewise, the selector dial on the camera is easily rotated, even when I do not want to change the setting.  It is as if the dial gets bumped or adjusted when I return my camera to my pocket or to its case.  The flash settings also seem to get changed without my knowing.  I set the flash to automatic, take some shots then return the camera to the case.  When I ready for my next shot, the flash is on a setting other than automatic.  These issues are annoying (though by themselves are not necessarily a dealbreaker).  I realize I likely am part of the reason for my problems, but my old Olympus point and shoot never gave me these problems.  Perhaps Nikon's desire to have multiple features is also part of the problem.  In their attempt to make this camera user friendly, they overlooked the fact that not every user will be proficient in all aspects of its use.On the positive side, the pictures that are in focus are great.  Many of my pictures are of a work related nature (building mechanical equipment, roofs, driveways, etc.) so I'm not talking about missing out on the perfect \"Kodak moment,\" but I do rely on my camera to capture a picture so I do not have to write the thousand words I'd otherwise need to write.  The zoom lens is very powerful, though maximum zoom requires either a tripod or a very stable hand, and the pixel settings allow for well defined detail shots.  The GPS helps remind me where I was when I took the picture.I do not regret buying this camera.  Afterall, it was the only camera that had all of the features I was looking for in a point and shoot.  I just think that Nikon could have done a better job in constructing the camera so to avoid these bothersome issues.  It is a comfortable camera to bring along on any type of outing.  For these reasons I say this is a good camera, just not a great camera.  My old Olympus lasted me eleven years before a mysterious hole developed in my viewfinder and I could no longer load the software on new computers.

If you remove the battery, the settings -- at least whether to include GPS location information -- gets reset back to the factory default.  I missed the GPS information on a number of shots due to this \"feature.\"2.  My camera doesn't charge very well through the USB -- meaning that I have to remove the battery and put it in the external charger.

The two best things I liked about this camera are whopping 18X optical zoom and the 1080p HD movies it shoots.Being a hobbyist photographer, I myself own a Nikon D7000 with a couple of lenses which I use every time I try my hands on photography. Wanted to buy an easy to use point-and-shoot for a friend. Being a Nikon fan for life, my work on selecting the manufacturer was cut short. Now, all I had to choose was a model with decent resolution (above 8MP), good optical zoom and the capacity to use Li-Ion battery (I hate the cameras which use AA batteries!!!). This helped me zero down on a few available Nikon cameras.Finally I decided to but the S9200 and it was available at a good discount (49% when I bought it and its 59% now !!!!). Before handing it over to a friend, I tried my hands on it to make sure I got the right product. This camera didn't disappoint me at all. With its CMOS sensor, the clarity of the pictures is unmatched and 16MP gives you pictures which will not pixelate even if you zoom in to its limits. As  I said my favorite feature on the camera in its 18X optical zoom, meaning you can take macro shots of flowers (my favorite subjects while shooting with DSLR) with ease. This also comes in handy when you want to take shots of animals/birds/butterflies from a distant so that you don't disturb/scare them. 1080p HD movie is ideal to shoot any live scene (although that's not my favorite thing), but can be used with ease during any function and party. You see the effect of 1080p when you watch it on a PC or TV monitor. Although not very important, the high resolution screen shows you the images at awesome clarity.Two additional features I liked were the in-camera editing and panorama. With the in camera edit, you can add various effects to your photos and make them more appealing even before you copy them to your computer. I did use \"Easy Panorama Mode\" to make a panorama and was surprised to see the camera itself stitched all the images and I didn't need any post processing using third-party software !! This is something which many people would love to experiment with. A few other features worth mentioning are the Nikon's innovative VR image stabilization, 7 fps continuous shooting and considerably long battery life.A few people have listed endless number of issues with this camera. My point is that if you have all these problems, why not buy a DSLR instead of point and shoot. At this price, one cannot ask for features which are available in a DSLR camera. Another user complains that it is difficult to hold the camera still when you are zoomed out at 18x. Isn't that a practical problem???? You will have this with any point-and-shoot, because of its small size. I would suggest to use a tripod in such cases, instead of blaming camera which offers something which human beings can handle !!! A few other complaints by various users just make me laugh. It seems that they have mentioned those issues just for the sake of mentioning!! I feel that this camera provides you more than enough features for a starter or casual shooter at a reasonable price.

If you're shooting in daylight and the subject doesn't move, the camera is perfect. If you're shooting indoors and/or your subjects move and you don't want one blurred photo after another, get a different camera. I have tried changing every setting I could change and nothing gave me clean action shots.If that wasn't bad enough, the lag between shots is positively maddening. I count 5 seconds.

I was looking for a higher resolution, non-DSLR type camera for general use, and I didn't want anything overly complicated to deal with.  Overall, the camera does a decent job.  The camera is easiest to work with in auto mode, though it has some manual capability as well.  Color saturation was excellent and natural looking.  Some of the reviews said there were issues with focus.  In auto mode I did notice that some shots did not come out as sharply as I would have preferred and sometimes the camera had some difficulty maintaining focus even with a well-lighted subject.  For such a high resolution camera (16 mega pixels) I would have expected a better overall image than this camera seems to produce. In fact, my very ancient Sony Mavica MVC-CD500, purchased back in 2002, and which is only 5 mega pixels, can produce jaw-dropping images with razor-sharp accuracy. The s9200 also shoots 1080 video which is not bad at all.  The s9200 is relatively small and can accept SDHC cards for lots of images.  The preview screen on the rear is very large and bright.  Menu structure and navigation is typical but easy to use and understand.  While the camera has lots of features, there's not so much to this camera to get confused with. One issue with setting time on this camera is that it only uses military 24-hour format, there's no option for a more typical AM through PM format. The camera has a very solid feel to it and is solidly built.  The one really bad thing I noticed about its case design is the positioning of the automatic pop-up flash unit.  Unless you leave the flash unit in its up position, because of its location on the top left corner area of the camera - right where you're likely grab the camera with your left hand - if the camera decides it needs the flash, your hand will most likely prevent it from \"popping up\".  My advice is to leave the flash in its up position so your hand will accommodate holding the camera without the danger of preventing the flash from popping when needed - but then you need to watch that you don't put a finger in front of the flash. Zooming worked as expected but I did notice the camera had some difficulty with focusing so be sure you're not too close AND at the same time zoomed in or the camera will not properly focus. The camera's macro mode seemed to work, though it didn't seem to provide the ability to focus any better and seemed to have issues with focus. This camera does not use expendable replacement batteries but a proprietary rechargeable battery. The camera also comes with the usual software to download images from the camera to your PC and also has a panoramic stitching program.  I tried the stitching program and it takes a bit of using but it does work. There is a higher capability stitching program available for additional cost and if you will be doing panoramas you may want to upgrade to it.  For the price I paid ($ 150) this is a very usable camera.  However, if you're looking for better performance and better focus and sharpness, look to a different model or maker.UPDATE 10-2013: My original comments still apply and having had the Nikon S9200 for a couple of months now and having used it on two trips I cannot recommend it over a different make or model in spite of its good qualities:  Battery life is excellent; A single charge seems to last forever. Although the camera has some manual capabilities, I did not use them and have used it exclusively in AUTO mode.  However, even in AUTO mode, focus is a) unreliable at best and b) impossible to achieve when fully zoomed in on a subject even at a considerable distance from the subject. Macro mode does not seem to make any difference with focus and focus was inconsistent. I'm sorry to say that, after significant use, focus is simply unreliable.  Although the camera can take excellent shots much of the time, with very natural color saturation, the focus issue overrides all others (at least for me) and so you cannot depend on getting a clean and in-focus shot. I've also discovered significant parallax error with most shots requiring a visit to Photoshop to make corrections (may be the lens system or glass/sensor combination). So unless you know how to correct images with severe parallax error, have software that allows you to make such corrections, and you don't care about the time it takes, be prepared to edit many, if not all, your images. An additional annoyance I've discovered is the small flap on the right-side (when looking at the back of the camera) that hides the USB and HDMI output: You'll need to access the USB to charge the camera or use its HDMI output. When the flap is in place it is extremely difficult to open; there seems to be no tactile edge to grip so that one can easily open it. In fact this was so annoying to me (and I have the patience of a saint) that I actually ripped off and permanently removed the flap! The current price on Amazon is more than what I originally paid and while you can still get it from a 3rd party via Amazon (or elsewhere) for less than what Amazon is charging I would strongly advise to STAY AWAY from this particular Nikon model and get something else that does not have the severe focus issue this model seems to have.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix S9200", "Author": "EF", "ReviewID": "R2FCIB5AJT3MPA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has a great size and capabilities for travel.It is virtually worthless because the battery and card storage door will NOT LATCH in a satisfactory manner.

That's all well and good and their opinions were valuable, but let's be honest, I'm a mom of three under the age of five who rarely ventures out of \"Auto\" mode when it comes to photography. I don't know camera technicalities and I don't have time to learn them right now (though I look forward to the day when I can). I just need a camera that will photograph my kids and, yet, still give me quality images.I found what I was looking for with this camera. The images are sharp and, while it sometimes takes a little longer than I'd like to focus, it still works quicker than my previous point-and-shoot (which often took a full 5-10 seconds to focus and still came out blurry - that doesn't hack it with active kids). Best of all, I used this baby yesterday while attending the birth of a friend, which means, of course, the hospital lighting was less-than-ideal (aka VERY dim) and the photos came out beautifully! There was no grainy texture, no washed out faces. And the zoom worked well enough that I was able to grab close shots of baby without having to stick the camera (and its flash) right in his face.Thus, from a complete amateur's point-of-view, this camera is worth its salt. The panoramic, which I've tried a few times, works great and looks stunning. Macro shots of birthday flowers look professional.My only complaint is how long it takes to view photos. Another reviewer mentioned having to have the camera on to review photos in playback, and this is true (and slightly annoying but not too bad), but what frustrates me is that it takes a full ten-seconds between pushing the play-back button and the images coming up - and if you don't think that sounds like too long, count it out, it's longer than you think and frustrating when you want to check quickly if you got the shot).

They claim that you are able to take perfect pictures with practically no light. The camera didn't last long enough for me to figure out if it was something I was doing or if the camera was junk. A couple of weeks ago I started having issues with the camera not focusing on what I was trying to take a picture of and it was getting hot after only having it on for a few minutes. The camera froze up and the screen displayed a lens error message and shut off a few days ago. I have tried taking the battery out and leaving it out with no luck. I called Nikon and was instructed that I would have to pay shipping and send it either UPS or FedEx to LA (I live in Kansas) to have it looked at. IF they determined that it was not because of something I did then they would fix it. After reading numerous reviews on Amazon and other websites from customers who have had the same problem and have shipped their cameras and are still waiting to get them back months later, I do not hold out much hope that the problem will be resolved.I would recommend that you save your money and purchase a camera from a company with a better reputation. The camera is only so-so. Outside it takes pretty good pictures, if it actually works that is. Inside it doesn't do so well. I can't really comment much on the camera because it started failing before I really had a chance to give it a good road test. I don't know for sure if I just got a bad camera or if it's the camera in general. I've read reviews where people were pretty pleased which is why I bought mine to begin with. Unfortunately I wasn't so lucky. Nikon's customer service is extremely poor, the customer is required to pay shipping to send the item in for repair when it is under warranty and from what some other customers have said, they have been waiting months to get their cameras back and are still waiting. I'm currently researching other cameras and will be purchasing either a Canon or a Sony this weekend.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "nikon s9200", "Author": "JClo", "ReviewID": "R2ITSS1UVI0RIE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this compact and powerful camera, many great features, but the pop-up flash can get in the way when you are holding it", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "An OK camera", "Author": "RH", "ReviewID": "R3RFEUOHEDG340", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera quickly without checking into options and I now wish I would have waited.

Everyone turns to look at me when I am trying to get pictures of my kid's concerts at school.  Also, when it is dark, a red light shines.  Another distraction that I cannot seem to turn off.  The on/off button is very small and recessed, therefore, it is difficult to operate.  I use my fingernail and can imagine it would be very frustrating for men with larger fingers.

Other than the different placement of the shutter button, I feel like I'm using the same camera, which is nice.

I did bring the charger, but that is merely an external transformer. My wife's Panasonic Lumix on the other hand has a charger that charges the battery outside the camera and more to the point, we never needed her second battery even though we used her camera as much if not more than the Nikon for over a week. As to the 18x zoom, it seems most of it is digital - which means that without a tripod - not something you normally bring on vacation, most zoomed shots are virtually impossible to get.

Over all, for me this has been a great camera and I have gone to parties etc. and put it up against Canons etc. and have gotten \" wish I had bought that model instead\" responses. The 1080 hd is fantastic but you need a good computer with dual core or duo processor to watch it and good video card. The pictures are decent quality not SLR but hey it's a compact. It does have some great features such as low light shooting adjustment and image stabilization that make it a good choice for non professionals like myself, also editing features. Now, if you want a camera that you can really adjust manually then this is not it. The 9300 has tons of effects and features but...it's all automatic. If you really want to experiment with creative photography , get incredible looking photos through an expensive lens go ahead and get a Nikon SLR entry for around 500 to 800 dollars. It is amazing what the 9300 can do but you really can't experiment like you want to. I use some of the features in ways that they are not intended to produce some of my effects but with an SLR and a good knowledge of photography it's so much Easier. The best feature I like is the panoramic stitching.  With the software from Nikon you can shoot three full pictures one after the other using a helper on the camera that shows a quarter of the previous picture when ready to shoot the next photo (landscape or portrait style) No tripod needed or guessing. Run the pics thru the software and push a button out comes a full 25 to 30 mega pixel panoramic and even I can't detect the stitch lines. I've made photos my friends think I spent hours on in adobe photo shop. Another great one is image stabilization. I took a photo of the moon at dusk at 18 x and after about 4  shots I got a complete clear image. I can see craters etc. on the moon clearly. That's un heard of without a tripod or was a few years ago. Just slightly press the shutter button and the picture will focus and hold still for a few seconds. Of course I had to really brace myself but without a tripod!? I have blog that I post my shots on [...] if you want to check them out. These are reduced size but give a good idea of the quality of the camera. You could Get the 9200 model for less. Doesn't come with GPS and compass stuff which I don't care for.

A Kodak digital camera I bought about seven years ago had that feature, so it's not something new.

I hate it so much that I hope my review will prevent others from wasting their money.Have had many different point and shoots that have all had something that was annoying but I learned to cope with.

It is so slow I was barely able to record my recent trip Egypt, a place I have wanted to go all my life.This is the main reason I purchased the camera.  I missed so many shots because the coolpix s9300 took forever to turn on, it took forever to take the shot after I pushed the button, it took forever to record the shot even after I turned off the preview feature. I got more photos of the ground because I would give up and decide the stupid camera must be broken or out of battery, which by the way it was at times. ( I faithfully recharged the battery every evening).  The panoramic feature would not record at all if the lighting changed during its use. My finger was always in the way of the flash, which is actually a feature I could learn to live with if the rest of the camera would actually shoot after point. Every single feature on the camera was a challange in some way. I met 2 other people on my trip tours that had purchased the same camera and they couldn't wait to return the cameras as soon as they got back from the trip. They and myself thought it was all user error until  we started comparing cameras and came to the conclusion that it was definitely the camera.  Every single time I asked someone to take my photo with my s9300 they commented that something must be wrong with my camera. My professional photographer friend wanted to take my photo with my camera thinking that I had no idea how to use the camera.

(when flash is on, there's no motion blur even if you swing it around quite a bit)2) The max stats for photos, it says 9999 which is fine. But the max space for video says 29 minutes, which kind of confused me at first, since I have a 64 GB super fast SD card. But it DOES record well over 29 minutes.3) The charger isn't a charger. It's a USB to Wall Plug adapter so I cannot take out the battery to charge it, I can only charge while it's in the camera.4) When you zoom to the max, automatic zoom doesn't seem to be working too well - but once you set the zoom back a little it's more able to focus.All that aside, this is the best camera I've owned so far, in both ease of use, and versatility, and the quality of both photo and video is fantastic!

Seems to bounce in and out of focus on start up especially, but even after being on for awhile it doesn't always focus.  I have lost soooo many good shots from this.  It's really annoying to the point of angering me at times.  We are talking family moments you will never catch again, that were lost because of the bad quality of this product.  I have literally gone back to using my Canon powershot 900 from 2006 because it is much more reliable.  I always bought Canon in the past, but decided to try Nikon for my latest camera.  BIG Mistake.  Canon AF is far superior to Nikon in my opinion.When using Video mode zoomed in to any distance at all the auto focus bounces and cannot acquire a good focus.When using camera in low light condition where the red light focus assist beam is used the camera literally can't focus.  It try's over and over until the shot is gone.  By contrast the 2006 Canon 900 focuses in less than a second.  Almost instantaneous, which shows me its not a technical challenge today for camera to achieve this if canon was doing it 7 years ago.  What is your excuse Nikon?  This is pathetic.Camera Body Design:Mode Select knob is a joke, one has to continually check it due to the fact that a stiff breeze may flip the setting.  I am now in the habit of checking the nob setting obsessive compulsively while taking pictures.Video record location on the back of the camera is annoying.  Its kind of awkward when one handing the camera to get your thumb up there to start video.  I think it should be next to picture button up top or some where more accessible to finger tip, not thumb.Panoramic  mode, although can produce some cool results, is very temperamental, and keeps canceling the shot if you do not move very precisely.For the price this camera is really not worth it, even if it was cheaper you may lose many important shots.

It has 16 mp, max 3200 ISO, face recognition, GPS tagging of photos, fast continuous shoot mode, HD video, and many other features. My favorite is the wonderfully easy to use panorama mode.

I like the very compact size (it fits in my Osprey carrying case), the intuitiveness of the menu system, the selector dial (L5 did not have this, but my Nikon P100 does), and of course, the panorama capability, GPS function, and the increased pixels.  I was a bit leery of some of the reviews complaining about focusing issues when using zoom.  I tested it in the store and found no problems.  I usually don't take it past optical zoom (which is clearly marked).  I tested it on a hike and the pictures came out great at full optical zoom with vibration reduction turned on.  The zoom photos from my old L5 (which I loved), would often have a scattering of blank pixels when I went to edit in iPhoto -- visible when digitally zooming in iPhoto.  The 9300 did not have this.  I played with the zoom in autofocus at close range -- about 25 feet -- and found that I could run through the focusing spectrum and the camera automatically focused correctly when I took the picture.  I just cannot duplicate the complaint.  My landscapes turned out great.I tried night photos -- I use a tripod, the timer, and turn vibration control off -- great results!  I have also taken photos of the bright full moon (same method, scenery>landscape, and exposure set to -2.0) and the photos turn out sharp.  I have enlarged and printed some of my L5 photos up to 18X24 with terrific results.  Since the S9300 photos are of much higher quality, I assume they will be even better.GPS -- Love it.  In iPhoto it displays a map and puts a red dot where the picture was taken.  No problem syncing with the GPS satellites at all.Panorama is too smooth! Select 180 or 360 degrees.  Depress the button and release and then pan steadily to the right.  The camera stops when you have completed the arc.  You can then review the photo.  Wow!On winter hikes I wear light gloves.  I can still operate the 9300 controls without any problem.I practiced facial recognition with faces in the viewfinder and it worked fine (as it did on the L5).

At first I was hesitant to get such a small point and shoot camera to replace my bigger feature packed point and shoot.  When I looked at it at the store though the camera was great and had a lot of features.  I purchased it that day and have yet to regret it.People who complain about soft or fuzzy pictures, try adjusting the settings.  I have found that some pictures turn out soft or fuzzy but if you find the right settings or presets that fixes everything.One of my favorite features is the panorama.  You just hold down the shutter button and you can take either a full 360 or a 180 panorama.  I have used this to take pictures of my apartment to send to family and even to take pictures at a work retreat to get the whole crew in.The wide angle lens is quite great.  To take our team photo at the end of our work retreat we had both my camera and the work camera up on a ledge and set on a timer.  The work camera was only able to catch half the group and took some finagling to even get to take the picture.  Instead with my S9300 hit the timer button select ten seconds, set it down, it got everyone in the picture with hardly any set up.  Didn't even turn in to one of those family photos where one person is running to their spot.  I had plenty of time to get to my spot.  The one feature that would have been nice in this case is to have a remote.The selective color feature is also quite nice.  You just select said feature on the effects menu and scroll through a list of colors to select a specific color and everything but that color is turned into black and white.  No need to go and Photoshop the picture anymore!I only paid 199 for this camera (plus tax and the SquareTrade Warranty) so it is well worth the investment.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Christmas present", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Q28YGQY58YST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter loves it .

Other times it decides it doesn't want to take anymore pictures and completely shuts down. When it works, yay! When it doesn't, well you know.

It's 16 megapixels, higher then all others in this class that I've seen and the 18x zoom is unmatched also. I bought a wide angle lens where a metal ring is adhered to the outer rim of the zoom lens then the wide angle lens is attached magnetically to get an even more panoramic shot. If you can't take excellent pics with this camera you're not trying hard enough! I also use a tripod, I got a portable type with a sling I rigged up to carry with me and a tabletop style and also one with wrap around, bendable legs to attach it to poles and rails ect. making it all the more versatile. The quality of the pics is so high that minimal post production work needs to be done in Photoshop but they can be enhanced also but really for most folks Photoshop would not even be needed. The more familiar that I get with the features and settings the more I like it and the more I can do with it.

It tried to shoot my child's soccer games and at 29 minutes it just stops.  When the battery dies. Not a problem right. You just replace with a fresh battery and start shooting again. However when you get home you will find that none of the videos will play if the battery dies or you turn the camera off without stopping the video first and waiting about 2 minutes before you turn the camera off. The reason for this is that the video is saved in an Apple .MOV file which is a wrapper around a audio and video stream.  If the battery dies while you are recording or you forget and turn the camera off without first stopping the video and waiting for the software to create the wrapper with all the metadata to finish and be written around the file then your record video .MOV file wrapper is corrupted and the file is worthless and will not play.  About half of my soccer videos will not play.  There is not any software on the market to fix this corrupted file and recreate the .MOV file wrapper.  Nikon does not support it with repair software to fix your corrupted .MOV  file.  Never buy this camera for the HD video.  It is OK for still pictures.  It will leave you angry and pissed once you lose a few of your precious videos.  Also it will stop when the video file size reaches 3,156,556  KB exactly 29 minutes.

It seemed to have all the features I wanted.  Yeah!Then I got it out in the real world for the first time.  WOW, disappointing is all I can say.I was used to my old camera going through 600 shots in 8+ hours and filling up the memory card before it EVER lost battery power.This one, I got around 230 shots into a trip to a theme park and not even 2.5 hours into the park, where I started to take photo's with a FULLY charged battery, the battery died.I was shocked!!!I had the GPS on, and figured that was what was draining the battery.  So the next day, after charging all night long, I took it back out, without the GPS or any other features on.This time it lasted around 4 hours and I got over 380 shots.  Not bad, but still nothing close to the 8+ hours and over 600 shots I used to get.Now, a lot of you might be saying, wow, that's great, however I have to compare it to both my old one, and my DSLRs (Not Nikon's).  The DSLR's (One from 2007, one from 2012) get in upwards of 2-3000 (Thousand, not a typo) shots (10 & 16MP respectively), and I've only once run out of battery power (Shooting over 3000 shots in less than 2 hours).Now, yes the DSLR has a larger battery, but it also has GPS on all the time.I find this Nikon is SERIOUSLY under powered.Just to compare, my friend has a S6300, and can take more shots and over an entire day this camera.KEEP LOOKING, and make sure to look at the battery life.A helpful hint, review how many shots you take on average, not just the one's you keep, but ALL the photos, then determine if the camera has the battery life you want, or plan on buying more battery's and an extra external charger.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "PIECE O' JUNIK!!!!", "Author": "eddep", "ReviewID": "RN718Z4YWRU22", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After buying it, charged it, then played around with the camera some, then set it on a shelf where it sat for about 2 months.

I gave this one to my sister, and bought a different Coolpix - one that uses AA batteries.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Difficult to operate", "Author": "James Allan \"Creative Director Ad Agency\"", "ReviewID": "R30QK1ZISM8K1Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm a pro photographer for the past 25 years using only Nikon equipment.  This is not Nikon quality it has very confusing operational system and there are lots of cheap little plastic parts that are certain to break with any amount of use.  Lots of unnecessary  doo dads that can drive you crazy. Also trying to focus or frame something witha jiggling little tv screen is just stupid.
