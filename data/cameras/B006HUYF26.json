Its  hard to find decent sized bags nowadays, so apart from my big, big, gear case and my little travel bag, I decided to buy this as my midrange camera case. Its made of nice smooth nylon, and its not really a solid color. It has interesting weave. I like the fact that its two toned so the bottom of the case doesnt get dirty. Overall, fits my nikon body, and three lenses :)))))", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Julie S", "ReviewID": "R381R23BV9N1PZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a bag for my new camera, but did not want something that screams \"this is a camera\"  This bag totally met all wants and needs.
