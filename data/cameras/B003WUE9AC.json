I installed them under my overhang of my house out of the weather. They both failed within 3 months. The camera power cord failed along with the camera on both. I did get one sent back and took me 3 weeks just to get there customer service on the line. When you return this junk do so on the website. You do have to pay for the shipping it to SVAT.  I paid good money for these cameras and am so disappointed. The real kicker was they sent me a new one but didn't even tell me what was wrong with the first one I returned. This manufacture need a lesson it customer service. Buy one with great reviews only.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great deal", "Author": "Joseph F Benedict", "ReviewID": "RTI0L3MUUSG2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product worked well and easy to use.i would recamend it to a friend.the price was right .
