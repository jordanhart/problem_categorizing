{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not too shabby... UPDATED: \"Fantastic\"", "Author": "MeredithNCSU girl", "ReviewID": "RJF9DPXHUMCQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, let me preface where this review is coming from. I am an amateur photographer who is a \"Canon Girl\" and has a Canon 50D as my primary DSLR \"love of my life\". Therefore, this may credit or discredit me in any way that you see fit in reading this! I've been in the market for a new compact for quite some time since my beloved Olympus lost its functionality last year(which happened to be my first taste in photography believe it or not several years ago..of course electronics do not last forever). I decided to take the plunge and purchase a camera that was so new that it did not have reviews on it yet!First things first, this may or may not be a surprise, but the package does NOT come with a memory card. I suppose I'm used to these things coming with some sort of crappy low memory card to at least get you started. But, no worries, SanDisk makes a pretty inexpensive and of \"ok\" quality card. Amazon does not list what kind of memory cards this takes, (SD, SDHC, SDXC)Second, MOST surprisingly, I actually read the users manual. I, like many others, tend to want to go the \"I'll figure it out as I go\" route. The manual was helpful and explained things at length.Third, software installation pretty simple...however, I did have some trouble figuring out how to actually upload some sample photos that I took, but the manual gave me a fantastic instruction. That said, this will just go to show that the manual is pretty well written and in laymen's terms should that be of concern.Fourth, went out to test drive it a bit. I suppose I feel as if I should have the knowledge/mental capacity being that I lead a part-time job being a photographer, however, it IS something new and change is difficult...BUT, it was simple to operate not to mention that it's pretty cool that the screen shows you AND MOVES with your targeted subject. I got clean, crisp photos. My favorite part of this camera is that when working with difficult \"subjects\", which in my case happened to be my rambunctious boxer/pit 2 2/12 year old dog, the moment you close on the shutter release, it captures exactly what you were intending. So, no more blurry head moves and smiles that you did not catch in time. BRILLIANT.Overall, the reason why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because I read about all this nifty artsy stuff you could do with the camera, however, I couldn't seem to figure it out right off hand.  (I JUST got this yesterday). Regardless, so far it seems to be a great little camera and I am looking forward to utilizing it more with events in my life that don't have much room for my big DSLR to be attached at my hip!! (note: I may update later when I get further into using it)UPDATE: 4/3/12I've had the camera now for a few weeks. I JUST figured out YESTERDAY how to use the \"artistic\" features for the camera. It took me forever to figure it out. Apparently, Canon has gotten a bit lazy and you now need to DOWNLOAD the ENTIRE manual from the CD you receive. My co-worker and I had a blast playing with the features. The toy camera, fish eye, and the miniature art features are really fun. Which is EXACTLY what I was looking for in this camera. Therefore, I upgraded my review for 5 stars!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera for those that just want to take basic photos", "Author": "Southern Girl", "ReviewID": "RWP2DWHALDH0T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do not know a lot about photography, but I was recently in the market for a small, easy to carry point and shoot camera to replace my 4 year old Canon. I decided to stick with the same brand, as I had no problems from my last camera - I just wanted something a little more up to date. The A2400 has satisfied my needs. It is great for taking photographs indoors as well as outside. My photography mainly focuses on taking shots of my son and the products I review (I am a blogger), and the many different settings allow my photos to be more fun and unique than before.I do have problems getting a clear photograph sometimes, even when my son or other subject is completely still and the camera  is on the auto setting. I don't exactly know what is causing it not to focus on the subject - but it's quite annoying, especially with a toddler. Other than that, I have no complaints.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Shiala", "ReviewID": "RE26CIQD2G766", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually use my Canon EOS 60D, but I wanted a small camera to just take along to have a quality camera with me, that's not too heavy and bulky. The image quality is great. I love all the gimmicky features, some of which I used to create with Photoshop later, thus it saves me time :) It looks neat and until now I haven't had any problem with the shooting delay I read about. I recommend to get a nice secure camera bag for this one, to avoid scratches to the screen and body.Overall I love it and the images and videos are excellent!", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "EXCEPTIONAL CAMERA!", "Author": "L.A. Summer", "ReviewID": "R1L2QVPAPT2CB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a huge fan of Canon cameras for many years. I've used professional camera (Canon DSLR 60D) to powershot (Canon SX110IS: 9mp, 10x optical zoom) and I have to admit this Canon A2400 is A GREAT DEAL!  When it arrived in the mail, I was extremely disappointed by its size, thinking \"no way, this little junk needs to go back\".  It's smaller than most powershots out there, but once I started to turn on the flash, it blew me away. For this little camera, the flash was so amazing for capturing shots in dark rooms. Best of all, unlikeSX110IS using AA batteries, it came with a Li Battery and a charger. The video mode was also very good, allowed zoom-in/out while video-taping, and the voice was clear. I only paid 1/3  the price I paid for my SX110IS. Cameras are getting cheaper and technology is getting better. There's no reason not to own a Canon!", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!!!", "Author": "D. Veith", "ReviewID": "R2BL12UVM17CUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By a 14-year old girl: After looking at dozens of different point and shoot digital cameras, I finally chose this one and am so glad I did!It's great at taking pictures that come out crisp and clear. There are also a couple different effects which are really fun and cool. Plus some of the effects (like \"vivid\") make some pictures come out better. The camera is slim and pretty-I love the ice blue color! It takes a lithium ion battery, which was new territory for me, because I'm used to AAs! :) But it worked out fine and the battery charged up pretty quick. It also has a slow motion option when watching videos, which is very cool!!This is my second camera. My first was a 7MP Polaroid and although it took GREAT pictures this camera is an obvious step up.I would totally reccommend this camera!!!!!! It's amazing!", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Friendly Point and Shoot", "Author": "Bob Rossi", "ReviewID": "RKVAL5ODLY7TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife.  She's owned a number of P&S; models of all types (Nikon, Samsung, Sony, Kodak) over the last 10 years, but this compact model seems to surpass them all for ease-of-use, quality and sharpness.  The battery stayed charged through a 3-day trip through NYC.  I research the CANON PowerShot prior to purchasing it at Amazon and had to be careful to pick the right model, the A2400, because CANON seems to have a diverse product line. It also seemed that most purchasers of this model were content with the purchase so that sealed the deal for me.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love, Love, Love My New Camera!", "Author": "Sunsetserenity", "ReviewID": "R3Q8IQXCB6JFB2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love, love, love my new Canon PowerShot A2400 Digital Camera.

Motion blur is bad in low lighting.  Hard to take pictures of young kids b/c they move around so much.  Lightweight and convenient otherwise.  Pictures are quite good outside and in good lighting.  Very intuitive and easy to use (for those of us too impatient to read through the whole user's manual.)Better than the other Canon PowerShots b/c it comes with a cord to attach to computer, battery and charger.  Must buy separate memory card (great deals on Amazon) to even use it the first time.Use Wikipedia to shop between different Canon PowerShot models.I have a DSLR but find it too big and inconvenient to use a lot of the time.

The DSLR Xsi, the powershot SD500, SD550's, SD870IS's, etc.  This A2400 line is the worst I have ever seen from Canon.  For a 16 megapixel camera, it has horrible focus, colors, and it's very SLOOOW to use.  I could not believe the poor picture quality.

In fact, it's so smart that it can automatically take a picture when your subject smiles or winks, or when you get out from behind the tripod and enter the frame.

My wife and I ordered this camera for our daughter for Christmas, we got it on a lightning deal for a decent price. I believe it was $69.99 (normally $129.99). After taking the camera for a test drive, I learned that the image quality of the photos from this camera even in perfect lighting and settings (I set up my lights and backdrops, the whole nine yards). I snapped a few photos of my daughter, upon looking at them on the LCD screen, the photos seem to be pretty nice but once I downloaded the photos to my computer to do a little post processing I realized that the photos are extremely dirty looking and way too noisey and there is no post processing that can fix these kind of issues. The photos appear to be extremely splotchy. So I decided that maybe it was too much for the camera to handle and took it out for a casual run at a local park. I ran into some ducks and geese and got snap happy, playing with different settings and snapping and changing settings again and snapping some more. I came home and transferred the photos to my computer and opened up Lightroom 4 to do a little post processing and the photos were the same as the first round in my studio.My opinion is stay away from this camera, I am a fan of canon and they usually produce pretty decent photos but this camera is not worth the heartache. I know people say you get what you pay for but in this case it isn't even worth that much. I can get better results going to the store and picking out a disposable 35mm film camera. Don't waste your money or time on this camera. Canon makes much better cameras than these and this is pretty disapointing for my daughter because she enjoys going out on photo shoots with me and I thought this would be a good starter camera for her.
