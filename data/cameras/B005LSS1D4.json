The picture is very clear and has a wide angle. Unfortunately  like another reviewer stated the product eats batteries constantly whether you use it or not. This is a major electrical flaw. The screen illuminates for ~ 3 seconds.  I probably use 2-3 times a week, so ~ 9 seconds. You constantly have to change batteries constantly which is ridiculous The batteries should easily last for a year . To add insult you have to unscrew very small screws and take off the whole product to do so which is a pain. When you go to their website they have no customer service number or contact number.. I should have seen this before; I would have never bought it. Amazon only gives you 30 days. I am basically out $100I would like to warn others.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent picture but installation instructions flawed", "Author": "A. Neilll", "ReviewID": "R3QEIB4SMPX0Z2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Cannon Peephole viewer is a nifty device.  It delivers a fairly clear picture of the other side of your door, without having to open it, delivering it to a small digital screen that you mount on the inside of your door.=-=-=- Advantages over a regular peephole  =-=-=-=Basically, it shows you what you would see through a peephole on the small screen; but this has several advantages1) More than one person can look at the Cannon viewer at once, so you can compare notes on who it might be or if you should let them in2) If the person at the door is suspicious, you can easily use your phone cam to take a picture of the image on the screen for use later, if needed3) More comfortable to watch for an extended period4) A reverse peephole viewer is useless against this device.5) Easier for kids than looking through a peepholeWhat would make this a really killer device would be if it has ability to interface with other devices, for example, if I could look out my peephole when I am down in the basement. Also, nightvision would be an excellent addition. But this device wasn't designed for that and I don't subtract anything for those .However, the picture quality on the viewer I got is a bit grainy, perhaps it is because I have mostly used it in lower light with just a porch light.=-=-=-=  Installation =-=-=-=As far as installation, it took me about 30 minutes.  I suspect it could have gone faster, but for some deficiencies in the documentation.  Perhaps it was just me, but it wasn't that clear in the instructions that you had to remove the plate first, and the diagrams and figures didn't show clearly how the viewer attaches to the door.  Again, your mileage may vary, but it seemed like it could have been made clearer with a better diagram.Also, the instructions were absolutely wrong as far as camera orientation.  I had to turn the camera part until the red arrow was pointed nearly 180 degrees in the other direction indicated in the instructions, which means now it is not really that tight in the door.  When I have a few minutes, I will probably take it out and re-seat it.Another issue I had with the instructions is that my door was a little thicker, so the plate would not properly align to the back of the camera piece until I started to screw on the base. That just made me a little confused on if perhaps had the alignment of the door plate incorrect, since the figure showing how the plate attaches to the door is not that great to begin with.Still I am pleased with the device.  Already I have been able to use the device to show someone at the door to my kids.  So while I have kept my old peephole just in case, I think the Cannon Peephole Viewer is a definite keeper.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Batteries died", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1SJAPMRJTYFUN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Installed a month ago then went on vacation for 3 weeks.

Only you can decide if the price is worth the extra over a traditional optical only unit.This will provide a larger easier to identify image of the people outside, where the optical unit is much cheaper and doesn't have batteries.

It installed easily, about 10 minutes if you already have a peephole. If you don't have an existing peephole, you'll need to drill a hole in your door to install this.Once I removed our current peephole, I put the camera through the existing hole and the mounting plate of the video display. As a install note - do not remove the screen protector over the camera eye until you are done installing. It has an arrow to show which way is up for the camera device.The camera fits in the peephole and the video display plate with a screw back that keeps them both in place. There are additional screws included if you want to mount it more securely but it wasn't necessary for us and since we have a metal door, I didn't want to drill into it anymore than necessary. Batteries are included and replacing the batteries is as simple as removing two screws that secure the mount plate at the bottom of the screen.The picture quality is fine, much better than our original peephole. Our front door is always in shadow but this shows clearly enough and appropriately for the light quality. The panoramic view of the background is good for getting the 'big picture' of what is going on outside. Your guest can look pretty close to the camera and still provide a clear picture.In defense of the product, my video does not show the full quality of the image that actually displays. It is more natural in coloring (the video is a little bluish) and the shadows have more detail in real life.I've had a security camera with a display before but it required too much installation and drilling through walls so I was hesitant to use it. This is a piece of cake and a great way to get that security camera view without a lot of installation. It will not record anything though so if you are looking for a higher end security device for more complete monitoring, this is not it.The display turns off after 10 seconds but a simple push and it comes back on instantly.The specs say that it is good for a door 1.57\" to 2.76\" (40mm-70mm) and the barrel diameter for the camera is 9/16\" to 27/32\" (14mm-22mm).", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "So Much Better Than A Peephole", "Author": "Tara M.

I got mine and followed assembly instructions (including the requirement to push in the camera plug all the way before turning it on).  I had to make only a small adjustment in order to get the metal bracket below the frame of the skylight that is 2 inches above my peephole hole in the door.  Since I have some handyman experience the installation was a breeze.  I turned the unit on and behold the front porch and walkway were seen in full color.  The LCD monitor on the inside of the door is very clear, crisp and displays accurate colors unlike many cameras I also have around the house for security.  To use the unit you approach the door and merely push in the \"on\" button.  The screen stays lit for approximately 4 seconds - long enough to see who is outside.  If you need more time you can always press the button again.The unit seems to be sturdy in construction.  Instructions are very brief but adequate for assembly and installation.  A warning sheet also accompanies the instructions to remind you the importance of pluging in the camera completely before use otherwise you can damage the circuitry of the unit.  The only reason I did not give the DDV-S-01 5 stars is that the peephole camera unit came to me with a cracked front glass on the exterior peephole.  Perhaps someone at the company dropped the unit before packaging it and cracked the glass.  Hopefully I can have it replaced because exposure to outside humidity will ruin most digital camera chips that are exposed to humidity over time.Absent this one defect the Cannon Security Products DDV-S-01 LCD Peephole Door Viewer is one great security product![UPDATE] I contacted the company and they sent me overnight a replacement glass for the exterior peep hole.  That is incredible service and means a lot to me as a consumer.  The company's service department was very accessible and helpful.  This is what you want when you invest in an electronic device.  Because of good service and backing up their product I have changed my rating to 5 stars.  I noticed that in an earlier review of this product by another consumer that the company also offered them a replacement of the product even though the breakage of the product was the obvious fault of the other reviewer.  That review should be changed by that reviewer if the company makes good on their promise to replace the product in fairness to the seller.  And hopefully this time he or she will follow instructions when assembling and installing the unit. :  I think this is a great product and well worth considering for door security.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "The whole family can see who's at the door", "Author": "Big Al \"Alan Rivi\u00e8re\"", "ReviewID": "R20IQH1JGXYOSL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To install this Cannon Peephole Door Viewer, the hardest part is to drill a hole through the door; the rest is quite easy.  You need a power drill and a 9/16\" drill bit and you should be able to drill the hole straight through the door, not at an angle.  Metal doors may present additional challenge.  The camera unit will fit doors from 1.57\" to 2.76\" thick.  Once the hole is drilled, installing this peephole door viewer is a breeze.Generally, this is what you do: Undo the two small bolts at the bottom of the LCD unit and remove the metal mounting plate at the back.  That exposed the battery compartment and the camera mini-plug socket.  Install the 4 AA batteries included.  Unscrew the locking barrel of the camera unit.  Insert the camera from the outside through the door and the center hole of the mounting plate, making sure that the lens is facing outward and the red arrow on the protective film on the lens is pointing up.  Orient the mounting plate such that the white gasket is against the door and the \"UP arrow\" is pointing up.  Screw on the locking barrel of the camera unit to secure the camera and mounting plate on the door.  There are three screw holes on the mounting plate for additional screws (included) to hold the plate securely on the door.  Insert the mini-plug of the camera into the socket of the LCD unit.  There is a warning message attached to it regarding the right way and the wrong way to insert the mini-plug.  It is important that you push the mini-plug all the way into the socket. Failure to do so may short out the camera, according to a spokesman of the seller.  Secure the LCD unit onto the mounting plate with the two locking bolts and the peephole door viewer is operational.Push the ON-OFF button on the viewer and LCD screen displays a picture for 10 seconds.  Contrary to the old style peep-glass, the whole family can see who is at the door at the same time with this Cannon Peephole Door Viewer.  Height differences among family members no longer matter; even a small child can use the viewer as long as he can reach the ON-OFF button.  These are important considerations.  Furthermore, even among adults, it is a more elegant way to peep by observing an LCD screen than pressing an eye against a peep-glass and a cheek flat against the door.  The quality of the picture is acceptable in full daylight but becomes grainy in a low light situation.  I have a problem with the duration of the picture.  It is too short.  If a stranger is at the door and I do not wish to talk to him, I would like to stay quietly behind the door and watch him leave.  Ten seconds is just too short for that.  I wish that the button is set up in a way that I can choose 10, 30, or 60 second duration.

This has been true since the day I installed it, but I thought maybe I was just using it more than average.Recently I decided to test this.  I changed batteries one month ago to the day.  I installed regular Duracel AAs--not the fancy 'optimized for digital devices' ones, not the 'guaranteed to last longer than any other battery ones', just regular Duracel AAs.  I verified the batteries were fully charged (they're brand new) and the unit was working.  I then refrained from touching the viewer for one month.  This morning I pushed the button on the front to activate the view screen, and...nothing.  Removed batteries, tested them, they're dead.31 days, I haven't even activated the device, and it ate four (4) AA batteries.  This is consistent with my experiences during the entire time I've owned this device.  I wondered if there was something wrong with the unit I received, but many other reviews have stated that it goes through batteries quickly.  I wish I'd read a review that explained just how quickly it went through them, even when it's not doing anything.  Could have saved myself $100.

A device like the Cannon DDV-S-01 Peephole viewer is right up my alley for preferred devices.  Why have a simple pee hole when you can have a camera attached LCD viewer?!Gadgetry aside, the DDV-S-01 provides a real security function that is far better than a simple peep hole for 2 significant reasons.1)  It's provides a superior view for all.  I have young children who cannot reach a regular peep hole - they can use this easily.  Even for someone of regular peep hole viewing height, the view is far superior in detail and image.2)  It cannot be reversed.  A regular peep hole is just an optical bubble lenses - people can look though it into your house if they use a $70 \"Tactical Door viewer Peephole Reverser\".  Google it if you don't believe me, then Google Erin Andrews.The actual device itself is comprised of two parts.  A peep hole camera and an electronic viewer.  The camera assembly is very solid and well made.  Heavy for its size, like an expensive camera.  The viewer is plastic, but has a simple elegance.  Installation was a breeze.  I had to drill a 1/2\" hole in my door, as I did not have a peep hole previously installed.  Then it was simply inserting the camera through door and thin mounting plate for viewer and screwing the long nut - quite long to accommodate thicker doors.  After that, plug in viewer, hang on mounting plate, and screw in two retaining screws.  If I hadn't had to drill the hole; I would have had this done in less than 5 minutes.  The bolt holds the mounting plate quite securely and the adhesive tape prevents rotation - I see no reason to mar the door with extra, optional screws.Using the electronic viewer is simple: just press the button.  Image comes on screen in about 1/2 a second and stays on for approximately 12 seconds.  Image is clear and works well even in low light situations.It's too wide for my door.  I have a standard 36\" wide 6 panel entry door.  The center tenon is 4.5 inches wide.  The Cannon DDV is just over 5.5 inches wide.  So, the DDV hangs out half an inch on either side.. over part of the panels.  Looks bad.  Initially I was a bit miffed - thinking there was no vertical mount option.  Then I watched the Canon install video again.Fortunately, there is an option to mount vertical.  But there are two minor annoyances about this.  First, the button and logo are sideways - this is less an issue for button, but logo looks dumb sideways.  Second, in order to hide the mount holes, I need to have power button on the top.  Minor, I know, but I would prefer to have power at bottom as it is easier to reach for little ones.  These are minor annoyances to an otherwise solid product, but will keep it from 5 stars.Note Bene: there is a photo showing horizontal mount near top of door.  That seems unrealistic as a viewer, when horizontal, does not have good vertical reach - you'd see only the tops of shorter persons heads.  It really does need to be mounted lower than that, at normal peep height.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "N2styx", "ReviewID": "R2RM7GXF3ZT3C0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very skeptical at first.

It's more convenient than looking through the peephole, and the viewer has a nice simple design that goes with almost anything. The front evokes the iPod Touch or iPhone: black, LCD screen, one button. It's simple. To be honest, while it's nice not having to look through the peephole with the fisheye lens, as an adult it wasn't that big a deal. To my mind, where this product shines is it makes it much easier for my kids (who aren't tall enough to see through the peephole) to easily see who is at the front door. All they have to do is reach up, push the button, then step back and see who is on the display. They love it.The display is bright and easy to see. The image quality is very good. The camera delivers a nice picture as well--I was surprised at how nice it was. In lower-light situations the picture gets grainy as expected, but is still decent. With a porch light at night it's perfectly fine.This is very easy to mount under normal circumstances, and should only take a few minutes with nothing more than a screwdriver. Unfortunately, the design assumes you have several inches of flat door around your peephole. If you don't, the viewer will not be flush against the door, and can't be installed. This was our situation. To remedy it I had to make a spacer out of some craft wood and drill a hole in it for the camera to go through. I attached the viewer mounting place to the wood, then connected everything. I've included pictures with this review.The product does have a few shortcomings, mostly related to installation. The nut that holds the camera in the door has two flat edges to make tightening easier. The camera body itself is round with no place to grip easily. So when tightening the nut I had difficulty keeping the camera oriented properly, as it was difficult to hold on to. Plus, when looking at the camera it is not obvious which part is \"up\". It comes with a protective sticker that indicates which side is \"up\", but once that sticker is removed you've no way of telling. I marked mine for reference. I consider these minor annoyances, but I think they should be addressed.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Run do not Walk", "Author": "Alex-Chris 1970, 78412", "ReviewID": "R9H4UOQ5UASUC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I read the other reviews first.

The reason I am not posting a review on it until now, is because I had to wait until I could get someone to come out and professionally install it.  We have a metal door, and the hole in it for the peephole was just a little bit too narrow for the camera peephole of this device.  If you have a wooden door, you can just kind of worry the hole wider with a screwdriver, or whatever else you have handy to chisel the wood. But, with a metal door, (if you are careful, like me) you are going to want to have someone come out and professionally install the unit.Once it is installed, though, it is fantastic.  The camera standing in for the peephole eliminates the tell-tale darkening that can be seen outside the door, when the peephole is looked through, which broadcasts that someone is behind the door.  The camera also gives much more detail and a wider field of view than a standard peephole.  Our front landing is well lit, so the camera works well at night as well, so I couldn't tell you how well it works in low lighting, but I would imagine not very well, if most digital cameras I have used are any indicator.The mount for the unit is solid, and the simple cable hookup is easy to deal with, and makes battery replacement a snap.

It lets you clearly see who is on the other side of your door without having to open the door or strain to see through the tiny peephole.The way this peephole works is simple enough. You can install it in about 20 minutes and it attaches itself directly to your front door with the picture- taking lens pointed directly toward the outside. The device is now set and ready to use, providing protection around the clock. You will be able to quickly see, even from a distance, who is at the front door and because of the way it is installed, it protects against the use of a reverse peephole viewer.Kids are often the ones at greatest risk of opening the front door to a stranger and this is yet another nice quality of a product like this. Young children are far too short to look through a peephole viewer, but they will not need to if the Cannon peephole viewer is installed. All they will need to do is look up, at the viewer, and they will clearly see who is knocking on the door. This gives me much greater peace of mind, because I know from experience that my kids are far too prone to just open the door upon hearing a knock. Now, they know to look at the peephole viewer first.The image projected on the screen of this device isn't gigantic, but it is large enough and while not crystal clear, it is clear enough to tell who is on the other side. I agree with other reviewers who have said that this device could be improved if it included some type of interface that would transmit the image so that it could be seen in another part of the house. If it could do this, you could be, say, upstairs in your house and see who is knocking on the door. Perhaps a future version will include an enhancement like this.Safety is important and a device like the Cannon Peephole viewer is a nice addition to any home.

The wide viewing angle is helpful, but the fake photo is unnecessarily misleading. The viewer has no viewing ability in the dark, but worked fine with the porch lights turned on, as well as in daylight.Installation was simple (fits just like a regular peephole).  Hold the camera in place (the \"outside\" part), while screwing in the back half (which also holds the mounting bracket in place).  The viewer hooks over the bracket and small screws hold it in place.On the negative, the viewer's materials look a little plastic-y and cheap, especially if you have a nice door.  Using a metal casing, or all one color, or making it less bulky and obtrusive would make it fit into more settings.The viewer timeout (before the screen blanks again) is very short, maybe 2 seconds.  Making this adjustable, or setting at a more reasonable 5 seconds would be more useful.The viewer is also rather large for what it does.  The thickness of the unit is mostly to house the 4 AA batteries and mounting bracket (and some empty space), it really looks like it could be designed to be much thinner, perhaps using button batteries or AAA's.  Modern phones (that also include a camera) have similar or larger screens (with much other electronics) in considerably thinner packages, so this thing is just unnecessarily bulky.The Cannon name as opposed to Canon which makes cameras confused me, but they are apparently unrelated.I haven't tried any other digital door viewers, so I'm not sure how the competition measures up, but for providing some added functionality and security for my mother, it works well so far (I'll update if it fails or eats batteries), but it could certainly be better-made and more physically streamlined.

(I took the barrel with me to ensure a good tight fit.)  I was a bit afraid that extending the barrel into the back of the display unit might produce a problem but there was adequate clearance.I put the flat washer on the outside of the door and the lock washer inside and tightened everything down snug - but not too tight that it might damage the threads.Like a few other reviewers I found that the little red dot on the outside of the fisheye lens was not accurate or aligned properly, but it wasn't a big deal to rotate the lens until the picture was absolutely level.The viewer took eight days to get from Des Plaines, IL to Northern Ontario, which is more than acceptable considering it had to go through Canada Customs.It took me all of ten minutes (not including the trip to the hardware store) to complete the installation as I already had a peephole viewer in my door.Great product!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Installation warning - read this one", "Author": "R. C. Matcek", "ReviewID": "R36S96S556C42X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I mention my slight warning, The nighttime viewing without my exterior wall-mounted front light on is dark.  However, I would still have no issues distinguishing whether the person is non / invited guest.  It works great with the light on, and I have yet to use it during the day, as I just got done with the install.My image stays on for 9 seconds, and yes pressing it during that time while not shut it off like you would imagine.  It takes 4 AA batteries that are included.As another reviewer mentioned, the unit will not look right if used in the vertical orientation because of their logo and the power button \"image\".  The power button should have been able to be rotated, but in my quick attempt, I could not make it happen.  Also, the power button does not need the \"image\" on it because there is only ONE button on the whole unit; any guesses what it that ONE button may be for?!?!  The fix to make everybody happy would be for them to construct it with a rotatable power button, and just put their logo on it.  Or better yet, remove the logo entirely, and maybe just flash it on the screen before / after the camera's view is displayed.I used a half inch drill bit, and then had to increase the diameter ever-so-slightly to get it to a true 14mm.  I just used a regular (round) smaller drill bit, to shave out the cut-out.  I just used it by applying even pressure for all 360 degrees, and pushed the drill back and forth in a sawing motion.The \"correct side up\" red arrow was slightly off in my case.  But easily resolved with repetitive test-fits while plugging in and checking out the display each time.Finally, on to my main installation gripping, which is really more of a manufacturer's issue, but had I known I could have adjusted to resolve it, but maybe now you can pre-resolve it.  I am just assuming this is true for all models, and mine is not a one-off / lemon.  I drilled the hole perfectly centered where my vertical and horizontal stiles come together in the middle of my wooden door.  The panels in between all the stiles are thinner and sculpted / ornamental.  When I put it all together, I glanced at its final resting place, no do-overs, and I hoped what I saw was just my imagination or an illusion (since I mounted it lower than my eye level).The MANUFACTURER did not place the drilled hole in the absolute center of the unit!  WTH!  The final dimensions from the top and bottom of the unit to the adjacent thinner panels are off by an 1/8th of an inch.  I know its not much, but I notice it, and it is in a noticeable place, on a \"nice\" front entry wood door.  But there is no excuse, they should have centered it; how hard could it be?Well easy fix for you, not me.  And please, carefully measure the unit and verify that yours is not centered as well and is off the same dimensions I mention before proceeding with this simple solution.MARK THE CENTER OF WHERE YOU WANT IT MOUNTED, AND DRILL ONLY 1/16TH OF AN INCH ABOVE IT!
