It would randomly crash, so we've got lots of holes in our security record.  Furthermore, the playback interface is very clunky and non-intuitive.  There is no fine tuning or ability to change the scrubbing rate, so pinpointing an exact time is very difficult.Tried to update the software to the latest version, now it won't run at all.  What a waste of money.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very dissapointing", "Author": "Lana Childs \"Lana\"", "ReviewID": "RUR2ETWCCACNC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like the other reviewer said, the cameras seem to work fine, but being able to use the software or see our business on our home computer works sporatically at best and now not at all.

We had the system less than a year before our first failure. It was \"repaired\" under warranty after lots of going back and forth. The \"repair\" didn't last long, so we gave up on it. Decided to give their repair services another shot, but could never get them by phone or email. Took the unit to a local, reputable repair shop for analysis and they found that the motherboard had been replaced the first go-around, but the processor had not been mounted properly and their service techs had not only bent a pin on the processor, they hadn't mounted the cooling fan properly either. We decided against further repair efforts because even if it had been repaired, it wasn't worth keeping. The ONE f-ing time it might have come in handy was after our second break-in. Thieves had decided to take out the power meter prior to the break-in, but we had a camera pointed right at it, so we figured we might have caught something. Apparently, it doesn't write to the hard drive in real time, so the recording just stopped and it didn't capture the theft of the meter. Or anything else. Total waste of money, so please avoid this product like the plague. It doesn't work for long and will not perform as advertised.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "item delivery not what ordered!", "Author": "jimmy lee", "ReviewID": "R1AU58DQ5GCQ0L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Product delivery not match what ordered.
