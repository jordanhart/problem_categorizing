{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent image quality with very good portability", "Author": "\"ainamacar\"", "ReviewID": "R2OS6Y287GCRKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The major pros of the Optio 550 are its overall image quality, 5x lens, battery life, feature set, and portability.  The major downsides I've experienced are ISO noise, a slightly slow zoom and autofocus, and a delay in shutter release.  A few other problems are ignorable or easily fixable in photoshop (vignetting) or can be largely fixed in camera settings (indoor photos).Size and Build: I wanted a camera that is unobtrusive and the Optio 550 is certainly small enough.  It is not a one-hand camera because of the weight, but it fits my hands (which I believe are slightly below average male size) very well.  In addition, the build feels solid.Image Quality: On the whole, very excellent.  ISO noise is a problem (400 is unusable, 200 is marginal and will probably depend on your tolerance for grain, 100 and 64 are just fine) and so this camera isn't best for lots of shots in dark spaces, especially if the flash won't be able to illuminate the subject.  In some of my images there has also been minor vignetting (slightly darkened corners) and according to dpreview.com, which has a good review, this occurs in wide-angle to half-zoom shots.  Most of the time it is barely noticeable, and it is never a showstopper because a forum member at dpreview.com created a Photoshop file that can be used to easily correct the problem, which I have so far used a few times with good results... Cropping out the affected portion is, of course, another option.  Otherwise, the image quality has been excellent, provided one sets and keeps the sharpness (and possibly also contrast, this seems to be more a matter of taste) down a notch from the default value.  Outdoor images are, in my experience, sharp and detailed using the camera on full auto.  Indoor images without good illumination are a bit harder for this camera, but forcing the camera to use ISO 64 or 100, in conjunction with the lower sharpness/contrast settings, will almost always give a very good photo.  I am colorblind, so I will not offer an opinion on color accuracy.  The comments of others on this aspect seem to be uniformly positive, however.  The camera has three levels of JPEG compression, as well as a TIFF mode.  The visible difference between ** and *** images is very difficult to see, but ** is about half the size.  Users who aren't scrutinizing or heavily editing images will probably find that a very suitable compromise.  The purist in me wants to use TIFF but my budget demands otherwise, so I usually stick with ***.Battery life: Quite long.  I was, for instance, able to go a week of casual picture taking (perhaps 15 pictures a day, no flash) with around two-three hours (all told) of nothing but reviewing pictures before it finally ran out.  An AC adapter is not included, unfortunately, although a charger is.The lens: The 5x optical zoom was a major selling point for me, and I have already appreciated its ability to get me up close several times.  At this point in time, if you value small size and zoom capabilities, no other camera is its equal.  It takes about 2 seconds to completely zoom in from a wide shot, which sometimes seems too slow.  The Optio 550 has a 4x digital zoom also, but this type of zooming is best done after the fact with Photoshop or something else anyway, so I turned it off.Feature set:  Has full auto, full manual, an aperture priority and a shutter priority mode all of which operate as expected.  Movie quality is adequate, but not great.  The sound quality of annotations and movies is quite decent, however.  Several filters (for color, softness, etc) are available which I haven't used.  Modes for certain picture types (sunsets, snow, portraits, etc.).  Of these, I've only used sunset and fireworks so far.  The manual neglects to mention that fireworks mode sets a long shutter time, requiring the camera to remain motionless.  3D and panorama modes.  The continuous shooting mode is about a frame per second at full resolution.  The flash can be on, off, on with red-eye reduction, autoflash, or autoflash with red-eye reduction.  The camera will display a histogram on the lcd live or after the fact.  There is a 3x3 grid overlay available on the lcd to help framing.  There is a mode for taking movies more slowly, allowing playback to appear faster, in addition to time-delay and time-interval settings.  Two macro modes.  More that I don't have space to detail.LCD: Sharp enough, bright enough.  No adjustable brightness settings, however.  In bright sunlight it is, as others have noted, difficult to see.  You can also elect to turn it off.Miscellaneous:  The autfocus is a bit slow, there is a slight but noticeable lag between pressing the shutter release and the actual picture, and these in combination with the fairly slow zoom will probably make some action shots very difficult to capture.  Includes ACDSee software, and USB/NTSC cables.  The SD card that comes with the camera is an anemic 16MB, so buying a 128MB or 256MB card is a necessity.  I use the user mode on the camera to hold all my indoor shot settings, which means that I am always only a turn of a single knob away from alleviating indoor image concerns.Conclusion: Given all the positives, I think the negatives are outweighed.  I think the Optio 550 offers the best overall quantity of features and quality of images for a \"take anywhere\" camera of any that I researched before purchasing.  The price is excellent as well, considering what it offers.

The Pentax Optio has changed all that. I have been using this camera for about a month now, and my poor Canon F1 has stayed in its case.  I am simply STUNNED with the quality of the image, the ease & accuracy of the \"point and shoot\" features, and the impressive array of options that Pentax offers me.  Battery life seems excellent, the camera has survived a tough month in the field in high humidity/salt air being jostled and banged (and dropped at least once) in transfers from boats to dories to shore, and the 5x optical zoom lets me get reasonably close to my birds (it still isn't a \"real\" telephoto, don't be confused, but it beats the heck out of other digital cameras that I have played with).  Downsides are that the enclosed 16mb card is a joke, I didn't even bother with it, get at least a 64mb & start shooting. The lens DOES take a while to extend, and there is a slight-but-noticeable delay between pressing shutter release & the actual image. This is annoying in an \"action\" setting. In addition, the viewscreen, while brighter than I expected, is invisible in bright sunlight.  The biggest problem with this (the optical viewfnder is just fine for actually taking photos) is that messages like \"memory card full\" may not be conveyed to you unless you look really closely -I lost half a dozen pictures from not paying attention. Overall I am VERY impressed with this camera, it is light, portable, versatile, gives me very high quality pictures, and seems tough enough to stand up to a demanding life on off-shore seabird colonies.

Robbins", "ReviewID": "R20CP4XNUX7MZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Optio 550 to replace my original Kodak DC215.  I was looking for a camera with decent Optical zoom, good photo resolution, and not something so big I would dread carrying it around.So far I have been VERY pleased with this camera.  It weighs significantly less than the Kodak, and is a good deal smaller too.  It's a little big to put in your pocket, but I was able to get a reasonably small camera case which will work very well.The pictures I have taken so far have all been very good quality, and you can't beat the 5MP resolution :)  Connecting it to my computer was a snap, and the menus and options while a little bit criptic, provide easy access to lots of features.I only have 2 complaints with this camera.  1) You will DEFINITELY need a larger memory card.  The bundled 16MB card will only hold 4 pictures at the highest quality setting (below TIFF).  However, this is true with every single digital camera I was looking at so I can't hold it against Pentax.  2) The movie mode does not support Optical zoom, only digital zoom.  I have no idea why they did this, but for some reason you cannot use the optical zoom while shooting movies.  Granted, this is a still picture camera, and I will probably seldom use the video mode, but it seems to be a very strange oversight.I would DEFINITELY recommend this camera to anyone who wants a relatively easy to use camera, that takes very good pictures.", "Date": "August 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Outstanding camera of all occassion, but not picture perfect", "Author": "Roy Chan", "ReviewID": "R3VITUH6JO3RLZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Very compact for its specs; comprehensive feature set; high-quality images; long battery life.Cons: Autofocus speed average at best; continuous-shooting mode only 1fps; no slow-sync flash setting; no RAW mode.I recently brought the Pentax Optio 550 and this camera has a wide range of possibilities.

First of all the noise levels at 400, and even 200 can be hideous. Just go to user mode and set the ISO to 64 or 100. Then set the Exposure Compensation to +1 or +1.3.

The \"Snow/Sea\" setting allowed me to take pictures of some backlighted objects.3. The \"Distance\" setting allowed me to shoot through glass with little back reflection.4.

Other cameras using the same sensor have much less noise.  The problem likely comes from too high sharpening used by the camera which Pentax could probably easily fix by issuing a firmware update, which so far they have not done.  If you are looking to use this camera in low light conditions, it is probably not the camera for you, as you would have to do extensive noise reduction on images above 8 x 10.This noise is not a problem if the ISO setting is set at 64 and the sharpness and contrast settings on the camera are set to low.

Nowadays 5 megapixels and 5x optical zoom can easily be topped for a lot less money, but back when this camera came out (at least 5 years ago I think) it was so great.  I took it everywhere, played with it all the time.  Like, constantly.  I finally got a DSLR but even then it was nice to have a little point and shoot for the times I didn't want to lug my DSLR around (also a Pentax, love love love Pentax).Well after years of abuse, my Pentax Optio 550 finally stopped focusing properly.  Battery life and picture quality were still just fine.  I was sad to replace this one.  But today I wouldn't recommend buying this exact model camera because it is old and outdated.  You want a newer model with more megapixels and even more optical zoom.  But when it came out it was pretty freakin' sweet.

I sold so many Pentax cameras, I won a cruise!  That's how many I sold.

She was mad that it broke everytime she dropped it on the tile, with the lens out, from a standing position.  I'm sorry but they just aren't meant to be dropped lens-first on tile.  After the first time we fixed it for her (free of charge by the way) she let her little kids run around with it and they broke it too.  That lady didn't need a digital camera, in my opinion she needed one of those Fisher-Price rugged cameras made for toddlers.  Everyone else who bought a Pentax from me came in to print their pictures all the time, and every time they came in they just talked forever about how much they loved it and they would ask me to show them more neat features on it.
