It takes great pictures, even when used by my kids.  I got it for them because I'm never in any of our photos.  It's easy enough for them to use yet has some more advanced features.  Not as good as my Canon Elph, but worth the money.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Buy", "Author": "felicia taylor \"Felicia\"", "ReviewID": "R3N7R9N68ZRMEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this item for my 16 yr old daughter since the price was reasonable. She loves to takes pictures and is following in her mother's footsteps. Well was I surprised when she showed me that her camera has as many if not more features than my expensive HP camera. She love the color and goes through all of the features with ease. This is definately an excellent buy and I definately recommend this camera for any adult and any teenager. It has all the features you would need for a point and shoot camera w/ some extras.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Can't believe how good this camera is for kids.", "Author": "Warren Keating \"keatingart\"", "ReviewID": "R2EQ3YR46LP0UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Santa brought this for my 7-year-old daughter. I read most of the reviews on many of the inexpensive digital cameras and realized that it may or may not work. Taking a risk, I bought this one and it has proven extremely reliable and functional. My daughter loves its video option and has had no problem figuring out all of the menus and options that the camera offers. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a small, inexpensive digital camera.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "polaroid camera", "Author": "Husker Lover", "ReviewID": "RQFZ9MDU2M5CY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful camera, takes excellent pictures.

She took a whole bunch of pictures with it and then the camera lost them. She tried a memory stick and it still went to hell. She was very upset because the pictures that she had taken were priceless, it was the first time in forever since she had her own camera and this one was just not worth the money. The picture quality was pixilated and of poor quality, it wouldnt have been worth the money to have the photos printed if they hadnt been deleted/black screen of death.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great lil cam", "Author": "Zhinga Greaves \"ShadyVille ENT\"", "ReviewID": "R16DT0VLEW7BSD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think it a nice lil camera,it works rele well,but not in dark conditions,,Once u master the flash setting -U'll find the camera Irie!!", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Oh dear!", "Author": "M. Macaire \"mmmgood7\"", "ReviewID": "R3O840RZEU9X57", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday.  Green is her favorite color, so she was delighted when she opened up her gift.  But her joy quickly turned to disappointment when the camera would turn on and then freeze.  She could not even take one picture.  We changed batteries to make sure it wasn't the batteries.  Needless to say we returned the camera.  I would be skeptical to order another camera like this one.", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera", "Author": "Grrr V \"Grrr V\"", "ReviewID": "RN7ENES2OLDJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a pretty good one.  I was unaware of how few pictures it could take w/o a memory card, but that was probably my error.
