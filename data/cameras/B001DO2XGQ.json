I'm so disappointed that I'm taking the time to write my first review ever.This is a beautiful camera. I took it to my company party and everyone asked me about it. People love the fact that you can scroll through pictures \"IPhone style\". But the pictures from the party came out terrible. It was grainy and sometimes blurry. I dismissed it because I was still sooo hot for this camera.When I start taking pictures and videos of my kids at home, the true color came out. Under bright indoor condition, the color looked awful. The video switches color while the video is being taken! Picture looked reddish at times. I started playing in the manual mode and it did look a little better. But still not nearly as good as my 4+ year old 5M camera. Outdoor shots the pictures looked ok.My mother in law was also in the market for a new camera so I lend her the S60. She's not very tech savvy so it's a real world test. She immediately had problems with the viewing and the \"flipping\" of the pictures. She also had problem zooming pictures in and out. Needless to say she didn't like it. I bought her a T700 from Sony and she loves it.I already got the return # from Amazon and it'll be my first return ever from an online purchase. I hope you find my review helpful. I used to work in a photo lab and I owned 2 digital cameras before. Both, sadly to say, were better than the S60.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Imature technology, unresponsive touch screen, battery-hog, and poor playback quality", "Author": "G. LO", "ReviewID": "R3J3QHW44ZLRNW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The idea of this product was very good.  That's why I couldn't wait to get one for my wife.  Unfortunately, the technology is just not mature at all.First, the touch screen responsiveness is wildly inconsistent.  Usually, it responds immediately.  However, sometimes, it takes 3 to 5 sec.  You would think that you didn't touch correctly and you would try to touch again, and again.  Then you would have touched the same thing twice or 3 times.  And you would have to undo the 2nd or 3rd touches.Second, the battery won't last 100 shots. If you use flash or touch the screen a lot, it probably is good for 60 or 70 shots.  You would need 2 or 3 batteries for your trips if you plan to take a lot of shots.Picture quality is so-so.  For a 10 mega-pixel camera, I expect a lot more than my old Canon 4 mega-pixel P&S.;  Even though my old pictures were taken in low resolution mode (300k to 500k in size each only) and the pictures from this camera were taken at the highest quality mode (4+ M in size each), I hardly notice any difference.  Needless to say, there is not even any comparison with my Olympus e-520 DSLR.For a while, I thought video taking would be ok.  It responded pretty fast.  Sound wasn't too bad either.  However, when I downloaded and watch the video on my computer, it was truly disappointing.Worst of all, on the live view, your pictures would look even worse.  So bad that I didn't even know if any of the pictures I took would be decent.  I guess the good thing was they all looked a bit better on the computer than on the live view playback mode since the live view screen was just plain terrible.I should have given it a 1 star, but I gave it 2 just because of the innovative idea.  But the quality of this product is just plain terrible.  And it is the first Vietnam-made electronic product that I have ever seen.  I think that may explain the poor quality.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon S60 Does Well", "Author": "Auburn Fan", "ReviewID": "R2N40IJGOHKW75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had much better experience with my Nikon S60 than the other reviewers. We were headed on a vaction to Big Sur, and the cameras came out 2 weeks before we left. First one I received from Amazon had a cold solder joint internal to the camera, and would quit working when exposed to a 5 to 10 degree temp change. Amazon quickly replaced it (Thanks Amazon) and we were off to the coast. Took about 200 pics and videos during the trip, with most being big scenery. I agree with the other reviewers about the screen delay....but that is why it got a 4 instead of a 5. Picture quality was good, and the screen was easy to read, with no deciphering functions of tiny buttons grouped together like other P&S; I tried. Once using the camera, it was easy to switch between still and video, though it took about 3 screen taps. Zoom was impressive, including the digital zoom. Using the digital zoom, you have to be stabilized on something...tripod, fence, etc or the pics come out blurry. I took some great face shots of harbor seals that were about 25 feet away, but I had the camera on the pier handrail for stability. Video was good, but the microphone is very susceptible to wind noise. I am going to check into making a foam cover for it. Camera ON time is very quick...3 seconds so you don't miss the shot waiting for the camera to wake up. One \"feature\" I was confused about...I accidentally shot video instead of still, with the camera in the vertical position. So to watch the video, I have to look sideways. Nikon does not supply software to right these images. Windows Moviemaker will do it though. Transfer of the pics to computer works great...but don't do it without using their software if you want to play the images back using the HDMI feature. Camera keeps files of pic info, and if you make any changes to any of the pics, the info files don't match the pics and the camera does not recognize the pics anymore. You can still download via the memory card, you just can't use those cool playback features any more. I imagine that is a software upgrade that Nikon will correct. Overall I am happy with the camera, and look forward to many years' use.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon should be ashamed!", "Author": "C. Russell", "ReviewID": "R1JWH6F0QUMJG1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I've heard nothing but good things about Nikon and I was ready for a new P&S;, as mine is five years old. The Nikon DSLR's may be a favorite of photographers, but their P&S;'s - if this camera is any indication - is severely lacking!I have five-year-old 3MP Fugifilm camera that takes much, much, much better photos than this camera. The additional features, such as \"retouch\" to draw on the screen and add frames is a complete joke. The drawing feature is kind of cute if you like the five colors you have to choose from. The frames are graphics from 1996 era of websites, and on top of that, you only have five to choose from again. The polaroid one is kind of cute. You can also add \"stamps\" of hearts, flowers, stars, etc. They, too, are straight from 'My First Website' circa '96. Juvenile at best.The screen is unresponsive at times. The idea of having a touch screen was wildly appealing to me, but perhaps it's just not a good idea for a camera. I would have to see it to believe it would ever be more than novelty. The screen is also terribly grainy and, once again, worse than my tiny screen on my five-year-old camera.The pictures it took, regardless of scene mode, were ridiculously bad. Grainy, off-color, blurry - just terrible!! I have been wanting a new camera for quite a while, but this camera has made me appreciate how awesome my camera actually is. I did side-by-side comparisons and I feel like it's a waste of time to even type about how absurd the differences were. Like I said, Nikon should be ashamed.It was slow taking pictures, but fast loading.This color is pretty.

I have a Nikon D40 DSLR and it is the best camera I have ever owned.  This camera does a disservice to the quality Nikon (and Nikkor) brand.First of all, the touchscreen is a joke.  It is very inconsistent, and having to use the screen to zoom is a pain in the butt.  It is difficult to delete images (need to go into playback mode, zoom in on them, and then click the trash can).  It is impossible to delete movies from the device, as the software is very buggy.  The graphics look like they came straight out of the 1980s - all white blocky text, and very limited pictograms for the icons.  The terrible UI basically negates any redeeming features this camera might have (VR, HDMI to name a few)As far as picture quality, this thing takes worse pictures than my Motorola RAZR!!  And the RAZR is only 1.2MP!  It takes MUCH worse pictures than an iphone.  Nikon seriously dropped the ball on this one.  EVERY picture I took came out incredibly grainy, and I dont know if its due to the sensor, or the ISO speed, because there is no way to select which ISO you would like to use.  Seriously, pictures from this camera are worthless.  I bought it yesterday with next day shipping so I could have it for the weekend.  After using it for like 10 minutes I decided I am going to return this incredibly sub-par product.

OMG, some of you casual users out there are dead wrong about this camera!  This camera is perfect for anyone looking for a simple, easy to use point and shoot with a large display screen that is compact enough to be \"Johnny on the spot\" when it comes to taking pictures.  There is a VERY SMALL learning curve when it comes to getting used to the interface as almost everything is done through the touch screen interface, which pretty much sums up one of the key features of this camera which some have complained about... this is a touch screen camera.  iPhone users like myself will find it to be a smooth transition, some might find different if anything, but different in a good way once you get used to it.Picture quality is where many of you are destroying this camera and kicking it to the curb.  Wait just one second there before you turn your back on this little gem.  The quality of these pictures, WHEN THE PICTURES ARE TAKEN USING COMMON SENSE, is on par with my SLR camera.  Let me explain in very simple terms for you haters out there, in low light situations, AS WITH ANY CAMERA, you have to consider many variables including whether or not you want to use a flash AND whether or not the subject is moving.  If you are not using a flash and your trying to get that last picture of drunken Timmy as he stumbles around trying to keep his balance and there is absolutely no light... by all means if you are upset about the picture you capture you should probably blame the genius photographer instead of the camera itself.  I'm sure these are the same people that blame the tree for moving out in front of their car.Anyways, the camera takes excellent pictures if you use common sense.  If you take the time to learn the features and scene modes of the camera, you will be just fine.  If a picture or two doesn't appear exactly as you want it, delete it and try again!  Imagine that, we're not working with film here...The video mode of this camera is the only feature that leaves room for improvement, but it still gets the job done.  But guess what shoppers... if you want a digital video recorder you probably shouldn't be purchasing a camera!  Overall, this camera gets 5 stars.  Nikon managed to integrate fantastic picture quality that they are known for into touch screen technology all found in a compact device.  For all the haters, go pick up a Fuji or Kodak that will do all of the \"flawless\" thinking for you.  Those should be simple enough for you to figure out and it'd be cool to have a camera with an equal intelligence level I'm sure.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Innovative, but not first-rate", "Author": "Theatre Geek", "ReviewID": "RFQC7MG3DJ3TR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the sleekness and the design, as well as the large LCD.

Picture quality is horrendous regardless of the environment it's taken in, which is mostly grainy and dark. Adjusting the exposure does not help.  Connecting to my iMac is also a problem.

The Nikon team uses a simple formula to win market share: Pay young, good looking actors and actresses to promote flashy, novel products. This was the case with the Coolpix S60 - a touch screen, in camera editing, a high megapixel count, Ashton....But the \"good stuff ends there.\" I purchased the camera for a friend one year ago against my better judgement. I could tell in the store that the picture quality was very poor. It is among the worst I have even seen. The White Balance is always off; especially indoors. The contrast is poor; even in the best lighting situations images look far to gray. The color reproduction is ok for dark blues, purples and magentas, but poor for blacks, whites, and yellows. Sharpness is ok - consistent with what you would see on most other point and shoots.As with all Nikon cameras (even DSLR's) digital noise (the grainy patches of hot white and errant red and blue pixels) is awful! If you are going to puchase a Nikon point and shoot, purchase noise reduction software too (Neat image is cheap, EASY to use, and can work as a standalone product).Besides picture quality, which is the most important aspect of the camera for me, the navigation is tricky. Switching camera settings (i.e. landscape to portrait) is time consuming. The touch screen navigation is inferior and glicthes often - the touch screen on my Verizon voyager is so much more accurate and responsive.I have to say something positive, otherwise it might appear that I have some strong bias against Nikon (which I do) or point and shoots in general (which isn't 100% true - they can be useful). The fact that the lense doesn't extend from the camera is awesome! You don't miss the extra optical zoom in most cases, and the chance of the lense snapping is gone.All in all, shop around before you make this purchase.

However, because the ISO can be set to 3200 (which most smaller cameras can not!) I did not need to use the flash at all!  I am sure, if you are not willing to increase the ISO, the flash will, as with all cameras, eat through the battery pretty quick.My only complaint so far, and I have had this camera for 3 months, is the location of the zoom.  I feel this was placed a bit low on the screen and takes some true getting used to.  The screen responce can get sluggish, but I have found this to me true when you have a large number of photos on the card.  When flipping through the 400 photos I took, it was pretty sluggish, but when I was flipping through 100 or so, it was just fine.I have also compared my photos with my D200 (I take outdoor photos) and I coudl not tell a difference...and neither could a prof. photographer who I sent my photos to for editing.All if all, this is a great camera!

I have over 5000 pictures and 500 videos of experience with cameras like this. I started with the Sony DSC-T1, then the DSC-T9, and most recently the DSC-T300.They enable you to have a camera/camcorder on your person 24/7. They are not the best at either role, but I have found that one good camera/camcorder in your pocket is way more useful than carrying two bigger devices (a great camera and a great camcorder) - especially when you have left them in your in your car or at home.Perhaps most surprising is that even the video and sound quality on these little cameras was quite good all the way back to the DSC-T1, so I pretty much stopped using a camcorder at that point.I'm sure that others will post more thorough reviews soon, but I wanted to get this info out as soon as possible to help others. For example, it is already enough for me to make my purchase decision, and it answers a key question that I have not been able to find the answer to after weeks of research, which is \"Can it zoom while recording video?\"Based on reviews of previous models of this camera, I had high expectations. I expected high image quality and good low light performance. I was planning to buy it after I verified that it could zoom while recording video.After getting my hands on one and playing with it for about 10 minutes, I did verify that it can zoom while recording video, and although I have not yet been able to test its image quality, I will not be buying one of these.I frequenty switch between video and still photos, and I use zoom extensively. This kind of usage would be very annoying with this camera because both of these features are controlled through the touch screen, which is sluggish, unresponsive, klunky, etc., and thus I would miss many shots. I would not want to have to look forward to this kind of annoyance for the next two years.If the DSC-T500 has good enough image quality, I will buy that instead. It has mechanical controls for video/photo and zoom, and it has trail-blazing 720p HD video with stereo sound. It also records video in Mpeg4, which should be viewable on my iPod Touch. Its predecessor, the DSC-T300, felt like it was built with much higher quality than the S60, and it had very responsive zoom, unfortunately it had poor image quality.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Ex-Nikon Fan", "Author": "K.

The touchscreen is so far behind the technology on my iPhone that it seems like a child's toy.The vibration reduction seems to be non-existent, photos have movement and are just not \"crisp\" at all.The shutter speed is really slow - you have to time things and \"pre-shoot\" in order to capture the image.After trying to see any positives in the camera for a week I returned it.Really, really disappointed.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "The Bad Idea Interface", "Author": "Barton Smith \"smittybart\"", "ReviewID": "RYKKF9OMLFMTE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in a rush on the advice of a local seller.  I told him that I had really liked my Canon SD770 and was looking for something like it.  He talked up the touch interface.  Once I got it home, I realized how much work Apple must have done on the iPhone, because this thing was impossible to use.  If you can't take the picture you want to when you want to, nothing else about the camera matters.  I suspect that much of the trouble could be fixed with a firmware upgrade (I had the original firmware), but even then, what is wrong with having real buttons for zoom?  I don't want to look at the screen to see where the zoom buttons are, and even if you find them, they are often unresponsive.  The large zoom seems to come at the expense of the f# (compared to the Canons) and the pictures were usually noisy.  The menus are not intuitive at all.  I have one good thing to say: the time-lapse movie option is cool.  At the end of the day, I returned it and bought an SD 880, and I am very happy.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Pics", "Author": "F.

It has all the functions that I need and has resolveda lot of issues associated with picture taking for me.  The camera has virtually eliminated blurred, red eyed,eyes closed, no exposure pictures.  The large screen on the back lends to the correct positioning of the subjectyou are shooting. The touch screen makes it easier to select how you want to shoot and review what you have shot.After going through several cameras that have fallen short of the features that this camera has, I think this isa keeper.

And I will never order electronics with Amazon when there is any time sensitivity.The product itself is great. My son can't get enough of it. Takes it wherever he goes and my entire family loves the extraordinary clarity of the pictures. Every photos is crisp, clean, sharp. There really isn't anything to think about. If you want one, get one. If you order it here, buyer beware.My son saved his money and I ordered the Nikon Coolpix S60 from Amazon because it was a good price compared to in-store. He wanted it for all the graduation events coming up for him and thought to save a bit of money. He has regretted it ever since. So have I.When the expected delivery date came and went, he was disappointed. I explained that things happen. I understood, but he had to understand, too, that the expected delivery date was not a guaranteed delivery date. Ok, so he missed one event with his friends: there were many others.Ten days later, having now missed several events, I called Amazon customer service and was assured it would arrive the next day. It didn't. He (and I) missed another irreproducible graduation event. When it didn't arrive as promised, I called customer service a second time. This time I was promised it would arrive next day before noon. It didn't. In fairness, it came that day, but around 6pm.The camera is great. Get it--elsewhere. My complaint is with Amazon. The delivery system needs an overhaul. Customer service was horrendous. When the camera did finally arrive two weeks after the expected delivery date, there was no explanation, no \"all out recovery.\" Sure, they paid over-night shipping, but it wasn't over-night: it was 14 days late!
