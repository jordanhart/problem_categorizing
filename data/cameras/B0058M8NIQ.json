I had a few issues setting up the camera, but found the technical support to be excellent.  They are in Taiwan, so it takes about 24 hours to get a response, but they are very helpful.  So far, so good.  For the price, this appears to be a very good camera.  I anticipate purchasing more of these, and expect the installation will go more smoothly now that I know what to do.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quick delivery and good quality product!", "Author": "Ronald A.
