First of all, I definitely have to say that the pice cannot possibly be beat!  Second, the LCD screen is huge!!  I've boughten myself a few digital cameras over the years, and am more than content with what I've got now.  The picture resolution is amazing, the image stabilization is outstanding!  This camera has so many features, and if you buy brand new, you also get the software and all cables too.  The software in itself is a huge plus because it allows you to touch up your photos, add and take away from your photos and so on.  Basically lets you do the same as Adobe photoshop deluxe lets you do, but without having to pay an additional 50 dollars or more.  I definitely recommend this camera to people of all ages who want a good camera to take excellent quality snapshots.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little Camera", "Author": "Dana A.

I liked how the features were well layed out and easy to use. An overall pretty basic digital camera without all those extra features you probably dont need unless you're a professional photographer. The only things I didnt like about this camera was 1. It goes thru batterys way to fast. So I recommend either buying rechargeable batterys or those expensive longer life batterys. 2. The zoom functions werent very good and sometimes make pictures look grainy.

He has used it on several occasions, including my wedding.  I got to take a few pictures with it also, and it seemed to do a great job.  I was deciding between this camera and the A400 last month, but after checking both of them out, this one is definitely worth the little extra cost (I got it on sale).  My guess is that the A400 is on the way out of the product line, being that the only major differences besides the added megapixels with this camera, is that Fuji has gotten rid of the small viewfinder, which seems to be relatively unused on pocket cameras such as these.  That deletion from the camera gave Fuji more room to make the already large monitor a little bigger.  If your looking for a small-sized camera this seems to be a winner.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Value priced but lacking in quality.", "Author": "R.

The pictures are o.k. at best but for most of the them they were too grainy.  I adjusted all the settings and maximized them for the best picture quality.  The image quality was  not there.  My older Olympus 3.5MP camera produced better images than the A700.Although I read some of the reviews and the overall rating for this camera was low, I was still inclined to pick it up based on the camera specs and the low price.

Martin \"K. Martin\"", "ReviewID": "R289QU8LR24JK7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, I have a FinePix A345 that I've had for over a year now. I wanted to upgrade to another Fuji camera because the pictures I got from my A345 were absolutely marvelous. Under low light, the photos were just untouchable in quality. Granted, focusing in low light can be difficult, and shake is a problem, but still, the photos were fantastic. In fact, I NEVER use the flash on my camera as I never need it unless the subject is backlit. Anyway, I thought the 7.3 Megapixel Fuji would be the answer and I just returned it to the store I bought it from (not Amazon). The pictures were cold, grainy, and just plain terrible. I fear it's because of the new feature they've started putting on their digital cameras where you can chose you ISO setting? I'm an amateur, not a professional photographer, so I really don't understand why you would need film speed setting options on a digital camera.  I tried taking the same types of photos that my A345 took and they just didn't come out. The A700 seemed to compensate for the lack of lighting by making the entire photo dark. Or, if there was some light in the background, the foreground would be black. There was no ambient lighting as there was in my A345. Plus, the photos were just cold and didn't have the warmth of the A345. I was severely dissapointed with this camera. I wanted to stick with Fuji from my prior experience with the A345 and my experience with Canon, Kodak, and Sony gave me results that equaled the terrible ones I got from the A700.  I might try the A470 next.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Nina", "ReviewID": "R3RALLPGA3XSZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my old fujifilm 3 megapixel.

However, in the course of shooting about 200 photos, half with flash, I went through five sets of AA, batteries.  After just about 20 flash shots, the \"low battery\" warning would come on, and after about 30 flash photos, the camera would go \"dead\".However, when I placed those \"dead\" AA batteries in my Fujifilm S5700, THAT camera worked fine.  So, the problem is a defective power management circuit that demands batteries that are at 100% of their full charge to function.  A freshly charged set of rechargeables (charged to about 95% of capacity) lasted just ten shots, yet went on to work fine in the Fujifilm S5700.After \"Googling\" around the internet, I found dozens of complaints about the extremely short battery life of the A700, even from folks who otherwise were reasonably satisfied with its performance.The Finepix A700 took nice photos outside, and good photos with NO flash indoors with the ISO 400 setting in rooms that had sunlight coming through the windows.The flash photos were too washed out if the subject was two feet to four feet from the camera, using the wide-angle setting, and were too dark at six feet to eight feet with the tele-photo.  The WORST flash performance I've seen from any digital camera.Photos of brick wall, taken at five feet at a wide angle setting showed lots of distortion in the corners, with the right side corners being much more distorted than the left side corners.This camera would be acceptable for someone who only shots five or ten photos per month, and never uses the flash.  For that sort of use, the short battery life and poor flash performance would not matter.  But, the photos from a $5 \"throw-a-way\" camera are just as good, for outdoor photos, and a $5 disposible camera would last for a full 40 flash photos, not just 20 or 30.I think the Fujifilm company ought to recall the A700 and give its owners a \"coupon\" they can use to buy one of the many terrific cameras sold by Fujifilm, such as the S700 and the S5700.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great buy!", "Author": "Lindsay M.

However, I will keep the comparison to a minimum. I have deleted most of the references, but a few traces remain.BootupIt turns on quickly, ready to use in 3 seconds.DisplayDisplay runs a lot faster, which consumes the battery faster. There are settings to switch the camera to \"display on photo only\" to conserve battery life.BatteryPowered by AA batteries or rechargable battery packs. It is preferred to use digital quality batteries, or even NIMH batteries, but it can use NiCd or el cheapo batteries. It won't last long with such poor quality batteries, but that's fine if you take less than 10 pictures at a time. There is a setting to drain out NIMH batteries to reduce crystallization (memory effect) which is handy if you don't have a table lamp battery discharger to do the same.GUIGUI has a lot of functions, but is very easy to navigate to switch a setting. It's quite easy to use.StoragePictures are stored in JPG format. Full EXIF info is recorded, with all the details, some you won't care about. The camera uses XD digital media, which is different from the standard SD film format. I worked around this limit by purchasing a MicroSD-to-XD adapter to use with my existing MicroSD media, which I prefer. Storage is really no issue as I am never without my netbook with a cable to offload pictures between shoots. The camera has a floating megapixel processing system, from 0.3 (eBay photos) to 7.3 (keepsake photos or for retouching) Batteries must be in the camera for file management, it is not powered through the USB connection.VideoDon't expect anything good here, it takes cellphone quality videos at 15 frames a second, and at only 60 frames. You have a choice of 320x240 or 160x120 frame size. I am guessing it does not have a streaming encoder, the reason being for taking only 60 seconds of video. I'm keeping my camcorders on hand.SoftwareI cannot review this portion as I bought the camera used, no CD came with the unit. I will not elaborate on what software I am using instead, as each user has their preference. Therefore, I will only list them: Altap Salamander, IrfanViewConnectivityThere is nothing in the camera that enables it to be used as a webcam, nor does it have Bluetooth or Wi-fi.
