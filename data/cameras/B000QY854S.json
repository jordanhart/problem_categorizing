After a couple of tries, we were finally able to download the video to our computer.  It turns out that there is an option on the camera that you have to set to \"disk\" if you have a memory card installed instead of using the camera's internal memory to store photos/video.  Once we changed that option on the camera, we were quickly able to connect the camera to the computer and download our video.  We like the \"burst\" feature on the camera but have been unable to figure out why it only works without the flash activated.  Guess we'll have to keep reading the users manual to figure that one out.  We have not had any problems with the LCD screen freezing and are hoping that was an isolated incident and that we don't have to send our camera back.", "Date": "December 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's Worth Every Penny and It's Idiot Proof!", "Author": "P. A. Wiles", "ReviewID": "RPZA4DVSHUOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!! When I decided to purchase a digital camera, I did all the research and fully intended to buy something else. But this camera caught my eye. It was just the right size, lightweight and great looking. It didn't have all those tricky wheels and knobs that are on so many digital cameras. Honestly, the thought of having to put on my reading glasses to see how to take a picture was a real turn-off on most of the cameras I looked at - but this HP is easy enough to use that I don't need to bother. Besides, with the large touch screen, all of the photo sections and choices are easy to see and even easier to use! Attached to the camera strap is a neat little 'tapper' gizmo - a great alternative to using your finger which can sometimes leave a smear on the screen. This camera was so easy that I learned how to use it before leaving the store!  I bought a 1GB card and get more than 250 photos of great quality. A 2GB cards gives you 500+ photos. It's also a breeze to connect to the computer and with the 'photo tag' feature I can keep all my photos organized right on the camera. I really don't think you can go wrong with this camera because its so easy to use and the picture quality is excellent. Its also an attention-getter with the 'tap' technology.  This was a great buy!", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "HP Photosmart  R937 constantly freezes", "Author": "Ed Moore", "ReviewID": "R2K945YR1QRRAE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera was selected because it looked very user friendly, especially the LED touch-screen.  The first problem was the on/off switch jammed and the camera would not turn off.  I went on  HP live chat and the person could not understand my problem and was instructing me from a manual.  I finally was able to turn off the camera.  The touch screen constantly freezes and I have to turn the camera off, wait, and then restart it and hope that this does not happen again.  It does continue to happen and I am in the process of returning it to HP.

Woodhull", "ReviewID": "R14ZO8Y98H6AIW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for the cool touchscreen--I wanted the biggest LCD I could find, and I really like that part, along with the in-camera editing features.  However, all the editing features don't save this camera from a huge design flaw, which is that they put the flash right over the lens!  The result is that most of the pictures I take using flash have those little white circles in them where the flash bounces off dust particles near the lens.  Most of my flash pictures aren't just poor, they're ruined!  Unfortunately, I take most of my pictures indoors, in low light.  HP Support was no help at all.  I would definitely not buy this camera again.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Really Wanted to Love It", "Author": "MrJDubb", "ReviewID": "RXBXPE8S1S29I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I tell you I really wanted to love this camera.  I think the touch screen and huge LCD are great innovations and make this camera fun and easy to use.  If all you are taking are pictures out on a sunny day, then this IS a great camera.  However, any type of inside shot or low light shots are awful.  A little noise is bearable.  However, there is so much noise in low light pictures using the R937, that even the best editing software can't do much to improve the shots.  Also, in my experience, the pet-eye reduction had no impact at all in shots of our dog.  The red-eye reduction feature on the camera works well, and that is good because you're going to need it!  The placement of the flash immediately above the lens was a design mistake in my opinion, because it washes out many of what would otherwise be a good picture.Again, if this camera is mainly for outdoor shots at the beach, you will be happy with the results.  If not, steer clear and buy something else.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simply Everything", "Author": "D.

But unfortunately it falls way short.  The display appears to be a large, low resolution display that does not show much detail for an 8MP camera.  I think my 3MP Nikon with the 1.8\" display was clearer.Also the pictures from the camera are unusually grainy.  I typically use PhotoShop's sharpen feature before I print my photos, but with this camera a solid-colored background jumps to life.  This is after I adjusted the parameters for the higher resolution.On the positive side, the videos came out great and I like the choice to make some settings permanent or not.

I have owned a few different digital cameras in my day and with each purchase, I tend to look for more features in a more user- friendly package. This HP camera combines the features I had on my last Hewlett- Packard camera with a larger viewing screen and more photo effects for more advanced and more convenient photography.Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera offers many good reasons to rate it highly but among them, the one that caught my attention first was the huge LCD screen. Small viewing screens are a great annoyance with many digital cameras, but the LCD screen on the Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera measures a whopping 3.6 inches. In fact, it encompasses almost the entire back side of the camera and it provided exactly the extra viewing area I wanted. Not only does the large screen make it easy to capture images and clearly see the image you are about to take, it is also perfect for the playback of the video feature. With a screen this large, one can preview a video with ease. There is no need to strain the eyes when the LCD screen on your camera is 3.6 inches.This camera offers many different shooting modes to create just the right picture. Beach, landscape, snow, sunset, etc., are among the many choices and you need to just try each one out to find out which one works best for different situations. I also like the auto- shooting mode. Using this, the Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera becomes idiot proof. It will do its best to conform the image electronically, saving the user the time or hassle of seeking out just the right mode. Picture cleanup is also very fast with the Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera. The large LCD screen makes it easy to find problems and makes it easy to delete the problems with a touch of the screen.Is everything perfect with the Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera? No, there are a few problem areas. One is the lack of available memory. There is enough space on this camera to handle about 20 to 25 pictures. This isn't much at all, and it won't suffice for even the casual picture taker. This is why memory cards are a must with this camera. Another problem is with the zoom function. It doesn't zoom very wide, and it is also one of the few features of the Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera that is not activated by using the touch screen. Another small complaint is the time it takes to transfer pictures from the camera to your pc. The 1.1 USB connection isn't very fast, so you have to be patient as you wait for the pictures to flow from one device to the next.Perfect or near- perfect digital cameras may exist, but they will likely cost a week's wages or more and are not practical for the casual photographer. The Hewlett- Packard Photosmart R937 Digital Camera isn't perfect, but it does take plenty of great pictures, offers great editing, has a long battery life, and offers a gigantic LCD viewing area of 3.6 inches, all for a relatively low price. It's a winning digital camera in my book, giving you the minimum features you want plus a little bit more without the excessively high price tag common with the more sophisticated cameras.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good, easy, point and shoot", "Author": "Bran", "ReviewID": "R3LTWSLEJD30KI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 14 months now.  I carried it around in my jeans pocket for an entire year.  The camera is durable.  I dropped it a few times and have had it bang into all kinds of stuff while in my pocket.  After 12 months the plastic piece that holds the battery broke and the battery would push its door open.  I found that if I bent the door a little (it has a metal hinge) then it wouldn't be forced open by the battery.  I figured that after the wear and tear I put the camera through, that was a reasonable breakage.The one complaint I have is the software for connecting to a PC.  It doesn't really work.  The easiest thing is to not bother with it.  Just pull out the memory card and put it in your computer (or get a usb card reader if your computer doesn't have a built in one).  That will take just a min or two to get all the photos from your camera to the computer.  Then just put the card back in the camera and its good to go.The picture quality is good.  The camera does have trouble in low light if you don't use a flash.  But that is pretty typical of point and shoot camera.  Pictures from this camera seem to have more than average red eye, but that never bothered me.The big selling point for me was the internal lens.  When you focus, it adjusts inside the camera instead of extending out.  This way if the camera gets turned on in your pocket or purse the lens won't get damaged because it stays inside the camera.I also love the touch screen.  All cameras should have a UI like this one.  So much easier to use and figure out.

It takes GREAT quality pictures during the day and there are many modes to choose from like beach, close up, portrait, etc. You can also edit your pictures before you upload it to your computer (make a border around the picture, fix blemishes, make a picture softer, crop, etc). It was my first touch screen gadget and I loved that feature, especially with the BIG display screen. The video feature allows you to zoom in while recording....some cameras don't have that feature.Now on to the drawbacks, it takes bad pictures at night or in low light settings and leaves a bunch of white spots all over your picture. The red eye does not always work. The camera will power off or freeze sometimes. The cover that reveals the lens when you power the camera on or hides the lens when you power the camera off stopped working. Luckily for me, my husband took the camera apart and fixed it. It takes FOREVER to upload pictures from the USB cable and sometimes it took several tries before I could upload all my pics, therefore, I just took the memory card out of the camera, popped it in my laptop, and transferred the pics. It was sooo much faster! The video feature has a very low sound.I've had my camera since 2007 and plan on keeping it to take pics during the day since it does such a great job but I'm going to buy another camera for night/low light pictures.

However, I have had multiple problems and I've now gone through 2 cameras.1)  The cheap plastic thing inside the camera holding the battery in place broke - and then the battery would push the door open and pop out (I held it together with a rubber band).  HP replaced the whole camera when I called this in.  However, the second camera DID THE SAME THING, although fortunately, the door stays closed on the second one.2) Linking with my computer and downloading pictures has never properly worked - with neither camera that I have had.

I can utilize another program to get pictures, but I cannot download any movies that I take.
