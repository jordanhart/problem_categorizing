{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finest body/lens combo in the competition!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R12WDVB7XGSBO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[Following is a reprint of my body only review.  I placed a review of the lens at the end.]The Nikon D80, destined to replace the popular D70 series, is a great camera for Nikon fans who wish to upgrade from their D50s, 70s or 100s. It's also attractive enough to maybe get a few people to jump ship!Here's the highlights:1) 10.2 megapixel. A substantial upgrade from the 6mp of the older cameras, performance should be very comparable to the highly regarded D200 camera;2) 11-point AF system. Similar again to the D200 in performance (though not as easy to change);3) Large viewfinder (.94x magnification). Again, taken from the D200, this is a clear improvement over the previous cameras. Spec wise, this is also better than all the competition, even though other, personal preference factors need to be taken into consideration (such as layout of LCDs and focusing points).;4) 2.5\" LCD. Not only is it larger, it can also be viewed at a much wider angle--particularly handy when locked to a tripod.The camera is small for Nikon (about like the D50), but has a good, firm grip for those with medium to larger hands. Controls are well thought out--easy to get to and use. Dampening of mirror noise is better than its competition.Nikon's use of the SDHC format should be commended. These small cards will have no real disadvantage to the older CF hards once the HC versions start hitting the shelves, and should relieve the danger of \"bent pins\".Things you've liked about previous Nikons have been retained. The D80 uses inexpensive wireless & wired remotes, and it still allows the built-in flash to control other Nikon Speedlights remotely.Compared to the competition, the Canon Rebel XTi & Sony Alpha 100, the Nikon starts a bit in the hole, considering it's the most expensive camera (by $200 & $100, respectively). The XTi offers a nice \"anti-dust\" hardware & software solution; while the Sony offers in camera stablization. Both use the rear LCD for info status. While many may prefer the traditional LCD on top (like the D80), the rear LCD does have the advantage of being considerably larger text for older eyes (and on the Alpha, rotates when you rotate the camera for verticals). Too bad the D80 doesn't give you this option as well.The XTi is smaller and lighter, maybe too small for many people. The XTi also does not offer wireless capability with the built-in flash (like D80/A100). It's battery (hence capacity) is a bit smaller.The Alpha 100 being Sony's first modern digital SLR means that getting lenses and accessories my be a bit more difficult (even though it uses a lot from the older Maxxum cameras). It's also a bit noiser in its operations.The D80 adds more AF selections than either of the above cameras, has nice enhancements like grid lines and double exposures. It also comes with a protective cover for the rear LCD.Lens wise, they greatly outnumber those offered by Sony, particularly in any considered \"Pro\" grade. While Canon can compete in \"Pro\" grade with Nikon (particularly in longer length lenses), Nikon has a bit of advantage in wider angles for digital. Nikon only offers one size digital sensor, where as Canon must offer two series (for 3 different chip sizes).Is the D80 worth the money? For anyone with Nikon lenses, undoubtedly. My recommendation for anyone with Canon EF or Minolta Maxxum lenses: look at those cameras first...but be sure to look at the D80 before you buy.Lens review: Tremendous!  The Nikkor 18-135 gives everybody what they want, an affordable lens with above average quality.First, the 18-135 range is excellent for a kit lens, equivalent of a 27-200 in 35mm photography.  It looks great, zooms smoothly, and balances well.  The Silent Wave focusing motor is quiet, quick and smooth, and allows immediate manual focus (no hunting for switches).  The internal focus is great for anyone using polarizing filters, and allows for a more efficient tulip shaped lens hood (supplied).Second, the image quality is very good. The aperture is of average size, so don't expect images to jump out like large aperture lenses, but quality is good throughout the range.Third, Nikon always includes a better than average 5 year warranty in the US on their lenses.The only negative is that I always prefer a metal lens mount to a plastic one, although the latter keeps both the weight and cost down.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nikon hits this one out of the park", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R1RTYNDP82MANI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since this camera just hit the streets less than 2 weeks ago, I obviously haven't had this for a super long time, but I moved to the D80 as an upgrade from the terrific D50, and the D80 takes care of every single minor nitpick I had with the D50, and then takes it even beyond that. Moreover, since I moved from the D50 and not a D70-series, I was thrilled that the D80 uses Secure Digital (SD) flash cards, which I used for not only my D50, but for my Casio EX-Z750 point and shoot as well.As with the D50, the D80 just feels terrific in my hand. I was concerned initially because the ergonomics of the grip have been ever so slightly modified (more like that of the D70s than the D50), and I really liked the feel of the D50. However, once I got the D80 and actually started using it and shooting with it, the concern evaporated quickly. The D80 is a complete success ergonomically... it feels solid and substantial without being excessively heavy.  Nikon has really always excelled in this niche, which isn't something that shows up in most reviews or on any test charts.  Moreover, the controls are very logically placed, easy to identify and use in real-world photography, and the menus are intuitive and highly functional.This camera is FAST. It's senseless to really even try to quantify it because the numbers (less than 0.1 second to start up) just don't convey how instantaneous shooting with this camera is. There's no discernible shutter lag, and shot-to-shot time is as fast as you need it to be. The D80 can fire up to 3 frames per second, up to 100 JPGs deep. Amazing for a sub-$1,000 camera.The things missing from the D50 that the D80 addresses? Backlit LCD, superimposable gridlines in the finder, depth of field preview, one-button bracketing, bright and large viewfinder, one-touch zooming on picture playback, ISO equivalency down to 100, and a snap-on clear plastic cover for the monitor.As a bonus, some of the in-camera retouching options are fantastic. You can take a color shot, then convert it to B&W; with a red filter (still preserving your original image). You can utilize red-eye reduction (in the uncommon instances when it occurs at all), and Nikon's D-lighting is the digital equivalent of dodging and burning, and I love it.  There is even a color balance shift function which is fun to play with.The autofocusing on the camera is staggeringly fast when coupled with the right lens. (I recommend the Nikon 18-70mm DX lens; I'm not a fan of the kit lenses offered with the D80.  They're very good optically, but the build quality is lacking for my personal tastes.)  Like other Nikon dSLRs, the D80 has an independent AF-assist light (some other cameras rely on the flash unit for this). For AF lenses utilizing the screw-driven focusing mechanism, there is a noticeable increase in focusing speed over the D50. You can also employ an 11-segment dynamic AF grid and select which segment will be used for the point of focus.A word about the pop-up flash: It's brilliant. Rarely does a camera with a built-in flash get it right so often with such consistency. I took numerous flash photos in sometimes varying and difficult lighting situations, and the D80 nailed it every single time.The LCD is the best I've seen to date on any camera. Plenty of cameras have 2.5\" monitors now, but this one has 230,000 pixels and is gorgeously sharp and detailed. You can view it from any angle in a 170-degree arc. Similarly, the viewfinder is a major improvement over both the D50 and the D70 series. Rather than utilizing a cheaper pentamirror like some of the competition, Nikon elects to use a genuine pentaprism which allows the finder to be nice and bright. Additionally, the diopter control knob with detents for each setting is a welcome change from the slider on the D50.Image quality is superb, as one would expect from a 10.2 MP dSLR. I like sharp, vivid pictures, and the D80 delivers. Different processing algorithms can be selected in the menu to yield different degrees of sharpness and saturation.  I haven't had any of my photos from the D80 printed out yet; only viewed them on a 19\" monitor, but they look terrific.  The D80 can also shoot NEF (RAW) files simultaneously with JPGs in one of three compression modes.  Very nice.Battery life is exceptional.  It's fantastic on the D50, even better on the D80.  A six-segment display on the top LCD panel shows you how much life remains, or you can go to the menu and see how many shots have been fired since the battery was recharged, an exact percentage (to 1%) of life remaining, and the battery's \"charge life\" remaining (since any rechargeable battery has a finite number of charge cycles in it).I bought the 2-lens package from Cameta Camera (available through Amazon, though you can call the camera store directly and get the same package for $40 less than Amazon charges).  For my needs, the Tamron 28-80mm lens is, quite frankly, virtually worthless, so it immediately went on eBay, and I bought a new Nikon 18-70mm DX lens in its place (a vastly superior lens).  However, the Tamron 70-300mm Di LD Macro lens that's included is a surprisingly good piece of glass.  I've shot nature and architectural-type photos with the D80 and the Tamron 70-300mm and was very pleasantly surprised at the results.  The lens seems to be quite clear and sharp, it focuses quickly with no \"hunting,\" and the 1:2 macro ratio is terrific.  The short end of the zoom range on the 70-300mm is excellent for portrait work; this is enhanced by the foreshortening effect of the long lens.  Coupled with the excellent Nikon 18-70mm lens, I have essentially the entire range of useful focal lengths covered (although those 12-24mm super wides do make me drool a bit!).  Like many Nikon users, I'd love to have the 18-200mm VR lens, but I'm unwilling to pay a $200-300 premium over its list price simply because it's hard to find anywhere in stock nearly a year after its release.  I'll wait.As for the D80, though, if you have any interest in owning a serious dSLR, buy this camera and don't even think twice about it.  For 2006 and likely for 2007, it's the right choice.  The D80 is highly recommended as the perfect camera for the advanced amateur or enthusiast photographer. It bridges the gap between the D50 and the D200 perfectly. Pair this camera up with a high-quality lens, and a good photographer will have a tool with which stunning images can be made.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "This will be one of the great ones!  A home run by Nikon!", "Author": "Roger J. Buffington", "ReviewID": "R3UN0RBM8GRA03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Obviously, I am enamored with the Nikon D80.  As one who has extensively used the D100, D70s, and D200, I was curious as to how the D80 would \"shake out\" in comparison with these fine cameras.  The answer is that it does very well indeed.The most obvious improvement in D80 over the D70s and D100 is the upgrade from 6.1 to 10.2 Megapixels--the same as its \"Big Brother,\" the D200  This is not a major issue for many users, as a 6.1 MP image (uncropped) looks essentially exactly the same as a 10.2 MP image.  However, if the user intends to crop images in post-processing, the larger amount of resolution becomes important--the more megapixels the more detail when images are cropped.  Shooters of wildlife, for example, will appreciate the additional resolution of the D80, as it is often necessary to photograph wildlife at a distance and then crop the image to cause the subject to dominate the frame.The other very obvious D80 improvements are the larger viewfinder and larger rear-LCD.  These are very welcome improvements, also borrowed from the D200.  The viewfinder is wide, bright, and a literal joy to use.  Combined with the 11-point autofocus system (basically the same as that of the D200 although with some differences in options) the viewfinder makes the D80 a powerhouse camera for moving subjects, or for framing the subject in places other than the center of the image.The autofocus is fast and sure.  I literally never use manual focus with the D80--the autofocus is just too good not to use for almost every conceivable situation.The 2.5 inch rear LCD is bright and vivid--a joy to use.  This too, as mentioned above, is borrowed from the D200.  The menu selections in the D80 closely track those of the D200 and are largely pretty intuitive for anyone who is somewhat familiar with the Nikon system.A few nits.  First of all, the D80 does not have a selection for focus-priority continuous focus mode.  This is unfortunate, as such an option (present on the D200) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus with surety that the subject is, in fact, in focus.  Happily, this absence (which I predict and hope Nikon will correct in a later firmware revision) is not a huge loss.  I have shot hundreds of images of fast-flying birds using continuous focus with the D80 and the images are almost all perfectly focused.  The user can trust the D80 in continuous focus mode, focus priority or no.Nikon chose to equip the D80 with SD cards rather than CF cards.  Why Nikon did this is a mystery to many of us as the D80 clearly is an upgrade to the wonderful D70s, which uses CF cards.  Further, the D80 is a fantastic backup camera for D200 users, and the D200, of course, also uses CF cards rather than SD cards.  CF cards would have been a more logical choice in my opinion for the D80.  Fortunately, the cost of these media is dropping so fast that this is less of an issue than it would have been a few years ago.The D80 sucks up power a lot faster than the D70s.  That 2.5 inch LCD entails higher power use as a price.  Most users will want to own a spare battery.As to ergonomics, the D80 is terrific!  I have just finished an 8 day stay on Maui, Hawaii, during which my D80 was literally always with me.  The weight of the camera is low, and its bulk, reasonable.  There is no digital SLR I would rather carry for an extended period than the compact D80.  The placement of the various controls is excellent, and pretty intuitive.  The quality of the D80 body construction is standard Nikon-Prosumer grade, which is to say, excellent albeit not as heavy-duty as the metal-body D200.Overall, the D80 is destined to become one of the great Nikon cameras that will find a place with users all over the world.", "Date": "November 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best camera for your money, ever", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R12FEY355C0LV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To date, in my opinion this DSLR is by far the best Camera for the money. The image quality is outstanding. I upgrade to the D80 just last week, moving up from my D70s, and I can say that after 10 minuets of shooting, it was worth every penny, in face it should be worth more than its going for. It has the feel of my D70s but better, I always found the D70s to be a little bit too bulky. The D80 is a little smaller, and a lot easier on my hands (I have large hands too), I did however find it to be a little short from top to bottom.  I also purchased the MB-D80 Battery Grip, this fixed my fitment issue. Not only does this allow you to add another battery (Or 6AA which is great for a pinch with two dead Li-ions), vertical shutter release, Aperture, shutter setting scroll knob,and AE-l AF-L Lock button. It also makes the whole camera more steady and a little bit more heavy, which is a good thing, this means less lens blur especially for zoom lens (like the 18-135). Look at the $4,000 Nikon D2X and the D80 with MB-D80 Battery grip side by side, this gives you an idea of the professionalism, simply in the camera size and layout.  Getting back to the D80, This is basically a D200 mini, if you will. Other than the smaller body, and the slightly different auto exposure metering system, you are holding a D200 for $700 less. In short, if you are looking to upgrade from a D50, D70(s) Cannon Rebel Xt, or would like a worthy back up, or even your first DSLR. This is it, a professional grade camera, with easy to use features, and even better all around quality.Its great for anyone really.  Nikkor lens are amazing quality as well, I have always preferred them to Cannon's. If you are thinking about getting the 18-135mm with the D80, I would recommend it. Overall, the lens is sharp and clear, with a great range that does not sacrifice too much considering the range. I would however recommend getting the Nikkor 18-200mm VR over this lens if you can afford the extra money. I have used both(and own the 18-135) and they are both great lenses, but if you are Serious the 18-200 VR will be the only lens you would ever need in that range, the Vibration Reduction (VR) will remove blur for up to four stops higher than what you would normally be able to shoot at.This is great for low light, and considering how great the D80 performs in low light anyways with its built in Noise Reduction and wonderful ISO quality, even at 1600. Its a perfect combination for anyone who is half way serious about pictures. I am a Photography Student, and even my professor is astonished with the resolution and quality.I hope this helps a little bit!", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not Too Old to Learn (Update)", "Author": "Pileated", "ReviewID": "R39ZOQXOCXDOAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I resisted \"going digital\" until now, but my wife got me a D80 for Christmas.  I've worked in photography but for many years it has been a hobby (which I prefer), and I've owned Nikon F2, F3HP, Bronica 6x6, and various 4x5 view cameras.  One thing I've always struggled with in using the highly convenient 35mm SLR format is enlargement capability with such small format images.  Once you've used 4x5 it's hard to settle for the graininess and low resolution of most 35mm films (Kodachrome excepted).  But the 10 megapixel D80 may finally solve this for me.The D80 + 18-135mm ED lens is an amazing package, and I salute Nikon for offering the new digital SLR this way.  The capabilities of the D80 with this lens are impressive--and far beyond my rudimentary digital knowledge at this point.  But learning how it all works is going to be a whole heck of a lot of fun.Most of my reluctance over \"going digital\" evaporated the first time I plugged the D80's USB cord into my computer and watched the images I'd just taken load automatically into Adobe Photoshop Elements.  Literally a few moments later I watched a beautiful slide show of my images--with music to boot--play across the computer screen with incredible clarity and resolution.  Wistful memories of Kodachrome?  Well yes, but I think I'll get over them with this camera.One worry I had as an eyeglass wearer was whether the D80's viewfinder and eyepiece would allow me to see the entire image plus the exposure info while shooting---other digital SLRs I've tried were problematic in this.  But I find the view through the D80 eyepiece is nearly as good as my F3 High Eyepoint body.  This is significant and telling to me, since the D80 is decidedly an amateur camera while the F3 was Nikon's flagship pro SLR in its day.Criticisms: not many at this point.  The camera feels too light to me, but I'm used to the F3/MD3 motor drive combo, which most photographers today would think a punishment to carry and use.  I'm inclined to say that the array of options in programming, exposure adjustment, autofocus, etc. is dizzying to me, and I'm not sure how much of it is really necessary.  But, again, I think it will be fun playing with all the obscure settings.An amazing machine, highly recommended--even for old guys like me.******************Update:  After using the D80 for a month I just purchased the MB-D80 battery pack for it, and my reaction to using this combination is that the basic camera doesn't feel complete to me without the vertical grip and the extension of the standard grip that the battery pack provides.  Granted the MB-D80 adds quite a bit of bulk to the camera, but being used to motor driven F3s and F2s it still feels quite trim and light to me.  It also makes the D80 more like my F3/MD3 in that I can use AA batteries in an emergency.  Great accessory for a very nice camera.", "Date": "December 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Few Nits to Pick", "Author": "Ricardo", "ReviewID": "R1ZH5PJ0DLMJUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With 93 D80 reviews already posted, the world needs another one like it needs higher oil prices. In any event, we all have our opinions so I'll impose mine upon you now.After 30+ years of shooting with Nikon film cameras, I decided to stick with the brand when switching to digital. It was a tossup between the D80 and D200, as either of them would fit my needs.Since my eyesight now requires auto focus, the fact that my manual focus Nikkors will not meter with the D80 but will with the D200 didn't make a difference. That being the case, I saved a few hundred dollars and bought a D80.Cutting to the chase, I am amazed by the image quality. It took a few hundred shots to \"zero in\" on the settings that I prefer, but now it turns out very consistent results.If I'm so satisfied with the D80, how come I only gave it 4 stars? I'm glad that you asked. After 4 months of ownership, I think that I've found some weaknesses that I hope Nikon will address with the D80's replacement.1- Matrix metering, as configured in the D80, is too sensitive to very light or dark areas in the center of the frame. With a dark central area, it's far too easy to blow out the highlights. When they're gone, they're gone. No amount of magic can put back what isn't there to begin with. Sure, you can dial in some exposure compensation, but why should you have to?2- Dear Nikon, Please, Please, Please put a stiffer detent on the door for the SD card. I'm really tired of finding it open in the middle of a shoot. It's only a matter of time until I find that it's snapped off.3- Speaking of detents. An interlock is needed to keep the mode dial where it's placed. It's far too easy to wind up in some idiot mode instead of remaining in aperture priority. Nothing is worse than having the flash pop up and fire because the dial slipped.4- While not exclusive to the D80, Nikon is the only manufacturer that does not include a fully-featured RAW converter in its software package. What's up with that? RAW is all that many advanced amateurs and pros shoot, so why isn't a converter included? It wasn't a deal breaker for me, but I felt like my pocket was being picked.Anyway, it's all about the images and those that come out of the D80 are as good as I've ever seen from a camera in this class. When I look at the 16X20 prints on my walls I'm almost ready to give Nikon that extra star. Almost, but not quite.Enough with reading reviews.....go to your local camera store (if you still have one) and wrap your hands around the cameras you're considering. Trust me, you could be out there shooting instead of wasting so much time reading reviews. :-)", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Film to Digital at last!", "Author": "R. P. Poletti \"Just a guy\"", "ReviewID": "RXDF1HSCWEXM6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally did it.  I have made the transition from film to digital photography.I LOVE this camera!  Definitely a great addition to the venerable Nikon line of SLRs.  It is right-sized, easy to handle, fast and quiet.  There is a good deal of automation built for those times when you are more need to get a shot NOW, yet the fine control to enhance your creativity.Since this is my first digital camera of any type, I cannot compare it to other digital models; I can only compare it to film cameras.D-80 and Digital Advantages---------------------------Low processing costs.  Only pay for the \"keepers\" you print.\"Throw away\" and test shots no longer carry a penalty of any kind.Huge picture capacity with large SD cards.  No more changing film rolls at the most inopportune moment.Instant feedback.The D80 has a high enough resolution to make good sized prints.All the digital processing advantages, (white balance, cropping, converting to black-and-white or sepia tone, etc.)Auto ISO and the ability to change ISO for any given shot.The many exposure modes give you flexibility and fine control.  The modes vary from point-and-shoot, to manual.  There are also vari-program modes that automate many common shooting or difficult situations like night portraits where you want to flash the foreground but also want a long exposure to get the darker background.  Or high-speed modes where you may need the AF system to track a moving object as it passes across the field of view.Compatible with the full range of 35mm lenses, speedlights and accessories.  So if you are like me and have a significant investment in 35mm Nikon gear, this is the way to go.  Do not get rid of that 35mm body!  (Using DX-type lenses on a 35mm body is not recommended!)Smaller focus area (compared to 35mm) means less shutter travel.  That translates into much faster flash sync speeds and less vibration.The D80, when combined with Silent-Wave Motor lenses has a very fast focus which is nearly noiseless.The Auto-focus system is one of the most intelligent I have ever used, yet you have extremely fine control over it.  Very flexible.Setting the built-in flash to Commander Mode permits you to control several off-camera CLS compatible speedlights *wirelessly* (SB-800, SB-600 and SB-200).  You can also turn off the built-in flash so that it will not fire during exposure (avoiding the harsh face-on light).  It will still generate the monitor pre-flashes to fire the other speedlights.  You can also use a shoe-mounted speedlight to be the commander as well.  There are a couple of channels and groups so that you can avoid stepping on another photographer in competitive shooting situations.I love the rear-curtain flash sync!  I will not buy a body or flash that will not support it!There are so many other options and capabilities with the flash, such as multiple flashes during a single exposure, that really give you tremendous creative control.Digital and D80 Cons--------------------Not too many cons, but they can be show-stoppers for some.Film has a much higher resolution, so if you want to make poster-sized prints, you will still need that film body.Limited ISO range.  The slowest ISO for the D80 is 100, common in other DSLRs too.  I often shoot ISO 25, 50 or 64 for the express purpose of getting very slow shutter speeds to blend motion, such as running water.  Even with these, I would often use neutral density filters to get exposures of several seconds.  Now I need to use more ND filters to stop down.The battery does not last as long as a 35mm battery, more than 1,000 shot w/o flash, but it recharges quickly and you can always carry a spare.  If you are used to camera batteries lasting for weeks or months, you will not get that here, but then.While the D80 has a very solid feel, it have a feeling that it is somehow more prone to shock and vibration damage than 35mm counterparts.  Note!  This is speculation on my part!Other Points------------Remember that there is approximately a 1.5x effective focal length ratio when compared to a digital camera.  So that 18-135mm DX lens actually equates to a 27-202mm lens on a 35mm.  a 24-120 lens would be 36-180.  If you like wide angle, you may need to pick up another lens.  If you like telephoto, you are in luck.Recommended Accessories-----------------------I recommend the SanDisk Extreme III SanDisk 2 GB Extreme III SD Memory Card ( SDSDX3-2048-901 ) line of SD cards, the bigger the better.  These are very fast and can *exceed* the Nikon product claim of 100 continuous shots, at 3 per second, when not using RAW mode, even when image size is Large!  It also comes with special \"undelete\" software to recover deleted images.  I am happy with the Ultra II line but they cannot quite keep up with lots of continuous shooting and they do not have the undelete utility.The optional MB-D80 Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack for the Nikon D80 Digital SLR Camera battery pack uses two batteries (discharging them one at a time!) to power the camera.  You can also use AA batteries in it to drive your camera in a pinch.  While it adds weight, it makes vertical shooting easier as it has a shutter release (which can be disabled) and command and sub-command dials.  I recommend this accessory.Do you travel?  Consider the Adorama QP-104 Rapid Battery Charger.  Adorama QP-104 Rapid Li-ion Battery Charger for Nikon EN-EL3 Battery, 110-220V, 12V Car Cord Adapter Included  It has a car adapter so you can recharge your camera battery while you are on the road.  The A/C adapter is compatible with both North American and European power standards (you still need the plug converters, however).Consider the getting the D80 body separately and the Nikon 12-24mm f/4G ED IF Autofocus DX Nikkor Zoom Lens zoom and the 18-200 VR DX Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lenszoom instead of the 18-135mm kit.  But only if you are a fan of zoom lenses.  I have yet to use a zoom that came anywhere near the quality of a prime focus lens.  Not to mention zooms are almost always a stop or two slower.I really like to SB-800 Nikon SB-800 AF Speedlight for Nikon D50, D70s, D80, and D200 Digital SLR Cameras speedlight.  High guide number 38/125, auto-zoom 24-105mm and, of course, the amazing Nikon wireless CLS are great!  Get a couple or three if you do any indoor work!  Do not forget about sync cords Nikon SC 29 - Flash synchro cable - flash terminal if you want to use a pistol grip.The ML-L3 wireless remote is useful only if you standing in front of the camera.

With the dozens of pieces of Nikon gear I have purchased over the years, this was the very first failure I ever had.  I contacted Nikon support, which was easy and fast (the never put me on hold).  I sent the camera to the service center and got it back 10 days later.  I was pleased with the the service and repair, but disappointed the the camera broke to begin with.  Still, I am considering getting another D80 so I can have a second body.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Which Nikon 10.2MP Camera to Buy?", "Author": "FredM", "ReviewID": "R25DTHS4AYKSW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nikon has muddied the waters about, and now offers no less than three digital SLR cameras that use the same basic imager -- the D200, D80, and D40x. Which should you buy?This D80 is smack in the middle, and packaged with a useful lens that's also middle-of-the road in its applications.  Appropriately, the D80 may be the best choice for those who have graduated from the point-and-shoot/snapshooting phase, but aren't ready for a more semi-pro camera.D40x -- Uses the same 10.2MP sensor, but is smaller than the D80.  It produces similar image quality, but has the limitation of providing autofocus only with AF-S and AF-I lenses (or other lenses from third-party vendors that have autofocus motors built-in.) If you own an existing complement of lenses that aren't compatible, you'll want to pass on this camera.D200 -- Larger than the D80, it has more water-resistent sealing, and uses a four-channel readout from the sensor, so it's capable of 5 fps bursts in continuous shooting mode.  The D200 is much more customizable, has shooting banks to store sets of settings, and will provide metering in both M and Aperture-priority modes with older, non-\"cpu\"-equipped manual focus lenses. This camera might be your choice if you're shooting a lot of sports, have older lenses, and want to be able to customize your settings.  The D200 uses Compact Flash cards rather than the SD cards used by the D80 and D40x.D80 -- This camera has many of the features of the D200 in a smaller package, but with a slower 3 fps burst rate.  It's a camera you won't easily grow out of, is simple to use, and provides excellent image quality.  It makes an excellent \"first\" D-SLR.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "A camera for the transition to pro levels", "Author": "Tom Iancu \"from east\"", "ReviewID": "R925A8RPASNF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK. One year passed since I've bought this camera so I can get into a review of my personal experience with it.First of all, if you consider into buying this model, you should know that this is not a dSLR that you can use on auto settings and get fabulous results. Get a point and shoot for that or a D40/ D40x. D80 seems to be tuned to provide best results with manual modes or semi-auto modes (fixed-aperture or fixed-shutter). I spent almost 1,000 shots until I got used with the behaviour of D80 in different light conditions and with different camera settings. The learning curve may vary, but definitely won't be a steep one.EXPOSURE: the matrix metering mode is thought to overexpose but, IMO, those that said that use this mode in the wrong situations: high-contrast, high-dynamic scenes which require careful analysis of the zones (with spot metering and/ or center-weighted) and exposure settings should be chosen accordingly. Matrix is fabulous for shooting scenes with the sun to your back, overcast or uniform lighting: exposure is perfect. For all other situation I would highly recommend spot metering.FOCUS: focus is always dependent on the lens you use. If you invest in this DX body, get a good (pro) lens to suit your needs. The 17-55DX (Click here: Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX Nikkor Zoom Lens) from Nikon is a fast-focus, super-sharp lens that allows you to take shots using all capabilities of the D80 AF system. However, there are some cheaper lens I would recommend, one of them is the 50mm f/1.8  prime (Click here: Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras), super cheap bargain for the quality you get. The new 55-200VR (Click here: Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom Nikkor Lens + Hoya 52mm UV Haze Protector Glass Filter + CapKeeper Lens Cap Strap + 6-Piece Cleaning Kit - for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras including Nikon D40, D40x, D50, D70, D70s, D80, D100, D200 & D300) is also a bargain but don't expect to get similar sharpness as from the 17-55DX. Overall focus is very fast WITH a fast-focusing lens but will require some learning from you especially if you'll use single point focus so some recomposing technique should also be learned.COLORS: You'll be ABSOLUTELY AMAZED by the colors this camera will provide you considering that you nailed the exposure and set correct camera settings. Skin tones are natural, vivid and well balanced, blues are deep, reds are explosive, greens are smoothly rendered. But please take tests on all three color modes (two sRGB modes, I and III and one Adobe RGB mode, II) and see which suites you best. If you intend RAW, go for Adobe RGB; for JPEGS use I or III sRGB modes. You should be aware, though, that deep reds tend to overexpose on I and, especially mode III, so either compensate exposure, either go for RAW and mode II. Overall, colors are marvelous and you'll get amazing results once you'll learn how to master the camera.Please get yourself two rechargeable batts. One is not enough if you intend to shoot all day. Another option would be to buy the grip, the MB-D80 (Click here: Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack for the Nikon D80 Digital SLR Camera), that allows you to stick 6 AA batteries or two EN-EL (Click here: Nikon EN-EL3e Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for D200 Digital SLR Camera) rechargeable. With 2 nikon rechargeable batteries the autonomy is VASTLY improved.HIGH ISO: From my experience, the limit of all-around ISO setting is 1250 for best-detailed photos. However, as you'll learn to better expose ISO 1600 is perfectly usable and ISO 3200 for Black and White or small-sized photos (4x6\"). Please remember that higher you get with the ISO, more important is to nail the exposure in order to minimize the noise. In-camera high-ISO noise reduction does marvels IF you'll shoot JPEGs, but please don't use it if you go RAW: you'll loose details.The camera body is made for middle-sized hands. For bigger hands, the D200 body is more suitable. Most important, for example, is the distance to the buttons than can be reached with the right thumb (the AE/AF-L and the multiple selector). But the controls operate smoothly and you can do a lot of customizing to fit your needs.Overall, this is an excellent camera and don't get fooled by reviews that point to poor image quality. Almost all cases of poor image quality come from improper use and not enough testing of this camera capabilities. My first results were awful, but after a couple of weeks of continuous learning I started to get amazing results. I'm suggesting 5 topics you SHOULD learn/ cover before or simultaneous with using this camera:1. Basic controls: aperture, shutter speed, ISO and how they interact;2. Relationship between aperture and depth of field;3. Ansel Adams zone theory; very educative4. Color temperature and color temperature correction5. RAW files processingAbout #5 above, please get yourself good RAW processing software. I use, for my workflow, Nikon's Capture NX (Click here: Nikon Capture NX Software for Windows and Mac) and Adobe Photoshop (Click here: Adobe Photoshop CS2): I squeeze most of image from Capture NX, save it as TIFF and make final adjustments in Photoshop.Good luck, D80 is worth each penny I spent on it.And no, I'm not on Nikon's payroll. ;)Update: October 29, 2007: 17-55DX on a D80------------------------------------------I have just purchased a Nikkor 17-55DX lens and there are some things I would like to share with this D80 review.First of all, the lens is awesome ! It is extremely sharp even down to f2.8 but what amazes me it is its ability to deliver microcontrast which give images a very natural look. Details are better rendered than with any other regular lenses I own. However, there are some things you should be aware of when using this lens with the D80:1. First of all, this is a VERY contrast lens. Whenever you'll shoot in harsh lighting conditions (as directly under mid-day sun), the images tend to loose details in the extremes (highlights and shadows); you'll manage to control that using lower tone settings in the image menu of the D80, maybe -1 or, better, -2. This is VERY important if you shoot jpeg, and advisable for NEFs.2. For me it seems that the lens is balanced for neutral light, kind you'll get in a studio with controlled lighting. Under direct sun on my D80 it has a slight magenta cast in shadows, easily correctable with postprocessing (pp); overall, images you take with this lens and a D80 are very well controlled and don't require pp.3. the lens IS heavy, my D80 + MBD80 (grip) + 17-55DX is quite a boulder so you probably take that into consideration when looking for the 17-55DX;That's all for now", "Date": "September 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "I finally found my Digital SLR", "Author": "Raja Bhat \"Raja\"", "ReviewID": "R1QFWS736X2DYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking at Digital SLRs ever since Canon came out with its 10D. Since then, there have been so many by so many companies. I've always been a Canon user. I have had 2 EOS bodies-the Elan IIE and the 7E. And also the Canon IX, its APS camera which I still have (its small viewfinder was a major disappointment).Anyhow the 30D came along, and its viewfinder was small too. The camera was still too large for me, and I just wasn't sold. Now the Nikon D80. It is narrower than the Canon 30D, and what is breathtaking is the panoramically big viewfinder. Such a delight to use. The 2.5\" LCD seems to fit perfectly in the back: nothing bigger or smaller would be right.The pictures are fabulous. I bought a 2 GB Sandisk Ultra II card, which I thought would be fast. It takes about a half second for the picture to come on the LCD, but I'm not complaining. 2 GB is a big card. It can hold 500 photos using the Normal JPEG, large image. I'm sure the 1 GB would be faster. On the Canons, the onboard flashes never would use the advanced metering that the external flashes provided, but with the Nikon D80, I see such perfectly illuminated photos with the onboard flash.The 18-135 lens is something I jumped for. 28-200 in 35 mm size is quite a huge range, and yet the lens is not massive. I thought hard about the Image stablization you could get with the Canon 18-85 IS lens, but naaah, the 30D just does not measure up so I dropped that idea. There are always such things called tripods!! The entire camera, lens and battery feel just right, and not too heavy. The lens is excellent. The kit fits nicely into a relatively small Lowepro bag.This truly has been a camera worth waiting years for. 12 or 14 MP models are sure to come along in a couple of years, but I doubt that they can make the bodies any more compact; the file size is large enough as it is with 10 mega-pixel. The D80 is so perfect in shape I doubt Nikon can do much better.

The pictures have been just incredible.  The focus, metering, exposure, flash, color balance...  Everything is perfect so far.I have mainly used the camera in full automatic mode and it really shines.  Its as simple as a point and shoot in this mode.  I have used the camera in difficult lighting situations and the photos have been incredible.  There is no noticeable shutter lag, which is very important to me.  I have a 6 yo son who goes from smiling one moment to looking away the next.  I have missed so many photos in the past due to shutter lag, but that is not a problem with this camera.  Another feature that helps is the continuous mode.  I can take 3 pics a second for up to 100 pics and then select the best.  Generally I find I can get a good pic in like 10-15 photos.I used to be a serious photo hobbist during the days of film, but always had problems finding a darkroom to develop my film.  The darkroom issue and the shear cost of film and paying for processing made me abandon the hobby.  But this camera is really bringing back the excitement of this hobby again without the trials and expense of the darkroom.The only downside in this camera is the price, but in this instance, you get what you pay for.  You might be able to save a buck or two with another camera, but I wouldn't even try.  I can't imagine a camera taking a better picture.By the way, I love this lens.  The 18 to 55 mm focal length is a nice every day lens.  Its much wider angle then you find on the point and shoot cameras, yet you can still get close.  I have a 55-200 mm lens as well, but I find I use the 18-55 lens more.  The shorter lens is great in confined spaces, where you can't easily back away from the subject, and its always better to move closer to your subject than use a long lens (unless you can't for safety reasons).My only regret is waiting so long to get a DSLR camera of this quality.

My experience with the image performance of the D80 reveals that: Pros of this camera (most important in my opinions):1. Nearly instant start up.2. 10.2 MP sensor offering better possibilities when it comes to cropping3. Prism viewfinder with grids4. Excellent usability5. Most default settings are very reliable6. Bright LCD monitor on the back7. It is small and light enough so that the middle finger of my right hand don't hurt after 200 shots in an afternoon without a tripod. Highly recommended to anyone has small hands like mine.and on and on...Cons:1. Metering. The D80 has a very strong tendency of over exposing and its over exposing behaviour is not consistent. I was constantly turning the exposure compensation up and down between 0 EV and -2 (!!!) EV when doing landscape or street shots. On D80 it is very easy to adjust the compensation but still you need at least 10 seconds to press the +/- button, test shoot, looking at the monitor, if not right, execute the action loop again....it has been very frustrating to me sometimes. During a time-critical shooting like a sudden event on the street, the need of twiddling the exposure compensation all the time might make you miss the most interesting moment. And since the memory capacity is always limited no matter how high it is, doing bracketing or shooting raw all the time is  not really practical. I really really really wish Nikon could fix this problem in the next version of the firmware for D80.2. The diffraction is easily visible when the aperture is smaller than f/13. However for \"tact sharp\" landscape shoots, f/22+ is usually desirable.These are the only two things which have been bothered me. I would like to give it a 4.5 star, rounded to 5.When I am on the run, I use the automatic/default setting a lot. The most impressive automatic setting on the D80 is \"night scene (landscape)\" mode. The over exposure in daytime might be a failure of D80, but it turned out such a nice feature at night. All my night shots using the automatic night mode look brilliant and vivid. D80 not only outperforms other DSLRs on the automatic night scene (landscape) mode, but also beats my manual settings most of the time when shooting city lights.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Perfection", "Author": "captain video", "ReviewID": "R3OG9DITATSFH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D80 is an excellent camera. How infrequent a product thrills so much after buying it. Bra-frakking-vo Nikon!I have been taking photographs all my life and wanted a top quality near-pro digital SLR. I considered the D200, but liked that the D80 shares the most critical features and core imaging system with the D200 *and* adds in the automatic features for when I want to shoot more rapid spontaneous shots. It really is the best of both worlds.I have used this for a month now and only found a few flaws.Pros:-too numerous to mention. -Battery life is incredible-Color capture is terrific-Sharpness of image terrific-Speed of the system to turn on and be ready to capture is lightning fast-3 shots per second capability. Not the 5 fps of the D200, but c'mon, I am not a war photojournalist. 3fps is fine for me.Cons-First, when using the onboard built in flash, its default setting is for TTL-BL, meaning that it tries to match the overall scene-results in some underexposure that needs correcting in photoshop.-The only other flaw I can find is the availability of some Nikon components. I wanted to add a SB600 flash, this took a few weeks to find in stock. The same is true of some of the Nikon lenses. THis seems to be a problem of Nikon being too popular or a messed up manufacturing system back at HQ. Actually to put on my cynical hat for a moment, my suspicion is that Nikon is restricting some of their new VR lenses to kit lenses for the D200 to keep it from being completely cannibalized by the awesome D80.You will not regret buying this awesome camera.As far as D80 vs D200, here is my advice. Go with D80. You cannot hand the D200 to a non-pro and expect them to take decent photos with it, but with the D80 you really could set it to auto and anyone can take great shots. Also, the optics and performance will rival the D200 for much less price. Better to spend the difference in filters and lenses. Bottom line is, D200 is heavier and has less ease of use features.

The 11-area autofocus system makes a HUGE difference, at least to me, and enables much better control and less wasted time trying to focus how I want to than the Rebel XT. Looks and feels serious and solid, like it means business. far more features and controls than the Rebel XT (which does make it harder to use, however) much quieter focusing and shooting. Excellent low light exposure, far better than the XT (using their respective kit lenses). Colors seem more rich and vibrant than the XT, and bright colors seem to \"pop\" more. This kit lens is of FAR better quality than the horrible kit lens that came with the Rebel XT. This kit lens does not live up to the usual kit lens reputation. It far exceeds it.Cons: price (still near impossible to find one of these for a steal), weight (it feels solid and well constructed, but you pay for that with the weight. my hand never got tired with the Rebel XT, it gets tired with this. I don't mind it though because I know it is more solidly built), seems to underexpose outdoors, but the detail and colors seem richer. (I'm sure once I get more familiar with the controls I will be able to tweak this), uses SD cards instead of CF. While the kit lens is far better than the Rebel XT kit lens, it does show more of a pincushion effect than the kit lens of the Rebel XT.Now, I realize that to be fair the D80 should be compared side by side to the Rebel XTi, not the Rebel XT, but again I don't have the experience to do that. I can only speak from my own personal experience based on what I have owned and used.Bottom line, to me this seems like a great midway point between entry-level DSLR and true professional DSLR. It seems to straddle the two ends of that spectrum very nicely in terms of picture quality, price, controls, and features. I can tell that this camera is going to make me a better photographer.I am still very happy that I started out with the Rebel XT, however, and if a friend of mine asked me for advice on buying their first DSLR I would probably recommend the Digital Rebel XT because it is so easy to use. I mean the Rebel is basically a glorified point and shoot camera with a mechanical shutter, ability to change lenses, and much better picture quality. Please pardon my slight hyperbole there, but hopefully you get the point. The Rebel XT takes zero know-how to use. For a beginner this is perfect if you ask me. Someone who knows how to use a point and shoot will quickly be able to master the Rebel XT.The D80 takes much more know-how to use but so far as I can tell that is a good thing if you are serious about photography.

I have been shooting cameras one way or another now for a living for nearly 15 years. I remember the days when we all dreamed of digital cameras and once we had them we dreamed of days like these! First let me say that I come from the uniqe perspective of having shot and worked on nearly every barnd and type of camera available at one time or another! So I have no Brand loyalty to speak of! I'm loyal to my pictures not cameras.At the time of writing this my D80 is on the way to me, I am making these remarks based on some tests I ran using a D80 and my D200.I have to say right off that the D200 is just about the closest thing to the perfect digital SLR I have ever found, that is until I got hold of the D80, now there are 2!Sensor wise both cameras are identical as is shot to shot and start up time. The D200 is faster (5FPS) and has a bit more image control by way of the ability to change sharpness levels, contrast, and saturation. On this note the D80 simplfies the process with giving you the ability to photoshop your images within the camera. ( I really liked that!) You can bring out detail in shadows, add filter effects, the list goes on and on. But the important thing is the ability to change all the other aspects like in the D200 are there as well, making this one hell of a versitile camera. ISO performance is on par with Cannons 20 or 30D (Sorry Cannon)and quite frankly shuts the XT down all together. ( I used to use both these cameras so take my word for it!)I don't know about the XTi. ISO noise is controlled by Nikon in a different manner than Cannon, and wich method you will like better will depend on you. I feel that Nikon images clean up easier with better results, and thier software is better. Both cameras are built extremely well, The D80 is built to last as long as you can when treated right, the D200 however lets you hammer nails all day and take pictures till dawn. At 1/500 flash sync is slower on the D80 but unless you know what that is don't worry about it, even then its no big deal. The other downside...SD cards...but I love the camera so I'll just have to get over it. And, the battery life is much better than the D200, (Speed needs juice folks)Low light photos are better with the D200, mainly because of a little better setting control, shot to shot both cameras perform about the same. The LCD and view finder are the same as the D200 and are both clear and bright as well as a joy to work with. The control layout is placed perfectly so much so that once you learn your way around you will find yourself changing things without looking!I love Sigma lenses and both Nikons work like a charm with all my glass, in fact the response on both was so good I was able to shoot hand held with a Sigma 50-500mm at ISO 400 in the late afternoon. And both cameras nailed each picture tack sharp! Cannons do not work well with any lenses other than Cannons.. Trust me!! I will write more in depth once my camera arrives. Then I can really get into it and see what makes it tick. But let me leave you with this thought...In my opinion Olympus, Pentax, Samsung, Pannasonic, Sony, and now Cannon are all in what I call the gimmick camera business ( another Sony Invention) Relying on gimmicks rather than improving the basic function of the product. They all are guilty save Nikon who has maintained it level of performance and even improved upon it. In ALL respected circles the D200 is considered to be the finest camera available under $2000...it is. The D80 is the finest camera for $1000 and under. Like I said I have no brand loyalty, if Cannon or even Maytag could deliver a camera that could beat this I'd switch in a heartbeat, but I can tell you folks they have a long, long, way to go. Nikon just took it out a whole new door! I'll let you know when I have more.

The D80 seems to be the best option for those considering weight and contemplating an upgrade or first time investment in a digital SLR from Nikon.

I highly suggest you get a DVD on how to use the camera. . . even if you already know a lot. It is great to sit down and go through the features to familiarize yourself with the camera -- visually on DVD where you can stop and review with camera in hand rather than reading a manual that doesn't give you the same type of introduction.

I had an 85mm lens (I previously shot with a 50mm) so I thought maybe it was a focal length/shutter speed issue.

There are positives and there are substantial negatives as well.My advice is that if you get a copy with ANY problems, return it immediately and get a new copy.  Don't try to deal with Nikon repair.  Also, as I noted below, you may want to look at the Canon 40D or wait for the Nikon D300.Nikon seems to have a problem with manufacturing and repair quality control.  In the very, very short life of my first copy, it went through major repairs and servicing twice, and needed repairs a third time before I got rid of it.  Nikon still would not provide me with a new copy. I had to buy a new one. Although Nikon Technical Support is first rate (the guys who pick up the phone and answer technical questions), their warranty repair leaves a lot to be desired (the guys who actually fix the cameras).My review below is NOT based on the repair problems I experienced, but rather on the normal operation of the camera.1. Auto-focus. In good light, with a subject that has good definition, the camera focuses very well.  However, in dimmer light (such as indoors or at night) or when focusing on a subject without sharp contrast (such as focusing on clouds, on a wall, etc), the camera is unable to focus without constant hunting.  This is endemic with all auto-focus cameras to some extent; however, on the D80, it's pronounced.  My Nikon Coolpix 3100 auto-focuses better than the D80 (in a side-by-side comparison, the Coolpix out-performed the D80 every time in terms of ability to focus on a subject and speed).2. Sharpness. My copy produced slightly soft photos.  I noticed this when I saw results from a D40x that were much sharper.  This can be helped in Picture Project, but it is much better to start with a sharp image than use software sharpening.  I have heard from others that their images were soft was well.  Focus issues also were noted by another reviewer (which may produce soft images).3. Noise in Low Light. I am impressed by the lack of noise in good light at ISO 100 and 400.  Usable photos are produced even up to ISO 1600 in good light.  However, in low light or at night, there's a lot of noise for long exposure shots.  Long exposure noise reduction (in camera) seems to help with the long exposure night shots (30 seconds +), but noise reduction by its nature reduces picture sharpness.4. Included Software. The camera comes with Picture Project, a basic software program that can adjust red-eye, brightness, sharpness, and convert NEF (Nikon RAW) to JPG.  However, the more robust software, Capture NX is $99 extra.  The extra software is needed to correct things, such as distortion and rotation in photos using wide angle lenses.  It should be included.  I bought (and recommend) Adobe Photoshop instead.5. ISO Adjustment. In order to adjust the ISO, you need to navigate through the menu.  The camera should have a manual ISO adjustment, so that ISO can be changed quickly.6.  No dust management for the sensor.  At some point in time, your camera will get dust on the sensor, regardless of brand.  This will result in spots (sometimes large) appearing in your images.  Removing the dust from your sensor can be a big issue if the camera does not have a dust-off system.  Without the dust-off, you will need to lock up your mirror and use a sensor wipe in a dust-free, breeze-free environment.  Otherwise, you will get more dust on the sensor.  The D80 does NOT have a dust-off system.  Not only does it not have a system, my first copy had an excessive amount of dust in the body, due to sloppy manufacturering/repair by Nikon.7.  Take a look at the Canon 40D and Nikon D300 (when available).  I had the opportunity to look at images from a friend's Canon 40D.  They are noticably sharper than those produced by the D80.  However, the 40D will be more expense than the D80 (+ $400) for at least several years.  Additionally, if you are a Nikon fan or have an existing investment in Nikon lenses, you may want to wait for the D300 (which corrects some of the issues I noted above).  In fact, had the D300 been available when I needed to replace my first D80, I probably would have bought that instead.  The D80 is a decent camera, but these issues with it are annoying and the D300 is more moisture resistant.  However, by the time the D300 comes out, it probably will be about $1000 more than the D80.8.  No prime lenses for street photography.  There are no high speed (f/1.4 - 1.8) prime lenses in the 50mm equivalent focal length available*.  This would mean a fixed focal length of 28 or 35mm (the equivalent field of view of a 50mm lens for a 35mm film camera).  Several slow speed zooms (f/3.5) and higher speed zooms (f/2.8) are available in this focal length, but the only current manufacture fixed focal close to this niche is the 35mm f/2.0.  The 50mm f/1.4 and f/1.8 also are available, but these are not 50mm equivalent after the APS-C conversion (making these lenses 75mm equivalents). Why is this important?  High speed 28mm and 35mm lenses with f/1.4 or f/1.8 are the main-stay of street photography.  All others (f/2.0+) are unusable due to available light limitations as the sun sets and indoors.*note that a Nikon brand 28mm f/1.4 is available, but not in current production.  These sell used in good condition for $2500 as of today.  A Sigma 30mm f/1.4 also is available.  However, in my opinion, due to auto-focus issues experienced by me and well-reported by numerous other people, these lenses are unusable.9.  Seals are light.  This camera is not well-sealed.  If you live in an environment with weather, you probably want a better sealed camera, such as the D200.  I live near the ocean and notice problems regularly when there is humidity in the air.10. Smaller 8.5MP Fize Size.  Although the RAW, large file size in the specs is noted as 10.1MP, the file size of the RAW files does not exceed 8.5MP.  I not sure of all of the implications, but Nikon technical support does not know what this means either.11.  Dead pixels.  The copies I have seen (including each copy I received from Nikon) have hot (bad) pixels on the LCD screen.  Don't accept any bad pixels.Nevertheless, the camera is light-weight, and there are a variety of lenses and accessories to match the camera.  Operation of the camera is relatively easy, although I needed to read the manual and the quick-start guide to understand the menu and gain access to all the features.My batteries seem to last about 400 - 500 shots (RAW + JPG Basic, VR on intermittently, moderate use of LCD screen), so I highly recommend a spare.  Nikon's own battery tests indicate a charge holds for 600 - 700 shots, but none of these tests were performed using RAW format (Nikon used JPG Basic and Normal for the test).I live in a city that is windy, and the lenses with Vibration Reduction (VR) work like a charm.  I would recommend VR enabled lenses, especially in the telephoto lenses.  VR always can be turned off.  For any serious amateur or anyone else who thinks photo sharpness is very important, you will want to stick with the f/2.8 constant lenses.  The cheaper lenses tend to be a bit soft and very, very slow in comparison.Given all of the options out there (eg, Canon, Nikon's new line, etc), this is still a good, solid choice for the price.  When shopping, I did like the feel of the Pentax K10D and because Image Stabilization for the K10D is built into the body and not the individual lenses (Nikon's and Canon's are in each lens).  However, the K10D seemed to have a softness in photo quality (moreso than what I am experiencing with the Nikon), which is indicated in comments in various online forums.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nikon D80 camera", "Author": "CMG", "ReviewID": "R2M9Q5VXTIO3YG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera, easy to use for the intermedate to experienced photographer.

I originally was looking hardcore at the D40 adn D60 or the Canon XTi or XSi.  The D80 was out of my price range and not really on my radar.  I went into Circuit City knowing kind of what I wanted but knowing that I was open to being upsold.  Upsold I was and I won't get into that bc it's irrelevant (though I can tell you I'll never buy a product from Circuit City again).  Regardless, I allowed myself to be talked into buying the D80 with the 18-135mm zoom lens.  At first I wasn't thrilled.  I was worried about the money and I was overwhelmed by the features on the camera.I've now had this camera for about a month and a half and I love it.  I read the manual from front to back PLUS I read the Dummies Guide to DSLRs and learned a lot.  I took the camera out shooting in all different kinds of modes and took a ton of pictures in my house of just anything with the manual open.  In this way, I learned a lot about the D80 and am 100% satisfied with my purchase.  When I look at the D80 and then other cameras, it just has so many features on it that I cannot drum up any buyer's remorse.  I am a novice DSLR user and I know that I haven't even reached the tip of the ice berg on using this camera in the myriad ways it can be used.I wanted to buy a camera that would be quality, that would be sturdy, that would complement a novice DSLR user and would allow me to grow with it as I became more aware of its features.  I recently took a trip to LA and I took over a thousand pictures.  Even on auto mode, the quality of the pictures was absurdly high.  Once I stopped babying the camera (keeping the lens off and the camera safely in its camera bag) and started just bringing it with me (throwing it over my shoulder or in my tote bag), I started to have a lot of fun with it.Bottom line is that I researched a lot of cameras and read a lot of reviews before buying this camera.  There are merits to buying different cameras but I am not disappointed with my purchase at all.  To those who are novices like me, I truly feel that this is a camera that you can use point and shoot OR to learn on to take artistic shots.  I hope that this review helped you.  Good luck!Oh one last thing...I ended up buying the 18-55mm VR (Vibration Reduction) lens separately.  I highly recommend this lens.  The 18-135mm lens that comes with the kit is good and allows you to get pretty close to subjects far away and so I appreciate that it came with the camera body as a package...BUT the VR in the 18-55mm really does make a difference when quickly shooting things you don't want to miss.  I have a bunny and three cats.  When they are up to something, it helps to have VR so as not to get a blurred shot.  This has come in handy for night shots too when I don't want a flash.

I'm glad I did, and chose the D80 as the vehicle.I'm an old film fan from way back, and my standard was the F5, an absolutely outstanding camera in every way. I also have a couple of N80s, and a couple of FMs. So I know the Nikon product line pretty well, and of course have a significant investment in lenses, so there was no way I was going to switch to another brand like Canon and have to buy a whole new line of lenses also.The D80 is a pretty outstanding camera, and utilizes the digital technology pretty impressively. Now that I have some experience with it, I'd recommend to other film users to go with at least this level camera, as the 10 megapixel capability is going to be important to you if you want to use it similarly to film as far as cropping, enlargements, etc.This camera's easy to use, and if you're familiar with Nikons the learning curve will be very steep; it's all familiar territory. No surprises here.Excellent quality, excellent image quality. Of course, the ease and speed of seeing your end result as soon as you shoot it -- as opposed to waiting for film processing and printing -- is a huge plus to the digital technology.The only lens I had to add to my current line with this body was a super-wide zoom, as my 18-35 now became effectively a 28-52. On the up side, my 28-300 now effectively became a 42-450.All well and good, BUT..... don't throw your film camera away. There are some things that film just does better. The ISO range of digital is much more limited. You can't crank it as low as the available film ISOs, which may impact your ability to take long exposures, especially in daylight. Also, above a relatively modest ISO of 400, you start running into issues that have to be addressed in the digital world that aren't a factor in the film world until much higher ISOs, such as artifacting (the digital equivalent of graininess), lessening of color accuracy, etc. Though there is some compensating programming built into the camera, ISO 400 is a pretty low speed at which to have to start thinking about these kinds of issues. With my F5, there are films available with ISO 3200 that can be pushed to 6400. Digital just comes nowhere near this.So, a great camera for what it is.

The D50 I started with in 2005 was a fantastic camera.  Well, I got caught up in the megapixel marketing hype AND digital video craze, and decided it was time to upgrade.  So I sold my D50 and went for the D3100.  The D3100 is a great camera on paper; the specs are excellent.  But the feel is much more \"Fisher Price\" than \"Nikon\" in my opinion.  The grip was tiny and the camera just didn't have the \"feel\" I was used to with the D50 (some people would consider the lighter weight an advantage, but I found that I missed my steady old camera).  And when I took pictures the D3100 didn't seem to want to focus like the D50 did (which probably could have been remedied in some menu buried in the settings, but I couldn't quite get the D3100 to cooperate).  I took plenty of A+ pictures with the D3100, but I felt almost like I was carrying around a point-and-shoot camera that is dumbed down for the masses.So I recently decided to take the crazy plunge of selling my D3100 and go backwards in time to the D80.  My first instinct was just to pick up another D50, but the D80 had enough improvements (yet was still similar to the D50) that I went for the D80 (more megapixels, ability to accept SD cards > 2GB, and more bells and whistles).  The price for a good used one at the time of this review is well under $300, and now that I have taken the plunge I cannot tell you how happy I am with the new camera.The D80 has made me really learn more about adjustments and how to take great pictures, and playing with the settings \"on-the-fly\" is 100 times easier with the D80 than it was the D3100.  I love the fact that the D80 has the old-school readout on the top of the camera that tells you pertinent info at a glance (even has a backlight for that).  Sure, the D3100 tells you all of that stuff on the main LCD panel on the back of the camera, but it is an extra step than gets old quickly.  The D80 has a few additional buttons and a wheel on the front that really speeds up the process of changing settings, viewing photos, and changing things around in a snap.  In a period of about 2 mintues I took 20 pictures of the moon, and tried a wide range of ISO settings and shutter speeds.  I wound up taking some phenominal shots using ISO 100 and a shutter speed of 400 (no noise and very little hand shake blurring).  But with the D3100 (or some of the other newer models), I would have had to jump through multiple menus to accomplish the same feat.  I would simply not have gone through those steps and my moon picture would have turned out too bright and would have been blurry, and I would have shrugged my shoulders.  But the D80 has renewed my photography interest, and amazes me how great pictures can be even from an \"old\" camera.In summary, if you are looking to get into a good DSLR, don't think that you HAVE to buy the newest thing; if you find an older camera at a good price, give it a shot.  For the money (again, 6 years after it was released), the D80 is a fantastic camera!", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "FINALLY!  a Multiple Exposure DSLR- The Nikon D80", "Author": "rew \"Falcon-rew\"", "ReviewID": "R1CGSASD2CFN49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years ago, I had been shooting with SLR cameras for a long time, using my old Canon AE1 for scenics and portraits.

It' s a great camera, but not without it's shortcomings.Pros:-Well-built, love holding it in my hand.  The controls are pretty well-placed so that most of the settings you usually would want to change quickly are within easy reach, not buried in some menu.-As an upgrade to the D40, the D80 allows for more lens choices.  In my case,  I wanted the D80 so I can get some prime lenses.-Contrary to how others feel,  I love it's matrix metering.  Maybe it's because I'm used to the D40's which is similar to the D80's, so I know what I'm going to get with matrix metering.-It's simply fast and responsive.-great 2.5-inch LCD display, plus top LCD which can be lit up is great for looking at some last minute info.Cons:Well, I'm not listing them individually.  I would just like to say that as far as this camera's shortcomings are concerned, they are pretty much caused by the D80's age.  I just bought mine a few days ago (march '08), and  at this time, the D80 has been out for two years and there are features that more recent cameras have that is missing from the D80.  More important to me are live view, and wider (and finer fine tuning of) image parameter settings (which is great on the Canon XTI), automated sensor cleaning, and maybe a bigger LCD.BUT, the price of the D80 has gone down considerably. It's much cheaper than the Canon 40D and not that much more than a rebel XTI, so I believe that the D80 is a great buy at this time.

I am just getting into photography but am a quick study and one thing I will tell anyone is this:  Do NOT substitute a lesser quality lens which may list the SAME Nikon Lens Spec's such as: SIGMA, Tammaron, and a few others who make the same type of lens Nikon makes but NOT WITH THE quality and dedication to EXCELLENCE that Nikon Lenses offer.

For being a small sensor/small format camera this is easily one of the best to get started out on. I wouldn't recommend a novice wanting to start a business get anything more than the D80 for starters except maybe a D40x for a backup.  Plenty of Jpg power for enlargements. The menu takes a little getting used to but once you understand where the settings are and the buttons that make the changes for you are at it becomes easier with each use.  The DX lenses have motors in them and the auto focus is pretty fast.  It can lag a bit on some action shots but that may depend on the lens you have on the camera at the time.  The kit lens that I got goes up to 135mm but only f5 at the lowest so getting the right light can be tricky, especially indoors.  I recommend the SB600 or SB800 speedlights which can be used remotely on a stand or bracket off the camera and a lens that goes down to about f2 or so.  Being that the camera is digital you can get over 500 jpgs with a 2gig card set at jpg normal, less for fine, raw, etc.  This is a great camera to begin with, learn from, accesorize and grow from.  Nikon just released some new models you can work up to as well.  There are many complaints about the manual and software but in reality the manual does its job.

After extensive online research, I ultimately decided for the Nikon D80 and received it 2 days ago. If you want my blessing to buy this product, you got it. If you are interested in my detailed reasoning, read on.My Sony P&S; had reached its limits in terms of image quality and creative freedom (though it has a pseudo manual mode). I long hesitated to go DSLR due to their size and weight, but if you are looking for serious image quality, there is no other option (plus they came a long way in shrinking them). The consumer DSLR market is largely driven by feature craze, so let's take a look at what's out there and how useful some features are at closer inspection. Benchmark is the Canon XSI, since it has all of the latest features and is the newest on the market:1. Live view: Coming from P&S; and wearing glasses, this is obviously a feature I liked. However, it is not practical in real use, since it can cause add'l noise on the sensor due to heat and focusing is not fast enough (Sony and Olympus got canceled off my list due to other reasons). Friends who own the XSI say they never use live view. It's also a significant battery drain. Canon's 600 shot bat life compares to 2,700 on the Nikon.2. Dust reduction: Already had dust problems on my P&S; and it's a known problem on DSLRs. However, tests show that the vibration systems are mostly ineffective, with Olympus having the best and Canon the worst. Even on Nikon's web page where they showcase the feature, they say that a blower is a very effective way to remove dust from the sensor. Tests confirm this, there is no way around it.3. Lens selection: Web pages advise shoppers to not only look at the body, but also at lenses, which is very true. I got the impression that Canon's lens selecton for APS-C sized sensors in the consumer segment is straight out horrible. Terrible build and image quality, terrible zoom ranges. They are still stuck in 35mm film stuff.4. Mega Pixels: It's the lens, stupid! Increasing pixel resolution beyond what the lens can resolve just clogs your memory card.5. Build quality: Yes, the Canon is lighter, but: No pentaprism, just mirrors for the viewfinder, tons of plastic, and the lenses are even worse...6. LCD size: it's a battery drain. To really benefit from a larger screen, you would also want more pixels to keep resolution constant. Nikon and Canon both have 230k.Bottom line: The Nikon is a gorgeous camera engineered for photography! It gives me the image quality and creative freedom I want. After doing my homework, I figured it's not even worth waiting for it's successor D90, coming out between now and September.The D80 delivers solid performance w/o going over board with feature craze. It received a ton of accolades for image quality, so I don't have to repeat it here. Just a serious piece of equipment that now is available at a great price.

At the time, I had no clue what he meant, but after using the Canon, and previously demoing the Nikon, I knew what he meant. The Canon's hand grip and significantly lighter weight were uncomfortable for me. The included kit lens (although stabilized) also left much to be desired.

So, my plans changed. I have been a Nikon shooter for a number of years, and my most recent 35mm SLR is a Nikon N80. So, the D70 had a very familiar look and feel to it, and I found the transition from film to digital was pretty comfortable. I researched the D70 for months before buying it and had extremely high expectations for the camera, all of which were exceeded. The D80 retains all the great features of the D70 with improved imaging, new features, and an excellent system of buttons, dials, and menus.I have really enjoyed shooting with the D80 and find I use a number of different approaches depending on my shooting subject. Aperture preferred, shutter preferred, program, etc. All have their merits. I think that DSLRs today are fantastic, and all the good brands have great offerings. So we can hardly go wrong any more. Since I had the experience with Nikons and some good lenses, I decided to stick with Nikon and have been most pleased. Nikon's approach is to focus on image quality, no pun intended. There is less emphasis with bells and whistles, compared with some other brands. The competition among the big DSLR manufacturers is fantastic for us digital shooters.This is a great camera, but I think that Nikon should provide Capture NX, its imaging software developed by Nik and Nikon, should not be an add-on at additional expense. Other manufacturers provide that imaging software for free, and I wish there were an ultrasonic dust remover, but this camera is a pleasure to use.

It saves a lot of money but the photo quality is superb.Besides, D80 and D40x both have very bright LCD monitors at the back, easy-to-use buttons. I have bought my D80 for exactly 1 month today and have not stopped taking photos with it. The light very affordable 18-55mm and the 55-200 mm VR lenses are light and deliver sharp photos.

Mounteer", "ReviewID": "R1ATDFYWA6Z7PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to make this clear right off the bat, i love this camera and the following review will tell you why.I started off as a complete novice, as innocent as a baby when it comes to photography, I recieved a Sony Cybershot W55 for Christmas in 2007, which was similar to my mothers P150 Cybershot, which basically packed all the same features as the p150 except one critical feature that lead me to the D80, the Sony Cybershot lacked a manual mode, the W55 was completely automatic.So I began to look into DSLR's as a suitable replacement for a completely automatic Sony Cybershot W55, which i could not take manual pictures, sports shots, or slow exposures with.I considered the major players first, Canon, Sony and Nikon on my dad's recommendation. I found that Sony's SlR, the Alpha line, pretty much sucked in terms of their performance in low light, the only attraction was the live view, which basically defeats the purpose of an slr anyway.So now the only two competitors were Canon and Nikon, and by this time, my budget jumped from the initial 400 to 750 dollars which was the starting price for slr's. I read some reviews for the Canon D-Rebel line of slrs, this is the thing about Canon THEY PUNCH OUT THE SAME STUFF W/DIFFERENT NAMES AND COLORS WITH ALL THE SAME FEATURES INCLUDED!!!!!!!!!!!!! the XT and XTi were no different to me and by the time i had purchased the D80, the Xsi had just come out.I was turned off of the Canon line for two reasons, 1) were negative reviews about the crappy performance and durability of the Rebels, the former of which I noticed myself. Plus, the Rebel's felt cheap in my hands and too delacate; and 2) after doing a lot of spec grazing and review watching on CNET i turned finally to Nikon.At that point, the competition was going to be between the D60 and the D80, both of which were in my budget.THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO:D60's matrix metering was flawed, while the same system in the D80 worked like a charm, that was the main reason i wanted it, along with modest aperture settings, that stretch from 3.5-22 and 5.6-36 with the 18-55 VR Nikkor, (3.5-22 is at the minimum focal length of 18mm while 5.6-36 happens at the max focal length of 55mm) the final thing that sold me on it were the large number of great reviews from people who loved this camera coupled with some fantastic customer images submitted by people owning this camera.While the d60 does have a higher ISO index, up to 3200, I find the Nikon D80's ISO 1600 to be pretty good unless the light around me requires it.The PRO's of the D801. Excellent color reproduction in all three color modes, saturation and hue is very good.2. Sharpness and contrast (buyers should change the default settings to the highest sharpness and normal contrast in CUSTOM mode to acheive the best pictures) are spot on.3. Lightning fast: powers up in an instant with very quick shutter response, i don't miss a single shot with this camera.4. Matrix (multi) metering system: very good unless the subject is sillhoetted by a bright sky in which case you should switch to center or spot weighted metering.5. Intuitive: i barely read the manual for this thing, the buttons are easy to use and manipulate.6. Speed: I don't usually use the built in flash because i normally shoot in M,A,S or P modes and i can adjust the ISO to the perfect setting.7. 1/4000 of a second to 30 seconds is a modest gift, and allows me to almost never employ alternative means of lighting WHICH MEANS I SAVE MONEY TOO!!!!!!!!!!Who should buy this camera?-Anyone looking to upgrade from a point and shoot with a budget of $1000 or less.-Anybody looking to grow as a photographer, by using this camera I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY!!!!!!!!

When i did I compared the D200 to the D80 and in hindsight I wish I would have bought the D200... Not because it is significantly better but because of its more rugged body construction and the fact it has a sealed body. I work in and spend a lot of time in a damp and sometimes very wet environment and that extra would have offered a  little piece of mind.Other than that the D80 is Fantastic and I am thoroughly pleased with it.It Makes picture taking an absolute pleasure as there is no need to change filters on the lens repeatedly as they are all included in the camera software. Minus things like the CP filter or Neutral density.The colored filters they have included are great.The body is pretty lightweight and smallish and at least for me it is enhanced a great deal by the addition of the MB-D80 vertical grip.The added weight is nice for extra stability in slow shutter speed shots.Ergonomically speaking though the camera is very comfortable to handle and your neck isn't hurting after a day of walking around with it.The built in flash.... well it is a built in flash you know... buy an SB 600 or 800.I hope this short review was at least a little helpful.", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "High Quality Nikon", "Author": "Rudy Andl", "ReviewID": "RMUSTZNAM2RIT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There is not much of a practicle difference in the D70 and the D80.

The extra pixels don't get you better pictures. The D80 makes getting better pictures a little easier.

I've discovered that the price for the D90 (Body only) is actually less than that of the D80.  If you're considering a D80, you might want to take another look at the price of the D90 after reading this review--if it's still less than a D80, that makes it a better deal).For the record, I'm not a professional by any means.  I am however quite a practiced amateur.  I've had the Nikon D80 for about 6 months now.  If you're looking at digital cameras, this model is older and some call it \"obsolete\", but if your goals are not huge, the D80 does an absolutely excellent job.The feel of the D80 is nice:  the body is much lighter than my film cameras, and even weighs less than my first true digital camera, which was smaller in size.  Lenses interchange easily, and the LCD screen at the top is easy to read in most lighting conditions.  One thing I like is that it is fairly easy to flip through manual settings without having to use the LCD screen on the back.  But perhaps my favorite feature is the D80's fast shutter speed:  as long as you're not expecting red-eye flash adjustment in extreme low-light conditions, the D80 snaps pic after pic in quick succession; multi-frame photography lets you hold down on the button and just keep shooting.  I've used an 18-55 and an 18-200 lens and been very pleased with the results.I was worried that time might have put some limits on the D80's capability to load newer, faster SDHC media, but apparently it will hold a memory card up to 32GB in size.  My 16GB stick formats easily.  10.2MP on 16GB means about 4,000 pictures on high quality JPG, 2,000 on the super-high quality JPG, and RAW would probably still give you about 1,000 (but I haven't needed to shoot in RAW for what I'm doing).Battery life is fairly good on the D80.  If you're using a large lens or the built-in flash, of course you will drain the battery quicker, but to give you an example, I shot about 1,500 frames over two hours at an outdoor event using an 18-200 zoom.  The battery meter was about halfway down by the time I was through.  I really enjoy the quality of the auto-focus in that the D80s 11 focal points give extremely good focus to your final images, but I am a bit disappointed in the auto-exposure because it tends to over-expose:  better to drop the exposure down a notch, keep your color ranges intact, and then bump up the lightness in an image editing tool later.  ISO sensitivity ranges from 100 to 4000, though I can't imagine ever needing to go over 1600 (like I said, not a professional).Probably the only thing a bit lacking in the D80 is the menu structure:  when you're accessing settings through the LCD on the back of the camera, it's never really clicked with me - I tend to spend a lot of time crawling from page to page to find the specific thing I want to change.  This may simply be because I don't need to fine-tune every setting on a regular basis, and most of the on-the-fly changes I make can easily be accomplished using the tiny LCD screen on the top or viewfinder.If you're looking for a good camera to learn how to dive deep in digital photography, the Nikon D80 makes a good starting point.  It has most (if not all) of the technological bells & whistles of its time, and at this point its price is much lower than the newer generation.

I shoot a couple hundred shots a month unless I am going to an event or attraction and then that number goes way up. You can see examples of my photography on Amazon under the D80, Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras,  Nikon D50 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only),  Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens, etc. under the Customer Images area.Here are my thoughts on this camera compared to the D50.I am glad I updated because the D80 lets you do more tweaking then the D50 and the performance is at a higher level. The increase to 10 from 6 MP is visible on large photos. The increased buffer and slightly higher frame rate then the D50 really helps in action photography. The Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack for the Nikon D80 Digital SLR Camera is a great addition that the D50 does not have and that allows for longer shooting without changing the batteries and for better camera control when the camera is turned sideways in portrait orientation.  But the D80 is not perfect. Here are my Pros and Cons.Pros-Easy of use and of changing WB, Exposure, Image Format, etc-Large viewing screen on back of camera-Large buffer and 3 fps-rugged construction-detailed 10.4 MP photosCons-Low level ISO noise seems worse then D50 even with in camera High Iso Noise reduction maxed out-Lower number of exposures on battery charge then D50-Well documented problems with over exposure (set EV to -0.3 or -0.7 to compensate)-Does not have the water resistant seals of D200I would buy the D80 again, but I really would like to upgrade to the  Nikon D300 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) someday. It seems to have 99% of what I want in a camera. Having to buy the pricy battery grip and switch to CF cards after spending $1800 are the only things I don't like about the D300.UPDATE: Those considering this camera may want to wait a couple of months.

And nearly all work very well at an extremely high level of quality (i.e., color rendition is excellent, it permits relatively quick sequential shooting for a digital camera, etc.) Hence it would be perfect for them. But for a novide it would be overkill and too expensive. For these photographers the D40 would be a better choice. For the professional a more durable camera with a few more features such as the D200 would suffice. Hence the camera is great for the intermediate to advanced level market.The camera itself is not only heavily loaded with features but it is relatively ergonomic, has a fairly decent battery lifespan and, with the 18mm-200mm lens can do everything that required a large set of lenses (and the accompanying bag) that were needed in the past world of film cameras.

I don't see the D40 as an inferior camera; in fact, it's much easier to shoot to get good pictures.

I use a 80-200mm f/2.8 Nikkor ED lens typically, and it doesn't focus as fast as my 18-200mm VR lens.  The VR lens makes it almost too easy to get sharp pictures, but the fast aperture AF lens is more satisfying to shoot because it's more challenging.In conclusion the D80 is a versatile and capable camera for an aspiring photographer that wants to learn the technicals, while the D40 is a great SLR camera for anyone that wants to take good pictures.", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "A really great camera to grow with", "Author": "B.

Even with \"only\" 10.2 megapixels, it blows away my best friend's Canon XSi with 12+ pixels (same price). When we shoot side by side, my photos come out way better, more detailed all the way out to the corners - crisp and focused - and with much better color saturation. He even asked me what was \"wrong\" with his camera once he saw the Nikon results.There are a few things in the menus and the way it works that are kind of confusing, and I honestly don't know why digital is this way, because I was schooled on 35mm film cameras, but it's all a matter of mastery. Everyone has a brand preference, and I will admit mine has been Nikon since I switched from other brands long ago. You will certainly find people who are just as passionate about Canon or Olympus, true, but when I hear them brag about theirs, I just yawn and think, \"my Nikon can do that in it's sleep!\"I personally wouldn't waste my time with concerns over megapixels. Especially after seeing the less-than-professional results from my friend's 12mp+ Canon (fuzzy focus, bland colors). Not to mention the Nikon zoom lenses have a greater range over the competition - for the same price. Also, the D80 is at a GREAT price point right now, being 'upgraded' to the D90, but seriously, most amateur photographers will not ever know they're missing a paltry 2 megapixels.If you're not sure whether to buy this over the other brands - don't think too hard. Nikon is the best and always has been, in my experience (25 yrs). The proof for me is in the results, side by side with their competitors. Don't be fooled by megapixel stats or ad campaigns. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because of the sub-menus which are tedious to navigate and master, and the body is heavier than some other brands - but I just interpret that as being better built.

My last camera was a point-and-shoot Canon, which I also liked, but I realized that I tweaked the manual controls as much as I could with a p&s.; I debated between the D80 and the D40. The only real difference for me was the feel of it in my hands--I appreciated the weight and bulk. I also liked that it had an internal autofocus lens drive, in order to drive some older lenses that would otherwise become manual. While not a totally bad thing, the D40 lacked this feature. I've traveled with my camera to Tokyo, India, a few cities in the US and around my neighborhood. Perhaps the fact that I love to frame a shot and look for opportunities wherever I go, my D80 simply lets me take the photograph. It is just a tool that, upon learning some basics, moves out of the way and lets me express myself.Some technical details: the battery lasts a long time; perhaps 250-400 shots. I bought a second battery, but unless you use the LCD after every shot, you rarely need to change out batteries often. You can get all of your necessary information via a low-power LCD on top of the camera or through the viewfinder. Low light shooting is generally good, as long as you stay under 1000 ISO. 1600 ISO gets a bit grainy, but is decent enough for prints.The one accessory I recommend is a Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens. It is by far the best value in a light, fast portraiture and all-around lens you can get. It's about $100 or so.

My Brother has the Canon D30 after he progressed from the XT and a friend on the west coast has the D200. Having experience both I still love what I chose. My biggest reason however for going again with Nikon was that I already have a N6006 film camera with a lens and my hope was I could use its Nikkor AF 35-105mm with this camera and give myself more options. After reading lots of reviews as to whether this was possible and finally taking the lens to a shop I found it worked fine. Experience in the field in the last 10 days has shown it does not work seemlessly buy that may well be me not the lens. The 2.5 inch LCD is sooo much easier to read than the Rebel XT. The info read out on top is much better placed than the one above the LCD on the XT (if obstructed in an architectural model shoot and I can't see through the viewfinder myself, I certainly can't see the info screen if its below it).

I have purchased a D3100 for my son recently so we can share some books and equipment, and he loves his Nikon as much as I love mine.  The years and dollars I wasted on buying \"wannabee cameras\" are regrettable.  This camera will be a wonderful backup camera ten years from now -- and my lenses will all still be just as useful on a new Nikon as they are on this one.  I especially have loved the ability of the D80 to act in Commander mode to operate remote flashes.  I am still learning to use the features of this camera, but it is not because they are hard to get at...  Canon certainly makes a wonderful camera too, but I will probably never know because I am now a loyal Nikon customer.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "All good so far", "Author": "Ronnie Klein", "ReviewID": "R2T4M5S8CT7UYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the D90 and the newer D5000 series with video recording, because I really wanted something cheaper to get started with a DSLR.

When I needed to make larger prints, I assumed that I would get the newer Canon Rebel. That is, until I saw it and handled it and found it so small, so hard to grip firmly, so ridiculous-looking when you use a long lens.But there, alongside it, was the Nikon D-80. Since I hadn't felt sure enough about the Rebel to invest in lenses, flashes, or other brand-specific accessories, I figured I could afford to jump ship. So I got my first Nikon.The D-80 is said to be comfortable for people with big hands and fat fingers. I have short fingers, long nails, and fairly small hands. Yet, when I hold this camera (in either portrait or landscape orientation) I feel I've got a good steady grip, regardless of which lens I have on.The camera has DX format, which means that it has a multiplier of 1.5 when you purchase a lens. This means that, if you buy a lens labeled 50mm, it acts like a 75mm lens. If you actually want 50mm, you need something between 33mm & 34mm. This mental arithmetic is important, not because you arbitrarily insist on a particular number. It is because this changes the size you use would traditionally select depending on your intended subject (landscape? closeup? portrait?) You have to remember that the aperture specs listed on the lens aren't what you've got. Wide-angle lenses become less wide; telephoto lenses become longer (your 70-200 mm is suddenly 105mm to 300mm). This is true of the D-80 and almost all other prosumer cameras, so it's not a point specifically against it, it just takes adjusting.It is a camera that can do all your thinking, just like a point-and-shoot, if you put it on auto mode. Or it will allow you to make your own decisions in fully manual. I usually use it either on Program Mode (which is an adjustable semi-auto) or Aperture Priority Mode. There are several other modes available, the typical macro, shutter priority, etc. The camera can be trusted to choose the right exposure in a surprisingly high percentage of the time. And, if you shoot RAW, this only increases your percentage.The menu and settings are varied and logically arranged. The controls are, for the most part, easy to reach and remember. The only exception is the AE-L/AF-L button, which is awkwardly-placed and requires changing your grip.The focusing system is fast and responsive, as is the shutter response.There is a wide selection of lenses and accessories to support the expansion of the basic camera. I have felt confident enough to commit to continue using Nikon equipment and have invested in a variety of lenses as well as flash and other accessories.  I've made a conscious decision to not purchase DX-only lenses because, should I ever be able to get a full-frame Nikon, I won't get full benefit from it. An FX lens can be used on a full-frame camera at full size, (a 50mm lens = 50mm) and the entire sensor is used. If you get a DX lens, and use it in a full-frame camera (which you can do), you lose a wide swath of the perimeter of your sensor and your subject area is greatly reduced, actually canceling out your benefit from full frame.For the time being, I'm delighted with my D-80, I haven't come across a requirement that it can't meet. If I ever need to make larger prints (than approx. 24\"x36\") I'll get whatever Nikon full-frame camera with more megapixels is on the market at that time and pass on (or share) my investment in lenses with that other camera. But I think that my D-80 will always remain my favorite and I will always think of it as the camera , didn't teach me, but allowed me to really learn and enjoy photography.", "Date": "March 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "With so many features, this could be the final DSLR you buy.", "Author": "J.

I was initially worried that it would not be the equal of my tough F90, however, last weekend, on the Monday public holiday I accidently left my D80 outside and it was rained on for two hours, quite heavy rain. I am immensely relieved to be able to say that the camera, though thoroughly wet on the outside, is fine. No water had penetrated the lens mount, the memory card hatch or the rubber boots which cover the connections on the side of the body. The top screen is fine and the rear screen is fine too. I had the sense not to turn it on and see if it was OK. I took the MBD80 off and the batteries out of it. I dried all the outside surfaces with tissue and let it sit in a warm room near a heater for that night and half the next day. When I put the batteries back in the MBD80 it fired up OK.

If you are wanting to take phenomenal photos to have for years to come, this is the camera to do it.The camera turns on immidiatly without delay and snaps the photo immediatly without delay. So basically, what you see through the viewfinder is exactly what you get in the photo. This camera I purchased has a zoom of 18-135mm. What that means for me is that I can put the camera within 2 inches of my childs face and take a detailed picture of her eyes, or even something as small as a freckle. The detail is incredible.  The instruction guide that is included with the camera walks you through step by step on how to set it up. So if you are at all intimidated the idea of using a bigger camera, DON\"T BE! Memories are important, that is why we take pictures to begin with. This camera is perfect for anytime, day, night , sports events, super mega close ups etc. If you do any sort of scrapbooking, I highly encourage you to use photos taken by this camera. You will not be disappointed at the quality of the photo. You may use the camera like an amateur, but the photos look professional. You can't go wrong, because when you look through the viewfinder, there are markings to help you center the photo with ease.  The clarity is amazing. I did a side by side comparison with my old camera to this one and this camera picked up things i could barely see with the naked eye. My family and friends are pleasantly suprised at the quality and clarity of the photos they have seen so far. I love this camera. Its an SLR with digital technology. Basically, that means, good old fashioned camera with the capability of using automatic or manual modes, but get the benefits of getting the digital clarity and not having to develope rolls of film because it saves to an SD memory card.

You can access more settings faster on the D80 with more buttons on the exterior, instead of having to scroll through so many menus in the D40.  The LCD display is wonderful.  You had to look through the viewfinder to adjust any setting in the D40, but you can just look on the top-mounted LCD to see what shutter speed you will get when you have it on aperature priority mode, or when you are adjusting the ISO.  Of course, I like having 10 MP over 6 MP, not that it makes much of a difference if you are making smaller prints.  I have printed flawless 12x18 posters with the 6MP D40.

The Nikon D80 is the best camera that you can purchase under $1000 dollars hands down. I have a close friend who purchased a Canon 40d and you can't tell the pictures apart.At times the 18-55mm lens is slow to focus. I attribute that to the lens and not the camera. The 55-200mm VR lens functions flawlessly. The 18-55mm lens is really cheap because it sells for under $100 and the saying goes you get what you pay for. And as for the camera body..........you get more than what you pay for.", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "I Love My Camera!", "Author": "Marie \"ZQuilts\"", "ReviewID": "R3N5J2K1VUOGF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Nikon user for many years and have Nikon SLR's from the F through the F4S.

I have discussed the differences with a friend who has the D200. He bought his specifically for the accelerated burst rate on the D200. I have been very impressed with the burst rate on the D80 & it is more than enough for the things I take photos of the most. This is the best Nikon digital for the money IMHO. Other post 1977 Nikon lenses work on the camera (something that it not as true for the D40 - another reason that I wanted the D80).I have small hands and the D80 fits perfectly. I found the F4S and the D200 a bit too large for a comfortable grip for me. I use this camera every day - and still have lots of things to try out on it.Uploading photos is a breeze.

After months of research and comparison shopping, I decided on the D80. This camera was awesome right out of the box - I was taking amazing pictures the very first day I got it! It comes with a quick-start guide which shows you the basics, and by the time the battery charged (an hour and a half) I was off & running!I don't know why I waited so long, I absolutely love this camera! Start-up is very fast, as is the autofocus, and continuous shooting is a blast! The buttons and menus are very user-friendly and intuitive. The pop-up flash makes pictures taken in bad lighting conditions look great, and the battery lasts an unbelievably long time. Everything I do looks amazingly clear & crisp.I love the 18-135 lens that came with the camera, it allows me to capture close-ups, landscapes, or zoom in for intricate detail. Lately I've been experimenting with the different modes (portrait, sports, etc) and getting some awesome shots. I admit the owner's manual is a bit intimidating; it contains a lot of good information but is a little overwhelming for a newcomer like me! I've learned a lot in the last 6 months though, and feel I will 'grow into' the more advanced features. I guess I'm a little spoiled because for a first camera - Wow! I am taking professional-quality shots, I feel like a pro just owning this camera. It does all I'll ever need it to do.

I've used film cameras (starting with all manual and handheld lightmeter) for 35 years, including my own B&W; darkroom.2. The D80 is a pleasure to use. It has some very good serious features. For example, while there is a \"portrait\" setting on the mode dial, the menu offers not only more options, but bracketing ability to really hone in on your light situation.3. At size settings Medium, Fine I can put about 800 images on a 4gb SDHC card.4. If you are shooting alot at one time (a couple of hours using continuous shutter triggering) you need a spare battery. The Nikon one takes 2 hrs to recharge with the included rapid charger.5. As an aside about memory, I am ordering a faster transfer card to see if it really makes a difference. Some times it seems that with continous shooting the camera gets bogged down, but Nikon says it takes the faster cards.6. While the menus are straight forward, I find use of the buttons, main and sub control dials less than intuitive when I am actually shooting, and some can easily change other settings while you are fumbling. I hope that will change as I get use to it, but it is annoying to find out that when you wanted to change the focus mode from still to continous, you also changes which focus area the camera used.7. I know one of the complaints is that over ISO 400 the image quality deteriorates. The D80 has a feature which I have not seen advertised. It purports to correct this -- I haven't time to try it yet.Finally, I have been using it with my old Nikon AF 35/135 lens.  I have not had any problems with this combination.At this point I enjoy using it and would recommend it to others.

It seemed as though we were always a second late with our prior camera.I stopped short of a 5 star rating because the D80 does omit some nice features that the higher-end D200 offers.  Specifically, the ISO and Wb settings atop the D200 help make experimentation (and learning) somewhat easier.  But, nice as they are, the cost of the D200 made those optional for us.  After a month with the D80 (and about 3000 photos), we don't miss them.  New users shouldn't be intimidated and experts already understand that the Nikon name stands for quality.

So, although it seems like that could have been upped to a \"like New\" condition, I will not let that phase the review.For starters, What I like about the CameraThis D-SLR fits very comfortably in the hand. The grip is well molded to fit my average sized hand and makes it very easy to use it for prolonged amounts of time. The buttons are very well placed on the camera, I am able to reach almost all of the ones on the right side with my right hand. This, again, makes it very easy to use for prolonged amounts of time since I do not have to outreach my fingers. Another feature I like about the camera is the interface. The menus are easy to navigate and for anyone who is a novice, there is a setting in the menu that makes it more simplified for you. Scrolling through photos taken is a breeze, I can quickly swap between multiple photos with the wheel, or thumb pad. The camera also has a feature where when viewing photos, by turning the front wheel, it will show you the different Hue densities, Image file info, Highlighted areas, and tools for making small in camera edits such as brightness and contrast. The Lens that came with mine is the 18-135mm lens, so the following information is based upon that. The included lens has an auto focus that VERY quickly snaps to make a very clear image quickly. The auto focus most of the time will focus better than manual.Next, Specific features about the cameraThe camera can be set to a very wide range of shutter speeds, 30 seconds to 1/4000 of a second to be exact.Inside the menu, you can select a feature that will you to take a double exposure photo, This is not very clearly mentioned, and is definitely a big plus.The camera can be set to take very low resolution images in JPEG format, and also very high res RAW files. a very nice counterpart of this is it will allow you to store a photo as two types as once, for example: the same photo in both RAW and JPEGAs stated in the above paragraph, the camera has some simple editing software inside, allowing for simple contrast and brightness adjustments.Next, things I don't like about the cameraThere aren't many things to not like, If I had to dislike anything it would be the include lens. The lens is HIGHLY sensitive to dust collection. I notice that an extreme amount of dust has collected on the internal lens. (I know the difference between little dust and a lot of dust) The dust is not my fault either, the camera is stored inside a case and the only time it could collect dust is during use.

However, they are made for other countries outside the USA and if you buy and it breaks...NO ONE will want to fix it here.  The warrenty will be for another country.  Do you really trust sending it to ??? and actually get it back.  No dice, friends.  So, I found a factory demo from CAMETA Camera for a good price.  I did get a USA Nikon 90-day warranty, and a Cameta Camera 1 year warranty, plus I just spent another $129.95 for a \"diamond\" warranty.  The Diamond Warranty covers EVERYTHING from an OOPS issue to a camera malfunction for 3 years.  I can live with that.  I tried the camera and everything is works perfect.  I chose the factory demo because 1-no one really has used the camera.  2-it was checked out and approved for sale 3-the price was about $100 or so less expensive than the new ones.One final note - if you go on-line you will see broadway camera and a host of other camera outlet retailing their D80's for $300 to $600 for the body.  DON'T DO IT.  If you go to the BBB.com you'll see a laundry list of complaints.

It might not be the most intuitive model for beginners, but I think if you have a professional or avid hobbyist give you a demonstration in exchange for lunch, you'll be well-served.All the things you'd expect from a quality digital SLR are here - convenient media storage, battery life, an 11-point auto-zoom and focus, manual aperture/speed/ISO,  and more.  To get the most out of this camera, you're going to have to do the impossible:  read the manual.  And practice practice practice.First, the good:  the storage media is convenient, and for medium-sized JPG's you can get hundreds of shots on an 8 or 16GB.The battery life is excellent - I hardly had to charge the battery at all during the entire 10 days we were in Africa, which was very convenient as we were nowhere near electrical outlets.Playback does well for the most part although there were times when I accidentally pressed a button and put it into a playback mode I didn't desire, and it was hellacious trying to get back to just the picture.  The RGB histograms especially, gave me fits.Exposure comp and white balance are nice.  It just means that much less time I have to spend in Photoshop later.The auto focus is a nice feature to have on the type of thing we did, what with animals sometimes rapidly going further away or closer.  However there were times when I needed manual focus lock if something was behind a bush or something, or an animal running from side to side, and it isn't intuitive to figure out.  It was only when i got home and read through the manual that I figured it out.In a word, the flash on this camera stinks.  It does the job for what you would expect from point-and-shoot situations.  But especially in low-lighting, trying to get the detail you'd expect from a 35mm simply isn't there, unless you upgrade.The same thing goes for the lenses.  My father bought an extra 18-300  to complement the 18-135, and it's a good thing, since many of our subjects were so far away.  In fact we probably could have used an even higher-powered zoom lens, so you might think about that, depending on what you intend to use it for.  For sports events or nature, the 300 is the minimum, I'd say.I don't really use the preset modes;  the chances of any of the presets being exactly suitable for a picture are pretty slim.In low-light situations, it's not intuitive how to suppress the flash.  In fact there were times that the only way I could suppress flash was to manually hold the the flash closed.In closing I'd say this is a great camera if you're getting into the trade or are a non-professional hobbyist.  The only thing is, don't stop with the unit itself.  You'll have to get better flash and lenses if you want to get the most of it, or you might be surprised if your images look no better than a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "a good camera with many features", "Author": "slim1234", "ReviewID": "R14TC1UNJOCQPW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good camera with many features.

My favorite camera, which I still own was my old reliable Nikon FE.  I have recently made the change to digital photography. Having loved my old FE and having confidence in Nikon, I bought a Nikon D80. Up to now, I haven't really gotten into the meat of the camera, so to speak. I've mainly been playing with shooting photos from the full green auto mode, while I read up on the many other features of the camera. I am extremely disappointed in the flash photos using the full auto mode and onboard flash.  They are all underexposed and very dark.  I sent an email to Nikon's technical support, along with some photo samples. The technician agreed that the photos were underexposed. However, he told me that he felt the camera was working properly. Remember now, these were fully auto mode photos. There was no operator error, since I had left all settings up to the camera (auto exposure, auto focus, auto ISO, auto aperture setting, auto shutter speed, and auto white balance). I find it disappointing to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $1200 or so for a Nikon DSLR, and, in order to get  properly exposed photographs, if you're wanting to just point and shoot, you have to shoot in another mode such as Program mode and adjust the exposure, or, brighten up your auto mode photos with photo editing software after you've uploaded them to your computer. There are a lot of good things about this camera, but, since this a $1200 Nikon camera, I'd expect it to not only take a decent auto mode flash photograph, but that any auto mode flash photo taken by this camera would be outstanding.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "splendid", "Author": "Alexandre Paternotte", "ReviewID": "R3LSUKLJDY3BBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was about to drop all \"big\" reflex cameras for a pocket cameraNow I have both and I am astonished by Nikon's masterpieceA bit complicated for my age but worth every penny", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "don't buy this", "Author": "T.

We've taken about 400 pictures so far.  When you're not buying film you tend to get carried away!  The 18-135mm lens that comes with the Nikon equates to about the 28-200mm lens that we had with with our 35mm format camera because of the digital format conversion.  This lens is versatile enough that you probably will not need to buy a second zoom lens.  Most of the other digital SLR camera kits only come with an 18-55mm lens and in my opinion you would need to either purchase a more versatile lens or purchase a second zoom lens (55mm and up).  I also like the feel of the Nikon SLR's.  They are heavier than other SLR's but they feel solidly built.  We are using a 2GB SD card with the camera and it will hold about 400+ pictures on the high quality setting which is what we have it set on most of the time.  My wife scrapbooks and loves the ability to shoot pictures and then printout the ones she wants to keep for scrapbooking.I only made two additional purchases in addition to the kit.  The SD card (a 2GB Sandisk Extreme III which is one of the recommended cards for this camera)and an SB-800 flash.  The flash was somewhat expensive at about $300 but it does a good job and came with a diffusor in addition to some other accessories.  The flash also has a wireless capability that can be used with the D80.

I love this camera. It's worth the weight of carrying it around. I bought the 60mm macro for portrait and macro work. The capture is quick. Startup is fast. I love the bracketing feature. I love having the ability to change ISO.Problems: compared to my film Canon Elan IIe, it is much heavier.Autofocus, even though it is said to be problematic with the Canon Elan, is much better in the Canon. Frequently, the Nikon doens't focus even though it is a simple composition and there is plenty of light. It doesn't tell you why it won't focus. Frequently, the shutter won't release even though it looks focused. The Canon's focus follows your eye, whereas the Nikon's focus has to be manually located (much slower and impossible to do in action shots). Yes, I know it's like comparing apples to oranges, but it's what I've got.The big problem is color representation. Despite the high pixels and technology, the colors aren't quite accurate. It is unnoticeable when shooting most landscapes and portraits, but macro flowers are problematic. Magenta is particularly notable which is represented more toward red, eliminating blues. When the field is saturated with color, it is particularly apparent. Greens tend toward blue, blues tend toward purple, reds tend toward orange. Where the color shifts slightly along a macro flower,  pixelation though not particularly visible, is apparent.Edges aren't as sharp as with film, even with a macro lens. This is more apparent in a macro shot, even without being at the limits of the lens e.g. 6 inches away from an object, and this is still noticeable even on a portrait when I look for it. This suggests that it is a matter of digital capture rather than a lens problem. I've never had this problem with Nikon lenses before.I still love using this camera. I take it everywhere. I get much better shots than with the point-and-shoot (which I still take with me when travelling). I don't have to worry about how many photos I shoot, since I can delete them.

The first is that whenever I am shooting continuously - usually on location - the on/off switch switches off without warning.  This is because of its location, to be sure.  The second is that even when I underexpose my shots several stops, the metering still blows out the highlights in most daytime pix.  And lastly, autofocus just doesn't work at night, and I have to manually focus.

After reading and experimenting a lot, I learned to take pictures in manual model, with different metering(SPOT and CENTER WEIGHTED) to avoid this issue. But after spending about 1299 $, I don't like  the performance of the camera in automatic mode at all. I hope Nikon will release a firmware update to fix the metering. If you are a novice DSLR person like me, and is considering buying a system, I suggest you go with Canon EOS 40D, I haven't used it, but after researching a lot online, I haven't come across major issues with EOS 40D.

After much research, I bought the Nikon D80 with the 18 t0 135mm zoom Nikkor lens, in part because I have had Nikons before and had older, manual focus lenses that I could use.  It does take wonderful pictures, and the features are amazing, giving you great control with some study and experimentation.  But as for the lens that it came with it, big trouble.  I bought the camera in August, and it's first break down was in November (yes, first).  Nikon repaired it under warranty, but they do not pay the inbound postage, which given age of this lens, only a couple of months old, I felt they should have.  Got it back, and I was happy enough, until 200 or 300 photos later, in early February, the lens broke again, same problem.  This time Nikon sent me a prepaid mailer, and they have now had my lens in the shop for several weeks.  So in the 5 month life of this lens, it has been back at Nikon for repairs for 5 weeks!  And they refuse to just give me a new lens, it is so obviously a lemon, so now I  basically have a factory reconditioned lens that I paid full price for!  I bought this as a starter lens, but I didn't expect it to actually NOT WORK!!!  I am so ready to buy other lenses for this camera, but can't quite bring myself to pay for another Nikon.  A photographer friend of mine who works for a local paper said, in looking at the lens, that they make cheap versions and slap the Nikon name on them, to offer attractive pricing on their pacakged sets.

It was pretty nice, and I was satisfied with the result.But 18-200mm lens never arrived in Nov. It was in fact pushed furtherback to next year. So, I simply returned D80, and ordered Pentax K10Dwith the kit lens.I immediately felt the D80 and K10D are in different level. K10D feelsheavier, bigger, and more professional. K10D's shake reduction reallyworked very well [...]And there are tons of more functionalities than D80.From my eyes, images qualities are almost the same. K10D slightlymore vibrant. But all these things can be altered by post-processing,and just comparing the image results, I don't think that there is anyquality difference.K10D is comapred with Nikon D200 or Canon 30D.

The \"Err\" is still there.I contacted Nikon and I'm outside my warrenty so they said to send them the body and they will let me know what it cost to get it fixed. I guess I should just send a blank check also because they said they couldn't even give me an estimate of what it might cost.I'm sickened.

I have no confidence in it however, and am now going back to shooting with my film SLR (using slide film) as a backup to the D80.I do not recommend this camera.

This means that the picture looks extremely white in some cases, especially if you take a shot that includes the sky. This is the case even when the camera is set in auto mode. One would expect that auto mode would produce a balance picture quality. Instead most pictures taken in bright light, even the sun reflecting off an object, will be extremely white to the point where you cannot see the features or \"highlights.\" It is a shame because this camera is rather expensive!Based on several reviews and web postings, the D70 underexposes and the D80 overexposes. From what I am reading, some people buy the D70 to find out that it underexposes--meaning that the pictures are very dark. A lot of people who bought the D70 got stuck with it because they believed that the underexposure was due to their not knowing how to use the camera. So, they end up buying the D80, which is presented as an upgrade. However, the other extreme happens in the D80; it overexposes. Some people are smart enough to return it immediately. Others fall trap to the notion that overexposure is due to their not knowing how to use the camera. When they realize that the D80 has a defect, it is too late to return. Some end up buying yet another upgrade--the D200. I have not used the D200, but from most accounts, it does not have the exposure problems that is seen in the D70 and D80. Here is my theory: Nikon purposely designed the cameras with a flaw, so that you will never be satisfied with the camera that you buy. As a result, you will end up buying three or more cameras to compensate for the shortcomings of the one before. I have packed my D80 in it original box and I will return it immediately. At first, when I decided that I cannot live with the D80 another day, I was thinking about buying the D200. However, I am skeptical of a company, who designs products to trick consumers into spending more and more money because of dissatisfaction.Don't buy the D80! If you cannot take \"normal\" pictures in auto mode, it is useless--especially since the camera was designed for amateurs, as some reviews present.Do not trust the reviews that say the camera is good, including DPreview.
