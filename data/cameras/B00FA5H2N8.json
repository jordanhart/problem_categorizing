I am writing this review is for this bundle. This is a great bundle for a beginner. This is my first DSLR and this bundle includes all the stuffs that I need. Buying this accessories separately would cost you much more than this bundle price.If you are a beginner (like me) it will take some time to get used to all the camera controls, buttons, menus. But, once you learn its easy after that.Though, I did not like the tripod that came with this bundle. If you want a solid and steady tripod buy it separately.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FA5H2N8"}}
