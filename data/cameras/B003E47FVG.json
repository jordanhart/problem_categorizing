Al Eissa", "ReviewID": "R1DRBS5MZNBVJM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is more of a toy than a serious camera. The quality of pictures is bad. Any simple movement and you get a wavy finishing. The flash does not go on when you shoot, even manually. You have to turn it on or off continuosly with a button. I bought this as a present to our nanny, but after finding out the quality I was too embarassed to give it to her. I bought her another one while I gave this camera to my 5-year old to play with. He loved it! Although the new batteries ran out in a couple of hours.Don't throw away your money. Spend $60 more and get a decent camera.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8MB built-in storage\nTakes video Clips\nPolaroid Pixel Technology\nAAA Batteries", "Name": "Polaroid CAA-300TC 3MP CMOS Digital Camera with 1.8-Inch LCD Display (Titanium)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZrW9qh1eL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003E47FVG"}}
