I've been into photography since the 70's  and already owned some of the products in the bundle.  I had been researching just the T4i and the price was the same as this bundle.  So it was kind of a no brainer to purchase this kit.  I'll be reviewing most of the products on the appropriate pages.  What I will say here is that I've tried everything in the kit and it all works fine.  Cameta Camera is an authorized Canon dealer.  They answer your emails in a timely manor.  You can buy this kit with confidence!", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "First DSLR", "Author": "torgrot", "ReviewID": "R3CLIYPS7IYYEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this under my wife's account, but it is not for her.  She is happy with her point and shoot.I spent a few weeks looking at reviews for my first DSLR.  I considered the Nikon D3200 and the Canon T4i and the Canon T3i.  I really wanted to like the Nikon but most of the reviews had problems with the kit lenses.  I reluctantly crossed it off my list.  I had held the Canon T3i and taken a few quick shots with one.  I don't really care about the video, and all the reviews would have suggested that I save a few bucks and buy the T3i.  I am a gadget geek and I know that I would have been second guessing myself if I had bought the T3i.  I must admit that using the touch screen is not as intuitive as everyone says.  I still mainly use the buttons and dials.  Focusing has been spot on so far.  The other parts in the kit are ok for a starter system, but you will probably replace them eventually.  Only one complaint would be about the case. It isn't really large enough for the camera with the 18-135mm lens.  I have another case that I actually prefer from my days with the Panasonic FZ.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Photography Newbie's Ideal Camera", "Author": "M. Duquiatan \"Iris\"", "ReviewID": "R1CI7GSTMZ1LKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's not my first time to use a DSLR, I used to borrow one from my sister.  I thought that it would be difficult to learn how to use one because of the confusing buttons and camera settings.  But when I learned about the T4i's touch screen and its good reviews,  I decided to buy one.  It turned out to be great. The touch screen made the camera settings easier to manipulate and I was able to take good quality pictures with it.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera is awesome; rest of kit is just okay", "Author": "Bob Dole \"Obsessive Reviewer\"", "ReviewID": "R3S4Y76GNN9OEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I won't spend much time on the camera itself--look up reviews of just the camera and/or lens for that comparison.  I do love this camera/lens, and have been completely pleased since buying it a year ago.  That said, this review is focused on the rest of the stuff that comes in this kit.  Most of it is pretty cheap and/or doesn't get much use at all.  Instead of buying this kit, I recommend you get the camera and lens, plus:Extra battery.  This is a must.  Battery life is very good, but it will inevitably die right when you need it.  Hence, a spare is critical.  The one included in this kit is fine--just buy the same one separately.Memory card.  Duh.  The one included will hold several hundred shots, or something like an hour of video.  You may want a spare in case your card fills up during shooting.  I dump to my computer fairly often, so don't ever get close to filling up my card.UV filter.  This is more for lens protection than because UV light actually causes problems.  Trust me.  When you scratch your $4 UV filter you'll be thrilled you didn't just scratch your $400 lens.  The one in this kit works great, but again can be bought separately.Lens hood.  Not included in this kit anyway, but it's something you'll want for pictures in bright sunlight.  Also, it's another layer of protection for your lens/camera.  I think mine cost something like $5.Camera bag.  Nothing fancy is required.  The one that comes in this kit works fine, but it's nothing special and isn't particularly easy to get into quickly, with a bunch of buckles.  Anything will do though.Cleaning kit.  I've used mine more than I thought I would.  They're cheap, and come in handy to get rid of smudges and dust on the lens.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Like it", "Author": "Somagarn Yordmanee", "ReviewID": "R86LFMECAECXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it as a graduation gift for my cousin.

Pictures are crisp and clear.  The functions are easily understood and used.  I had some difficulty with software functions that are in the book but not on my camera.  Not sure if I can update that or what but really not urgent for me.  Only thing that I can't find that I would like to be able to use is the copyright function.  It's in the book but I can't seem to find it on the camera.

Olson", "ReviewID": "R26XWX9RFA33GM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought so that I could take greart pictures, take quick family picturs in ambient indoor light, and take astronomy pictures.Great at all three.  Many have revewed the technical aspects of this camera, so I will not do that here except for the following negative.  There is no explanation of how the camera calculates the AUTO selection of shutter, aperature and ISO for pictures, especially low light.  I feel that the selection choices could be a lot better as evidenced by the variability in quality when taking ambient light photos.  Fairly good selections for aperature are selected, however, I have experienced wild swings in shutter and ISO which either blur because too low a shutter was selected or grain because to high of ISO.  ISO above 800 is not great and photos look pretty bad at ISO 6400.  So, the camera should have a predictable curve like the old Cannon A1 film camera had and this curve should be printed in the manual (like it was for the A1). I hope canon fixes this in a firmware update.  At least if some charts were available to the public people like me would know if the camera was performig to specs.  Currenty, to guarante a good picture in indoor ambient ligt (low light) I have to look in the viewfinder and verify good selections are made for ISO vs shutter, then over ride the camera and by that time I will miss the low light shot of a moving grandkid (is there any other kind of kid when you are takng pictures)", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok", "Author": "NN", "ReviewID": "R1KWRLG8EL467S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Remote is not workingFlash is not compatibleBag poor qualityCamera and lens are okShiping is okTotally 3  stars", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,209.99", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T4i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<3> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <4> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter + <5> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\n<6> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <7> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <8> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <10> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <11> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T4i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with 32GB Card + Flash + Battery + Case + Filter + Remote + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wnUL1PdyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008R8JTIG"}}
