{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fun to use, pocket able advanced compact camera", "Author": "Enche Tjin", "ReviewID": "R3AJD56AHCY9VC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung TL320 / WB1000 is Samsung advanced compact camera with full manual control for creative photography. There is two major selling point of TL320: 24-120mm f/2.8-5.8 lens, and  3' hVGA AMOLED screen. Today, Compact camera which has 24mm is considered rare because it is expensive for manufacturer to make. The lens also has decent maximum aperture. the 5 X zoom length is long enough for various shooting conditions.LCD ScreenThe 3 inches AMOLED LCD screen is very clear and nice to look at especially indoor. But when I use the camera outdoor, like other compact cameras, it still have problem under bright light condition. Glare and reflection obstruct your view, and it can be annoying when you are composing the picture . The LCD screen has 4:3 ratio instead of 3:2 ratio that we usually see in DSLR.Sensor and Image resolutionOne other thing that important to mention is the sensor and image size. The sensor size is 1/2.33 inch (1.09cm) CCD and 12 megapixel maximum resolution. The sensor size is considered small for advance compact camera. Competitors such as Canon S90 IS has 1/1.7 inch and Award winning Panasonic LX3 has 1/1.63 inch. AS a result, image in ISO 400 and above are not that clean. But to be fair, those competitors have a $100-150 higher price tag.There are several aspect ratios we can choose. But to get full resolution (12 mp or 4000 X 3000) we need to shoot in four thirds (4:3) ratio. If you want to shoot in 3:2 ratio, you will get only 10 mp. and if you shoot in 16:9 ratio (wide screen), you will get 9 mp. Samsung suggests that 9 mp image is good to print up to A2 size and 12 mp is good up to A1 size.Body and HandlingSamsung TL32 has a sleek, compact body. The lens is fully collapsible when camera is off. The size is relatively small compare to other advance compact cameras and it is very pocket-able.Samsung also has rotating / round dial, which is use to navigate menu and changing aperture, shutter speed or other setting. I personally like it because I've used Canon EOS 40D and Canon G series before, and they have the same concept.Build quality is relatively good. Its outer casing is made by metal which exudes confidence. However, the round dial (Samsung calls it smart dial) is a bit flimsy. Ironically, the tripod mount is made by plastic instead of metal. But it won't bother me because I won't use tripod when shooting with this camera 99% most of the time.The body design is cool, especially the top part of the camera. It has two analog indicators of battery and memory card capacity. Some people might thing it is redundant, but I feel it is very informative. The color of the top plate is black, but in the body is primarily dark brown.Operation and Auto FocusOverall, this compact camera is very responsive. Start up time is about 1 second. Auto focus is fast. The whole camera operation is almost silent.There are three kinds of AF system you can choose: Full automatic, multiple focus points and user selector.Changing basic settings of the camera such as AWB, ISO, photo style, face detection and exposure compensation are very easy and relatively fast. You only need to press Fn (Function) button, and then do the adjustments.The camera also have macro focusing capability (focusing very close to fill small object to the frame). Unfortunately, the macro focusing is limited to 5 cm. So you can't get really close to the subject. It also affect depth of field. You can't really blur everything out of sight in macro mode. It is partly because of the limitation of macro focusing and also the because of the tiny sensor size.Like other compact cameras, locking focus on fast moving subjects remain a challenge. If you are planning to shoot that kind of photography, I will suggest to get digital SLR camera instead of compact camera.Image Quality and ISO ComparisonSamsung TL320 image quality is excellent in bright light and base ISO 80. The color is nice and the auto white balance is accurate. Shooting indoor, the camera does not disappoint. Thanks to the wide aperture of f/2.8 at the wide end and image stabilization which enable you to shoot in slower shutter speed.Image quality up to ISO 400 is very good. At ISO 800, the camera starts to apply noise reduction software, as a result, the image becomes a bit soft. ISO 3200 is basically unacceptable because the appearance of noise is really apparent and the color of the image becomes dull.Video ModeSamsung TL320 is able to record 1280\u00d7720p high quality video with stereo sound. Depend on the size of the video, you can record at 15, 30 or 60 fps. In addition, you can choose photo style/filter to apply to your movie to convey the mood.CompetitorsFujifilm Finepix F200EXR Price: $339- 12 mp camera that automatically process your images to reduce noise or increase dynamic range at the expense of image resolution. It also has a slightly bigger sensor 1/1.6',  But it has slower lens (28-140mm f/3.3-5.1).Panasonic Lumix LX3 Price: $499 - 10 mp camera that has very big aperture but short zoom lens (24-60mm f/2-2.8) The fast aperture and larger sensor (1/1.63) is making LX3 a better camera for low light situation. It also has a hot shoe to attach external flash or viewfinder. But LX3 is not pocketable because of the protuding lens. You can shoot in RAW mode as well.Canon S90 IS Price: $425 - 10 mp camera that also have fast aperture in wide end (28-105mm f/2-4.9). It is not as wide as Samsung or Panasonic LX3. The design is as cool but simpler than Samsung. It is also pocket-able.In ConclusionSamsung TL320 / WB1000 is an interesting and fun to use digital compact camera. It is very light and pocketable, very easy to handle, has nice design and  interface, produces very good image quality and has high quality LCD screen. It is also good for low light situation due to the fast aperture of f/2.8 in the wide-end and built-in image stabilization. It also cheaper than most competitors.I recommend this camera for enthusiasts who like to to have a camera that is affordable, pocket-able,  and has manual control plus wide lens for creative composition and control.Subjective Rating - Relative to advanced compact cameraImage Quality : 4/5Features : 3/5Performance : 5/5Body and Handling : 5/5Value for Money : 5/5Please check out my website for sample images, iso comparison and other reviews", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "TL320 vs Panasonic DMC-ZS3", "Author": "Jeff L. Swanson", "ReviewID": "R2C6BHYQIMUEN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent many days researching compact digitals online before choosing the TL320 and the Panasonic DMC-ZS3. I am not a pro photog but am very particular about my photos. I have used a Casio Exilm EX-P700 for many years and it is, or was an excellent camera that always got it right, until recently it will only focus indoors about 30% of the time. My hope was to find something as good. The TL320 is built exceptionally well, menu system is a breeze, the Amoled screen is unbelievable, strong flash. The smart mode produces perfectly exposed and saturated, very sharp photos as long as it has good light. Anything outside well into dusk has been excellent. Bring it in the house with artificial light and the ISO jumps to 400 producing, in my opinion useless pictures. However switching it to Program mode and setting ISO to 200, contrast 0 ,sharpness 2,and saturation 2 almost always is just superb. ISO on auto almost never jumps above 200 unless real dark in P mode. I have tried every combination of all settings and this is what works best. Flash intensity and EV can be altered to taste and are very responsive, but it seems best as default in all but mentioned. Upping the contrast to 1 will really define things but you need good light or details in the darker areas are less evident. All in all , I just Love this camera and have yet to see any printed (4x6) pictures from any camera rival it. Got the Panasonic at the same time to see what I liked best. The Panny was the only camera that I found to ever get 5 stars in a pro review, and the customer reviews mostly glowed with praise. Panasonic build quality is way below the TL. Feels cheap, very few controls, screen is ok, but not close to the TL. Flash is completely useless. Anything in limited light at all is just junk. No controls to make it work. I put it on a tripod in my living room at night with 2 table lamps in the room and stood the length of my coffee table  from the camera and I could hardly tell it was me! Did the same with the TL and I could count the hairs in my mustache. Outside in good light it does a good job, but identical pictures from both camera's enlarged on my pc showed the TL to have better detail. The battery life on the Panny is pathetic. The TL is possibly 3 times better. In summary, I don't know how the DMC-ZS3 gets such great reviews and the TL320 worse and much fewer. Maybe people aren't taking Samsung seriously and just not buying, and the pro reviewers seem somewhat biased. Long and short of it, the Panny went back and the TL stayed. Would I recommend this camera? ABSOLUTELY!!", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb camera, great buy", "Author": "J. Shaw \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R3RISEW2OZG9J2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera thru Amazon from Beach, and it arrived last week. To date, I have shot several hundred stills with it, and about an hour of video at 720p. I have been a photographer since middle school, using 35mm, 2-1/4 x 2-1/4, and 4 x 6 film cameras by Yashica, Canon, Nikon, and Speed Graphic. This is my fourth digital camera, and the first one to replicate many of the features of those old film cams. So far, I am extremely pleased with the TL-320.Pros: Shirt-pocket small, light weight, solid metal feel, wide-angle zoom lens, f2.8, optical stabilization (in addition to optional digital stabilization), absolutely sweet OLED screen, optional fully manual controls for the photog in me, optional automatic controls for the pull-it-out-of-my-pocket-and-shoot photog in me, long battery life, quick startup, \"drive' mode for ~1 frame per second bursts, surprisingly useful flash, excellent color and contrast quality, really sharp lens, 2000 x 3000 pixel images for magazine pub quality, quick response to shutter button, very good 720p video and audio with zooming possible during shooting video), plenty-good-enough-for-me 5x optical zoom, little/no spherical aberration at full wide angle (for architectural shots), decent low light usefulness (but not a D3, for sure), and so on.Biggest Pro: Due to Samsung's announced TL-350 replacement model, dealers are selling these at cost.Cons: Very Low light is a bit noisy, similar to others of this genre.Bottom line: Do not think I could be happier with this purchase. At <$200, you'll have to pay twice as much for a Nikon or Canon with equivalent features.

Truthfully, I figured it would go back because everything I had read said it was impossible to have a 24mm in a compact camera.  In fact, when I was looking, this is the one of the few I could even find.

I am primarily a DSLR user and wanted a more portable--but still very competent--option. Maybe I'm spoiled by the DSLR (although it is over four years old now), but I was unimpressed with the picture and video quality here. I really tried to like this camera, though. I could appreciate that it has some manual options (including manual focus), and sometimes the smart scene selection did an admirable job, especially with macro shots where flash was needed. But overall the system just feels kind of slow and clunky. i was excited by the possibility of HD video and the 12MP (more than my DSLR), but neither of these aspects ended up being worth much to me. This camera might be nice as far as point & shoots go (I'm not sure?), but it just didn't wow me.Anyway,  the camera I got turned out to be defective (no, I'm not factoring this into my rating). It worked pretty well for a couple of hours but then it just started freezing up every time I turned it on. The only way to remedy this was to take the battery out and then put it back in, then turn it on again. And usually after this it would immediately freeze again. It would get to a point where I was just trying to beat the thing to shutting it off normally before it would freeze again. I tried resetting camera settings, reformatting the SD card, taking the card out all together, removing the battery, recharging the battery, trying different shooting modes, etc. and nothing seems to fix it. So I'll be sending this thing back. I'm kind of glad for this, though, since I didn't really love it.", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great bang for your buck!", "Author": "LR", "ReviewID": "R321SAP2RV85VO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome!

I called for service and was give a return ticket number, I UPS'ed the camera to the only repair shop on the west coast. They received it three weeks ago and I have yet to receive a confirmed return date. Each time I inquire I am told I will be shipped a replacement camera.  I have called three times and each time the \"date\" for replacement approval slides to within two days of when I call.  The service tracking web site looks good but no info about the repair or replacement ever seems to get onto the web site.Update, it is now one month since the Samsung repair dept. in Cal. received my camera.  Still no definite data for repair or replacement. Getting very discouraged.Now one month and a week after Samsung repair dept. received my camera and still no definitely word about when I can expect a replacement or repair.  Many calls, many promises but no action.I guess I'll just have to write off the purchase of the camera to poor judgement on my part.  Buyer beware still holds.....................Surprise, Samsung clams to have ordered a replacement, only after 3 months of back and forth calls, e mails, etc. So I guess patience pays off?

I purchased it mainly for the video option and love the HD 720 image. The wide angle lens is a nice option and if you are into video then this is great for great panoramic shots. The veiwer is amazing and is great in all lighting situations. The weight of the camera is nice to, it feels solid.

People compliment me on how good this camera looks. Brushed steel look on the front is fantastic, same for the blue outline of lens. The screen is large and crisp, great for seeing detail in your images. The image quality (depends on scenario) is very clear, catches nice detail and noise/grain is very low compared to my Sony DSC W290, and comparable to my Nikon D50 DSLR camera. The camera is small and lightweight, will fit in your pocket and holds a battery charge for a day of several pictures w/o flash. The 720p video quality is lacking, very grainy. Sound is okay/average too, so don't use this camera if you want clear HD video with great sound. The features on this camera are nice, such as the smile detection and blink detection. Using the manual mode I am able to get beautiful night time shots (not of moving people, but of landscapes).Overall this is a great point & shoot for if you want to get familiar with a camera, don't want to carry a DSLR camera around, or if you just want a camera that looks flashy, is reliable, and works well.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great vaalue and quality", "Author": "Artlight", "ReviewID": "R2MIY1TM03VPCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little gem has surpassed my expactations.

Loved it and took many photos with it. Its like my DSLR but pocket sized. The reason i rated it so low is to get your attention to warn you. After a few month of babying this camera a spot appeared on the image sensor. With an SLR you can just hit a button on the camera and it'll clean itself, but not a point and shoot. I sent it into samsung and they replaced the sensor. Worked great for a few weeks until  it stopped turning on. I had to remove the battery and replace it just to get the camera to turn on. Then this wouldn't even work. I tried a different battery, but nothing would help. Also when i managed to turn it on i noticed there was another spot in almost the same location.

I returned it and re-ordered. Since then I have taken the second camera to England, Peru and Australia. I have been taking  photos since I was 6 years old and have  used all kinds of camera from Kodak Brownies to SLR's and I know what prints should look like. The last point and shoot cameras I had were the  Panasonic FH25 and the Canon 300 Elph. As I have said elsewhere high megapixels do not mean sharper pictures - the sensors are usually too small to capture essential detail. Also the processors (engines) overprocess  and give you oversaturated and sometimes inaccurate colors which must be corrected by your photo software.  This Samsung produces  slightly overprocessed  shots but if you use the manual settings at say 80 to 100 ASA when possible the pictures you take will be very rewarding. Barrel effect and purple fringing are at a minimum and slow shutter speeds are possible even when hand held or when using the night setting.

The single biggest faster in my purchase was that the Samsung line records 720p HD video in Apple-native H.264 format.Well, what I did not know prior to purchase is that Samsung's H.264 is done in a non-H.264-standards-compliant wrapper, or that the file headers are corrupt/incorrect (there is some debate on the web about what the exact problem is).  But, the important result is that Apple iMovie cannot deal with the Samsung video files.Quicktime can play the files fine, but you can't import them and therefore cannot do any video editing in iMovie.  I have to convert the files from .mp4 to standards compliant .mp4 using a third party tool like MPEG Streamclip or Handbrake before iMovie can use the files.This is a total joke and essentially makes completely moot the H.264 selling point.  This problem has been out there on the web for well over a year and Samsung has failed to fix it.EDIT ON 4/2/10:  After reading one of the comments attached to my review I finally dropped $85 (via Amazon, of course) for the iLife '09 Family Pack .
