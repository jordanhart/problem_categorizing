I would rate this camera 4 1/2 stars, not 4 stars.PHOTO QUALITY:  The photo quality is spectacular, but only under significant lighting, or while using the flash.  When I got this camera at first (a graduation present), I tested the photo quality at Juniors (a resturant).  The lighting in Juniors was very weird, and the photos require good lighting, otherwise they turn out blurry.  And that was my first result with this camera: blurry photos.  I even used the flash when at Juniors, but to no avail.  BUT when I later tested out the camera (outside), the photos were GREAT!  Overall, tie photo quality deserves 4 stars, because it is SPECTACULAR, but only under good light.VIDEO QUALITY:  Even though it advertises 720p HD video, the video (in my experience) is blurry, and you can't zoom in video mode.  If you were hoping for this camera to be good at both photo AND video, you will be dissapointed.  The auto-focus is very good, but doesn't work well in video.  It will focus very well on a subject in video, but will not focus from one item to another when in video.  Overall, the video quality deserves 2 stars because it focuses well, but will not refocus on an object, thus making long movies, or objects moving from far away to closer difficult to film.SCREEN SIZE:  The screen is a great size because it gives a great viewing experience, but doesn't feel to small, nor does it feel as if the back of the camera is all screen.  The color is crisp, and you can zoom in on a photo without getting a blurry image.  Overall, screen size deserves 5 stars because i wouldn't want it to change in any way!BUTTON LAYOUT:  Very annoying!  They made this thing on the back where it is both a wheel you can turn to go from one image to the next, and also click the sides of it as if they were arrows.  This is annoying in some ways, for instance:  if you zoom in on a photo (one that is already taken and is being viewed), and you want to move to a certain part of the image, you must use the arrow part of the scroll wheel.  BUT if you accidentally TURN the wheel, it goes to the previous or next photo, zoomed in.  Then you must turn the wheel in the opposite direction of that it was previously turned so you are on the photo you want to be on, zoomed in.  BUT WAIT you are not zoomed in on the part you want to be zoomed in on, so you must go through the experience again, taking the risk of turning the wheel and going to the next or previous photo.  Overall, button layout deserves 4 stars because the movie record button is just there instead of it being a separate mode; the buttons are layed out very creatively (if you push the button of the scroll wheel, that is also the delete button!); but the scroll wheel is annoying in certain situations.  The scroll wheel is the only thing i would change (traditional arrows are much easier!)ZOOM:  The zoom is very good.  The object you zoom in on is very clear.  One problem:  it doesn't go as far as I'd hoped.  If you want a super zoom camera, than this camera still fits into that category.  The only problem is that if there was a minimum super zoom and a maximum super zoom, this would be the minimum. You can't choose a zoom speed.  No matter how slow or fast you push the zoom tab, it will always be the same speed.  The speed isn't too fast, but its not slow!  Overall, the zoom deserves 4 stars because it doesn't live up to its 22X name.  That is only because the lens is wide-angle.FLASH:  The flash works great!  You have to flip it up manually, which your hand, instead of pushing a button.  That is fine.  But one thing i have noticed: when the flash is necessary, it lights the center of the photo, but leaves the sides just a little dark.  It is no big deal.  In fact, it makes the photo look pretty damned cool!  Overall, the Flash deserves 5 stars because there is nothing i would change about it!OVERALL:  This camera has its ins and outs, and its ups and downs, but it takes great images, and at a GREAT price!  Everything about it is manageable.  The only problem that sticks out is that you need good light for a good picture.  But the light doesn't have to be THAT good, just okay lighting and use of the flash will solve that problem.  Overall, this camera is great, and I'd definitely recommend it!", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Point and Shoot", "Author": "Raymond Brooks", "ReviewID": "R1TGP2ZLGMLMV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our old Olympus C640 got fried because I put Lithium AA batteries in it.  Cooked the processor immediately.  DO NOT PUT LITHIUM AA BATTERIES IN THIS CAMERA EITHER.  They warn you but in small print in the back of the user manual.  I called Olympus to double check and they told me this processor would burn up also on Lithiums.But I must tell you, I am almost glad the old one died.  This camera is so easy to use.  You ALMOST  do not need to read the manual (glad I did).  Nice bright display, easy menu.  My only compaint might be it does not have bracketing ability.  The old C640 could shoot 3 or 5 shots at varying shutter speeds and bracketing widths, you know that one will turn out perfect.But it has other features the old one did not.  The carrying case is perfect, not too big or small yet offers protection and 2 pouches for extra batteries.Olympus makes great point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture Perfect!", "Author": "K.
