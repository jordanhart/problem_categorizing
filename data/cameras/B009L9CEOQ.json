{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not as good as the DSLR, But pretty darn good.", "Author": "Dan Albertson", "ReviewID": "R2SCNKQWW85K6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are using a higher end digital SLR and looking for a smaller camera for those times that the boat anchor is not practical this might be your camera. It is mine. I bought this camera to bring on a trip that I would not have the room to carry my EOS 7D and assorted lenses on.First of all, it is not as good as the higher end camera. But it is pretty darn good. Size wize, not a pocket sized camera. I'd say it is abt a third of the size of a Canon 7D with the 24-105 L series lense.Focus, lock and shoot is nearly as fast as a DSLR. There are manual modes, so you can shoot Shutter or Aperture priority. It will shoot camera raw in manual modes.There are some interesting and useful preprogrammed auto modes too.The image stabilization is very good. I shot surfers at Waikiki beach free hand with the lense out to the 1000mm equivalent, at 1/250th and got good focused shots.The viewfinder is a screen, and though it has a diopter adjustment it still doesnt look as good as a real glass one, or you can open the display that swivels and use it.I found myself inadvertantly hitting the wheel on the back occasionally activating the delay timer. Once I figured out what happened I could turn it off easily.The battery lasted all day, and is estimated to be good for about 300 shots.The kit comes with a halfway decent case, an 8gb card which are OK, but the tripods you get are cheesy.If you don't want the kit options, get the camera by itself.The camera met my expectations for vacation pictures. I would buy it again. Carrying it was a comparative joy. Just remember, you are trading that last bit of extra fineness of image quality for the convenience of a smaller size camera.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$479.95", "Features": "Bright 2.8-inch Vari-angle LCD with 461,000 dots plus electronic viewfinder\n12.1 megapixel high-sensitivity CMOS sensor\nDIGIC 5 image processor\n50x optical zoom (4.3-215.0 mm) and 24mm wide-angle lens with Optical Image Stabilizer\nCapture stunning 1080p Full HD video in stereo sound with a dedicated movie button", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 50x Optical IS Zoom + 6pc Bundle 8GB Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u3yOHW95L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009L9CEOQ"}}
