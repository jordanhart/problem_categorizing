This is my second Pentax Optio WP-series waterproof camera, I liked the original WP (only 5 mega pixel) so I did not hesitate to buy this WG-2 when I wanted to upgrade.I like it overall, but it is not everything I hoped it could be.  I've had it for a few months, but I waited until I used it while snorkeling to finalize the review.  Let's face it, you buy this camera for underwater use.It could be better in the following areas:(1) Shutter release button is kind of recessed (may be just flush) and kind of hard to press.  I can understand the on-off switch being recessed, but why the shutter release button???  If you take a picture accidentally, what's the big deal?  Just erase it!  Make the shutter release button easier to press.(2) Other buttons are small-ish.  Some buttons are for fingernail operation.  Definitely not operable with gloved hand (diving glove).(3) No zooming capability in video mode while shooting.  Why?  I want to zoom in and out while shooting.(4) The battery-memory-card compartment door is tricky to close.  It's the same (as original WP) two-hand operation to open and close, which is good because you don't want it to open accidentally.  But closing requires fine alignment of the door to the body, and I worry this mechanism will wear prematurely.  It has not leaked, yet, but I worry about this door mechanism developping a leak.(5) Auto exposure in video mode is not continuously adjusting, once the shutter release is pressed the exposure setting seems to be locked in that initial setting.  It is OK for most video situation, but if you start the video footage underwater, and continue shooting while surfacing and above water, the exposure becomes all wrong.(6) The interval photo and video modes are nice, but the available intervals are almost useless.  The minimum still photo interval is 10 sec.  The minimum video interval is 1 minute!!!  The only application that I can think of for such a LOOONG interval is maybe for shooting the entire lunar eclipse sequence.  Why such a long interval?  I need like 0.1 sec, 0.2 sec, 0.5 sec, 1 sec, 2 sec.(7) It is a point-and-shoot camera, so manual controls are difficult or absent.  You just need to be aware of that, if you are an advanced photographer.(8) The included strap and carabiner look cool, but useless for underwater use - you need a REAL wrist strap for underwater use.Above negative comments sound harsh, but I'm nitpicking.  Overall, it is a nice go-anywhere camera.LIKES:(1) Picture quality is good both under and above water.(2) Excellent macro capability.(3) Nice textured body surface.(4) Includes a real printed operation manual, not just a PDF file of it.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great value that is about to become greater", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R2P82KU0RHIRX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good underwater camera and a good value at its current price.  However, Pentax has released the next version (WG-3) and, while I haven't seen it I do expect it will drive the price of any remaining WG-2's down, making it an even better value.I don't want to waste your time talking about features or image quality, lots of other reviewers have done that.  However, I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting a few things that have gone largely overlooked, clear up some possible misunderstandings, and identify some accessories I've found handy.UPDATE: I had to check back in to say that the more I use this camera the more I'm impressed with its quality and ease of use.  I own decent cameras that are smaller and more conventional looking and larger, even higher quality, and much more expensive.  However, with this camera strikes a great balance between quality and convenience.  Plus, it won't stop working if it gets dropped in a puddle.  Now, back to the original review, already in progress...Several of my favorite Unsung Features: - Smile recognition.  This feature, automatically triggering the shutter when the subject smiles, is available in lots of cameras but it's one of my favorite features in this one.  Here's why...Most cameras let you turn this feature on and off by stepping through several levels of menus.  Pentax has chosen to put a dedicated switch on the back of the camera.  That makes it lots easier to enable and disable which means I use it more.  What I've found is that it enables me to handhold the camera and still get tack sharp portraits as it avoids any shake from pressing the shutter.  (I know that would be true with any camera that includes the feature and I'm less inclined to use it with them because it is so much harder to get at. - Unbelievable close up capability and the secret \"Macro Stand\".  This camera can focus real close, down to 1 cm.  The ring of lights provide additional and even illumination that is needed when your camera is close to the subject.  There is an included \"close-up stand\" which is a ring that snaps onto the front of the camera which acts as a spacer, keeping your camera at exactly the right minimum distance from anything you set it on.  That brings us to the next unsung feature... - The Macro Stand provides additional lens protection and acts as a lens hood.  I keep the thing attached all the time.  It helps to keep things from bumping up against the front of my lens and also helps keep side light from distorting my pictures. - General ergonomics.  This camera is *designed* for use in \"rugged\" situations.  Unlike many other waterproof point and shoot cameras, this camera had different textures and indentations that allow you to hang on to it even if you're wearing gloves our your hands are covered with water, sweat, mud, or... whatever.  Also, there are a few more common functions brought out as real buttons rather than accessed through various levels of menus. - The display.  I have several (maybe more than several) point and shoot cameras, both waterproof and not.  (Sadly my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS10 fell into both categories, but I digress.)  This camera has, by far, the clearest display of mode and menu selections. - Nice self portrait indicator.  Lots of us like to turn the camera around to take our own pictures.  More often than not the results have the tops, bottoms, and/or sides of our faces cut off.  Those same front LEDs that light close up pictures also indicate when the faces being photographed are actually in frame. - It DOES NOT LEAK.  Not when you get it wet...  not even when you get it moist.  (There I go, complaining about that TS10 again...) - The instruction manual is real, comprehensive, and well written. - OK, I gotta at least say that this thing takes consistently good images and that is great for *any* point and shoot.Clearing up some  misunderstandings: - Long delays between images.  Some reviewers have expressed concern about the time between shots where the camera displays, \"Data being processed\", and you have to wait before taking another picture.  They are correct, that it can take a long time... or not... it's up to you and the memory you choose to use.  For example, when I use SanDisk 2GB ULTRA II]  the inter-shot delay is about three seconds.  However, when I switch to my [[ASIN:B007R9NJ6E Patriot Memory EP Series 32GB SDHC Class 10 the delay drops to about a second. - Battery life.  Again, it's good or bad and largely up to you and how long you have the display on, reviewing previous shots or framing new ones.  The official rating is 260 and that's not far from what I typically get.  I tried an experiment using the built in interval timer (another nifty feature and one that I don't use that much) and was able to capture over 1000 images with a freshly charged battery before it ran out.  Regardless of battery life, the first accessory I always buy for a new camera is a spare battery.Handy accessories: - A spare battery.  It's the first accessory....  :) I've had good luck with my Wasabi Power Battery for Pentax WG-2. - The Case Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Case fits this camera particularly well and has a zipper pouch for my spare battery and an extra (and appropriately fast) SD card.  I did do what I always do with these cases and replace the carabineer with a Nite Ize SB3-03-01 Size-3 S-Biner, Black. - I've ditched the included strap. On dry land I use the Case Logic case and in the water I use a Pentax Optio Floating Wrist Strap.  If I ever did want to dangle the camera from something then I would use the strap but replace the carabineer with the S-Biner I just mentioned.Please feel free to let Amazon and me know whether this was helpful to you or not, since it helps me improve my reviews.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "amy pearsall", "ReviewID": "R1I3JDH05JKWX8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "we had this camera for about 2 weeks...during that time we were actually pleased with the picture quality and the videos it took..the camera was handled like a baby but started having issues with the pictures being out of focus..the iso was not adjusting based on the type of picture chosen...like the sports setting would not increase the iso up to handle fast shutter speeds...we called pentax and was told to send back to them... they received it September 17 (about 7 weeks ago)...they say they are waiting on a part that is on backorder...this camera was brand new and rather than send another camera we sit here waiting for them to fix the one they have with no idea when we will get it back...i have always been a big supporter of pentax and have multiple dslrs K5s, lens, etc and i am actually worried now that if i have issues with any of my other equipment i will have to deal with their service center...their service is terrible...if i were to rate the camera for the short period it worked i would give it 4 stars but rating the service group at pentax gets a big 0...i know there are lemons you can get, but come on pentax, stand behind your product and send a new one and treat customers like you care!!! i was on the pentax forum today and another individual commented on having the same problem...buyer beware...i wonder how many are having issues.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!!!", "Author": "Smokymtnbandit", "ReviewID": "R260NM42LRXSGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera beat my expectations times 10. It not only takes basic pictures with clarity, it also has many features. One of my favorite is the microscope mode, which is very cool to zoom in on bugs and have a clear picture.

I have heard nothing from them, even after emailing the customer service rep asking about the status of my broken camera (Being fixed? Going to send me a new one?  Bueller?  Bueller?).  Complete silence, my broken camera is gone to their facility, and I have no idea what's happening.My feeling is now doubly negative:  The camera stopped working after four uses and Pentax's customer service is terrible.Original review:I will keep this review short and to the point:  I wouldn't recommend this camera for underwater usage.  It worked three times underwater -- in a swimming pool, and then twice in the ocean around Hawaii while snorkeling.  After the fourth use, in the ocean while snorkeling, it stopped working.  I recharged the battery and checked all the [few] moving parts and everything looking intact and correct.  But it won't turn on.I bought a Canon D20 at a local store in Hawaii and that has been working fine after many uses in the ocean.Additional info:  I notice that the Pentax is made in Indonesia and the Canon I replaced it with is made in Japan.  I'm not an expert on Asian high-tech factories or manufacturing standards, but I'd hazard the guess that a digital camera made in Indonesia, while cheaper to manufacture, isn't put together at the same quality level as a camera made in Japan.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Complete Failure first time in water", "Author": "Rick M.", "ReviewID": "R21S1IJKRI403V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to bring on our 20th Anniversery trip to Belize.

Camera was delivered by Portable Guy two days after ordering (on standard shipping) which means it went with us so proper credit to them, and I was impressed by the pictures we got.A worthy replacement with some good upgrades from the older unit - battery life seems comparable if you're not shooting video.  Shooting video tends to run the batteries down a bit quicker that with the old unit, not surprising since it's 1080 video at up to 60 fps, and will do 15 seconds of 4x overspeed shooting for slow motion right in-camera.  I have not checked waterproof/cold weather operation yet, but everything works very well and it's a very handy unit to have around.*The \"auto picture\" function is surprisingly good - push the shutter button and it tries to make the picture come out properly - it usually didn't miss the few times I tried to confuse it.*There are a couple of in-camera panorama functions, a 2-frame and 3-frame; the 2-frame works pretty well with practice but the 3-frame is not very good (I do a lot of composite landscapes - there are some very good algorithms out there and the 3 frame doesn't seem to use them).*The face/pet detection is kind of fun, and there is a night shot setting that will allow you to shoot stabilized, handheld night shots (of cities or settings with a bit of light) that aren't too bad.*Video is great - purists might find something to complain about, but I'm not having to carry a $30,000 video system around either.  For the kind of spontaneous work this camera is best at, it's great.*The \"digital microscope\" is fun - you'll get all the bug-face pictures you can stand.  The dirty secret is that the old W10 would do close-focus nearly as well, but they didn't advertise it and it didn't have the little \"fill lights\" around the lens.*The \"text\" and \"report\" functions are surprisingly handy - I've used them to capture documents and maps while traveling, and they give very good reproduction later.I skipped the GPS and exotic colors since I didn't need either (and most reviews either complain about the GPS or say that they just leave it turned off), and saved a lot of the purchase price.

As a disclaimer; The cost of my equipment doesn't make me a good photographer. However, I will say that I would not have invested that kind of money in my equipment if I didn't have some sort of success with its use.The Pentax Optio WG-2 Digital Camera, Black is a great camera in the point and shoot category. Its extremely versatile. I originally purchased the much more expensive Nikon AW110 from a big box store, but after two weeks of use I returned it. The WG-2 has just about all of the features the AW110 does, with exception to the GPS and some technical manufacturer specific items without the much higher price.Photos are clear and on par with what I would expect from this category of cameras. The waterproof and underwater ability is great! I have seen some reviews of the strap and carabiner as a con. However, I personally like it compared to other brand's  options.The only negative that I can find is the battery door. Which really can't be considered as a negative, as I have yet to have any problems with it. But, it feels loose and as if it has the increased potential of allowing water into the body of the camera. It hasn't happened though, and only time will tell. That being said, if I had to buy another camera today, this one would be at the top of the list.This camera gets my recommendation.........P.S. The microscope mode is AWESOME! This is one of the most impressive features of this camera.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R3PLBFXZUTL4PS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is the only point & shoot camera with ring led light, use your imagination and use this camera for many purposes.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "DRR", "ReviewID": "R31RS858BA95MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought it was great to have a rugged backpacking camera that isn't easy to break.

One of my shore excursions was to be 30 feet underwater.  I had read mixed reviews on this camera regarding how well it does under water.  There are dive cameras, but they can get expensive pretty quickly.  Then there are plastic or vinyl covers, but access to the buttons on the camera are impaired.  And most of the waterproof cameras are only rated at 10 feet.  For anyone looking for a camera that will go at least 30 feet deep with no problems, THIS IS IT!  You just have to FOLLOW THE RULES.  If the camera goes into salt water... BEFORE YOU OPEN ANY OF THE COVERS...rinse it for a few minutes in fresh water, then DRY IT COMPLETELY... when it is completely dry, then open whatever cover you need.  But it took excellent underwater still pictures as well as video.  I also used it to record video clips of various shows.  I have a DSLR camera that I use for most of my photography, but the Optio WG-2 has become a very close second camera.
