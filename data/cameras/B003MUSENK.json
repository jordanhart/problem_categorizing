Not being a camera buff only thing I can do is explain what I like about the ZD15.Pros: Large and very bright view screen, the 10X zoom is really great and works great (in & out), the face recognition & stabilization are super, don,t have to worry about blurred pics.You can set the camera to Capture Mode, take the pic and they are super in color and distinction, the controls willlet you take pics of fast motion, night scenes (are great)There is also what is called \"perfect touch\" if you don'tlike the pic it will make them brighter and clear up minor defects -haven't had to do that as of yet!The camera will operate in manual modes as well (PASM) where you can set the shutter speeds, F-stops and so much more. white balance, & full manual mode.Also you can do sound movies in HD & features a self timer.One of the best features I like is the built in camera help feature. You use the menu button or set to P-program andscroll through to and item, press the info button and all is explained to you right on the camera, saves time having to find help in a manual.I will probably never use half of the features but they are there if you need them, I like trying out some of them.I don't know how this camera compares to other higher priced cameras, but I haven't found any yet that offers more for the money with this much zoom and mega pixels and with so many features and ease of use. I don't know a lot about cameras but I do know GREAT pics when I see them.I might add-this has the same basics as a Z915, when installed on computer it loads Z915 software.Cons: No SD card ( I bought a 4gig sdhc--$12) Very small on/off button. Kodak (extended help manual) is not correct on some of features. Had to call tech on two items-simple mistake but annoying. Kodak online chat is GREAT with help.Conclusion: I bought this camera at Amazon for $89 and I think it is a SUPER nice camera and I would recommend itto anyone.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty Decent Little Camera", "Author": "William Hezlep", "ReviewID": "R2Z7Z655J77ED9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My old Canon Point and Shoot cmera died after 4 years of exposure to salt air and sea spray on the boat and I wanted a new \"boat camera\", an easy to use relatively inexpensive camera that took decent photos and had a medium (6x-10x) optical zoom. Concidering the $86.00 pre-Christmas special price for this camera it seems like a great buy and will probably spend its life being called the \"new boat camera\". The optical zoom and image stabilization work well and in sports or action mode the camera is fast enough to capture things on and around the boat while the boat is in motion and rolling...not bad. I have not yet had a chance to fully ex[plore the manual modes, I will have to go back and read up on things that I used to partially understand: shutter speed, iso, etc. For a small point and shoot this camera has a lot of options and modes and the manual that comes with it is very limited. On Kodak's web site I found the full manual for the Kodak 915, which looks and sounds, very much like the Easyshare 15 (so much so that they may really be the same camera). Would I buy this camera again, yes...no problem.PROBLEM: I bought this camera from Amazon (ordered December 8, 2010 & received Dec. 15, 2010); on Feb. 24, 2011...less than 3 months after receiving the camera it died. I was  changing the batteries and when I closed the battery compartment door, it did not close evenly and two of the very tiny and thin little plastic tabs that hold it down when it is closed and has slid into position, broke off; result, the battery compartment door will not stay closed and the camera will not work. Amazon says that this is Kodaks problem, Kodak says no no no, talk to Amazon. I was becoming fond of the camera, for a small point and shoot it took impressive photos. My new/next camera will not be a \"Made in China\" Kodak product. It will probably be a made in China Nikon or Canon.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Interestingly featured camera", "Author": "AC", "ReviewID": "RWN5NKBXP8IZ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I would say that this camera exceeded my expectations. It provides an interesting selection of features at a relatively low price point. From what I have experienced in poor-moderate shooting conditions it seems to do a reasonable job given it's size and cost. It does suffer from more significant lensing, color distortion, and noise than mega-zooms from other manufactures, but at the time of purchase these were about 30-40% more expensive. The only major concern that I have is the high level of JPEG compression that Kodak uses, it seems that in some cases details that should have been captured are lost, and there is no way to change the compression level. This camera does, however, provide a fairly large number of manual controls which can be useful in situations where there is sufficient time to compose a shot. I would not recommend this for someone who just wants a simple point and shoot, as there are probably better options, but I would recommend this for someone who is interested in manual control but is not yet ready for a DSLR.On a final note I would agree with other reviews that say this is basically a Z915. I actually compared the extend user manuals, and the only difference I found was all the \"9\" were replaced by \"D.\" While I'm not a big fan of the confusion this causes, it doesn't really affect the way the product operates.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Low Price", "Author": "Alejandro Lizama", "ReviewID": "R1H1V5P0ZT97SW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from Chile, bought the camera by courier because offer price $89 tempted me, really satisfied with photo quality, awesome 10x zoom and fast-flick, like a manual camera (i have a nikon coolpix, it takes like 2-3 seconds to take a photo). Very happy with that purchase, manual parameters are very cool. Instructions on screen, do not need access menu outside the picture to change features.I reccomend this product highly.

I bought her original camera in July of 2010 and it was accidentally broken September 2011.  It was a \"discontinued\", I guess, as I was unable to find it in any stores.  We found it online and she HAD to have it.  She really loves the camera.  Glad I was able to locate it for her.  We didn't need any of the extras that I had to buy, however.  We got rechargeable batteries and a memory stick.  It would have been better (and less expensive) if I could have chosen not to get the extras.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "Rikki", "ReviewID": "R2LSZ7PGQ8PUC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera!

It takes nice pictures and was easy to use. Has a lot of nice settings you can play with and try out.....but on the other hand, I took it on vacation and it quit working!!!! Was not happy! The lens was stuck in the zoom position and it will not turn on/off-anything! When i noticed it was going downhill was when it wouldnt let me flip through my pix to view them. The camera would freeze up. So that happened about 2wks prior to it completely dyeing on me. Overall a good camera while it lasted but not worth what i paid for it a year ago!", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "Chudwad1", "ReviewID": "ROC2DK9DVEPW3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera with at least 10MP  and at least 5X digital zoom and that was also a point-and-shoot camera.  I am not a photographer, but I like to take good pictures.  I like to be able to print 5X7 and even 8X10 prints from the photos I take, but my old digital camera just wasn't up to the task.  I had heard good things about the Kodak Easy Share camera.  The camera does indeed take good photos but the enclosed instruction booklet, although printed in four languages, is pretty slim on instruction.  It does refer you to the Kodak website.  For example, I was trying to figure out how to apply the \"Easy Share\" operation of the camera.  You are supposed to be able to email pictures taken from the camera.  After thoroghly reading the manual, I just couldn't find anything in it to explain how to make this happen, so I will have to go explore the website.  This is why I gave it only four stars.  One thing I do like about the camera is the panaoramic picture capability.  Let's say you'd like to take a picture of a bridge over a river but the bridge doesn't fit in your camera's window.  Set the camera to \"panorama.\" You then take one picture of the left side of the bridge, then one of the middle, then one of the right side, and the camera will \"stitch\" them together into one panoramic view.  I also like the zoom features which enable you to get a pretty good close-up picture.  Be warned:  the camera itself is rather large; it will not fit in your pocket. But overall for the money it is a good point-and-shoot camera.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "A bit disorganized", "Author": "Lugwell K.
