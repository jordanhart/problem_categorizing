{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Strong offering from Kodak, but not perfect", "Author": "E. Yasi", "ReviewID": "RWX18HNETODF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After having used my Kodak Slice camera for a few hours here are my initial thoughts: overall I like the camera very much, and imagine I'll be using it a great deal, BUT it's not perfect.Positives: I really like the look of the camera. (I got it in black.)  The front of the camera is rather featureless but attractive in a utilitarian sort of way.  The back is dominated by a very large touchscreen.  The top buttons are raised slightly and surrounded by translucent plastic that lights up and blinks when the camera is charging or connected to a computer.  (It works with both Macs and PCs, so Apple owners need not worry.)  It'll comfortably fit in most pockets.  It's not as ultraslim as some other cameras in the price range, but overall I very much like how it feels when holding it.I find most cameras' controls frustrating: It's never immediately obvious how to do simple things like turn off the flash, adjust scene settings, etc.  I eventually figure it out, but everyone seems to do it a little differently, and figuring out which little switch to push in which direction is tedious.  I really like the Slice's touchscreen: it does almost everything except take the picture and zoom in/out.  It's nicely responsive: not as good as the screens on more expensive smartphones like iPhones or the better Droids, but nevertheless does the job well.  It's size is wonderful for previewing pictures you just took, and the layout of the menus and controls are obvious for the most part.One thing that may be confusing to some is the idea of the 'Slice Album'.  When Kodak refers to '5000 pictures' on your camera, they're talking about the small versions of every photo you take that get retained in the camera's memory in what they call the 'Slice Album'.  These are NOT full photos, but rather scaled down versions that remain on the camera.  Every time you take a picture and don't immediately delete it, the camera will not only save the full-sized image in memory, but also save the smaller version into the 'Slice Album', where it will stay indefinitely.  Eventually when you transfer the image off the camera and delete it, the full-sized copy goes away, but the smaller 'Slice Album' version does NOT.  There's a small review button to the left of the other buttons on the top of the camera, and when you press that, even when the camera is off, you will see all the photos in your Slice Album and search by tag or look through them sequentially.  The benefit of this is that your camera is always carrying a copy of the last several thousand photos you've taken in your Slice Album, and they're always there to show someone from your camera. Think of it as a gallery of large 'thumbnails' always available to show people. Another nice thing about the Slice Album is that you can also tag your photos in various ways (location, keyword, people), and have the 1000s of photos available to show someone as long as you have your camera with you, and you can  quickly search via tags for that one photo or set of photos you want to show them.You really do want to get some microSD memory to give yourself some 'legroom' for the full-sized photos (I found some cheap class 6 Transcend microsd cards on Amazon for about $20 each, so I got two and now have 16gb of space, and since I have two cards I can use one for everyday and one for special trips, etc..)  Overall the Slice Album is a very clever idea, but Kodak isn't doing themselves any favors by not describing it more thoroughly, and leading people to think the camera stores thousands of full-sized photos, which is NOT what it is doing.I'd say image quality is very good, but not excellent. (Keep in mind I just take casual photos, so I'm no judge of professional quality).  Photos aren't always quite as sharp as I'd like when using its autofocus, but the colors are nice, and the 14MP is more than enough for my needs.  It's easy to switch into video mode, and other than the camera occasionally struggling to maintain focus I liked the quality.  Facial recognition seemed to work well, and image stabilization also worked well: I didn't notice much blurring to my motions, and I'm not always the steadiest when it comes to taking pictures.  (In fact, i'm a bit of a klutz...)I like the idea of the 'Share Button' a lot, but the implementation is a mixed bag: on the good side, it's pretty slick that I can set up several share destinations (facebook, flickr, the Kodak Gallery, and e-mail addresses of my choice amongst others), and then for each picture I've taken I can quickly get to a sharing screen and check off what destination(s) to send it to.  Then, the next time I sync to my PC/Mac it will pull the photos/videos over to the computer, and then send them off to their appropriate destinations.  I was able to easily send photos to Facebook, Flickr, and the Kodak Gallery with little effort.  I was also able to set up e-mail destinations for my TwitPic and TwitVid accounts, and shared pictures and videos with similar ease.Cons:As mentioned above, some pictures focus was less sharp than I'd want when using autofocus, and in videos it would blur then re-focus a little more often than I'd expect.While the Share Button app is a great idea, there's still a few ways it should be fleshed out: For starters, where's Twitter?!?  I set up TwitPic and TwitVid e-mail addresses manually, but it would be nice to have Twitter as a pre-set destination just like Facebook and the others.  On my first batch of synced photos, one that I had marked to send to my TwitPic e-mail didn't make it through, even though the app claimed all photos were sent successfully.  A second batch were delivered to their destinations fine, including TwitPic.  You also can't specify what message goes along with your photos or videos, they just get a generic message like 'New pictures from my KODAK camera'.  Being able to specify a custom comment would make this much more flexible.They already have a firmware update out, but you must have a microsd card and a pc or netbook that can write to it, in order to install the update.  You download it to your PC/laptop, unzip it (a step they fail to mention in their instructions!!!), and then move the *unzipped file* onto your microsd card.  (The Transcend microsd cards I got came with a standard SD adapter so I could insert them into my laptop's reader.)  Once you have the file on the microsd card you insert it into the camera and then the next time you turn it on the camera will ask if you want to update the firmware.  It would be better if you didn't have to go through all that to do a firmware update, and could just do it via the USB connection like many other devices do.  But at least they ARE providing firmware updates, so that's a good thing!Summary:Overall, I think the Slice is a solid camera that is easy to use with nice styling, and that (with some room for improvement) makes it easy to share photos to multiple destinations.  At its list price there's lots of very strong competition that give it a good run for its money, but at the price Amazon and others are currently selling it at, it's a more compelling product that I'm very happy with.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Slice Rocks", "Author": "Cisco Kid", "ReviewID": "R6J6S9VSQPRV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, so I'm tired of people bashing things they buy because they're too lazy or stupid to figure it out or do it the right way. I don't care what people say, this camera is amazing! I got it out of the box, fully charged the battery before ever turning it on and in the mean time, I went online and downloaded the firmware update. Granted, I understand that people might not have an SD slot on their computer, but most newer HPs or iMacs and a lot of laptops have an SD slot standard, so it becomes easier every day to get that kind of thing resolved. (I have a 3 year old HP and new iMac, so I can't complain about this issue.) If you don't have this on your computer, you can always find someone that does.After I fully charged the camera, I checked what firmware it came with FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS ON THE KODAK WEBSITE, which is listed on a paper that came with the camera. I noticed the screen being a bit slow and non responsive, so I was hoping the firmware update would fix that, and boy did it ever! It takes a bit to update everything and you have to do it in a few different steps, but if you read and follow the site's directions and are a bit computer savvy, this is not a problem whatsoever, and totally worth the wait. BTW, don't forget to format the Micro SD card in the camera before saving the update on it, since it needs to be done for the camera to recognize it and this process will delete everything on the card.After everything was installed and updated I powered the camera back on and I can only say that it was worth the wait and the camera is worth every penny i paid for it. It takes awesome pictures and the screen is almost as responsive as my iPhone 4!!! There is a bit of a lag between taking pictures since it will show you the picture you just took, but a light tap on the button to take pictures with brings you right back to the camera view. If you use the red eye reduction option, there is a bit of a delay between what you see and what you shoot, which can be difficult if you have small kids like me or kids in sports and such. I just turn that option off and do the automatic flash and I can always touch up pictures on the computer if it is too bad.The LCD display is a bit grainy in low light, but the pictures come out great and the flash does what it is supposed to do. The camera takes great pictures in auto mode and adjusts accordingly. There is also an option to change everything manually, but I probably won't mess with it unless I have plenty of time or I want to be really creative.About the internal memory; the camera's documentation and description clearly states that the internal memory only stores a thumbnail of your pictures, not a full version and that a micro SD card has to be installed. Again, if you don't read anything, you have no reason to complain. You can buy a good 4 gig card on Amazon for like 5 bucks nowadays, so please don't complain. That is an amazing price, since they were $40 a little over a year ago. Just make sure it comes with an adapter if you want to plug it directly into your computer.This camera has some awesome options, mainly the share button and you can tag people and upload directly to facebook or wherever you want to send pictures to, just check it on the screen and everything gets done for you. The camera does however not have some gadgets that other cameras have, like that black and white picture option with a splash of color like some Canons have, but oh well, that will only be part of that creative mood that comes out once in a while and there is computer software for that.Over all this camera is awesome and I highly recommend it if you don't like buttons and a good camera. Check store websites often since this camera is being offered at 199 a lot, and that's a really good price for what you get.I hope this review helps and convinces you to go ahead and get this camera.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "To Make Your First Experience A Little Better...", "Author": "George B.", "ReviewID": "R3MGGK800QVT1T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"The internal memory holds up to 5,000 pictures in HD resolution\"... well it's not a big deal, but this apparently does not mean what you might think it means!  After hours on hold with Kodak Chat and Kodak Phone I've finally decided that... No, you can't use Internal Memory for much of anything.  You must buy the additional external memory card (available above, and very cheap). When you first get the camera it will be set at 10MP pictures and you will see that you have 00007 pictures available on internal memory at that setting!  If you change it to 2MP pictures you will have 00033 pictures available on internal memory.  I was thinking... \"What about my 5000 pictures that they talk about!!\"  I guess that 90% of internal memory is used for software and the Kodak Album or whatever.  This is not bad thing but I gave it one less star because of the hours spent figuring it out!  So now you don't have to.  I have no idea why they stress the \"5000 pictures stored on internal memory\" without telling you that you MUST buy the external card too if you need to store a bunch of pictures before you download them to your computer.  Order the external card when you buy the camera so it's one less thing that you have to do later, a spare battery too if they sell one. geop.s.

But my wife insists we have a more family oriented camera that she can carry. Where she is involved it means it must look cool, not cute but cool, it must be stlylish and compact, sleek and fashionable. Sound familiar? But most importantly, to her, it must be simple to use, rugged - imaging riding through life in her purse.... - and it must make actually seeing and sending and showing off her (our) pictures a no brainer.So Slice is selected. Does it cut it? It certainly looks good. It has a touchscreen LCD. It has a human interface (instead if a technical cryptic interface), it takes great pictures (not DSLR quality but close in some cases and not as close in difficult situations - but it's not a DSLR). But here is where it made the grade and got by the 'wife factor' it's a slam dunk to take, share, send, categorize and get really involved with the pictures she (we) take. It's something like 3 steps to send pictures to facebook and to eamil them to the kids. It's a gas to watch it recognize faces and tag them as the poor subjects they are.... and then there is this Album thing.Imagine just taking all the pictures you want, do what you want with them, but secretly the Slice camera tucks away a copy in an Album. Up to something like 4 or 5 thousand. When mom meets up for lunch and complains she hasn't seen the kids in months, my wife just whips out the Slice and brings her up to date months at a time. It's a really nice feature in a camera.I almost never review anything I buy. I'm a gadget hound and it would take up half my spare time. But if a camera can make me the hero that Slice did in my wife's eyes - I must review it.

I spent a great deal of time researching the camera, looking at other options in a similar price bracket and ease of use. Initially I was happy with my purchase, the camera seemed to take good pictures on the smart capture setting - but the more I used my camera the less happy I became.First, I find it EXTREMELY annoying that every time I shut my camera off it reverts back to smart capture. This is such a pain! If I turn my camera off to save battery life during an event I have to choose the options I want again. Such a hassle of time - mostly because of the slow response of the camera and touch screen.Second, the touch screen option seems cool and awesome at first, but believe me it's not. It's slow to respond, and half the time doesn't recognize the option I am touching.Third, this camera is SLOW. Don't rely on the Slice for important events such as Christmas, birthdays or kids games & performances because this camera is the slowest thing I have EVER used. Not only is it slow regarding the options panel and toch screen - it take 5-30 seconds to snap a picture! Half the time when it snaps a picture it flashes takes an ok picture, than flashes again and takes a picture that is TOO bright, turning the picture all white. Yes, this is partially my fault because I press the button to take a picture more than once, BUT when I press the button down to snap a photo I assume the photo will be immediately taken after pressing - so I press again because nothing happens after more than five seconds. That is ridiculous.Fourth, the picture quality isn't that great. Outside when the sun is shining pictures are pretty awesome. Inside, in cloudy weather, etc - horrible pictures. And yes I have used the Program settings and adjusted - but they still come out fuzzy or when enlarged slightly - pixelated. My iPhone takes better photos - no joke.Fifth, the amount of photos that result in red-eye is mind-boggling. Every single photo of my children they all have crazy red eye or look as if they have cataracts. I've owned two Sony cameras and another Kodak and have NEVER experienced this amount of red eye with any of them.Overall I would suggest that no one waste their money on this camera. It's not worth it at this point until the tech gets upgraded. The main reason I chose this camera was because the whole back was an LCD screen - I'd rather have a tiny screen than this. I also though the touch screen sounded like a great idea - I have an iPhone and iPad, so I was no stranger to touch screen technology - but this one just doesn't respond in a timely matter.My husband purchased another Kodak while we were on vacation that was about $70 in Walmart and his camera is awesome. I am thinking of getting rid of this one and getting the same camera.And last but not least - my camera freezes constantly. While I am taking photos it will do one of two things - say \"Processing\" forever or just turn to a black screen. I can't even shut the camera off. I have to pull out the battery. My husband suggested perhaps my memory card was full or too small, but I have a 8gig Kodak memory card - and every time I take photos I port them to my computer and delete from my camera.All in all - don't buy this camera. I love the Kodak brand, but this one was an epic failure :(", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "it's ok", "Author": "Mauler452", "ReviewID": "R3NNHA1A0U70KH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "have some issues once you get 400+ pictures on the camera.

However, a slight tremor and throw the image into a blurry black hole if you don't have the ISO tweaked just right and doesn't make a lot of sense in a point and shoot.The smart scene thing that Kodak has, which automatically changes the modes to suit the shot (i.e. macro, landscape)  is really cool, fast, and surprisingly accurate.  Screen is big and appears durable, is viewable in non direct light, is responsive but not too responsive (you brush it with a cloth and it changes modes for example).  Very satisfied with the quality of the lens, as well as the slideshow mode, battery life, ease of software use (included), comes with a wrist strap, and I also really liked viewing my shots in an album that I could also sort by date or keyword (like project, kid's play, etc).  Did not utilize the share features but it was very easy to set up and seems like a very neat feature.The flash could be better, the album seemed to lock up on my unit but it could have been the memory card possibly or a singular defect in that particular camera. It couldn't take a night shot to save it's life and while the flash works decently for objects in the shade, at night it beats everything with an ugly stick.  There is no compensation either for a night shot without the flash, so you'd have to have some skill/good software to manage a good night shot with this camera.Price point, 120-150 would sound appropriate as of this time.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "simple and takes great shots -- wonderful for an older parent", "Author": "Kris Vonderahe \"God is a refuge for us\"", "ReviewID": "R1IKVIZ2SRX82O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research, trying to find a simple camera that takes great pictures...one that my older parent could use.  This is it!  There are only 4 buttons on the top of this camera: on/off, review pictures, snap a picture, and zoom.  And there are no buttons, wheels, or levers on the backside (where the display is).  Very simple to use.  Other cameras have many little controls on the top and on the back, and that can be very confusing and hard to see/understand for a non-tech savvy pre-baby boomer.Additionally, the display is NOT cluttered with a bunch of controls.  Some cameras have very few controls on the outside, but when the screen is turned-on, they have controls all around the display (that is not only very confusing, but it takes away from the display itself by making the viewing area smaller----some cameras crop the picture and put the controls around it, while others display the controls on top of the picture----either way, it doesn't work for me).With the Kodak Slice, the controls display momentarily when I turn-on the camera, and after that, they disappear.  IF I want to see the controls again, all I have to do is tap the top part of the screen.  And there is a big X in the upper left corner (like windows on your PC) that you can tap to close the menu.  And the menu is only along the top of the screen.  Very nice.  So, when my parent turns-on the camera, they see a big screen with the picture on it, and nothing else!Fully AutomaticThat's what I needed.  I have the camera set for: smart capture, auto flash, auto/continuous focus, image stabilization \"on\", and auto brightness for the display.  Wonderful.  It takes great pictures in low light indoors as well as outdoors (and in full sun).  And the person taking the picture doesn't need to think about any settings: just snap the picture.In order to take advantage of the large display, I have the camera set to 10MP (16:9).  Other settings will crop the picture, so it doesn't fill the entire display.  I chose 10MP because I want it to fill the entire display (and my parent has a widescreen monitor on their PC).The display looks great.  It is not grainy.There is a clear plastic piece around the controls on the top, which lights-up with the camera is \"on\".  This is very nice, because it is easy to spot the controls when it's dark.  While the battery is charging, the clear plastic piece flashes.  And when the battery is fully charged, it stops flashing and just glows a solid white.  I charged the battery completely before trying to use the camera.Since I purchased the camera recently, it came with the latest firmware (version 1.07).I had an extra screen protector from my iPod Touch, and it trimmed it to fit the Slice, and it works great.  No air bubbles.  The touchscreen is sensitive (they improved it with the latest firmware upgrade).  To view pictures, press the review picture button, and then either tap on either side of the screen to go back/forth, or swipe your finger across the screen.  Either way works great.  Very simple.As for a memory card, I purchased PNY 8 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card P-SDU8G10-EFS2 for this camera, and it works great.  I have the camera set at 10MP (16:9), and at that setting, it holds over 2000 pictures.Yes, the camera has internal memory that saves a smaller version of the pictures for viewing, and that is where the \"5000\" picture count comes into play.  But you still need a memory card to take full size pictures that you can save to your PC.  And, from other reviews, it seemed unclear if you could delete the pictures from the Slice album; well, you can.  You can delete individual pictures from the album, or you can format/delete the Slice album itself as well as the memory card.  Very easy to do (but not easy enough to do it by accident).About the battery...The battery is a KODAK Li-Ion Rechargeable KLIC-7000.  Originally, when this camera was released, it was packaged with a different battery.  The newer battery is better.  It lasts for about 200 pictures (depends on your settings and how you use the camera).  So, if you are on vacation, that's enough for the entire day, and you can recharge at your hotel in the evening.  If you need more than that (not near a power source), then buy a solar charger separately (or buy an extra battery).The box includes a soft pouch/case, the USB/power cord, and 3 plugs (one for USA, and two for travel).  Regarding the plugs, one plug fits into the USB/power cord; this plug has 2 round prongs (for Europe).  This plug plugs into another plug to make it compatible for USA (or you can plug it into the 3rd plug for Africa).  Kodak probably did it this way because it's easier to sell the same camera all over the world without having to package the plugs differently.  And that's a plus for people who travel, since they have all the plugs they need for most regions.After purchasing this camera, I tried it out to make sure it would be okay for my parent.

As good as the C663 felt in my hand, the Slice was awkward.  I bought the sizzle where there was NO steak.  I gave it one star because I had to.  I would not recommend this camera to anyone for any price.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do yourself a favor and PASS on this camera.", "Author": "Greg \"MySceneFan\"", "ReviewID": "R1KVO6ZVMPEKA9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First and foremost, this camera takes awful night pictures. As soon as the sun goes down, you might as well put it away. This camera has the usual round of preset settings for different lighting conditions, and they are all horrible. Personally, I think the underlying reason for the images from this camera being of such low quality is that the software AUTOMATICALLY APPLIES THE KODAK PERFECT TOUCH TO ALL PICTURES. On the camera I owned before this one, you could CHOOSE to apply Kodak Perfect Touch, which I never did, because to say I hate it is completely an understatement. I don't want Kodak TELLING ME what my pictures should look like, without the option to refuse. I contacted Kodak Service and Support to inquire about turning it off, and it was confirmed by Kodak that it wasn't possible. That's what it's programmed to do! Most cameras are flat on the bottom, which is great for group shots, and for steady night shots, you can just place the camera on a flat surface and use the time delay, but this camera has a beveled shape to the bottom, and is heavy because of the huge screen, so if you can even get it to stand up during the 10 second timer, it always falls over if you walk away from it while trying to get into the shot within 10 seonds. Last but not least, it's pretty heavy. You drop it once, and I guarantee that screen is going to shatter into a million pieces. IF you plan to take pictures in direct sunlight, you don't intend to be in any of the pictures yourself, and you want to cradle this camera like a newborn baby, then by all means, purchase it. I'm thinking there are better cameras out there for your money.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Takes great pictures that go beyond the price of this camera.", "Author": "MFern", "ReviewID": "R36VGYYTGXT256", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kodak Slice produces high quality pictures with little effort. The phone has a simple design and interface and took a full ten minutes for a learning curve. The share options are nice but can be annoying if you simply want to view your pictures and videos. The video it takes is quite good but not amazing, The auto focus is good but can be bad with videos. The touch screen and the standard features are impressive and depending on the price you pay this camera can be astonishing or a disappointment. The microphone is a standard omnidirectional so don't expect too much out of it in that regard, but it performs adequately. Overall the the review of this item comes down to the individual. If you want a camera that takes great looking pictures with little involvement this thing has your name on it (depending on the price you can buy it for). If you want a high end camera this isn't it, but this will fit most people's needs.
