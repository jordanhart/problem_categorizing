{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very impressed!", "Author": "T. Morton \"Tishkajoye\"", "ReviewID": "R1EQD9Z15IKD7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although it may be a bit on the expensive side, this camera is absolutely worth it!  It takes great pictures in various situations (in the pool, on the beach, at night, indoors...) and also has a nice selection of scenes and settings.  The fact that it's waterproof up to 16ft. and shock proof from a 5ft. drop lets me take photos anywhere.  No more leaving the camera at home so it doesn't get wet/ banged around.  The camera's also compact and has a nice clear LCD to view your pictures.  Finally, this camera is quick; quick to power up, quick to focus, and quick enough to take pictures on the fly.  The only things that I can see that might be a turn off for some are 1) the lack of a view finder and 2)the zoom, while satisfactory for myself, might not be adequate for more serious photographers.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Camera!", "Author": "E. Osborne", "ReviewID": "R2GMBEGLMZ0G57", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few months ago and have taken over 2000 pictures with it already.  So far, I've used it for indoor and outdoor, a pool party (incuding *in* the pool), action shots with my 4-year-old, inside a very dark museum, in the aquarium (including animals on the other side of the glass), landscapes, closeups of archival documents, self-portraits, timed shots, the series shot (it takes a series of pictures every second or so and you choose the one(s) you want to keep), and more that I'm sure I'm forgetting.  It's so small I carry it in my purse and have been able to catch some great moments that I otherwise would have missed.  It's also tough enough to handle my son, who tends to \"accidentally\" drop electronics into puddles (shock and water-resistent).The camera has performed admirably in just about everything I've asked of it.  Most of the problems I've had are because I didn't know which of the 25 different automatic settings to use or didn't understand what the various additional symbols meant.  The camera is so easy to get started with that it took me awhile to actually glance through the manual...which explained just about everything I was having trouble with.  I still have the occasional lighting or color issue, but the camera even has editing features on it (you can actually take out redeye on the camera, without going through the computer or any outside software program).  It also synced seamlessly with my mac; I just plugged it in and it started working.The 128MB card will hold about 100 pictures, depending on what settings you're using; it's a good idea to get a GB or so if you're planning to use this for video (or if you don't take photos off of the camera very often.  The battery lasts for about 3 hours of solid shooting time or weeks if you use it occasionally.This camera now ranks as one of my best purchases ever.  You can find it cheaper out there, but this is definitely worth the price!", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great second camera", "Author": "Stephanie Reid-Simons", "ReviewID": "R10K6Y7WP1Z327", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I use my slr for most things, sometimes it's nice to have a small, tough camera for things like the beach or hiking. This camera does the job. The shutter delay is a bit sluggish and the lack of a viewfinder can be a pain outdoors on bright days -- exactly when you'd want to use this camera -- but those are quibbles really, when you consider what you're getting: A sport utility camera suitable for 99 percent of people who want to take pictures while enjoying outdoor recreation. Even the shutter delay is workable if you remember to prefocus by depressing the shutter halfway -- or use the select a shot feature.  Underwater photos are great -- but remember it's tough to actually see what you're getting via the lcd so you'll need to just shoot a bunch and edit later. That's not a big deal with digital, thankfully.If you consider the cost of an underwater housing for any other digital, the price even seems good.In all, I consider this an indispensible knock-about camera for catching some of life's most fun, wet and messy moments.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "I. Chiu \"socalguru\"", "ReviewID": "R380O5JY13M55S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera!  I spend a lot of time outdoors and have had many cameras ruined (by other people) from getting wet or dropped.  It really is waterproof and the pictures come out great.  I haven't taken any underwater photos but i have put the camera underwater and it still works.Pros: Small, 7.1MP, good shutterspeed, waterproof, shock-proof, large viewing screen, easy to useCons: Only digital zoom, not the smallest camera on the market.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Point&Shoot;", "Author": "Splotchie", "ReviewID": "R2HW8MPBR5R3DN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for at least a year now I'd guess, I bought it right after it was released. I've been nothing but pleased. That isn't to say that it has always produced fabulous pics, but for the most part any problems have been of my own making.  I've used it for underwater photography with fair to good result. The UW ocean pics tend to be a bit grainy  mostly due to light constraints and there is some problem with movement since not only are you likely to be moving but the fish don't generally stop and say cheese for ya either, but if you just keep clicking you'll get some very pretty shots. They won't make their way into any photo magazines or Fish Fancy, but as vacation souvenirs they are very nice. Oh and if you're just fooling around in the pool with the kids, it is really great. I've got some fabulous candids with it.For sport shots it is exceptional. In fact, I use that setting for quite a few things just because the shutter speed is quite fast and provides a good clear picture. But sport is by no means the only really useful setting of the 20+ that are available on it. Olympus really put a lot of thought into the needs of its customers in establishing the various settings.I love the waterproof and shockproof features which on an active beach vacation  come in very handy. At the time, it was quite the conversation piece too as it was one of the first underwater digitals with no need of extra housing on the market. I haven't been in the market for another since purchasing but I can't imagine the market is now flooded with underwater digitals so snap this puppy up, you won't regret it.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not the Best", "Author": "N. Mctavish", "ReviewID": "R251SGCXHGDIXT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera started out as a fabulous and amazingly great camera. I always used it. But then, one day on vacation, I decided to take the camera in the pool to take some underwater pictures. On the front of my camera it says it can go to depths of 16 ft, and I brought it under about five ft. When I brought  it underwater and after I brought it under I immediately started seeing changes. The lens became foggy and the picture quality was not as nice. Then, the camera started to not turn on. I charged the battery for a day and a night and popped it back in. The camera did turn on about two days later, but the setting button and the playback button and arrows did not work. I could still take pictures, yes, but i could not look at them or change the camera setting. The power and menu button were the only things that worked. So, my camera review is not as good as all of the others because the camera did not live up to the expectations. I trusted the camera and I am an active person. So, when i bought this camera i thought it would be a great product for me. But, as you can see, I was not so lucky. I hope this review helps.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Didn't receive the memory accessory kit that was advertized", "Author": "Terry D \"Terry D\"", "ReviewID": "R2UZBKITVE6604", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera itself is amazing - in beautiful shape and got anunbelievable deal but the ad stated that a memory kitcame with the purchase and we did not receive it.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Snorkelers Dream!", "Author": "C.

I have never been one to drag a camera around, but have changed my habits since getting this one.  I specifically bought it to use for underwater photos while snorkeling and it has more than exceeded my expectations.  I have taken some amazing pictures and videos underwater...something that usually requires an expensive,bulky housing.  Overall I have had no problems with the camera.  It is easy to use and not bulky at all.  Also, its great to see the look on people's face when they think you have accidentally gotten your expensive digital camera wet!
