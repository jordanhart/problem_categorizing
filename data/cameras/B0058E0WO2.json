{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works as Advertised.", "Author": "SRS", "ReviewID": "R46DHNENIQ55U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in rowhome/townhome with a common driveway in the rear. We live in an urban area. A few weeks ago, someone walked into my yard and stole a bike that was locked to my fence. I was more concerned than angry as it was located near my back door and I was home at the time. What's to stop them from coming inside next?I've been thinking about getting a security camera for some time. After the theft, I started checking Amazon and found the Zmodo system. The reviews were all 5 stars at the time of my purchase. At around $200.00 for 4 cameras and a 500GB DVR, I figured I couldn't go wrong. If you search Zmodo on that popular video sharing site, people claim the 500GB will hold about 30 days of video and it can be set to overwrite. Once set, you can basically leave it alone and review an incident if needed.As of this writing, I have two of the four cameras installed. I have them both mounted on the rear of my home and pointed towards the drive. I've never owned a security camera before, so I have nothing to compare them to, but I am very satisfied with the clarity of the cameras during the daytime. From where I have them positioned, I can see my yard and beyond. I don't believe I can read a license plate, but my next door neighbor has a cargo van and I can read his advertising. Our back drive is very dark. Nighttime viewing is ok, but not great. However, I have a motion light mounted to the rear of my home and when it goes on, I can see my yard quite clearly.I've been using the system for about a week. Overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase. It does exactly what I need it to do at a very affordable price.Pros: It comes with 4 cameras and you can add 4 more. It's easy to install, the camera picture quality is good. It comes with everything you need to get started right away. The DVR has 500GB of memory so you don't need to add a hard drive. You can set the system for remote viewing. (Either from other computers on your network - or remote viewing using a mobile device.) I can't comment on the remote viewing as I don't have it set, but plan to do so in the near future. I'll update my review once completed.Cons: The print on the directions is small and not easy to read. However, it comes with a cd that allows you to view them on your computer. The mounting brackets are ok, not great. If you need to monitor a very dark area, you might want to add a motion light or some other form of outside lighting to improve the performance. You can adjust the brightness on the camera if extra lighting is not available, but daytime viewing may look washed out unless you adjust it each day.Lastly - For me, the value was in the DVR. I didn't want to spend a ton of money upfront. My thought was I could always add better cameras if needed. The included 60' cables are basic quality. I suspect if I upgrade to coaxial, the picture quality will improve. I have it hooked up to an old computer monitor, but you can also connect it to a newer TV. By doing so, you may improve the picture clarity even more. In order to use this system remotely, you'll need to connect the DVR to your router via a c5 cable or wireless bridge. I plan on doing the latter as I am trying to avoid running c5 cable through my home. For areas where you might not be able to run wires, you can add a wireless camera to the system such as the Lorex LW2110 Lorex LW2110 Wireless Digital Security Camera, but you'll still need to supply the camera with power.If you are looking for an affordable starter security system and don't mind running some wires, the Zmodo PKD-DK0863 works well for me._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Update 12/05/2012As mentioned previously, I wanted to set this up for remote viewing. In order to do this, I needed to connect the DVR to my router. You can connect via a Cat5 cable. If your router is not near your DVR, and running wires through you home is not easy/possible, you can do like I did and add a wireless bridge. I recently installed a Cisco/Linksys WET610N bridge. Set up was fairly easy. I can now view my cameras from any computer on my home network. In addition, Zmodo has an app that allows me to view the feed from my Iphone. It works very well and I'm pleased with the picture quality. If you search Zmodo remote viewing on Youtube, you'll find several videos that will help make the installation easy.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zmodo CCTV SYstem", "Author": "Anson King", "ReviewID": "R15AXCSTWLGQJJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am a professional installer of CCTV surveillance system and I recently purchased this for a customer who wanted a very low budget system.

I have more time than money so this system was exactly what I needed yet could afford.  I dont have a clue and this system was SOOOO easy and when I messed up the settings I just reset to factory settings and started over.  Simple. I'll admit, I didnt even read the installation or directions it was so easy.I have an alarm system and I can wire this into it if I choose.  I can add 4 more cameras if I choose.

The web access was fairly easy to configure as long as you go to [...] to do it. STILL working on getting it on my phone via the Zviewer Android App.  Trying this page:  [...]I mounted the cameras INSIDE on my windows because I wanted easy access to them in case of technical difficulty or in case I needed to reposition.  I also didn't want to run the risk of water damage or even vandalism -- which is the reason I got them in the first place -- someone stole our riding lawnmower. I uploaded a picture of what my screen looks like with the web access -- BEHIND a double-pane glass window.  So imagine the clarity if I had them mounted OUTSIDE.The picture is clear enough in the daytime -- if you're trying to do spy work, its not for you.  Good for basic home surveillance.  You can make out faces about 10 feet away.  But if the point is to just have an idea of what's going on around your property, this serves the purpose.ANYWAY, will update in a few weeks, but so far so good!UPDATE 4/24/13:  So mounting INSIDE wasn't as bright an idea once night fell -- the glass reflected so I could see NOTHING.  But STILL love the product!UPDATE 4/29/13:  Mounted them outside (basically on the opposite side of the windows where they were mounted inside) and the view is unobstructed.  You will definitely have to go into settings and adjust the color settings on each camera to get the highest night vision quality.  With all outdoor lights out, night vision is nowhere near as clear as daytime, but its tolerable.  Just make sure you have your outdoor lights on in the areas you want to watch the most.UPDATE 5/31/13:  Had a street lamp installed by the local power company.  CRYSTAL CLEAR night vision.  So the moral of the story, exterior illumination DRASTICALLY increases night visibility.  Daytime is still great.  It rained HEAVY for a couple of days straight on three different occasions since initial purchase and no problems.  So far so good.UPDATE 8/23/13:  Still going strong!  Even was able to go back to a specific time-frame and take a screen shot to catch an annoying neighbor's dog laying a major load in my mailbox flowerbed! MORE heavy rain and STILL good to go.  Great system.  Would be MUCH better if I could access it on my Android phone, but hey.UPDATE 8/24/2013:  GETTING REMOTE ACCESS ON ANDROID PHONE | Okay, I figured it out: I made sure my user name was capitalized the SAME EXACT WAY as it is on the DVR settings, in addition to removing the Http: from in front of the IP address and BINGO!

Fox", "ReviewID": "R32KBEEV5OC4MX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read a lot of mixed and negative reviews for this item and similar models and was skeptical, but decided to take a risk anyway.  I'm glad I did, for under $200 it is a great buy.  It is not professional grade, nor did I expect it to be.  The image quality is actually better than I expected it would be, even in total darkness it renders an acceptable image and the motion detection is almost too sensitive that I had to cut it back.  Many of the complaints surround installation and setup.  The included printed instructions are a bit lacking, but a search of FAQs on the manufacture\u2019s website will yield better information and step by step walk thru.  The setup itself is pretty simple but if you want access over the internet it is a bit more involved.  Like anything techie, you need a basic understanding of computers and networking, You need to open a DNS account, open router ports, and configure the NVR, all of which is easier than it sounds if you just follow the directions.  I had a few issues and frustrations but found them to be more the fault of the ISPs, Time Warner & AT&T; in my case, who block ports and generally don\u2019t seem to like to play nice with each other at the expense of their customers.  If you are accessing from within your owns network rather than across the web with multiple ISPs this should not be an issue.  Again most of the complaints deal with the setup, not the product itself, and we should not blame product for the problems caused by the 3rd party providers.  There are workarounds, and once resolved it was a fairly quick and easy process.  If you lack the tech knowledge, just get a 9 year old to do it.  PROS: good image, can view directly, via the internet but I can\u2019t access from my work, I think it is port blocking again (but this time by corporate security) but fine form every other computer, iPad, iPhone and there is also an android app for those who have not upgraded yet.  Image is fair to good, even in total darkness.  CONS: needs to be hardwired to the router with a cat5 cable which may limit where you can place the unit, although a wireless adapter might work.  I used wired cameras, however wireless models are available.  The wireless camera isn\u2019t 100% wireless, it connects wirelessly to the router, but it still needs AC power so it must be close to an outlet, they don\u2019t exactly mention that.  The software is a bit rudimentary, but it works.  I can see they are improving the GUI.

The one good thing about this system is that it is still working.  But the picture  remains blurry.  I have one camera mounted on the second floor of my house to get a wide angle view of my property.  You can see people, but their faces are completely unidentifiable. That includes people that are very close to the house.  What's the purpose of this system if you can't identify the person.  The night vision on that camera, due to its distance from the second floor, is useless.  I can barely make out the shrubbery on my property.The cables are fragile junk. One of the power cables broke at the camera end while I was installing it.  I found the location of the break with an ohm meter and attempted to repair it.  I couldn't do it.  I could not strip the insulation off of the cable because of the very fine gauge of the 3 wires in that power cable.  I have a good wire stripper, but the wires in this cable are so fragile that they would break while I was attempting to remove the insulation off of the wire.

The installation was very easy.  Zmodo has a step by step guide on their website [...].  The only issue I had was getting the remote viewing working, because I could not open port 80 on my netgear router.

A little attic crawling, hole drilling, and following online instructions and you are set. (I am a female too)  It really is that easy.  Zmodo does sell a wireless package just like this one and for just about $100 more, things can be easier than this.  Although, I don't mind saving the $100 for a little extra work.

The 6mm cameras is why i picked this one but after delivery i found 3.6mm cameras so i looked up the model number and this model number shows up on zmodo's site as it comes with 3.6mm cameras. SO that means amazon has miss information on this product and I'm not happy about it. I have only had a few hours with the system at the time of this review because I felt it was a good idea to hurry up and inform the next buyer so they wont be unhappy like me! I will try to update this review after some more use of the actual product but so far i have 1 camera hooked up and every thing is working so far. I just had to plug everything in and turned it on and it worked. The only problem so far was the power splitter for the cameras is kinda finicky. move it just a bit and your cameras loose power.

Set-up was easy and everything that is required for installation came in the box. Video quality is not the greatest but I can make out color and shapes up-to 100 feet away. The DVR software is easy to use although written instructions that came with the system does not go in-depth. Video recording and play back is also very easy.I rate this product 4.0 because of the instructions that is provided and the camera mounting stands. The camera stands are of very low quality and does not allow many mounting positions. As mentioned earlier before, the instructions that came with the system is lacking. To network the system, you will need to seek additional information online if your not a techie.Overall, for the price the system is OK. I recommend it for a small home/office.Note: If you want this system for a small home/office, you do not need to by extra cables.

I knew that going in so I am a pretty happy customer. That being said, let's look at a few things.The instruction manual is somewhat dicey. English was evidently NOT the first language of the author. Once you figure out the syntax, it isn't too bad but be prepared.Networking the system was a challenge but it works and works well. (I figured it all out without calling the support line so it can't be that tough.)Remote viewing works well too.The email alerts are handy. It even sends a snapshot. Since I get them on my Blackberry, I haven't tried the remote viewer for the phone. I'll toy with that later if the mood strikes.Night vision is serviceable but of very short range.Overall this is still nice for a system that costs less than some cameras do alone.
