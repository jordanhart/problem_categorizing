I've used it for a few months now and it's great for the \"Point & Shoot\" type.  I only have one complaint...the slide and lock cover on the camera used to protect the SD card and Battery is way too loose.  The cover pops open every...single...time I try to take a picture or pull it out of my pocket.  I find that a piece of electrical tape keeps it secure during use.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall disappointment", "Author": "Gene Leynes", "ReviewID": "R260TH864YUFO2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This review won't be helpful for anyone since this camera is no longer offered, but I want to jot down a few notes, which may contribute to the overall Fujifilm reputation at some point.I'm disappointed that Fujifilm releases so many camera models each year, with so little difference between them and so little thought going into each one.  This helps the retailers and hurts the consumer by hiding their quality among a forest of cameras with (at best) mixed quality.My first fujifilm, the F10, was an amazing camera for the time with low shutter lag and high pixel density.  The menus made some sense and it took great pictures. Fast forward about 10 years, and the camera prices have dropped and the quality is worse.Maybe I'm not using the right settings for what I want, but I doubt it.  I spent a lot of time trying various settings and I generally settle for auto, since that seems like it should be an obvious choice for general pictures.The cons: - The pictures are often blurry, it's hard to see faces for anything that's not a closeup. - There are a dizzying array of settings, yet very little customization and control is offered.  You can't directly control f stops or shutter speed for example. - Many of the nice features available in the original f10 are gone or watered down; for example continuous shooting only keeps the top 3 pictures rather than the first or last 5, or the last 10 on lower quality setting. Continuous photos was my go-to hack for image stabilization in low light. - The menus are extremely confusing, with most of the setting grayed-out in the various modes.  It's hard to do simple things like change the picture quality because that is in a completely different portion of the camera's settings compared the picture mode. - There are very few buttons that allow quick for access to quick settings - The shutter lag is only ok.  It's not as good as the f10 - It is unimpressive in bright light, but it's really awful in low light. - There is no white balance setting where you can manually tune whiteness to a piece of paper (which can be fun if you use off colors, snow, or other elements btw), and the white balance settings available are... I don't know, annoying. - It's hard / impossible to just set the ISO speed.The pros: + The screen is large and crisp + The aluminum body looks and feels nice and is sturdy + It takes pretty good movies + The panorama feature is really cool and works very well + The few buttons that are available are actually useful buttons, which is very rare.  Usually there is at least one really stupid button that you never use, but they really did put the most important features accessible via buttons. + It takes beautiful pictures of landscapes. + The battery is amazing; it can hold a charge for up to months of sporadic use, which is probably the hardest conditions possible for a battery.Overall, I have to give a low rating because it takes bad pictures of people, which is why most people have cameras unless they're insurance adjusters or nature photographers or something.  This is the 4th digital camera I've owned, the 3rd Fujifilm, and sadly I think it will be the last Fujifilm.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty Worthless.", "Author": "HulkSmash1978 \"HulkSmash1978\"", "ReviewID": "R37ODBJVSKNSYC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It really is a horrible camera and a waste purchase.
