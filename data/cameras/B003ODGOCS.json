Both of my kids received the camera from their grandparents for Christmas.  12MP but only generates grainy photos.  Batteries last only a few photos.  Hard to figure out how the flash works.  When you do figure it out, you realize the horrible photos without the flash are better than with the flash.  Avoid this camera at all costs.  Wish I could get money back for them to buy a real camera.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do NOT Buy!", "Author": "Bonnie B. \"mcski\"", "ReviewID": "R1CCA42ADLXHAO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have to agree with all the other reviews here.  I bought this camera for my 11-year-old son for Christmas 2010.  You get what you pay for.  I thought that because the megapixels were high, it would take good pictures.  WRONG!!!!  The photos are out of focus and grainy.  And, since it's April, it's too late to return this thing.  But I should.  I am going to buy my son a new camera.  This was a waste of money!", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Would rate Zero Stars if available", "Author": "TJMJr", "ReviewID": "R3B6TJ355WLR4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Grainy photos, terrible view screen.

If I could, I'd give it zero stars.  I'm also extremely happy that I didn't but this camera, but some poor fool at work did....The pictures are grainy and horrible, and there seems to be no fixing this!  That sentence alone should deter you entirely from purchasing this camera, but let me indulge myself a bit here.  After looking up the owner's manual to see how to focus this thing, I learned that this camera does not have an auto focus.  I can't lie and say that it does not have ANY form of focus, however.  But here's what you gotta do:  you choose between \"macro\" and \"regular.\"  Starts off well enough because that's how most digital cameras are these days, right?  Well, then, you have to position yourself a specific distance away from the subject you're trying to capture because the ridiculous camera has a fixed focal length (well, two fixed focal lengths, apparently).  That's right--you have to move YOUR BODY in order to focus THE CAMERA!This might not sound so bad at first.  People are always moving forward or backward to capture the right shot, right?  Yeah, they do that in order to frame the picture that they want.  Then, they push half way down and AUTO-FOCUS the camera and then take their lovely pictures.  With this camera, you're going to be stuck forever taking photos from either 1 foot away, or more than 4 feet away.  No more cool macro photos from a few inches away of that amazing flower you saw on your trip to Yellowstone.  No more hugging your partner and taking an arms-length photo at the ball game (not if you want it to actually capture both of your faces in full and be in focus).  Of course, none of this matters--none of the photos will be anything better than grainy as a silo, and horrible, horrible, horrible....Do not buy.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst camera ever", "Author": "John Patton", "ReviewID": "R2XTMV3Q7SC3MU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can't get it to take even fair pictures. Noise is so bad you can see it in full sun light. It drains battery so fast they have be left out of the camera. I don't even think that it can be taken apart for parts.
