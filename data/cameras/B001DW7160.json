I don't know what SVP thinks they're doing, but my friend bought one of these cameras for $100 and it was a huge mistake.  Due to the images being interpolated, they all come out fuzzy and washed out.  Why waste money when you can get a Nikon Coolpix L18 or an Olympus FE-310 for the same price, with picture quality that blows SVP out of the water?", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "sucked!!", "Author": "Laura Anschutz", "ReviewID": "R26KQCWFKGGJ6J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "doesn't work...... put batteries in turned on once and died...... can't reach company for replacement!!", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pinhole Camera", "Author": "J. zhu \"Tomorrow a better day\"", "ReviewID": "R3OXYIJHEACBGH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pinhole Camerawell, Look at the lens yourself. This uses a pinhole camera's lens which is very tiny. and I meant it, TINY!!!consider this similar to a low quality webcam. That is the quality you will get. look at the lens before you buy a camera. Conclusion: THIS IS GARBAGE!!!", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "C. A.

The buttons are very tacky and seem cheap.  The camera had bad photo storage.  The camera would only even work every other time it seemed.  The biggest complaint is the delay between photos.  The camera has to \"CHARGE\" between every shot, yea charge I had never seen that before either. I would not recommend this camera to any one. Go with a brand you know and trust. Attempted to return and the company would not even contact me back.
