{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Feature rich and takes beatiful Pics", "Author": "BookWorm620", "ReviewID": "R3L8NWQWUPKCXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is not as good as some you can get in this price range, but it has a few very specific features that make it unique and definitely worth it if you are like me, the only photographer of an active family.I bought it almost solely because of the front LCD screen allowing me to take pictures of myself and other family members, and the Wifi Mobile App that allows me to use my cell phone as the viewfinder and picture taking remote, which allows me in even more pictures, and makes setting up posed group shots very easy.Both of these features work well. There is another App available that allows the camera to send me pictures through Wi-Fi without having to use a computer. Two important things to know about these features is:1)*Update* The apps are now available to everyone in both Apple and Android Appstores.But Samsung advised me they do not guarantee it to work with non-samsung phones.2)As with all apps they can be hit and miss, and sometimes take a few tries to get connected and working. They don't come with instructions, you just have to figure them out.I have tried fiddling with the settings myself, but since you cannot change shutter speed, only ISO and Metering, I was not pleased with any of the results. I get the best pictures on Auto-Mode, which is good news for people who don't want to have to think about settings. As long as it had decent light the pictures are always rich and sharp.The video shot was very good too although the voices seem a bit muted.I had heard bad thing about the battery life, but I find it a bit better that 2AA's I've used in previous cameras. The stock battery fully charged lasts me a whole family party and that's with a mix of pictures and videos. If your worried about battery life I picked a spare online for $15.My Recommendation: If the front LCD is not important to you I would go for theSamsung WB150F 14.2-megapixel Digital Camera. It has the same Wi-Fi  and specialty picture features and twice the optical zoom. It is 14mp vs 16mp, but that really won't make a difference in your pictures.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Missing a key feature", "Author": "Persephone", "ReviewID": "R1R07ZD7IG6B9O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am not interested in Wi Fi capabilities---what I want is a good camera that performs well and is compact and easy to carry.  (I have a big honker with fancy lenses, etc if I want that.)  It is missing something very important:  the ability to snap a photo quickly.  The shutter lag is *terrible*---unless the subject is a statue and doesn't move, I miss shot after shot.  Add a flash and it gets even worse.  Even my old 2003 Sony Cybershot does better in this.  What good are all these fancy features when such a basic one is missing?I am about to give up on this and get something else, even though it's only 4 months old.  I am going to an event tonight and can't risk missing the shots, so am taking the old Sony instead.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Samsung DV300F - The Social Media Camera", "Author": "Tron \"Steven Thomson\"", "ReviewID": "R2E9SYJNRRFLJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What you get in the Package: (1) Lithium Ion Battery (1) Micro USB/USB cable (1) Outlet [connects to the USB cable so you don't need a laptop to charge your Camera] (1) One Year Warrenty (1) Samsung DV300F Dual View Smart Camera (1) Software Disk that includes:  - Intelli-Studio  - PC Auto Back Up (essentially it gives your PC software to send photos wirelessly to your wi-fi enabled laptop or desktop)  - Adobe Reader  - User ManualThe Samsung DV300F is a brilliant little camera from Samsung.  It's 16 megapixel resolution creates pictures with stunning details and with it's large amount of on board features offer a great camera experience for beginners and those seasoned camera pros.  The interface resembles that of a smart phone.  You need only swipe the little zoom knob (located on the top of the camera around the capture button) to navigate different windows.  the user can swipe between several options on the camera including: Basic, Wi-Fi, Scene, Magic, and Album.Basic's Menu (the default screen you'll see when starting it up)------------------------------------------------------------------------|You'll notice that there are 4 types of capture modes: - Smart Auto (Picture) - Smart Movie - Program (Picture) - MovieThe Smart functions are for those interested in getting a quick shot with the camera.  The camera will auto adjust to take the perfect photo of what ever your pointing at.  Smart movie does the same thing but for things your taking video of.  Normal mode (Program and Movie) allows users to hand tweak settings for more personal and optimized features.  What I like is that the camera gives you the freedom to adjust little things with the photo's and video you take but at a moment's notice when you need to snap a quick pic, you can switch to Smart Auto/Movie and catch it with out struggling with the menus.The Basic Menu also houses the Scene option (handy to quickly switch between various natural conditions and areas), Live Panorama (takes a series of photos as you slowly rotate from left to right holding down the capture button), and the settings area.Wi-fi's menu------------------------------------------|This is one of the features that make this camera stand out from all the others in the catagory.  It has built in Wifi, which allows users to snap a photo and (when in range of hotspots or personal networks) instantly post them to Facebook, Tumbler, etc.The menu includes:1) MobileLink - Allows you to connect a smartphone to your camera and copy captured photos and videos from the camera to the smartphone (requires app to be downloaded to phone).2) Remote Viewfinder - Lets you preview images from your camera to your smartphone (requires app to be downloaded onto phone).3) Social Sharing - Allows you to upload video/photos to social media sites.4) Email - lets you email photos/video5) Cloud - lets you upload photos/video to a cloud service6) Auto Backup - Allows you to transfer recent photos and videos to a PC wirelessly7) TV Link - Allows you to view photos/videos from other wireless items that are connected to the same network.Things I loved: - The camera has a screen built in on the front, which lets me to take self portraits and photos with friends that I would otherwise need someone else to hold the camera or take blind guesses as to how I looked. - The lens (when not in use) retracts back into the camera automatically when scrolling threw menus and the gallery.  It makes it easier to hold the camera if you've got big fingers.Things I hated: - The camera (when taking video) has a little slit in the upper left hand top of the camera (with the big screen facing you).  If you try to hold the camera you have to navagaite your fingers away from the voice recorder if you want to catch your voice with out it sounding muffled). - When you zoom in while videoing people or items, it makes the sound actually slow down.  So if your taking a video of your petitely voiced girlfriend for something and you zoom in while she's talking, it'll make her voice sound deeper for a few seconds.All in all the camera is an excellent product for those looking for a new camera but don't want to pay new camera money.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Mother's Day Gift", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "RHSIFVDBD2KTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought for my mom who is a grandma of two. Upgrade from her Canon SD powershot. The best features for us so far are:our Pros:-Light weight-thinner than Canon SD powershots-children cartoons in front and can add music playing-do not need to remove microSD. plug the camera into computer. Just remove the wall prong end of the charger and the same chord can be plugged into the computer.-do not need to remove battery. Just plug in the charger into the wall and the chord into the camera.-you can even charge the camera while it's in the provided case.-to add more photo space, we set to 10M, which can fit 1,250 pictures with the 4G included.-If you distance yourself enough, the flash can produce good vibrant colors in auto mode (here auto mode is called Smart mode).-w/o flash, the colors via auto mode are pretty vibrant and accurate. Not too orange or blue, etc.-there's is a dedicated button on top jsut to turn on the lcd in front.-very colorful menu whose options look like iphone app icons. it's not touchscreen as far as i know. other cameras are jsut simple white text menus.Con:-switching from Photo-Video-Children mode is not in one menu. You have to go through tiny menu tabs that are only text. Not as intuitive, but one can get used to it. I was expecting a simpler menu or a switch that goes from photo to video at least. you need to go to the menu to go from photo to video to other modes. Seems like it's market was aimed towards teens and mothers of children.There are many other features we don't need like wi-fi, emailing directly from the camera, tranfering photos from camera to smartphone wirelessly, panoramic merge, color magic, fun distortions, but for our use, it's perfect and great price. So that's why i'd give it a 5 star.This kit comes in ONE box, not separate boxes like one for the camera, one for the SD card, one for the pouch. The kit is shrinkwrapped in one Samsung box.

Not that I'm narcissistic, but... yeah. Anyway, this is definitely the best camera in its class I've seen.The unit is very compact and light, small enough to fit in anyone's pocket. It's not as thin as some of Sony's offerings, but it's a lot cheaper than any of those. It runs on a Li-Ion power pack that has good battery life and charges fast enough. Recharge is via USB. As noted previously, the main draw of this camera is the front LCD, which although not exactly startling resolution does give you enough of an idea what the picture will look like. This enables you to take arm-length self shots and also lets your subjects see what's going on, if they're close enough to see it.The rear panel non-touch LCD is a generous size and very clear even in bright light, and controls are a standard D-pad. There's a small button on the top to activate the front LCD, and the camera button has a standard zoom ring. The camera has a 5x zoom which is okay- not exactly amazing but about what you'd expect from a digital pocket cam.Pictures come out very clear in native 16 MP resolution and it shoots decent 720P video. It's not a video camera, though, and the quality is about what I'd expect from a phone camera. There's no physical camcorder switch so you have to navigate menus to change modes. I didn't buy it to shoot video, so this doesn't really bother me.Included PC software lets you transfer files. This isn't really necessary, as any PC or Mac comes with software that can do this anyway. The camera itself is also wi-fi enabled, which works fine. This lets you email content or upload it to various social services. Good if you don't need to edit anything and just want t make it immediately available to the whole world.There's some apps that supposedly let you transfer files directly to a phone and use the phone to control the camera remotely. I tried both on my HTC EVO 3D, none of them worked. It looks like it's doing something, but it's either insanely slow or non-functional. I did this more out of curiosity than anything else; from what I know of them, neither of these apps would be particularly useful anyway.The camera has some onboard simple editing modes and a few cute features, like things to take jump shots or play little animations on the front LCD to make kids look at it.All in all, this camera does exactly what I want it to do: take great still pictures with a good shutter speed and not break my arm carrying it around. If you're looking for an enthusiast device or a do-it-all camera/camcorder, this isn't it. But then again, nothing in this price range would be good at that.Pros:Takes great stills, little to no delayWifi enabledGood battery lifeVery portable and compactFront LCD is a unique and useful featureCons:Zoom is pretty weakMediocre video qualityApps don't work", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "wow...amazing!", "Author": "Deborah L.

I got it for $100 incl. shipping and tax; but if it's even closer to $150 I'd still consider it a great contender.The front-side LCD is not present in ANY of today's current cameras, which is frustrating when nobody is around and you want to take a picture of yourself and a friend, or just yourself, to remember a moment. Convenience features such as wi-fi connectivity allow you to upload pictures to Flickr or short video clips to YouTube / Facebook, such that you always stay connected and never too far away from your friends.Let's take a look at some pros/cons.Pros:-- Front-side 1\" LCD screen.-- Adjustable lighting profiles for sunny, cloudy, indoor incandescent, etc. (white balance is better for specific shots).-- 720p video recording - with a 32GB card, you can get about 7 hours.-- Battery lasts about 8 hours on a single charge-- Panorama feature is dynamic and flexible to your needs.Cons:-- 16.2MP -- not great for the price (hoping for 18-20MP), but it's a flaw that's worth it because of the pros available.-- Can't do 1080p video recordings. This is unfortunately due to the low resolution on the MP side (16.2MP vs. 18.1MP required for 1080p), but the picture quality is still really good for the cost.-- Sound microphone picks up a lot of background noise if the camera isn't level -- pointing up or down can cause \"static wind\" to get picked up in the background, making it annoying to deal with when editing later on.Overall, this is an awesome point-and-shoot camera for the price. Given the fact that this isn't meant to do DSLR-like things, I'd recommend this for beginner photographers and those who don't care all that much about resolution of pictures, but still care enough about a decent picture to take one. Definitely recommended to those who want to do video recordings.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had to return it", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R1TVHKWRQEU2MZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was excited to try this out, but ultimately had to return it.- The camera is small and light. I charged it up and was able to use it around the home for a day. At least in my house, the photos weren't really that impressive. My old Canon PowerShot A530 5MP took better focused pictures.- The wifi connection was pretty weak. My computers are all on WIFI, in various rooms around my home and all get strong signals. This device constantly lost wifi access - it worked best when I sat beside the router.- I only tried the Google picassa upload which worked pretty badly. I had to (a) give my username/password for gmail for it to connect. Not a fan of the security risks this exposes my account to. (b) it would fail with unknown reasons repeatedly uploading 2-3 photos. Eventually I did get it to work, but it wasn't as easy as I had hoped.- The front screen is awesome. It's hidden and you can't even tell there is a screen unless you power it up. I would guess its novel construction would make it so you don't have to worry about scratching it.With all of this said, last week I stuck it in my bag for a concert.

This camera's coolest feature is by far the front LCD display.  You can't see it in the photo, but just under the Samsung logo on the front of the camera, there is a screen that lights up and allows you to see what's being taken.However, the downside of this camera is the menu.  For a camera that has arrow keys, it basically makes you use every button on it to navigate the device.  Sometimes the arrow keys work, other times you use Home to exit, sometimes you use Menu to exit.  Then, you may have to use the button on top to change screens.  It's really confusing and inconvenient.  I have no idea what Samsung was thinking.The Wi-Fi option is pretty cool.  It allows you to upload photos directly to Facebook, Picasa, Photobucket and Flickr (I think).  You can also upload directly to a phone or a PC for those looking to move photos to newer social networking sites like Vine or Instagram.  It seems to work fairly well and quickly.  I used it with my phone and they had no problems finding each other.  It did require me to download a Samsung app on my phone though.I bought this camera for Mother's Day for my girlfriend and she's not very tech savvy.  It will take tons of explaining to her on how to use the camera simply because Samsung puts little thought into their products when it comes to basic users.The photo takes pretty good photos, 15 megapixels (which no one in their right mind would ever use unless they wanted a wall-sized photo) and 5x optical zoom, which is pretty lame by today's standards.  At $100, I would normally recommend this camera for a basic user, but giving how difficult it is to use, then I can't recommend it for basic users.  If you're a tech savvy person, then you will probably want a camera with more zoom capabilities, so I can't recommend it to you either.I would suggest just waiting on another camera that does similar things.

Some of them are blurry and I have to retake the picture.So that is what I am most disappointed about.  I read all the reviews and was expecting a camera that didn't take blurry pictures.Also, the Zoom doesn't go far.  So if you want to take pictures of things farther than a cars length away, this isn't the camera for you.It is pretty cool how it shows a little cartoon in the Child mode.  But the cartoon is extremely short and repeats over and over.  It gets really annoying really fast.  So if you are taking a lot of pictures of kids, you'll get tired of it quickly.  It needs at least 3 different cartoons to show to make it great.The lighting is slightly off too.  You can take a picture with the flash and it still comes out looking a little dark.  It's not always that way though.  It's a 50/50 chance the picture is going to come out good. My big 14 Mega Pixel camera is a lot better than this one.  But after a year and a half it started having problems that's why I purchased this one.I spent too much money on this camera for it not to work like I was expecting it to.

As others have stated, the camera started having issues within a couple months, slow loading when buttons were pushed, would take forever to actually take a picture, and the zoom lever would jam. I'm so disappointed because I really love the front view, and so does my kiddo (I actually get smiles because he can see himself), but that is the only thing I love and the only thing that's good on this camera for taking pictures of kids. It's impossible to quickly switch back and forth from camera to camcorder so a lot of moments are missed and it doesn't have a burst setting so you get screwed a lot. Also, after taking one picture, it takes forever to process and be ready to take another one. I wish other cameras that allow you to quickly switch from camera to camcorder and have the burst setting would get the dual-view feature, it's pretty handy, but not worth the money when this camera struggles as it does so much.P.S.The I could never get the wi-fi to work.

The front screen is cool, but honestly pretty useless unless you're a selfie junkie. My only complaint is that it is slightly slow. Takes a couple seconds to charge the flash when you turn it on and focus the camera and takes a second or so in between pictures to recharge the flash so if you're a rapid picture snapper or taking quick action shots...this might not be the camera for you.

You can also get apps on your smartphone/ipad to interact with it such as a remote shutter/viewer and to transfer pics.The zoom isnt much but its there. But get to know digital.16mp images look great so use your optical zoom not digital zoom then zoom into and crop your image.The front viewscreen is the main reason i wanted this and separates it from almost all others.
