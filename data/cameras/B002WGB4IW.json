But be aware they sell a 540tvl camera same body color for thirty bucks more and it includes a power supply.  The difference in picture quality is significantly better with the higher res camera.  So much so that we don't use this camera for our bar surveillance,  can't tell what the bartenders pouring and currency being used.  So instead i use these cameras at my house.  For the price, their worth four stars.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "fuzzy night vision, need to purchase seperate power supply", "Author": "Gregory P. Stewart", "ReviewID": "R13UIPTSQF7ETP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK resolution in the day but kind of fuzzy resolution at night. You need a 1.5 mm allen wrench to tighten the bezel down, after screwing the base plate into whatever you're mounting the camera into. You also need to purchase a seperate power supply because the camera requires one but doesn't come with it.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Bubba", "ReviewID": "RM3WZE5PSZE74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera! I have 2 outputs on my dvr: VGA and Monitor. I have it connected to both and the image is very good on both. When the night vision kicks in you can see everything very clearly even in total darkness. So far this is the best low budget camera I have found. I have seen this camera on another site that had an original retail of 192.00. I don't know how true that is but it really does work well and at this price you can't go wrong. I just ordered 2 more from Amazon and then I should be all set.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$209.95", "Features": "1/3\" CCD imager, color DSP image sensor\n420 TV lines high resolution\nBuilt in f 3.6mm IR corrective lens\n28 built-in long range IR illuminators\n12V DC 500 mA power supply included", "Name": "VideoSecu Outdoor Infrared Day Night Security Camera 1/3\" CCD 420 TVL 3.6mm Wide View Angle Lens CCTV Camera for DVR Home Surveillance System with Free Power Supply IRX5 1MC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51L-olGKwuL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002WGB4IW"}}
