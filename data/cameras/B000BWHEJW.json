I am used to mediocrity. :)I was on the hunt for another brand I saw on clearance someplace, and instead the manager showed me this particular model which at the time wasn't due to be on the shelf for another week. The price was the same, so I took a chance.  I loved it!  Took some time to read up on the proper usage, but once I figured things out I was very pleased.  Nice crisp shots; bright flash.  Having the ability to record video (320x200) directly to Quicktime .mov format is a nice bonus that I didn't think I'd use, but I found myself using it once or twice.My only gripe would have to be that you can't charge it via the USB connection.  Instead, they have a dock that you charge it on (sold seperately for another $50), or you can do the battery recharge shuffle. :P", "Date": "December 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Big Bang for little buck", "Author": "Zandra", "ReviewID": "R35XX8OPSUZOTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After buying a Polaroid I-550 for much more and returning it. I thought I was settling on the CD33. I was looking orignally after returning the I-550 at the Kodak Easyshare CW330 or the C340. However, I ended up going with the CD33. This camera is absolutely great! The pictures turn out wonderful and it has many options. You can crop your pictures right on the camera and the software was extremely easy to use. Rechargable batteries are a must along with atleast a 128mb SD Card. The internal memory is great for a backup picture though. This camera for just a little over hundred dollars is a best buy!

By the time the camera is done \"processing\" my baby is usually no longer laughing.  If he's in motion the pictures often come out blurry.  It feels like decades go by between the time I press the button & it captures an image.  Unless you are photographing landscapes I really would not recommend this camera.  Also, if you use it to tape video, there is no sound.  Again, not real useful if my baby is laughing.  This camera also goes through batteries really fast.  I will never buy electronics again without doing more research.  Don't buy this camera, there are much better cameras on the market for comparable prices.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "CD33/C330 Big Bang!", "Author": "StangoDango", "ReviewID": "R25KAMRF2WJ94Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera and it works great.

I loved it...great picture quilty for a 3mp!  Crisp pictures...and easy to use..all until Dec of that same year.  I turned the camera on and I heard a 'pop' noise and it zapped my batteries dead on the spot.  My flash has never worked since then.  The proplem with this was I had no receipt...no box..nothing (all my fault) so Kodak can't do anything without charging me a charge to fix it. I am still able to use it without the flash but not as good quailty for indoors..all my sample pics i posted are without flash.", "Date": "March 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "FIRST AND BEST", "Author": "D.

I can take pictures easily and print them easily. Lots of options, so you do need to read the instruction guide, but if you are hands on like me you can play around with the camera after a read through of the manual. Very small but sturdy.

It has been a great camera!  Pictures seem to come out crystal clear, and even the videos are nice. However I do have a few gripes, and one is that I cannot adjust the image quality mode from High to economy like what can be done on other digital cameras.  Also when I plug the camera into my ibook or PC, I cannot browse the cameras drive like what can be done with other digital cameras.And the last MAJOR gripe is that the video files come out WAY WAY too large!  A minute video seems to be 15MB's!  The videos are very clear, but honestly cannot compare to a videocamcorder.  Unfortunately I lack a digital camcorder, so my analog JVC unit seems to work for know. I lack a capture card on my PC or ibook, but oh well.So what this basicially means for this digital camera, is that when I need to post a video for my website, or email a video I will not be using this digital camera.  My Palm Zire 72 seems to capture okay looking videos (not quite as sharp) but then again the files are TONS smaller!And when I need to videotape a wedding, graduation or some other event I'll use my camcorder.  So basicially this digital camera is caught in the middle, and may not get the kind of use it would, if Kodak figured out a way to get the videos to look sharp, but also low on disk space, as 15 MB a min is just way too large for emailing, nor is 320x240 a comparison to a standard camcorder.Besides these gripes, I have little if any complaints about this camera.  3.1 MP is good enough for me (used a 2.1MP camera for a long time).", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Kodak easyshare camera", "Author": "Kathy Youmans", "ReviewID": "R1KEZ82WQR76U1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Obviously all these cameras have trouble closing the battery door.

It's been a while) for about $120, and I've taken it across the world. In 2007, I had the same lens problem many people have had - The lens got stuck, and wouldn't move. Well, I took the camera apart (I wasn't concerned with any warranty issues, it was a cheap, old-ish camera), and I took an air compressor to the lens area. Well, some dust blew out, I slapped the thing back together, and it's worked ever since.It has a decent picture quality for being so cheap, and it's got a good lifespan if you treat it like a piece of electronic equipment. I've traveled with it through Ireland, England, Germany, Italy, and Japan, and I've never had a problem other than the lens being stuck back in '07. I might add that most of the miles were on the back of a bike, so it's been through some bad weather, sweat, some nasty falls, etc. Never dropped in water though.I have, however, stuck it in an inflated ziplock bag and taken some underwater pictures. Definitely not the best quality, unless the water is REALLY clear, on a bright day.I can't really speak for the included software, or the easyshare features, because I've always just used a SD card, never had to connect the camera to a computer.With some better picture quality, this would be my favorite camera until it died of old age, as it stands now, I'm looking at something thinner, with better picture quality.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "good little camera but battery door is awful", "Author": "Stephens \"shelly\"", "ReviewID": "R38V23LQOLLCWS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera @ walmart for 130 I believe a few months back.  It works great, still works fine, but the battery door doesn't close all the way now for some reason.  I have to use a piece of tape to keep it shut.  It does use a lot of battery very quickly as well.  I am using rechargeables now, and would recommend taking them out after your done taking pictures otherwise the batteries will be dead next time you try to use them.  Not sure why it does that.  The quality is good, especially for a 3.1 MP, and the 10 second timer is a great feature.  I would not recommend it if you do a lot of picture taking though, because of the numerous battery door issues I have come across after searching for a fix for my camera.

The trouble is that the lens mechanism is much too fragile. We had our camera for about six months with no issues. Then one day the lens got stuck in the protracted position when I turned the camera off, and there was nothing I could do to get the camera working again. It just displayed the message \"lens error\". Batteries were not the problem. I even tried it with an ac adapter. Luckily I still had the receipt, so I sent the camera to Kodak and got it back in a few weeks working again. Kodak claims there was nothing wrong with it (yeah, right). Unfortunately, we also bought one of these cameras for my in-laws (back when we were still enjoying ours), but we lost that receipt. So when their lens jammed (within 3 months), we had no choice but to get a new camera.

A. Davis", "ReviewID": "R23W1JS1GSTUTE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the Easyshare CD33 as a Christmas gift in 2005. The camera is a good little intro to digital snapshots, and was apparently designed to be nothing more than that. It's a no-frills camera that takes reasonably clear pictures under the right circumstances, and can easily fit into a coat pocket and operated one-handed. It is not a camera for those who wish to \"upgrade\" or for photo \"geeks.\" The screen size is a little small, but clear, and there are plenty of picture-taking scenarios programmed in. You can also set up for color, BW, or sepia very easily. There is also a macro setting for taking closeups of objects that I have found quite satisfactory. The only drawback is the camera's indoor-lighting quality is less than satisfactory. Anything beyond the range of the flash comes out pretty dark, sometimes even black. I sometimes have to take pictures inside a very well-lit gymnasium, and even then I have to get really close to the sidelines in order for anything to catch the flash. Even if I use the zoom, everything comes out dark.It's a great first-time user's camera, and very easy to get set up out of the box. It's also fine for taking candid shots where the subject is within a few feet, and it works wonderfully in daylight situations. However, if you want to be able to take a lot of bright indoor light photos I would recommend a newer model (I have tested the newer 5 and 6 MP Easyshares and they seem to work great in indoor situations). It's also not good in places like concert venues, bars or clubs. Also, if you're the kind that wants more manual control, this is definately not the camera to choose. The most manual control that is offered is a choice between 3 ISO settings.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.99", "Features": "A full-featured camera for all types of picture taking and sharing\n3.1 MP resolution; 3x optical zoom; 5x digital zoom\n1.5-inch display\nOn-camera cropping feature\nEasy to use, Works with optional EasyShare Printer Dock Series 3 and EasyShare Camera Dock Series 3", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare CD33 3.1MP 3X Optical Zoom Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q68cLUUDL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000BWHEJW"}}
