{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unless you are a sport journalist, I don't think you can go wrong with this camera", "Author": "Sidarta Tanu", "ReviewID": "RN33NJN2WLJYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 10 Megapixel Nikon D40x is targeted for those who want a relatively compact and light camera yet having most of the important SLR features. The D40 is priced reasonably. In my opinion, if you are still considering whether to get a point and shoot camera or a DSLR, the D40x will be a better choice than any point and shoot camera. But if you are already deciding to get a DSLR or you want more control of the picture taking experience, then I would recommend you to also test the D50, D70s and/or D80 first before deciding to buy the D40x (or the D40). I want you to make sure that you know what you will get (and not get) with the D40x. Don't get me wrong though, the D40x is an awesome camera, and I don't think you will regret buying one. There are some limitation with the D40x which shouldn't bother most people, for example, the D40x doesn't have dedicated button to change picture quality, white balance or ISO settings (which generally only professional/enthusiast will care). Once you understand (and accept) its limitation, the D40x is a potent and exciting photography machine.Just like all its (DSLR) siblings, the D40x powers on instantly and take pictures with almost no shutter lag which are the major advantages of a DSLR over a point and shoot camera. In addition to the P,S,A,M mode, the picture quality of the auto settings (auto, child mode, landscape etc) are also very good. With 3 frames per second you can capture movement progress in sports like football, basketball, baseball etc. Also great to photograph your family or child (child mode). The D40x is a great all around camera.Some notable new features:1. Auto (no flash) mode. Without this mode the flash will pop-up (on all other pre-programmed mode) even when you don't want to use flash (which can be annoying). The internal flash will not pop up automatically with the P,S,A,M settings.2. In camera editing capability such as black and white, sepia and some filter effects etc. While sounds gimmicky, these features are useful especially for those who doesn't have Adobe Photoshop (or other image editing software).3. 10.2 Megapixel sensor for 3782 X 2592 on large image size settings. This is enough to print larger than 13 X 19 Inch.4. 3 frames per second (vs 2.5 for D40)To date, D40 and D40x are the smallest and lightest among all the Nikon DSLR (even smaller than the Canon Rebel XT/XTi, however the D40 and D40x is more ergonomics). I believe that choosing a camera that fits comfortably with your hands is important. Therefore, I recommend people to test the camera before buying (even if you want to buy online, please do go to a physical store and test the camera first whenever possible).The D40/D40x has only 3 (horizontal) autofocus point (5 for D50 and 11 for D80). If you know \"The Rule of Thirds\", the additional AF points above and below the center focus point (available in D50 and D80) are handy to help create the horizontal third line. However, the 3 horizontal AF point in D40/D40x is still helpful to create the vertical third line. Also one can focus with the middle AF point and after the focus is lock then move the frame upwards/downwards to create the horizontal third line. Just make sure the exposure level is still accurate when you move the frame after you lock the focus.About the 18-55mm II AF-S kit lens: A good lens producing sharp photos (though not a very fast lens). Also decent for close-up/macro photography. Lens uses internal focus technology and focusing operation is silent. A very decent kit lens.Lens compatibility: Notice that with D40/D40x, autofocus function will not work for non AF-S/AF-I lens. If you already have non AF-S/AF-I Nikon lenses and want a backup or replacement camera, you will be better off buying D50, D70s or D80. If you buy the D40, it will be convenient to stick with AF-S and AF-I type lenses. I'm not sure why Nikon choose this route for the D40/D40x (whether to enable smaller size camera or from now on Nikon will only make AF-S lens compatible camera). There are a lot of good Nikon AF-S lenses (price range added: low, medium, high) that are fully compatible with the D40/D40x such as:- Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S (M)- Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5G ED IF AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S DX VR (M)- Nikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX (L)- Nikon 55-200mm f4-5.6G ED AF-S DX VR (L)- Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR (M)- Nikon 12-24mm f/4G ED IF AF-S DX (M)- Nikon 17-35mm f/2.8D ED-IF AF-S (H)- Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX (H)- Nikon 28-70mm f/2.8D ED-IF AF-S (H)- Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR (H)- Nikon 105mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Micro (M)- And several other expensive prime tele/zoom lens like 200-400mm, 300m, 400mm, 500mm, 600mm.High priced lens ($1000+) are usually pro level lens which usually have better construction, faster (f-stop), and produce better quality picture. However, often times, lower price lens will serve your needs just fine. I think it is important to know what you want to use the camera for before deciding which camera and lens to buy.Image quality of the D40x is very good which is #1 factor that I look for in a digital camera.Here are the pros and cons of the D40x in my opinion:Pros:1. Nice out of the camera result picture quality2. 10.2 Megapixel sensor3. Compact size and light weight4. Large and bright 2.5 inch LCD5. 3 frames per second6. B/W, Sepia, several more in-camera editing features.7. Instant power on, fast autofocus and no shutter lag8. Noise is acceptable at high ISO settings. Auto ISO settings available.9. Great battery life (500+ on a single charge. 1000+ if flash is not used).10. Auto (flash off) mode availableCons:1. No direct button to change QUAL, WB and ISO settings2. Grip comfortably but might be a bit too small for some people3. No top LCD and no front command dial4. Autofocus will not work with non AF-S or non AF-I lenses (such as the 70-300m G and 50mm f/1.8D lens)5. No AF/MF switch (have to use the switch on the lens)6. Only 3 autofocus point7.8. No night landscape mode in pre-programmed settings9. 1/200 flash sync (which is slower than D40's 1/500)10. No depth-of-field preview buttonComparing D40x with the D40.  I personally prefer the D40 over the D40x due to only minor improvement on the D40x. If you will do a lot of cropping and print larger than 13 X 19 Inch then it might make sense to get the D40x, otherwise use that $200 (price difference) to invest in SB-400 flash or better/more versatile lens (such as upgrading the kit lens to 18-70mm AF-S or 18-200mm AF-S VR or add the 55-200mm AF-S VR zoom lens).  If you shoot sports or fast action (in continuous/burst mode) and need more than 3 frames per second then get the D200 with 5 FPS. For enthusiast, 2.5 FPS (D40) or 3 FPS (D40x) is good enough in my opinion.In conclusion, the D40x is perfect for those who want high quality pictures, more control (than a point and shoot camera), and have a DSLR experience (instant power on and no shutter lag), without having to carry a bulky camera. And unless you are shooting sports/actions professionaly (which faster focusing processor, faster frames per second and larger memory buffer might be needed), the D40x is pretty much all you will need.Happy Photographing!Sidarta Tanu", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not for Soccer Moms, Sports Shooting, Others will Love It.", "Author": "Baltimore Jack", "ReviewID": "R32YEY9J8MXXNO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D40x is a hard camera to rate because for some, it will be a 5 star camera, but others will regret their decision to buy this camera. If you are in the 5 star group, you will LOVE the D40x. But . . . because of a decision Nikon made to save $$$ by leaving out an autofocus driver out of the camera body, if you want to add a lens to shoot your kid playing soccer, the D40x is a potentially bad choice, and you may be a dead man walking. Let me explain:The 5 Star buyer:If you are moving up to a digital SLR, and want nothing more than to use the kit lens (which is very good), then you will LOVE this camera: it is light, feels good in the hand, and puts out better looking JPEG files than the more expensive D70 and D50 cameras, and rivals the D80 at half the cost. At 10.2 megapixels, there is plenty of resolution to crop and still have a great image to print.Also, this is a very light weight camera which feels great in the hand, and is extremely easy to set up and use.Digicam upgraders will love the ability to shoot at 3 frames per second, meaning you can set up the camera to take multiple exposures if you hold down the trigger.  Digital exposures are free, so shooting in this manner gives you a better chance of hitting the perfect shot when photographing the kids.If you intend to use this camera for general travel and around-the-house kid pictures, the D40x is a GREAT choice, and I think you will be a very, very happy camper.The 2 Star buyer:You want a camera for sports or telephoto shots of nature/birding. This is not the camera for you, and here is why: the D40x has a DIFFERENT lens mount than every other Nikon DSLR which came before it. To save costs, Nikon left an autofocus driver out of the camera body, which means you must buy special/more expensive add-on lenses with the autofocus driver built into the lens itself.Why is this significant? Because of the 200 lenses made for Nikon DSLRs by Nikon, Sigma, Tokina, and others, only 20 or so work with the D40x with autofocus - something most amateurs will need to shoot sports and day to day photos. Many of Nikon's own consumer grade lenses, such as the 70-300mm G Zoom (Street price $150), will not autofocus with the D40x. As a practical matter, this means that if you want an autofocus lens to shoot junior playing soccer, you must spend $515 for a zoom lens, the fantastic, yet pricey Nikon 70-300mm VR Zoom. That is almost as much as what you paid for the camera itself.Now, to be fair, Nikon has also introduced the $250 (street) Nikon AF-S DX VR 55-200 mm lens, but that lens (1) will not give you the reach you will want to shoot sports, (2) is a tad slow autofocusing for sports, and (3) the lens speed will limit you to shooting on fairly bright days.The D40x is significantly limited in the number of lenses it will accept, and you really need to think about these limitations before purchasing. Moreover, what if your intentions change and want to pick up a cheap zoom for occasional use? With the D40x, you can't (cheapest compatible lens is $250), and I really think this is a significant limitation on this camera. That said, if Nikon sticks to this mount, the lens manufacturers will (over time) follow, so 2 years from now, there may be a wealth of new lenses for this mount.But hey, if you are in group 1, this is a 5 star purchase, and you will be a very happy camper.

I agree with most positive reviews: this is a very fast, light, easy to use DSLR with a great battery life.The D40x is a very good camera, and a good choice as long as you do not have a large collection of old Nikon lenses. As many other reviewers have noted, this camera only autofocuses with Nikon AF-S or Sigma HSM lenses. (In Nikon-ese, \"AF-S\" means \"has a built in motor to focus.\" \"HSM\" means the same thing in Sigma-speak.) Unless you take lots of shots of inanimate objects, you'll probably find manual focus a huge inconvenience. Luckily, there are a good selection of AF-S lenses. Sigma makes a fixed-focus 30mm f1.4 lens if you need to take indoor pictures without a flash; Nikon makes a fantastic selection of other lenses. Don't worry about this limitation unless you already have a lot of Nikon lenses.However, when I bought this camera a few months ago, I was faced with an important question: which lens should I buy with this camera? Amazon offers at least four different options: (a) body only, (b) body plus Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Nikkor Zoom Lens, (c) body plus Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Nikkor Zoom Lens and 55-200mm f/4.5-5.6G ED AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens, and (d) body plus Nikon 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. What is a buyer to do?I went with option (b), and later bought the extraordinary Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF AF-S VR DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens. Today, I might buy the body alone. Let me explain why:When I bought the camera, the difference in price between options (a) and (b) was about thirty dollars. I felt that it was certainly worth that amount of money to get a small, light general purpose lens. This way I could buy the camera, figure out how I wanted to use it, and upgrade lenses later. You can certainly take some very good pictures with the cheap kit lens, and you may like having a fast-focusing, lightweight zoom lens anyway.I considered option (c), the two lens package, but decided against it for two reasons. First, Nikon makes two 55-200mm zoom telephoto lenses: the one included in this kit, and a second version with vibration reduction. The VR version is only slightly more expensive.  I find that VR is an essential feature in a long zoom lens; it helps a lot in taking long distance shots that stay in focus. Furthermore, because of the way this kit is priced, you may find that it is actually cheaper to buy the body and lenses separately!I also considered option (d), but decided against this after reading reviews of the Nikon 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens. Reviewers were often disappointed with this lens.So, in a nutshell, here is my advice to prospective buyers:(a) Check prices, carefully. Sometimes, the kits are great deals. Sometimes they are not.(b) The cheapest kit lens is a great lens for the price, but not a great lens. It focuses quickly, and it's very light, but the zoom range is a little short and it has some significant optical flaws.(c) If you can afford it, get the Nikon 18-200mm lens. It's better than any of the lenses that are included in the kits.(d) Consider a cheap lens kit and a flash like the Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. If you take lots of indoor pictures, a bounce flash will do more for your pictures than a pricier lens. (Incidentally, I love this flash: it's small and light, and the battery life is terrific.)(e) I decided to buy the cheapest body available and more expensive lenses. Cameras, unfortunately, have turned into computers: they are replaced by new models that are twice as good every 18 months. Lenses, on the other hand, have not. Spend your money on lenses, not cameras.(f) There are good reviews of lens options on different web sites. In particular, check out [...] who did a review comparing all the Nikon kit lenses.

Trade-offs for the smaller size are a less powerful battery and a smaller viewfinder.Another strong feature is the editing you can do in the camera itself after you've taken the picture.  This is truly handy if you're on the road but need to make some prints for clients or family.Compared to the slightly more expensive Canon XTi, the D40x's AF system is a very simple 3-point system vs. 9-point for the Canon.  Since focusing a metering are also tied together, this might give the Canon an edge in more difficult lighting situations.  Additionally, the Canon offers a sensor cleaning feature lacking on all Nikons.  The Canon, however, does not have the editing featues of the D40x.  These two will be joined at 10mp, very small DSLR, by the Olympus Evolt E-410.The only catch for the D40x is that it does not feature a focusing motor inside the body.  That pretty much limits your selection of autofocusing lenses to some Nikon and a few Sigma lenses today.  Nikon's own 55-200 VR is a terrific value, if it's enough range, but there are no $200 AF 75-300 zooms that will work in autofocus today.  If you have older Nikon AF lenses, you might look at the larger but superior D80, which still features the motor in the body.A very nice, small DSLR, at a very reasonable price.

You should try the same test, after all you are spending a fair amount of money and probably intending to keep the camera for awhile. In the past, I have owned both Nikon and Canon cameras, and usually judge them about the same. I would strongly suggest that you purchase the 55mm-200 lens for this camera. After owning this camera for about two months I would tell you I am very satisfied with it in every way, picture quality, weight, feel, and performance.

Before I go on, I must say that the D40x is a really brilliant camera for the price you pay.  The kit lens that comes with the camera, though plasticky, is a also great performer!Most reviews would tell you all that it can do, but here, I'll tell you more about what it cannot do that I would like it to have.  You can read other reviews on all the functionality and great stuff the D40x has.1. It is limited in the types of lenses it can use for auto focusing, i.e. the AF-S lenses.  Because Nikon took a focusing motor out of the camera body (which makes it lighter), it now needs lenses which has an internal focusing engine.  The Nikon range with this is the AF-S lenses.This would mean that you cannot use the AF or AF-D lenses for auto focusing.  It can still do metering, but not auto focusing.  Tokina (at the writing of this review update) do not make lenses that can auto focus on the D40/x cameras, and Sigma has a HSM range that can work, and Tamron released in 2008 some lenses that have in-built motor that can auto focus with the D40/x camera.  These AF-S lenses are more expensive, so you may spend less on the body, but more on the lenses, unless you are satisfied with the kit lens or the lower range of Nikon DX lenses.The AF-S fast lenses (i.e. lenses with large aperture) are very expensive.  Hence, one of my gripes is that I cannot fully use the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 or f/1.4 lenses on this camera.2. It cannot support auto bracketing.  In the Nikon web page, the specifications for the auto bracketing looks misleading.  When I searched for it, I found out that it does not support it.  Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) takes a number of consecutive shots at different exposures (e.g. -2EV, 0, +2EV) and when you go home, you can do a post processing on these 3 shots.  This is the same for Auto White-balance Brackting (AWB) where it takes multiple shots with different white balance settings.This means that to do bracketing, you would need to do it the old fashioned way of taking one shot, change the settings, take another shot, change the settings, then take a 3rd shot.  By doing this manually, you are more prone to error or shifting the camera when you make the manual adjustments.Why do you want such a feature?  Basically, imagine a picture of a great blue sky and a clear foreground of a subject you are taking.  Without different exposures, you would either get the blue sky you want but a drak foreground subject, or a right exposure of the foreground but not the blue sky you want.  The 3 pics taken in the bracketing allows you to do post processing on Photoshop to join the 2 exposures together.3. The white balance adjustments are presets with +/- 3 for each preset.  It does not support the kelvin color temperature scale in manual white balance adjustment.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "A. Malamud", "ReviewID": "R2CD0QK1IVH2AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the D40X in Israel since Amazon will not ship it outside of the US (still can't understand why).I went for the kit (18-55) and added the AF-S 55-200 VR and the tiny yet impressive SB-400 flash.I was instantly amazed: perfect colors, always in focus (and I mean always, even in zero light conditions), fast, easy and most of all, fun!Many friends asked me why I bought this model instead of the D40 - claiming that these two cameras are exactly the same (since more MP don't make a difference).So here are the main reasons:1. MP can make a difference, when you crop pictures. I must say that sometimes my compositions are not exactly exquisite (yeah...they sometimes suck...) so I need to crop pictures to make them look as I want them to. the extra 4 mp can make that difference (and they already did for me!)2. The D40X lowest ISO is 100 (200 for the D40). Again, not a big difference. However, ISO 200 may sometimes result in overexposure of white surfaces while the rest of the picture looks just great and that is so annoying!! I checked both sensitivity settings and 100 just looks better. Furthermore, why did Nikon decide to change this feature? I am sure that it has something to do with feedback they received from customers.3. It's newer than the D40. Yes, people may say that I am a victim of good marketing, but I strongly believe that Nikon released this version with improvements based on usage.I don't write Pros and Cons since I can't compare this camera to anything else at this level and price.Go get yourself one, you just can't go wrong.Avi", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Shame on Nikon Too", "Author": "Richard Stromberg \"Photo Buddha\"", "ReviewID": "R1VZX4XJSZ91UW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned, and still own Nikon equipment since 1965.

While on the shuttle train to my gate it was on my shoulder on the seat.  When the train stopped, I jumped off with my laptop, but the camera bag had slipped off onto the seat - I didn't notice the weight change on my shoulder.  As the door was closing, I saw my camera drive off in an empty train to pick up more travellers.  $3000+ in camera gear soon to be in the hands of a new owner :-(  I called Lost and Found, but let's face it - it's gone for good.  Oh well - I make good money, and it's just 'stuff' - what else can you do, ya know?  I can only say I'm glad I didn't have my GPS, point-and-shoot, 700p  PDA cell phone and car keys in the same case like I normally do when I travel (I fly a lot).  This one day, all the other stuff was in my laptop case.Soooo.... today I bought the Nikon at Costco in a 2 lens kit for about $970.  I fully knew it wasn't the pro grade that my Canon was.  But I just wanted to 'get back in it' as I take a LOT of photos for work and pleasure.The D40x takes GREAT photos - but I quickly found a few limitations that I have not seen posted.  There is no direct entry for color temperature.  Since I shoot semi professionally, and use a color temperature meter on a regular basis, I feel this is important.  With the Nikon, you can only set the 'lighting type' - outdoors, tungsten, flourescent, etc.  No direct entry of color temp in Kelvins.  Also, there is no instant access to ISO - another important feature the D40x lacks.  There is no external sync PC connection for pro flash gear (I use Novatron flash packs in manual mode).  You have to buy a hot shoe adapter to get this - no biggie, but it's more money and not included.But I will say it's WAY faster than the Canon D20 was - very quick to start, and no lag between shots.  The ergonomics are better in some ways - it's WAY lighter, but a little small.  There's no LCD on top, and only one encoder wheel (which limits how many changes you can make quickly).  The built-in editing and such are fine if you want that stuff in the camera.  I don't - I use Photoshop and do all that stuff on the computer.  Also, I normally shoot RAW + Large JPEG - the D40X only allows RAW + 'basic' JPEG - you cannot do 1:4 large JPEGs and RAW at the same time - I consider this a limitation, as it means I must do the conversion in the computer instead of just dumping both formats onto the editing disk.  For point and shoot, it isn't an issue.I think it's a great semi-pro camera - if you are looking for a GOOD 'point and shoot' this might be the ticket.  If you are looking for a GOOD  DSLR, I'd go for the Nikon D80 instead.  I chose the D40X on the thought that next year, the D80 class will be 20 Megapixels, and I'll just hang on until then to move back into a pro-class DSLR.  So my issues really relate to the fact I didn't want to jump right back in with another $3000 to get to where I was on Tuesday.  I did NOT expect the D40x to be pro grade - it's a VERY good camera for what it is.Oh, and if you happen to have 'found' a Canon D20 camera and bag on a train to the south terminal of the Seattle airport on May 22 at 7:30 AM, I'll happily give you a VERY generous reward for returning it to me :-)", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very good 1st dSLR camera...", "Author": "Arun \"Techie\"", "ReviewID": "R2KQG6082LRSP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Going from using point-and-shoot digicams to the D40x is a nice 1st step.

The differences with the D40 may be minor but the 10 Megapixels surely will benefit those who tend to crop pictures later, as I do. The 18-55 mm lens that I got with the camera is limiting. I take a lot of close-up shots so its fine now but I already have my eyes set on the 55-200 AF-S DX VR Lens.The built in tools make the D40x very easy to use and quite intutive.

I got myself a 2GB Kingston Ultra which works like a charm.

You are looking at upgrading from a point-N-shoot. Or,  b. An intermediate to advanced photographer looking for a decent backup camera. Since I have owned this camera, I have been doing a lot of shooting with a friend of mine who happens to do photography for a living. My friend uses a Fujifilm S3 pro dSLR. Let me tell you, there isn't much difference in picture quality between the $700 d40x or $2,300 S3 pro when using the same lens. Both cameras are capable of producing almost identically amazing pictures. The main difference is when buying the d40x, you can get about the same quality photos for more than 3x cheaper than an average pro-level SLR camera.If there was one thing I would do over again, I would definitely buy the d40x as a camera body only. Not that the kit lens is bad, but it's rather limiting to your d40's potential.  Having the chance to use Nikon's 18-200mm VR lens has made me a real believer of how important a really good lens is for great photography.My only major gripes about the d40x is the lack of adjustment buttons and no aperture dial the higher end dSLR's have. It can be somewhat annoying having to go into the camera's menu screen to make simple adjustments.The PRO's for sure outweigh the few CON's this camera has. It's a great dSLR camera to start out with.

I'm very new to photography and I didn't exactly know what I was buying exactly, I thought Olympus camera seemed simple enough for me to use and was a great price. After shopping for a camera for over 4 months, I ordered the evolt500. What a mistake!  The camera took less than stellar photographs and was larger and looked like an older model camera with little to no modern edges. They were good but not WOW. After a few days of use, the Olympus began malfunctioning by shutting down randomly and the lcd screen would static. I shipped that back and amazon was wonderful enough to reimburse me for my shipping when the vendor didn't.Side Note: and another thing. I feel better when I purchase from Amazon as opposed to the other vendors. I may pay more (like I did for my Nikon d40x) but I think it's money well spent when I know that is something goes wrong past the first 15 days, my expensive investment is protected by someone other than the warranty.On a whim, I ordered the Nikon d40x. I had read the reviews and even walked over to best buy to test it out the camera. I still wasn't sure about the camera or what to expect. As soon as my camera arrived today (thanks, Amazon!) I opened the box and starting shooting. The pictures are amazing! Clear, crystal, sharp, and beautiful.

Plus, you get a large preview screen and extensive \"in camera\" editing features that allow a wide range of post-shot manipulation if you don't have access to your PC. Just amazing... everything, plus a huge amount more, that I got from my previous SLRs.Could it get any better? Well yes, because the stock Nikon autofocus zoom lens that comes with the camera (rated at 18-55 mm new digital style and equivalent to a just about perfect 26-83 mm old style) is now matched with Nikon's new, low cost, autofocus DX VR lens (rated at 55-200 mm new digital style and equivalent to 83-300 mm old style) which really does cut out camera shake to allow genuine \"point & shoot\" at its higher focal lengths. In other words, for a total cost of well under \u00a3600 I got a stunningly powerful and flexible camera plus a \"tripod-less\" combination of two lightweight autofocus Nikkor lens covering a full 26-300 mm range... which is nothing short of sensational for any \"old style\" SLR user like me.SLRs are a different world from compact cameras - you definitely can't fit them in your pocket - but for anyone wanting to move up to a higher level for not much more, or for anyone wanting to rediscover the lost joys of their SLR past at an incredibly cheap entry price, the Nikon D40x is a \"must have\" option... certainly it's got one more very happy user.", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Be Aware of Autofocus Limitation", "Author": "D.

Nikon seems to have the best lenses on the market.7) Takes an SD card-- the Canon takes a CF card. SD cards are cheaper for the same GBs8) Nikon has a better warranty situation and I heard they are very customer oriented.9) Nikon name is legendary in photography, and has the best and most easily available equipment.10) For $975 (several purchases on Amazon), I got the following: D40x with 18-55mm lens, 55-200mm VR (vibration reduction lens), Nikon ballistic bag, extra battery (2 total), Nikon guide to photography, 2GB Sandisk Extreme III SD card, Sandisk USB card reader, (2) different Nikon Lens protective padded pouches, Nikon Microfiber lens/screen rag, Nikon Pen style brush lens cleaner, Digital Recovery Software, and Digital Photo Editing Software.

I did consider the D40 which is a 6MP (the D40X is a 10MP) but opted to spend the extra cash and get the beefier of the two. The only differences between the two is other than the mega pixels is that the flash sync is 1/500 on the D40 and 1/200 on the D40X, the D40 has a frame rate of 2.5fps and the D40X has a frame rate of 3fps and the lowest ISO on the D40 is 200 and 100 on the D40X. The picture quality is excellent. I would highly recommend getting the Nikon SB-600 flash with this camera. Using this flash and bouncing it off the ceiling greatly reduces or eliminates the harsh shadow that the pop-up flash which is included with the camera creates.I bought the D40X with the 18-55mm lens. I also bought the Nikkor 55-200 lens that is compatible with this camera. In my opinion, I think the optimum lenses to have would be the 18-135mm and the 70-300mm. Of course this will greatly increase the cost, but the 18-55 doesn't have much range and it would have been nice to get that extra distance that the 18-135 would give.

Although it will accept older Nikkor lenses, they WILL NOT AUTOFOCUS unless they are an S type with CPU contacts (AF-S or AF-I). Contrary to what customers have heard (and I get these questions frequently,) there is no firmware update that will fix this issue! The camera does not have a focusing motor to drive older style AF lenses; these lenses require a little pall on the camera to connect with a slot on the lens to move the focus elements. All lenses must have a silent wave motor or equivalent in order to focus with this camera.

I couldn't afford to buy a high end professional camera but I wanted excellent image quality. I found the interface user friendly. It's fantastic as a first DSLR purchase, because you won't be overwhelmed with an array of features that higher end models have that a beginner probably wouldn't understand or use. I found the quality of my images stepped up when I purchased better quality DX lenses. I have an 18-200 VRII 3.5 and a 35mm 1.8. Both worked very well with the d40x camera body. Within my 8 years of using it, I have shot my photography assessments, a lot of glamour portraiture and assisted wedding photographers and found it to be adequate. I did try and use it for live theatre and it was a little tough. It doesn't have the high ISO sophistication of the newer Nikon models and was a bit noisy. I think a better camera body would be better for live action shots with fast lenses and low light live theatre.I'd like to mention that I am pretty clumsy and I have dropped this camera too many times than I would like to admit, but it has withstood all it's falls and functioned at full capacity. I would recommend this DSLR to people who are getting started in digital photography. Learn how to use this wonderful camera with all it's features. Spend a few years getting to know it on manual.

It is an excellent camera. I read through several of the reviews here and wanted to add some comment to some things brought out. Although I am not a professional photographer I do work with digital cameras and have for several years. The D40x is a great choice for people who want the advantages of an SLR camera without some of the pitfalls of such - cumbersome, covered with buttons and requiring multiple settings, etc. just to take a picture. The camera is an advanced technology with its quiet shutter, noiseless focus and great menu system that toggles you through basic settings quickly - ISO, picture quality, white balance (if needed)  You do not need to search around for separate dedicated buttons to set these settings. Users know where to go - the toggle. IF YOU leave it on the first menu set known as shooting menu, switching any of these settings is about 3 button presses to your choice of action. Those who noted the lens issues and no sports pic shooting, eh, the camera shoots quickly and it is instantly active upon switching power. If you have a lot of Nikon lenses then perhaps the D80 is best and obviously you are more than an average camera user. Do not be concerned about lens availability though. Something else not mentioned is that many of the DX lenses also have VR or vibration reduction.  Finally the lack of a depth of field PREVIEW is interesting. I did a search on the internet to actually find out what the importance of such a thing was and found two very detailed descriptions. Basically, according to the first website, \"few professionals consider the DOF tool in their arsenal...it is rarely used and often criticized for seemingly making the picture appear darker. It can however allow for a preview of creative shots that make your subject pop and all else seem  unimportant\"  Hmm. Professionals rarely use it? Why then is it so critical on a camera? Further reading and I realized that this feature's purpose is to set the aperture to what you see in the view finder prior to taking the picture. This seems odd though considering the advantage of seeing shots in a viewfinder and also having aperture priority mode AND automatic modes to compensate for such  tedious work. Professionals may scoff at my description but the point is that unless you are a professional wanting a highly specific tweak on your depth, this camera will do it. The other website I found had a movie showing the advantage of a depth of field preview. The DOF description was the same except the example was a woman standing in the woods. The woman was focused and the background blurred. All while showing how to press the DOF button while looking through the viewfinder, focusing and shooting. With the D40x you can accomplish the same effect faster by turning the knob to portrait and snapping the picture! You can still work at it if you want with the aperture priority setting. Everything is visible from the viewfinder. I just wanted to bring these important points out because this really is a good camera and when things are mentioned that most people do not know what it is other than \"this camera is really missing something\" then they check it off their list. The automatic settings on the camera produce fantastic results and are what most people would use anyway.

In terms of simple ergonomics, the Nikon's grip is incredible, compared to the somewhat awkward grip on the Canon.  Quality is identical.  The thing that really separates the two, though, is the UI.

The resolution on this camera is fantastic and the lens is very good. The picture quality is really very high quality. The reviews here by others help me select this camera. The reviews helped me choose this camera. I consider this a high end consumer camera but not a professional camera since there is no depth of field feature and other features are buried in menus. I think the intent was consumers will want to point and shoot but if you want to get into being more creative you can do that by getting into the menus. I thought after awhile i could memorize the menuing system and find things pretty well. Summary: I am pleased with the camera.

I can take 3 frames/second, which is a big help for rapid action.  Most controls are easy to get to, but knowing which button does what involves a fairly steep learning curve.On the down side: One display, on the back.  This means that menus can be crowded and it can take a while to find the setting you're trying to change.  While bracketing is easy, it cannot be automated like the more expensive cameras can.It only uses AS lenses.  This may be a temporary problem, but I think is's a minor one.  I have the 18-55mm and will soon add the 55-200mm.  If I want a longer lens, I have to use manual focus until longer AS lenses are produced.  In my case, If I need longer than 200mm (equivalent to 300mm in 35 film cameras), I'm shooting long distances anyway, so I'll focus on the hyperfocal distance and have everything from 20-30 ft to infinity in focus (depending on focal length and f/stop).If I could afford twice the price, I'd probably spend it.

The D40x might be the exception.While newer cameras offer more pixels, few can produce an image as crisp and warm as this Nikon. I own several newer point and shoot cameras in the 16 to 18 megapixel range from Sony and Canon, and still, this D40x produces a photo that stands up or surpasses either of them. The reason is that the Nikon sensor is coupled with very clean electronics. As you enlarge the image on your computer screen, the Nikon image begins to show its pixels more like film grain than electronic artifacts. Other cameras have L shaped jpg artifacts that clearly cry out \"electronic image\". The Nikon has the warmth and grain structure more like Kodak film. Because of this, the image has a nicer look to it than many newer cameras, including Nikon's own D5100 with nearly double the pixels.Another benefit of the D40x is the ability to use SDHC cards up to 32 GIG. The Nikon D50 and other cameras of this vintage are limited to the 2 GIG sized SD cards.

Most of all I am so glad that I chose a DSLR--especially this DSLR over a Point and Shoot digital.  The additional weight/size is well worth the quality you get.-Of all the photo settings, I would say that 80% of my photos are taken in full auto mode.  The other modes that I use regularly but less often are the aperature priority, and macro modes.  Unless you're taking photos of subjects that don't move, then I recommend the auto mode because the photo will be \"gone\" if you're busy fiddling with the controls.-I take a lot of photos of my young nieces, and having no shutter lag lets me have \"What you see is what you get\" photos.-This camera will improve your photography, but the bottom line is that unless you have a good eye, no camera is going to give you great shots.-After owning my D40x for a year I invested in the Nikon sb400 flash.  The increased power/range and the ability to bounce the flash improved flash photos with the D40x by 100% over the quality of the photos with just the built-in flash.  Flash photos look so even and natural, and there's never red-eye.-I use the 18-55 mm  lens far more than the 55-200 mm lens.-The only thing I don't like all of the time is the function of the autofocus.  Sometimes it \"misses,\" and I think that this is because there are only 3 focal points.-I take all of my photos in \"fine\" mode.  This gives me the freedom of enlarging and or cropping later, without sacrificing quality.  I use a 2 gb SDHC card, and have never \"run out\" of space in a day's shooting.  I have not traveled much with this camera, but if I did and was \"on the road,\" I would use a card with larger capacity.-10.2 MP is more than enough--the lens optics are far more important, and Nikon makes fantastic lenses.-Occasionally shooting at ISO 1600 isn't high enough, and I wish this camera had an ISO of 3200.

WHile this camera has only three focus points, and can hunt like a madman in an action situation, and it not weather-proofed, otherwise I have to say it's been quite the trooper, and what worries me is that NIkon has still not made it's replacement.First off, I love the profile and size of this camera. I don't know why Nikon insists on turning out the D3100-3300, and D5100-5300 amateur series only in this small profile, but the D7100 is a lumbering monster in comparison.Secondly, this battery lasts a while, even though one of mine is finally practically leaking. The new batteries are smaller than this one, and the live view screens suck power like crazy.I would like video, but not at the cost of draining the camera. I thought I wanted live view once, but not any more. Well, for concerts, sure, and yes, I do pull my camera down quickly after shooting.Most notable to me, and hopefully the D3300 or D5400 will change this, is the quality of the images. When I got it, I thought this was the first camera that got close enough to Fujichrome for me with polarization of course. B&W; can also be quite fun. It must have a great sensor in it. I checked out the D5100 and the sharpness was negligibly better, but with horrid video-like image rendering, totally uncorrectable, and who wants to correct every image?Anyway, like others have said, if you're not shooting action, this is a good camera.

I am so glad I did.  This is a great camera.  I found the menus to be intuitive to set up the camera to take pictures.  The user's guide is pretty good, although there are a couple of topics which could be more detailed.  The camera itself is lightweight and feels comfortable in my hands when taking pictures.It has a variety of image settings to choose from to get normal shots, soft, vivid, more vivid or even black and white images!Its ISO settings start at 100 and go up to H1 (3200 equivalent) which gives you a wide range of lighting situations to take pictures.  I've taken pictures at all of the ISO settings and found the higher settings have a little 'noise' but it is acceptable to me.One thing to be aware of is the focusing mechanism for the D40x is not in the body of the camera itself but in the lens.  One must be careful which Nikon lenses to buy for this camera if they are interested in automatic focusing.Another 'problem' (depends on how you look at it) is if you take pictures in RAW format, you will either be required to purchase the Capture NX software separately or Adobe Photoshop (the more expensive version which can convert RAW to their DNG format) in order to process the images.  Additionally, I found the Picture Project software that comes with the D40x to be of little use and haven't used it much.Overall, I am very pleased with the quality of the pictures I've taken with this camera.

The greater sharpness was probably due to the larger sensor (at 10.1MP vs 6.0MP), although with the noise reduction on the level of detail was much closer. The things the D40/D40x/D60 lack is buttons on the body itself for ISO, AF-C and others, as well as the external AF motor.

I've had a Nikon F, a Nikon FE and a Nikon Coolpix 4500 (among other brands) over the years. But when my husband decided that HE'D \"like to get back into photography\" and that we ought to get the D40X first, then he'd take it when I was \"ready\" for the D80, I decided that was a good way to go. And I've been thrilled with the choice because it's really the perfect 'entry level' camera for me. While I can hardly wait to move up to the D80, the D40X has been great for both of us. It's a grab-and-go camera he took to grandson's school event and, never having touched it, took some great photos. I've taken some of the best \"people\" pictures of my life--the first week I had it! It's light and small enough for me to take pictures off the back of a Honda ST-1300/Oan-European, one of my favourite things to do. Best of all, SOME of my old Nikkor lenses work with it (most of the others can be modified) so I am using a 20+ year-old 35-135 Nikkor AF Zoom and, even though I have to focus it myself, I find I am taking my best photos with it and often it's the lens on the camera till I get a newer, longer lens. I was truly surprised at how well soccer photos came out--not all in focus because I haven't had to focus a camera for decades! So I just took more shots and threw out all the fuzzies.

We were surprised that you cant use the LCD for framing pictures (I guess that is true for all SLRs?) so it took us some time to get used to using the view finder, but we are happy with that too.Nikon just came out with the D60 which is about a hundred and twenty dollars more. It has some advanced sensor cleaning technology and updated software but I think we still would go with the D40X since these don't seem worth the price. The sensor cleaning is probably only worth it if you change lenses a lot (we only have the one) and thus expose the sensor.

Yes, this means that you have to bracket your shots yourself, but if you're bracketing, you'll probably want a tripod anyway.  For those of you who complain about the lack of AF lenses for the D40x, have you tried MF?  Because in full manual mode, which is why most of us buy SLR's it actually has the highest compatibility with any Nikon F-mount lens, even 40 year old lenses. Another plus is that manual focus lenses are cheaper to buy, and don't drain battery power from the camera body, so you can keep shooting.  Either way, more and more lenses are coming out that have a built-in autofocus motor to AF on the D40x.  I myself mainly use the 135mm f/2.8 and 50mm f/1.8 lensesFor the price, it's a great camera.  It can do anything the D80 can, except for wireless off camera flash.  It's also smaller and lighter, making it easier to carry around comfortably.  As for the \"new\" D60, all it has are some dust reduction features, and a jacked up price tag. Unless you live in a windy/dusty area, or change your lens multiple times every time you use it, it's not really an issue.I've used my D40x for sports shots, pictures of animals/pets, family, night pictures, parties and more.  I'm pleased with the picture quality and it feels great in the hand.  Sure if I had $2000, I'd probably buy something better (more frame per second, or more autofocus points and dedicated buttons), but for $600, you can get this good camera and a couple of good lenses and a flash unit for less than $1000.Here are some pictures I've taken with this camera at the Rose Parade, the Los Angeles Coliseum (yes I am a USC student) and more, so you can look at them and decide if you need a camera that does more.[...]", "Date": "February 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome pictures and easy to use", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3HDWPKM2PC8QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect camera weather your just starting out or a seasoned pro.

You may not think you'll use it to it's full potential -- in the begining , you won't - later you might. At the very least, this camera will make you better at photography, even if you do not move off auto for the first month.Consider the following:With lightning quick response and 3 frames per second & - you get the frame you want. No more tracking in low light, praying your subject stays still long enough to capture that killer shot you saw when you pressed the shutter release. No more cringes when you press the button & an even better shot presents itself while your camera recovers. (my daugther is 2 - you can imagine). It's just - frame up - click, you got it, and repeat as fast as you can or want to..... you can delete them as fast as you take them so relax and focus on content.Picture quality -- no contest. This camera is outstanding. In Auto, it has enough smarts to get a frame which includes color and depth far exceeding any expetations. I am also having fun with the 10.2 MP - zooming and cropping so-so shots into great ones, without losing anything. In other modes, you can easily get more impact (depth of field, exposure, yada, yada), and I have found this camera compensates far better for poor choices by the user than anything I've experienced previously.Ease of use - beyond auto. I am certianly new to this, but I'm finding that this camera is incredibly intuitive for all those features you feared on an SLR. Nikon has done a great job making this camera feel like a small accordian - all functions you need are next to a finger or thumb & useable, so there is no interuption while your playing. It just fits... and the light wieght plus solid grips just inspire confidence.If there was one negative - well - my niece couldn't figure out how to make the zoom work (couldn't find the thumb switch). She also wanted to use the LCD to frame up the picture. What can I say, I'm hoping it's a generational thing, but that was a bit scary considering she is legally an adult.Conclusion - I love it. I have already expanded. I got the SB 400 flashNikon SB-400 AF Speedlight for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, which is a great add. The pop up did well  & the i TTL keeps the light as right as it can. However, when you add the ability to bounce, you get great indoor shots, and you'll wonder why you didn't have this before. Next - I'll get a longer lens. The 18-55 has been flawless & the 10.2 MP allows me to zoom after it's been downloaded - but I can already see I need more reach.Read the others for more technical analysis, but I can say you will not be disappointed by anything with this camera.

Myers \"zanlue\"", "ReviewID": "R1UNI37CGXC1I8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I am a full-time professional photographer. I shoot purely with Nikon, right now I work with a D300, D200, and I use a D70 for around-the-house photos. D70 gives pretty good quality, and to must people(non professionals), superb quality. It isn't quite the quality of the D300, but is much less bulky which is why it is my go-to camera for home.The D40 is really quite terrible in my opinion. If you hope to do anything besides shoot auto, you are out of luck, things like ISO, F-stop, and speed are all inside the camera's menu, rather than being on the upper user screen like the other D50 and up. They are trying to sell you on the higher megapixels. Go to: [...] to read about the megapixel myth that camera companies are trying to sell you on. I started out shooting professionally with a D50, and I was able to blow it up photos up to 11x14 for photos of people, and I actually have a two foot by 4 foot landscape canvas from that camera that did not pixelate.The camera takes okay pictures, but you'll get better ones and more options from the D50 or D70. The ONLY thing that the D40 offers, and should not be the deciding factor, is that it gives you a pretty large lcd screen.I shot around with a D40 that my sister-in-law owns the other day, and it was so frustrating to shoot with. It takes a long time to focus, it's very slow. It also has a delay to taking the picture, like a cheap point-and-shoot camera, vs. the D50 or 70 that shoot quite fast and perform well as far as focus goes. Also, another reason to avoid the D40 is that the auto-focus is in the lens rather than in the camera, so it makes the lenses really expensive (and quite crappy I might add). I don't think the D40 should even be in the \"D\" line, because it really isn't set up like a normal SLR. It is more like a fancy point-and-shoot. I hate it and I hope that you avoid paying more for less of a camera just because it is a newer model.

The big difference with the D60, I believe, is mostly just the self cleaning mode.  The difference in price is at least 100 dollars.As others have noted, ignore the excessive brand new price mentioned here.I use my D40x as my portable camera that I take with me when I don't want to risk damaging or losing my D90.  I've been considering buying something like a Canon G11, a large size point and shoot.  The G11 isn't really a pocket camera either.  While the G11 has lots of great auto features, it still can't match the manual controls of a DSLR and I'm fairly certain that the D40x can beat it in terms of noise and ISO usability.  I've taken night shots with the D40x at 800 ISO that came out great.I wouldn't recommend the D40x to anyone who's looking for the best entry level DSLR.  Given its age and functionality, I think it's pretty much limited to those on a really tight budget or those looking for an inexpensive back up.  When you compare the manual controls and the ISO capability compared to P&S; backups like the G11, it makes the D40x a good choice.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great little camera", "Author": "H.

At first I was looking to buy the D200, but after receiving the D40x as a gift I wouldn't have it any other way.  It's the smallest DSLR on the market which is perfect because I have little hands and it's makes for easy handling.  Also, the CCD image sensor is just amazing and makes everything so sharp with the help of the AF 3-area matrix metering system.  Quite honestly, I prefer the older 3D color matrix metering II on the D40x and D200 then the newer one on the D300 because the newer system tends to blow out highlights and data is lost where as the older white balance meter tends to show details in the highlights and darken the shadows.  Also, the LCD monitor is really big so you can view pictures easier which is awesome and the battery lasts a long time without having to charge all the time (if you don't use the built in flash alot like I do).

I sent that back to Nikon, and they said it had a bad coil, and the part was on backorder, so I was without my expensive flash for 3 months.

Many epileptics can not tolerate blinking displays, etc. ( I wonder if there is anyone in the world, epileptic or not, that likes these unnecessary, infinitely annoying blinking icons? )With this camera, the Nikon D40X, any time there is some sort of out-of-range exception or problem, the help icon starts blinking furiously. I was having seizures with the very first use of this camera and I still can't use it because of seizures. There is no way of disabling this, naturally. ( I guess you could tape over the area where the icon is? )Blinking anything is a relic from the dark ages of electronics where there was only a single LED or a seven segment LED to indicate status. With modern LCD panels there are infinite alternative implementations such as a reverse video over the help icon, changing the color to, say, red, placing a \"forbidden\" ( the circle with the diagonal slash ) over the setting in error.At least Nikon could either provide an option to disable this \"feature\" or to provide an alternate display as mentioned in the previous paragraph? Anyways, I am tired of having my brain scrambled so this will probably be returned. I did not spend a thousand dollars for a camera that I can not safely use.With the Nikon D200 and the Nikon D80, you can configure them so that they are  essentially epilepsy friendly. I have few problems with these two cameras and, if you are an epileptic, these are better cameras, too.BTW, the Canon Digital Rebel XTi ( which I, unfortunately, also have ), is also not suitable for epileptics as it has a similar problem to the Nikon D40X ( in it's case values blink and the EV display blinks if out-of-range ) The Canon is a more solid camera but it has fewer configuration options that the Nikon D40X.In the introductory paragraph I noted that essentially NO electronics company cares less about epileptics or the ADA. I have a whole box of advanced Texas Instruments calculators that I can't use. ( I requested accommodation a long time ago. No response, of course ) Considering that a couple of percent of the population has epilepsy, why won't these companies provide epilepsy friendly equipment?BTW, the one exception ( this is software ) is MatLab ( Math Works ).
