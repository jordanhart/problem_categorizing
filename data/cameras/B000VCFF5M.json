First, I spent some time with the Panasonic LX2 -- same camera as the Leica at less than half the price -- which has some unique features and seems to be a terrific camera.  BUT it won't go into a shirt pocket because the marvelous Leica lens protrudes.  At a hefty (!) 7.8 oz, it weighs 56% more than the Optio Z10's 5 oz.  The Optio is so small that there is nothing to hold onto.  The Panasonic is better in that respect, but significantly bulkier.I had just about decided to send both cameras back when I realized that I hadn't even looked at the few pix I had taken with the Optio.  So I duly transferred them to my Mac and was absolutely astonished by the results. For reasons I don't understand, the Optio seems to handle subtle shades in the sky and clouds better than the K10.The bottom line: The Optio produces razor-sharp pictures, even when using the 7x zoom hand-held at a slow shutter speed.  Given some of the negative comments in these pages, I really didn't expect that.  The design of the camera is superb.  I only wish there were some semblance of a grip to hold onto.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio Z-10", "Author": "Mike \"'ol Bell Labs/Weco Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1WTEMT7Z8Z1JR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera. You can use the Auto but I prefer to use the Green mode where you can set the settings as in my SRT 101 35MM camera. I took a outdoor shot of a veined flower, about 8 inches away. It came out extremely detailed, and trust me I'm pickey. I then used the stitch mode where you can create a 'Digital wide angle' it also worked great. The feature of the lens that uses a refraction mirror to go from wide angle to close is great as you never get the lens protruding from the camera. The features in this camera are plentiful and you can use them to get really fantastic pictures. Read up on this camera and compare for yourself, you'll love it.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera!!!", "Author": "Maxim V. Belkin", "ReviewID": "R3EVH3U3GKRE4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because of its huge optical zoom, 8 MP, new mirror optics and because it is Pentax. And this camera is absolutely great! The pictures are very juicy in color and clear! Nothing moves when you zoom - only mirrors inside the camera! It's true that the camera marks easily, but it can be easily cleaned! The Menu is very easy to read, with helping tips about each mode of shooting - a great plus for me since I don't like to read the manual. However there was one thing that frightened me and I did read the manual - if you press several times Ok-button - histogram will appear and if you want to shoot something that has spots which are very dark and very light - they will appear as yellow and red spots on the LCD display! In the beginning that made me think the LCD or camera itself is damaged. But - it's actually the way it's supposed to work!!! And now I think this is very useful tool! O! btw, to turn the camera on - you should move the plastic piece that covers lenses on front - tricky to understand but easy to do!So I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. That's why I give this camera 5 stars. A great camera in style!!!", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "If you like picture noise, buy the Pentax Optio Z10", "Author": "JRH \"j5094\"", "ReviewID": "R1VY5DF90R0TJ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera has speed settings from ISO 64 to 3200. Of these, only 64 and 100 are acceptable. In bright scenes you will get a picture with good detail and color and a small amount of noise.  Even at these low settings, a slightly magnified image will show noise as a speckling in the image. I made a mistake buying this camera - somehow misunderstanding its characteristics before I bought it. If you do not believe me, then read the professional reviews, such as at [...]The good - It's compact, has a 7x optical zoom, has a nice screen, easy to use controls, and takes adequate movies.The bad - It takes low quality noisy pictures, it has no image stabilization. Pentax claims it has image stabilization, but what they really do is increase the ISO level, reduce the exposure time, and greatly increase the noise level. You will get this effect whenever you take zoom pictures, except in the brightest of sunlight.My recommendation:  Do not buy this camera!  If you want a small high zoom camera that takes good movies, but has better noise characteristics, look at the very similar looking Casio with real image stabilization.  Pentax certainly could do better.", "Date": "December 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for anyone!", "Author": "M.

This camera is my quickie pocket camera and has proven itself worthy of the Pentax name.  The buttons are simple, intuitive and easy to read for any digital camera this size.  The zoom is awesome, but I usually don't go past the 7x optical because the digital zoom is like most digital zooms, grainy.  It isn't the fastest between shots, but it's usually fast enough even for sports, kids and pet action.  It shoots nice little videos with decent sounds quality too.  I have dropped this camera several times on hard surfaces, used it in rain and snow, and even dropped it in some water once and it still works great.  The LCD viewer is like all LCDs in the sun, a little hard to see, but I find that the photos always turn out better back home than they looked on the LCD.  Bottom line, for $200, this is a great, great camera.  I wouldn't have been upset paying $300 for it.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "My fourth Pentax", "Author": "Peter S.

She said that it was simply the best point and shoot camera on the market.  I bought the storyline and made the purchase without going to other stores, professionals, or reading online reviews.I thought the functionality of the camera was wonderful.  However, when I printed out the pictures all of the indoor ones looked extremely grainy.  The outdoor pictures were bright and clear but nothing from indoors. It was also difficult to get a picture that wasn't blurry.I took the camera back and bought a Sony W90.  I took similar photos (with similar objects, light etc.) and printed the pictures.  Sony was clearly the better camera.I would not recommend this camera.  The functionality is great but the quality of the pictures is poor.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Black Cat, White Dog, yummy", "Author": "mil aves", "ReviewID": "R2VXFXW9QR84HG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for over a year.  It is compact, (easy to carry in a purse or pocket), looks great, and has an interesting approach to auto settings; for example, it has a setting for \"food,\" and separate settings for dark-colored/light-colored dogs, as well as dark-colored/light-colored cats.  There are undoubtedly more auto settings than any single person would ever use.Still, if you want to have some fun, go and shoot some \"food.\"  I learned the easy/hard way that if you do this in a restaurant, the chef may come running out of the kitchen to find out (a) what is wrong with your dinner, or (b) what newspaper you work for.These are my problems with the camera:It has no viewfinder, but of course I knew that when I bought it.  Since it was my first digital point-and-shoot, I didn't realize how important that detail would be.  In bright light it is very hard to see the image on the screen.  On the beach during a trip to Hawaii, I was reduced to point-guess-shoot.The shutter button is not ergonomically designed, and it is very easy to jiggle the camera while trying to fit your finger down into the recess of the shutter release.  This surprised me; I have a small hand. My next camera will have a shutter button that sits slightly above the frame of the camera.In that vein, the toggle for the zoom function is hard to use without shifting your grip of the camera.As a result of the clunkiness, some of my still life photos are blurry, because I jiggled the camera while depressing the shutter release.  Other photos that should have been \"zoomed\" were not, because I would have had to move the camera away from my shot to do the zoom.Picture resolution is so-so.  From dazzling to pretty good if you do not want to enlarge the photo beyond its initial size, but not so good if you do your enlarging in PhotoShop or a similar program.  One person I've talked with says \"megapixels\" are the thing, and another say \"optics.\"  Supposedly, this camera has both.The shuttler lag time seems very long, but I have to say I am accustomed to using a DSLR with no evident shuttler lag at all.  I did some shooting with a CoolPix, just to compare, and indeed, the Pentax is slower.  I've missed a lot of shots.The camera has poor auto-focus under lower light conditions.My best shots using this camera have been outdoor scenery or tourist photos, low to normal daylight.  My worst shots are those where there is little contrast, those where the camera went into digital zoom, and those  I wanted to enlarge and/or to crop and isolate details.New, it cost me about $200 at a discount store.  As now priced (<$100) it is a nice buy and probably a good enough camera for almost anybody who wants high pixels with optics from a great company, many years in the camera business.", "Date": "March 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio Z10", "Author": "Don Darling", "ReviewID": "R1AAP156PV06QV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only problem I see with this camera is that in bright conditions outside you cannot see the screen or picture you are taking.

Of course there are cameras for taking superb pictures. Want to hoist around a tripod, perhaps a view camera, an umbrella, interchangeable lenses, lights? Hey, what happened to the landscape or the people or the big game?  Changed, or disappeared, or wouldn't behave, or stay still, or game over.  And driving in my car, wait, there's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get that special shot, maybe sell it to a newspaper.  So I carry it around in my shirt pocket, hit the \"green\" button which defaults to standard automatic mode, and click the shot. Did you get it too? Oh, you didn't have your camera handy at the time?  Or it was deep in your bag and anyway, the lens sticks out? This won't happen with the Optio Z10. And the picture quality far exceeds what you can get on a cell phone. And instead of a view-finder, I can show a picture to family and friends, and strangers, instantly on the big display screen. Then they can approve the likeness (or order you to delete it - that gains trust!).  And it records sound for 24 hours continuous if you want. And makes legal quality prints with dates. Check the manual (essential information), it does incredible things, but you need a bit of photo knowledge to read the settings. Practice automatic ability to make quick manual adjustments, and you can fix things to get rid of the problems others found. Now I won't go out without it, like those credit cards and house and car keys and cellphone. It's called \"portability\", the most important attribute for a point-and-shoot, in my book.4/20/2012 UPDATE: Oops. Now we have the IPhone4s, which I  just bought. The above review, while still valid, becomes somewhat irrelevant. The picture quality and screen size is every bit as good as the above point-and-shoot, maybe better.

The reason I picked this camera was because it had a 7x zoom without a retractable lense (there's lots of sand storms out here) so I wouldn't have to worry so much about dust.  Allow me to start of with the good notes. First and foremost, price! Just barely over 100 dollars is pretty cheap for a decent digital camera. Second, there are tons of features on this camera. Almost a con, because there are so many, sometimes I just want to take a picture and have it come out well. One really great feature is that you can turn the megapixels down from 8, all the way to 1.3.  This is great for e-mail quality, and unless you are going to print a poster, 3 megapixels is actually plenty. Third, the battery will last you all day long as well, which is very nice. Fourth, it works on a mac! And Finally, the video. The video is very good. Not quite 300 dollar camcorder good, but I have been able to capture good videos of explosions and the like.  Now for the cons. Yes, the camera does have a 7x optical zoom. However, the zoom is only slightly better then a digital zoom. I think this will probably be the only model pentax sells that will have the mirrored zoom. Second, is image quality. You might get lucky with the auto mode select, but chances are that you will not. If you have patience, then you can fiddle with the camera quite a bit to get your picture to come out well (that is, not grainy) The trouble is that you can't really tell how grainy the picture is by the LCD screen, so I would recommend taking several pictures with several separate settings, providing you have the patience, and time to do so.  There are other smaller pros and cons to the camera, but it will be a waste of time to list them all. The down and dirty is simply that it's a cheap camera, which will give you decent pictures, as long as you have the time to make all the proper adjustments. I wouldn't recommend taking this camera as your only point and shoot on a vacation spot that you will not visit again. However, if you just want something to take with you camping, a fun day at the park, or Christmas morning, the camera will get the job done.

The 7x zoom matches my old Olympus 320, and is very handy.  I do miss the viewfinder since using the screen outside is really hard.  You kind of have to look for bright parts in the scene and try to find them on the screen and then \"guess\" on composition since you really can't see any details, or much more than light and dark.  I'm going to look for some sort of after-market hood for the screen since that would help, I think.  I miss any sort of manual exposure or shutter speed control, but the camera seemed to pick pretty good exposures most of the time.  I'm going to try using the spot-metering to \"fine tune\" the exposures (since you can point at something to get the exposure you want and then lock it with a half button push).  The histogram is nice.  I got used to the sliding door lens cover, but it is pretty easy to bump open in your pocket, so be careful.  Since the lens is near one side, you have to be careful to keep your fingers out of the way, especially when shooting vertically (at least I had trouble with that).

I was able to get mine for $89.I've had it for less than a week, but have been snapping pictures every day with it. It's tiny and fits in a pocket, yet the buttons are very easy to handle. I've had no issue with noise in darker rooms, and even if I did, there are software programs to clear it right up.The menu options and picture taking modes are all simple and self explanatory. Anybody can pick up this camera and come out with crystal clear, vivid photos.Battery life isn't terrific, so grab an extra or two. Just a hint: you don't have to use the Pentax brand battery. You can find a 3.7V 700mAH for a fraction of the cost if you do a little searching. I found them for 21 cents each.
