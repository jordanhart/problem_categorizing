Everything about it is great, except for one thing.  When you run out of space on the memory card, if you are in the middle of filming, the file isn't closed so basically you lose everything you filmed.  The GoPro will end the video and make is usable.  If this camera did not have that one little flaw, I would be thrilled with it.  I lost videos of my kids at disneyworld because I recorded too long so it just created a corrupt file.

When I first tested it, the video was shifty and paused a bit every few seconds. I fixed this issue by formatting the memory card using the camera as the instruction manual suggested. One problem I was not able to fix, however, was the audio problems. I had intended to use this camera as a dash camera for when I go for drives with other car enthusiasts on the weekends. Unfortunately, each test recording I made had this horrible high-pitched squeaking noise that is impossible to ignore. Notably, this noise was present in all the recordings I made while testing each camera setting.I assumed that I may have a defective unit so I contacted Swann (who are based in Australia) via email. I sent them a carefully written email message that clearly describes the issue and further included a brief video clip that contained the background noise so they could hear the noise for themselves. Unfortunately, they never responded to my email message despite my having sent it multiple times to their customer service email address. I also attempted calling them, but the customer service line repeatedly led me to a dead end -- no human being and no way to leave a message.After this, I did a search online to see if I could find other people's videos that were captured with the Freestyle camera. I found one such video in which, like me, they had mounted the camera to the dash of a car. In that video you can hear the exact same noises that my unit captured. In view of this, it appears likely that the problem is not with my unit but with the design of Swann's camera/microphone. Perhaps this explains why Swann never responded to my emails and calls.In view of the above, I think the Freestyle camera is poorly designed. In addition, I think Swann's customer service is poor. I have now ordered the Go Pro Hero 2 Motorsports edition camera and I hope that my experiences with this camera and Go Pro will be better.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was great for the price", "Author": "Carl Tyler", "ReviewID": "R3D3DQ4T3Y27OI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already own a GoPro Hero and GoPro Hero2.  Plus I've spent a small fortune in the GoPro addons, attachments etc.  Then I saw this little Gem on one of those day sale websites.  They had it for $139,  that's about the same cost as the LCD bacpac + a spare battery for the GoPro.  So I wanted to see what this camera could do.Well out of the box, I was super impressed with what it came with.  LCD Panel, remote control, multiple mounts, waterproof case etc.Pros* I really like that the camera and the camera case have a regular 1/4 inch tripod mount.  This makes it so much easier to attach to standard mounts, like the UltraClamp.* Like that it has two different buttons for starting video and taking a photo.* Like the laser for lining shots up.* Like the LCD panel being standard, although it turns out I don't use it much.* Has a flat lens, so does not distort like the GoPro under water.Cons* The laser pointer is useless if you have it in the plastic case, it can't project out as the case blocks it.* The audio isn't particularly great, but then it isn't with the GoPro either.* The remote control doesn't have a very good range.Video quality is very comparable to the GoPro, especially when using the 720px60 mode.Conclusionat the price I paid, these things are almost disposable, I was impressed enough that I bought another and a couple as gifts when they were on sale again.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive POV Video", "Author": "ImageMD", "ReviewID": "R2IJE3K27ZYUFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

They combine the features of a camcorder with a surveillance camera. They are small, lightweight and equipped with a fixed focus wide angle lens. This unique category was pioneered by GoPro HD HERO2: Motorsports Edition (2011 Model) for photographing various sports from sky diving to surf boarding. The Swann Freestyle has several features which caused me to choose it over the GoPro but I will not do a side-by-side comparison. I have used my Swann for about 4 months and I will share with you some  observations which may assist your choice. The video was taken with the Swann Freestyle attached the handlebars of a bicycle. The video was edited using CyberLink PowerDirector 10 Ultra.Positives:1. Tripod Screw Mount: The tripod screw allows for mounting on any conventional tripod. The camera is so small that I routinely attach it to and hold it with 4 inch table tripod.2. Underwater Housing: An underwater housing is included. With the Go-Pro this is an extra. Also included are an assortment of mounting hardware and a nice pouch to hold the camera3. Laser Pointer: This is an advantage when the viewing screen is removed you want to point the camera.4. Remote Control: The remote control allows you to start and stop the camera from several feet away.5. LCD Viewing Screen: The screen makes for better composition, particularly useful with the wide angle field of view. Also, the screen permits playback viewing. The screen can be removed which should theoretically should extend the recording duration.6. 8meg Photos: The 8meg still photos give enough pixels to process and crop the images. The images are soft and require sharpening.7. Camera Controls: There are two switches and two buttons on the top surface of the camera. One switch turns the camera on and off. The other switch turns on sound activated video (which I have not tried). The red button turns on and off the video recording. The neutral button takes still photos.8. Durability: The camera is small and boxy but very durable. It fell off a 4 foot ledge while I was recording. The LCD display panel fell off but the camera continued to record.Negatives:1. Customer Service: I contacted customer service asking them whether the camera would take time-lapse photos while it was plugged in and charging, thereby extending the video duration beyond 2 hours. They finally replied after one month. The answer was no.2. Changing Settings: Most settings for the camcorder and camera reverts to the default settings when the camera is turned off. Changing settings requires stepping thru several menus on the tiny LCD screen.3. Spartan Manual: The 7 x 10cm manual is 39 pages of small print. The complexity of the camera requires several good instructional videos, an on-line manual or a CD.4. Vignette: The wide angle images have distortion and darkening at the corners.5. Low light conditions: The camera clearly works best in brightly lit scenes.This is an inexpensive way to get into POV video. It is a lot of fun and you will find many ways to use it. Do not buy it if you need a lot of hand holding from customer service and give yourself plenty of time to learn how to use the camera.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK, but lacking a few details, rating based on price/performance", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1D42SMGU19K28", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "[edited to correct the powered filming note] The camera works fine and is easy to use, but a few details bother me.

I'll put the camera on my bow as a shot cam, on my handlebars to see my crashes and near crashes, and on my sailboat to see the crew at work and play.One feature I miss, and will wait to get when it's availalbe and reasonably priced, is a waterproof camera that films direct to computer via wifi or usb. I'd like to run the camera non-stop to a computer on board my sailboat.

A friend of mine has one of these and his videos look great, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was especially excited about the prospect of a remote.Everything with this package works the way it should. Crisp and vivid 1080p video, several mounting options, and the aforementioned remote. It's easy to use, comes with an LCD screen AND a charger and has a great laser range finder option. Another positive is that there are lights all over it so you can tell if you're recording.

Not bad overall, but you can fix it if you edit with iMovie. I don't know what these other folks were talking about with the audio issuesRemote is awesome, but the range of it is only 6-8 feet, and even less if you have the camera in the housingOnly shoots at 30 fps - would like the option of 30, 60 and 120 fpsIf you want to see a video that I made with it [...]It's mounted to the front of my kayak, so all of those shots are with this camera.Overall, I like this camera so much, I bought a second one.

The worst thing I've seen with this camera is the low light grain getting pumped up a bit too far with auto gain... but it's not bad. I plan to use this camera to record high speed time-lapse, (or as Swann calls it \"continuous shooting\") and decent quality HD video on and around Mountain Biking! The \"continuous shooting\" mode has quite a few choices in time between shots, plenty in my opinion.I am now on the search for more mounting \"peel and stick\" plates as the kit comes with two normal flat, and one large curved helmet plate. The GoPro snap-lock \"peel and stick\" plates and the Swann plates are different and will not work with each other without some modification. Drag! However... the mounting arms/mechanisms from both GoPro and Swann can be swapped at the joints where they are tightened so if you have some GoPro connectors already you should be able to mix and match parts to come up with what you need. Yeah! The GoProH2 is a fantastic product, but the price point was too high for my tastes when this camera is going to take a beating on the trail. Tried a friend's GoPro this past winter backcountry skiing and was very disappointed with the handling of white,(snow) in direct sunlight was way over the 100% video limit and washed out all detail on multiple settings.I will post additional reviews after some tough trails with the Swann Freestyle. Time will tell.To address the repeated audio complaint, the cameras microphone is sealed inside a watertight enclosure, (same for GoPro) sound is not going to make it's way into the enclosure without some high Db sound, or something smacking the plastic housing.

It is very cool, functionally intuitive, and it comes with every accessory you should need except for extendable monopod and mini HDMI cable. I experienced the audio problem other reviewers have reported (prominent electronic background noise in recordings) using a 32Gb Transcend Class 4 card, but not with a 32Gb SanDisk Class 10. Your mileage may vary, but I did see where others asked for actual results, so that is my contribution. Using an Ultra High Speed card for full HD only makes sense now in retrospect. Maybe audio is where slower cards break down? I see where another reviewer demonstrated the fisheye warping in the corners and he was (imho overly) disappointed with this lens, but I will defend it as a tradeoff between the generous wide angle and the fast 2.8 brightness of the glass. I shut off the lights and shot with only my aquarium for illumination and was very impressed with the light gathering abilities of this little guy.

So far the camera held up to my riding, the video quality (I use 720p @ 60 fps to save some space and have ability for slow motion) in clear sunny days is great but heavily wooded areas with spotty lighting can have some blurring.The sound is the weakest point of this camera - when in in waterproof case there is very little sound that gets through, at higher speeds there is definitely wind noise which I kind of like but it seems that other cameras have clearer sound and capture more of it. There is also some 'digital' noise in background - seems to be pretty typical for this camera. It is worth mentioning that my first camera had to be returned after all sound has completely gone away; also when attached inside of the car there is a lot of rattling noise that was happening (in this case it was not in waterproof case) - I got replacement quickly and without a problem.Also, although maybe only relative to mtb application, sometimes it is hard to hear the beep for recording when camera is mounted on my helmet and I end up guessing whether it's recording.I'd actually give the camera 3.5 stars due to sound issues and some little things like remote and laser pointer not quite working with waterproof case.

I exchanged my first one over the sound issue thinking it was just the one I had been sold.  It wasn't. They all have terrible sound. But the video is fantastic, the screen is nice, the remote is awesome. Also, and you can research it just like I did, it has the same 5mp sensor as the first hd gopro does. One other thing, its not as rugged as the gopro. Its tough but outside of the water proof case, if it fell down a flight of stairs it would probably go to peices. But honestly for the price, sound wasn't that big of an issue as i'm recording seperate audio for my personal projects.  But if sound is important to you may want to consider another hd mini cam. I give it 2 stars because I shouldn't have to find out a product is lacking a major feature through trial an error.

Initial impressions:  While the camera came with a good variety of mounts,  none of them was suitable for my purpose.  So I ran down to the hardware store and $5 and an hour later I had rigged a mount for my bike.  Now to the camera.  I was surprised by the quality of the picture.  Resolution and color were good, and it adjusted itself for changing light.  So far, I've only tested it in daylight.  But the video was so jumpy, I got dizzy later while watching it on the computer.  Maybe I should have put more effort into that mount.  Also, it was hard to cinch up the adjustment arms that came with the included mount so that the camera wouldn't slip down.  So a good part of this video was the ground under my bike.  I kept having to adjust the camera and wrench on the clamp a little more.  To it's credit, it didn't break and eventually I got it to lock down tight.  The camera ran for 30 minutes and then saved that file and seamlessly started a new one.  It did this twice, but on the third file the camera stopped after 27 minutes, so the last 40 minutes of my ride weren't recorded.  That's OK--by that time I was pretty wasted anyway and it would have made a really boring video.  The camera spent the previous night on the charger, so I know it had a full charge.  Since that first ride, I've attempted to use the camera on a few other occasions, mostly without success.  It didn't go on my ride today because it refused to record.  I later found out that the memory chip had backed out of the slot.  This has happened several times, so at least next time it happens I'll know what to look for.  But this is kind of annoying, especially when you don't discover it until you try to view the video later and it's not there.  Once, I accidentally installed the camera upside-down in the waterproof case.  Don't ask me how, I'm like that.  Actually it's pretty easy, but don't do it--it's a real pain to get it out.  If you install the camera correctly, it goes in--and out--easily and the case appears solid and waterproof--but to be honest, I didn't really test this feature.  The picture on the detachable LCD screen is bright and very clear.  The menu is easy to navigate though somewhat limited.So, my first impression is that this is a good camera with good picture and build quality, with some annoying exceptions.

I'd gladly pay for a case that could hold the LCD so I knew what I was taking a picture of.2) You have to get a lot closer to the subject than you think.

I intended to use this as a car cam, for two reasons.  I go driving with a bunch of car club guys and would like a record of some of these country cruises, and second I've been in some almost accidents recently.  The driving skills and etiquette of people in the Northern Virginia area have deteriorated. No one understands that driving to and from work or on an excursion with the family is a social activity, with give and take. Not a Mad Max post-apocalyptic winner take all gladiator sport.This camera is not adequate for the second purpose, to record in detail the cars around me. I'm giving it three stars. It's great for the price, but all that means is you get what you pay for.  It does not have the claimed professional HD quality, video is blurry. Details like the words on street signs and directions are not distinct. You can't see the license plate numbers of cars ahead of you unless these are ten feet directly in front but still not clear. The quality of the lens and the sensor are obviously below that of comparable high def cameras like the Go Pro or the Sony Action Cam.  There is one other designed/made in China video cam specifically sold as a car cam, with the same sensor as the GoPro but more expensive than this Swann. I have seen the result and the quality is much better.  I am disappointed as supposedly Swann is in the surveillance and security camera business. Then they should have the research and design capability plus the capital to back better products. In comparison, the much smaller Chinese companies seem to be coming out with competitive products every month.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Camposeco Montenegro Alfredo", "ReviewID": "R317J6M1SYTBN8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ITs a good item, the camera is very great!!!! and perfect for any sport.

It looks like a camera that Derick Zoolander would use... The Bad- The camera warps the outer edges of the video pretty bad. You can see it in some of the videos on youtube. I could live with that just because this camera has a waterproof case for shooting videos underwater. What I cant live with is the constant squeaking sound that overpowers each video. I don't know what it is but inferring from other reviews it seems to affect all units. I'm not going to fight a company with poor customer service over this product. It's going back.Edit- I dont know why but my unit is not producing the squeaking sound in the attached video. The camera must be susceptible to electronic interference which would explain why I got the squeaking in the car. Anyway check out the distortion in the uploaded video.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOISE Stress", "Author": "gemstones", "ReviewID": "R1GUIXC6UN3RRC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Exactly Noise problem as well no customer support like Mr \"Rex Racer\"'s  Annoying background noises.I request many times upgrade firmware to fix the blacknoise,PLease, buy if you want to hear great black noise and no support and no reply web based Customer supportI think Customer support sleep all the time because of time difference.

Tanca", "ReviewID": "R2R6LPSBKZKGDX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here's my review...If you're even remotely interested in buying this \"camera\" you'll read this review and learn from my mistake.I actually ended up getting 2 of these as I thought the first one i bought was a dud. Not the case. They are all horrible. I don't even know where to begin.There is no software or customer support for this camera. I tried calling Swann customer service and was astounded how incompetent their reps were. All I wanted to know was how much a spare battery would cost in the event that I wanted an extra battery. The rep kept trying to explain to me that I don't need an extra battery instead I should charge my existing one. After 3 attempts trying to explain to him that I knew how to charge my existing battery, and that I just wanted to buy a spare, I finally got pissed off and hung up on him once he tried telling me it was impossible to remove the battery from the camera (which of course isn't true as I was holding the battery in my hand while on the phone with him).The quality, not even remotely close to HD. That's probably why YouTube only has a handful of videos recorded from a Swann Freestyle. Its so grainy it's ridiculous. The \"1080 HD\" looks like it was recorded on a shoulder mount vhs recorder from 1989.  Probably one of the crappiest features is trying to export video to a Windows computer. The video will transfer over, however if you try to play the video back on the computer it skips, freezes, and lags so much it looks like a series of still photos patched together in a sideshow. The owners manual states that if this happens (and it will), the workaround should be to watch your video on the detachable 1 inch screen or connect your camera to your tv and watch it there. Seriously!?!!! That's the workaround!?! That pretty much means that video editing is pointless even If you can find compatible software to edit your footage.The sound quality is so bad it might as well not even have a mike. It scratches and clicks and makes a high pitch squealing noise.The only two good things about this camera is the remote control and the waterproof housing (which appears to be constructed well).In conclusion, STAY AWAY from this camera. I returned both of these.I marched my butt over to REI and gladly shelling out an extra $100 for the GoPro Hero 2. The quality of the camera and video/photos it produces is unparalleled. You really do get what you pay for. In the case of the Swann Freestyle what you get is a $175 decroded piece of crap.The freakin-end.**update** to answer some of the comments to my review, I am using a top of the line laptop to upload my videos so it's not my computer. I even tried it on my desktop and got the same result. I was also using a class 10 Sandisk card. If this camera works for you more power to you. I went through 2 of them and they were garbage to me. I recently bought a GoPro Hero 3 as well and this thing doesn't remotely compare to the Hero 3 in construction quality and video quality.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nicely done", "Author": "Michael P.
