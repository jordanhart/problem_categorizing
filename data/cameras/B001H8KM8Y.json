The color is great and the resolution is excellent.I would not hesitate to buy this camera again and recommend it to friends.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leica C-Lux 3 review", "Author": "Arnold H. Lee \"tech collector\"", "ReviewID": "R3DKMQHLM9Y129", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sustains:- I own a C-Lux 1, received it as a gift in 2006.  This camera is just a bit thinner, but looks even more so due to the design.- The controls have been simplified greatly.  The wheel which controls the type of shot you take has been reduced from 6 (?) settings to two.  The on/off switch received a cosmetic change, but retained the hard \"click\" which makes it difficult to turn on accidentally in your pocket.- I purchased the glossy white camera.  In contrast to my regular silver, this glossy white looks very nice.Improves:- More ISO settings.  The ISO setting as essentially unchanged through the C-Lux 1 to the 3.- A screen protector should come as a default with this camera.  You will need to buy one.- I didn't receive a memory card with my camera.  For 600 dollars, you expect to receive even a 512 MB memory card.  If I hadn't had a spare, this gift would have been unusable out of the box.  Ridiculous.Bottom Line:  This is a Leica.  You can purchase the same optics and CCD through the Panasonic Lumix line, but you are purchasing this because you like the red dot.  It's ridiculously expensive for the technical specs, and is an adequate point and shoot camera, but sometimes, only a leica will do.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "excellent go anywhere fit anywhere camera", "Author": "Leo Gorelik \"LeoG\"", "ReviewID": "R2GJJJL7ZGD2Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the best camera i have used.  it takesexcellent pictures without having any need to make adjustments", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Leica C-Lux 3 Digital Camera (White)", "Author": "R.

So portable, I carry it in my purse for any time picture taking.  I'm always getting compliments on the awesome picture quality.  It has many features and yet so easy to use.  I'm generally a point and shoot photographer and have had several cameras that claim to be a point a shoot.

Savaresse \"yochiga\"", "ReviewID": "R1UUILD4WU3EPD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i just got my leica like most people I can't take my DSLR everywhere I go, I needed a point and shoot. I wnt off to the camera shop to look at the panasonic lumix several models sounded excellent. First off the Lumix LX3 is amazing it has a great feel but all the other panasonic felt like they would fall apart at any moment, plastic bodies, plastic switches. And then I checked out the Leica C lux 3 and wow what a difference (the lumix LX3 should be compared to the D Lux it has all the bells and whistle)a slim metal body with super sharp images.

It's not just the red dot you're paying extra for, IMO.It's an excellent point&shoot; camera with a wide-angle zoom lens (although I don't like the extreme tele-end on P&S; in general). What it's lacking is manual controls, but you have D-LUX 4 for that. I ended up selling mine to get a point and shoot with manual controls (GRD from Ricoh) but would have kept it if I wasn't tight on budget. Will surely miss this little piece with the red dot.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Leica quality\nSharp Leica Lens\nEasy operation\nExtremely compact size\nLarge brilliant veiwing screen", "Name": "Leica C-Lux 3 Digital Camera (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P9Vd94C-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001H8KM8Y"}}
