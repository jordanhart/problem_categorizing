Wateproof to 10 ft, smile shutter, transformation mode - so many features to chose from! The included memory card was initially defective. After speaking with the manufacturer, they sent me a brand new card to use within two days. Thats fixed all my problems. Has a nice weight and feel to it. The rubber buttons add a real nice touch. All in all, a fantastic camera and would recommend to all. Got a good deal with free shipping from Amazon so can't go wrong there", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Construction Site Camera", "Author": "HollyM", "ReviewID": "R2RS4DL29ARDS0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera that would survive on a construction site and still take good quality photos for our build blog and sponsor/volunteer database. So far this has been the perfect choice! It's not only waterproof but also has a tough exterior so I have confidence that it will make it back to me each time I send it out. I was concerned with the quality of the photos at first, when I viewed them in the viewfinder, but was pleasantly surprised to see them after uploading to my computer.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Junk.", "Author": "chickie", "ReviewID": "RN0C1R1NGZ8WW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 2 of these for Christmas for each of my kids. We were going to Mexico, and I thought the underwater feature would be fun for them.Within one week, both of the cameras leaked and are completely broken. At no point were they in deeper than 2 feet of water, even though they are supposedly waterproof to 10 feet. We took great care to make sure the battery compartment was closed completely and correctly each time, but it still leaked. The first camera completely broke immediately. The second one first lost the lcd screen, but within a day was completely inoperable. They were never dropped or mishandled.If I could give no stars, I would.Even when working, the pictures are not great and inconsistent. They are constantly blurry and we would have to take several of the same shot to try and to get one decent one.I have tried to get the company to do something with the warranty, but they have not responded to phone calls.Cameta Camera (the seller) did not offer a longer return period for Christmas gifts, so now I am stuck with them - and my kids have nothing.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera!", "Author": "Mike T.", "ReviewID": "RXGCOTIO2ON3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really nice camera with a whole lot of features.

They called me and told me that the camera is back ordered in black.  After discussing some different options and determining that their availabe options is not suitable for me, I told them to cancel my order and that I would buy a camera elsewhere.  I bought the camera elsewhere and lo and behold, I got an email two days ago from the vendor stating that the camera was shipped.  I had told them to cancel my order and had already purchased another camera elsewhere.  The camera showed up on June 18th anyway and was just dropped off at my door without a signature request.  I decided to try it and give it a shot since it was already here and keep it for myself may be (original need for the camera was for my son which I ended up buying from Costco).  The camera is very cheap and light weight and the pictures that it takes are completely fragmented, completely useless.  I dont believe this is the real Bell&Howell; brand.  It feels very much like a chinese knock off, a $10 camera they are trying to push as the original.  I would not recommend this camera at all and defintely not the vendor who shipped it, called, Video Camera Center, Inc.  I am surprised that Amazon has gone to such low place to be using this vendor.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "does not work underwater", "Author": "vitace", "ReviewID": "R31L3AFVQUI9Q0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my Thanksgiving trip to the Caribbean. After immersing it into the water at home I was able to take some good quality pics. However, some days later it stopped working (not able to switch it on) and it looked like water got into the camera. No troubles with the return though. Then I purchased Canon Powershot D10 12.1MP camera for my trip...the same disaster again. Good pics on the soil but no functioning underwater - I was not able to take even one underwater pic with it. The camera was full of water. I am probably just unlucky but next time I will rely on disposable Kodak cameras again.", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor Response time on requests", "Author": "Stephen Weinberg", "ReviewID": "R3GNOPPD3JH3RS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Camera that hasn't shipped yet, due to the timely manner that I needed the camera i have sent 3 e-mails to this company in two days to change the shipping, no response.
