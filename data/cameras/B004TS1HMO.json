Youtube videos help.No Audio for remote access.I bought it to check on my kids when they are home alone after school. I love the remote access and the ability to pan around the room. It took me about 3 hours to setup. User manual helps but there are videos on you tube to set up locally on network and remotely that helped alot. Now that it is up and working I love it. The only thing that would make it better is audio.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as good as expected", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R2RI3GGBWPPL00", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cons: One camera shipped with a missing part to mount it with. One camera stops panning after 1st round. The other's infrared lights don't show but it still works - go figure... Both have a seriously flawed software add on, which shuts down or requires you to download a browser control each and every time. Works better with Google Chrome than IE9 but has less control with Chrome. It always forgets the setup and usually I find it pointed at the ceiling and shut down when I return each week. One time one of the cameras went brain dead and would not power up until I reset it, got serious with the power source - not sure why it would not power up but after several tries it woke up. Never tried my cell phone. Has a seperate software add on for each type of browser (Push or Pull - not sure whats the difference but 2 types still require a load each time). Maybe its Windows Seven....or the ocx code is junk or the browser cannot trust it.Plus: Price. Pan, Auto night vision and can be used locally via wireless LAN. DOES NOT REQUIRE A YEARLY SERVICE!Setup is slow but with a direct connection to my laptop and a couple resets I got it to stick to my own setup.I removed the default DDNS setup (China watching?) and left it as locally named for the areas they are in. I still will use them as I am growing tired of trying to find better motion wireless cameras this inexpensive. I just remote into a server on the premises each time I want to view. If I enabled my own DDNS it probably would still have the same software problems anyway. Since it stops for no reason and aims at the sky its always a 5 minute setup for 5 minutes of viewing - so having the local computer to knock it up side the head is ok. Just cannot depend on it still working when I leave. Always forgets the daylight setting and brightness/contrast numbers and the saved locations never work.I will try a more expensive Wireless Night vision (but fixed position) system like Lorex next.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works as described", "Author": "J.

The user manual reads as if written by a Chinese who entered the US illegally through Mexico.  Dependence on the user manual will result in a camera that ends up in the trash can.  There are two videos available, one on zmodo's web site and found under the Knowledge base articles and another on Utube that can get you through the installation.  Once installed you will find the user manual does little to help in your use of the camera.I have found that although I finally got things to work on a Windows 7 Professional 64 bit system, when I tried to monitor the same camera from a Windows 7 Professional 32 bit system the camera view overlapped the controls which resulted in no control of the cameras from the secondary system.The problems I have noted with the camera and its operation are many, a few are as follows:1.  The motion Detectors are not reliable and overly sensitive to slight changes in lighting conditions.2.  The setup for \"Mail Service\" is confusing.  I could not get it to pass any tests including the built in test.3. The time, once synced to your PC time, will not stay synced with PC time.  It will drift off a few minutes each day.  So if you depend on semi-accurate time stamps, you should re-sync the time at least once per day.4.  You must open the Internet Explorer window as an administrator unless you DO NOT plan to save your recordings to disk. (This fact is actually mentioned in one of the videos, but is not emphasized.)In general the user manual does not explain any of the options you have available from the setup menus.  Unless you like to experiment, do not bother with the product.While there may be ways around the problems I have seen I would not recommend this camera for the average user.  You will suffer quite a few headaches.", "Date": "May 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Wireless IP pan/tilt Security Camera", "Author": "sshjaguar", "ReviewID": "R1SZT697XGI92T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't speak highly enough about this device... so nice I bought it twice!
