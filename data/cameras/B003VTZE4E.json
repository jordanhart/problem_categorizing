Akridge", "ReviewID": "R2QP6EST5TWM0F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent sometime with it and now here are my thoughts. Well I must say I really like the look of it. The build feels great except the buttons. Nothing is wrong with the buttons but because its so small its something to get use to basically.*edit. A word about its quality. I just dropped it from eye height onto a hard surface. It still works/looks like new. Very impressed.Next point. Its very thin and small. The zoom however is not compromised by this and is just great while taking pictures at full zoom are very clear/sharp.The video feature is great. You can use zoom while recording, and there are different quality settings to save space.The nav is simple enough and it doesn't have too many features. I know cameras for the same price often have almost too many options but this has a nice balance. That is both a plus and a minus. If your a control freak then this is not for you. If you love the simple life then this is a good pick. Its just super easy to use and take good pictures. While its not loaded with features/manual controls it does come with plenty of preset options.  This will do for anybody really.Summary:The pictures come out great, zoom is great, style is great and the video is good for the price (I paid $150.) Panorama stitch mode is very nice as well. The camera isn't the best in the world but fair for the price.*Edit: Tried the easyshare software using my Mac. Its very easy to setup, just plug into computer and turn on the camera. Once the install is done you can setup all you have to do is put in your account info for the sites you want to have options to auto upload later on. The share button is easy enough. The software will also ask when you plug in your camera if you want to copy your photos and after if you want to wipe the camera card. Very simple and easy. Has nice options of uploading size to reduce time, send to e-mail accounts, and comment to on pics before publishing to sites like facebook.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Huh?

I'm a dedicated Kodak camera user and recently bought this one as an upgrade to an old one that experienced water damage. The camera itself is well made, thin and easy to use as expected. Shutter speed is excellent as always. However compared to other kodak cameras bought in the past the picture quality is just not that great. Close up shots tend to come out great. However any photo in which I had to zoom is definitely not what I expected. Also the display screen images are very grainy compared to display screens on previous Kodak cameras I owned. Honestly for 130 dollars you can't really complain too much. However  as a dedicated Kodak camera user I prefer and expect better picture quality. Now I'm tempted to purchase the Canon 1400is which my sister recently purchased and picture quality is excellent.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "I want to run over this camera with my truck!", "Author": "JSRobertson", "ReviewID": "REU8T31DU3705", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned a lot of cameras and have never had one that I could say I absolutely hated until the M590.  From the day I got it out of the box, I have had nothing but problems.  It often will not take a picture.  Then 5 or 10 seconds later, it takes one.  I have many pictures of my carpet and ceiling.  It freezes up and says \"processing\" and the only way to get it to stop is to take the battery out.  It won't turn off about every 3rd time I use it and the only way to turn it off is to take the battery out.  The zoom often won't work, and then suddenly 20-30 seconds later it will zoom on it's own.  Maybe I received a dud, but I see that at least 1 other user has had similar issues.Only pros: it's cheap, cute, and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.

I kept it and returned the Nikon in 2 days.I am a very experienced photographer with a GREAT DSLR (Pentax KX) and have had many digital cameras...PRO: FAST shoot time from power on, plus quick turnaround between shots.  GREAT image quality in many varied settings using basic camera setting.  Really good video a plus.  USES THE SAME POWER CORD AS ALL OF MY OTHER DEVICES!!!!!!!  A HUGE plus - I can use my existing car and home chargers for my phone and it seems to do fine.  All menu buttons are REAL buttons and don't require a warm - dry - un-gloved hand to navigate a touch screen(like the Nikon) - this is going to be important in the winter.  Easy to stick in a pocket since it is so small!  Built tough best I can tell.  Green light for distance is cool.  Can shoot a great shot in pitch dark using the range finder and flash (don't know why anyone would ever need that, but was a cool test).  No lens sticking out the front - very pocket friendly.CON: Like several reviews said - the power button is dreadfully sensitive!!!!  Picking up the camera and putting it in a pocket will turn it on.  Good news is the battery has been pretty tolerant.  I would love to see a firmware update that addresses this by simply adding a one second press to turn the camera on and off.  That would eliminate the accidental power cycles.  Another con is that it uses MICRO SD, not a huge deal, but I can;t re-use the already massive supply of SD cards I already own nor can I just plug the memory card into my laptop - but again, not a huge deal.  Face tracking is not the fastest, but pretty good for a hundred dollar camera (on sale).This is a good choice and a pleasure to own so far.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love my Kodak M590.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RYO6IFTNW02UP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am very glad I decided to buy the Kodak M590. It is, overall, a pretty amazing camera. It's super slim and sleek and very adorable. It takes very clear, crisp, beautiful pictures even without flash or if you have to zoom in a lot. It takes pretty good video for a point and shoot camera and it even let's you take still pictures from a video. There aren't a lot of confusing buttons, there's only a few and they're very basic and self explanatory.I also like how you can scroll through your pictures and pick which ones you want to share on all the networking sites like Facebook, Flickr, etc.. The easy share button is definitely a plus. As soon as you plug it in to your computer, your pictures are sent to where you want them to go.My one and ONLY complaint is that when you take pictures without flash, you have to hold your hands very still! If you move even a little, it will come out blurred. It took me a few tries to get a good picture of my lit-up Christmas tree with the lights off and my flash off to get a good picture. As long as you can sit tight for the one second it takes for the picture to show, you'll be fine.I would definitely recommend this camera to a friend!

I have been traveling a lot more & would either be using my mom's bulking older camera or my iPhone 3Gs.  The older camera was inconvenient to bring along with me & had too many attachments to keep track of.  The iPhone camera is super convenient, but not very good quality.  So, I knew I needed to make an investment on a new camera.  I looked around & decided on this one.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.  The camera is small & the color & look of the camera is appealing.  It took me some time to learn how to switch through all the modes & to zoom, but once these were learned, I could switch through them easily & quickly.  The picture quality is great & the facial recognition software is nice.  The software used to upload the photos onto your PC is auto installed & easy to use too.  The only thing that was really disappointing for me with this camera is the Facebook share feature.  I had thought that you could select it on the camera & it would automatically upload onto FB.  However, it doesn't do this until you actually connect the camera to your PC.  At that point, I'd want to view the pictures & possibly modify the pictures a bit before uploading.  So, the auto share feature seems pointless to me which is disappointing b/c that was something I was really excited about when I ordered it.  I would still recommend the camera - it does take great pics - just be aware of how the FB share tool works.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value!", "Author": "Carrie Hanson", "ReviewID": "R1AFJPFJTQF8W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for about a month now and I think it's an awesome camera for the price. As far as 'point and shoot' cameras go, this is the best I've owned (I've had Casios and Nikons before). All the pictures I've taken have come out incredibly clear, even those that were taken in low light or using the max zoon. Using the camera is easy to figure out and pretty self explanitory- I've only had to get out the instruction booklet a few times. I also haven't had the problem with the power button that others do, where it turns on very easily.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase!

The issue is the qulity of still pictures. Sometimes it is sharp *(never as sharp as my casio exilim though) and sometimes it is pretty poor sharpness. I am not sure why. Close ups seem to be sharper but distances of around 10 feet are really hit or miss.

Eichler Jr. \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R3CPSE06T7CIP2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Unlike other reviewers who gave this camera a bad review, I don't really have a problem with the picture quality.  You do have to stand fairly still while taking pictures, especially if the flash is off, to avoid getting grainy/blurry pictures, but that's been the case with every digital camera I've owned.However, my family and I just got back from a vacation, and as I offloaded the pictures from the camera and looked at them, I found that in a good portion of them, either my finger was blocking half the shot or it was a picture of the inside of my pocket.  That's my problem with this camera - it's really poorly designed.  The lens is in the upper left corner (as you hold it to shoot) and the button to take a picture is at the top right.  So the natural way to hold it leaves your fingers right over the camera lens unless you're really, really careful about it.  And the buttons must be awfully touchy because I ended up with the camera going off at least a half dozen times while it was in my pocket.There are five buttons in the back - flash on/off, delete, menu, info and view picture.  They're right up against each other, and if you're in a dark environment (like an indoor ride at an amusement park), it's REALLY easy to accidentally press the delete button when you meant to turn the flash off or bring the menu up.The kicker is that when we got home, I discovered that the first 60 or so pictures that we took were just gone.  No idea what happened to them - they're just not on the camera any more.  I know they were there just a couple days ago, because I got bored waiting to get on a ride and looked through them all.  I don't know if I accidentally pressed a button or what, but the whole first day and a half of our vacation was just magically deleted off the camera.I guess once I get used to how the thing functions and learn to avoid the pitfalls it'll be an OK camera, but right now I'm pretty disgusted with it.POSTSCRIPT - a couple months ago my daughter was using this camera to take some pictures and set it down on her bed.  It slid off and fell about two feet onto the knobby end of an extension cord on the floor.  That was enough to destroy the camera.  The outer casing was dented really badly, and the camera wouldn't power up any more.  So on top of all its other flaws, this camera is really flimsily built.  Frankly I was glad it got destroyed because it gave me the excuse to go buy a much better camera.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "All that glitters is not gold", "Author": "Mr. N", "ReviewID": "R1MV16GYDRBMRD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I should have looked at other reviews before I bought this!...I thought hey; purple camera, getting it for my intelligent sister, its feminine and looks simple as well as sleek...jackpot!....maybe?....boy was I wrong; you know how when you send a gift and someone likes it, they call immediately and thank you, if not they still call you immediately and...'tell you'...to put it nicely.

If i hadn't had a Canon PowerShot nearby, and just for fun took a family photo with both, and then compared, I would not have realized it is just second-best. I really missed having a Kodak (my previous one went swimming and didn't survive), and the Canon interface was new and different, so I spent a hundred dollars on a new Kodak. But side by side, it was obvious. I guess it's the lens sharpness that just doesn't match the Canon. I am returning this Kodak after one-day's use.

I have owned two of them. I gave the first one away as a gift after having it for about 7 months, and immediately bought another one for myself again. I paid less for the 2nd one, which I bought here at Amazon. The first one I bought at Office Depot for $80.00, which was still a great price, and Amazon's price was even better.I only find two minor faults with the camera. The first one is that the button for turning the camera on and off and the one for snapping photos are the same size and are side by side, which sometimes causes one to shut the camera off when you meant to snap a photo, or you snap a photo when you meant to shut it off.The second problem is that the instruction manual is practically useless. It's so vague on some things and does not even mention others. When I had my first camera I ran into a problem where it would shut off when I connected it to the computer via USB cord to download photos. It would just shut off completely. No where in the instruction manual could I find any reason why. Finally, by trial & error I discovered that the microSD card had to be formatted by the camera. The option for this is found under \"configurations\". THIS IS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE INTRUCTION MANUAL! Once I formatted the camera never gave me trouble, and  I recently bought another card, a 32GB microSD card for it. I went into \"configurations\", formatted it, and all's well.Aside from that, the camera is great, and it takes video of a quality that's equal to a camcorder. I've never had a digital cam that takes quality video until this camera. Every other digital camera I've had in the past took great photos, but the video was of inferior quality.

Sadly, someone else liked my camera too and stole it from me. I searched high and low for a replacement and couldn't find one. I am so glad I turned to Amazon. I found a replacement for a great price. I am anxiously awaiting its arrival!

I have previously owned 3 Kodak cameras (CX7250; M833; M1033). I currently own the Z950. (Best ever). Upon deciding to purchase the M590 for my daughter I was impressed with the advertisement of the camera being the \"world's thinnest\" camera and the fact that the user would be able to upload pictures to YOUTUBE, Facebook, etc. with the push a button after connecting to the computer. Anyway, upon receiving the camera I loved the design of the camera. After owning so many Kodak cameras I am very familiar with the \"bells and whistles\" and also I think the Kodak cameras are very user-friendly. First, I think the camera was defective because the camera would not charge up after plugging the USB cord in the adapter. I was unable to take pictures if it was not plugged up. The pictures came out ok but the display on the 2.7 LCD screen were grainy and not clear. The body of the camera had too much plastic making it have a \"cheap\" feel to it because of the lightweight thin body. I repeatedly tried to charge the battery but it just would not work...so I returned the camera for a refund with no problems from Amazon. Also, after I had purchased the camera, Amazon had the camera for a lower price than my purchase price. I bought another Kodak camera...M580 which is excellent. (didn't purchase from Amazon but Amazon has that camera also).

It seemed to happen more often when I switched between camera and video mode.  My daughter noticed the same thing when I gave it to her.  It would happen about every 30 minutes of shooting, just enough to be a pain in the neck and make you miss good shots.  One of Kodak's other Easyshare cameras had a similar problem.  Kodak said they hadn't heard of that problem on this unit.  I guess they have heard about it now, as I'm reporting it.

You can \"tag\" your photos for upload to FB, e-mail, YouTube, etc. on the camera...then when you connect your camera to the computer, it quickly and easily distributes these photos to whatever site you've previously indicated.  Not so bad, but definitely not as convenient as I was hoping.  Reviews of this product were misleading and now I wish I had purchased a different camera.Additionally, the power cord is a little finicky - have to really wiggle it in the microUSB port to get the camera charging, and I didn't figure this out for several days.  The good news is that most cell phone chargers with a microUSB cord will also do the trick, making it convenient for traveling and consolidating.I will say that it takes good pictures and the features are very easy to use.
