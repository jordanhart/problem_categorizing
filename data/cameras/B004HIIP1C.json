To adapt these cameras the internal IR filter is usually removed (easily done-many instructions on the web) and a C-mount adapter and 1.25\" IR or IR/UV filter make this telescope ready. The camera output is standard analog video (PAL on some versions) that you can connect to a display with a standard RCA type video cable (the yellow plug). You will need a BNC adapter to connect an RCA cable to the camera or you can buy a BNC/RCA video cable for very little money. To capture the image on a PC you may also need a USB frame grabber, a dongle that converts the analog signal from the camera to a digital format for the PC.There are superior cameras at much higher price points, at several hundred dollars less; this one is a good initial buy. It serves very well for imaging the planets and brighter deep space objects such as Orion and the Ring Nebula. The maximum exposure time of 8 seconds limits the camera to brighter objects, but in practical terms, it extends your seeing range by 2 orders of magnitude or more.The camera is very good for solar viewing with a white light filter and many think that on Jupiter and Saturn it beats the longer exposure cameras such as Malincam. When you move up to use something better this camera can still for guiding and planetary work.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, solid day/night color camera", "Author": "Thomas Simmons \"Big Ugly Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R28YHWWFBX3DY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Has sense up, control for a DC lens, easy to use menu system (push buttons on back of camera) and runs on either 12 or 24 volt.I'm into Astronomy, so this camera also is used as a Meteor Cam.
