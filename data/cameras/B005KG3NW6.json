Just \"okay\"I must say, I'd love to see Kodak be the number one USA digital camera maker, they have been in the photo industry so very long and have been a respected camera company for decades.Sticker on the bottom says this one is made in Indonesia.I'll have to judge photo quality against our Canon Powershot A630 & A640 in the same price range, I use more expensive Canon cameras but unfair to compare to this price range.Kodak must have designed the Z5010 to hit a price point I guess, since it's the latest 2011 release but is far less in the specifictions and features than their slightly more expensive (MSRP) Z990 MAX that came out earlier this year.After a hundred test shots in various situations and lighting I find it will take decent photos when there is lots of nice bright sun, and will take some okay photos with the built in flash, but makes way too much noise if you use it for low light photography.Most all the shots I've taken are pretty soft at all settings...  All cameras have a \"sweet\" spot but so far I've not been able to find one with this camera.  14 whopping MP and you can't crop in more than a couple of steps before the shot turns to a mess.  I don't want to post photos here since most any will look good at the greatly reduced display size showing on Amazon.The Z5010 lists \"IS\" Image stabilization but I can't see that it works much or at all, so many motion blur shots without that much hand shake on my part.  Same with the video ISStart up times from off are pretty good at around 4 secondsControls are fast and easy to useFast one button press to go from camera to photo review and back again... very niceUsing AA batteries can be both good and bad depending on how you look at them.  Lithium packs charge quicker, hold their charge longer when not in use and take more photos per charge, but AA cells are cheaper and can be upgraded as others come out with more capacity etc.Once you are used to using a single Lithium pack it's hard to go back to messing with multiple cells, but otherwise they are no real problem.  Max on the market as of this date is 2700mah but brands DO vary in quality and length of useful life.A faster \"smart\" charger is needed along with a second set of cells to have with you if you plan to take lots of photos.  Not a brand recommendation but as sample; Combo: Tenergy T-3150 Smart AA/AAA NiMH/NiCd Battery Charger + 4 Premium AA 2500mAh NiMH Rechargeable Batteries there are many brands and kits out there, just make sure it's \"Smart\" so it reads the cells and adjusts itself for best charge.Internal memory is only 90mb so you don't get to save much without a SDHC card inserted.No memory card supplied so be sure to purchase a good high speed card with lots of room if you plan to record HD video, for example;PNY Professional 16 GB Class 10 Hi-Speed SDHC 20MB/s 133x Flash Memory Card P-SDHC16G10-EF (Black)PNY Professional 8 GB Class 10 Hi-Speed SDHC 20MB/s 133x Flash Memory Card P-SDHC8G10-EF (Black)  Internal memory is only 90mb so you don't get to save much without a card inserted.  Prices of lower class 4 & 6 cards are not that much cheaper to not get a class 10.25mm on the wide end is nice... but they dropped this one to f3.1 from the Z990s f2.8 specWay too much CA (Chromatic aberration) also21x zoom magnification (25 - 525mm) is also down from what they already had in the 30X MAX(the last 5x of zoom is digital so you might want to keep away from using that unless you really need to, see the bar graph on screen when zooming)No manual focus so if it will not AF you are out of luckLCD is lowered to 230K resolutionKodak used a regular CCD not the BSI CMOS they already have on the market.  Even a regular CMOS would be improvement.Highest ISO is 1600 down from their best 3200 & 6400 on other model....although, the Z5010 does not do well with low light high ISO noise even at 1600 with this CCDHD video is better quality for me than stills so far, except for the fact that it does not have optical zoom feature while you are taking videos...  a pretty common desire for most people.You still have 5X digital zoom to use, but quality drops the more you zoom out with digital rather than optical.  Please note that I confirmed this lack of \"optical\" zoom in video mode with Kodak customer service directly and is not an opinion or mistake on my part.Resolution is also down from full 1080 to 720 from the MAX z990Video records fast and smooth at 720 HD when used with a good class 10 high speed card.Even for rapid succession \"burst\" still shots, the link between memory card and camera has to be as fast as it can be in order to not get backed up and slowed down causing problems.Please do yourself a favor if you are considering this Kodak camera and have a look at the full specs and features of their other new (Jan 2011) camera. Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 (New Model)  I can't say it would please me for picture quality any more than the Z5010 but you will sure get more camera for the small price difference, and at times even less money than the Z5010.UPDATE 11/2011;  I found when taking videos with the Z5010... no matter what size memory card you use in it, in any one video you can only record 2 GB (about 10 minutes) of HD720p and only 2 GB (about 25 minutes) at lowest res VGA setting!  Thought it was malfunction but found it listed in the manual.Now at the 600 shot mark with this camera. The camera, even with a high speed memory card ,is pretty slow \"processing\" the more you use it in an outing and you can miss many shots waiting for the last photo to finish writing to memory card.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice 21X Optical Zoom, OK Picture Quality, Bulky", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R3G25AXDFT2NIR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I'd like to say that if you already own or prefer Kodak cameras, you will probably like this one.  I think Kodak has a large following of brand-loyal users who have stuck with Kodak since film camera days. Kodak isn't my first choice for digital cameras; my opinion is the Fuji line has better picture quality. The pictures I've taken with this camera are too soft for my own personal preference.  Maybe you like softer photos though. I also found it odd that outdoors on an overcast day at 4 PM that the flash would pop up and fire when on other cameras it would not under the same circumstances. I couldn't decide whether to give this camera 3 or 4 stars, it's OK and I like it, but there are other better cameras I love.PROS:>  The Mode Dial seems substantial and I like the clicking sound it makes when dialing it.>  Burst Mode (easy access on top of camera shared with self-timer button):  You can hold the shutter down and take up to 31 pictures at once, depending on the picture size you have chosen - this ranges from 8 to 31 shots, one after another (but you cannot use the flash with burst).>  HD videos - 720p and they seem fairly decent quality so far - I uploaded a short video on YouTube under the user name Yarii41.>  You can choose to put the date on the picture (or not) in the set-up menu.CONS:>  Battery compartment door is flimsy. A little hard to close and latch down with the batteries inside.>  Zooming out to 21X can be somewhat blurry - a tripod is ESSENTIAL if you can't keep the camera steady.>  Lens cap - I prefer the other style that opens/retracts when the camera is turned on/off.  This lens cap is designed like those found on DSLR cameras, but it will go flying off if you don't have it tethered to the neck strap and forget to remove it before powering the camera on. I forget to remove it and get a \"lens obstructed\" error message.ZOOMING DURING VIDEO:  You can't use the OPTICAL zoom DURING the video.  You have to zoom out before pressing the shutter button. You CAN zoom with this Kodak DURING the video, but it's strictly digital zoom, so it will be somewhat grainy and not as good quality.This is a hefty camera; it's plastic, but not cheap, thin plastic. It comes with 4 rechargeable AA batteries and a very slow charger.  Painfully slow, so I recommend getting some Sanyo Eneloops (see link below) along with a faster charger.The shutter lag time is fast. I rarely miss the shot while waiting on the shutter to respond. It's fast when using no flash, and seems maybe a second or 2 slower when using the flash, because the flash has to pop up/open. BUT -- recycling time (when it's ready to take the next picture) takes 2 to 3 seconds using the flash, probably due to the camera using AA batteries; my cameras that use lithium batteries are much faster. So if you have a baby, or young grand-kids, or even pets, you may miss a shot waiting for the camera to be ready for the next shot.NOTE: The manual says to use an SDHC Card with a MINIMUM Class 4 rating;  however, in my opinion, Class 4 is not good enough.  I think at least a Class 6 but preferably a Class 10 rating - they don't cost that much more and you will be happier when shooting videos with a Class 10 SDHC card.  Camera does not come with an SD card, you need to purchase one separately, there is some internal memory, but not enough to take any more than a couple pictures.On the Mode Dial you can choose \"M\" for manual control should you desire - you can set your own aperture, shutter speed, flash compensation and ISO. Likewise, if you are completely camera-challenged, just leave the Mode Dial turned to Smart Capture and let the camera do everything for you.  There's also a P setting (Program Mode) and several scene modes, but normally I leave it on the Smart Capture setting so I don't have to fiddle around with settings.SOFTWARE:  There is no Kodak software CD in the box.  The software is stored on the camera and you go through a set-up the first time the camera is connected to your computer.  For some reason it didn't work right (using Vista) so I had to download the \"Share Button App\" from Kodak's web site. I wasn't impressed by it.BOTTOM LINE:  This isn't a small camera.  You'll be happy with this camera if you already know you like Kodak and don't mind it being large, bulky and heavy, it weighs over 16 ounces.  It takes decent pictures and the zoom is excellent.  This SLR-style camera demands its own bag, it won't fit in your pants pocket unless you are wearing MC Hammer's parachute pants.Sanyo Eneloop Batteries:  Sanyo XX Battery Powered by eneloop, 2500mAh High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ultrazoom for Picture Takers", "Author": "Patrick Oden", "ReviewID": "R14PILF7WM4TFV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A friend of mine asked the other day why anyone would buy a camera when their iphone took such quality pictures.  Now this guy isn't a rube who thinks an iphone is the best quality out there, he knows that there are expensive cameras that take professional quality pictures are out there, DSLRs they are called.  He wasn't dismissing those as much as he was questioning the need for the point and shoot models. Those are the cameras for people who don't fancy themselves photographers, they just want to take pictures.That's the group I'm in.  I like taking pictures, good pictures even, and often lots of them.  But I don't want to spend  a lot of time thinking about the camera or the lighting or the shot quality.  I see something I like, I want to take a picture of it.I have professional photographers for friends and while I envy their fancy cameras, and the pictures they take, I know I don't have the interest to put in the time to learn the details about all the specific settings, and the lingo that goes with it. I know a little, enough to get by, but like I said I just want to take pictures.And because I often want to take pictures of things that are far away, like birds or scenery or other distant objects, I love the ultrazoom category of cameras that have arisen in the last decade.  They provide a great ability to zoom in, without having to pay thousands of dollars for a fancy lens.My first ultrazoom was the Canon S2IS, which I loved.  When it finally broke, I got a SX20IS.  I like it, though honestly I think the S2IS took better pictures.  While the larger megapixel size (14MP!) sounds more impressive, the trouble is that the sensor in the camera doesn't really translate higher quality, just bigger picture size.  Pictures come out softer, with fuzzier details, and need more digital post-processing (Photoshop!).Those cameras cost about $400 new.  Which made me very interested in this Kodak z5010.  Having a fair amount of experience with point and shoot ultrazooms, I have a pretty mixed opinion of this camera now that I've played around with it a while.First off, the feel of it is noticeably cheaper.  It has the plastic feel of a cheap camera, with a very simple layout.  The LCD screen is large but of a low quality, and there's no viewfinder to look through, so the LCD is all you have, making it a little tricky to see the quality of the picture taken.  But with cheap comes easy, and so it this camera is quite user friendly. You can pick it up and play with it right off the bat.  Everything is clearly labeled and each setting provides a little instruction on the screen when chosen.So, a minus for how it feels, but a plus for how easy it is to use.As far as picture quality, well, it's not nearly as good as my canon cameras.  The image quality is decent at close up, but at the far reaches of the zoom, everything becomes grainy and distorted, feeling more like a digital zoom (which uses the software to mimic zoom).  The edges were extremely soft, and the same scene taken with both this kodak and my canon shows significantly more blur with the Kodak, especially as the picture is examined at full size.However, there's that price difference.  This camera costs about half as much as my canon.  This is an important point, as so often cameras are divided into only two categories: the DSLRs and the Point and Shoots.  However, within each category there are significant differences among needs and cameras kinds.  There are point and shoot cameras which try to provide a near DSLR experience.  And there are point and shoots which are good for holiday pictures and family shots.  The latter are a lot less expensive, are more user friendly, and offer a lot less options.And that's precisely where this Kodak fits in, an ultrazoom for those who are more concerned with ease of use than options.  It's a camera for someone who likes the quality of their smartphone pictures, but wants to be able to zoom in more and take a wider variety of shots.  What kind of wider variety?  Well, it has a very easy panoramic mode, much better than my canon, that shows the previous picture taken so you can line up the next ones (thus negating the need for more steps afterwards in software).  It provides the ability to change focus and shutter speed and other options, while also giving a lot of presets for different settings and needs.So, this camera definitely fills a niche.  It's a great camera for those who just want to enjoy taking and sharing pictures.  And sharing is probably its stand out feature.  You can set it up to tag specific people automatically, then upload the tagged photos to facebook or email or flickr or a bunch of other sites.  In effect, the camera in general is made to avoid the need for any software adjustments or middle steps.It's a camera that provides a decent picture and great sharing options, made for the niche of folks who just are documenting their fun, not making the photography the goal.  It's about half the cost of other higher end point and shoot ultra zooms, making it more accessible to a wider audience, but the trouble is that for only a little more you can get it's reputably higher quality brother ultrazoom, the Z990.  So, for this present model to be worth it, I'd say it would have to come down in price another 30% or more, as it is much more suitable for the under 150 dollar market in terms of quality.Would I recommend it?  Yes, to specific people who want an easy to use camera with a fair amount of features and aren't particular about overall quality and who don't want to mess around with software. But, again, I'd suggest checking out the Z990 model instead. If the price is anywhere near each other, that is the much better choice .", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great alternative to SLR", "Author": "T Rose \"T Rose\"", "ReviewID": "R26ZG7BDZTX5O7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been disappointed with several point and shoot digital cameras I've used in the past. I was also hesitant to spend a fortune on an SLR.I purchased the Nikon Coolpix L120 and was thrilled with it's features and performance.When I was given the opportunity to try the Kodak EasyShare Z5010 I was excited to compare the two.The size and shape are nearly identical.The features and performance are also just about dead on but the Nikon wins out on zoom features.The Kodak EasyShare is GREAT if:You are looking for a camera that is a step up from the traditional point and shoots.You don't mind the larger size. This will NOT fit in your pocket.You are looking for a camera to take indoor and outdoor pictures.You want high quality shots without a huge price tag.My only complaint (and it goes for the Nikon as well) is that I have a hard time getting group shots of kids.  You need to depress the button halfway to get it to recognize and focus on the people and by the time you press it all the way to take the shot invariably someone has moved so they are fuzzy when everyone else looks perfect.Overall I highly recommend this camera.

The camera is easy to use, and the zoom is incredible! I went from a 3x Zoom to a 21x times zoom.When zooming, I read online that the zoom gets really fuzzing and gives crappy quality pictures, it really doesn't! They are very nice! If you are like me, then your hands shake when you're trying to take a really good picture, well my hands still shake and i'm not going to tell you that the picture isn't fuzzy but i will say that only 2 in 10 are fuzzy rather than 7 in 10.

I had high hopes for it, and though it worked, it wasn't nearly as impressive as I hoped.  It takes a little bit of customization, is NOT WIFI capable (which would have been better) and I don't think it would be very useful for most users.  HOWEVER, I think this would be great for a teenager -someone who's really interesting in sending lots of pictures to various friends.  (You have to preprogram people's email addresses in the camera, and then you have to hook a cable up to your computer, and then you have to select which users you want to send pictures to, and then they are sent.  I, personally, would rather just drag and drop the pictures and email them on my own separately.)  I didn't add any stars or deduct any stars for this feature, but I wanted to point it out...Another note.  There is a cap (to protect the lens) and a string you can use to attach the cap to the camera (so that you don't lose it).  This is great, except for one problem.  The cap then can hang in front of the camera and block your picture.  You have to be careful to avoid the cap (or hold it) while taking a picture.  Of course, you also have the option to not attach the string to the cap and camera and then just remove the cap manually when taking pictures...PROS:+++ SIMPLE TO USE.  If you are giving this to someone who is camera shy (but secretly wishes they could take pictures) then this is a great camera to give.  It is relatively intuitive, and you don't have to read an instruction manual if you've used other smaller cameras by either Canon, Sony, or Kodak.+++ GREAT ZOOM.  It has 21X Zoom.  This is probably the biggest, most impressive, function of this camera.  I would highly recommend it for someone who takes a lot of nature photography, as you can really get in close, with this pretty inexpensive camera.++ TAKES REGULAR BATTERIES.  This is a plus if you don't want to invest in purchasing additional proprietary batteries (for another brand and model of camera).  For people who want things very simple, there isn't much simpler than this: if your batteries run down, go to any store to buy normal AA replacements.++ HD VIDEO CAPABLE.  Though not 1080i (which I wouldn't expect at this price-point), this camera takes respectable 720 HD video.  This is a very nice feature.++ EDITING ON CAMERA.  This camera allows you to edit on the camera.  I thought that THAT was pretty neat.++ MULTIPLE PICTURE BURSTS.  This camera allows you to choose a setting which will take multiple bursts of pictures, allowing you to catch an action without having to wait for the typical slow recycle time before taking another picture.CON:-- NO OPTICAL ZOOM ON VIDEO.  You cannot zoom in or out when taking video.  This is a pain, but then again, for this price, because this is not a dedicated video camera, it is not a deal killer.  (But, buy something else if you really want to take a lot of videos.)-- SLOW RECYCLE SPEED.  Once you take a picture you have to wait several seconds before taking another and seeing how it turns out.  This can be moderately annoying when you are in a group setting and have to wait a bit before trying to take another picture.- BULKY.  This is not a real negative, because you are buying a camera with a huge zoom, and the camera, therefore, HAS to be bulky-ish.  Just realize that it is pretty big and has to be carried over your shoulder or in a bag (and not in a pocket).- NO MANUAL FOCUS.  If you are comfortable always using automatic features then this won't be a problem.  But, if you want a camera that allows you manual focus control then look at other models instead.For someone who is really in to cameras or picture taking I would give this product 3 stars.  For beginners I would give this camera 4 stars.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kodak EasyShare Z5010", "Author": "SevereWX", "ReviewID": "RR4HGJKVQJQHU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What the Kodak EasyShare Z5010 camera is, is an easy to use entry level camera that is based primarily on automatic picture modes. It's for people who just want to point a camera at things, press a button, and get sharp, accurately exposed photographs in return. The Kodak EasyShare Z5010 does those things with relative ease. There are a few hiccups along the way, but considering this camera's price-point, noone should be expecting a high end DLSR packed into a point & shoot body; you simply aren't going to find that in any entry level consumer P&S; camera, plain and simple.This camera does take sharp photographs, with accurate exposure in fair to excellent lighting conditions. The pictures start to get a little too noisy for my taste over ISO 400 however, so it wouldn't be my first choice for low light or night photography. The automatic flash exposure is set a bit strong by default and washes things out in most instances. With this camera, I found it's better to try to compesate the flash exposure by -2/3 stop, which allows the flash to act more as subtle fill flash. Another option is to put a piece of clear cellophane tape over the flash, which is a cheap and non-destructive way of diffusing the light in a more pleasant manner.The automatic focus point is a bit fidgity, it likes to wander all over the place searching for things to focus on, but since most of the modes used have tend to take pictures with a large depth of field, its mostly a non-issue for average snapshots.What this camera does well:* Takes sharp, crisp photos. Only at the very extreme focal lengths do the images start getting soft on the corners. Pincushion and barrel distortion are minimal, which is is a very pleasant surprise!* No purple fringing issues noticeable in high contrast situations. This is exceptional for a camera of this price point.* Share button app is simple, fun, and easy to use. If ever there were a social networking point & shoot camera, this is the one to have.* Well balanced, easy to grip, buttons and control are convenient. Not too big, not too small. Juuuuuuust right.*Menu system is easy to navigate and understand. Nothing archaic here, and no submenus of submenus to get lost in. Kodak deserves a huge pat on the back for this one.The camera lacks several things that I find noteworthy:* There is no optical viewfinder. I find the lack of an optical viewfinder disconcerting. While the LCD display is mostly useable, it's not nearly as nice when tracking moving objects as would be when using a viewfinder. This is especially true when trying to take videos.* There are no Aperature Priority and Shutter Priority modes. You either get full auto, a manual mode, and lots of scene modes that usually offer less creative control than the two noteably missing modes mentioned.* There is no hot-shoe for adding an optional hot-shoe flash. While that is rarely found on compact point & shoot cameras, nearly every camera could benefit from this simple addition.* Battery life is mediocre at best with the supplied rechargeable batteries. I highly recommend getting a few sets of Sanyo Eneloop batteries to power this. Not only will you get more exposures per charge, but you'll also have the benefit of the batteries holding their charge in storage for a much longer period of time. Chuck the charger they send with it in the junk drawer and get a smart charger with automatic refresh and bad battery detection; your rechargeable batteries will live a much longer life if you do this simple thing.So is it good enough to rate the four stars I gave it? Yes, I think it's very good for the general market it was aimed for. While some of the features feel too dumbed down as far as allowing users more control over their pictures, the final outcome is still that of photographs with exceptional picture quality.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good (Easy) Camera", "Author": "Cotton", "ReviewID": "R1U40RDKCDCFR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, for all you people out there that won't touch a camera with all \"those\" knobs and buttons to push, well, this is the camera for YOU!!

This camera's functionality is not at all hard to to familiarize. Although Kodak would certainly not be a first choice for me as far as bridge camera's are concerned, having the chance to own one and compare it to my personal bridge camera which is Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18k is where I will be basing this review. I am not a pro but my photographic skills are beyond the novice level. I have 2 bridge cameras (both Panasonic Lumix models FZ50k and FZ18k) and one compact (Samsung ST100) that serves as a back up.At first glance, the Kodak EasyShare Z5010 Digital Camera looks modern and stylish. The curvature of the camera fits my hand in a secure fashion. The grips are made in such a way that unless you totally let go, it will not slip while you grasp the camera. And since this camera does not have a viewfinder, there is where this curvature plays a major role. The camera's lens is top notch Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon with a 21x zoom and optical image stabilization. With a zoom and image stabilization like this, you can be assured of breath-taking close up shots with minimal shake. I found this especially true when I tried to focus on a boat by the lake. The boat was a few miles away but the image seems to be just a few feet away. The lens also pulls back to a nifty 25mm where you can truly have a wide angle. This is wider than my FZ18k which is set at 28mm. Where other bridge camera's IS is electronic, the Z5010 stands out in this category. The resolution is great at 14MP. This is almost double compared to a mere 8.1MP for my Lumix.Functionality is very user friendly. The controls, especially the mode dial are pretty much standard for bridge cameras. So if you currently own one, you will have minimal difficulty trying to set the dial to your desired mode. The video feature is great enabling you to take HD 720p resolution videos. My Lumix just takes regular resolution. It is powered by 4 AA rechargeable Ni-MH batteries or your can use the regular AA's. Note however that with rechargeables, your ability to avoid lag time increases and video times short since unlike regular batteries, rechargeables looses the power hold while not in use.The material of the camera is mostly plastic where I felt is one of the downside of the camera. Where my Lumix was a mix of both plastic and metal, the Z5010 is mostly plastic. Despite the material, it still feels heavy and bulky. It takes SDHC cards which are pretty much standard. ISO sensitivity ratings goes up to 1600 but taking low light pictures past the 400 mark, I noticed a lot of noise. And no amount of adjustment seems to reduce the noise. It does take superb, sharp pictures with proper lighting. Using this on a clear day, produces outstanding results. Control configurations are adequate. Once it is in your grip, it's not hard to reach and manipulate buttons and dials.After all that's said and done, this camera is geared for the consumer with less aptitude towards creative photography. The absence of a viewfinder can attest to that fact. For more endearing photographic objectives, my Lumix camera's are still and the only choice.

I use them both for photographing birds and scenery and for close up shots of crafts and cooking for my blog.I don't use them for videos.This camera is a less expensive with less zoom than the other bridge superzoom cameras I have. 21x optical is a very good amount. I do have the Kodak EasyShare Max Z990 (New Model).Compared to the Z990, the Z990 has more zoom and it's a bigger camera in terms of size. The zoom control on this camera is on the back of the camera, and there is no view finder. Other than those, this is a very similar camera to the Z990.Pros:Great low-light camera for still objectsVivid colors on scenery shots- captures the colors of the mountains and other scenery in the Anchorage area very wellGood image stabilization21x optical zoomDetailed close up shots or macro shots are very crisp, as long as you don't try to zoom in on it and the camera is about 6 inches away from what you're photographing.Cons:Has the same issue as the Z990 about trying to zoom in close on something 5 feet away. I like to take photos of flowers and other things that way sometimes if I can't get close to it. This doesn't focus well in that range when you zoom in on somethingColors can be a little too saturated- some people like that, but it can look garishAuto-focus can be a little iffy- you might have to try a couple times to get the focus on what you want to stand outSince what I need is a camera that does well on my macro shots, I'm giving my husband my Z990, keeping my Fujifilm HS10 and this camera for my photographing needs. The HS10 doesn't take the same quality photos for my crafts and is considerably bulkier than this camera. The HS10 also has lower megapixels, but does a lot better than either Kodak camera for birds and zooming in on something that's in that zone that the Kodaks don't work. It doesn't take low light shots as well or take photos of food or crafts as well.

Burke", "ReviewID": "RAJFL4J1974CC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first picked the Kodak EasyShare Z5010, I was a little disappointed. It feels fairly flimsy, especially without the batteries, and the functionality seems pretty basic. But as I took this camera around a bit more, it grew on me quite a bit. Take as an example the wide-angle lens. There's something about this lens that makes my pictures pop, in my opinion, whereas my other digital cameras often leave pictures with a flat quality. However, the biggest surprise was the ease with which this camera takes panoramic shots. Unlike my other cameras which require a smooth panning motion (fairly tricky to pull off sometimes), this camera allows you to take three easily aligned pictures which it then weaves into a panoramic image.There are, of course, some mediocre aspects of this camera. For example, I found the \"easy share\" feature to be fairly useless. Yes, the camera and software do make it very easy to upload photos, but I feel it's already easy enough to do manually. Speaking of the software, it's nothing to write home about. Most people, including me, have their favorite editing programs, and there's nothing in this package that will draw anybody away.There are other aspects of the camera worth mentioning. The use of AA batteries seems to be something people either love or hate, but given the fact that this camera comes with a battery recharger (plus four rechargeable batteries), I can't complain. The 21x optical zoom is pretty nice, though I think not atypical of a camera like this. The quality of the LCD screen could also be a bit better, but is still more than adequate. Overall, I found these to be very minor drawbacks, and I'm still very happy with this camera.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value for the money", "Author": "Movielighter", "ReviewID": "R1LRSO0Y2UOYHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people think that all camera are the same. I know if I buy a $275.00 camera such as this, it will out shoot my $150 camera, but I cannot expect it to shoot as well as a $500 camera, and so on. Now, this camera has a lot of features and is a nice littl upgrade for someone going from a point and shoot (pocket, purse cam) to something with more options, wider angles and that can let more light into the lens. The zoom is wonderful at 21x, most pocket cams get you only 5x at the most. The SDHC cards are a lot less expensive than most, she paid $24.00 for her 4gb Sony ProDuo in the Summer, an 8gb SDHC card hits around $10.00 (I picked up 3 for her and got free shipping here at Amazon) This was a purchase for my wife to move up from her smaller camera. She did not want one that you had to change lenses and worry about a lot of settings, she loves it. I can out shoot her with my Canon T2i, but it was 3x the amount of $$$ and should be able to do as much. I know the limitations of my cameras, and I work to push them as far as they will go.

I have used this for camera over a month now for everything from family pictures to business product pictures and have come away fairly satisfied with it's capabilities. Here are my observations:Includes:* Camera* Lens Cap* Neck Strap* Battery Charger with 4 AA BatteriesPros:+ Body Size; larger body camera provides for decent grip+ Presets; offers a wide range of preset shooting options including the \"Smart Capture\" mode that features automatic scene selection and image optimization (which is pretty good and the setting I usually default to), manual Scene Selection mode (Fireworks, Portrait, Backlight, Stage, Children, Flower/Macro, etc), and other modes are easy to select directly on the dial including Sports, video (good, but not exceptional), Manual, Program, Portrait, Landscape, and Panorama (stitches pictures together in camera)+ Lens; features a very good wide-angle 21X zoom lens that has limited distortion at either end of the range+ Low Lag; good first shot and follow up speed+ Battery Life; takes 4 AA batteries (included w/charger) and has reasonably good lifeCons:- Software; somewhat lackluster, comes preloaded on camera and installs when connected to the PC (installed second time on my Win 7 laptop), but it is very limited compared to standard editing programs). The \"Share\" button allows preselection of options, such as FaceBook, FlickR, Twitter, email, etc when the camera is connected to PCMisc:* Image Quality; while generally color accurate and acceptable, it is a little \"softer\" than expected for a 14MP cameraThose wanting more control might want consider a different camera but, overall, this is a decent everyday use camera that can be left in \"Smart Capture\" mode for most of my picture taking needs and there is a preconfigured setting for just about everything else.Recommended, with the caveats above.CFH", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Handy point and zoom compact camera - great for taking decent photos with minimal fussing", "Author": "Nathan Andersen \"film lover, philosophy profe...", "ReviewID": "R31852FYFN4JOI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Kodak EasyShare camera is a pretty decent camera for the average user who doesn't want to fuss much, but wants a few more options than you'd get in a low-end compact.  What you get with this one is decent HD video capture (it's 720p, and it looks and sounds at least better than the footage you'd get from a phone), lots of semi-manual options for adjusting exposure, ISO (the digital equivalent of film speed), and shutter speed, and, most importantly, a telephoto lens that allows you to get an optical 21x zoom.  There are also, as usual, a number of pre-set scene settings that take the thinking out of capturing children in a playground, or people with a light behind them, or sunset or sunny days, or self portraits, or candle light.  I like that the most frequently used custom settings - such as portrait and sports and landscape and night landscape - are built in to the knob on top, so that you can set them as quickly as you need without fussing through a menu.  I also like that there's a dedicated button on top for adjusting the flash settings or the focus settings (between autofocus, macrofocus, and infinity focus).  The zoom capacity and the battery chamber are what make this camera a bit more bulky than some of the ultra-compact cameras you can find nowadays.  Some of those allow for most of the adjustments you can get with this one, but usually you have to go through a more complicated menu to get to the right setting, and none of the compacts will deliver an optical zoom nearly as long as this one.  It's a matter of physics: if you want optical zoom, you need a longer lens, and you just can't get that with a tiny camera.Another feature that Kodak touts with this one is a feature I've found to be less useful: the \"EasyShare\" feature.  You can download an application that is supposed to allow you to upload your photos or videos directly to facebook or youtube or any number of other file-sharing devices.  You're supposed to be able to set it up and then it will enable you to automatically share pictures when you press the \"share\" button.  It turns out, it doesn't work, at least not on my Mac.  There is a version of the \"EasyShare\" software that's designed for the Mac.  I don't really need it, since I've got Photoshop and I use their photo downloader to download photos to my computer.  Still, for the purposes of this review, I went ahead and downloaded the version of the program that's made for my operating system.  I went through, and set up the account, and allowed it to access my facebook information, and the instructions explained that when I was finished the \"share\" button on the camera would be activated.  It wasn't.  Pressing the share button, whether I've got the camera on or off, connected to my computer or not, whether I've got the \"EasyShare\" software on or not, does absolutely nothing.  When I have my camera plugged in to the computer, and I turn on the camera, the \"EasyShare\" app turns on and downloads all my photos, according to the way I set it up.  But it doesn't give me any options to share photos on facebook.  To do that I have to do exactly what I used to do: login to facebook and upload the photos from there.  That's not a big deal for me since I'd usually do some adjustments first in Photoshop and then upload them anyhow - but then I don't see what good it does me to have the \"EasyShare\" software because I can already download the photos with Photoshop Bridge or with iPhoto, so this software doesn't do anything for me.  As I mentioned, it may work better on a PC, but on a Mac it seems to be pretty useless since it does something you could already do with software you're bound to have (iPhoto).  So that's not a big deal for me - but if the \"EasyShare\" part of the camera appeals to you and you're on a Mac, it's worth knowing it's not all that useful.Still, apart from the software thing - and even with cameras that I love I've never been much of a fan of the software they came with - this is a pretty handy point and zoom compact camera.  It would be great for the camera novice who wants to learn how to control things a bit beyond what's usually possible with an ultra-compact camera, and especially someone who shoots outdoors where extra optical zoom can really make the difference between whether you can or can't capture what you see.  The convenience of dedicated buttons for the flash, and for focus settings, and quick settings for the most useful automatic settings makes this a very useful camera for the novice.  You can learn what it does fairly quickly, but for standard home uses you could spend a long time satisfied with the quality of the shots you'd get and the memories you'd capture.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Z5010", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R3FEYN67C8580P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is much more than I expected.

I got this camera a few weeks ago from Amazon for $117. Similarly specced cameras from other manufacturers were well over $200.I've owned a few Kodak digital cameras, and I've been fairly pleased with them all. I had an Easy Share C913 before this, which was 9MP with 3x Optical Zoom. With my newfound train photography hobby, that was woefully inadequate. While I would love to be rocking a DSLR, I'm a broke 20something. Not happening any time soon.The smart capture feature is pretty good on its own. I've played with some of the alternate scene settings too, but for the most part the smart scene setting does the job. When I have time, I plan on reading up on the features you can adjust in the manual setting.The zoom is, in most cases fantastic, but you absolutely need to be steady or use a tripod when using it. If the camera is jiggling, it will go blurry.If you're looking for a DSLR - pass. If you want something with an awesome zoom and you're not a photography expert, this should do wonders.Example images can be found on Flickr, my name on there is RunningWithScalpels - Amazon won't let me link. (The pictures in the photo stream with file names like 100_0001, ect are from this camera. Other images are from my phone, which are completely irrelevant here.Video capability is okay, it shoots 780 HD - but I have a Kodak Playsport ZX3 from Ebay that I use primarily for video, and that can shoot 1080. However, the zoom on this is way better, so now my usage varies between this and the pocket video camera depending on what I'm shooting.The battery life could be better - takes 4 AA at a time, comes with a set of rechargeables and a crappy charger. However if they die on you when you're out and about, AA batteries are not too difficult to find, so that's convenient.Overall, for $117, this camera was a fantastic purchase.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "CollegeCultivator \"LEARN LAUGH TEACH\"", "ReviewID": "R29TK7YCH3M2LL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for someone that wants to take great pictures without spending a ton of money.

I am a bit disappointed in both.It may be unfair to compare this camera at under $200 to a camera that cost about twice that. However, the Kodak feels cheap and the pictures (other than those taken in very bright light) look soft and grainy.The share feature works to easily upload photos to sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and many others, but it tacks on a tag about the camera that I had to manually delete for each photo. There does not seem to be a way to set the default NOT to mention the camera. I had forgotten how bad Kodak software can be. (I have a Kodak zi8 video camera that I love, but the software is useless.) Kodak also uses a special formatting for the SD card, so when I move the card between this camera and my Panasonic it has to read and \"process\" any photos taken by the Panasonic. I am not sure if that is the camera or the software doing it, but it is annoying either way.The camera takes 4 - AA batteries. It includes the batteries and a charger. It takes a LONG time to charge the included batteries, but I was able to use the camera with standard non-rechargeable batteries right away and they seem to last quite a while. I haven't had to replace them so far. The cover for the battery compartment is difficult to close and feels very flimsy. I suspect that will be the first thing to break.This might be a good camera for someone who wants to take photos primarily for online use. It is easy to take photos, and they should look fine in the sizes and resolutions commonly used online. There are lots of modes (e.g., portrait, sports, landscape, burst, etc.) that make it simple to get good shots. The camera responds quickly and has modes, such as burst, that allow you to take several photos in a short time.One thing I especially like about this camera is the Panoramic mode. Choose Panorama, then take your first shot. The camera displays a piece of that shot on the LCD screen, over the lens view. Line up the piece of the previous shot with what you see on the screen and take the second picture. Repeat. The camera then stitches the shots together--no need for photo editing software. It is easy, especially if you use a tripod to keep the camera steady and level while taking the shots. Even without a tripod, though, you can get a seamless panoramic image.

All have their specific purposes during my picture taking.  I played around with this camera since October.  As compared to my other cameras:LIKES:-Easy to use.-Decent zoom.-Uses regular batteries.  I take a lot of pictures and can easily wear out the first set of batteries.  I always bring along another set of either recharged or alkalines just in case.-Bulky.  I like the feeling of an camera that I can get a firm grip on and not hold daintily, like the pocket cam.DISLIKES:-Viewfinder.  Just my preference, but I like to look through it, I don't like looking at the screen, especially on a sunny day.  It's nearly impossible to see in bright sun.-Delay when taking multiple pictures.  I can normally take two or three consecutive shots, albeit with a delay, but the delay on this one bothers me, a lot.  Almost like it's struggling to save my previous picture.  I've tried different classes of memory cards and the result is always the same.-If you turn the camera on without taking the lens off, you get an annoying error message that the cap was left on.  Even if you try and pop that cap off right away after you've turned it on, the message still shows, even though you can see that the camera also sees something on the screen.  Too much of a delay IMO to resolve itself.-LCD has low resolution.  Not a dealbreaker, but an annoyance.-Share button is useless to me.  So is on-camera editing; I use Fuji Finepix & HP & Irfanview software for my editing preferences.-Untrue: \"Intelligent capture control--automatically adjusts camera exposure, focus, and ISO for clear pictures in any environment, even in low light\".Horrible results (blurry, fuzzy) in low light situations.  This has become a given with most digital cameras, in all the camera's I've tried.-Another difference from any other camera is that when I plug it into the computer, it tries to download the photos using whatever is installed on the camera.  If I want to use my Fuji Finepix software, I have to copies the photos, put them into a temporary folder, and only then can I import and save my photos using the Fuji software.  Any other camera is easily identified and files accessible in Windows Explorer; this camera is not.  Major annoyance.  I purchased an SD card reader thumb drive which makes transferring photos 100% easier.  I'll have to play with Windows/Device Manager to see if there's a way to change the way it handles things.For a beginner or for outdoor pictures on a bright sunny day, this would be a pretty good camera, but for the novice photographer, I wouldn't recommend it.My 11yo is very interested in photography and takes great pictures on my Olympus (as well as my other cameras).

And possessing some neat advanced features -- that you may or may not ever use.And for the most part so far, I haven't. If I had, I'd be DSLR-ready, already.  Instead, this is my 3rd Kodak in this class, the first being a Kodak Easyshare P880, purchased around 2006.  A few years later, I added to the family with the Kodak Easyshare 712IS, which in some ways was an improvement.  It didn't go wide as impressively as the P880, but boy could it zoom -12X optical, vs. the P880's 5.8X.  (I'll mention too that both cameras are still working, having weathered moderate but not always careful family usage over the years, with aplomb.)The Z5010 blows both of my previous cameras out of the water, of course, with 21X optical zoom, but in many ways it seems a backwards-evolutionary step.  For one example, there's the \"chromatic aberration\" referred to here by many reviewers.  Please see my un-retouched photo uploads on the product page:  I took a picture of autumn leaves with the Z5010 one bright October day, returned a few days later with the 712IS to take another shot of the same tree (unfortunately couldn't find the exact same spot in the tree) - you can see how the red just takes over with some of those sunlit leaves as photographed with the Z5010.  The 712IS shows much more mottling, veining, and gradations of color, even with the reddest of the leaves (pictures taken at same time of day, same cloudless bright sunlight peeking through).Another example:  I've uploaded two photos of chrysanthemums taken with the Z5010.  The hue of the yellow mums in the one pretty much matches what I saw.  You can see crisp, clear petals.  The coppery-brown-to-magenta mums I shot, somehow turned to near fuchsia as processed by the Z5010's imaging software (on the default color setting), and particularly in the full-sun right-side portion of the picture, the detail of the petals are lost.  (The left-hand side mums, which are in the shade, fares somewhat better.)  Compare that to my shot of the same mums taken with the 712IS - a similar color distortion persists with the older camera, but the delineation of individual petals is clearly superior.The Z5010 has been much compared with the also recently released Kodak Z990, which in addition to having 30X optical zoom, includes several advanced features not available on the Z5010, including optical zoom capacity while video recording, and RAW image support.  That latter feature was available on my old P880, but not with the 712IS - if the Z5010 is to be taken as the next step in that moderately priced line, there are two confusing considerations:  1) The Easyshare Z990, as of this writing, is only a tiny bit more expensive than the Z5010; 2) I'd expect to see features added on as the technology matures, not taken away.  It seems to me that Kodak has bet everything on the superzoom lens with the Z5010, and held the price point by sacrificing where the rest of the camera is concerned.  And again, with a price differential so inconsequential between two sibling models released in the same year - I don't get it.  It is as though the Z5010 was conceived solely to make the Z990 look good.One concession made I'm finding particularly tough to live with is the absence of an optical viewfinder.  I didn't know how much I'd miss it, but now am really hoping that going all-electronic/LED view screen vs. optical is NOT the trend.  Between glare off my eyeglasses and glare from the LED view screen (which also washes out in bright sunlight), it can be very difficult to frame a picture.  Unless I can find a \"still\" camera in the future with an LED screen that is tilt/adjustable in the same way as some camcorders, I'll insist on the old-style viewfinder in the future.I'm glad that Kodak has quit with the proprietary camera batteries and chargers that can be hard to find and expensive to replace.  The longer lag (recharge?) time between shots, vs. lithium, I'm not so crazy about.The body (shape and weight) of this camera is very much like my old P880, which took some readjusting, but unless a scant pound of camera overtaxes your wrists, it's not much of an issue - I don't believe anything with this power of lens will slip into a pocket, in the first place.I still love the Kodak Easyshare software, although I prefer my own antiquated version of Photoshop for image editing.  It's nice that I can upload photos directly to my Kodak ESP 2170 All-in-One Printer (see my review) from the camera or SD card, but as a practical matter, my pictures don't get printed until I've cropped or color corrected or at least viewed them in enlarged detail on my computer screen.The Kodak Easyshare interface is one I've gotten comfortable with, and being able to go from playing with the manual settings to idiot-proof point-and-click clearly works for consumers like - well - me.  I actually love that.  Beyond practical considerations, I would hate to see Kodak become another great American company to NOT survive the great globalization.In short: the Z5010 is a mixed bag.  I'll go along with many a reviewer and suggest looking at the oddly-not-much-more-expensive Z990, when comparing to a range of brands.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "The worst Camera to take photos ever", "Author": "Debedeb", "ReviewID": "R3PCDKMR9XT2U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros: Zooom, Grip, looks good,Cons: Slow, two manual controlls, cheap, focus is slight, hard to work, controls are confusing, misses shots, slowest camera ever.

I ordered it 2 day shipping even though that was made the total higher because I needed it asap.  This was listed as NEW and the box label says NEW.  It is NOT new.  It is not even \"gently\" used.  The LCD, Lens, Flash, etc are all COVERED in scratches and finger prints.  The lens cap is so loose from repeated use it fell off before I got it out of the box.  The items were all tossed into the box in a big pile.  Papers wrinkled and crammed in, user guide well worn, all items were unwrapped and unpackaged.  I've got a camera I bought new from Kodak so I KNOW this is NOT how they send out their new items.  The thing stinks as well- like old basement mold and smoke. There was HAIR in the box, camera battery door, and the \"resealed\" box sticker.  I am LIVID.  The box was opened and resealed as was obvious by not just the worn out box but the hair in it and the torn cardboard pieces.  All the paperwork was dirty and just wadded into the very used box.  The battery pack was not only opened but obviously used.  One battery was leaking.  This item is already WORE OUT and not at all as listed.  Also compared to my old Kodak it is VERY CHEAPLY MADE...  plastic and rubber and not much better than a cheap disposable camera would be.  Total waste of TIME AND MONEY.  I am LIVID!!!!  BUYER BEWARE THIS SELLER LIES.  I took lots of pictures.  This camera is in such bad shape I wouldn't have paid $20 for it at a pawn shop!  I am sending it back and boy am I MAD.  >.< It is beyond my comprehension how any reputable company could look at the box alone and list it as new but the camera inside is so thoroughly used that it should not have ever even been resold had it been marked as USED. I just cannot express how very disappointed and angry I am.  My purchase was through \"The Corner Store\" which somehow has a good rating.  I don't know how that can be if they send out such badly used items and list them for new prices and mark them as \"new\".  =/", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great pictures", "Author": "ValF15", "ReviewID": "R2VIV3L254P1CY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a very simple point and shoot I've had for a few years.

You can easily swap them out for another set and they are a lot cheaper than a lithium pack.The camera body feels cheap but at the same time sturdy, an odd description I know but that is the best way I can describe it. The hand grip has a rubberized insert to help you keep your grip on it. A good portion of the cameras weight is in the batteries. You could substitute lithium batteries for those times that you want to lighten your load. Don't get me wrong though, the camera isn't heavy even with the rechargeable batteries. The controls are easy to use and the buttons give a strong positive click when activated. The mode wheel feels great, it has knurling on the side and gives a satisfying feel and click as it moves into each position. The screen is a lower resolution screen but that is to be expected at this price point. The screen has a fast refresh rate that seems to keep up with the action. There is also a focus assist lamp and a pop-up flash.I stuck a Adata Class 10 32GB SDHC card in the camera and it worked without a problem. My Nikon hates that card and will not work with it. I have not experienced a problem using it in the Kodak.The camera takes OK video. This isn't a \"video\" camera but the results in the video department are acceptable. The built in mic seems to do a pretty good job of picking up audio too. One thing I see in some of the other reviews is that you can't zoom when taking video. I did not experience that, I am able to use optical zoom while taking video. The motor noise is audible during playback but is not too obnoxious. I am using the firmware that came on the camera (1.01).This camera needs a good light source to get good pictures. You get a lot of grain in the lower light pictures even with the flash. I also saw a lot of photos with blown out areas in brighter lighting and purple fringing common in cheaper cameras. Playing around with the settings I found I got better results by using the P mode and playing with the exposure compensation. I don't think this will fly for most people who will be using the camera as a point and shoot on auto.I turned my wife loose with the camera for a couple of weeks and she found the camera easy to use overall but complained about the ease of using the battery door. It gave her some problems and I will agree it isn't the easiest door I have used. After I got the camera back from her I went over the pictures that she took. Most of her pictures were taken outside in auto and exhibited the blown out areas, purple fringing, and the zoomed pictures exhibited a lot of grain. Some pictures came out looking pretty good and others probably could have been with manual intervention.Overall keeping in mind the cost for the entire package and results I have seen I will say it is a mixed bag. If you don't mind playing around and experimenting it is just OK. If you are looking to use it in full auto all the time I would say look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "good digital camera for beginners", "Author": "Joe'sMom", "ReviewID": "R36HCCQJ134BV0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "12/12/11: UpdateJust spent the weekend with this camera. Brought this out for our holiday family get-together (so lots of action shots of the kids running around, posed family portraits and a few quick videos.So my absolute favorite thing about the Kodak EasyShare Z5010 is how every setting is clearly labeled, which means that each new setting shows text \"instructions\" on the LCD screen, telling the user which kind of lighting goes best with the setting chosen.  If I turn the wheel to SCN, I see a variety of options and short explainations of what each icon means.I also love that there are some settings I haven't seen on other cameras: including the Children setting (per instructions: \"use for action photos of children in bright light\"), the Candlelight setting, the Stage setting, and the Fireworks setting. Loved playing with the different settings to get the best lighting in different conditions.So in thinking of how this compares to my Canon S5IS (which I take almost everywhere), here is the breakdown of how the Kodak stands up:**Feel of the Camera/Ease of use:  The Kodak has the feel of a less expensive camera. From the lens cap to the battery door, it just doesn't feel that durable.  It is light though, which is a good thing, but overall, my Canon wins hands down. Interestingly though, I was actually less \"protective\" of this camera than I am of my Canon, so I had no problem handing it off to my nieces and nephews to take a few shots. The kids had a great time with it, and because the settings were so user friendly and the layout of the buttons was so easy to follow, they got some decent shots as well. (B)**LCD Screen: The LCD screen is large but the picture was not great quality, and there's no viewfinder to look through, so the LCD is all you have.  That made it a little tough to be sure that I was getting the lighting and focus right. But the pictures turned out better than I would have thought. So while I'm still having trouble getting used to not having an optical viewfinder, it hasn't been much of an issue. (B)**Panoramic Mode: The Kodak has a very easy Panoramic Mode, much better than my Canon, that shows the previous picture taken so you can line up your shots and \"stitch\" them together right within the camera.(A)**Video: I think video quality came out pretty good. The short videos we took came out even better than the still shots actually.  I know there were some complaints from users because they dropped the optical zoom feature from videos but I don't take enough video for this to be an issue for me. (B)**Sharing: Ease of picture sharing is probably this camera's best feature. You can set it up to tag people, then upload the tagged photos to facebook or other sites with the click of a button. This feature was really easy to set up and to use. Had pictures ready for sharing soon after the festivities had ended. (A)**Price: The camera costs about half as much as my Canon. And that is a huge benefit as far as I'm concerned. (A)**Batteries: While Lithium batteries charge quicker, and I think they hold their charge longer, AA batteries are cheaper and can be easier to find if you're out somewhere and see a low battery indicator. My personal preference is AA batteries for just that reason. I know that most camera experts disagree, but it's just my opinion.  The Kodak comes with 4 rechargeable AA batteries and a charger. (A)Overall: It's a great camera for those who just want to enjoy taking and sharing pictures...it's great for online use, it's user friendly, and quality of pictures is fine for posting on Facebook, emailing and printing up to maybe 5x7 or even 8x10 size.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not happy with Kodak", "Author": "never again", "ReviewID": "R114PSI7X1RQR6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my first and last Kodak.
