{"Reviews": [{"Title": "similar to pentax optio S, but slightly bigger", "Author": "jemaerca", "ReviewID": "R2X0AKRQKV4GHH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "pros:- the main selling point of this camera is its small size: 3.4 x 2.6 x 0.9 in, weighing in at 5.1oz.- 3MP resolution, 3x zoom in a very compact package.- average three megapixel resolution.- low image noise at low ISO settings.- allows manual white balance.- has 21 scene modes!- good reliable metering.- low image noise at low ISO settings.- wide range of focus options including manual focus!- histogram display in live view and play modes.- solid build quality.- fast startup time.- cool feature: while in its cradle, pushing the dock's photo button turns the EX-Z3 into a small digital frame: the display shows the images it currently holds, displaying each for several seconds.cons:- no video out capability at all.- some chromatic aberrations.- some vignetting visible.- average photo quality with soft edges.- images noisier than competition.- no buffering means a longer wait before you can take your next shot.- no AF assist light.- high redeye occurrence.- no image parameter adjustment.- blue cast when using flash.- the LCD is a full 2\", but is low resolution.- metal body scratches easily.- only JPEG format is supported.- below average auto focus speed.- longest shutter setting is 1 second.- only 10MB of built-in memory provided so add $$ to your budget to buy external memory.- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare.- you need to remove external memory in order to access images saved in internal memory.the casio ex-z3 is very similar to the pentax optio S with the optio being even more compact than the casio.  as such, they share most of the same strengths as well as issues.  my biggest complaints are the soft images at the corners and the lack of buffering. a camera with better photo quality (but bigger and only has 2x zoom) is canon's sd100.i hope this helps you with your buying decision. peace.", "Date": "September 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "E. Burt", "ReviewID": "R12AX4FS4ESW8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't be fooled becuase it is a Casio. This camera is absloutely excellent. It has numerous special features (double exposure, night, fireworks, and portrait sessions to name a few). I charges quickly, the time between shots is quick as is storage. The viewing function has numerous options, slide shows caledars, zoom, and the movie with sound tops it all off. My previous digital camera cannnot even come close to how great this is. And yes, its really the size of a credit card.", "Date": "June 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Truly fun for point and shoot photograher", "Author": "stabz", "ReviewID": "R1OZNO34B2U5AH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly a fun camera to play with. Here's the deal: you get 3.2megapixil pictures from a machine thats the size of your credit card. What else can you want? It's true that the camera's viewfinder is a bit awkward, but the 2\" display helps a lot. There's a little bit of noise in the pictures but I find the colors come out very well, even in dark settings. The size of the camera makes you want to be delicate with it, but it is made of sturdy materials. The control menu is straightforward, pretty much dummy-proof. Admittedly, the D-pad is small, but one will get used to it in hours. You can see that Casio had to make everything small for the 2\" LCD screen.The Best Shot feature will save you time with adjusting settings. At the same time, there are a couple of manual settings that you can fool around with (the EV shift and ISO settings). The video recording is decent, but it only lasts 30secs - then you'll have to make a new file.  All in all, this is not for the photography enthusiast, but instead for fun snapshooters. Definitely the Canon S-series or the Panasonic Lumix are better candidates if you want the \"camera feel\", but the casio is more of a fashion statement. The looks and design is remarkable. Watching the Pentax lens expand out boggles my mind every time I turn it on. If nothing else, it's the greatest conversation starter. Nothing compares to it (not even the Optio-S). Just take it out in public, people WILL turn heads.", "Date": "July 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Better than the Optio S", "Author": "C. Lee", "ReviewID": "R3EZAAB1EL3SB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I liked the Exilim much better than the Optio S.  I am a current Pentax Optio S owner but had the Exilim previously.  I used the Exilim extensively for my honeymoon and loved it!  The only 2 cons I experienced with the Exilim is 1)the flash is not powerful so not ideal for taking pictures in dim light and 2) the docking station broke after the first month.  If Dell, the reseller, wouldn't have hassled me about replacing the docking station I would not have returned it.I found the Exilim to be much more user friendly and better designed ergonomically.  The 2 advantages of the Optio S is that it performs better under dim lighting and is slightly smaller.  My primary gripe with the Optio is with its super slow shutter speed.  My goal was a simple point and shoot camera to conveniently 'capture the moment' after I have my baby.  Adults can't even sustain a genuine smile/pose long enough for me to take a good candid shot let alone expect an infant to.  I feel like I keep missing the moment vs capturing it.  The downside outweights any potential advantage to me, unless your primary targets are still lifes in dim settings.  Though in most respects both cameras are very comparable, I still think the Exilim is a superior camera overall.  In retrospect, I would've reordered another Exilim.", "Date": "December 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "solid optics,  hate the docking station", "Author": "Amy C.

Pictures are sharp. With release time lag of about 0.01 seconds and a 2-inch LCD screen, it is a real good shot. There are some drawbacks, though: the flash is weak. While the electronic programming allows for just about any kind of picture you want to take, store and manipulate - and more, the menu is not very user friendly. Same with the program to transfer pictures to a computer - it is complicated, not easily understandable. As far as I could see, it has no picture-turning mode, i.e. from horizontal to vertical. It is not possible to burn photos directly from the program to a CD. An additional burn or photo-handling program is needed for that, requiring transferring of pictures, i.e. additional steps. Unless you buy an extra printer (expensive, considering cost of photo-quality printer and relatively high recurrent costs of color cartridges and photo-paper - regular color printers are OK but not great) which allows printing directly from the camera (via the docking station included in the package), you are in for a pretty lengthy process until the pictures are print-ready on a CD.Would I recommend the EX-Z3 3.2MP Digital Camera ? - Yes, by all means. Its neat. But I would also recommend to the manufacturer some improvements along the lines described above, i.e. improved flash capacity and user-friendliness of in-camera programs, as well as those used for downloading / transferring and eventually easy burning of picures on a CD.", "Date": "October 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "No charge!", "Author": "A.
