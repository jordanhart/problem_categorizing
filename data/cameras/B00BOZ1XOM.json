Quick focus. Quality build, feels good in the hands and handles well. All the essential settings and knobs are accessible. Highly recommend if your shooting style is compatible working with a fixed wide angle lens (28mm full frame equivalent). Light, small and unobtrusive. Discrete, not intimidating and doesn't scream \"professional.\" An excellent carry around camera and back up to a full DSLR. Seems a bit pricey, but you're getting what you pay for - high quality images. Great for street scenes and environmental portraiture. I consider the 28mm equivalent lens a bit too wide for tight head shots, but have used it with success in a pinch. I'm a professional documentary photographer and a pro DSLR mounted with a prime 35mm or 85mm is my primary tool of choice; however, there are times when whipping out a large intimidating professional camera wouldn't be appropriate - enter the Coolpix A. I've been looking for a compact carry-around camera that will produce high quality images and this little Nikon fills the bill. I've been shooting the camera extensively for about a month now and have been very pleased with the camera's performance and the images that it's produced. Ensure that shooting with a fixed wide angle lens (28mm FX equivalent) suits your style. If so, then this camera is definitely worth considering. If you want a mirrorless camera that can change lenses or zoom, then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a compact, robust, rugged wide angle fixed lens camera that produces excellent images, the Coolpix A may be for you. Would definitely recommend seriously looking as this camera.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "johnlawrence", "ReviewID": "R35PL9T0CXC2JG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My primary camera is a Nikon D700.  I own several lenses for the D700 but find that my 50mm 1.4G lens stays on it most of the time.  I do all of my serious photography with the D700 but there are definitely times when I don't want to haul a heavy camera with me.  I've been waiting for a small, compact camera from Nikon I can take along for those occasions (vacations, parties, etc).Needless to say, I was excited by the introduction of the Nikon Coolpix A.  I bought one and have been shooting steady with it for the last three weeks.  The camera definitely delivers on the two things I was looking for - small size with outstanding pictures.  Some people find the 28mm lens limiting but I'm accustomed to doing most of my shooting with a prime so it's no problem for me.  I can shoot the camera in program when I just want snapshots for a casual event.  I can also exert complete control when I want to do some serious shooting.  The camera performs flawlessly either way.The only real limitation for me was the lack of a built-in viewfinder.  I purchased the accessory viewfinder for the camera but wasn't too happy about spending so much money just to have a viewfinder.  If you're cooking for a high quality camera that's compact but delivers great pictures, I suggest you take a look at the Coolpix A.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix 'A' (APS-C) Compact Camera review by Dale (updated 7/19/2013)", "Author": "Dale Thorn", "ReviewID": "RC3PLR0BNCJ4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Coolpix A is small enough at 4.5 x 2.6 x 1.6 inches to fit into a closed zippered pouch that fits into an average shirt pocket, yet has a level of image quality that no other pocket camera can approach. I've shot a few samples that potential buyers can find on my website by searching my name. One of those, the bridge in rain and fog at ISO 400, has detail I've never seen in this kind of low-contrast image before. Since the Coolpix 'A' has a fixed 28mm effective focal length lens, it's most suitable for images where no zoom is required, or only moderate cropping would be necessary. This would be landscapes, group people photos, architecture and so on. The macro setting allows shooting no closer than ~4 inches, so the Coolpix 'A' would not be ideal for photographing small insects and similar sized objects.Manual focus with the focus ring surrounding the lens is actually a manually-assisted electronic focus, which may obtain the same end result as a completely manual focus, but I wouldn't assume that the focusing distance it represents in one situation would hold true when the camera is moved and pointed at another subject, unless checking the meter on the screen confirms the proper distance. Focusing manually via the screen image is difficult or impossible without magnifying the image quite a bit, but then you would need to un-magnify to recompose, and that's a hassle. I would like to see a magnified partial frame superimposed on the screen while focusing so that recomposing is unnecessary. Perhaps there's a way to do that now that I haven't discovered.I shoot most of my photos in bursts using the 'Continuous' option, which is a good way to increase the likelihood of getting sharp images when shooting handheld without a support. Since the Coolpix 'A' does not have vibration reduction, but produces highly detailed images, the slightest camera shaking in the hand could cause smearing of details in the photos. The downside of this kind of redundant burst shooting is having to compare multiple images on the computer at 100 percent view to find the sharpest image in the group. The Coolpix 'A's sensor type is 'APS-C', which is so large for this camera size that it required two major developments by Nikon: One, a special lens with a fixed effective focal length of 28mm, and the other a series of \"microlenses\" around the sensor to reduce distortions caused by having the camera's main lens so close to the large sensor.The above developments are not new technology per se, but in making the smallest 'APS-C' camera to date, Nikon had to bend light to a greater degree than anyone else while insuring an undistorted final image. The Coolpix 'A' came with a neck strap only, which is odd given the design for a very small camera body. Since I had several wrist straps on hand, I skipped the neck strap and attached a wrist strap instead. There are lugs on either side of the camera, and strap rings are attached to those, so I removed the plastic protectors on the rings and then removed the rings, then attached the wrist strap to the lug on the right side. If someone wanted to carry the Coolpix 'A' in a pocket, and since dust can work its way into the camera and ruin the sensor, I recommend a small zippered bag like the Coach 'Clutch' series. Mine is 6.5 x 4 inches and fits the camera easily. For carrying on a shoulder, I use the Leica '18727' case, which is a perfect fit with a very classy appearance.I don't have much to say about camera settings, since they're different in some ways than what I'm used to. Reading the manual is very important, at least to get the settings right. I shoot JPEG (.JPG) only, and I changed the default image quality from normal to 'Fine'. I haven't figured out the ISO settings yet - I'm used to setting 'Auto ISO' for most shooting, but with the Coolpix 'A' in 'P' (Program) mode, I had to select a specific ISO, and I chose ISO 400. This works well for what I do, but it would be better if I could select 'Auto ISO' with a maximum limit of 400 or 800 as some other cameras allow. Maybe what I'm seeing here is Nikon's way of saying that 'Auto ISO' belongs only with 'Auto' dial modes and not P/A/S/M. The Coolpix 'A' is a very high quality and expensive camera, and I recommend against trying to skimp on batteries or memory cards, which are relatively cheap. Always use a genuine Nikon battery, and choose a name brand memory card with a good speed rating, with 16 gb or greater capacity.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome power in the palm of your hand", "Author": "V.

I love the simplicity of the design.  Where I live, dslr's scream pro.  This camera gives me amazing sharp pictures without the attention of a dslr.  I recently went on a family trip to Washington DC.  I set the camera to Aperture Priority mode at f5.6 and shot all day for 5 days.  When I presented my pictures on my 50\" panasonic plasma for the family, everyone was impressed with the clarity and transparency of the pictures.  One of my favorite features of the camera is exposure compensation and watching the effects in live view.  I get perfect exposures no matter how bright or dark it is.  As a side note, I also own a D600 and love it.  However, I have not invested in a wide quality lens for it yet.  I plan too.  Anyways, the pictures I get from my coolpix a blows my current 24-85 vr lens on my d600 out the water.  Lastly, the focus is not blazingly fast.  However, for what I plan to use the coolpix a for, which is mostly travel and street shooting, its very good.  I never felt like I missed a moment because the focus was too slow.

I traveled to the Netherlands in April-May and decided one of my SLRs would just be too heavy. I splurged on the Coolpix A.The camera is unbelievable. Please note, it is a fixed focal length lens, but the optics are fantastic. The many diverse options and controls suit me perfectly. Most are consistent with the higher end SLRs with the addition of some very intelligent and useful ones. There is, for instance a quite serviceable close-up feature.I have to add one unanticipated characterisic. I was in an accident in Amsterdam; hit by a tram. I suffered some broken bones, etc., but am recovering well. The camera was in my vest pocket and received the full impact.

But I was always disappointed overall with the compact cameras since I was always comparing to my DSLRs.  Not saying they weren't well made, decent compacts, but I wanted good noise handling, high ISO capability, good resolution, sharp photos, and something small to carry around when I didn't want to take the DSLR.  The CoolPix A fit that.The best thing was that the Coolpix A has a good APS sensor, but I wasn't sure about having a fixed wide angle lens.  Then I started looking at the images taken with it, the capability of the camera itself, the size, the quality, etc, and that fixed lenses can perform better than its zoom counterpart.  Well, this Coolpix A lens is perfect.  Good sharpness and performance coupled with a camera that produces great colors along with a DSLR sensor that allows me to have the flexibility I wanted.Did I think I'd go for a fixed lens, no.  Am I glad I have it now, yes.  The size and build of the A is great, I take it with me all the time.

The menu system is odd to say the least and having to go into a menu to switch between still and movie mode is a real pain.  Image quality is quite good but the 18mm (28mm equivalent) f2.8 lens is rather limiting.  An f2.0 or 1.8 maximum aperture and the inclusion of VR would have made it more usable in low light.  With no viewfinder built in, you have to hold the camera in front of you to use the rear LCD which is unstable and doesn't allow you to support the camera properly handheld (VR would have helped here too...).  There is an optical viewfinder option but it cost nearly half as much as the camera itself!  The size is OK given the APS-C size sensor but, otherwise, I'm not really a fan of the Coolpix A.

In absolute terms, this is a very good camera that has a solid sensor, wonderful controls and feel and a reasonably okay AF system. So what's wrong with this picture?The fixed lens. I own a D800, D7100, D5100, P7700 and a lot of glass. I use plenty of primes. But the key-word in photography is flexibility; the ability to quickly adapt to the light and shadows to create what you want. While it IS true that a lack of flexibility can actually help to train many a shooter, the more experienced may find this limiting far too often. Looking at the small size and truly astonishing quality of the 28-200mm zoom on the P7700 I shake my head in wonder at the fixed 28mm. Too wide for many types of portraits and not wide enough for various landscape situations, this lens will only appeal to a narrow group in the end. I own the Nikon 28mm 1.8G and it's my least used lens. When I do use it I will often use it wide open for interior work. The A is not as fast, so no big help there. Even a short zoom, say 24-50mm, would have made the A a must-have camera for many. Of course many owners will talk about the purity of prime shooting. Spare me! I was shooting fixed lens rangefinders 30 years ago and I know all about it. Using a prime lens is wonderful. Being STUCK with it is LIMITING. Considering the cost of the A I can't quite swallow this limitation.In all other respects I really liked the A. I know there's a market for it and I understand the appeal. But I generally see no reason for a camera like this anymore than I see a need to build a steam-powered car. It might be interesting and fun at times, but when it comes to photography this is a incredibly overpriced tool. I really don't think many people realize how close the P7700 is in quality and much BETTER it is in adaptability. The Canon S110 provides tiny size and solid IQ when I want something truly small in my pocket.While I enjoyed trying out the A, I just don't see a sensible place for it in my kit.Cheers!The Good Captain", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is Coolpix A the best pocket camera?", "Author": "Alex Hamradio \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R9NXMRVNFU1LK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nikon Coolpix A is really smallest camera with large APS-C sensor.Picture quality is very good, but I hoped that will be close to my D90 with fix lens, but ... it isn't.For:- small size,- light weight,- fast ready-to-shoot time,- transparent picture with natural colors,- incredible clear and bright display (D90's display smokes aside),- \"i\"-button is really hot-key to change anythin on the fly,- good job with smart scenes-mode.Against:- slow autofocus (especially in the night),- no optical stabilization, and as result hard to shoot without camera shake in low-light.Good camera, but these two \"against\" do not live up to expectations at such a high price.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great street photo camera", "Author": "Evaristo Cedillo Salazar \"gcedillo\"", "ReviewID": "R2JWKKEISBCFOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the camera in a national chain electronics store, impressed by being lightweight,  can put it in my shirt pocket, great dynamic range with good light,  get an extra battery if you are trigger happy, I got about 300 plus pics from the battery it went to two bars, not completely depleted.I must say that the iso range is very decent, after the new LR 4.4 appeared, I could get excelent image quality on to iso 3200, from 6400 on is very acceptable, had to edit my opinion given the LR update.I think is a good second camera, or a great street camera.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Camera to Use With Your DSLR Camera or by Itself", "Author": "Leon", "ReviewID": "R2DT7HB7ER3ZXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have Nikon Coolpix A and Nikon D800 cameras.

I use the PASM modes and my girlfriend uses superior auto, before you guys flame me in thinking I did not do the research on the camera before buying I believe you should read everything I said and what I think the rx100 is better served for.Please understand they do not really compete with one another although you can make relatively comparable comparisons.There is no argument at ~$1000 the coolpix A does in fact have a larger image sensor than the ~$600 rx100. Using the Coolpix A what really bugs me is the lack of actual zoom on this thing and the slow autofocus on this thing as well. Lastly there is an annoying thing where there is a little switch on the side to switch to between: macro, auto focus and manual focus. The lack of image stabilization is another bad thing the RX100 lens does have image stabilization.RX100 advantages does have faster auto focus, in superior auto you do not need to physically hit a switch to go in between macro and auto focus. (it does what it suppose to do auto detect that its a macro picture or other scene options) The Macro on the RX100 is also significantly better as well, I prefer the macro on the RX100 as I can get a closer shot to the object before the focus does not work anymore.But do realize in real world situations a faster auto focus, image stabilization will generally snap you a better picture than a camera with slower auto focus especially when you are using auto mode on these two cameras. Where the RX100 shines is the faster auto focus being able to snap multiple pictures at once and choosing the best picture of the bunch it snaps. To me if you want an all around camera the RX100 would be the definite choice but if you are maybe just taking pictures of landscapes or non moving pictures on a tripod the Coolpix A might be a better choice.If you google rx100 vs coolpix a you'll find spec comparisons and reasons why you might wind up loving the RX100 over the coolpix A.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stellar Picture Quality, lacking necessary features in a Coolpix", "Author": "Robert Cozzi", "ReviewID": "R2L5BYZQMQ2YWD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Fantastic photos come out of this camera, however the shortcomings are that unlike virtually all other point-n-shoot cameras, this model has a fixed-focal length lens.
