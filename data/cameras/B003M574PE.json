{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT STANDARD CANON ITEMS BUT POOR QUALITY ACCESSORIES", "Author": "Stephen Spinner", "ReviewID": "R1DT4JWR69KEA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This \"HUGE\" Canon Rebel T2i package has been reviewed elsewhere on Amazon (but with the 16Gig SDHC card vs. this 32GIG SDHC card), and I concurred that the standard accessories are excellent, but the Zeikos accessories added are pure junk!!! Aside from the 10 year warrantee for a rather shoddy looking Zeikos tripod, and the Transcend brand Class 4 32Gig SDHC (good mainly for only stills, not the camera's HD video function, to which I anticipated the need for a Sandisk Class 10 16Gig, and placed an order for this simultaneously from another one of Amazon's third party sellers). As stated elsewhere, the Macro/Wide Angle lense is crap; I needed the unscrewable Macro portion of the lense, which both distorted the image progressively towards the peripheral edges of the field of view, and created a nasty barrel effect. (Thank Heaven's for Photoshop's cropping feature, though I will likely just scrap its use and use the standard Canon zoom optics and avoid what also appeared to be a deteriorated image. I haven't used the Zeikos telephoto lense yet, and probably will net the same neglegible results vs. the Canon optics. I could not find the LCD protective plastic cover in the little camera maintenance pak, and would not chance the use of the ditzy little table tripod. I am informed the 3 supplied filters fall apart soon after use. The 2 additional battery packs are NOT Canon products, and I am informed yields fewer stills per full charge than the Canon OEM product. The Canon 55-255 zoom lense and, I believe, the standard Canon 18-55 zoom lense are both from Taiwan!  SINCE THIS REVIEW, SELLER HAS ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT AND EXPLAINED AWAY MY WRONG ASSUMPTION OF OVERCHARGING FOR THESE ADDITIONAL ITEMS, SO I AM RECOMMENDING THE SELLER WITH 5 STARS, NOW!", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "The camera is perfect....the package is rubbish", "Author": "O.George", "ReviewID": "R31DDF86IWUYF1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Simply the camera is fantastic... but don't buy the package...it is full of rubbish....the macro lens, the 2X lens, the tripod, the flash and the case are all rubbish", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "All lenses are not Japan made", "Author": "Luke Chang", "ReviewID": "R19155HG127DEF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera is made in Japan, a good one, thats about it.  Two lenses are made in Taiwan and Malaysia, all other additional items are made in China.  Lenses not made in Japan have lower quality, all China made stuff are junk, very crapy and usseless.

But they are very poor, some of them useless. The telephoto lens is so blurry that it is not usable. The flash is also unusable.The lens are from taiwan but i was already expecting that and they are worth the price.My most disappointing is that they changed the original Canon battery for a generic one. I know I was buying two generic batts, but I was expecting to get the Canon original that usually came with the camera. But I got 3 generic batts for each kit (Yeah I bought 2 kits, so i got 6 generic batteries).The filters, SD card and other stuff on the pack are all ok and work good as expected.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera Kit", "Author": "Gabriel M Martinez", "ReviewID": "R3JZNC98RGKN63", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought these accessories for my wife and she loves them.

It was in brand new condition as advertised and has all the features plus more that I was looking for. So far, takes great pictures. There is so much to learn, but is better than the 2 Canon Powershot cameras that I own.  The extra lenses, 32gb sdhc card, extra batteries, tripod plus other items purchased with the camera work great.  The only thing I've had to buy extra is a lager camera bag because the one that came with the kit is too small to fit all the extras.
