I picked this guy up and was impressed with since the first time i started playing with it.The image stabilization and facial recognition software is very impressive, and the amount of pre-set light settings makes it super easy to get the best shot.Basically, for the amount of camera you get for the money, and how easy and beautiful the pictures come out, you cannot find a better camera.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not easy to use, poor picture quality", "Author": "Kelly Johnson", "ReviewID": "RZ1PGYFTKP37P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had a kodak easyshare LS743 and loved it.  It was my first digital camera.  It took great pictures, processed quickly, and took amazing videos.  I dropped 100 times and it held up (I have 3 kids).  The only reason I wanted to replace it was because I knew it was time to get more megapixels and upgrade the lcd screen.  I bought this camera thinking it would have the same qualities.  I was wrong.The picture somehow has worse quality with 10.2 megapixel than my 4.0.  The button used to scroll through the menu can barely be pressed on the left side because of the groove of the camera.  The video sound was low and weak.I would not recommend this camera to anyone.  Major disappointment.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very impressed! Easy to use!", "Author": "S. Brunette", "ReviewID": "RTNIJ0J1CW3TC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a first-time digital camera user, I honestly didn't know what to buy, or how much to invest. I knew mega-pixels were a big factor, and most of the high-range megapixels ran on the higher end of the cost spectrum.  I did some research (as well as cost-comparison) and, for the money, the Kodak Easyshare M1073IS is a GREAT buy. I paid $129 for mine - it was a bundle deal where I got the camera, a case, a memory card \"wallet\", cleaning supplies for the screen, a rechargeable battery WITH a wall charger, and a stand to hold the camera. The \"extras\" alone would have ran around another $40-$50 seperately.  I installed the software, registered my product (got 20 free 4x7's to have sent to me from kodakgallery.com also!), and began using it right away. The CD that allowed me to upload and edit the images is super-easy to use, especially for those of us who don't take photos on a regular basis.  I would personally recommend this camera to anyone wanting to get a simple to use and affordable digital camera. In fact, it turns out my best friend has the EXACT same camera, but in silver (mine is red)!!**NOTE** - If you plan on constantly zooming into things from WAY far away, you will probably want to look into buying a camera with a higher optical zoom - be prepared to pay a LOT more for this feature upgrade, however.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak camera review", "Author": "Edward K.

My old camera was only 3 mega pixels. The pictures were always crisp.  This camera is 10 plus mega pixels. In an outside scene, I could not even see the picture I wanted to take. I could only see my reflection in the viewer. There were times, were I was taking the picture blindly, and just hoped it would come out. Also, the pictures looked dark when taking them. The quality of the picture was not bad. I wish it had the eye viewer, like the old fashioned cameras. I would not recommend buying this camera.", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Entry Level Camera....", "Author": "SomeBlerk", "ReviewID": "R3NC2SETC4EG4Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a present and have been using it for about two years now. From the moment I set eyes on it I decided to replace it with something better! The chrome and body finish on it is rubbish - all lumpy and mismatched - the paint looks as if its been applied with a brick! The buttons and controls are cheap looking and feel as if they are about to break at any minute. Although it is fairly easy to use and the picture quality is OK, the lens motors can be heard on any video it takes and bizarrley the charge lights seem to be around the wrong way (green when the battery needs charging and red when it's charged...!)THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS CAMERA THOUGH...is the hyper annoying delay between pressing the shutter button, and the camera actually recording the picture in front of it. Generally when people see/hear the shutter they naturally presume that the picture has been taken and start to walk off, or relax. I am constantly taking pictures of the side and back of people's heads or even empty pictures where the plane/bird/car/train etc WAS.... The actual picture seems to be recorded a few seconds after the shutter has opened. It then takes about 10 seconds to sort its life out again before deciding to take another picture - by which time the UFO or whatever has left.......The battery seems to take a full over night charge in order to be any where near good and then gives up after a short amount of time, in fact I think I would be better off employing an artist to follow me around and paint pictures for me - probably be quicker...", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic point and shoot", "Author": "slugduck \"slugduck\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZS0FIU6F26YM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my wife who is not good with gagetry, but she wanted to start taking pictures.  It has been a fantastic camera for her.  It is not complicated.  It seems to take great pictures on any setting.  And best of all my wife uses it all the time.  It's so compact she just carries it in her purse where ever she goes.  I've taken pictures with it too and it is just first rate.  We liked it so much we bought a second just to have so when this one finally falls apart we have a back up.  The software is easy to use too.  It pretty much downloads your pics without you doing much of anything except plugging in the cord to your computer.", "Date": "September 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Point And Shoot", "Author": "C. Torres", "ReviewID": "R1G7Q2MWUQFCUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have two of these cameras, one for use while on the jobsite and one for personal use.  The best feature for me is the rechargeable battery.  Having to fumble around looking for new batteries has always been a hassle for me.  With this camera, I just plug it in at the end of the day, and its ready to go in the morning.  The picture quality is great and the Kodak Easy Share software is a breeze to use when you want to store images on your computer.  Overall I think this is a fantastic basic camera with some very useful features that anyone can use.  The size is perfect for travel and in your shirt pocket at work.

It's easy to use, but, like any good toy, challenging enough to keep your interest as you learn all of the features. (I usually find the best deals at Amazon, but found this at another on-line store for $100, and that included a 2 GB memory card.)  Basically everything you need to know can be found on the LCD Screen.  Each time you change settings, it tells you what the current setting is for, so you're not constantly referring to the user guide.  It even has a \"Help\" feature.  The pictures are great; I haven't had any problems getting great pics in the dark; putting the camera in Scene (SCN) mode gives you a wide variety of lighting options.  Video is great and easily uploads to my computer via the USB cable and Easy Share software.  I have taken several minutes of video but am still unsure of how much video you can take with a 2 GB card.  I love being able to create still shots from whatever video frames I want.  Also love being able to \"stitch\" three shots together into one panoramic picture.  Besides the optional date stamp, you can add text and audio tags to your pictures, tag pictures as favorites, lock them so they aren't accidentally deleted, and add e-mail addresses to share photos when uploaded.  The basic features (zoom, b/w,sepia, etc) work great also. Packaging included a clear plastic base, which works as a great stand for charging the camera and is also a makeshift tripod for capturing video. Kodak recently upgraded their Easy Share software to v7.1 which includes a scrapbooking feature.  Free download is available from their website.  You can do some editing right on the camera, but the software allows more editing features.  As for size, I carry a very small purse and this camera fits nicely into one of the pockets- I don't leave home without it.  The one downside is that the camera does not have a viewfinder and it can be difficult to see the LCD screen in bright sunlight.  I will continue to work on that, but in the meantime- I just do my best to get the image I want and edit it later.  All in all, I would highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "awesome indoor camera", "Author": "Lee Alsing", "ReviewID": "R2R8CZZNK72L8Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To be fair - this camera is awesome and packed with features - it does everything and the menu's are so easy even i figured most of them out.  I bought this to use when my bigger camera wasn't convenient to haul along.  I just got back from my first outing with the Kodak Easy Share and was glad it wasn't the only camera i took along on our ocean visit.  This camera was useless out in the sun!  the viewfinder was black and no discernable images were viewable - i just pointed and clicked and the photos, while excellent in quality and sharpness, were not framed well and there were many instances where i would have used the great zoom feature had i been able to see what i was pointing at.  This is not recommended as an only camera - i'll just keep it handy in the house for those grandkid and cute pet moments.", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easy Share", "Author": "K. L.

I've only had it about 7 months and am already considering tossing it in the trash. The pictures, even when taken in the higher megapixels, come out really blurry and the coloring is drab. It takes semi-decent movies, but when you try to zoom in, it makes a clicking noise which is heard when you re-play the movie.
