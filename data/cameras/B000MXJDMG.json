Otto \"Laser Brain\"", "ReviewID": "R2WMW6WU705VSS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATEThere are some newer cameras out there that use bigger lenses, unbelievable processing techniques, and lenslet arrays in front of the sensor to get more light on those pixels. The upshot is, that if you want a camera that just takes the best picture possible indoors in a pocket point and shoot, you will be very happy for example with a Sony Cybershot DSC-WX1, but you'll have to shell out $329.  Nevertheless, in 2010, it makes this Casio look like about the least expensive camera around.OVERVIEWUp until the past year, if you wanted a better picture in low-light conditions, you needed a bigger sensor and a bigger lens. That typically meant a digital SLR. This past year, Nikon, Sony and Canon have shown that several short duration pictures can be taken, and stitched together to effectively increase the exposure time without the blur from handheld jitter. If you have $350 to spend, consider the Sony Cybershot DSC-WX1 or TX1.But this Casio is an average to low-end compact camera, and has some nice features and takes good pictures. But like any compact camera designed in 2007, more than 2-3 megapixels clearly resolved is not really possible except in the brightest sunlit conditions. If you look closely, they are going to be grainy and blurry. Some compact cameras are better than others at disguising the grain and blur with aggressive processing to punch up the colors and contrast and sharpness. But if you look really close, you'll see that it is really not much better than 3 megapixels. However, in 2010, the new DSC-TX7 challenges that assumption. See test photos compared to the Exilim Z75 here:[...]Beyond that, this camera does nice snapshots, especially if the light is good. Videos are very nice and high quality, but not HD. Once you figure out the menus and modes, this camera is great if you are looking for a small camera and that's more important than professional quality photos.The LCD viewscreen does not show sharp images, and it's annoying, but it does not affect picture quality.If you want to take a lot of pictures under low light conditions (indoors), get used to the idea of a bigger camera than this, or the above mentioned Cybershot. Or settle on fewer pixels.You should know that the \"anti shake\" mode of this is simply a mode that pushes the effective ISO up. That means that it takes an underexposed picture and processes it to be brighter. Of course, it's going to be grainy and noisy. Most other compact cameras in this price range do this same trick. (But the somewhat larger Canon A570IS has true optical anti-shake.)A lot of people have had problems with getting a camera with a dead battery. If these lithium batteries sit around too long, they discharge too far to recover. Call Casio service immediately and tell them you got a new camera with a dead battery. There is a good chance they will replace it. My battery failed after about one year or so.DETAILED REVIEWI got the Exilim Z75 from Amazon, and it arrived in about a week.The battery charged right up (about 90 minutes) and the camera worked as soon as I loaded the battery and a memory card. I guess I was lucky to get a good battery.After using the camera for a several months and uploading pictures and movies, I think it is a great little camera. In bright light it rivals the pictures from my Fujifilm 7000, a much larger point and shoot. But with backlit scenes, the lens has more flare, and the images are more grainy.If you think you need to take indoor pictures in full 7 megapixel resolution and they should come out crystal clear and sharp when blown up to 100% (zoomed way in on your computer,) you need to read the next 4 numbered paragraphs. Otherwise, skip all the technical explanation and go to \"WHAT CASIO COULD HAVE DONE BETTER.\"Please note that I am an electro-optical physicist and I know the limitations that some buyers may not be prepared for. Let me state some of those:1. To put 7.2 million pixels into such a tiny space means the pixels will be very small and the smaller they are, the less light they will receive especially indoors. Since the sensor is pretty much limited by photon statistics, (meaning the noise of the photon arrival itself is the limit, not the camera) the graininess in the picture is not something that is really the camera's fault. If you want 7.2 million pixels in a tiny camera, please be aware that it is not going to perform better than a 3 million pixel tiny camera except in very bright sunlight. You might also want to be aware that the tiny pixels tend to scatter some light to adjacent pixels, further reducing the sharpness of the picture. Also note that for this tiny lens, 5 megapixels is very close the the diffraction limit - the laws of physics say you need a bigger lens to do any better. Or, you need to put lenslets in front of each pixel to gather more light.2. With such a small sensor, the lens needs to be very short focal length. This means that it is not really very practical to make a lens that is going to be much larger diameter. In most cases the lens is limited to a diameter about half the focal length or less.3. If you really want 7.2 million meaningful pixels, you are going to need a sensor at least 4 times as large, with a lens about four times the area and twice the length. However, there are new techniques introduced in 2009 that partially address this problem. If this is important to you, consider a newer camera.4. 7.2 million pixels is more than you could get from any 35mm film SLR without noticeable fuzziness and graininess. Even low speed, fine grain film. I know, I have tens of thousands of negatives in 35 mm format, taken with a very decent f/1.4 lens.  WHAT CASIO COULD HAVE DONE BETTER1. The LCD viewer does not display a sharpened image. This gives the impression of a blurry picture, but it is actually not. If you blow it up, it is reasonably detailed and sharp.2. The movie and sound recording modes are accessed through \"Best Shot.\" This is counter-intuitive, but once you learn where it is, it is no problem.3. The flash is weak (but similar to other small cameras), forcing the camera to take a noisier (grainier) photo in flash mode than would otherwise be necessary. The trade off to get a brighter flash would have been greatly reduced battery life, and most people do not like that. However, newer cameras make up for this with better sensors and processing.4. The battery is a little harder to handle than it needs to be  and there is no mechanical interlock to make sure it can't be inserted the wrong way. So you have to watch carefully what you are doing every time you handle the battery. (But be aware that to have a slim camera, you need a slim battery.)6. It is not as thin as other (\"S\" series) Exilim cameras.7. There is no light for aiding the focus function as in the Canon Elph.8. There is no Panorama stitching function.9. Like most cameras, it does not come with a case.10. The included 8 MB of memory is slow.11. The battery charger has a long cable. The Canon charger has no cable at all and is easy to carry.12. That big LCD on the back has a glass window over it. But there is no way to replace the glass if you scratch it up.13. The USB connector doubles as an audio-visual connector. I have never used the audio-visual output on ANY camera myself. But the drawback is that the USB connector is not standard, so you will need to make sure you do not lose the cable.14. The lens is so-so. There is not bad barrel or pincushion distortion, but there is some purple fringing near the edges of the frame if you blow the image up enough, you'll see it. This is seen on high contrast objects like small back-lit tree branches against a bright sky. The most common failure mode of these cameras is that the lens fails to open or retract properly. It is operated by a tiny little motor with tiny plastic gears and cams, but should it ever accidentally get turned on so the lens can not open all the way, kiss the camera goodbye.  WHAT I LIKE1. I can easily turn the flash off or set it to soft. This saves battery life and lets me be less noticeable when taking pictures.2. I can turn the camera on in play mode without having the lens cycle. Simply press the play button to turn it on.3. It can record sound for each picture.4. The movie quality is great, and playback on the LCD is very good.5. After some initial reluctance, I was brought over to the \"Best Shot\" approach.6. The lens has a nice little built-in cap so the lens is protected when not in use.7. The case is all solid metal and feels rock solid.8. The pictures are easily uploaded to a Windows OS without any proprietary software. The camera looks like a memory-drive to the computer.9. There is a tripod threaded mount hole.10. The flash charges pretty quickly (that's because it doesn't have much power, of course.)11. You can usually get a decent picture even if you skip the \"Best Shot\"12. In bright sunlight, the pictures are gorgeous. If you manually set it to ISO 50 for this, the shots can not be beat in a compact camera.  SUMMARYIt's a great inexpensive camera to have handy. It's not going to replace my FinePix S7000, and if I had a Cybershot, I would get rid of the Exilim, but it's well worth having around. It takes good pictures as long as you don't try to take them in too much darkness. Maybe for some people it would have been better to for Casio to program the camera to just blink \"NOT ENOUGH LIGHT\" when the conditions are too dark. That way it would be harder to take a bad picture. But I don't like the camera to tell me I can't take a picture, so I am willing to live with some pictures that are too fuzzy. It's better than no picture at all sometimes. So it's a good camera for the money, but it isn't going to be giving a digital SLR any competition.Alternatives: If you really like the thin cameras, go for the Exilim \"S\" series. If you would like a sharper LCD screen, seriously consider the Canon Elph series.  If you can accept a slightly larger camera, consider the Canon Powershot A570IS. It is in the same price range and even has optical anti-shake, and the pixels are somewhat less grainy and a little more sharp. And it uses AA batteries. If you have $300 go for the Sony DSC-WX1, or DSC-TX1", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "A nice entry-level point-and-shoot", "Author": "Andrew Bolte", "ReviewID": "R1LEE0CHOKSQY4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this product after hearing from my parents that there was a Casio Exilim available for $230...considerably less than what I'd seen a year ago when I was looking for a camera. It was $205 here, so I jumped at the chance, and after taking several shots with it over 2 weeks, I can tell that it's good for what it is - an entry-level point-and-shoot camera - but it's not without its faults.There are many different \"ideal\" modes that you can choose from to get a slightly higher-quality shot, depending on the situation (indoor, outdoot, sport, and many others...even an \"eBay Best Shot\" mode)...but once you get a chance to work with the camera, it becomes obvious that it doesn't do action shots very well at all. Perhaps this would be alleviated if you used a tripod, but most of the action shots I've tried have turned out quite blurry.Still shots, however, do look quite presentable. There is a fair amount of grain and noise in the picture in certain situations (low lighting, for example), but this appears to be another case of \"You get what you pay for.\"All in all, it's a highly portable camera, great for getting spontaneous shots wherever you go...but don't expect miracles from the EX-Z75. From what I've read, there are better options for the price, and better options within the Exilim line, including models that allow for manual image control and high-speed shooting, so you may want to do some research before purchasing this particular camera.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Does what it is suppose to....

I thought it was cute how they added a \"slide-show\" option where you can view your photos in slide-show mode (I've never seen this on a camera). You can choose from different types of flashes (like most cameras). There are white balance options as well (again, like most cameras). There's a self-timer and anti-shake (which I haven't used yet). Another plus is the size of the screen: it's so wide and you can see how clear and crisp the pictures come out. The quality of the video suprised me as well. However with my expierence when I play it back on the computer the audio skips, I have no idea why. The instruction booklet doesn't help much with anything, it just comes with the basics of the camera.

The batteryis small, and inexpensive. Several of these can fit in the palmof your hand, on an international holiday trip, ready for the proper timeto use. If one battery goes bad, you can buy more online or swap fromthe spare. Also, the battery recharger takes 90 minutes to charge eachsuper-long lasting lithium ion battery, only, which is pretty fast.Secondly, the small size, means it's a plus to carry around at all times,during sight seeing, without causing a hassle, and is easily concealed.Third, in ideal situations (meaning, tripod-mounted, or no zoom usedand ample time to take pictures) the pictures are excellent and satisfying.Some other pluses, are the extremely impressive value for the pricepaid on this camera, and also the powerful flash for night pictures onthe Casio and the many megapixels offered on this model.On the downside, it seems digital cameras simple cannot match the oldones based on negatives and rolls of film, in terms of taking spontanouspictures, in focus almost every time.Next, the colors are not specifically notable in the Casio, unlike aSony digital camera I've used, which truely are spectacular on the latter.As well, the \"best shot\" or \"pre-determined\" settings for varioussituations takes getting used to, and doesn't delieve as much as one mightthink, or was promised. In fact, any amount of zoom used, even whenwalking and taking pictures at the same time,will result in blur. Also,some pre-set situations are very similar to others, such as for low light.The Ebay function is not as incredible as one might think ...the SONYcamera I have (a big battery burner) takes close-ups a lot better thanthis Casio.Finally, in my box, there was no plastic camera case, which I had tobuy from Ebay for $10.Overall, the Casio Exilim EX-Z75 is somewhat ideal for those wantingto carry 24/7, all over their travels, in case they want to recorda sight or a situation or a person or a meeting for posterity, thatotherwise would be lost.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good looks, poor product", "Author": "C.

We couldn't even turn it on because of the error. We searched through tons of internet forums for some self-help on correcting the lens error, but there was none (at least, nothing worth trying - we weren't about to put it in a closed plastic bag with a kerosene-soaked cloth).

All the rest of the brands got grouped into a 2-nd tier category. This is NOT TRUE any longer! The Casio (and all of the reviews of it elsewhere) prove that advances in DSP technology, common optical elements across brands, and the incorporation of very high quality (even name brand in many cases) lens glass has allowed a multitude of companies to create GREAT cameras, including Panasonic, Casio, etc.Frankly, the main difference between ANY digital cameras these days (within a price range) is the quality of the menu/navigation, the inclusion of various features, the quality of the DSP/image processing and any accessories included in the package. It is really NOT about Megapixels which is ironically what most people focus on.  Nearly every brand has whatever megapixels you are looking for, so read on...The Casio Z75 is nice. It has great light sensitivity, a high quality optical zoom element, and abounds with features. The ability to navigate to features and settings seems to be intuitive to me, but that is really a personal view that each user will have to make for themselves. One of the MOST SIGNIFICANT features is what they call \"BEST SHOT\". In essence, it's the one-touch ability to set multiple camera settings at a time based on real-world conditions (i.e. Indoor Birthday party, NASCAR racing, etc). This BEST SHOT feature may be the most useful feature on ANY digital camera since using a pocket digital is a function of how fast and easy you can get the 'money shot'.  Best Shot is significant towards that end. If I need to capture a portrait of someone standing in a shadow, followed by a dog chasing a little kid, the camera settings vary greatly. BEST SHOT allows this FAST migration in settings to allow those shot types to be set quickly.The Z75 is clean lines, thin, lightweight and long battery life (approx 200 shots).

I had a Casio Exilim Z40, which I loved and used for 4 years before it finally met its doom against a rock face, and had high expectations for this camera. The results were very disappointing. The Z75 makes it hard for you to change flash settings and the flash options, unlike the Z40 and some of the other older models. You have to actually scroll down through the side small menu or enter into the settings to alter the type. Most of the functions requires you having to fiddle around in the menu selection, so if you're chasing down a bird or some other wildlife, this is not the camera for you. However, if you are taking pictures at a family gathering and everyone's willing to sit still for half a minute, that's fine.Also, the Anti Shake does not seem to do much. The picture comes out slightly blurry if its anything other than bright sunlight outside whether you have turned on Anti-shake or not. You either need a tripod or a really steady hand to avoid the blur. But even with a tripod, pictures come out slightly grainy if its taken in anything other than bright light. It appears that the lens is too small and requires very bright light in order for it to take decent pictures. But other the same conditions, most other point and shoots perform just fine without the grainy-ness. The camera's flash capability is also sadly useless.

I have photographed myriad things, from classic vacation shots to the absurd, but reviewing my most recent offerings from a trip to Vancouver, BC really reminded me how great a deal this camera is.  At one point, while riding thru Stanley Park on rented bikes, I got the wild hair to use my gorillapod to strap the thing to the front of my bike. I took a couple of videos from this position (complete with sound) and a TON of pictures - all while the bike was in motion.  Most of the pictures are crisp and fantastic, in spite of the shaking and bumps and general madness of me taking photos from the back of a mountain bike.So - get thee this camera (look at the price!  it's $40 cheaper than when I bought it!) and get thee a gorillapod --- let your creative juices flow!

The quality is pure crisp, and very easy to operate.  Even Casio knows this for sure, as the user manual barely covers the basics of what button to press to take pictures, inserting batteries and SD cards, and not much more.  But, it's not necessary, and the functions are easy to figure out.The body is somewhat slick, and I fear I will drop this too easily.  The lanyard could be a bit longer, providing a tad more slack.  Also, the screen is slightly fuzzy, so taking multiple pictures is suggested until you get the feel of what is \"normal\" and will produce a crisp picture.

So I did some research online, I wanted a camera with good battery life, good picture quality, using a standard SD card and would easily fit in a pocket. I wanted all of that in a package that cost as little as possible, so if it didn't survive the deployment I wouldn't feel all that bad about it. And that is exactly what I got in the Exilim and I couldn't be more pleased.Being around the size of a deck of cards I am thrilled with how easy this camera is to carry around. The pictures it takes are very high quality and not being a true photographer but the king of the snap shot, it works for me. The only possible complaint would be the LCD you view your photos on is not the greatest quality. It works but it is hard to tell if your pictures came out well until you get them on the computer. I ended up with the blue one, which is rather light blue and a bit girly, but its not something I could complain about considering the price I paid for it, which was right around the hundred dollar mark. All in all I am well pleased with this camera, and while I bought it for one deployment due to its quality I am sure it will survive the next couple of years without a problem.(Update March, 2010) I just wanted to add that while I bought this camera for one deployment it is on its third and still working fine. I've have started learning photography and upgraded to a DSLR for more serious work. But this camera is so small and easy to carry everywhere that it tags along more often than not. I did have to replace the stock battery after the year marks or so, as it had stop holding a charge.

I think most cameras are getting better at this, but that was always my biggest complaint about digital cameras.This camera comes with a battery and charger, not double AA compatable. That would annoy me, but she doesn't mind. The charger isn't like a Nintendo DS charger, it is much bigger and you have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it. So If your battery goes dead in the middle of the party you aren't just going to pop in some AA's. You have no camera. So plan ahead.The second thing that bugs me about this camera is that the screen is alway exposed. So purchase a small slip case for this camera to help protect the screen.The third thing I do not care for in this camera and the sony cyber shot offers is an eye peice you can look into, if it is too sunny to see the screen. I had this camera outside and I couldn't see anything in the screen due to the sunny day. that would drive me crazy. I had to guess at the direction to point the camera.My daughter didn't seem to care. And on the positive side it is digital so if the pictures don't turn out. You don't have to pay for them or waste film.I am sure my daugter's plan with this camera is lots of pics of her friends. so it is going to do what she wants it to do.I personally would never purchase this camera. I had a sony cyber shot several years ago that I liked, but didn't take great pictures under certain lighting indoors. Cybershots are made better these days and you can use AA. I know have a canon powershot this is in a whole diferent price range from this camera, but is fantastic. And has a 10X zoom lens instead of the 3X zoom.But the casio exilim does take nice pictures. ANd is a good little camera for the 150 bucks plus the cost of an SD memory card(10 to 30bucks) and a small case(10bucks). 25 bucks or so for an extra battery that needs to be specific for the camera.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Almost 5 years later and it still works good", "Author": "lefty", "ReviewID": "R2JPQNKSC3FBEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purcahsed this camera in Jan / 2007 and I have gotten my moneys worth.

I bought it from Wal-Mart for ~ $120 in 2008. Within the first six months, the battery was totally dead so I found a 3rd party supplier for the NP-20 and spent an additional $20 for a new battery. Since that time, the camera has worked alright, but the quality of the picture is marginal at best. This camera's strength is it's compact size, but today, Casio's Exilim Z75 has a LOT of competition with much superior quality. In 2008, this camera was an average value, but by 2009, it was hopelessly outclassed.Now, if you still have this camera and want to take some decent photographs, use the following rule of thumb:Outside in sunlight:1. 5 megapixel setting2. ISO 50Inside with interior lighting or outside with minimal sunlight:1. 3 megapixel setting2. ISO 100Forget the 7 megapixel setting as it exceeds the diffraction limit of the lens and forget ISO 400 and even ISO 200.

(the EX-750 model)+ very easy/small to carry+ easy to operate+ large LCD screen+ great pictures+ LONG battery / charge lifeThe LCD screen is much larger than the average camera has which makes it easy to view and plan your shots. It's also much easier to view them on the camera right away to see if you should delete and re-shoot. I also really like having the option of an optical viewer in case I am taking photos outside in the sun.Even though this camera is very compact, it feels much more substantial than the slightly larger Canon I bought for my son.Our camera (EX-750) has a movie option which works out well when taking pics of kids. Sometimes you don't have time to get out the camcorder.One added bonus that I absolutely LOVE is the battery life. This camera lasts forever on a charge. I now take it for granted until I am with someone that missed a shot because their camera is out of juice. I just don't have to worry whether or not the camera is ready to go.Do NOT overlook this feature!It has a different setup than other digitals I have looked at. The camera sits in a very small 'docking' station. From there you can charge the camera, hookup the USB to transfer photos/movies to your computer, or plug in cables so everyone can easily look at the photos on your TV. We use this when we get together for family events. Everyone gets to see the fun from day right away.I have thrown this camera in a small soft case in my purse, taken it to the beach, (I'm not always respectful with my equipment) and I have never had a problem with it.I set the default picture setting to the best quality so I can crop afterwards to a smaller size if I want. (You'll need a larger memory card than the one it comes with) With the quality of photos I have been able to blow up photos to 20-24 and they came out great.The timer function has allowed me to actually be in a few photos instead of always behind the camera.Another +plus is that it takes good photos in relatively low light.I would definitely put this camera on the list.

GOOD STUFF: It worked awesomely through the whole trip, rain, temps over 110, being tossed in a saddlebag accidentally for about 100 miles with no case. I am in the military and deciding not to take the expensive camera to the desert with me, i took this one, carried it in my flight suit pocket for months! sweaty, banged up, and dropped many times, it still never missed a click. Took it on a second stugis trip where it spent the whole trip in and out of my vest pocket, with my keys and a zippo, flawless, my wife took it with her on her last deployment to Iraq, sandstorms, and multiple moves packed in a seabag still works great.  It is now in the hands of my 15 yr old daughter who has washed or broken 3 ipods and 2 phones and still going strong.BAD STUFF: the battery did die on me after i left it uncharged for an extended period of time (bout a month) but casio was right on it and i had a new one 4 days after i called them.  also I did for a short period of time have a \"lens error\" where the lens wouldnt pop out,  I removed the battery and let it sit for about 2 days, then still had the error, tried to cycle the lens in and out many times and all of a sudden I guess it fixed itself and i havnt had that problem since.

Then, the camera would never turn on.  Came to find out the battery was bad, Casio sent us a new battery, no questions asked, no cost.  So, the camera's up and running now, but the battery still dies extremely fast, even after it's first trickle charge.  The maximum time you can set the camera to shut off after is only 5 minutes, which makes it a struggle when you're attempting to upload photos using an Eye-Fi Card.Another big thing that I noticed is its focus.

When I took a few test pictures I noticed the images usually came out a bit blurry.  I turned on the anti-shake and did not notice a bit of difference.There are some interesting \"Best Shot\" settings and I haven't experimented with all of them yet, it's possible that there is a setting that will make the pictures come out better.Also I thought the size of the camera would be a positive since I could just slip it in my pocket and go.  Turns out it's a bit hard to use since it is so small. I find that because the battery cover is placed at the bottom right of the camera, just about where your thumb goes (since the shutter button is at the top right) I keep sliding the cover open.  The battery and memory card haven't fallen out yet but it's still very annoying to have to keep closing the battery cover.If small and light are what's important to you, this is a decent camera, if you're looking for good picture quality you may want to try something else.", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "S.

I haven't printed any pictures yet but I did view them (and a video of my dog) on the TV.  They look great.

I took out my Sony (H-1) and that LCD view is much clearer, colors more vivid, and crisper.  Even my son said it was fuzzy.  So I can't really trust what I see.

I upgraded to this camera from a Canon 3MP camera and, even though that was also a great camera for what it was, this one takes much better pictures.  I've made sure to only use the optical zoom and not the digital zoom but it was easy since since the gauge tells you exactly when you're crossing over to digital zoom.The size is great, as well.  Very small and light-weight.  I keep it in my purse (in a little hard-sided case to protect the LCD screen) and it doesn't add much weight.It's pretty easy to use but the one complaint I have with it is that it didn't come with an actual user's manual.  Just a little \"getting started\" manual.  The user's manual came on the installation disc and I have to look on my computer every time I have a question (not much help when I'm in the field).  That could be due to the supplier I bought it from, though.  My boyfriend has a Casio Z60 and his came with a real user's manual.I do wish it was easier to get a good shot of my pets since none of them like to sit still.  I tried using the Best Shot \"pets\" option but it didn't work.  The camera probably just isn't designed for that type of thing.  Or maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.

My wife and I own two of these cameras.  Unfortunately, we were unable to take either of them on our honeymoon last week due to defective batteries.When we got the cameras on Christmas 2007, everything was great.  My battery died in Feb 2008.  Instead of a constant red light, the charger gave a flashing red \"error state\" light.  Casio quickly sent a new battery and acknowledged on the phone that the batteries for the EX-Z75 around last fall had problems.  An internet search about EX-Z75 will confirm this (do your homework!).  In July 2008, both my new battery and my wife's battery both died and gave the flashing-red error indicator on the charger.  THREE dead batteries in 7 months.  Casio sent two more batteries via 2-day mail with no questions asked -- though we had to borrow my dad's camera for the honeymoon.When it's working, the pics are pretty good.  7 MP mode gives slightly blurry images at full resolution, though everything's sharp at 5 MP.  And 5 MP for a camera of this size is admirable.  The flash is a little weak and may give some noise/speckling in the images in dark areas, though outdoor and well-lit images are superb.  And the macro mode is amazing, as I mentioned.  If only longer focal-length images were so sharp at 7 MP...Overall a good buy if you can find it on sale for ~$100 and consider it a 5 MP camera instead of 7 MP... though you'll want to call Casio right away and get an extra battery!", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "sleek looking but grainy picture", "Author": "M.

I now know that this is one I can't live with.Two months after getting the camera, one day it just didn't turn on. It hadn't been dropped, wet, squashed, anything. Just nothing. So we sent it in to Casio for repairs. It was still under warranty and came back amazingly quickly working again. Great. Thought it was a fluke.So one day I dropped it as should be expected with this particular camera. When dropped, this camera lands right on the extended lens. But doen't land perfectly and pushes in one side of the lens making it catawompus and unable to retract. After gently working on it I was able to realign the lens and the camera worked again fine. Two more drops, same thing, irritating but fixable. Now again, all of a sudden it's stopped working again out of the blue. I don't know if it's the dropping or the original problem. It's still under warranty and I'll send it in for repairs again, but the fact of the matter is when I pick up the camera I don't know if it's going to work or not.
