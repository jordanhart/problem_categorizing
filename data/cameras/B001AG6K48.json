Good general purpose day/night security camera.2.  Sufficiently rugged for outdoors.3.  Wide angle lense for area viewing.4.  Good quality image, but not really large.5.  What I found the BEST was the Quality vs Cost ratio.  I have spent much more on a camera in the past that is every bit an equal to this one and it didn't come with the 100 ft of cable (that was extra).  This was the best quality for the price.6.  Your not going to see a license plate at 100 feet, but your going to get a good feel for what's going on in a general area.7.  I purchased this camera (actually more than one) from a company that made sure everything in the order was \"Right\".RegardsSteve H.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001AG6K48"}}
