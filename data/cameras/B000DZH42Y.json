{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb camera with excellent 3 inch screen", "Author": "BJ Ford. \"Max\"", "ReviewID": "R2SQVYLHOAJMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thank you warehouse123 for the incredibly fast and low cost shipping! I'm more than happy to be the owner of a brand new Sony DSC-T50. As a long time user of Sony cameras, owning the T1 before, I would love to have a compact camera with the latest features, including image stabilization as a priority. So I bought the T50 and it is a classy compact camera with great design. I have had this camera around 2 weeks now. I am really pleased with the features and picture quality provided. Battery seems to last forever. 3 inch screen gives excellent display even in bright conditions. Camera shake system works really well...not had any blurred pictures as yet. Like so many other point-and-shoot compact DC, images are subject to digital noise. However, with its optical image stabilization, 3-inch touch screen LCD, sleek design and overall performance, the DSC-T50 is highly recommended.", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Remarkable Camera", "Author": "R. W. Patton", "ReviewID": "R2ESFIQIXWN4U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm rating this camera in comparison to other cameras of similar size that I've used or owned in the past. I also have some pretty sophisticated digital SLR gear, so I am spoiled in respect to image quality.For what it's designed to do, this camera is remarkable. First, it's got a wonderful large viewing screen.Second, instead of toggles and buttons, the T50 uses a touch screen, and that's a HUGE improvement in user-friendliness. It also includes a drawing feature so that you can write your own notes or graphics. This is really helpful if you want to write a quick note describing something about the image.If you draw or write on an image, the image with the graphics is saved as a new image, so you don't have to worry about destroying the original image by writing on it. I'm posting sample images.Image quality is OK - not excellent - but then, if pure image quality is what you want you shouldn't be buying a point-and-shoot in the first place. Image stabilization works very well and really enhances versatility.The camera is small, quiet, and unobtrusive. You can take acceptable photos in surprisingly low light while handholding the camera with the flash turned off.The editing software that's enclosed lets you crop the image and make limited adjustments to brightness, saturation, and color balance. (Again, I'm spoiled here because I use Photoshop CS2 with some of my digital photography. Sony's \"Picture Motion Browser\" software is not anywhere close to that, but it's functional.)The camera would be great for keeping in a pocket, purse, or briefcase. But like many very sophisticated devices it's sensitive. There are some caveats: the instruction manual specifies that the camera is not waterproof, splashproof, or dustproof. Also, condensation due to bringing the camera from a cold place to a warm place can cause malfunctions, and it's recommended only for use between 32F and 104F. So it's probably not the right camera for you if you plan to expose it to moisture or cold.Four stars because though it's technologically impressive, Sony may be overhyping the megapixel count. Don't think that because it has a 7.2 megapixel sensor you're going to want to enlarge your photos beyond about 4x6 inches.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Solid, small digital shines outdoors... stumbles a bit inside.", "Author": "B. Rogers", "ReviewID": "R34PNAGREL4WQK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before heading out to Hawaii for my Wedding and Honeymoon in December, I decided my old Sony DSC-85 was simply too much of a pain to carry around. The pics were and are amazing, but it's just too big to put in a pocket or really take anywhere on the go.So, I started looking for a compact digital camera that had great picture quality, was well-built, and most importantly - had great battery life.After looking around - I narrowed my choices down to the T30, the T50, the N2 (all Sony) and the SD800IS and SD700IS Cannons. In terms of picture quality, I like how SONY images look, but I have to admit the Cannon's were equal to or better than the SONY on most shots... a tad worse on bright outdoor shots, but definitely a bit better on indoor shots. Two things killed the Cannon for me... the build quality and the battery life. The Sony's simply felt more solid and had almost 2X the battery life of the Cannons. I also loved the InfoLithium technology in SONY that shows you how much battery is left in terms of minutes.So, it was down to the Sony's. Once I held the T30 in a store, that was out... where I naturally place my thumb while holding the camera directly pressed on the options buttons... I knew I'd be constantly activating menus and stuff by accident. I'll admit I was skeptical though of the large touch screens on both the N2 and the T50... but once I used it - wow... so much easier. So it came down to 10MP on the N2 and 7MP on the T50... but SteadyShot on the T50 and not on the N2.Ultimately, I was intrigued by SteadyShot and knew I wouldn't need 10MP, so I went with the T50. I also later really appreciated the lack of moving lens parts external to the camera. Slide the front down... CLICK... CLICK... slide it back up. It's that quick. I LOVED that on vacation.So... how's it performing though? Outdoor shots are bright and SONY-crisp. Anywhere with bright natural light (even indoors next to windows) the pictures were stellar. I have to admit, indoors they are only average. They are definitely brighter and clearer than many cameras I've seen and the flash works VERY well... but it definitely has MAJOR red-eye issues. Worse than other cameras I've seen. They say that all ultra-compacts suffer from this... but definitely EXPECT red-eye in your indoor shots directly at people. I knew that going in though from a little research and I knew 90% of the pictures I take are outdoors... so I'm still very happy. The battery life? Wow! Really, really good.The T50 is a very solid, ultra-compact that I really enjoyed using on my honeymoon. It takes great outdoor shots, is light, and has worked flawlessly. It also has the enormous 3\" screen which is great when you want to review pics before dumping them off onto your computer. If you know you'll be doing indoor shots more though - definitely look at the Cannons and the Fuji F31. If you know you need something stylish, very portable, well-built and to take mostly outdoor shots in sunny locales... this camera will be hard to beat.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome Point&Shoot;!", "Author": "SonnySD", "ReviewID": "R2VIBTTO0J1LGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera replaced my Canon sd800. Canon had the worst video sound ever. It could not handle high volume sounds from concerts. It was very dissapointing. And the indoor shots produced too much noise.So now T50 arrives. What a beauty, both from outside and inside.takes very sharp pictures under most light conditions. Supersteady shot seems to be working better that Canon. High Iso mode has less noise than Canon SD800. The videos have perfect sound quality.The touch screen is so easy to use and classy.The battery life is outstanding together with the battery remaining indicator. Canons do not have this indicator for some reason.I would recommend this camera strongly to any P&S; fanatics. get the black one by the way ;)", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "*Almighty One*", "ReviewID": "R1PTTX839HOXOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera through Amazon which had the best price and had no problem with it.

Once I started taking pictures, my resentment started growing - pictures are not crisp (a 3.0 MP camera would do better), flash is poor, spots appear in the picture (thought it was some dirt on the lens but no, that wasn't it).Overall, if you want stylish and cool (looking) camera, go for it. If you want good pictures, stay away from it.Note: The picture may look crisp and clear when you view them on the LCD but when you download them onto your PC, you'll regret.

So I dont know why people are whining about picture quality, I am going from a Canon SD300, and the pictures on the Sony look much better. Plus I got a great deal on a black unit for $280.00 direct from Sony! I just wish it was a tad smaller. I think this model is so much better looking then the T-100 and I love the touch screen, which is one reason I opted out of the T-100 and saved $120.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Wonderful Product!", "Author": "melon10", "ReviewID": "R3SC7J22BUPLOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works great!  Took in on vacation to a number of international destinations, and it worked flawlessly and took excellent pics!  Easy to use, and especially loved the sliding lens cover/on-off functionality...just slide the front of the camera down to turn on rather than fumbling for a tiny on/off button.  made taking pics quick and easy.  Zoom and image stabilizer worked great!  Large LCD is excellent, even in bright daylight! and the touchscreen was the best!

I've taken it everywhere, used it every single day, treated it without proper care and it keeps on working.The big LCD is or was at least something people love about this camera, great for showing the shapshot you just took of them.The \"special thing\" this camera has is how discreet it looks, without a \"telescoping lens\". And when you shut the cover up, not only you protect the camera pretty well, you also make it look less like...a camera. Good if you travel or take it to places where it could be an easy prey for thiefs.

My greatest disappointment has been the form factor.  That very used to carrying the lightweight 1/4\" thin T7 in my shirt pocket and with the knit out as needed.  It appears that the new machine weighs twice as much and is about 1/2\" thick.  Although it fits into my shirt pocket it is no longer neat appearing and as convenient to whip out.
