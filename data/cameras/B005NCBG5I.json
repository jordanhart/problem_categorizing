I was blown away when he got clear video in a gym with only emergency lights on. We love the pics, too. But... when he left it in the swimming pool for a week (he's nine.... sigh...) it stopped working even after we dried the outside and then dried the inside and then switched batteries.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a point and shoot - what do you expect?", "Author": "S. M. Korby \"smkorby\"", "ReviewID": "R1QQQ3RDA545O7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It takes a steady hand to get a good picture. Just the shake from pushing the shutter is enough to ruin a photo. Doesn't work well in anything less than bright light. Color is good, but not the quality I am used to with a Canon Rebel.On the up side, the video works great. Surprisingly good quality video and sound. We got this camera because it works under water and got some great under water video. The photos were too shaky in the water to turn out. In the future we will continue to use the camera for the video feature, but not for the photos unless it just isn't feasible to carry around a larger camera.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon AW100 -with GPS, shockproof and waterproof...great point n shoot cam for any season", "Author": "jeffcons", "ReviewID": "R1EYNN5FY9YIJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got my Nikon AW 100 last year b4 my Tough Mudder event delivered at the right time and date when i needed it.
