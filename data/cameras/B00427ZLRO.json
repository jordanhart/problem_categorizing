{"Reviews": [{"Title": "P7000:  DSLR quality in a P&S; package", "Author": "AmyP", "ReviewID": "R3O71BE434PN60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let's get the facts out first. I've been a Nikon shooter for several decades, currently with a D300 (haven't made the leap yet to full frame, but that's next). I'm an amateur, but shoot at a pro level. My focus is on music and sports photography, and I like to have a good camera with me when I travel (my last ride-along P&S; has been a Lumix DMC-TZ5). I shoot in a variety of conditions, but what I need must a) provides high quality images, b) be really portable (fits in my purse, can get into concerts that ban DSLRs unless you're shooting on assignment) c) have a longer lens option (200mm is 'table stakes') and d) provide the flexibility to twiddle the dials to find the best combo of ISO-aperture-shutter speed for a particular situation. Having HD capability is a nice-to-have.I've been shopping for a new P&S; easily for a year. Got interested and then uninterested in the Canon G11/G12/S95 because the lens is too short (even the extenders don't push it out far enough). Similar higher-end P&S; cameras don't have the length I was looking for, or didn't fit the size criteria (ruled out the 'super zooms' largely because of this).Nikon got my attention first with the P100 - but I read about image quality issues. When I learned about the P7000, I was intrigued. Could Nikon overcome its perceived issues and produce a P&S; that makes picky photo people happy?I made the plunge and bought the P7000. After reading a few more reviews and having a burst of post-purchase cognitive dissonance, the best plan was to just take the new acquisition out and A:B it against my D300 and the Lumix in a variety of conditions.I'm glad I did. First impression:  lots of dials to set and menus to learn, so to make it easy I just left it on the 'green' setting and let the camera make the decisions. Immediately it was clear that the Lumix's photo quality wasn't even in the same class as the P7000 (it looked good until you held it up against the others). The P7000's quality should be compared against the DSLR class.After carrying a DSLR rig around, the P7000 seemed like a featherweight around the neck. Great build quality - solid metal feel. I don't like the AE-L and AF-L button being next to where you thumb is, but my fingers will learn. (Wish there was a wriststrap option that shipped with the camera too.) LOVE the display, and the ability to see the histogram data. Feels like my D300 in many ways.Now to the images. Shot with the D300 and the P7000 looking up a tree trunk. Depth of field, image clarity and WB were surprisingly similar. Wow. Tried it again in both indoor and outdoor conditions, and saw little to no difference. In fact I preferred the P7000 images several times to the D300 - they looked better (Note 1 below). After several hours of shooting both cameras, my post-purchase cognitive dissonance was gone and I am eager to learn more about my new traveling 'friend'.I do agree with the reviewers who note that the dials and settings aren't particularly intuitive. The instruction manual is about on the scale of a DSLR. It also - for now - lacks the really long lens capability I'm looking for (I believe that Nikon will be introducing accessories soon, including a telephoto extender). I wish that the lens were faster in the lower end, and I wish that Nikon did a better job of removing high ISO noise (this is a criticism for non-full frame Nikon bodies in general; I'm hoping that RAW and post-processing will clean this up). But the advantages of the camera - DSLR-like photo quality, Nikon fit/finish and build, and a longer lens than comparable high-end P&S; - make me believe that Nikon is going in the right direction and that this is a break from its previous P&S; cameras.If you don't have size constraints (as I do), buy a DSLR - you will get more in the long run. If you want DSLR-like performance in a P&S;, definitely take a look at the P7000.(Note 1: A good DSLR rig with good glass will take better photos than a point-and-shoot in virtually all situations - that's simple physics. I've not given up my DSLRs, but am recognizing the fact that the P7000 has the ability to shoot photos at the same level of quality in the outdoor/daylight conditions - low ISO - in which I ran my comparison. Higher ISOs for low light conditions do introduce more noise, and this is an expected function of the sensor in this class of camera. When I'm shooting 'serious', I still take the DSLRs. Use this camera on the path to a DSLR, since it has many of the same control features, or as a supplement for times when you don't want to carry the 'big rig' or can't because of constraints where you will be shooting.)-------------------------UPDATE: I've put about 1,000 shots into the camera over the past week, including one day of a music festival where I shot all but maybe 3 shots with the P7000 (see the photos here -[...]data is on). Net: though I still have not figured out the nuances, you can get really good photos out of the camera, but it does require learning how to use its capabilities. It is slower than the DSLR, but not so bad that it gets in the way of getting the shot. The P7000 has developed an issue where the lens cover will not retract completely, which causes the corners of the frame to be shaded. So, this must be sorted out. This is unfortunately not what I expected from Nikon, even in the first release. I'll report back in based upon what I find out, but for now I'm keeping the 5 star rating.UPDATE (NOV 2010):  The camera returned from Nikon in time to take to SFO. Nikon adjusted the shutter (works fine now) and the white balance. Interestingly the shot count was advanced about another thousand, so I trust they took the time to really check it out. I've finally figured out how to do quick aperture/shutter speed adjustments in manual mode, and am finding as I learn its controls and tricks, it's easier and easier to get great shots. I'm amazed at the 'night' setting - never fails to render something really interesting and usable. White balance in this mode has been most impressive - even in darkened rooms and in street shots at night, the photos come out rendered in the right colors, in focus and with plenty of light. I'm keeping the 5-star rating.UPDATE (Feb 2011): The shutter has not hung up again but the service guy who looked at it last noted that he thought some of the parts were 'worn'. I still really enjoy the camera, but did purchase a 3 year extended warranty. I would recommend that anyone else do the same if they buy it in the near future, up until the time that the reports of the shutter issue die off. I'm attributing it to the initial release of a very new camera design, and there are often things they will improve upon over time. But in contrast, my new D7000 is working like a champ right out of the box, leading me to surmise that their design and manufacturing standards may be higher for their DSLRs than their P&S; cameras. Just an observation - does anyone else have a similar experience?UPDATE (Mar 2011): Spoke with a Nikon person during SXSW who advised me to make sure I had the firmware updates loaded into the camera. Another reviewer commented that it's still in beta - I would tend to believe that. Still enjoying the camera. I did tell him that I am wishing for them to take a great low-light sensor and put it into a P&S; footprint, and he noted that pretty much everyone wants that too.

If you want a pocket camera that can fit into shirt pockets, jean pockets, etc then this is not the camera for you and you really should look elsewhere.  For me, it's the perfect size, not too big and not too small.  The camera is solid but not too heavy.Picture quality -- I shoot mainly in RAW and the quality so far is excellent.  Little noise up to ISO400 and usable to ISO800.  Can go to 1600 in a pinch.Autofocus -- Focus is fast and accurate.  There are options for Autofocus, Macro Focus, Infinity, and Manual Focus.  Be sure to read the manual and spend time understanding the focus options.  Some people are reporting focus issues and I believe many are related to users not learning enough about the focus system.Write speed -- This is where I would have given a 4 1/2 instead of a 5 if I could.  JPG write speeds are good but RAW is fairly slow and doesn't appear to buffer.  It doesn't affect me much based on the way I take pictures but there are times that it would be nice if it were faster.  Of course if you shoot JPG then this is a non-issue.ProsCustomizationBattery lifeViewfinder (I don't use it too often but nice when you need it)Image qualityZoom rangeMenus (intuitive, easy to use.

Collins", "ReviewID": "R12KQD4XC8R6GJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my wife for Christmas. In March while out on a photo shoot of wildflowers the Lens Cover stopped opening fully. Since it was past Amazon's 30 day return window I went to Nikon's Website and set up a return to repair facility. At this point I was somewhat disappointed but understanding of the fact sometimes things don't go completely correctly and had high expectations of Nikon making things right. I sent off to Nikon(on my dime) and after a few weeks they replied the camera would be repaired under warranty. So far so good. After about a month and a half the camera was returned. The first time we took it out it immediate exhibited the same Lens Cover not retracting issue. Now I will have to look forward to sending it back to Nikon (on my dime) and waiting a couple of months for Nikon to \"repair\". Not what I expected from Nikon. We have vacation planned for next month and the whole idea of purchasing this camera was to have one which took quality photos but was easier to carry around than our D40x. Now it looks like I will have to purchase an equivalent size camera from Canon or another company if we don't want to carry the D40x.....I should have read others reviews before purchasing as I see this issue is not unique to us.Update:I contacted Nikon Customer Support and they sent me a pre-paid shipping label since the problem was back less than six months from their \"repair\". I can't complain that I had to ship back \"on my dime\". Still unhappy the camera has been at repair facility for about 1/3 of the time I have owned it.Update:After a few weeks my wife called and checked on repair. Nikon stated it was shipping out the next day. After a couple of weeks it hadn't showed up and she checked back. Nikon then stated the repair had not started yet. Since it was less than a week until our big trip my wife was upset and let Nikon know it. They agreed to send a NEW camera to replace our original one. It arrived in time for trip and so far it works OK. Hope the lens cover issue does not reappear. I will update if anything else goes wrong or if everything goes right (fingers crossed)Update:Camera performed flawlessly during vacation. Took ~ 1500 photos. However, the week after our return the *NEW* camera started exhibiting the same lens cover problem. So far we have had to send to Nikon twice, once for repair and once for replacement.We plan on contacting Nikon and asking for a refund.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply fantastic", "Author": "G. Wright \"Wrighty\"", "ReviewID": "R1UMZ7LG6T7231", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for a camera like this from Nikon for years and was about to go for the Canon G11 when the P7000 (and G12) came out. The specs were exactly what I'd wanted - a lower pixel count with higher ISO, larger, higher res screen than the P6000 with faster RAW processing and a greater range in the lens. I looked at the G12 but decided on the Nikon and I'm glad I did.I shoot a D700, but wanted something I can take everywhere and I've just been blown away with the P7000. The controls take a little getting used to if you are familiar with the Nikon DSLR range, but ISO, QUAL, WB setup are almost the same and you get three custom settings U1, U2 and U3 where you can save common configurations such as low light (as the auto ISO ranges from 100-200, 100-400 and 100-1600 so it is a good idea ifyou use low light and want 3200 or Hi1 to set this up as a U setting rather than changing the ISO - I setup mine as U3). You can also reprogram 3 of the standard buttons to shortcuts and there is a MyMenu which is really hand for commonly used settings.Manual is a bit fiddly as the +/- sensor is a bit slow and too small to use dynamically as the light meter setting shows up yellow on white (not much contrast) whereas the Aperture and Shutter priority are as fast as they are on a DSLR and are really clear. One really nice feature is the real time histogram, if you use histograms this will save you a lot of time and missed shots as you can see your shot will be over or under range before you shoot - but then the matrix sensor is pretty hard to fool. I'm not a fan of bracketing, why not get the shot right first time around, but if you are a bracketing fan this too works well on the P7000 and can be setup on another U for when you want to make doubly sure you get the shot.Image quality is amazing for a point and shoot like this, even at full optical zoom it will really make me think twice when travelling as to whether to lug your DSLR.There is plenty of distortion in the lens, but not complex and easily corrected in Photoshop (not sure if NX2 does this automatically as with the D700).I've no idea why Nikon bothered with the flash hot shoe, if you stick a flash on it you may as well use your DSLR and with the low light handling and VR of the P7000 as well as a steady hand you can take superb low light shots, and the little inbuilt flash more than suffices when high ISO's are not enough.One thing I love is the view finder. I'm happy to use the screen to take a shot but in daylight you are often guessing at what you are shooting and the viewfinder provides an pretty good alternative. An accurate DSLR viewfinder it isn't, but it zooms as the lens zooms and it is accurate enough to get the shot. Apparently it is an 80% viewfinder, I think that is an average as it seemed to vary over the range but you do get used to it pretty quickly, especially with the P7000's zoom stops.All in all the P7000 is just superb. I'm glad I waited and at 85% of the weight of the G12, longer zoom (the lens is rated slower at 5.6 vs 4.5 with the G12, but then the P700 runs to 200mm whereas the G12 is 140mm - they are probably similar at around 140mm).I'm sure Nikon will have a better model in 2 years, but at this stage I can't even imagine what would entice me to buy it as the P7000 has it all.Thank you Nikon and well done.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon P7000 Shoves Canon G Series aside", "Author": "Edward G. Dickau \"Ed. Dickau\"", "ReviewID": "R3QQ7LN7CD9OLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really get tired of people who write reviews and have no idea of what they are talking about. I have been a photographer since 1958 and haave used/experimented with everything from (A) Alpa to (z) Zephyr. A Nikon devotee I will say right up front that the Coolpix P 7000 is not a camera for those who are given to setting cameras in the (P) mode and white light balance to Auto. With the D3x, D700 and D90 in my camera cabinet I can tell you that the P7000 deserves to be in that company. Yes there is a bit of a lag if you are shooting in the Fine mode with both RAW and JPEG files being recorded, but that would be true of any camera in this \"Bridge Class\" of cameras.I put this camera through its paces at the Newseum here in Washington DC and in areas where flash was forbidden, historic documents and front pages with White Light balanced to incandescent the aging document colors remained accurate and at ISO 1600 I was able to hand hold without difficulty and without loosing a shot, producing 300 DPI 11 (x) 14 and 16 (x) 20 print files. In fact the only time I used the flash, set a fill-flash was to photograph a brass Lion outside of the Capital Grill. Bare burning sunlight lit up the right side and the fill flash balanced the left side shadow area to absolute perfection. That photo is a flawless 16 (x) 20 file that reveals every bit of weather damage and Pigeon droppings.Spot metering the interior of a hanging Helicopter interior, conveniently approximately 50% Grey value the sensor recorded every color, hue and tonality faithfully.Exterior photos from the observation deck produced picture perfect postcard renditions of the Capital and surrounding buildings.The camera uses all of my external Nikon Flash cords and set up on a Stroboframe Pro \"T\" bracket makes for a very appropriate compact carry unit Compared with a good number of cameras in this class, all competent, the controls of the P7000 suit me to a, excuse me, a \"T\". The Stroboframe 300 QRC plate is a wonderful fit for tripod mounting. I have left it mounted to the camera as I habitually carry the small Bogen Manfrotto 3422 Table Top tripod around with me and use when needed bracing it against anything handy.I used that setup in the nearby St. Mary's Cemetery doing some test scouting in anticipation of Fall Fog and Winter Snow. The rendering of the head stones was simply amazing; no other word, and the detail of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in the back ground was superior to anything my Canon G cameras have produced.Every camera has its strengths and weakness. If you want a swing out display buy something else and don't Complain. I don't like them and too many of my friends have had to send their equipment out for repair after minor knocks. I'm old school I guess and I carry a 4 ft. square of Black denim in my camera Bag and play Matthew Brady when I need to see the LED display in overwhelming light. It works just fine.After over 250 photos with this camera I have dumped two. They were my errors.If you read/study the manual, practice and utilize the white light balance control, change ISO appropriate to the Challenge, change meter pattern as dictated you will love this little gem.As for any 1,2,3 ratings; I have to assume that those folks are either novices or Canon detractors. I have used them all and don't slant my appraisals. The Canon G series has much to offer but the Nikon P7000 does everything I want it to. Also you might want to looks up some of the reviews from the recent Photokina Trade show in Cologne where the P7000 was the hands down winner over the G12.Can't wait for the accessory attachment tube to available.

Mullins \"Book to Book\"", "ReviewID": "RR9GKH3AV0F1A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like the P7000 as I own Nikon DSLR's, but I just can't recommend it over the Canon G11 (or G12).  First, the P7000 is slower than the G11 in most every way.  The G11 zooms faster, scrolls through menus faster, magnifies photos you've already taken faster, and just feels snappier overall than the P7000. Shooting in RAW format is agonizingly slow on the P7000 and really only useful for landscapes as it takes 4 to 5 seconds to save each file, during which time the camera is locked up.  Second, while I like the menu system and access to functions on the P7000 overall, it's still a bit more of a disjointed experience than on the G11.  For example, to change the white balance on the P7000 you turn the Quick dial on the left side to WB, push the button, and then scroll over to the desired setting with the Multi-Selector wheel on the right side; it requires that you use both hands to accomplish this task.  On the G11 you simply press the function button with your right thumb and then use the control wheel to scroll to the desired setting; all major setting changes can be made with just your right thumb.  Finally, the P7000 exhibits more noise at ISO 1600 than the G11 which is kind of the required threshold for shooting in low light in doors without flash or having to worry about camera shake.Don't get me wrong, the P7000 is a very good camera. If you want to use an external flash and you already own Nikon speedlights then it's not a bad choice.  But it just doesn't quite measure up to the Canon G11 (or now G12).", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sticky Lens Cover", "Author": "P Herrera", "ReviewID": "R32RTV1G0RCWJL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased a Nikon P7000 for a family vacation to the Grand Canyon.  The lens cover that automatically folds out of the way when the camera is turned on did not retract fully when turned on.  Very frustrating since the unique photos of this family vacation have angled lens covers on many shots.  After one of my children reviewed the photos on the third night of our trip, he noticed an angled black area top and bottom of the photos.  I said WTF!  I bought this fairly expensive point and shoot from what I thought was a top flight manufacturer and am very disappointed.  Even if they fix the camera the photos are ridiculous and lost forever.

I've been playing with it ever since.  Here are a few notes, first of all, the photos are good and I'm surprised at the relatively low noise up to 1600 ISO.  It does have some limits in terms of exposure range though, with more blown out hightlights than the larger sensor in the D70 and D200, my other cameras.Potential owners should realize that this camera is a serious tool and definitely not recommended for beginners.  I have a feeling there may be some disappointed owners if they buy this thinking it's a basic digicam.  It is packed with buttons and dials, so much so that it's hard to pick it up there's not much room to hold it and when taking a photo, there is very little room for the left hand to hold the camera.  Even the pinch doesn't work if the flash is popped up on the upper left hand corner.I use my cameras almost exclusively for professional work, taking product photos at trade shows for a large website. The P7000 has many features that can be tweaked and customized -- probably more than any of my DSLR's, which is good for pros but not for basic snapshooters.I've been reading the P7000 owner's manual over and over, page by page, working through the camera to try and learn every feature.  It's a bit daunting, as the manual is not the most user friendly thing you'll ever read and it takes several read-throughs to figure out what they're trying to tell you.Another issue is that there are sometimes 3-4 different ways of doing the same thing (changing the settings), which can be confusing.The first thing I noticed is what other people have commented on, this is a slow camera.  Everything about it, changing menus, even switching from photo mode to playback mode, takes time.  It's like it's using an old, slow CPU or something.  I hope they fix that in a firmware upgrade.The RAW issue doesn't bother me, because I almost never use RAW. But I tried it and it isn't as bad as people say -- so it takes a couple of seconds to save the file -- big deal.  The way some people are talking, you could make a cup of tea in the time it takes to save a RAW file.  Don't believe it.The other thing that does bother me and that I hadn't realized is that it apparently only stops down to f8.0.  I was surprised when I discovered this just today. So taking a macro shot at f8.0 of small products means some areas are out of focus, I usually stop down to f14 or so for this work.Another quirk is that apparently (so far anyway) you can't adjust the amount of time the image stays on the screen after the shot was taken?  I don't see a way to change that.  Also, it's too easy to turn the camera on by pressing the flush on/off button when you're picking up the camera.  The button should be recessed.  And I've picked it up a couple of times and accidentally touched the playback button on the back, and surprise, this turns the camera on also.  So be careful when you put the camera back in your bag, if you hold it wrong, you'll be turning it back on without realizing it.But overall, as a pro I'm glad it has so much adjustability.  The video isn't bad either, at 720p and .mov file format it's just enough for me to take some quick video of products for a quick edit in Premiere Elements and an upload.Don't get me wrong, I like the camera a lot and it's perfectly suited for what I do, but it's not as easy to use as I thought it would be.  And by the way, I've tried my SB-400 flash on it also and it works fine, I haven't tried my SB-600 or SB-800 yet, which would be overkill, but I'm going to give them a try just for kicks.By the way, I agree also with the other commenter who said the display doesn't show the image as it should with the focus and exposure and depth of field -- it shows you the \"live\" TV-like view, then you take the photo, then have to go into the playback mode to see how the photo looks, then back to shoot mode.  Not fun.  Also, as I mentioned above, the photo only displays for a few seconds, not really enough to see it after it's been taken and I don't see a way of controlling how long the photo remains on the LCD.  Hopefully, this will be fixed in a firmware update.  I hope...UPDATE: I tried my SB-800, the P7000 knows it's on there because the little external flash icon lights up, but the flash doesn't fire.  No error messages or anything; push the shutter release and nothing happens, no photo, no flash.  I put the SB-400 back on and it works fine.  I plan on emailing Nikon to see what the official word is on this.  Not sure how many people would want to use an SB-600 or SB-800 on the camera, but you never know.UPDATE 2: Here's another curious feature of the P7000.  If it's in A (aperture priority) or S (shutter priority) and the ISO is set to auto or auto high, when the camera is switched to M (manual), the ISO reverts back to 100.  So if you use Aperture priority to get a sense of what the camera likes for exposure settings, then switch to Manual to tweak it a bit (something I often do), you have to remember to go in and reset the ISO also.  Kind of strange I think and not like my DSLRs where the ISO stays constant.The U (User settings) can help here; the Mode Dial has 3 available user settings (U1, U2, U3) that allow you to save a configuration set where the camera settings are configured to your preferences.Again, my feeling is that this would not be a good camera for beginners -- it's highly customizable, almost to a fault, even for experienced users.  Of course, you can always leave it on Auto and shoot away, but then you'd probably be better off with a S6000 or something.I'm a little disappointed, I just think other competing cameras are easier to use than the P7000.  The last thing I want to be doing when I'm taking photos at one of my trade shows is messing with a bunch of camera settings.  I guess I'll just leave it on Auto and plug in my SB-400 and hope for the best, but then I feel like I'm not taking full advantage of the camera's capabilities and my photo skills.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lens cover issues - Nikon P7000", "Author": "rg", "ReviewID": "R1OUA9OZTIJS0Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera is good, but the lens cover will not fully open when turned on.

MOST of the shots posted were made with some obstacle - low light - overcast and drizzle - silly distances to test the digital zoom etc.. Most of the shots include camera data so you can see what the speed, aperture, and the focal length of the zoom lens in a 35mm format.If you know your D300 the function controls are familiar as are what the settings will do for you. The camera handled the challenges thrown at it surprisingly well. This is the most flexible camera in a point and shoot I have seen to date, and definitely the best value overall. It is larger than your typical P&S;, similar to the Cannon G Series but the functions are more like like a Nikon DSLR than not.The P7000 is the ideal camera for three groups of people:1. DSLR users that want a better back up camera with a long zoom, a more portable camera for everyday picture opportunites, and dislike the lens speed and quality and/or the lack of flexibility in most *not all* P&S; offerings.2. P&S; shooters that are not interested in a DSLR but want better shots and the ability to be more creative, that may also want good shots were most P&S; products fail them.3. P&S; shooters that aspire to owning a DSLR that want an easy transition to Nikon's DSLR family of products. A P&S; P7000 owner will have a very small learning curve when they make the transition to Nikon's semi-pro and professional line. The PS7000 for this group will shorten the learning curve dramatically and the camera will still have value when they transition to the DSLR lineup. Moreover, the P7000 will still be useful as an everyday camera for the unexpected shot opportunities normally missed for not having a good enough camera, or getting a DSLR into action quickly enough.I think Nikon made some very wise decisions on this camera. One of them was limiting the optical zoom range to 28-200mm. The quality of zooms that drop below 28mm is generally poor if they zoom lower than 28mm and still go up to 200mm. The same is true of zooms that go from 28mm to over 200/250mm on the high end of the zoom. Adding to the zoom range on either side impacts the cost for good quality. Check out the price of Nikon's 28-300mm consumer lens and you will see the price sky rockets. The lowest aperture also goes up faster than most of us want on the high end of zoom. 28-200mm is the sweet spot for quality and cost effective. Nikon's digital zoom takes you to 300mm with a small amount of digital magnification that is acceptable and significantly reduces camera shake since you are really shooting at 200mm. I do not encourage it but have 800mm shot uploaded for you. Pushing this camera to 300mm with the Digital Zoom is a walk in the park and may save you time in cropping later in post processing.Anyone that has shot at extreme distances with a Nikkor 800mm f/5.6s IF-ED knows what I am talking about. Try carrying it all day and then setting up this 5kg plus lens, without the camera attached, fast and then manually focusing it for a shot that is time critical to capture the subject. Yes, the quality of the lens is awesome but last time I checked it was still well over 20 - 40 times as expensive as the P7000.Hand holding lenses in the 600-800mm is not that different from shooting ground hogs at 300-400 yards. It requires a steady hand and good breathing techniques. Nikon takes the pain out this by optically magnifying the 200mm lens which reduces the problem of camera shake dramatically. The picture angle of an 800mm lens is only 3 degrees so what Nikon has done with the P7000 makes sense.I like the Cannon G11 and G12. They are both good cameras and very similar. They take good pictures but they have no where near the flexibility of the P7000 for someone that that is or will take the time to learn how to use the functions built into the P7000. Some of the comments and comparisons about the two cameras are irrelevant to me in terms of taking real life pictures, especially the ones that require a long lens as is desirable for birding. Most menu settings are done prior to taking pictures based on the anticipated light, weather conditions, and activity or movement of the subject being captured. The adjustments needed to take pictures when shooting are readily available. The P7000 is made for catching candid shots when it is set up right for the task at hand.**** Note Insert ******I seriously ticked off one of our readers when i mentioned the G11/G12. He thought it was confusing and not objective. While reviewing the P7000 here I felt the need to mention that the P7000 does have credible competition. Not only the Canon G12 but also the Panasonic Lumix LX5 which has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. When writing the above paragraph it also occurred to me that not everyone will want the learning curve to even notice some of the P7000 features that are important to me. They may not even want or need the additional features and the longer zoom lens on the P7000. Because of this I went through what I think about the two cameras in detail highlighting more than a few things about each of these cameras, and what each does best which is highly subjective. There is no one best fixed lens camera for every shooting situation. I like the extra sharp pictures the P7000 produces and think it is a great camera but it is not number one in every single category.****** END *********One of the cons I read here before buying the camera was that the zoom is not fast enough. The P7000 zoom and auto-focus are very quick in the optical zoom range. It is only when you get to the digital zoom range when it clicks incrementally that it slows down. Nikon is intentionally alerting you that you have left the optical zoom range because each click going forward will lessen the quality because lpm will decrease and the errors will be magnified by the digital zoom. Take a look at my hand held digital zoom shots using the Digital Zoom and judge for yourself but remember they were enhanced in post processing which will take a couple of minutes are more depending on your experience.Another con I read was the taking flash shots indoors. The P7000 wants a Nikon smart flash like the SB600 or SB900. Superior results on flash with the right flash attachment with this camera is very simple.The first thing I typically do with a point and shoot is turn the digital zoom off because my experience with zooms is that the overwhelming desire to get closer is more than most of us can resist. Nikon's digital zoom works fine if you are willing to take the time with post processing which the image will need if the subject is a small portion of the screen like the ones I took for testing the camera. The shot I posted is at 800mm is hand held and acceptable considering it was shot wide open at f/5.6 at about 1/100 second and ISO 400 intentionally to stress the camera along with others.Night shots are incredible with the P7000. Seriously good with no fiddling with settings. Anyone can take an excellent low available light picture with the P7000. The light has to be really low to even need a flash on the P7000 except for back lighted subjects. I took shots at up to 12800 by forcing the shutter speed up and or forcing the aperture to higher number and they look great.The lens and focus are plenty fast enough with VR to be pleasant but having the manual focus available for small objects is an option if or when you need it. The VR in the P7000 is excellent. Hand holding shot at f/2.5-3 stops works fine. Take at look at the night shot which taken at 1/6 second instead of 1/30th second which exceeds 3 stops hand held. The manual focus magnifies the center of the picture so when you see it in focus there you are good to go.The P7000 is a seriously remarkable camera in  many respects at a very fair price. I would recommend it to anyone. Take time to read the manual. This camera has a lot of the same functions used by Nikon on their Digital SLRs. If you understand the functions and their settings you will have hours of fun with this camera and discover there are many ways to take a picture which is where the real fun is for me.This is like any other piece of equipment. You have to use it in a variety of situations to get the feel for how it performs when shooting. I found this camera is easier and faster to adjust than most. It does not take too long to get comfortable with the menus. Getting to the scene menu is not really hard but honestly not as fast and not really needed if you know what you are doing with the function settings available externally on the camera. You will not miss many shots with the P7000. The P7000 rocks in terms of picture quality for being a zoom lens!The zoom lens is not up to an 85mm f/1.4 fixed lens in resolving power, but that lens without the camera body is twice the price of this camera and lens. The reality is no one makes a zoom lens can Nikon's best 85mm f/1.4 ED manual focus lens. The P7000 lens produces better than necessary quality for most users. It produces shots that are definitely on a par with DSLR Lenses in the same price range as the P7000. This is one of the side benefits of the Nikon using the 1/1.7 sensor; we get affordable optics.I do not understand the obsession with shooting raw files as it is not really necessary for the bulk of most people's shooting. Yes raw files can be useful but not that often. The reality is that most people do not even need fine jpegs. When you are shooting with extreme situations or a once in a life time shot and you know it turn it on, but otherwise raw files just eat disk space and are not that necessary with today's processing software. Raw files do give us the ability to recover missing data from a miserable shot where something was wrong with the setup. The scene exceeds the camera's ability to handle the dynamic range leaving shadow detail out, or over exposing burns out the highlights of the jpeg. This is not an every day occurrence for most shots. This camera takes good pictures so why bother with raw unless you have situation where you need it. Nikon's 1.2 firmware update cuts write time roughly in half for raw file formats and improves save time for jpegs too so this is resolved now for those that feel they have to have raw files.The P7000 also offers accessories that are worth considering depending on how you will use the camera. One combination will give you a 21mm camera with no zoom which is exciting news for the wide range enthusiasts. The other is a wireless remote that is very inexpensive and worth every dime. Wireless remotes are very useful devices. Nikon's is fairly priced but others like Opteka's work as well.If you do not have any knowledge and do not care to know anything the P7000 will still give you great pictures, but knowing the options offers an assortment of creative options. When you receive your camera be sure to charge it - at longest an hour and half. While the battery charges register yourself and your camera at Nikon.Download the new 1.2 firmware for the P7000 with the instructions and the P7000 manual in a PDF format. Read the manual and play with the camera settings and you will discover a whole new world of fun in taking pictures if you are not a Nikon DSLR owner already.Nikon's new 1.2 firmware makes a major difference to the P7000 and also resolves the mechanical problem of the lens cover not closing 100 percent of the time. Do not be afraid to update the firmware in the P7000; read the instructions and follow then. It is easy for both Mac and PC users.Then have fun with this excellent camera!", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Known Defect - Lens Cover Doesn't Fully Open", "Author": "Michael Perine \"Powder Obsessed\"", "ReviewID": "R3TVQ7KYIKZ82I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has a known defect, the blades on the lens cover stop opening.

I am not a fast shooter and I'm not a sport shooter. This camera travels with me in a car's glove compartment and so, it is always with me. In last 7 years I owned/used/rented a whole bunch of camera equipment and here are some things I must to mention.First, I don't like and don't want DSLRs. Yes they all produce better quality, cleaner images. But I take images not to scrutinize them under x1000 magnification. I print from time to time as large as 13x19 and this camera provides all that I need. I am tired of heavy cameras that stay at home because they are heavy, and because they are stay at home they are not fun. This camera is fun.If you are not some super-duper professional (who uses medium format digital anyway), this camera provides nice quiet and comfortable operations.Second to mention, is that imagers are so much improved during last 2-3 years, that this 1/1.7 sensor, kicks a butt of my older Pentax k10 and Sony's DSC-R1 (both are 10mp of large 23x15 sensors) in practically every every way. For my purposes of fun photography, family, on wall artwork etc, this camera provides everything I need. It includes incredible optics, that you will spend at least 4K to match in dslr world (including macro).Third. It is very well equipped camera. I got for it a leather case, and I don't need anything else.And the last one. Some people tend to go into camera wars sorts of this camera vs. G12 etc. I had my hands on G12 and it is very competent and nice camera as well. Canon's Digic 4 is amazing, no questions about it. They both produce great images. I picked this only because of personal preferences, nothing more. The JPGs out of this camera are super clean and nice. I don't shoot raw, unless it is something very challenging and worthy of latter efforts.I also DO LIKE the video this cam produces.

I tried again to use this camera and give it a second chance.  It continually froze up and had to be turned off and turned back on.  The zoom feature is worthless and the view finder is poor.  You will not be happy with this camera and I suspect that the P7100 is equally flawed.  My recommendation is to look at the Fuji X10 or the Canon G12.  The Fuji seems to be better than either the Nikon or Canon.Below is my first review of this camera.  After using it for some time, I wish I could send it back.Lens does not focus well.  Writes raw files slowly. Zoom often does not work and camera must be turned off. Occasionally, camera freezes and must be reset.  This camera is a mediocre point and shoot that is supposed to rival the excellent Canon G series. It fails and I would think carefully before buying.  Below is my first review; after using for some months, the same problems still bother me.Before you purchase, I suggest that you read an article by Thom Hogan comparing Nikon, Canon, and Panasonic.  It is quite complete and discusses issues that are mentioned in other comments here.  His issues with this camera are serious and he is a Nikon user.I have used Nikon cameras for over thirty years and have been waiting for Nikon to produce a good point and shoot that would rival the Canon G series.  The P7000 may be a very good camera; I am not sure yet as I believe that my particular camera may be defective.  Amazon has already sent me a replacement.I found that the telephoto zoom lever did not work all the time and did not go into extended mode at all.  I had to reset the camera to get the extended mode to work.  I did get help in resolving this issue from Nikon.I believe that there may be a focusing problem with this camera and others have reported similar findings.  I tried a series of close up images and almost none of them are in focus.I agree with those who have commented on the poor quality of the manual and want to add that much of the print is almost too small to read.  The small print is lighter than the regular size print.I am hopeful that my replacement camera will work well as others have commented on how much they like this camera.Buyers should be aware that the new Nikon raw files are not yet compatible with any Adobe products.I want to keep an eye out for other reviews to see if the problems that I have had are peculiar to me or if they are real problems with the camera. As of Dec 8th, it appears that the problems are real.I have continued to have problems with focusing at close distances.The camera is slow particularly when shooting raw.  There is now a beta upgrade from Adobe that I believe includes this Nikon raw format.There are rumors that the camera needs a firmware update.  While I have kept the camera, in retrospect I wish that I had waited until Nikon made necessary improvement for this camera.Dec 22 - The firmware update has been released but it does not solve all the problems.  Adobe has released Camera Raw for this camera for both Lightroom and Photoshop.  HOWEVER Nikon does not seem to support its own product.  I have tried to open with Capture NX2 and the files will not open.I have kept the camera but I would strongly recommend that others wait before buying this camera.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent P&S; picture quality", "Author": "Honibee", "ReviewID": "RW8JRG0ZKDEEN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Picture quality and optics are excellent for a P&S.; The LCD display is great, and I like the \"virtual horizon\" option.The 7x optical zoom is ideal.The ergonomics of the P7000 is surprisingly good given some of the complaints I've heard, though it takes just a little getting used to. There is a dial on the left which gives quick access to ISO, white balance and image quality (raw/jpg), and you can control the aperture and/or shutter with a wheel on the right hand side. The P7000 is much lighter than a DSLR, and feels comfortable around my neck with the included strap. It can fit into a jacket pocket or a purse, but not into most pants pockets. It has a nice grip and is easy to hold. I like having the viewfinder, even though I only have used it in bright daylight. It cannot compare with a DSLR viewfinder, but it does zoom with the lens, and is handy to have when it is hard to see the LCD display.The RAW format needs to be converted using the provided ViewNX2 software into jpg or tiff first. ViewNX2 is pretty basic, but works reasonably well. The supplied panarama software also cannot read RAW.The camera came with the original firmware (v1.0), but it was straightforward to update it to v1.1. With the firmware upgrade, the RAW write time is down to about 2 sec, not too much more than a jpg, and I have not encountered the \"can't focus\" error common with the original firmware. On the other hand, the camera sometimes has problems focusing at infinity (for landscapes). This can be fixed by switching from autofocus to landscape focus, but this should not be necessary.There is a bit of a lag after changing settings to get back to into shooting mode. This is a little irritating but not too much of a big deal.In comparing the P7000 to the Canon S95 and G12, all have the same sensor and take good pics. The S95 is the most portable and has the f/2 lens; the G12 has the foldout LCD display, while the P7000 has the longest zoom.Update after using this camera for a year: I continue to be impressed by the quality of the photos from this camera. My father is a semi-professional photographer who has a DSLR and also a Canon S-95 that he uses when he doesn't want to carry around the heavy DSLR, and he has told me that my P7000 takes better photos than the S-95. Even though it slows the camera down some, I have found that it is often worthwhile shooting in RAW mode - definitely allows for higher quality images and adjustments. Photoshop has updated their RAW module so that it can now read the RAW files from the camera. On the negative side, the camera can be slow in switching settings and between imaes, which has sometimes caused me to lose good shots. If you want to spend the extra $150, you might want to go with the P7100 which has faster response times. But if you are looking for a camera with excellent picture quality and a high degree of manual control at a reasonable price, the P7000 is a good option.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this camera", "Author": "jj1211", "ReviewID": "R2W8LQDBKSQVKC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't buy this camera.

I hae only used this camera for a few days, but I find it to be just what I was looking for - a P&S; with sophisticated user control and excellent image quality for times when I can't bring the D300. You might call it an adjust, point and shoot.  I do mostly nature and garden photography and a good deal of macro, so I will speak to this.  I have posted a few images of flowers, mushrooms etc I took with the camera out of the box.  As you might expect, ity takes a bit of practice and time with the manual to get the best out of the camera, but I find that using aperture priority and the macro focus setting with low iso gives me an image approaching what I can get with the DSLR.  Metering is usually spot on, but the exposure compensation dial is so handy and easy to use that I have to say adjustments are much easier than on the D300 or D90.  For those upgrading from a lower-priced P&S;, the grid, virtual horizon, and and real-time histogram should be a real plus.  I agree with others that the view finder is a bit of a joke, but it does add that buit of a retro touch - reminds me of the first cheap 35mm camera I had as a kid.  No question that it is easier to get a quality image with the D300 or the D90, but the compactness of this camera makes it a true alternative. I do find the focus/metering can be slow under certain conditions and occasionally the autofocus shuts down temporarily as the lens readjusts. This seems to happen when I shift from standard autofocus to macro.  It is frustrating that the new RAW format is not supported by Adobe at this point, but I will trust that this will be addressed in upcoming updates (I had this same problem with the D200 when it forst came out).

Ok, that's out of the way.Let me point out a couple obvious items,1. This is not an SLR, nor does it have a full frame or APS sensor.2. This is not a sub-compact.  It will not fit in the coin pocket in your jeans.  In fact unless your wearing cargos it won't fit in your pants.3. The resolution is 10MP.  You will not get 20MP images out of the camera.  Sorry.4. The review site are a mixed bag saying this is a nice try but not a good camera.  Ignore them, these are pros who compare every feature on every camera and lose a connection to reality.So none of this matters.First, if your are comparing this to another camera at the current price of $229, BUY THIS CAMERA NOW!  If someone offers you a Mercedes SLK for the same price as a Neon, don't try to compare the traits of the neon and the cobalt and talk yourself out of a luxury car.There is a reason this was a $500 camera.  It produces some of the best pictures of any point and shoot camera, the build quality is obvious when you grab it.  It is hefty, substantial, and feels like you know where your money went.  Let's put a little more perspective into build quality first.This camera has tight well fitted controls, a huge high quality screen, a clear nikkor lens in the 28mm to 200mm range, and a metal frame.  To all the people thinking why don't I just get an SLR, Nikon does have a consumer model SLR with all those feature stock.  It's a great camera, unfortunately not everyone can shell out for a Nikon D7000.  Really think about the build and your realize you aren't paying for a name.That's all wonderful, but I didn't buy this camera as a self defense item, it's a camera.  A good camera must take good pictures.  That is the primary reason you buy it.  Don't take my word for it, read the reviews, for this case I suggest the negative reviews, but listen to me first, firmware 1.2 fixes those complaints about write times and auto focus issues.  Now go look at the negative reviews.  Go ahead, I'll wait.Did you see it, every single site said the same thing, I\"it has X, Y, and Z problems, but it takes the best pictures of any Compact camera, or is in the top two or three.  I won't even bother telling you to look at the positive reviews.If you skim through the owners manual you'll figure out where the options are, and how the camera is organized.  Some of the sites badmouth the menu system, and it is a little confusing, especially if you get a chance to play with every digital camera that come to market and have 200 different points of reference to compare against.  Since I don't work for a camera review site, well it seemed pretty easy to me.  More importantly, my wife, who thinks PASM are scene settings was able to pick up and start using the camera immediately and loves the picture quality.  Her only points of reference are her old APS film camera, her Sony DSC-H7, and my Pentax K-x which she claims is \"intimidating and confusing\".Now let me set your expectations realistically,This Camera is not going to take images in pitch black.  If your SLR with a kit lens can't take the picture, this camera probably can't either.  If your kid is rampaging through the house he will still be a blur (although not so much outside).  The Macro setting is amazing.  The images you take will not be professional magazine grade images(all the time, there are some real gems though).  Getting this camera does not make you a better photographer(but learning to use it correctly and taking it with you everywhere can't hurt).  This camera is positioned between the cheap point and shoot you have or are considering and a good DSLR, as such it is not as fast as an SLR, or small as some P&S; cameras, but it produces images that can rival a good SLR and is convenient to carry around.  If you are like me and have a family, then you have an option when you go on outings, for example, you can go to the zoo with your family so you can drag out your SLR and lenses and take pictures, where you ignore your family and the zoo so you can take pictures or you can take a smaller camera where you can focus on the zoo and your family and then have pictures to remember why you went.executive summary:This camera is the perfect marriage of a convenient easy to carry compact camera and a high quality user controllable camera.  Unless you are a professional this will likely exceed your purposes for a long time.pros:great image qualitysolid build qualityfast autofocus(I'd insert a conditional, but in good lighting it's even comparable to some of the SLRs out there)plenty of controlsfun scene and settingsCons:As I mentioned earlier my wife loves this camera and as for the title of this review... I may need to buy another P7000, you know so I have a camera to use.Update(1/19/12):two things, like everyone else I've been wondering what case to get for this, I've gone into every electronics store in a 40 mile radius of my house, I finally made it to my local camera shop and stumbled on the Black Rapids SnapR 20Black Rapid SnapR Point and Shoot Camera Bag and Strap Systemit's fantastic, having the camera attached to the shoulder strap for the case adds to the old style rangefinder feel without looking quite so retro.  so If your wonder that, because these are big cameras I recommend that.Also I have been hit or miss this week on image quality with about 20% to 30% falling in the unusable realm, that being said I've been shooting outdoors after sundown trying out the different modes at night.  A 70% success rate for night shots in complex lighting is pretty good, think lighted signs at night across parking lots or water fountains in the dark.  Either way I tried to add a star but the system still limits me to a 5.  This camera goes with me everywhere.Update 1/25/12:So interesting thing, I'm shot about 221 pictures 2 videos, did a couple sound recordings on the camera and I still don't have the battery indicator up.  Battery hasn't been charged since the first charge when I got the camera.  I guess I'll post when I actually have to charge the battery, I know some of you will shoot far more than me, but for light use I've been very impressed that the battery has gone this far.Update 2/06/12:So I chickened out, the battery indicator came on after about 270 images and 7 or 8 minutes of video.  I didn't have to charge it, but I was going out with the family so I threw it on the charger that morning.  Even so, the camera has become my go to.  I'm starting to wonder if I should go ahead and buy the magic lantern guide.  I've read the manual, but I know there are features I either missed in the first read through or that I don't understand.Update 2/16/12:So, I'm learning, I've set u1 to manual focus, f5.7 iso 400 1/400 8mm and use it for just walking around quick snaps in bright outdoor conditions.  Cool.  it's fast.  it's stupid fast and stupid quiet, you could take someones picture to their face and they'd never know it.  at those settings you can temporarily allow autofocus and focus on something about 6 feet away and then not worry about focus for the rest of your cruising on those settings.  It's kind of the crop sensor version of f8 and be there.  I think it's largely because I always take this camera with me, but I feel I have taken more, good quality photos in a month with this camera than in 2 years with my dslr.UpdateSo a while back I bought the sb400 flash, and bam, want to freeze your rampaging child through the house, want to bounce your light, this is hands down an awsome combo.  except for special occasions(venus transit) I don't take out my SLR anymore.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can to the game, but not ready to play", "Author": "Milton A.

I bought this camera to have a small, reliable and capable take around with as many dslr features as possible. When I learned of this camera I really thought this was the perfect solution and my long wait was over. In addition, it was a Nikon and compatible with the Nikon flashes I own. Well, I really wanted to like this camera (ordered twice from Amazon) but it's short-comings were far to serious to make it a useful photographic tool. Now, after testing several different copies of this camera (two from Amazon, five from local camera stores) here's why I wouild not own this camera:  _____ At least 15-20% of pictures taken with indoor lighting are poorly focused (focusing on facial features being the worst case).  _____ Correct white balance is often difficult to acheive inspite of it's fine tuning adjustments.  _____ Vibration reduction seems to have very little impact on camera shake resulting in telephoto shots in moderate light being blurred.  _____ Camera defaults to 1/30 sec. shutter speed when shooting flash photography.Lastly, in the P7000 defense, when none of the about problems are encountered, this camera is capable of taking some amazing pictures.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nikon P7000 owner review", "Author": "Frank Abate", "ReviewID": "R1N0R6CYAIIA19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the P7000 after MUCH research. Best price was on amazon once no tax was considered (Wal-Mart had it somewhat cheaper, but have to pay sales tax). I also strongly considered the Canon G12, the most direct competitor to the P7000. I went with the Nikon because it is quite a bit cheaper ($379 vs. $450) and because I plan to get a DSLR down the road and will definitely go with Nikon then. The P7000 shares the same e-remote and the Nikon line of external flashes as its DSLRs.Features when compared to the G12 are very similar. The P7000 has optical zoom of 7x, better than the G12, and the zoom is viewable in the display and in the optical viewfinder. Worth noting that these two are about the only non-DSLRs left with an optical viewfinder, not as accurate as the display, but useful in bright sunlight.The G12 has a display that can be rotated, while the P7000 display is fixed. I did not care so much about that, but to those who do, there it is. Otherwise the P7000 has a very crisp and bright display.Nikon recommends getting a memory card rated at least Class 6 if you plan to shoot video. I read in the reviews of the P7000 that its write speed is very slow, so I went with a Class 10, 16GB card by Kingston. With that card you get over 5,700 shots at top setting of 10MB--wow!The settings available, including full manual, allow a lot of customization and flexibility. You have a 225-page manual to wade through, but some study brings great results. Sharpness, granularity, and noise at the ISO 100 setting outdoors are more than acceptable. You WILL NOT get results that a high-quality DSLR will give, but considering the fixed lens and the price (1/5th of a decent DSLR), shooting results are just fine.It's important to note that Nikon has released an update to the firmware, version 1.1, which is available for free download from the Nikon site and installs easily. I understand that the upgrade addresses some of the write speed slowness, though I cannot speak to this since I installed the upgrade the first day I had the camera.Reviews all say that the write speed is much slower than the G12. If it is important to you that you can take and save both JPEG and RAW quickly, the G12 is said to be a lot faster. Also, and importantly, I found the editing software from Nikon, which came on a CD with the camera, is klugey. Unfortunately, the P7000 saves the RAW data in the Nikon-proprietary .NRW format, which you can only make use of with Nikon software. I hope Nikon will change this, but who knows? I now use Picasa for editing, but cannot do anything with .NRW.The video quality with the P7000 is nothing short of excellent. This was not a high priority for me, but once I tried it I was very pleased and now plan to use it often.Other cool stuff: You can customize the setting for white balance such that you get great results indoors under several lighting conditions--incandescent and fluorescent. Settings and menus can be customized. You can record a voice memo with each photo.Battery life is said to be 350 stills. Video of course eats up more juice. I have found the battery life to be acceptable. The battery recharges in about an hour. I have ordered a second battery ($18) for backup.Build quality is very good, with a partly metal body. The camera feels solid. The body is large enough that you can keep big fingers (like mine) out of the way. Yet it is compact and light enough that you wouldn't hesitate to take it along just about anywhere.Overall, I am very pleased with the P7000, as my rating shows. And it is an excellent value for the money. But if you can afford it and are a Canon fan, you may want to go with the G12.

I even thought about buying Canon G12 but since I already have extensive Nikon gear, buying P series would allow me to use existing external Nikon flash.

I love it, but it's got a few annoying quirks that could all easily be addressed in firmware updates (fingers crossed).The Good: The color is spot-on under very challenging conditions. The images are rich, detailed and the noise levels are very good for a compact camera. The ergonomics are fantastic, I used to accidentally press buttons on the back of the Canon G11 with my right thumb, the P7000 has a rubber thumb rest and finger grip on the body, making it very comfortable to use. The multi-function dial allows for easy access to settings like ISO, WB, Image Quality, Bracketing and other settings. I like the pop up/push down flash, rather than having to navigate a menu to turn flash on and off. The camera works great with Nikon SB800 and SB900 strobes as well as the SU800 remote commander and of course Nikon TTL cords. I\u00a1\u00a6ve successfully synced a SB900 strobe via Pocket Wizards at manual shutter speeds up to 1/1000 \u00ba I like the semi-automatic ISO which can be set to use 100-200, 100-200-400. Very handy feature.The Bad: The camera takes a long time to write a large JPG and NRW file, even with a Class-6 SD card. Nikon NX2 software does not support the NRW files of the P7000 and I cannot find an update to resolve this issue on the Nikon USA website. If the camera is set for no flash and you put an SB900 on the hot shoe and turn the strobe on, it won\u00a1\u00a6t fire until you set the flash control of the camera to \u00a1\u00a5on\u00a1\u00a6. Seriously? If I put a flash on the hot shoe, and I power it up, I want flash.The Ugly: In manual mode, the LCD automatically adjust to show a natural rendering of the subject, regardless of the shutter speed and aperture settings. The manual exposure \u00a1\u00a5meter\u00a1\u00a6 is very small and it is easy to think your settings are fine, only to discover that you are way off and you have to wait a long time for the camera to record the \u00a1\u00a5bad\u00a1\u00a6 photo before you can make exposure corrections. I would much prefer for the LCD to approximate the resulting effect of the currently set shutter speed and aperture in the same way it previews the WB settings. Fingers crossed that Nikon can add a menu option for how the LCD display functions in manual mode along with the option for a much larger exposure meter display.If you are a Nikon shooter, the P7000 is a no-brainer.

This will not replace your DSLR nor will it take better photos than it. I bought it as a point and shoot that is basically used as an everyday camera but I wanted manual controls. The big reason for purchasing this camera was also the fact that it shoots in RAW. As a basic camera in everyday use, it's still overkill. I bought a $99 Panasonic Lumix point and shoot for my girlfriend and that camera takes stellar images for a reasonable price. Now back to the main reason to buy this: It's more portable than a DSLR, it'll get through any place that won't allow DSLR's, it shoots RAW, manual controls, and a somewhat manual focus mode as well.Images: The quality of the images are NOT comparable to a DSLR as they have noise from ISO 100 and up. I have printed good images that were taken at ISO 1600 from this camera but not all will work (the images were from a show in a dark bar, nearly pitch black with the usual colored lights in the back). I read somewhere in another Amazon review that they took better images with this camera than with their D300. That person needs to improve as a photographer or send back their D300 because it's faulty. I use a D300s and would never EVER pick this camera over my D300s if the option were available. Anyone who does a lot of post-production will find this camera useful, the pixels are flexible enough to get creative with.BIG Cons: slow to write and shoot. Even with a class 10 San Disk memory card it is a bit sluggish. Too bulky to put in your pocket unless you wear cargo pants/shorts. The MSRP is ridiculous, I waited til the price dropped below $350 but that's still kind of steep for a point and shoot.And last, the usual question: Canon or Nikon? If you are one of these people, just go with what feels comfortable with you. I use Nikon lenses, a Nikon D300s, and this little Nikon P7000. I recently helped my cousin buy a camera and she took the Canon G12. I supported her decision. Pick what feels right in your hand, play with the dials and menus and choose what feels 'normal.'

What I can say is that you can buy a P7000 and with a few clicks of the mouse, have a P7100.Nikon released a firmware update that corresponds with the enhanced features of the P7100, fixing all of the RAW writing problems. Another problem with editing images stems from the computer monitor, NOT the P7000. Spend $50 and have your monitor professionally calibrated by a dork. It makes a HUGE difference.One of the biggest issues with writing speed for the 10mb RAW files has to do with the memory card rather than the P7000. People will buy the biggest memory card they can for the lowest price without paying attention to the speed the memory can write. They also don't adjust file size for what they're doing.Example: if I'm shooting stills (macro, portraits, etc.), I'll shoot 10mb RAW+ files. I use class 10 memory, which means it needs to write at at least 10mb/sec. That means that because I'm using high quality class 10 memory that writes substantially faster, each massive (and beautiful) image I shoot writes in about 2/3 of a second.However, if I'm doing something that requires rapid fire, say at least 3 photos per second, I'll go down to a 5mb RAW only file. This gives me speed AND quality, but requires some editing in post.Between updating the firmware and learning what you're doing with \"film\" (in the old days, cheap film was known to be junk. Just because a camera is digital doesn't mean you don't have to spend for a quality recording media), you can have a camera that's just as good as the P7100 for much less.Face it: 2-5% of the people that buy this camera will actually use it to its full potential. That's why I'm inclined to believe that anyone bashing this camera doesn't know what they're doing and/or talking about.Also, without the movable screen, the P7000 is more reliable in the field because there's less the break.This is a great camera that does 98% of what a DSLR will do for 30% the price at 90% the quality that 99% of people won't even notice is 10% short.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Returned: 2-3 second write times for RAW is just unacceptable", "Author": "Bill L.

The P7000 turns on quick but at least in low light conditions it was 2-3 seconds before the images showed on the monitor. The Elph monitor seemed to show a much brighter picture in low light but the actual photo taken was nowhere close to that bright.

There are so many different kinds of people using cameras just a little bit about why I bought the P7000 and my photo background. I use to be a 35mm user and eventually was able to transition into DSLRs when they started to come down in price. We recently adopted our 14 month old daughter and I wanted something I could take with me more places, always have ready, had a large zoom range (didn't want to have to switch lenses when helping to keep track of little bit), and that recorded video. My DSLR is around 6 years old and does not record video.I wanted very good quality photos; crisp, vivid, well lit, and to have control when I wanted, auto when I had too much going on. The P7000 has more control options than most DSLRs. It also has met my desire for high quality photographs on auto and semi auto modes. It has passed the wow and the oooh test with flying colors when people see photos shot with it and say those photos look amazing.First the quality of still photos. I use the fine setting at 10meg which is the highest JPEG setting. This produces photos about 4.5 Megs in size. Good enough for an 11 by 14 poster and I would bet up to 16 by 20. But honestly out of tens of thousands of shots I have done a 16 by 20 poster once in my life. The auto setting produces very good photos. I most often use the P setting. With the P setting you have more control while the camera still chooses the aperture and shutter speed. But you can set the ISO, white balance, and also choose auto bracketing which is very easy and very cool. First you have three types of auto bracketing available, one is for shutter speed, the second is for ISO sensitivity, and the third for white balance. You can set the range of the bracketing and also how many shots you take. The default for instance is minus 1 to plus 1 with three shots. This is great for tricky light situations.The camera does take some getting use to. It comes with a 200 page manual. I found the best approach was to start shooting and then as I noticed options around the camera to start looking them up. The manual has a good index which is very helpful. For someone with a 35mm/ DSLR background this camera will be a lot of fun. So much more than just a regular point and shoot. So for stills I have been very pleased. I have gotten stunning shots of our daughter both inside and out.For video I have also been very pleased. Unlike some other high end point and shoot the P7000 you can zoom in and out when recording video. The zoom is perhaps not as good as higher end camcorders but pretty darn good. Just a very slight lag in focus but more than watchable on our 46 inch TV. I get 30 minutes of video with my existing 16 GB SDHC card so I will be investing in a 32 GB card shortly for vacations. Good video results indoors and very good video results outdoors. At first I was just going to keep my DSLR and go for a pocket camcorder. But I am glad I went this route. With an active child I simply do not always have time to use my DSLR. The 7x optical zoom range of the P7000s gives me high quality stills and video in a pocket camera (yes it does fit in my pocket but it is bigger than most point and shoots). But if you want a case I took a chance on the Lowepro Edit 130 Video Bag (Bordeaux Red) and it works well at a very reasonable price. The main compartment has a partition that gives the P7000 a snug fit with a few inches left over to the side. The front part is big enough to fit the charger. And it has a shoulder strap.The supplied software is called ViewNX 2. It actually has quite a lot of editing features. Speaking of editing features you can do a editing of JPEGs within the camera itself, there is a quick retouch feature that works pretty well. I haven't tried the RAW editing features within the camera itself but you have that as an option as well.Overall the P7000 produces some great pictures and video; rich true colors, vibrant, crisp details. I tried it on auto at first and it produced some amazing shots. So someone coming from a point and shoot background will be able to use this and be very pleased. There are a number of scene modes just like you would find on a simpler point and shoot that can be used. There is a fantastic macro close up mode that has produced, for me, better than my DSLR close-ups. For someone with a DSLR background there is more than most DSLR users could want or would ever use control and customizing features. Bottom-line for me I have wide angle to telephoto capability literally in my pocket for pictures and video.

This camera would get 5 stars plus from me...but...ran into the usual exclusiveness Nikon has promoted for decades and that reared its' ugly head with the EN-EL14 battery.  Apparently, if you load the firmware that fixes many of the problems Nikon had with this first venture into competing with Canon's G series cameras, you also uploaded into the camera the spyware Nikon incorporates to not allow you to use a reasonably priced battery.  That is why there are so many mixed reviews on whether the non Nikon battery works or not with various Nikon cameras.  I think they are doing themselves a disservice.  Anyone who thinks that 300 to 400 dollars for a dedicated flash needs to reconsider their qualitative values, and that goes for proprietary batteries as well.  That being said, the camera is truly great in performance.  Nikon has put together a combination of dials and switches on-board, plus very intuitive software (menus) that make the camera very usable.  The quality of pictures, really top notch.  I've read many of the reviews on Amazon and on dpreview.  One of the reasons I chose this camera was a CON listing on dpreview that stated this camera was a bit large and bulky.  Finally an advanced point and shoot camera that feels like a camera.  The viewfinder is kicked about by many.  True, it is not of the quality you would find on a Leica rangefinder camera from Germany.  It is a tunnel type finder, and that is what you get when you have a viewfinder with zoom capabilities versus fixed focal lengths.  As I've said in a couple other reviews, these things are very personal.  I cannot, after decades of looking through quality finders on ground glass, or rangefinder viewfinders, feel creative holding up a small television screen to my face which usually is almost impossible to see if you are outside.  A finder is absolutely necessary for me, and as lacking as this type of finder is, it is still a viewfinder.  I cannot look through the electronic type of finder and do anything creative either.  The video end is a bonus.  It allows zooming and auto exposure while recording high def video.  That will be a deal breaker for other cameras and by doing this, other companies will follow suit quickly...so thanks Nikon.  The 4 stars instead of 5 is for the battery debacle.  It is always justified by various companies as a protection to you the consumer that the warranty will not be compromised.  If the product is good, it will incorporate protection in the circuitry against surges, etc.  It all comes down to dollars in the end.

I was a Canon guy when I was familiar with their interface and now I'm a Nikon guy after learning their system.  I don't think the debate between the two is any more then that. Size,shape,function and build quality are very close between the two.The $500 cost of the G12 and P7000 is too high for these cameras compared to $700 for a Nikon D3100 or comparable DSLR so I purchased the Nikon because it was $100 less then the Canon thru Walmart.Face facts,this is not as fast as a camera that costs twice as much and is triple the size. I used to carry a Nikon F2 35mm and five lenses back in the 70's and gave up photography because of how intrusive that was.  Although,if you want to have more to play with I would get a DSLR and that would be good too.  The limitations are:  Low light performance, which is to be expected with this image sensor technologyso low light focusing can be a problem but can be worked around some by using the low light / low noise setting.  Aperture range is limited to f2.8 to f8 with widest setting and f5.6 to f8 at max telephoto setting.  This is a obvious limitation that you will need to live with.  The lens cover and lens assembly as a whole feels vulnerable and kinda cheap.I purchased a extra two years warranty from Walmart for $35. I would like to have a D3100 or d5100 DSLR and have inspected them at the store and those cameras also looked and felt plastic-y- so how much do you need to spend to get a higher quality piece of equipment?  The high points:  Overall beautiful pictures and OK video.  Function controls feel solid and there are plenty of manual controls to put you in control of the process.  Two control wheels to use - one for shutter speed and the other for aperture changes.  7x zoom which is better then the Canon.  Viewfinder shows less then finished photo but the image can be cropped later if you like.

I suppose you could remove them, but then that defeats the purpose of having the straps.2) In my limited experience, the write speeds were slow even using a Class 10 card. Shooting RAW was even worst.3) Zooming (in low light situations) while shooting video was terrible.  It would constantly get out of focus and took forever to bring things back to focus.  Additionally, the video would get progressively darker to the point where the screen was completely black.

My main camera is a Nikon D300 but I wanted a point-and-shoot for candid photos and for being able to capture shots that might be gone by the time I haul out the DSLR.The Coolpix S550 is simply not a good enough camera.  My wife uses the G10 and I've been impressed with it.It's amazing how similar the G10 and P7000 look.  For someone familiar with Nikon DSLRs, the menu system on the P7000 look very familiar.  The LCD display is much improved over the G10.  I think the controls layout is better on the P7000 than G10.For those who have noted problems, they probably need to do one of the following:1. Update the firmware in the camera2. Update Adobe Lightroom to version 3.3 or later and Photoshop CS5 to 12.0.3 or later3. Read the manualI thought macro mode was defective until I read the manual.  You need to zoom wide first.After an hour of playing, here's what I've found.I bought the flash attachment cover, but it comes with one.  I used the one I bought with my D300 which didn't have one.My initial photos taken in my office with subdued light have excellent focus and exposure.  Macro mode is amazing.I like the controls of the P7000 better than the G10.  They are very similar at first glance, but Quick Menu button is on the P7000 only.  Nice.  The G10 has LEDs next to control knobs, which is no better at all than the white dots on the P7000.  I'm not a fan of extraneous lights.  The exposure +/- index lights up when the setting is off zero, which is very intelligent.  The LCD display is brighter and clearer. The 7.1x zoom is better.  The zoom action of the camera seems excellent to me.The optical viewfinder is better than \"a hole in the camera\".  I am happy to have this feature for using it in bright light situations.  I realize that you only see 80% of what you are shooting, but that's fine.  Take your photo and crop later.I'll add more to this as I gain experience with the camera.*** Update 3/30 ***I continue to be surprised and impressed with how well engineered this camera is.  The review above mine complains about problems that are fixed with a firmware update.  Updating is easy.I bought the official Nikon P7000 case, which did not fit so I returned it thanks to Amazon.  I am happy with the Eagle Creek EC-40451 case.  It fits like a glove.  I replaced the neck strap with an Olympus 202315 Adjustable Wrist Strap.I think the color balance, focus, and exposure accuracy are amazing -- especially in low light.  There are a ton of features that are not typical of a point-and-shoot camera.  The inexpensive remote control works well.  My old Nikon S550 supposedly had vibration reduction, but it didn't seem to work.  It works quite well on the P7000.*** Update 4/28 ***I took this amazing camera on a 1-week photoshoot.  I loved the way the camera controls work.  The user interface engineering makes my D300 look clunky.  The macro mode is great, as is the movie mode.  Mostly, though, it is lightweight and I end up taking more photos than I would with just my DSLR.  The optical viewfinder is great in bright sunlight.  You'll end up with extra pixels that you can easily crop to your heart's delight later.  I shoot raw mode and did not notice being slowed down at all.  Make sure to install the firmware update.The P7000's macro mode will let you focus so close that the camera's shadow is the limiting factor.  The P7000 has hi-def video with image stabilization and allows zooming and refocusing while taking.This camera seemed very natural to me.  The only thing I'd change is I'd like for macro mode to reset when you cycle power.  I've taken a shot with macro mode mistakenly on, and it was NOT a disaster.  I still have a lot to learn about this great little camera but am very pleased with it.*** Update 6/24 ***I took the camera on a 2 1/2 week trip to Europe.  I also took my Nikon D300.  The P7000 worked so well that I found myself using the D300 only for its fish-eye lens.  I could whip out the camera, turn it on, and capture a shot in an amazingly short time.  I took a night shot at 1/5 second and it is tack sharp.  Quite a testimony for the anti-shake technology.  The P7000 gives me a lot higher yield for casual shooting than the D300, which cost 6x the price.The features and controls are easy to use and excellent.I cannot imagine a better point-and-shoot camera.*** Update 5/16/12 ***Continues to be an excellent camera.  It's a nice partner for the Nikon D7000.  I set up the User modes as follows:  U1 - Point and Shoot, U2 - Low Light, U3 - Macro Mode.  This makes it easy to have your settings standardized.

I've become accustomed to having precise control over my images, and being able to have wide latitude to edit them later with RAW files. When it came time to go overseas on vacation, I didn't want to lug a huge camera around with me. I wanted something I could fit in the side pocket of a backpack and have quick access to. However, I also didn't want to compromise on the control that I am used to having on my larger cameras. The list of suitable cameras ended up being pretty small.The lens on the P7000 is the equivalent to a 28-200 f/2.8-5.6 on a 35mm camera. This gives it a much broader zoom range than most point-and-shoot cameras. Low light performance is alright - better than my D50, not quite as good as my D3100. For indoor use, I keep it at ISO400 and generally have good results. The built-in flash illuminates subjects, but isn't a great fill-flash, and doesn't have a great range. However, when paired with a Nikon Speedlight like the Nikon SB-400, the camera is surprisingly capable and does exceedingly well.Detail resolution is great: even the smallest details resolve sharply when zoomed in to 100%. Lens distortion is minimal and easily fixed in Photoshop - CS5 and newer have a lens profile for this camera built-in. RAW files have the exposure latitude you'd expect, which is fantastic, especially when working with low-light photos.There is little to no shutter lag upon pressing the shutter release, however, it does take a few seconds (at least, depending on your chosen image size) until the camera can go on to the next photo. This might be the most frustrating thing about this camera, after becoming used to SLRs that can do multiple frames per second.Speaking of the controls on this camera, there are so many!

I prefer Canon because I have a 550D and 300HS, I also have a Panasonic LX3 which is getting really worn out but all take great pictures.  When I first looked for its replacement, I ordered the LX5 because the white is really nice.  I received the camera and was disappointed because the LCD showed inaccurate color and has a weird yellow tint.  It just felt cheap compared to LX3.  I returned it and decided on P7000 after choosing between many cameras like Canon G12, S95, and S100.  I'll admit I only bought the P7000 because of it's price.  I read many reviews and all mentioned it's slow speed but to me IMAGE QUALITY is the most important.  And also macro performance.  Ruled out S95 because its macro is 5cm and honestly I think it looks ugly and plain like any other p&s.;  S100 was my top choice for the wider angle(I've been spoiled by LX3's 24mm), with the f2.0 lens from S95 but instead of CCD it has CMOS sensor.  I preferred CMOS because noise is minimal to none and it's better for low light but I had to rule it out too because of it's price and similar look to S95.  You'd think that with the release of S100 the G12 would be cheaper but it isn't so for the sole factor of price I went with P7000 and frankly I'm not disappointed at all.  Everyone always goes for Canon and yes they're popular but certain models from other brands are just as good if not better.  After the 1.2 firmware update, the p7000 performs a lot better and I don't even mind that it's \"slower\" than Canon.  Image quality is excellent, sharp and detailed with wonderful depth of field.  I've yet to come across a noisy image, even at iso 800.  I know that if I went with S100, my images would look like watercolor instead of real images with clarity.  I guess it all boils down to preference, but I do not agree with anyone who says the P7000 under performs because it truly is an awesome camera that will surprise you.  It took a couple of days for me to familiarize myself with Nikon's menu interface but it wasn't difficult at all.  I am not a label whore so I don't find it necessary to stick to the same brand.  You'll be happy with the P7000 if you know what you're doing and understand the manual settings.one thing that I'm curious about is why when viewing pictures in playback, the image goes blurry at first.  this happens on some Sony cameras as well.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most excellent camera", "Author": "Stacey L.

It's very well suited for that. After an hour or two of reading the 200+ page manual that was included, I was able to learn most of the camera in a few hours of shooting in various conditions.Manual control of the aperture, shutter speed and other settings is extremely comprehensive and for the most part, quickly accessible. One negative in this regard is the ISO setting adjustment. It should get it's own dial, as it's a two to three step process.Some nice positives I'll note: The camera has a built in neutral density (ND) filter that does what it seems it's supposed to (provide long exposure shots in bright lighting and/or prevent washed out images from bright sunlight.) The zoom is quick, quiet and at 7x, quite nice. The battery lasts a long time and only takes an hour to charge.Also, and this was a big positive for me, it's significantly cheaper than it's main competitor, the Cannon G12, and produces what most agree are images of pretty much the same quality.Some complaints that I'll address:Failure to auto-focus. The auto-focus has worked 95% of the time for me, once I learned to set it between macro, infinity and auto appropriately. Very rarely it will focus on something closer than I want it to in auto.Slow writing of RAW images. Mine came with the 1.1 update, and I tried using it in RAW format.There's about a 2 second delay when writing. Otherwise, with JPG, the delay is not noticeable.Obscure menus and slow menu navigation. The only slow operation I've noticed so far is zooming in on an image while in playback. Otherwise, it's not bad. Adjusting the shutter speed and aperture is more clunky than it could be, but at least it's a one step process. It's not as snappy as my fiance's Canon DSLR, but close. Also, read the manual, it's a nice manual.So, overall, a great learning camera that takes pretty great pictures.

I looked at the Canon \"G\" also, as they make a nice product, but feel this was the better option.  It's nicer looking for one thing, has a bigger LCD - I really think the articluating one on the Canon is an unnecessary gimmick - you can zoom during movies; and the final image is slightly larger than what you see in the viewfinder, which is desirable, as you can always crop.  The Canon I found to be the opposite, with unwanted stuff showing up on the edges.  The aperture and wide angle were the same, but the Nikon zoom is longer, which was also desireable, and I thought the controls were better placed, I didn't have to resort to menus as much, and I really like the handy exposure control dial which lets you immediately see the effect before taking the picture.

Over on eBay, I saw a UV filter ([...]) that attached over the lens opening to act as a lens cover and completely protect the delicate parts. The stick-em is just around the outer edge and the filter seems firmly attached. While I got it for it's protective qualities, the UV filter aspect is a plus.The current firmware as of Dec. 2011 is Version 1.2 and is available as a download on the Nikon site though it has to be loaded off a memory card not over the USB cable.Belt holster cases..my first try was from Frys with an Ape Case AC 145.

The second case was also fabric from eBay and said Nikon on it...but my third is the best and a true keeper.

You have probably read how it's slow to write files to the card, or how the menus are hard to learn. Wow, they sure are. But you can learn them if you like a challenge.But here's the bottom line: This camera does some things others don't. Yes, it shoots excellent photographs as long as you don't go past ISO 400, but it's slow to use and bulky.So why will I keep this camera? two reasons:1. It shoots in interval mode. This means you can shoot a frame every 30 sec, 1, 5 or 10 minutes, until the card is full. But it's so hard to find out how to do it. I spent a lot of time figuring this out, here's how: You have first put the camera in U1 mode (top near center control) then you have to go to \"P\" menu and pick Continuous from the menu and you will see Interval Timer Shooting there. It won't work in any other mode, only the custom modes. But....VERY FEW CAMERAS DO THIS. Cheaper, junkier cameras sometimes do it like the optio series but this produces quality output.2. Auto 5 Stop Bracketing: Yup, no one else in this camera class does that either. Some cameras will shoot \"HDR\" but those are not adequate for serious work. This is excellent since you get 5 one spot-apart exposures and you can move those 5 stops anywhere on the exposure plane you want,excellent! I wish my Canon 5dMkII did that.That's it. There's no other reason I can tell to buy this camera. If you don't care about those two features, go get a Canon G12 if you want a huge pocket clunker or for those who want a smaller, super high quality camera get the Canon S95.

You will be more than happy with any of the other Nikon Coolpix set to point and shoot. If you want to grow into more professional photography, then the P7000 will amaze you. I have taken some of the most astonishing images that I have ever taken. It is very attractive, lightweight and has a nice retro rangefinder look and it is fun to use. The features are too numerous to mention but there is nothing left out but the big feature is the ability to shoot RAW and you have to decide if you wish to step up to that level of photography.

I want things to work as they are suppose to... bottom line. Sent it back to Nikon, I was told the whole shutter unit would be replaced under warranty.

I bet the company knew there was a problem and are not correcting the issue even as they pump out this camera. I got a full Refund for the P7000 and bought the Canon G12. Haven't looked back since.

It was a real clunker. Finally, I jumped with both feet, after excellent reviews, into the digital age with the D70s, then up to the D300s, my present workhorses for serious jobs/projects.Like everyone, you dream of a \"Kick-around\" camera to have when just doing daily chores or off relaxing, but not wanting to haul the heavy artillery. Hence the purchase of the Coolpix S210, it was ok but just barely.So, after reading the reviews, I was a little hesitant to purchase, (especially touch unseen over the internet) the Coolpix P7000.So now comes the Coolpix P7000 and in getting a good deal over the internet for under $400.00 and an extra battery for $ 27.00, I figured, why not.I have had it for a week and used it multiple times in a series of field tests and situations, all, I am pleased to say, with excellent results.First, it is a solid feeling camera with the exception of the lens ring which is a feature I would rather do without, not wanting to compromise the integrity of the inner workings in a harsh work environment.  If you are a Nikon user, you will be almost totally up to speed with this camera in a very short time, as most features follow the other Nikon cameras. The spin dial on the right side back is a new feature that I need to get used to it can go where you don't want to go.A lot has been said regarding the time for saving the image to the disc, I found in the non Raw mode, with the dial on any other setting but AUTO, and in the menu, set to continuous, this camera works fine on multiple shots in a burst up to 45 seconds.Low light shots inside or on the street with city lighting has gotten interesting and impressive results. The pop up flash is useless outside and after about 12 feet inside, but put a Nikon Speed light SB-800 on top and \"Oh, Man\", the results spank inside and outside!The HD movie setting seems to be decent for this camera although in low light situations are lacking but then see my disclaimer.The Macro is excellent, with results bordering on spectacular but suggest that it be used in manual mode in order to have full control of the depth of field issue.The telephoto lens is impressive during daylight usage but had minor issues in low light. I personally prefer not extending the telephoto lens into the digital Interpolation. The trade off isn't worth it in my opinion, with that said, it does have quite a reach for a point and shot format camera.The viewfinder is adequate, if you use it at all. First, it does cover the monitor, in other words, what you see in the viewfinder is what you see on the monitor. The back piece is like using a pinhole camera, if you ever made one, or using a pinhole rear sight on a 22.cal rifle. You have to get your eye right up to it and that usually means contact between the monitor and your nose!The monitor is large and generous in viewing, although bright sunlight can be an issue. I wish there was some type of protection on the screen, but an after product static film should help especially if the camera is keep in a coat pocket ( like I do) or cargo pocket in the Summer.I wish they would have PDF file of the manual which would make for a better search experience.The battery charger with a slide out plug makes for a great addition, no cords! Full charge is about a one and a half hour.Nikon ViewNX2 software: personally I have always found Nikon Software sadly lacking to the point where I don't even use it relying on other software to complete my photofinishing/ printing.I have to add a disclaimer, many reviews I read were comparing this camera with higher end products, I will say here that this is a FOUR hundred dollar camera, not a thousand dollar camera so for the money, it is a lot of bang for the buck, but at the end of the day, it is a FOUR hundred dollar camera.Price on Amazon was great and shipping cheap and fast, received it in three days.I would highly recommend this camera as long as you understand; it's a four hundred dollar camera.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great portable addition", "Author": "M.

There's so many options for taking photos- Compatible with Nikon flashes and remote accessories- The display is gorgeous!Cons:- May have a bit of a learning curve in understanding all the settings to make certain shots happen- The AF can be a bit off- The viewfinder is pretty narrow, but that's to be expected- Not a pocketable camera.

Indoors is still pretty darned good, too.  Keep in mind, this is a point & shoot camera, not a DSLR like a D300 or better.  But for trail hikes and anytime when compact, lightweight cameras are better than hauling a DSLR, this is a great camera.  There has been one \"sticking point,\"  plus a concern about control placement on the back of the cameraThe lens cover stoped retracting fully after the second month of shooting with it.  When powering up, the cover sticks half open and you have to gently use a finger nail to complete the opening function.  This is not a good sign from Nikon.  Since my cameras over the years have retained a pretty pristine appearance despite intense use on a recreational level, as well as on pro assignments, this seems to be a design flaw as noted by another reviewer.  I contacted Nikon about it and they responded within 24hrs with an apology and shipping information to get it repaired. Since I have been extremely happy with all of my Nikon cameras, lenses and the Coolscan 9000, as well as their service center, since 1970, I expect my P7000 back in my hands and ready to shoot in pretty short order.While the controls all function as instructed, there are too many controls too close to where your right thumb will be when shooting. It's just too easy to mistakenly push a control button.  I see this has been corrected on the new P7100 so it must have gathered a lot of criticism from other purchasers. Kudos to Nikon for paying attention to customer feedback. But black marks for faulty design in the first place.Again, the images are great, especially for a camera of this price.

Love my D90.  My wife has became a bit interested in photography and wanted her own camera to grow into, but smaller than an SLR.  My gut told me that she should just continue to use a point and shoot, but I figured I would look at some compacts with more manual settings.  Enter nikon P7000 - I considered this primarily because it has manual controls fairly accessible, and a hot shoe that she could use my SB600 for indoor use to shoot our baby as he is growing up - lets face it, without that flash, this camera in my dark house is just as good as a decent compact camera in auto mode.Anyway...its a nifty camera overall I feel, but with some annoyances from my perspective. And please recognize that \"my perspective\" is one coming from using my D90....Pros:1) smaller than an entry level DSLR, my wife likes its size very much2) hot shoe and iTTL - already have been using the sb600 a bit, not enought to tell you how the camera handles TTL metering....but I wish it was CLS compatible - can use my SB900 to trigger the 600 off camera, or get an SU800 or just use an SC-17 sync cord (dont have the cord or the su800).3) Monitor resolution is very good4) Like the exposure compensation knob5) Has a viewfinder6) Cant say too much about image quality yet, have only had it for a week or so, but so far it seems to shoot pretty nice casual photos7) focus speed is pretty good (it aint my D90 though :)Cons1) For indoor shooting, I frequently want to adjust ISO, shutter speed, and flash exposure compensation frequently....ISO and flash compensation are annoying to change in this camera (unless there are quicker ways to do it that I have yet to figure out - to change iso there is a multi-selector dial that you rotate to \"ISO\" - then hit the button, then it brings up a menuu, then you choose one of the auto ISO modes or a specific ISO....this process is very annoying to me personally.  Couple that with an even more annoying difficulty changing flash compensation - I use the same multiselector and rotate it to my custom menuu, and select it from that menu then change it. And the darn SB600 is not that easy to adjust flash compensation either.  The SB900 is much easier to adjust flash compensation, but its a mamouth on this P7000.  I wish there was a button dedicated for ISO and flash compensation to depress and rotate a dial to choose these, or have a dedicated dial for them.....Oh, and it appears that I cannot figure out how to see the ISO that is chosen within an auto ISO mode, I really like to know what ISO is being chosen when I push the shutter, not sure if I just havent figured out how to discplay it, but it appears that you have no option to see the ISO until you look at exif data later??2) The continuous focus mode for the P7000 is sorta weird, its called \"subject tracking\" - and you have to select it (which requires accessing a menu) - then choose your subject, then it tracks it...I havent used it very much yet, but it appears to be tedius and significantly less powerful than the SLR's same thing.I think this is a neat little camera...yes its a bit annoying to operate in low light - indoors with flash etc...but I am happy so far still with the choice to buy it.  If I had bought an SLR, then my wife would have been intimidated to use it I believe - I had teetered on just telling her to get a nice compact camera and keep it simple, but we already have one, and she isnt happy with the quality indoors shooting casual photos of our child (5months old and growing) - the P7000 teamed up with the SB600 or SB900 a basic dome diffuser or gary phong type of deal on it in P-auto and TTL flash will take some much higher quality shots indoors for what my wife wants it for, and she will have a nice little camera to grown into and learn the basics of photography....then she can inherit my D90 and I can get a full frame sensor :)For ME, I really do wish that this camera was easier to adjust ISO, see ISO, and easier to adjust flash compensation, then it would have gotten 4 stars or even 5 - but I really like the camera, recognizing its limitations anyway.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon user since 1983 (30 years)", "Author": "grandpa bill \"billyboy\"", "ReviewID": "RG7B78CA6AQQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned Nikon since they introduced the FA which had the BEST auto exposure system ever placed in a camera!

Being spoiled by 40 years of using Nikon, Pentax and Canon SLRs and DSLRs (And rangefinder) cameras, I chose the P7000 as much because it has one of the shortest \"lag\" times as for all the other great features. The lag time is the time between when you push the shutter button and the moment when it has finished focusing and actually actuates the shutter. All P&S; cameras have long lag times. The P7000 was on the list as one of the shortest on the market.For long periods, the P7000 has set on the shelf while I carried my various Nikon DSLRs around.

Since then, I have shot over 2,000 images. I still have occasional problems but those are not caused by the camera. They are operator error. The convenience of this light-weight camera which will do most of what my DSLRs do is appreciated. With the big cameras, I usually have to bring along 3-4 lenses to cover the same range as the P7000. This means a camera backpack.Naturally there is a downside. I can't blow up my P7000 images to 30x36 without straining even Genuine Fractals--well I could but there is some deterioration above 8x10--but I don't do that very often anyway.

It was small enough that I can put it on my Camelback. Its a perfect small camera I can bring with me to social occasions without looking like a dork but still be able to take clean photos. But after reading many reviews for a week, I narrowed down the drawbacks of getting this camera: crappy focus, slow at writing raw, menus are sluggish, the front lens cover thingy craps out, blown highlights, and that the optical viewfinder sucks.But despite of all of these drawbacks, I decided to get it anyways. It has a hot shoe where I can attach my SB600. And the photos on Flickr by other P7000 owners looked good. And the owners seemed to love the camera despite its crappiness. I figured I can live with the drawbacks (except the lens cap thingy), considering this camera is a pretty good deal for $260 new.So after receiving the camera two days later, I popped the battery in and tried to play with it. Guess what, all of the reviews were right with the exception of the front lens cap thingy crapping out. I tried focusing on a blade of grass, the camera wouldn't autofocus. I tried taking a picture of a flower in harsh lighting, blown highlights even with -1 exposure comp. After an hour with it, I wanted to return the camera back. But I really like how the camera is, so I gave it another day after I upgraded the firmware to 1.2.After the firmware upgrade, the P7000 is like a different camera. The menus and the raw write times are a tad bit faster but not too much. The most important one I think was the autofocus, it doesn't crap out as much. Five days later, I decided to keep the camera. This camera is OK. I repeat, just OK. If you can live with the slow menus, slow write speed, and the occasional blown highlights, then this camera will be fine. Its not too bad.For the time I've had this camera, I have gotten really good shots I would have otherwise missed because I didn't have a DSLR with me. This camera provides DSLR control at a small package. This camera comes wherever I go. Remember folks, its not about the camera. Its the eye behind the camera. This P7000 is just a tool. It may have its quirks, but it is still capable of taking good quality photos. I wouldn't give this camera a full recommendation but rather a conditional one. Consider the caveats, but also consider the good value (after the firmware upgrade). Would you rather dig through menus to get the setting you want or have it right on the camera itself? If you pick the first one, then this camera is not for you. If you pick the second on, well consider this camera. Its fun to shoot with once you get the hang of it.I would have given this four stars. I can live with the laggy menu, the occasional autofocus hunting, and the slow write times. Its the highlights. You can't recover details in blown highlights. I rarely do post processing, but trying to fix a blown highlight is a pain with just View NX and Picasa. But I still like this camera.2 Months Later:I still like the camera, my D5000 is getting dusty because of its portability. But by no means its able to replace or match my DSLR. The sluggishness of camera gets annoying, I missed a bunch of shots because of it. The video though is fun to use, the mic is good enough where it doesn't blow out sounds. I used it once to record a band while the camera is on top of their speakers. Sound quality is acceptable. My D5000 cant match that.I hate the tendency of this camera to blow out highlights.I'll still give it three stars though.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Joonki Kim", "ReviewID": "R1IUVR7YUX99X4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.

The P7000 is a little larger than I would like, but its capability is up there with the best and it seems the more capable the unit is, the larger it will probably be.You can be creative to your heart's content and beyond as it allows you the opportunity to make most critical adjustments without going into the menus.  For the point and shoot crowd, the Auto Mode is exceptional. It is one of the few cameras that let you venture into the creative area while in Auto by letting you adjust the exposure compensation. This is a good place to start for those wanting to venture off the beaten track.A camera is but a tool, and all tools have limitations, depending upon its intended use. There are areas where this camera could be better, but the final output in image quality is superb. None of the professional reviews that I read have said otherwise.The video is also very good, as it attested to in many reviews. There is zoom and continuous focus available, although when in continuous focus, the focus noise may be heard if in a quiet setting. My personal preference is to leave it in the normal focus position, or in the infinity focus position. You will still be able to zoom a little and keep things in focus. This is not a camcorder, but will serve the purpose for those memorable times when video is desired.There is no sense getting into the pros and cons or the detail of what the P7000 can do better or not than its competitors. There are many reviews available for that, although it will be difficult to wade through others opinions to determine the actual facts you are looking for.My suggestion for the most accurate specifications is the Nikon website.

The optical viewfinder is marginal at best compared with my Leica M 6/7/and 9's but what do you expect considering the price difference? It's good enough. Picture quality is also good enough too.Like many, far too many, digital cameras the menu options are way too long, however if you just set it up to shoot RAW in P for Programme the camera does very well. It's what it is, a really good \"carry around\" camera that will serve you well for 85% of casual photographic needs..........Build quality is good too apart from the following issue:I do have one very big gripe, and this is directed to Nikon itself of whom I've been a customer of their professional photographic products for nearly four decades. I bought this camera through Amazon for my present sojourn and work in France, but a week or so after arriving here the camera developed a problem with the lens covers/blinds not opening properly. Sadly this isn't a rare occurrence, check it out on the WWW. So as the camera was under warranty, I bought it December 29th 2010, I contacted Nikon France to see if I could get it repaired. No response at all from them to several emails and calls/messages left with \"customer service\". Then I contacted Nikon UK thinking that it would be easier to get it repaired there, well it wasn't. Basically Nikon told me that as I bought the camera in the US it couldn't be repaired under warranty anywhere other than the US, Nikon UK refused to help out in anyway at all.I will not be returning to the US until June and sending the camera to the US Nikon repair facility would take a long time meaning I would not have it here to use at all. So I've opted to live with the issue and just check every time the camera's turned on that the lens curtain is open fully.Amazon were great, they offered to refund the sale in full if I could return everything that came with the camera, that I couldn't do because I don't have everything here with me in France. So they refunded me a decent portion of the cost of the camera by way of compensation.......Thank you Amazon, great service as always and an example why I use the company as my main purchasing source for pretty much everything I can.Nikon take note of this standard of service.....but obviously they don't really care otherwise this camera would have been fixed for me in Europe by now.So, to sum up....apart from my gripe with Nikon, this camera is a very good photographic tool.

The automatic lens cover sticks in the 1/2 way closed position and must be manually opened. If we forget to check and make sure it's opened, our photos are ruined. This is a big negative as manually opening it puts the lens at risk if you make contact with your finger. To have it repaired will cost about $100, making this $400 investment in a what we thought was a quality digital point & shoot a mistake.  And based on the original poor performance of the lens cover, we would expect it to fail soon after the repair with no warranty.The second complaint - We like to shoot using the viewfinder rather than the display, especially in bright sunlight. This was a significant factor in choosing this model. Using the viewfinder also is easier on battery life. However, when using the viewfinder the display screen on back of the camera does not display the photo after shooting as our Nikon D70s does. With the Coolpix P7000 one has to turn on the screen after each photo to see the pic.  This is a big battery drainer and extra step, which shoudn't be necessary in this costly a camera.After a little over a year with this camera we regret to advise against it. At about $400 it is WAY OVERPRICED especially given the poor customer service and abandonment by Nikon in the face of the lens cover defect.

I wanted a little point and shoot that I could carry with me wherever I go that had a RAW capability. After a lot of research and study I chose the P7000. It fills the bill.When I first switched to digital I had a Nikon F5 and I was't sure about this digital revolution so I bought a Nikon Coolpix 8800. Because of this I knew that I had to deal with shutter lag and slower write speeds if I wanted a point and shoot. If I'm shooting action of any kind or if I need my longer lens it's back to the D200 but the P7000 is great for most other situations. I still hate the shutter lag and write time challenges but I love the portability and quiet. The only other small disappointment with this camera is that the viewfinder is fixed. The articulating screen on the 8800 was one of my favorite features I miss it on the P7000.There is a great review of the P7000 on this site by Robert C. and I recommend you look at his pros and cons listing.

It's every bit as fast as a camera from 1998. Its sole advantage is that it takes 10MP RAW photos.Of course, it takes five seconds to save those photos.My last compact camera was a Canon G10, which I sold because the image quality from its 14MP sensor was very noisy, and it wasn't quite as fast as a DSLR to focus and take a snapshot. I thought the P7000 would be faster and better. But it's not.The Canon was almost all metal, and felt more solid. Despite being two years older than the P7000, it was faster. Faster to respond both to user input and to lighting and focus changes.

I shoot only RAW, and the write speed is very slow with those big files, a bit slower than the G-12 Canon. Focusing is a bit quicker than the Canon, but still slower than a DSLR.

I am not very interested in video, but the results blew me away. For someone just getting into digital photography, you may want to get a simpler, less expensive camera.

Nikon no longer sells its parts to independent consumers or to independent camera dealers.  If, for example, you drop your camera and damage the LCD screen, you will not be able to purchase a replacement screen to fix the camera yourself nor will you be able to work with a reputable camera dealer in your area.  If a Nikon camera needs repair, it must be shipped to the Nikon Repair Center.  This policy holds the consumer hostage as the cost of shipping, parts, and unnecessary labor will come close to the cost of a brand new camera.  If you are capable of making your own repairs or if you have a reputable camera dealer in your area, do not buy Nikon.

To keep the peace, it was high time to outfit the rest of us with something to keep us busy, so I bought a Canon S95 for the kids (teenagers) to share and this P7000 for me.  I was excited about this camera; it seemed like the perfect compromise between my wife's heavy DSLR and the kids' pocket sized point and shoot.  Loved all the dials to avoid digging around through menus to make shot adjustments.And off we went to Egypt.I ended up being fairly annoyed with the P7000.  Many have mentioned the sticky lens cover, and you ignore this issue at your peril.  It WILL happen to you.  By the second day it was sticking every time I opened it, forcing me to flick it open with my finger, smudging the lens or trying hard not to, over and over and over.  Maybe I can take it in for an adjustment, but it didn't help with this trip.  And it was brand new.Like others, I found the camera to be much slower than the DSLR, but in ways that did make me miss shots.  I can handle it taking a little longer to focus or to meter, but when i would try to zoom in, the zoom would not even move until the camera had focussed and metered at the current focal length.  Then the zoom would work, and it would have to focus and meter all over again for the new one.  Not just slower, but you have to do it twice.  It was frustrating, and I missed a lot of shots this way.And all those nifty dials?  Cool and old school in a way, but also easy to turn inadvertantly.  What, you didn't want +2 on your exposure?  I'm sorry, I thought you did.  Erg.  I ended up much preferring the more responsive S95 (kids, Can I borrow that?), and I am not a Canon guy!  Yes, it is harder to use screen menus to make adjustments, but most of the adjustments can be made in Photshop after the fact anyway, and I ended up having to fix a lot of P7000 in photoshop too.On the plus side, it does take lovely pictures, the \"scenes\" are very convenient presets and really improve both the pictures and the speed to take them, the zoom range is very nice, and the low light capability excellent.Still, overall, too annoying for me, and this one will soon be up on ebay.

It's not up to par with entry level dslr's, but very close. Color saturation is great, noise levels are very good, low light performance is excellent, clarity is exceptional. I've had this camera for several years now and it still holds a soft spot in my heart. I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a point and shoot camera. As a photographer, I am difficult to please when it comes to cameras, particularly when it comes to point and shoot cameras. Prior to buying this camera, I tried 2 canon point and shoots (G2 and ixus), a fuji point and shoot, and a more compact nikon point and shoot. All of them went back to the store and we decided to spend the extra $100 and buy this camera. This camera is more expensive than the average point and shoot, but it is THE BEST! We bought it in 2011 and 2 years later still love it and do not feel the need to replace it with a newer camera.Pros:Excellent picture qualityPop-up flash, which is better than directly on camera. The further your flash is from the lens, the better.Ae-AF lock if needed.Ability to be used entirely under manual control. You can adjust the shutter, iso, f stop, white balance, etc all independently of each other.Shoots videoSturdy and tough encasementSmall enough that you can take it on outings where you don't want to have to tote a big dslr, but still get great picture quality.You can put an adapter on it and add alternate lenses if you want.Has a shoe for adding a flash.Has a view finder as well as live view.Color saturation is remarkable.Auto white balance is impressive, especially with balancing correctly under household lights.Battery life is very long.Can be mounted on a tripod.Cons:Not as fast as a DSLR but it's not very noticeable unless you're shooting sports. I have no problem using this camera to photograph fast moving children.On button is next to the shutter release. I sometimes accidentally turn it off, but it's rare.Battery does not indicate how much charge you have left until it's low. It'll display a half battery when it's getting low, but if you turn on the camera and want to see how much charge there is to assess if you need to charge it before leaving to use it, there's no way to know if it has 99% vs. 30% left. It only displays the battery icon when it's getting really low.All in all, I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a point and shoot. If you want dslr-like quality but don't want to spent the additional money to get a dslr, or if you want dslr-like quality but don't like how big dslr's are, this is the camera for you.

Williams", "ReviewID": "RCAWJ960KFW9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera really gets a bad rap.  I bought this camera just for snapshots when it's inconvenient to lug around my DSLR.  Mostly because I got it on Ebay for $100 with under 2,000 clicks, and I thought I could at least sell it for what I paid for it if I hated it.  I DON'T hate it. It doesn't compare with the IQ or speed of a DSLR, but that's also not what it was made for.  When I bought it, it already had the newest firmware installed, so I can't comment on speed with older firmware versions, but it is plenty fast for what I need it for.  I have shot in RAW + JPEG & JPEG Fine modes, and I have no problem with write times.  I did do some night shooting with the noise reduction on, and it took a couple of seconds, but it didn't matter to me.  I was shooting night snow shots, not a soccer game.  The other big speed complaint I have heard is the menus.  While I am not a big fan of the way the menus are set up, I have no big issue with the speed. Once you get used to the menu format, it's not that bad, but it could have been more user friendly.  Menus is the main reason it gets a 4 instead of 5.  I was not extremely happy with my night shots, but I did them a week after getting the camera, so I was mostly experimenting with the high iso and VR at slow shutter speeds handholding it. I'm sure it would have been better with longer exposures and lower iso on a tripod. To be fair, I had not really learned how to use this camera yet.  Daytime shots are fantastic.  I did some museum shooting last weekend, and was very pleased with the results. If you want to shoot RAW all the time, and need immediate downloads, this camera is probably not for you.  If, however, you are looking for a great P&S; that also gives you manual control, and is more than speedy enough for single frame shooting, I highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon coolpix p7000", "Author": "Lanette Scantlin", "ReviewID": "R19G4MZSHOOU3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing!

It is a REALLY great point and shoot, and is flat out the best you can buy for $249, new with full warranty. If you know how to use a camera properly (which few people really do) you can get this little box to do amazing things for you. Like the G12, it has a fixed lens that it is built around--and both of these cameras have outstanding lenses. The longer zoom on the P7000 will give you more reach and greater compositional flexibility over the G12, but I find the G12's zoom range to be fully acceptable most of the time.Honestly, I don't even use the G12 anymore because of my new love: Canon's scintillating pocket wonder, the S95, now succeeded by the newer and just as small S100. The S95 has the same sensor and guts as the G12, but with a better (faster) lens. No, it doesn't zoom as far as the G12--not NEARLY as far as this Nikon.But it has almost all the control of those cameras--most of it available via physical dials rather than drilling down a bunch of menus. So like the P7000 or the G12, I can get the shot instead of fiddling with the camera.You can do the same with this wonderful Nikon--plus it has a nifty WB mode right on the top dial. For low-light shooting this is a really nice feature. I usually just point the S95 at my white shirt and hit the auto calibrate and then shoot away. The S95's party trick is its f/2.0 lens. It is much better in low light than the G12 or the Nikon--provided you don't want to use zoom. Combined with its tiny size, you have a cam that is capable of major league shots but fits in a shirt pocket.Of course, today only, the P7000 is a hundred fifty bucks less than the S95. Get it while it's hot. If you are just thinking about learning to use a camera correctly but couldn't afford to get one that would let you come a long way as you learn without feeling the need for an upgrade, here's your camera, boys and girls.I still prefer the G12. It does everything a bit quicker, has more tactile controls so you can get the shot faster, and the controls are more logically laid out than the P7000. The articulating screen and stereo mics are nice for video as well.But the P7000 has that longer zoom and a nicer shutter button, and it's not slow by any means. If you can get a still image with the G12, you can pretty much get that shot with the P7000. For very cheap today only!I cannot say enough good about this camera. If you are an aspiring photog on a budget, this camera will get you shots you cannot touch with any other Nikon Coolpix camera. It is simply the top of the Coolpix line. It will get you better shots than any Canon point and shoot save the G12, S95 and S100, which all rival it in some ways, come close in others, and beat it in still others.Ansel Adams used to say the most important component of the camera is the 12 inches behind the viewfinder. He wasn't just talking about knowing the relationship between light and your camera, knowing how your lens affects the image it 'sees,' knowing the dance between aperture, shutter speed and ambient light or the artistic eye of the photographer that spots good images in all the things we see around us. It's all of that. You can develop your artistic eye even if you have a cheap old 5 megapixel Coolpix (my very first digital camera was one). You can develop your knowledge of aperture and shutter parameters as you go, but even now if you're a full auto shooter you can take stunning photos if you just know what to point the camera at and how to frame it.Truly what camera you have doesn't matter if you develop this part of your skill. The rest of the skills--the manipulation of light through lens settings and filters, post processing of all kinds--will come with learning and practice. I'm here to tell you that you can take great shots with whatever camera you have now. But if you have $249 to spend this machine will let you expand your other photographic skills to quite an advanced level as you're learning to develop your artistic eye.I'm not popping the $249 because I'm happy with the point and shoots I have. I'm even considering selling the G12 because of my rapidly increasing confidence that I can get the shot with my S95. The one thing I don't have with the S95 that the G12 gives me is a built-in ND filter. What a lifesaver in bright daylight. It allows you to slow down your shot and push your histogram significantly to the right without blowing out the highlights. Well guess what, kiddies: the P7000 has a built-in ND filter too. In general, if you're daylight shooting in full sunlight, that ND filter should be switched \"on.\" It allows you to \"slow down\" your shots. Even in a shady forest you can use the ND filter to slow your shot of a waterfall on a brook to get those neat cotton-candy waterfall effects. Just make sure to lock the camera down to keep the rest of the image sharp.There are so many good reasons to get this camera, even at its normal advertised price.

For some time I had been looking to upgrade my old Sony Cybershot and finaly dropped on the Nikon P7000. I had messed with this and a number of other cameras in a local shop but was pretty hung up on some of the negative and mixed reviews I'd read on this model, overall I was very pleasantly surprised. Here are a few of my observations, good and bad:Good:-Exceptional lens, many 3rd party applications are available for additional lens and filters.-JPEG Quality is great especially @ fine quality, RAW quality could probably be better though.-very good built in flash with goo control options and works flawlessly with ittl units as a bonus.-Huge range of versatility in terms of controls and features. I've shot lots of landscapes and architecture, as well as a wedding using this camera with outstanding results.Bad:-Focus is a little whacky, even after the December '11 firmware update. At times the af selects the strangest things to focus on, and focus speed is a little slow. Overall these issues are rarely problems for me though.-ISO performance above 1600 is generally rather noisy, depending on subject, lighting, and colors.-RAW performance is definitely not as good as even an older DSLR, and comes with sluggish operating speed.-User friendliness is by far the worst mark for the Nikon P7000 in my book. The menus and navigation are very awkward at first.Construction quality feels really solid. Thanks to is size and bulk, two hands are generally better than one, and you can forget about sticking it in your pocket. Battery performance feels acceptable, I shot about 320 pictures @ my cousin's wedding before the battery went critical, I used flash about40-60% of that time. Under casual use a charge lasts a few days for me, but I am a rather heavy user.  It would be nice if the screen swiveled and/or tilted, and the veiwfinder isn't horribly functional, and 10.1mp sounds small at first but for less than $250 this is a very good, very versatile compact camera capable of delivering exceptional quality pictures.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than Canon G12", "Author": "K.

When my Canon G9 failed I decided to switch to Nikon.  Here is what I like better about the Nikon than the Canon line:1.)  The hot shoe on the Nikon is standard size and not some joker manufacturer specific size.  That works out nice if you have an external microphone you want to use that is not a Canon microphone.2.)  The Nikon has an external microphone audio input.  Basically on the Canon you are stuck if you want to use any kind of sound device other that the Canon microphone.  Like for example when you need to have the shotgun microphone pointed in another direction so you don't want it mounted on the top of the camera or when using a lavalier microphone.3.)  I find that the Nikon takes better photos and video both.I am just tired of reading where the Canon Gxxx is better than the Nikon.  I think the Nikon ranks 5 star compared with about 3 star for the Canon line.Just as a side note; used this camera for 3 months and it was in a gear bag that dropped into the ocean (near the shore) and the gear bag failed.  The camera was exposed to a slight amount of salt water and it was unfortunately fried.  I am sure if it was fresh water it would have been fine.  Obviously not the fault of the camera as any salt water will destroy any electronics very quickly.

Microphone mic plugged into it. The complex lighting here completely threw off the camera, resulting in the dim interior and the greenish-yellow hue in the outside scene. I've filmed here before using a Kodak Zi8 with much cleaner results. The results with the Sony mic are also not so good: there is a sharp fallout at the bass frequencies below 250 Hz, and loud sound volumes cause distortion. The same Sony mic used with a Zi8 produces more even results and can handle much greater sound volumes (club shows and such.) The Sony does have a higher upper frequency range when used with the P7000: peaking out at nearly 18,000 Hz as opposed to 15,000 when used with the Zi8. So for video use, the P7000 is best in well-lit scenes with moderate to low sound volumes, but you will need to do some video and audio editing regardless to maximize your results.Other points: if you use the zoom while filming, you will go out of focus unless the P7000 is set to Full Time Autofocus, as opposed to a one time focus by pressing the shutter-release button down midway; you can expect to get about 30 minutes of video from the battery; files are saved in a H.264-compressed Quicktime MOV format; I got a curious visual hiccup when first I first used it -- Nikon tech support thought my SD card wasn't fast enough, but I was using a Class 10 Adata SDHC card; this is the only midrange compact camera as of this writing with an external mic and using H.264 compression -- both very necessary for decent video shooting; and my experience with Nikon's tech support was so-so -- I had to repeat my questions and explain my issues a bit more than I should have.As far as using it for its intended purpose of taking photos, the few outdoor shots I've taken were outstanding, while the indoor, low light shots were hit or miss: there is a specific mode for low light shooting that either works great or not so much.I very nearly returned this since its video performance wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped, but I did need a good new photo camera and this does work rather well as a video camera in quieter, better lit environments. Bundled with a compact stereo mic like the Sony ECM-DS70P (plus a right angle 3.5 mm adapter to orient it properly), it does appear to function better as an all-purpose video/photo camera than anything else in its general price range.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Practical", "Author": "Martha B.", "ReviewID": "RWYYPZEWWH8AR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just a simple review I'm a professional photographer using a D3 for work.

Simply put, it has a very difficult time acquiring focus in low light and low contrast situations. When I say low light, I do not mean pitch black. For example, I took the camera to a wedding where the light was a mixture of artificial lighting and indirect sunlight coming from numerous windows. Most of the pictures were out of focus.In contrast, I took a Canon G10 on a vacation where I took approx. 800 photos. Over 100 of which were in low light settings. I had very few focus issues.

And does it have tricks and quirks?  Sure!  It's slow to turn on, overexposes a bit too often (especially in challenging situations like sunsets), it's very limited in its ISO performance, and the results are simply unexpected at times (the same situation, same light, same composition, yields a different photograph when used in A and P modes).However, I must add that the high speed lens does not disappoint anyone, and that the image quality in terms of sharpness and size is nothing to sneeze at.  And the zoom, while not of constant aperture, is kinda respectable (from wide to tele, that is 28mm to 200mm in film format).  What was I expecting, SLR performance in a P&S; package?  That's not going to happen... but at least, once you get used to HAVING to chimp (the very thing I wanted to avoid), framing and composing aren't too bad.  One more reason I purchased this camera was the real viewfinder... which turned out to be just symbolic.  Parallax problems abound!  Again, given that this is a limited camera and a very poor substitute for a full-fledged SLR, the overall results weren't too bad.  For a while I considered reselling it and buying a dSLR like a Nikon D40 or a D7000, but then, the pocketability of this camera just saved it.Hence, for those interested: it's NOT like an SLR.  It's a very P&S; camera, with a number of potential hickups and quirks.  I got used to the kind of slow start and slow image recording (and I'm glad I didn't go for using RAW), but then, despite its limitations, the zoom lens, the video feature, the performance under fairly even light and its size managed to ensure that I won't sell it.

Returned it today. Sorry Nikon - I really wanted to keep this one.Pros:Good IQ for a P&S;Innovate controls; well thought outGreat LCDExcellent focal rangeCons:Slow zoom in/out speed; lag time before lens moves in or outSlow write times to SD card when shooting RAW more than 1 second; Camera is non-functional during this period.Noticeable shutter lagLess than 100% optical viewfinderHas trouble focusing in low lightOverexposes intermittently without apparent reasonI am afraid an entry level DSLR is a better choice: Not much bigger, no shutter lag and ability to take second picture while writing to SD card.** Update after seeing other reviews and reading feedback **My concern about flash card write times exists with both JPGs and RAW files. Writing simply takes longer with RAW files. The P7000 locks up and will not perform any functions until writing is complete. In JPG mode, the lockup is about 1 second using a Class 10 SDHC card.  It is about 2 seconds for RAW images.  Even the most inexpensive DLSR will buffer its write operations so the next picture can be taken more or less immediately.  This continues until the physical buffer is full - usually from 5 to 100 shots. When you read reviews from other people, they claim the P7000 is a good DSLR replacement. Without this fundamental feature, I don't see how they can say this.My concern about the zoom remains: there a lag time before the lens actually moves. It takes about 500 milliseconds for the lens to move after touching the zoom lever for the first time. After that, it performs well.My summary: The P7000 is a fine landscape camera. If I did much of that, I would buy a P7000 to augment my other cameras. It is not really suitable for action or people photography where many images must to be taken to capture the right moment.I have given up on this class of camera since I understand both the Canon G12 and Lumix LX5 suffer from the same write time malady. I have purchased the pocket sized Canon s95 as a carry-around camera. It locks up while writing too.  But since it fits in my pocket, I will accept this limitation for now.

Anxiously awaiting this incredibly useful feature to be re-introduced in the Nikon P8000.  Nikon made the mistake of ending the versatile articulating display in this type of camera back with the Nikon Coolpix 5000 and finally the Coolpix 5400.They made the huge mistake of shrinking the display size with the 5400 while all other manufacturers increased their displays for better viewing and better sales.  Great camera but found myself constantly squinting to see my pics on the tiny screen.After Nikon degraded this series by removing the articulating display feature I was forced to switch to the Canon G series.  The Canon G6 had articulating display, IR remote control, and external flash capability!  All deal closers.Then Canon also made the huge mistake of degrading following generations by removing the articulating display and getting rid of the IR remote capability.  Ouch!  There was nothing in this class to choose from for years ... but with the introduction of the Canon G11 the useful articulating display was back! Still no IR remote but a step back in the right direction.  Got around that by plugging in a external RF remote accessory.Now I can see what I'm shooting again for trick shots from the back and front and over and under the camera; even from the side!  Come on Nikon.  Where is your articulating display?If you read these reviews you can easily see that a lot of consumers bought this Nikon over the Canon G because of its longer range zoom, but a lot of consumers also bought the Canon G over this Nikon because of its Articulating Display.The Nikon already has built in IR remote capability with IR sensors on both front and rear of the camera.  Great for tripod night shots from behind, and the front is great for a sequence of remote control shots with your family ... except that you can't see where you are in the photo because there is no articulating display facing you. :^(Come on Nikon, where is the missing articulating display that is causing you to give sales to Canon?I love my Nikon DSLRs!  Nikon, if and when you finally re-introduce the incredibly versatile Articulating Display on this series please let me know so I can switch back to Nikon.

One might as well forget the user's manual as it is so poorly written and organized it is not of much help at all. There is very little information, if any at all, on how settings function, how to adjust them and what they do even though the manual is over 200 pages. The index listings do not direct one to useful information such as how the ND filter adjustments are made, why the exposure mode setting in \"My Menu\" are locked out and can not be selected, how the \"Function\" button adjusts the ND filter, ISO or other options, etc. The manual itself is so poorly organized that most of the time when a user finds a topic one is looking for, the manual lists other pages where other bits and pieces are scattered throughout w/o an answer other than adjustments can be made. Yeah, but how????I tried to find a manual for the P7000 on Nikon's website, but the manual is not available for download or viewing. Hmmmmm, interesting. The Q&A; section on the Nikon product support page lists the P7000 manual as being available on Nikon USA's web page since 9/24/2010. It's driving me nuts trying to find answers to operational questions. I guess I should stay with my D700's and D90 cameras and for get the \"less technical\" CoolPix P7000. At least the DLSR's manuals are more complete and the operation's answers are not so confoundedly hard to find.Other than the frustration, the P7000 movie mode seems to work well for such a small camera and the pictures are not bad at all from the small view finder. I have not loaded any frames onto the computer yet to try Capture NX 2's ability to decipher the NRW format yet. So beware. Searching for answers will take more time than I could have imagined.10/5/2010After many hours of trying to read the manual to figure out some of the P7000's feature, I finally determined one main reason for the trouble using the manual was the improper English grammar used to explain features and functions. Several important verbs and adverbs are completely wrong and caused my confusion, e.g. the manual states,\" light that enters the camera while shooting can be reduced in three steps\". The ND filter does not reduce light in three steps (which caused me to search high and low to find the procedure to use the three steps), but instead, it reduces light \"BY\" three steps or stops. Once I discovered this English grammar error, I noticed several more throughout the manual. One has to adjust one's English understanding to understand this poorly organized manual.The camera itself seems to very capable and certainly has very high potential. Nikon needs to employ a native English speaker to write their English section of the manual. I can image the errors in the other manual's languages.

Sucessessor to the P6000 from last year, the P7000 improves upon an already impressive competitor to the G11/G12. What I like about the Coolpix P7000 isn't the good glass that Nikon uses (its great) at a 28-200mm 35mm equivalent, advanced manual controls for the DSLR advanced user. Its the fact that it has a jack for an external stereo Mic that compliments its 720P 24fps HD video. It drives me crazy that Canon didn't include that feature in the G12, which was on my own personal target list.  Other than that, the two cameras are comparable. The P7000 is perfect as a second camera for Nikon shooters, where the G12 is a perfect compliment for Canon shooters. Thank goodness for completion amongst the industry leaders!
