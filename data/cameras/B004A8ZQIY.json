On our family trip to Europe recently, I took the GF2 with the 14mm pancake lens only. The camera focuses fast with virtually no shutter lag. Exposure was very good, better than my SLR. The 28mm equivalent lens was very good for all the family pictures, landscapes and all the sights. The HD movie mode was also very useful as it's activated by a dedicated button. I took over a thousand pictures on this trip and dozens of short videos, and my 32 GB SDHC card was not even half full. I highly recommend this camera. It is compact enough to fit into my coat pocket, which is another reason I chose the pancake lens rather than the zoom lens. Picture quality seems to be similar to my SLR with similar low light capability. ISO 800 was very usable.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Portable and producing good photos", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2JEZW65WA9ENF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is light, small, and very portable. The 14mm/f2.5 pancake lens is excellent. The camera with the 14mm lens and the 14-42mm lens (I got with another Pany) produces good photos. I dropped my old point&shoot.;", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another Great Panasonic Lumix Camera", "Author": "Ralph Lamonda", "ReviewID": "R3HXW1PUTUAYAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as  birthday gift for my adult daughter.
