I bought Duracell rechargeables with the camera, told my camera that these were the batteries I was using through its menu system, and have been taking pictures for a week on the same batteries. That's more than 80 pictures -- perhaps more -- all on the same 2 batteries, most of them using a flash. My battery charge meter has not even shown up yet. When I first read the manual, I didn't understand the value of all the frame, portrait, and scene assist modes. As I've used the camera, though, I've come to see that they are very important. The frame and portrait assistants actually change the location of the auto-focus. When I am in sports mode, the camera's auto-focus is constantly changing so that the picture will shoot quickly when the shutter release is pressed. Shutter speed and aperature are adjusted depending on which scene I've selected. In other words, using the modes makes for much better pictures. They are more than just marketing pitches. The software that came with the camera is okay, though it is nothing earth shaking. Better tools came with my scanner/copier/printer combo, but if you don't have those tools, what comes with the camera is much better than nothing and will get the job done.I'm very satisfied. The camera is so small that I wear it in a tiny case on my belt all the time.BTW, I was going to buy the 2200 instead, but am glad that I didn't. Once I had the manual (which is the same for both cameras), I saw that there are a number of small features that the 3200 has that are not available to the 2200. For example, the 3200 has sound for movies, the 2200 does not. You can record voice memos and set sounds for camera functions with the 3200. The 3200 can take more continuous pictures at a time (due to the higher resolution and space required). There are more differences, and most of them are small, but by the time you add them all up, it's worth the additional $100, in my oppinion.I was an avid amateur photographer back \"in the day\", but grew tired of the hassles of large cameras and film developing. Thanks to this tiny, filmless camera, I'm a photographer again.", "Date": "June 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good camera at good price", "Author": "PGMS \"PGMS\"", "ReviewID": "R3RV3A9UKOKFZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon has always had a reputation for superior photo products, but I never bought one because there was always a near-as-good Pentax or Canon. This time, they've hit a home-run. The Coolpix 3200 is as good or better, according to industry reviews, as other manufacturers' and the price, for a change, is right. Not only that, but once you load the software, you can set the camera up to automatically load the pictures. The camera comes with several editing software programs as well, and they work nicely. You don't have to go out and buy Photoshop.Remember, this is a point-and-shoot. It is not meant for people that have to have all kinds of control over how the picture comes out. If you are a pro, stick to SLRs, either digital (which cost in general, more than $1000) or film, which are still far more than this camera. A strong suggestion: Buy an RCR-V3 rechargeable battery. These are Lithium-ion rechargeables. You can get a Delkin one for under $30 including battery and charger. It will take many more picture than the NiMH.", "Date": "May 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for the amateur photographer", "Author": "Sherilyn", "ReviewID": "R1663OSMBX0ULY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Lightweight, inexpensive, great auto features, panoramic pictures, easy to use, long batter life even on alkaline batteries.Cons: Takes noisy videos if you use auto focus mode.I guess one might call me a camera snob.  I am extremely critical and picky when it comes to my digital images.  So for me to rate this as a 5 means a lot to me.  I like to do a lot of photoshop work and artistic shots so pixel quality is extremely important.This camera makes the 3rd digital camera that I have personally owned and is actually a supplemental camera that I am adding to my collection.  My first camera was a Ricoh RDC-5300 from 1999, it was my faithful sidekick until I dropped it and damaged the lens.  It set a very high bar for me after that.  I replaced it 1 1/2 years ago with a much higher end camera, my Minolta DiMage 7i.  My Minolta has all the bells and whistles on it and is for the most part a digital SLR and I paid a pretty penny for that.  I however discovered that there was a penalty for buying a nice camera... I never wanted to take it anywhere casual.  The size of it (it's a full sized slr) and the weight made it bulky for carrying around on a vacation/trip and the price of it hindered me wanting to take it anywhere that might put it at risk of being grabbed.  So that is where the Nikon came in.  I realized I had a strong need for a more \"casual\" camera, one I could easily tote around and get great pics from and not worry about it being stolen (like on my upcoming cruise in December).I started researching all of the current 3-5mp cameras and was trying very hard to stay around $200 in price.  I quickly became discouraged as I looked at pictures on Steves-Digcams and saw that the current models were taking lesser quality pictures than my old Ricoh that only was 2.3mp!  Most of the cameras I looked at took grainy pictures with lots of noise or color distortion.  I knew I would not be happy with a lower end camera if the images were not good enough for a high quality prints or being edited.  Then I discovered the Nikon Coolpix line.  This camera takes much higher quality pictures than even my friends 5mp camera!  I must say that I am extremely satisfied with my decision.About the features:Where do I begin?  It may not have f-stops and apertures and fancy ISO settings... but this camera does amazing tricks for the little amount of cash I spent on it.**Auto Mode - I've tested this in many lighting conditions (bright light, room lighting, and low lighting) and each time I was impressed.  Pictures of grass blades come out clear and sharp with well defined color.  Animal fur is well defined not softened or blurred.  Pictures of shadows come out solid with no jaggies or purple distortion.  Bright sun did not fade out my pale face self standing next to a white fence.**White balance - The ability for it to measure the exposure in a room is impressive as well, you can go into the settings and easily let it measure the colors in the room to get optimal contrast.**Macro Mode (extreme closeups) - The camera had no pixelation or color distortion when I took pictures.  The blades of grass in a pond and each pine needle of a tree were very colorful and well defined.  The general response I got from people that I showed them too was \"wow\" and \"that little camera really took those?\"**Scene Modes - I have played with only a few of them so I will just name the features I have played with.**Indoor party mode - great for taking indoor pictures with lighting effects (like candles on your childs birthday cake).**Panoramic mode is so simple to use and once you combine it with the Arc software that comes with the camera I think you'll be amazed.  You start by taking one picture, then on the LCD you'll see an outline of the last 3rd of the picture you took on the side of the screen... line it up with the next shot and repeat as many times as needed.  The software they supply effortlessly seams the pictures together for you making beautiful panoramic pictures.**Scene guides - The guides available in portrait modes and landscape modes are wonderful for the amateur and take the worries out of focusing on the subject properly.**Continuous Shot - Very handy and took about 1 photo a second for me.**Auto-Focus - The camera actually projects a red light on where it is going to auto-focus so you know in advance if you are going to get the shot you want.  For those that want to use the half click focus and then move the camera this can come in very handy.Summary:At first I was a little put off by the size (I'm used to holding a nice slr size camera) but quickly became accustomed to it.  I suffer from hand shaking on a regular basis and the first day I tested it was having problems with it... the camera didn't even seem to notice most of the time.  The pictures snapped so quick that my movement didn't even affect it.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone that is picky about the pictures they take of their loved ones and their vacation shots.

I like the fact that you can record video w/ sound, and that you can format it to record in 3 different sizes.  You can take quickshot sports photos, like the ones used in skateboarding magazines to show shot by shot how the trick is done... very cool!  I also like the fact that you can change the picture size to be anywhere from absolutely ENORMOUS to the regular-sized pictures any other camera would take.  The detail is amazing.  I can focus in on dust particles on my desk!  It also takes shots in Black & White, and other effects.  Sure the camera uses up batteries - it's a digital camera - what digital camera DOESN'T use up batteries???  However, this one doesn't eat batteries like my other cameras do.  And it only takes 2 AA's. I really like this camera.CONS ARE:This camera cannot be used as a webcam.  I unfortunately found that out after I bought it, but it's not something that's going to make me take it back to the store.Video quality is very gritty.  It's nowhere near the quality of a video camera, but it is much better than a video camera phone.  Also, if you leave the auto adjust on, the video records clicking sounds as the camera focuses.  I just turned auto adjust off and it's fine now.This camera isn't going to make you a pro photographer, but it's no piece of crap either!  There are plenty of options and buttons to keep you busy for a every long time learning everything that you can do with it, if you want to get into that.  It's also simple enough to be able to say \"ok, I want to turn this thing on and take a picture\".  I figured out how to take a picture less than a minute after having it out of the box.  Very cool.  Very easy.

I use it for posting pictures to the internet for family to see, emailing pictures, and the occassional printout of a 4x6 for a scrap book page.This camera does all of those things very, very well.2 megapixels is more enough for any purpose you have around the house, such as emailing or posting pictures online, creating and printing 3x5 images, even decent-quality 8x10 prints.But 2-megapixel cameras are often short on quality and features, obviously because camera makers want you to buy a more expensive camera. 3 megapixels seems to be a good industry zone for picture quality vs hardware quality and price quality.And you want to know what megapixel really means? Well, 1600x1200 is 1.92 million pixels, or megapixels. The resolution of most pictures I post on the internet is 640x480, which is 0.3 megapixels, which is well within the reach of cell phone cameras or the $20 pocket/keychain cameras you see in the mall.  But it's quality that you get when you pay more for a camera like this.At 3.2mp capacity, the finest-grain image you can store is theoretically 2038 x 1568. If I vertically stacked my two work monitors (max 1800x1440 each, but I use 1600x1200) and rotated one of these images 90 degrees, then I could view it! Might get neck strain, though.For images at acceptible PRINTING quality you need to have about 300 real pixels for every inch of your print's dimensions.  Multiply the inch dimensions by these DPI figures to get the total resolution (horizontal and vertical, typically thousands in each dimension) you need for a decent image, and multiply these together to get a total number of pixels (megapixels.) So, you be the judge. When the wife needs a picture for her scrapbook that is 3\"x5\", then all I need if I use the formula above I found is 3x300 x 5x300 or 1.35 megapixels. For a 4\"x6\" i'd need 2.16 megapixels.  That's all!  This Nikon 3200's 3.2 megapixels is great for these kind of uses and the features is what you end up paying for.Even 8\"x10\" blowups on nice paper with a good printer look good enough at 3.2 megapixels.My Nikon 3200 fits in my pant pocket with the same footprint as my Nokia and without the battery inside weighs ounces only. It's very compact and light. Even with the battery it feels toyish but solid.  Despite its size it is remarkably easy to hold still and manipulate.  I have fairly large hands.One feature inparticular I wanted was Continious or Burst shooting mode. This is where the camera will take 2-3 pictures every 2-3 seconds while holding down the shutter. A must for sports photography. The real sports sideline photographers have cameras that will take pictures like a minigun. This mode also applies to normal folks like you and me when you're taking any sort of picture where the subject is, well, moving. My Nikon 3200 takes 1.5 pictures every 2 seconds, I think, which is decent.When you read a casual customer review, you'll often here people say that indoor pictures are bad. This is totally bunk. A well-lit room for humans is actually poorly lit for a camera and seriously impairs the autofocus's ability to find the target. That's why there's a flash. After reading a lot of reviews of digital cameras here on Amazon.com, I find that most people who complain about picture quality (which is 99% the user's fault in the first place) either don't know how to use the two-stage button (\"have to press really hard and then there's a 1-2 second delay before the picture is taken!\") or refuse/fail/don't have the camera set to use a flash inside. My Nikon has a special setting for indoor pictures with flashes, among other 'scene' modes.  The scene modes are awesome, I've taken very fast sports-like photography and then with the turn of a button taken 4-second exposures of a fireworks show minutes later.As for the durability of this camera, it is a bit toyish, but it seems solid enough.  The lens retracts fully into the camera body so no potential catastrophic angles there.  I have a 256mb SD card that came in a bundle with the camera that is totally overkill.  I bought a CR-V3 battery that has lasted me ~200 pictures, most without flash.  But since it was a non-rechargable battery that cost $18, I bought a rechargable AA battery kit.Absolutely zero complaints about this camera so far.  I trust Nikon implicitly too.", "Date": "August 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera!", "Author": "Carol the Dabbler", "ReviewID": "R3DR0CZ85F1LN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a digital camera, primarily to capture the construction of our new house.  So I spent a couple of months researching options before choosing the new Nikon Coolpix 3200.  I am very happy with my choice.I have a Nikon N4004S SLR 35-mm camera, which I am very happy with, but I wasn't about to take hundreds of pictures of our house with it and spend the money on prints and converting all the pictures to JPEG images to put on a personal web site.  After reading reviews of various digital cameras online, as well as in Consumer Reports and Smart Homeowner, I decided I wanted a 3 Megapixels camera with 3x optical zoom, a Secure Digital card slot, a nice color LCD monitor, date imprinting, audio memo capability, movie mode, good flash range, USB port downloading, excellent optics and color representation, and decent AA battery life.  The Nikon Coolpix 3200 had everything I was looking for and more.  At first I was leaning toward Panasonic, Canon, and Kodak models, but the Nikon won out because of my past experience with Nikon and it seemed to be superior in the features that were most important to me (plus some reviews of the competing models I was considering scared me a bit).Despite what some reviewers have said about this camera, I think it does very well on battery life.  I am using the Nikon EN-MH-1 NiMH rechargeable batteries (I also have the MH-70 charger) and, so far, I am happy with the battery life.  The pictures are absolutely outstanding - the color representation and optics are first class, and the images look great even blown up to maximum on my 15\" LCD computer monitor.  I haven't used all the shooting modes yet (mostly auto mode), but I was pleased to see the improvement in brightness and color of pictures I took during dusk in night mode.  The date imprinting is very handy for taking pictures of the house construction progress and it has been great to be able to take the camera to my Mother-in-law to show her the house pictures on her television using the audio and video cable supplied with the 3200.  The camera is also so compact that it is easy to take pictures with one hand, if necessary, and the zoom is very smooth.  The Nikon View software is a nice bonus.  The only drawbacks I've seen are that the LCD monitor is difficult to see in bright sunlight (not a problem though because I think the view finder is easy to use) and pictures in low light can be dim, grainy, and blurry, especially if you're not in the right mode (dusk or night) and the camera is not stable while taking the picture (a tripod is recommended for night shooting).All in all, a great camera at a very good price!  I recommend it highly.  I also recommend the Panasonic 10 Mb/s 256MB Secure Digital card, which Nikon had tested for this camera.(Note: Since my wife had already registered to post reviews here, I'm writing this under her screen name.)", "Date": "May 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Digital Images", "Author": "Lisa Johannes", "ReviewID": "RZQMWW3HE7TMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on the recommendation of a friend -- truth is, there are sooo many digital cameras out there that I just didn't know where to start.  The images from my friend's camera were remarkably vivid, so I decided to give the Nikon Coolpix 3200 3.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom a try!  I'm glad that I did!As an amateur photographer and an avid scrapbooker, I was looking for two things--excellent prints and compact size.  I get both with this camera.After opening the box, I was completely ready to take pictures in less than 5 minutes, thanks to the quick reference guide included.  After capturing more than 300 photos, I uploaded them all to my computer and sent them away to Photoworks.com.  My pictures arrived in the mail within a couple of days, and they were outstanding.  Unlike the 2.0 megapixal prints I had seen in the past, these were sharp and clear and matched the images I was seeing on the camera's monitor.  No one would be able to tell that these were taken from a digital camera instead of a film camera.I love the scene settings that are pre-programmed into the camera, especially the panoramic, macro, and dusk/dawn settings. The menu is set up intelligently, which means that I haven't had to refer to my owner's manual once since purchasing it almost 2 months ago.  And though I don't use it often, the movie feature is outstanding.  I can take a five minute movie complete with sound to send to family and friends via e-mail.I highly recommend purchasing additional batteries when you buy this, since the ones that come with it won't last very long, especially if you decide to take a movie or two.  In fact, I've started using rechargable batteries.  You'll also need a media card--I bought a 256MB, though I think that a 128MB would give you about 150 pictures (before having to download them to your computer and clear them off of the card).The only thing that I don't like about this camera is the clicking noises that it makes sometimes when I use some features that affect focusing such as macro.  Aside from that, I highly recommend this compact camera!  I've enjoyed it a great deal and even recently discovered that my pictures are equal to the quality of my friend's 5 megapixal camera, since going about 3.2 megapixals does almost nothing in terms of affecting the image of a 4x6, 5x7, or 8x10 print.", "Date": "July 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great point-n-shoot camera", "Author": "The CRITIC", "ReviewID": "R35TDM88CIFZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros1.

Last night I went to a wedding and the gentleman sitting next to me had the Nikon Coolpix 3200, and I was astonished to discover how excellent its battery life was.  The gentleman took over 300 shots, all with flash on and all with LCD on as viewfinder, and he also played back the pictures to lots of guests, and at the end, when we were among the last to leave, the batteries in the camera were still going strong!  I was totally impressed.  I had my Minolta Dimage F300 (5MP camera) with me and the batteries ran out after about 80 shots -- and my NiMH was rated higher than his (2100mAh vs. his 1950, I believe).  I walked away totally sold on the Nikon.OK, I exaggerated.  If the image quality weren't good, perpetual battery life wouldn't have meant much.  But judging from zoomed-in playback on the Nikon's LCD, as well as his comments, the image quality seemed excellent.  Compared to my Minolta Dimage F300, the 3200's images were generally sharper, while the color temperature was not as pleasing as my Minolta's, but still excellent.  He took a wide range of shots, from outdoors to indoors to close-ups to wide-angle... and most came out quite satisfying from a technical point of view.  All were well-exposed, sharp, and evenly lit in cases where flash was used.In addition, I noticed that when I borrowed his 3200 to shoot a few pictures after my Minolta's batteries died, the recycle time on the 3200 was quite fast, unlike my Minolta, which could take 6 or 7 seconds before I could shoot the next shot.  The 3200 was ready in under a second.  The only problem I experienced was there seemed to be a shutter delay with the 3200: after I pressed the shutter, it waited a second or slightly longer before taking the picture.  You may want to keep this in mind when shopping for this camear.  The delay didn't affect the pictures, but did feel weird since my Minolta has virtually no shutter delay.The camera seemed well built.

The batteries that come with the camera are the cheap ones, they lasted all of 4 hours while I got to know the menu system of my new Nikon. This actually made me quite concerned. However, I'd purchased the Nikon NiMH Rechargeable Batteries for CoolPix 3200 with my camera so I charged those up and loaded them. Then went to FL for a vacation. They lasted 3 days shooting 130+ pics (Normal setting), then 2 days taking pics driving home, then a few more days once home. I about fell over. Seems like standard AA's in the top 2 brands of batteries last about as long as well. I don't fully know however since these things (the Nikon NiMH Rechargeable) take forever to run out of juice, and once drained only take 2 to 3 hours to recharge and are ready to go for another 5+ days of shooting, for me anyway. As for the camera the micro pics are just unreal. Everyone I show these incredibly close up images to has the same look, the open mouth dumbfounded look.  Normal images took a while to get right in various situations since you really need to choose the correct mode for the pic your taking.  This camera is not for long range shots, obviously. If you wanted that you'd be looking at something with a larger lens.  All around excellent camera !  The negatives I have are; On really small image subjects, such as something 1/2 an inch or less, the focal plane isn't very deep, so the front of the object may be blurry and the back is clear.  Also on small objects like this the camera wants to focus on the background and has trouble seeing the subject of your picture at times (15% of the time).  And usually its only on the super small objects that have similar color to the background (4 - 6 millimeters). However, when you get the 3200 to focus on these things the results are extraordinary.  Many people are probably mocking me for having such small subjects and passing this off as irrelevant, however, try it. Take a 3200 and take a pic of a fly, or a flower that is 5 millimeters across. When you look at your image and see every hair on the fly, and pollen grains on the flower, and hairs on the stems, you'll be totally blown away.  This camera is extraordinary, I'm thrilled I bought it.Side notes:I put a Panasonic 128 MB Secure Digital Memory Card in my 3200.

It is visible sometimes, I think this can be fixed, however, with a different scene mode, and you can always try to fix it through photoshop, etc.Battery life is decent...not the best, but seems better than 3100/2100.Overall, I rate it 4 stars, only because of the noise and maybe even because of the battery life.

I also took a photo of my ceiling fan in motion and of my husband in his favorite chair (yeah a recliner). The recliner has subtle color changes. Even with the naked eye you have to be sort of close to discern this. Samsung photos showed the chair as being maroon.  The Nikon showed every little color change. The friend in the low light, well her photo came out bright and colors true. No off tints to the flesh tones, no washed out reds, I was amazed.I take my memory card to a Kodak kiosk and print them out there. No editing, cropping, etc. Just a print as taken. They come out perfect every time.This camera has so many great features that I can't wait to try them all, cropping within the camera, sunsets, even night scenes and more.  I will continue to take my Samsung in my suitcase when we travel, but know I'll probably only use the Nikon because reaching in my purse is so much easier than fishing around in a suitcase.I would recommend this camera to anyone who really enjoys taking snapshots, having versatility in a camera and not having to use special batteries or memory cards.

So it has everything out of the box to start using it. I am not one to read manuals. So true to nature I just unpacked it, popped the batteries in and hit on. It started up quick, quicker then I expected. It was very easy to setup the time, date and such. In less then 3 minutes I had taken my first pic. The two-stage button while not new to me having used an SLR does take a bit of getting used to with the digital. It seems to lag after the auto focus.The Menu structure is easy to navigate and understand. I had no problem finding my way thru the menus. Nikon provides a quick start guide and helps greatly in making the initial user experience excellent. I have not had much time to take many pictures and cannot comment on the quality greatly.

For a person who doesn't like to read an encyclopedia of instructions before taking the first pic, this Nikon does a good job being almost intuitive for people like me who just like to take pics, not study engineering science. The pre-set picture modes are generally helpful, but the sports mode doesn't really work for fast action pics, especially if the light is not perfect. I wanted to take pics of my parakeets, they don't just sit there and wait for the camera!!!, so there the camera didn't perform as well as desired. With 256 MG card and Sony rechargeable Ni-MH batteries Nikon 3200 so far has perfomed very well. Whenever flash is used, overexposure is a concern. The main pros being all things small: size, lightweight, simple to use. The picture quality seems very good in digital format and I didn't even use the highest resolution setting. Software is very easy to use, it's \"idiot-proof\" so to say. I have not yet printed out anything, but for the old-fashioned prints I'd rather use my advanced Olympus camera anyway. Can't report on video component since I'd rather use a real dvd camera for that purpose, so for me it doesn't matter if the small Nikon has this feature or no.Among things to be desired - better sports/action mode in less-than-perfect light; less noise for the zoom for discreet seetings like church, exhibition, meeting, museum.Overall, for users who do not expect a CNN cameraperson level of sophistication for mere $181, this Nikon is an excellent buy.

It really is a lot of fun to take pictures, especially with all the wonderful features it has to offer. However, there are a few problems I have with it.For one, after you take a picture, sometimes there is a black screen for about 8 seconds and you can't do anything until the screen comes back. Maybe it takes a little while for the picture to properly register in the play menu, I'm not sure. But it can be frustrating when someone is waiting for you to hurry up and take their picture.Another thing, I have noticed on the movie mode that after you have recorded something and you're playing it back, there is a clicking noise in the background. The first time I heard it I thought it might be just the background noise of what I had recorded. But it kept doing that no matter where I was or what I recorded. It's not too loud and you can still hear what really happens in your movie, but it is definately noticeable. One good thing about the movie mode though is that it lasts a very long time. You can take very long films.Also, I find it hard to control the focus at times. It's more if I'm taking a closeup of something, like a flower or a leaf, and sometimes it won't focus on the flower or leaf. It might focus on something beyond it, and my picture turns out fuzzy. I was taking a photo once at a peculiar angle of this tree branch, but it would not focus on the branch. It kept focusing on the tree trunk behind it. I must have took about 20 pictures, trying to get one of the branch, but what would've been an awesome picture never turned out.One more thing, and I don't know if this is just a glitch in my camera alone, or if it has happened with others, but sometimes the screen will just freeze. It's usually after I take a picture on one particular mode. It's weird. About half of the picture I just took will be on the screen, and it is slightly transparent. The other half is normal. Also, when it is like that, I cannot zoom in or out. I can only take another picture exactly how it is. The only way to get it off is to put it in play mode and then back to picture mode. I haven't heard any other complaints about that, so it might just be my camera alone that does this, I don't know.Overall, it is a fairly nice camera. It's very small, lightwait, and I carry it everywhere with me. It takes some very nice pictures, and the colors turn out abosutely fabulous! They're always really clear pictures. I highly recommend this camera for the casual photographer. It's a camera for a beginner, and it's easy to use. If you are the serious photographer though, I would advise you go with something else.

The images are clear and crisp and movie function is ten times better than the 2100.  The 3200 allows for 640 x 480 movies and the duration is only limited by memory capacity.  With a 512MB card you've got about 15 minutes of recording time.  That might sound small, but it's more than enough to capture important moments.Another improvement over previous models was that Nikon moved most of the controls from the top of the camara to the back.  As a semi-pro 35mm user I balked at this at first.  Then the utility of this change became obvious - it's just plain easier to have most of the controls right there alongside the LCD viewer.I used the 2100 for Internet shots for auctions and for emailing photos to others.  You don't need lots of megapixels for such uses - even the 2100 is overkill.  Still, it's great to have a camera that allows you to go beyond that and actually print your work.Oddly enough, I found the 3200 to be actually slower than the 2100 in terms of writing to media!  I have one of the fastest cards available so the memory card shouldn't be an issue.  I wasn't impressed.  I don't recommend this camera for situations where you want to take multiple shots seconds apart.Another drawback on this model is that the microphone picks up autofocus noise in the movie mode.  It's quite loud, actually.  It's possible to turn off the autofocus which creates a more blurry image.  Still, the quality of the movies is already low enough that this effect seems to be small.  (Like most digital photo models, the 3200 will not give you camcorder results.)Overall, the 3200 is a great bargain.  It's just enough for printing small photos and it delivers a lot of great features at an affordable price.  Just like the 2100 and other similar Coolpix models, it's compact and feels comfortable to hold.  (I've found the similarily sized Canon digital cameras to be awkward at best.)

Note: the Coolpix display tells me it has room for 999 pictures.The seller of the camera was SourceMedia (NorAm International Partners, Inc) fulfilled by Amazon.

So, off I went to research 3 MP cameras.  I didn't want a high megapixel camera because I never get prints larger than 5x7.  I was on the fence with this and the Kodak CX7330.  I was always happy with the old Kodak I had, which seems to be the only manufacturer that takes true photo aspect pictures.  All the other cameras take the computer VGA ratio (4:3) instead of the photo sizes (4:6 or 5:7).  What really made me choose the Nikon was that they make great lenses and that's what photos are all about, not megapixels.  Kodak is great, but they are a print company really, plus their camera has that horrible \"share\" button that I would never use with their dock.  Also, the Nikon had a slightly smaller size, slightly lighter, had a better LCD screen, and the focus-assist lamp.  That's a must-have for low-light situations and you'll be glad you have it when you really need it.  I'm almost never in good lighting situations.So, I got the Nikon and I'm happy I did.  They have a great product and I was immediately WOWed by the screen.  There's no advertised digital zoom (which you shouldn't use anyway), but it's there.  It has easy to use menus, shooting modes, and GREAT software.  It's simple, to the point, but VERY functional.  I had great enhanced pictures in seconds.  Plus, what I really love is the ability to mark photos with a simple \"check\".  I've been looking for this in other programs and just couldn't find it.  Every few months, my wife and I go through all the pictures we've taken and WRITE DOWN each filename to upload to a photo website.  Other software has similar functions, but you can't view the images full screen.  The thumbnails just don't show enough detail to know if the pic was good or not.  With the Nikon software, you can view fullscreen, mark the shot, then search (via the software) for your marked files and upload them to your favorite photo website.There are lots of other great features like voice-memo and video, but I rarely think I'll use either.  If you're looking for a decent camera, but don't want to spend over $200, get this.  You'll be happy you did!
