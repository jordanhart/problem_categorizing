It's promoted that it will work with Mac. After a protracted installation, and many e-mails to support, I finally got it to work. However, the motion detection only works with IE. What good is a surveillance camera without motion detection? My only option is to return for refund.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "For me a perfect Cam", "Author": "Ricardo Meleiro \"Forward can't be stopped\"", "ReviewID": "R2FF7D9KU6C794", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used this cam inside my house just to watch when I am traveling, working faraway from home or something like that. I can install speakers in this equipment and if I wanna say something at the other side of the world the person who are in my home will hear. Have a good image ( not perfect ) but I can recognize a object 20m fair from the cam at night, on the  bright day I can recognize everything that cam is able to record.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "PARA MI LOCAL", "Author": "Juan Carlos", "ReviewID": "R366LB7TR0BX7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "ME GUSTA MUCHO, SE ADAPTA A MI LOCAL, APENAS PARA LO QUE NECESITO.

Better than TP in color, sharp picture, user interface options, tilt option, and price. I'm using it as a baby monitor. The only thing TP has better than Foster is sound volume, same clarity and white noise when silent. Worst on TP that I could not stand and had to return it was the color and sudden loud static noise, though the static seems to only happen on explorer and not firefox, but some functions not available on firefox. TP was minimally functional, but at it's price compared to Foster, completely not worth the hassle.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "TP-camera", "Author": "Joe Koffron", "ReviewID": "RB51I3EY3G0V8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera works ok with a nice picture as well as the audio, although the wireless feature has not ben tried out as yet.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0044DEEWE"}}
