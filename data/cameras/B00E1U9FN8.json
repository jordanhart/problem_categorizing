{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera is okay, everything else is cheap.", "Author": "W. Lopez \"greattobealive\"", "ReviewID": "R1UAOF3BNXTUTN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera in September, 2013 as I was going to China and anticipated many photos.  Camera was easy to figure out so no problems there.  Battery cavity has a flimsy door with a thin metal hinge, I wondered how long that would last.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not ragging on the camera, it performed okay, and took little effort to figure out.  The accessories however were a different story.  The strap, camera case, especially the stitching is poor.  Mine started falling apart during my vacation.  The zipper is very awkward to close, it doesn't flow freely and it's always a fight to get it closed.  The camera top also has a velcro catch that I used instead of the zipper.I'm lucky because I have a decent camera case.  The camera is almost all plastic and doesn't resemble the quality of something vintage, but what new camera does for under $300 (none).  Again, no complaints on the picture quality, did a good job.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Maxine", "ReviewID": "R2WJT90VHP6CGJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my first Fuji and will probably be my last. Wish I would have returned it before the 30 day return policy expired but thought the poor pictures were just me trying to figure out the camera. 3 months and hundreds of pictures later I am ready to count my loss and buy another camera. Pictures are poor quality in color and sharpness. I usually end up deleting more than half of the pictures I take. My Kodak was definitely a point and shoot and I literally wore it out. My daughter has a Fuji, just a different model that they no longer offer and she's been happy with hers but I'm not with mine.  The disappointing Christmas pictures have convinced me that this is not the camera for me. It has lots of \"extras\" that sold me on the camera, but what good are they when the picture is dark and grainy or blurry. Don't understand why the \"automatic\" setting will show the \"flower\" when I'm inside taking family shots. The flash often doesn't fire at all when inside pictures are taken. I usually take twice the pictures I want because only about 1 out of 4 are usable.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would buy again", "Author": "walter phillips", "ReviewID": "R34RWFQNGNX2M0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice Camera.Best for the money.Everything works.Good for close-up pictures.Macro pictures come out great.Used for indoor pictures and looks great.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16MP\nHD MOVIE RECORDING\n3.0 LCD\nINDIVIDUAL SHUTTER", "Name": "Fuji 16MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aMoANQVXL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E1U9FN8"}}
