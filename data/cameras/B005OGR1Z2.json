{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's great, for what it is.", "Author": "J. Wischkaemper", "ReviewID": "R2ZE2WARPR8EH7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's been a lot of talk about Nikon's new 1 Series cameras, and a lot of disappointment over the CX sensor size, and the perceived lack of quality compared to Sony's larger APS-C NEX cameras. Many enthusiasts have been understandably frustrated by this move, wanting the best of all worlds - D3 quality in a point and shoot body. The J1 doesn't quite hit that mark, but if you understand what you're buying and play to the camera's strengths, it's a great piece of gear for the beginner, enthusiast, and the pro alike.For clarification, I am primarily evaluating the J1 for its use *as a camera* - I won't touch much on the video or motion snapshot modes.The Good:* As a part-time professional, I bought this camera primarily because of its size, and the ability (hopefully) to use my collection of F-mount lenses in the future. In this respect, the J1 is fantastic. My first mirrorless purchase was a Sony NEX-3, and I was overall very happy with it, but the size of the lens still made carrying it around a real chore. Unfortunately, this really comes down to physics - there are physical constraints on how small you can design a lens with a 55mm focal length (concretely, it can't really be much less than 55mm in length). Fundamentally, this is where the CX format helps the J1 significantly. Due to its smaller sensor size, it is possible to construct equivalent lenses which are significantly smaller and lighter than for the APS-C format. The promise of being able to use standard-range high-quality zoom lenses (think a 17-55 f2.8, for instance) as mid-range telephotos is certainly intriguing. There is no such thing as a free lunch, and obviously the wide end and depth of field suffer here, but I am hopeful that Nikon or third party manufacturers will address that concern as much as they can. At the moment, however, the J1 with its kit lens is a camera that is, while not pants-pocketable, certainly coat-pocketable.* The autofocus system is fantastic, especially in good light. I've been particularly impressed at the ability of the J1 to track a subject around the frame. I've been a big fan of Nikon's 3D tracking AF since I first saw it in action on the D300, but the J1 really takes it to a new level. The subject tracking mode is fast and very responsive, and once you've locked it on something, it does a very good job of staying with your targeted subject. Nikon claims that the J1 and V1 focus faster than the D3, and while I haven't used a D3 in a while, the J1 focuses fast enough (in good light) that I wouldn't doubt the claim.* Image quality is actually quite good. I was fearful of how bad the noise would be on a smaller sensor, but I've been reasonably impressed with the results so far. JPEG results out of the camera are not stellar at high ISO - there's certainly some aggressive noise reduction going on - so you will certainly want to switch to RAW for best results. At present, ACR will not open J1 files, but Capture NX2 will. The ACR 6.6 beta results posted on dpreview.com are encouraging, being close to on-par with previous generation sensors (D90, D300, etc). Without access to the files in my normal workflow (Lightroom), it's hard for me to make a direct comparison on how much you can eek out of a RAW file on the J1 compared to other cameras, but so far I've been pleased.UPDATE: Lightroom version 3.6 (beta) is out, and I've had a chance to play around with several of the images I've taken over the past few weeks. Again, I've been reasonably impressed. This is not a D3. With standard noise reduction in LR, I think the image quality is easily better than my D200 was, which given the size of the sensor is quite impressive. It is certainly better than the higher end point and shoots I've owned (Panasonic LX-2, Canon S90 - which to be fair are a couple of years old).Things that could be improved:* The interface. The camera tries to take care of a lot of things for you, and for the most part it does an ok job. If you're trying to access things like you would on a DSLR, you may have some problems. It would be nice to see Nikon update the firmware with the ability to reassign some of the buttons to tasks that are more useful in manual mode, but as with any wish-list feature, it's not something you should plan on happening if you're buying the camera. Overall, the interface isn't worse than the NEX-3, so I'm not displeased. I'd like things to be more accessible, but the camera is perfectly usable as it is.* The high-speed electronic shutter setting is very, very restrictive with regard to the settings you can change. Things you have no control of if you want to use the high-speed capture: Program mode only (no aperture, shutter or manual), ISO (Auto 100-3200 only), metering (matrix only), focus mode (AF-A only), and focus tracking (area mode only). I was rather looking forward to using the high-speed mode, but frankly these restrictions make it pretty difficult to use with any kind of creative control.* There doesn't seem to be a way to turn off the image preview after you take a picture, which is somewhat problematic if you are trying to capture a string of pictures. You can take a single shot, or a burst of pictures, but in either case you can't use the camera again until the preview goes away, which generally takes 2-3 seconds. This won't be a big deal most of the time for most people, but it does make capturing any kind of action problematic. Simply adding an option to turn this off in firmware would go a long way.Things that you might care about, but aren't strictly speaking critical to being a camera:* Video seems to require more light than stills - at least if you are using the 720p60 and definitely if you are using the high-speed video. High-speed is somewhat gimmicky, perhaps, but don't plan on using it indoors. There simply won't be enough light. The 720p60 video is nice - certainly smother than a lot of SLR and mirrorless video out there, including my experience with the NEX-3. I don't know that you're going to get broadcast quality, but things have come a long way in just a couple of years.* The smart selector function seems to work fairly well, but since you can't see the images it throws away, it's hard to really know. I haven't used this function extensively, but when I have, I've been happy with the pictures it's kept.Should you buy a J1? It depends. If you're intrigued, but not completely sure you need one, I might wait for the next generation. If you want to be able to carry a small, light camera that offers fairly good image quality - especially if you have a set of Nikon lenses - this would be a good choice. If you're a parent who wants to take pictures of your kids at their sports games, when paired with a longer range zoom, the Nikon J1 will get you some great results. If you want a camera that weighs half a pound, can fit in your pocket, has a 25x f2.8 zoom, and gives you noise-free images at ISO 204,800... you'll need to look somewhere else.At the end of the day, the J1 is a compromise, and it doesn't really pretend to be otherwise. You won't get the low light performance you would in an APS-C camera, but you won't be carrying ten pounds of gear with you either. When buying the J1, my personal philosophy was the following: if I'm in a situation where my primary concern is image quality, I'll bring my pro gear along. Otherwise, I'll carry the J1, and thereby have the possibility of capturing scenes, albeit at reduced (though still acceptable) quality, because my camera is with me, instead of sitting at home.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great start", "Author": "Albie \"Do Right\"", "ReviewID": "R14C0V8QGYAY4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially preordered the V1, most of the lens, and the flash. I realized I was getting a Nikon 1 camera so that I don't have to carry so much camera equipment. I cancelled the V1, and I purchased the J1 black instead. I am glad I did.I think for most people the J1 and 10 - 30 mm kit is the best choice. The 10mm pancake lens is nice if you want to do a lot of shooting in low light, but you can't zoom. Most of you are used to zooming, and when you can't get closer with your feet because of some barrier, you won't be happy. Many are posting that the 30 - 100 mm lens is very good too. I would have gotten that one for my J1, but I have Nikon lens for my Nikon dSLR D5100. I plan on buying the adapter so I can use my current dSLR Nikon lenses on the J1 for fun.The J1 is a great little camera, but you do need to read parts of the manual. If you are someone who likes to capture the moment, this camera is very good in bright light. The colors (white balance) is very good, and in bright light the camera will focus more quickly than most cameras out there. This is great camera for someone (example, my wife) who likes to just shoot and not worry too much about all the photographic technical  mumbo jumbo.The Nikon 1 cameras are very good in both pictures and video. I think there is one other mirrorless brand that does video as good as the Nikon 1 cameras. When I use my D5100 Nikon dSLR for video, I just have to accept the fact that there will be enough moments where the D5100 is trying to find focus, and so the video will have many small instances of a blurry picture. For most of us, the video of the Nikon 1 J1 will be very good for our family and social events. The Nikon 1 J1 has better auto focus video than any dSLRs out there.My previous ''small' camera was the Canon S90. I really liked it. I have compared the J1 to the S90. You have to increase the sharpness in the J1 menu settings to match the sharpness of the S90. The J1 beats the S90 in color accuracy. I love the colors (white balance) from this new camera. It is as good or slightly better than my Nikon D5100, which is a great dSLR.I am enjoying this new toy. Hanging the camera on my neck or shoulder is much more comfortable than my DSLR. If you can afford it, I recommend getting the J1 10 - 30 mm kit. In bright light it is fantastic with great fast focus and great color. You do need to read the manual on the topics of vibration reduction (VR) and active dynamic lighting. For pictures you will want the VR to be on 'normal' most of the time. For video, you probably will need to put VR on 'active.' This is currently the best camera for both very good pictures AND very good video. As a father, I really regret not taking enough small video clips of my kids, especially of them speaking. Like any camera, you do need to use good holding technique, read the manual, and learn to use this new toy if you want to get the most out of it. If you just like to point and shoot, this will do that too.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its a compromise with GREAT color and FAST autofocus.", "Author": "Kentucky Rose", "ReviewID": "RCA01E0ZRTOV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my new Nikon J1 with 10-30mm lens for one week and have taken about a 1000 test shots with it. A decent compromise between the dSLR and the point and shoot, and I get video.  The color is superb. The auto focus has NO problems. The image review has been very accurate. If the images did not get enough light then they were darker on the review screen and I re-shot them. There is some amount of vignetting at the corners, especially at each end of the zoom range. At f/9.0 everything is very nice and clear. I believe there is some distortion at the 10mm end, but perhaps the 10mm /2.8 lens will not have this problem. I also purchased the 30mm-110mm lens and have been very happy with the quality of the pictures. Like any new camera there is an adjustment period and learning how to shoot it. I have learned to shoot in A-mode outdoors and S-mode indoors to get the type of images I want. I wanted something light than my Sony A700 that still took good pictures, especially macro work, and this lens delivers for that. For landscapes, the jury is still out on that one due to possible distortion issues. I don't normally shot in RAW mode, so adjusting the images in Photoshop has not been a problem. Video seems to work nicely. I was strongly considering buying the Sony Nex-5N, especially since I could use my A-mount lens on it, but decided against it because it requires a separate microphone for sound and has no attached flash. This made the camera less easy for capturing in the moment photo shots and video and more gear to carry around. Purchased the White body and lens and loving it. Glad I bought it? After getting familiar with it - YES.Update:  After using the camera a little longer I would say one disadvantage is the shadow cast by the lens when using the flash up close.  You can not use the flash when you are standing close to the object or there will be this little brown shadow at the bottom of the picture.  To compensate, just step back and zoom in and no shadow.  I purchased my camera kit from a local store and paid full price of $899, which is irritating when I see the sell prices from some of the online stores.  I found a piece of lint in the front glass of the 30-110mm lens.  I took it back to the store and they promptly replaced it, no problem.  I actually took an Olympus PEN camera home to try out and took it back the very next day.  It did not hold up in comparison to the Nikon J1 at all.  The video works great on the J1, it focuses constantly and keeps a sharp image.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon 1 J1 is a great camera if you know how to use it.", "Author": "Thomas M.", "ReviewID": "R17F4A1Q0Q6I5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My main reason for buying this camera is because of the size and picture quality. It was either this or the Canon t4i, if you've gone to do photoshoots and pass-by photos at anime conventions you know you'll be walking around for hours getting as many pictures of cosplayers as possible. I have to say i'm satisfied with my purchase, the picture quality is good considering the sensor size; better than a point-and-shoot and about the same quality as an entry level Dslr. The battery life I wish was better.Few things I want to point out to people who have problems getting good photos with this camera. When in an area with low light use your flash, the camera does handle poorly with little light if you dont use a flash. If you're outside set your ISO to 100; pictures come out much better than keeping the camera on auto 100-3200 when outside. Also try shooting in RAW or RAW + Fine if you post process. One of the most important things to do is to set your Vibration Reduction settings to Normal. The camera has it set to Active by default. Active is for when you are in a vehicle and such so the camera can take better stills while on the move. Normal is for when you move the camera so camera will compensate for you when you move it.The Nikon J1 feels very sturdy and not cheap like other cameras, the front colored part is made of metal and the back feel like quality plastic. My first J1 was the white version that came with just 10-30mm lens. I sold that one and bought the silver color with the 10-30mm and 30-110mm. The white paint is glossy and if you're sweating or have greasy hands, the camera becomes slippery. The glossy paint is also a magnent for fingerprints. The silver however is of a non-gloss paint which wont bother you if your hands are sweaty or greasy.The flash is ok, not great but ok. If you are not using the 10mm prime lens you'll have to back up a bit and zoom in so you wont have a shadow at the bottom of your pictures due to the height of the flash and the length of the lens. Still not horrible for a built in flash.The video mode is great. You can record 30 minute clips, then you'll have to press the record button again. With a 32mb San Disk Extreme SDHC card I recorded video for over 2hrs without overheating recording in 720p 60fps, but I was inside a cool place when I tested it. Then on another day I was outside in 90 degree plus temperatures to a cosplay met-up, the camera overheated after 2hrs of doing photoshoots and 17 minutes or recording. The video is quality is still very good though. just done expect broadcast quality. The microphone is decent, wish it could have been a little better. but not bad for the price.Pros:*Photo quality is better than a Point-and-shoot and close to an entry level Dslr.*Great photos when there is enough light and know how to use the camera.*You can record video in 720p for 1hr and 20 minutes on one battery charge is pretty good.*Easy to navigate menus.*Nice cool look.*Lens are great since they are multi-coated. Never had a problem with lens flare even in strong sunlight.*Can use SDHC and SDXC cards.*Very fast continous shooting.*Very light and compact. Can fit in your pocket if you use the 10mm prime lensCons:*Handles poorly in low light if you don't use the flash.*Battery I wish was better. 250 photos on one charge*No lens hood for the 10-30mm lens (have to purchase separately) But comes with the 30-110mm*Microphone in video mode isn't much to brag about, I give it a 3/5*Price", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not an entry level camera, but very rewarding if you are willing to work for it", "Author": "Pedro A. Vera", "ReviewID": "R3V9ICAV74RE8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a former Nikon D50 owner, I abandoned the camera because I started carrying much smaller Sony DSCs I could simply slip in my pocket. I still miss the D50 after all these years, even if the Sony DSC line only got better. This Nikon 1 J1 replaces my current Sony, a DSC-HX9v.For starters, this is not a point and shoot. The automatic modes are nice, but they won't do anything you can already do with much cheaper point and shoot cameras. That said, if you are willing to do the work and learn the camera, you will be rewarded. I am really happy with the pictures I am getting, but it took me weeks to get used to it.Ergonomics:The camera is basically a slab, it doesn't have contoured edges or soft grips. I find it really comfortable, it fits in my hands just fine but some will get nervous at using this camera without a wrist strap. I only used the strap that shipped with the camera for a few days until I received my Gordy strap, which works extremely well.I like that it is pretty much impossible for the camera to power up just from sliding within a case, unlike the Sony DSC-HX9V which did this all of the time. There's a downside to this, it is very hard to find the power button by touch (the camera will wake up if you have a lens with a lock button and you engage it). The shutter button is exactly where I expect it, unlike again the Sony.Camera body/controls/etc:This camera is beautiful, it draws a lot of attention, which may be the opposite of what you want. I imagine the silver and black bodies from a few feet away will look like any other camera, but the white version just stands out too much. The fit and finish are really nice, I am not a fan of the pop up flash but it works. The flash cannot pop up unless you unlock it manually.The bottom door for the battery and memory card access has a decent latch and has yet to open accidentally.The cover for the micro HDMI and USB is hard plastic, no idea how log it will last if you actually use these cables a lot. I only used them once to test the HDMI cable.The back controls are extremely simple, they took very little time getting used to. The main command wheel does NOT include PASM, those are accessed through the shooting menu. The main command wheel actually looks kind of naked, since it only has four modes.The second command wheel has a nice texture and the spinning element has a notch action, again a nice touch.Lenses:I bought the kit with the 10mm prime and the 10-30mm VR zoom. I spent a lot of time agonizing over this choice, but I am really happy that I got the prime instead of going for the kit with the two zooms. The only downside is that the prime doesn't have VR. As part of a Christmas promotion Amazon gave me a free memory card and a remote, the remote came in really handy while I was learning to get used to the 10mm prime, since this was the first time in years that I was shooting a camera without built-in optical stabilization and/or vibration reduction. After a few weeks I got the hang of it and shake is no longer an issue, it was just a matter of unlearning bad habits I picked up from spending so much time with point and shoot cameras.The 10-30 is a sweet little lens. It is very small, and it has a lock mode that allows it to collapse for storage. This means that the camera is not really that much bulkier when carried with the 10-30mm than with the 10mm prime.My personal preference is to keep the 10mm on as default, unless I know I will be shooting video or that available light is not going to be an issue. I am dying to get my hands on the 10-100 VR lens, which right now costs as much as what I paid for the camera, the 10mm and the 10-30VR.Pictures/Video:The pictures are disappointing if you are expecting the camera to do all the work. It pays to dig into the manual and venture into the PASM mode, it was a lot less painful than what I expected. You can do some really impressive work with PASM modes with really little work. I wish I could do more than +/- 2EV adjustments, and it won't let me auto bracket, but except for those two things it has been a joy to shoot. Also, with the sound effects muted it is completely silent, which is awesome for candid shots.As for the autofocus, it is as fast as advertised. My only issue with the autofocus was while shooting video, and I am not done experimenting with the different custom settings for that.Two of the auto modes are more for show. There is a mode that will shoot a very short video and then freeze at the end, and it adds some background music. There is also a mode that shoots a high speed burst, then tries to pick the 5 best pictures of the batch. This mode is slow and cumbersome, to me it is mostly as a way to demo the capabilities of the camera.The plain vanilla auto mode is decent, but creative types will soon end up leaving it set in one of the PASM modes instead.This camera cannot shoot 1080p video at 60p, it either does 30p or 60i. At 720p it will do 60p. You can also shoot fast speed videos at either 400 or 1200fps, which are encoded to be played at normal speed and yields some interesting slow motion effects. I have not had issues posting these videos to Youtube but I noticed that the Xbox 360 channel for Youtube won't display the high speed burst videos.Conclusions:This is not a camera for a newbie, or somebody that spends most of the time in full auto mode. Think of this as a camera for somebody that would rather have a DSLR and a dozen lenses but doesn't want to lug all that gear around. I actually freaked out when I realized that I could have had a Nikon D3100 and the 18-55 kit lens for $150 less, but in reality this is the form factor that I needed, I don't like hauling around a big camera.Also, keep in mind your color choice if you would rather blend into the background when taking pictures because the white camera attracts a lot of attention (I imagine this is going to be 10 times worse if it is the pink one). I doubt anyone will blink twice at the silver or black versions.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera for the NONprofessional", "Author": "Joseph Adiasor \"Hungry like a Wolf\"", "ReviewID": "R3KZ12V3CIOB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start this review HONESTLY...I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL.  I am just a normal guy that got tired of going on trips and seeing grainy unfocused blurry pictures when I got back home.  I was looking into SLR cameras but they are too expensive for someone that just wants to shoot and have the pictures look good.  I started looking into DSLR cameras (youtube is a great source for reviews).  It eventually came down to the Sony brand camera everyone rants and raves about and the Nikon J1.  Now according to the reviews and a little experimenting of my own..The Sony gives a slightly better picture, but I chose the Nikon mainly because of price.  It was $550 when I bought it, and for the quality of pictures I get I definitely think it was worth it.  YOU CAN GET SLR QUALITY PHOTOS OUT OF THIS CAMERA.  I personally feel like every shot I take is a good one.  took it downtown this past weekend to get some Earth Day gathering pics, and I even believed I was a professional for a second. Extremely clear, beautiful pictures out of thing. This camera takes great pictures! The menu is easy to navigate, gives you plenty of options.  The video shooting is good as well, and the ability to take pictures while shooting video is a cool perk.

You will not have the shallow DOF but buy a full frame for that or do it in PS.  You have to compare apples to apples. The price might seem a bit high right now but if you buy it with the 10mm prime like I did you only pay 150 dollars for that lens. It's a lovely lens too. Sharp at f2.8 and stellar at f4. The kit 10-30 zoom is really quite good.  I purchased both the V1 and J1. I decided to keep the J1. I don't use a view finder and wanted something smaller to take instead of my DSLR. Both camera's are nice. Build quality is great and the high iso raw files are on par with DSLR's of a few years ago.  I would have liked the controls for settings to be buttons and not in the menu.

I'm not a professional, but I know a bad picture when I see one. All of the pictures I took on the camera looked great... until I transfered them to my computer. Blurry, unfocused pictures was what I saw over and over. The only good pictures I saw were the ones taken outside with lots of light, and to be honest, they weren't any better than the same pictures taken with my 5-year old Sony Cybershot. The auto ISO does not adjust well on this camera, so if you're inside, you probably need the flash to get any kind of decent picture without blur and graininess. I took over 500 pictures in a week of owning this camera, and over 30 minutes of footage. I adjusted every setting possible and tried all types of pictures in all types of light. I maybe got a handful of good pictures out of this camera and they were all in good light.The picture quality of the video looked great, but if you're recording, you better have your camera on a tripod or be holding it really still, because every tiny movement is a huge jerk on this camera. The videos I recorded turned out absolutely awful (besides the picture because it's 1080p).The reason I bought this camera was so that I could have some of the luxuries of a dSLR without the bulky body. I was looking forward to all of the features this camera was supposed to offer. I was excited that you could take a picture while recording video and take up to 60fps.

I have tried both V1 and J1 and I chose this camera over the V1.  This is my favorite mirrorless camera over the Sony Nex and M43. Here are my reasons.  I have a Canon 7D with various lenses as my primary system.  I use that camera for more serious picture taking for various reasons like larger more comfortable body, better lenses for precise situations that I collected over the years, bigger flash options, larger resolution for better cropping and larger prints, optical viewfinder, and \"professional feel and look(?)\".  Well, that camera does give an impression that I mean business and that I take photography more seriously to those that I am taking pictures of.  Still, it's not convenient to take that system everywhere and for every occasion. (For example, going to an event where I am a guest and not \"the\" photographer.)  I don't like the limit set by the usual slow lens of the point and shoot with limited options.  I then discovered mirrorless option.  I read many reviews for various options.  I first tried the Nex 3C as it was rated as the best replacement for DSLR with same size sensor, and I was very impressed by it.  I was able to get the pictures I wanted as with my DSLR in various settings.  I then looked into other options.  I stumbled upon V1 review.  Then, I saw how cheap it was.  I was able to buy V1 with 10-30mm and 30-110mm lens kit for very cheap.  I loved the simplicity of it.  Still, coming from Nex I was bit disappointed in the low light capability using the kit lens and lack of bokeh.  Sharp pictures with very very little bokeh.  I mostly take portraits and I do like to isolate my subjects...  I was bit disappointed because I could get decent bokeh even from the kit lens of Nex...  I then ordered 18.5mm f/1.8 hoping that it will solve my problem.  Well, I received the lens and I was instantly happy.  I recommend that lens as MUST to all Nikon 1 users.  Great subtle bokeh and great image quality.  It's also compact!  Still, my wondering eyes looked at the J1.  I compared the specs and the reviews claimed that all the important features were same minus buffer size, lower resolution display, smaller battery, no EVF, cheap build quality, mechanical shutter, and no slot for external accessories like more powerful flash.  Well, I decided to try it out since I don't mind not having EVF as I got used to Nex.  I got the silver one and it's perfect.  I love the smaller size and weight of J1 over the heavy and bulkier V1.  I also love the clean design.  Reduced display resolution make no difference.  J1 display looks just as good as V1.  Really.  No one will notice the difference if they no one tells them that J1 has less resolution display.  I also prefer the built in flash of J1 over the hotshoe slot of v1.  Less accessory to carry.  I bought mirrorless over DSLR over convenience.  Build Quality if plenty good enough and its so much lighter.  Reduced features like EVF and mechanical shutter means smaller size.  J1 is pocketable. (Jacket and with 10mm pancake, even pants)  V1, not so much.  V1's weight negated the lighter lens of Nikon 1 system.  I almost exclusively shot with electronic shuttle as it enabled candid silent shot.  Image quality in not effected in any way.  There is almost no advantage of mechanical shutter.  It has all the important features of v1 like fast hybrid af, fast burst shots, slow motion, full HD Video, etc.  As for battery, I take a spare. (V1 just has an exceptional battery life.  That doesn't mean that J1 has a bad battery life.)  Even in sunny day, I rarely need evf.  I can compose just fine.  Also, I don't want the bulk all the time for an occasional situation of strong light to the LCD.  It's a hassle but I squint and use my hand to shade.  I rather do that on rare occasions than again carry the bulk.  J1 paired with 18.5mm f/1.8 again is perfect for me.  There are many people who complain Nikon 1 system not having enough lenses.  Well, they are growing.  Still, I am done.  I have the 10-30mm for versatility during a vacation, 30-110mm for kid's playing sports outside, and 18.5mm for anything and everything from portrait to in door.  I already have a complete system for Canon 7D.  I just want a good camera that is convenient and portable and able.  95% of my everyday needs.  Nikon J1 is definitely more than good enough to be that camera.PS:  For those getting the Nikon 1 J1 as only camera.  Get the 3 lenses kit I mentioned and call it a day.

I've shot D/SLRs forever (Nikon N70 and D70/D2X and Minolta before that) and like the image quality and control that those cameras offer. Compacts just don't cut it, particularly in autofocus performance. This camera is different:1) it's small enough to carry in a jacket pocket2) autofocus performance is on par with DSLRs3) the sensor and lens are big enough to produce good quality images. The combination of high ISO, VR on the lens and the large sensor allow the camera to take sharp, well-exposed pictures even in poor light. You'll get used to this quickly.The gripes you read about in reviews of this camera are overblown. It's true there aren't lots of control nobs and you'll need to go into the menu to change, say, from Program mode to Shutter mode. But I usually stay in P all the time anyway so it's not a big deal. Plus since the camera is quite small to begin with it's ok that there are relatively few buttons. The camera does go to sleep, but you'll soon get in the habit of tapping the shutter button as you bring it up to eye level to wake it up. As for the lack of an electronic viewfinder, if you want that, buy the V1 and put up with the bigger body and lack of built-in flash. The LCD on this camera is good enough to compose on in even in direct sunlight.I like this camera a lot because it's almost as small as a compact but has nearly all the performance of a DSLR. Right now the main gap with DSLRs is the lack of an ultra wide lens (equivalent say to the 11-16 Tokina DX lens), but I'm hopeful that will be rectified over time.

I was little confused to see lot of negative reviews about J1 but after looking at it in Bestbuy and using it for couple of weeks I can definitely say it takes excellent images in daylight and with little extra knowledge in night as well. For decent night pictures keep Exposure to Auto Shutter (S) and speed close to 1/20. Aperture will be set automatically. ISO could be set to AUTO 100-3200 for decent night pictures. In day time Standard Auto exposure can take excellent sharp images without much effort. Auto focus is quite fast and accurate. Having ability to focus many points in same shot is extra ordinary. It could be adjusted as well.Best thing about J1 it has great 3\" fluid LCD screen. It gives a snap-shot(just a glimpse) of picture taken after each shot. Which is good considering if the picture was blurry, you have chance to correct it. Navigating menu is simple, there is also manual mode for precise setting. Lot of People have criticized J1 for its sensor size but it double or thrice the size of most point and shoot cameras. Yes, it is lower than MFT camera like Sony Nex5 or Panasonic Lumix G3. Again bigger sensor will add bulk to body, bargain..! My preference is smaller camera which is simple to carry around and takes good picture.If you have money take 30-100mm which is bargain at $749(if purchased with body). It would allow to zoom subject really close which is quite difficult with 10-30mm pancake lens. For daily use 10-30mm is sufficient.Motion Snap shot dial mode is really fun, it takes amazing slow motion video with a snap at the end. For shooting moving subject and uploading to you tube its quite handy.Video quality is quite good and it is possible to take at 1080p resolution. But the video size is quite big, i need to find ways to crop it. Probably with lower resolution would help.To sum up if you are PS holder this one of best camera for upgrade without adding much bulk to the body. For advance user depending of their objective they may or may not like it.Update: Taking one star off because this camera doesn't have in body stabilizer and you tend get blurry picture if you don't have stable hands. Night shot not the best if you take into account the price.Update:Returning the camera because u can't use micro 4/3 lenses on them, hence limited choice for experiment.

Thus far the Nikon J1 is meeting that need.  It has the simplicity of a point and shoot but allows for different lenses to give some degree of flexibility in your photos.  The advanced CMOS processor allows for better shots in low light than my previous camera.  There some pretty cool features such as the Smart Photo Selector mode which allows continuous shots of a subject from which you can chose the best shot.  It also takes high quality HD movies.  All things considered I am happy with the J1.  It is a good camera for the price.

Find an off brand battery as the Nikon brand battery is $30+.  I found one for $10 on Amazon.  2. I purchased my J1 with the 10-30mm lens.  In retrospect I would have chosen the 30-110mm as the 30mm zoom isn't quite strong enough for my needs.  Ideally buy both.  3.  This isn't a camera that you can stash in your pants pocket.

I am an artist who uses photography with Photoshop to achieve whatever results I want at the time. I own a Nikon F1 with many assorted lenses, a D3200 with all lenses, and now a Nikon 1 J1, again with all four lenses.The F1 is ridiculously technical for me. It sits on a shelf. The D3200 I bought last summer thinking I would get up and get out with it and start to take more pictures. I didn't. As a novice, I was intimidated by the plethora of settings, bells and whistles. That kit sits on a shelf as well. I opened the J1 a couple of days ago and finally had some time to play with it tonight.Having read the reviews, I stashed the kit lens and attached the 18.5. Most of the reviews mention a lack of performance indoors or with partial darkness and I wanted to test it out. So. My wife is asleep next to me, her light is out. The flat screen is on about 20 feet away, and the lamp on my night stand is on. It is an antique lamp with a beige parchment shade. I have a 60 watt CF bulb in it. The lamp is a whiskey jug my dad converted in 1950 with college stickers all over it.I didn't set up or reset anything on the Nikon - right out of the box, 18.5 lens, that's it. I snapped a pic of the flat screen. Then I shot a pic of the lamp from across the room. Then a close up. They came out beautifully. Clear, sharp, well lit and deep, rich color. Depth of field is excellent with just enough bokeh to set off the focal points. The detail on the lamp close up is amazing. The relief of the applied decals, even grains of dust. Clear as can be. From a camera several people complained would not take photographs indoors. Yeah right.I will play with this more when it's not 2 am. But so far I am very, very happy with this little camera.I bought the  Nikon GR-N2000 Camera Grip. As the camera doesn't have a grip on the body. Excellent.A bit more...The camera is larger than my wife's CoolPix, and feels like a \"real camera' in your hand. It has heft to it, unlike the Coolpix, which just feels like a point and shoot. Feels like quality. Looks industrial and sleek - I got the white. It looks \"German\" if you get my drift. Bauhaus by way of Japan?Yes. The J1 is little more than a mirrorless point and shoot. Yes, it has a small processor. No, it's not the perfect end all and be all camera destined to take the place of your DSLR. It is, however, a nice little unit. It's a new direction for Nikon, and after having been around their products since I was a child, I trust them to have researched, tested, developed and dialed-in a superior, flexible, useful camera. It's what they do at Nikon.In terms of reviews and ratings? For a little camera like this one, it's pointless to get too technical. It's not a technical camera. It's a tourist camera. Smaller than a DSLR, but better quality images than a point and shoot.I mean, do you need to pick apart every technical detail on a $500 camera that comes in pink? Get a hobby, right?If you are a professional or highly technical - read \"anal\" - photographer, stick to your gear - this might be overly simple for you. But if you're going on a fun vacation or weekend getaway, this may be the kit for you.The Mrs and I are heading on a cruise to Europe and around the Mediterranean for our honeymoon this year. It's why I bought this camera. Glad I did. I don't know a lot yet, but I am confident this little jewel will perform flawlessly.(An aside and recommendation - I bought the  COSMOS Brown Leather Case Cover Bag as well. It is just beautiful and functional and has the feel of a leather camera case from 50 years ago. A truly elegant little item if you're so inclined.

The low-light color reproduction is especially good.  I shot a cathedral AFTER they turned off most of the lights and the pictures were gorgeous.  The Nikon 1 has very fast focusing along with everything else it does.  The whole package seems aimed at catching action.  Between the fast burst mode, Nikon's new Motion Snapshot, Smart Photo, and the high-speed video there is little that escapes its lens.VIDEO QUALITYI have yet to put this up on a big screen but on smaller screens the video seems quite good.  Just the fact that it auto-focuses during normal-speed video shooting is a plus point.  One quick tip: you will want to change the video format to one of the 60i if you want to view it directly on your iPad.  30p doesn't translate.The high-speed video (an awesome 400 fps and a super slow 1200 fps) is one of my favorite features as this is a rare feature in cameras.  It does scale down the resolution so don't expect recreating Discovery's Planet Earth moments but it is fun to play with.SIZEI think Nikon found a happy place between camera size and SLR quality with the Nikon 1.  In fact I really, really like the size.  However, it is a bit of an awkward shape and by that I mean it is neither an SLR or a compact so finding the right case to hold the camera and a second lens that is not bulky can be a challenge.  Holding it feels just right.  Shooting with it is easy enough but you do have to make sure you don't cover the auto-focus sensor while adjusting the lens.CONTROLSThe most basic controls (flash, timer etc.) are at your fingertips but this is true of nearly all cameras.  SLRs and some compacts tend to have a mode wheel that selects shooting modes but Nikon chose to keep the external interface simple and only the Nikon 1 mode wheel offers only 4: auto, Motion Snapshot, video, and Smart Photo (takes several photos and chooses the best one).  This is great for newbies and amateurs who prefer not to know of additional complexities but if you are used to SLRs and being able to rapidly switch between modes you will find this camera lacking.  The camera has all the usual modes and manual controls but to change them you must go down to a second level menu.  Thankfully the 4-way button is also a wheel which allows you to rapidly traverse the menu.  Still I would have preferred at least a dedicated button to instantly switch modes or a 5th option on the mode wheel that you could customize, or the ability to customize the F button which to me is under-utilized.One area in particular is very weak: manual focus.  First you have to get the camera into a manual mode, then you have to enable manual focus, and finally you must use the tiny paddle control in the corner to adjust the focus.  This is so cumbersome you will not want to do it except as a last resort.  That being said, it is rare that you will need it.  The auto-focus is very, very good!LENSESThe two primary lenses are 10-30mm and 30-110mm.  10-110 is effectively close to a typical SLR range of 18-200 due to the 2.7x crop factor of the Nikon 1.  I noticed the wide-angle (10mm) had notably less of a view field than I was used to but it is good enough for most shots.  Changing the lenses is as easy, perhaps easier, than an SLR due to the smaller size but with one issue: the rear caps must be lined up to attach.  I wish they would snap on or screw on like every other lens I have.  The retraction and locking button takes a little getting used to.  It is a good thing that the lens pulls back to make the camera more compact but it IS an extra step and one easily forgotten if you are in a hurry.  The camera does warn you if the lens is retracted but by then you have missed your shot.  The camera will also turn on automatically if you extend it--a nice feature if you train yourself to use it.  It does not currently have the ability to likewise shut off when retracted but maybe a future firmware update will allow this.  That being said, you can always just leave it extended.  The camera aggressively tries to conserve battery power by featuring a sleep mode and fairly fast on/off times so leaving it on while walking around is perfectly fine.BATTERY LIFEI would recommend an additional battery if you shoot more than 200 pictures a day.  The battery gauge has three segments which do not seem to be equal.  The first and second ones last a long time.  When you get down to the last segment there is little power left and the camera will shut down at any time and no warning.  There is no flashing red or other indicators of a very low battery like most SLRs.  You can usually squeeze one or two more shots out of it if you let it rest a bit but that's all.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon 1 J1 10.1 Digital Camera", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R3ORA6U830OFLE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is as advertized.

As this was going to be a \"bucket list trip\" - I was apprehensive about a cheaper 'point and shoot' and took a chance on the J1 with 2 'kit' lenses with a carry bag. I hauled a Canon VIXA video camera as a 'last ditch' backup but found it wan't needed for my 9 day tour of Beijing and Shanghai. My shots of the Great Wall and Tiananmen Square, Mao's tomb and the Shanghai waterfront came out as well as I wanted - certainly not \"L\" series glass - but certainly good enough for sharing with friends and family.

Let's face it.  The image quality of this little camera is inferior to its mirrorless interchangeable lens competitors.  BUT, I was willing to accept that because, in my opinion, if a camera is too slow or out-of-focus or you miss the shot, it really doesn't matter how good the image quality is.Well, all the reviews say the Nikon J1 has a fantastically-fast auto focus (in part due to its phase detection auto focus) as well as ultra-low shutter lag, especially when pre-focused, that rivals the best DSLRs.  With its small sensor, you also get correspondingly small lenses.  It seemed the perfect camera to capture life's events, most notably kids at ballet, swimming, tennis, gymnastics, you name it.  Kids are always moving, after all.What I found is that in bright light, the auto-focus is almost great.  It does have one big problem, and that is that it loves to focus on backgrounds.  If there is a fence or a wall or trees in the background, it will focus on that.  That is despite trying all the various focus settings and prefocusing right on the subject.  Another problem with the auto-focus is that once the light starts to drop, the auto-focus speed goes away.  In fact, due to the tiny sensor, the ISO goes to 3200, and the shutter speeds struggle to make 1/125 or 1/160 during bright afternoon sun, albeit with some shady trees.  This further blurs an already-moving subject.  Another problem with the auto-focus is in mixed bright/shady scenes.  The auto focus will almost always prefer to focus on the bright areas no matter what you do to coax it to focus on your subject which may be in the shade.The real disaster of this product is the poor shutter lag.  Measuring on a fixed computer screen, it is in fact around 0.07 or 0.10 or so seconds.  However, aside from this synthetic test, during real world shots, it is much slower and, worse-yet, highly variable.  I would guess that after shooting nearly a thousand shots, 80-90% were missed timing-wise and throw-away.  It was particularly frustrating because the LCD on the back would freeze and show the shot exactly as I had timed, but the actual picture was then some tenths to 1/4 second later.  In comparison, I tried my Canon Digital Elph on the same shots, and although the camera struggled big-time to keep up with the auto-focus, the shutter lag was so much better/consistent that after a few shots, I was nailing shots of hitting the ball at the point of contact.  I had never been able to come anywhere close to this with the Nikon J1.  I then tried my cell phone!  Still, I was able to get shots with better timing than the J1.Also, the 10fps capture is a joke.  It's more like 1 capture, then 1/3 to 1/2 sec later a few more.  The artificial shutter sound is 10fps -- so you think you're getting 10, but then you review the pictures, and you find the first one (late) and then maybe 1-3 more over the next second until the buffer fills.  I found that NOT using electronic HI mode resulted in more and better timed shots, but still maybe 3-4fps max and all missed shots if they are action.  The highest 30 and 60fps I did not bother with because the resolution is too poor.For me, the whole reason for this camera was to capture those moments in life to save forever.  This camera will not do it if you are at all taking shots of moving targets.  This camera would be fine shooting stills or buildings or smiling/posing people, but then so would just about any camera.  I do give it two stars because for still photography, it is a well-made camera that is much more compact than its competitors.  The reality is I will almost never carry our Nikon D7000 around with all the lenses and junk with it.  Thus, I will miss 100% of those moments because I'm not bringing \"luggage\" around with me everywhere I go.Up next, I will try the newly-announced Sony NEX-5R which has hybrid auto-focus (with phase detection).

I read every review here and was hesitant after reading a few of the horror stories about some experiences, espcecially low light settings because I like to shoot desert sunsets and sunrises. I took shots in the complete dark of night with just a slight bit of light to reflect off some shiny metal to get some contrast of pitch black and a point of light with no flash. I have to say I was impressed. The black was black. No snow or pixilation, or that foggy, cloudy mess where colors blend that looks like someone tried to touch up in photoshop. I shot in low light and bright light. Blacks are nice dark black, no grey tones and colors were vivid in bright light. In shadow areas of natural light some pics did seem a bit washed out depending if you were shooting from a shadow area or into an area with shadows. I'm not a pro, hell i'm not even an amateur. I'm just a hobbyist. So i'm not sure why alot of people have complaints about this camera.

No other compact camera will come close to this little box in ability to follow action (it CAN keep up with my 3 and 6 y.o. daughters, a feat shared in my experience only by the 3500AF module in my D300 SLR)- like to shoot raw and want to have a camera with no speed penalty for doing so- want to have it all in somewhat pocketable form (J1 with one of th ekit lenses (say 10-30) and 30-110 lens do fit into two of my jacket pockets)- realize that even a great small sensor is a small sensor, and do not expect to shoot landscapes with it and expect results that would rival dSLR output, especially at dusk- realize that even a great small sensor is a small sensor, and do not expect to shoot in dim lighting indoors with it and expect results that would really rival dSLR output- have basic understanding of photography and be prepared to set up camera so that the firmware problems can be worked around (i.e. learn what shutter-priority mode is and when to use it)As long, as you adhere to these rules of engagement, J1 delivers tons of great pictures in a very small package. Its' files are pleasure to work with, especially color-wise (I find it easier to get great colour out of J1 than out of D300). It's AF performance is amazing, and it happily churns out 5 frames per second in raw mode with no slowdowns and lengthy waits for writing. The only hardware problem - the battery performance. Fully charged J1 battery is good for ~2GB of video.As for the other stuff - do take time to read advice on the web as to how to set up J1 properly. I found lots of good tips in aforementioned RG's review, as well as in Thom Hogan's review ( [...] and [...]l ). Oh, and I see that his complete guide is out as well - another amazing resource.Update: I just uploaded 3 samples of what J1 is capable of.

You're basically talking about comparing a camera that was meant to sell for around $700 with ones meant to sell for $400 or less.  Image quality in terms of color rendition/accuracy, sharpness and noise, particularly under low-light conditions, is stunning compared to any point and shoot I've ever used (I've had about five now over the years, including Kodak, Olympus, Fuji and Panasonic).The small size and light weight (easily pocketable with the tiny 10mm fixed wide-angle lens) make this my \"go to\" camera for almost everything now.The overall build quality is top-notch in terms of look, finish, feel and handling--it is much nicer than most mirrorless cameras I looked at and worlds nicer than any point and shoot cameras I've seen--with a jewel-like quality and lots of precision-machined metal rather than molded plastic.The available lenses are of the same caliber and their small size and weight (particularly for the super-zooms) just brings a smile to my face as someone who once had a large (big, heavy) collection of lenses for a 35mm SLR.  Unfortunately the lens prices are not as inviting as the kit, but that's to be expected, as the lenses work across the entire Nikon 1 range and have not been discontinued as has this \"old model\" J1 body.The continuous auto-focus is very accurate and amazingly quick (there are times when you don't even notice it refocusing, it happens so fast)--very useful for video as well and not a common video feature on digital cameras.  As others have noted, at lower light levels the focus is slower, as the J1 switches between autofocus systems.  The power zoom lens offered in the Nikon 1 line, while pricey, is silent while zooming, focusing or reducing vibration, so you can pull zoom in videos without hearing any motor noise in the recording.  That's good as the camera does not have an external microphone jack but, really, video performance is pretty impressive for something that is not a camcorder!There are lots of things that could be improved in terms of ergonomics, features, etc., but the bottom line is, at this price, it doesn't really matter.  You simply can't take as good a picture with anything else at this price.  If you can afford to spend a lot more, there are certainly better choices.P.S.

Too long for a street photographer.-F button can't be customizable (it indicate the type of shoot. A waste of a button)-Flash syncro max is 1/60s and the camera doesn't accept external flash.-In Auto mode, the ISO that the camera selects when indoors or low light is too high (1600 to more) even so the flash is on producing noisy pictures. Well, this is a reason why people should shoot in M mode.-In Auto mode, there is no option to choose a particular scene to help the camera to choose the right parameters. Actually I have not tested in all scenarios if it does well or poorly because I don't shoot in A mode.-Manual focus system is very bad. Useless function.-A little heavy for the camera size and 1\" sensor.-It doesn't feel secure in hands and it doesn't feel well-built as an enthusiastic camera as Canon G series, Pana LX7 or Pentax Q.-No filters. I can't understand this omission.-No HDR-No filter NDJ1 has been made not for enthusiastic photographers if not to amateur people who want to upgrade their cheap compact system to some more capable (more IQ and interchangeable lenses). J1 should be the less enthusiastic camera in the mirrorless camera world (maybe with the Canon M). Even the Pentax Q is more functional. An enthusiastic camera is one that allows you to take photos quickly, secure, with shortcut buttons to the values of the camera, with an intuitive menu, sitting well in the hand and with a fast and accuracy performance. And the J1 has many limitations to fulfill that purpose.Suggested retail price was much overpriced ($650 with 10-30mm and $900 with 10-30 and 30-110mm) for the system.  It was reflected in that only hardcore Nikon users bought the camera at that time. The sales at $500 and $400 (for the one lens kit) don't seem interesting. Recently at $300 and $200 the camera is attractive to buyers. I bought the two lenses kit at $320 (64% of discount) and the one lens kit is selling for just $200 (69% of discount). At that price point, the camera is OK. For that, I value this camera with 3 stars. If the price would be $400 or more, one or two stars. With a little more money you can buy a Sony 3N or an Olympus EPM2, both much better in IQ, shooter experience (Oly >Sony) and lenses choices.Similar Products I Own::Pentax QCanon G15Panasonic LX7", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Jessica Griffith", "ReviewID": "R2NXL87WR2AWOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my husband this camera in red, and had to have one for myself, so I bought the white one.

I got a great deal on the camera, two lenses, memory card amd a Nikon Bag.The Nikon J1 camera is a great idea that needs more work for sure Believe me when I say it still has one big problem. The camera will blur motion in photos in most light conditions even after I appplied the firmware update to fix it from Nikon's website. I tried setting to aperture, shutter, and several other modes too, but still blurry photos. I think Nkon needs to do more with this design and find a way to unpdate the firmware correctly to stop this photo blur.For you photo takers out there that want to photograph children, pets, and sports be advised this may not be the camera for you right now.Pros:1.I love the design and it doeasn't feel cheaply made.2. Whe the pictures are not blurry they a great looking and almost as good as my Sony SLT camera in auto mode.Cons:1. The blurry pictures in low light mostly I mentioned above.2. The menu structure could be better, but I own a Sony Alpha so it isn't to complicated to navigate.I've got 90 days to return this camera, so I'm going to work with the settings and see if I can get the little blurry eyed monster to take better photos. I'll write another update later on this camera in aout two weeks.Update 12/9/2012I returned the Nikon J1 to the wharehouse club and bought a Sony NEX bundle.  I really didn't need to wait a month to update this review. The Sony NEX is a much better camera with better menus and control features. I can tell you I shot about a 100 pictures today with the Sony and not a one is blurry at all.The main reason I returned is I feel as though Nikon really didn't think the meneu control of camera's functions and get it right. There is a lot of possibilities with this camera line, but Nikon left the J2 unchanged which leads me to believe changes aren't coming anytime soon. What a waste for Nikon to think this design with all its quirks will sell with only changing the name from J1 to J2. Advanced camera users like me aren't going to like a lot of the cameras auto features at all, but many people will find the blurry pictures enough of a turn off. I must say I expected better from Nikon after using their DSLR models and their point & shoots too. My advice is if you want to take control of your cameras picture taking avoid this camera.

Nikon will probably come out with more capable professional cameras later in the compact system series. But for me it is perfect. I shoot for hobby. As long as I get the frame I framed, the way I expected, my job is done. I used traditional Nikon SLRs for a long time. Because, the amazing middle ground of compact system is a recent phenomenon. Besides, I won't use other brands than Nikon.Light weight is a big life saver. I can actually take it anywhere without thinking twice. And hence, the opportunity of getting an unexpected shot inceases big time.As far as the settings go, changing setting in this camera is not quick. Because they are menu driven on the screen. But they work well for whatever flexibility is given. Pictures are razor sharp. I recommend using a Nikon lens hood. I bought along with the camera. You will have much less frustration with flares, specially if you use a lens filer (like UV or NC). BTW, you should put on a protective lens filter before taking the first shot! Just my opinion to keep your mind at peace that you are not touching something on a pristine Nikkor lens.The built in intelligence of automatic subject detection and focus are as good or bad as any other camera. Because, you have a human mind and the camera has an electronic one, both often don't converge. Hence, the auto-area mode focus is not always helpful beyond landscapes. You want to change to spot.Unlocking the lens automatically switches on power which is a good thing. The less you have to fiddle wth the buttons the better.Closeups are good. There is no macro lens for 1 series yet (it is not a prefessional camera) but the small form factor lets you get good close-ups. That means, that most of your close picture needs can be satisfied with no problems. I tested it quite a bit.It is almost an understatement to say that this camera is fast. It is really fast for a camera at this price level. BTW, if you want to buy spare battery EN-EL20 type, go 3rd party for under 10 bucks instead of 40 from Nikon. Though I find the battery capacity very good. Note that I don't like to use the tiny flash that comes with J1. In fact, I am not a fan of flash photography other than using fill flash.

I can't take a good photo of my kids, on AUTOMATIC, without 10 tries telling them repeatedly to \"HOLD STILL.\"2. SO, if I change to 1/250 or higher, I can get a good shot, but only in GREAT lighting conditions. which bring us to #3..3. You can't take a good low light shot, on automatic, without using the flash (it won't auto-focus)4. But, the flash on this camera does not automatically go off!! (you have to click the button to \"raise\" it)5. And if you use the flash, you cannot have the shutter speed at 1/250!!!!  You're back to square one with a blurry photo.So, hear me (all professional photographers can silently tip-toe past):An average layman like myself cannot get a decent photo of their children (or anything moving) just turning on the camera and using it.See for yourself: I uploaded the first photo I took after taking this out of the box, charging battery and turning it on. See customer images on product page.Hear me!  In order to take a non-blurry shot of anything not static, you will have to turn on the camera and then CHANGE the shutter speed.However, now this is important:You cannot use the flash with a shutter speed of 1/250 !!!So, if you purchase the Nikon 1, you will ONLY be taking non-blurry photos of your children in bright light (and this is after changing shutter speed). You will not be getting any decent shots of children otherwise.As a mother, I need to be able to turn on the camera and get the shot when my baby is starting to stand, without changing the settings. I can do this on my DSLR. There is absolutely no way on the Nikon 1, that you will QUICKLY get the shot. The Nikon 1 sounds so appealing because of the claims about how fast it is! This is why I bought it, and really wanted to love it. But you will not get the shot FAST, if you have to change settings first.  And if it's not the brightest light, you will need to turn on the flash, but that is an added step, and usually you will not have realized that you needed to turn it on until you are staring down at the dark photo you just took of that sweet but foregone smile. Not to mention you can't have a fast shutter speed with the flash turned on, so you had better hope that baby enjoys holding perfectly still after dusk!!Got it?Now I understand I am probably not the primary intended user for the Nikon 1 (someone who mostly just wants automatic settings). So the reason for the 2 star rating is this: There is no way Nikon should ever be charging this hefty pricetag on a camera that simply cannot take good low-light shots. Right? I am not saying this is a terrible camera. I am sure someone who knows what they are doing could use this bad boy proficiently (you know, in good light!) BUT. $750 for a non-DSLR camera that has irritating navigation, requires excellent lighting, and too big to put in a pocket?  There are so many options out there. In my opinion, this is simply not a good choice for the money.What I don't understand, is who the target audience is. If you are looking to adjust settings manually, for this price you should be considering a DSLR. If you were simply leery of the size of a DSLR, please realize this is not a small enough camera that you will be putting it into your pocket. You will still be \"lugging\" it around. And for the compromised quality (of a DSLR) and difficult navigation, I just don't think you would be satisfied. Of course, just my opinion.So, for me, my solution is to keep my DSLR, for when I need the nice photos. And then purchase a quality point and shoot (I have a Canon S100 on the way) for when I am going somewhere that I don't want to lug around the DSLR, or I want to take a video.

I'm looking for a compact camera to replace my wife's Panasonic DMC-ZS3 point-and-shoot, so I figured I'd give the J1 a try at a local store. To replace my wife's ZS3, the J1 has to take better pictures than the ZS3 both indoors and out, while in fully automatic point-and-shoot mode.On my first trip to the store, I took many pictures of my kids running around in the aisles of the store. I was impressed at how fast the J1 could shoot without slowing down and how quickly it appeared to autofocus on my cavorting children. But when I got home and uploaded the pictures to my computer, I was shocked to see that the pictures were all black, underexposed by more than four stops. WTF! The exif showed that the camera had been set to shutter priority with 1/3200 shutter and I didn't notice it in the store because all the pictures looked good on image review. So clearly whatever the J1 is showing on the LCD immediately after you take a picture is NOT the picture it saved on the SD card. Yes it's partly my fault for not checking the settings but the camera shares a significant amount of blame for (incorrectly) telling me that my pictures were good. Strike one.On my second trip to the store, I checked all the camera settings twice and put it in full auto. My kids couldn't attend, so I took pictures of things and people in the store. When I uploaded the pictures to the computer, I was pleased that the exposure was acceptable but disappointed that nearly every picture was washed out from what appeared to be flare from the overhead lights in the store (see attached images). Yes, the overhead lights were bright, but surely not bright enough to ruin all the pictures? Strike two.On my third trip to the store, I brought along a DMC-ZS3 compact camera, an LX3 premium compact, and a GH1 micro four-thirds with the 20mm f1.7 lens. I set all cameras to full auto, except the GH1 which I set to aperture priority f4.0 to simulate the GF3/GX1 14-42mm kit zoom lens. Surely the J1 would be able to best the ZS3 and LX3 with their much smaller sensors and older technology. But that was not to be the case... Unlike the other three cameras, the J1 had difficulty focusing on any of the subjects I chose; it was easily distracted by reflections and who knows what else. The slightest hint of backlighting caused the entire J1 image to be washed out, much more so than any of the other cameras. The resulting pictures are awful, worse even than the ZS3. Take a look at noirist's \"Camera Test\" set on flickr.Rob Galbraith has shown that it is possible to pull reasonable images out of the J1 outdoors at low ISOs, but my experience suggests that it is not easy to do so at higher ISOs, and certainly not in full auto. The electronic shutter of the J1 can cause severe image quality degradation at high ISOs for even mildly back-lit subjects. The very quick autofocus is only useful if you are willing to manually control the location of the autofocus point because the J1 does a poor job of choosing what to focus on in the presence of reflections and backlighting. Like the Nikon DSLRs, you must continually fiddle with all the J1 camera settings (autofocus mode, metering mode, exposure compensation, focus point, etc.) to get the best images. It's a lot of work for what? Even an old point-and-shoot superzoom can take better indoor pictures than the J1 with no effort at all, and if you're going to work that hard to get reasonable images from the J1 you might as well bring along a DSLR and get some truly outstanding images! Worst of all, the image review (which can't be turned off) is a complete lie. You can take horrible pictures with the J1 and not realize it until you get home and upload them to your computer.Bottom line: an amateur photographer looking to upgrade from a point-and-shoot would do better with micro four thirds, like a G3 or GX1. Those camera bodies with the new 14-42mm X series zoom are smaller than the J1 with any of its kit lens, and their sensors are twice as large (and hence capture twice as much light with better subject isolation). They offer many more native lenses of all sizes, speeds, and focal lengths, and Panasonic's intelligent auto \"iA\" system will let a novice take better pictures with much less work or skill than they can with the J1. A photographer willing and able to extract the best images out of the J1 will be disappointed when they realize they could have gotten much better pictures out of a Nikon 5100 or other DSLR for the same amount of work.Postscript 01/20/2012. Dpreview just published their review of the J1 and they agree - the J1 is neither for enthusiasts nor novices. \"Enthusiasts will be disappointed by Nikon's focus on beginners, and that's fine - the 1 System really isn't designed for them.

I have to say that after 8 months I love it though and I recommend the package with the zoom lens. If I want to buy the lens now it's still $250 as an add-on. The camera works very well on 'auto' setting but I have taught myself how to play with the aperture and shutter speed settings, which is very easy and fun to do once you get the hang of it. I bought this instead of the similar Sony NEX3 or similar version because this had a built in flash and others did not. However, this camera works so well in low light that I hardly use the flash, ever. The battery life is very good and the included charger works well. The zoom on the basic/included camera lens is good but not great which is why I now need the zoom lens. I also wish it had come with some sort of flat or pancake lens b/c it definitely won't fit in your pocket with the included lens and you can't take photos with it off, so if you really want the compactness of a point and shoot camera, this isn't it; it has a little bit of bulk to it.

And on the trip it took amazing pictures; right out of a post card you would think. BUT after the charm of having a really nice camera wore off I started to notice it's faults.First you better plan on taking pictures with it out in the sun or a really well lit area because otherwise the pictures do not come out good at all. Will say though when that is not the case the pictures come out amazing. And after having it a few months and tweaking with the settings I figured out how to make the pictures come out just OK in low light settings and learned the strengths/weaknesses to work around them.So I was ok with this and was still loving the camera for what it could do but then this happened. On Halloween night we're at a party and notice the flash isn't firing; odd so assumed maybe I had tweaked with a setting. After messing with it a bit finally realized that the $600 camera I had bought a mere 5 months ago had a dead flash. That's right within just 5 months a critical piece of the camera was dead and believe me if you're in low light settings without the flash you might as well use your camera phone.Contacted Nikon and within a few days they have me send it to their repair center; having me pay for shipping of course; and it has now been over a month. Just with a status of \"PARTS ON HOLD\" and no further contact. I'm sorry but for dropping $600 on a first gen product of theirs they need to do better than this and I am sorely disappointed in their service. I've missed Thanksgiving holiday and now most likely Christmas with an opportunity to take amazing pictures with my family.So take what you will from this review.UPDATE: 1/10/2013So here is the full history.- flash broke 11/01/2012- submitted repair request on 11/04/2012- after some back and forth told camera had to be sent in for repair on 11/10/2012- camera received by Nikon on 11/16/2012 and pretty soon placed in \"Parts On-Hold\"- contacted again on 12/20/2012 since there was no further communication or change- told on 12/22/2012 that a brand new camera would be sent due to the wait- still no status change or further contact as of 1/10/2012- contacted service by phone and told that they were waiting for a shipment and should get it by next weekYes you have read that right; 2 full months after being sent to Nikon and I still have nothing in my hands that I paid for.

Also I've learned that Nikon limits their repairs to 22 stores in the entire US, or you have to ship it off for repairs. The quoted repair was $180.

Its small size is its great virtue, especially when traveling under circumstances where schlepping a 30 lb bag of camera bodies, lenses and other paraphernalia would be inconvenient or worse. But it's smallness also means that its controls are tiny and not always intuitive to use. For example, it took me a while to figure out manual focussing (not at all explained in the manual), because there is no focusing ring on the lens. This only means that the camera takes a while to get used to. Also, the absence of a viewfinder required a bit of getting used to.  And there is no hot shoe for flash.  Other idiosyncrasies include a blue cast in shadows and more noise than I am used to with my other, large-sensor cameras, especially but not only at high ISOs. The cast is easily dealt with in Photoshop or other color- correction programs, and noise can also be controlled in post-processing. That said, the resulting photos are very good and often spectacular. The lenses are exceedingly sharp, the anti-vibration permits sharp hand-held pictures with the tele-zoom fully extended at shutter speeds as slow as 1/100, and the sensor is large enough to allow for superb prints as large as 13 x 19 (as large as my printer will produce) and probably larger.

Results are wow!I am a Canon fan, really a fan, but this Nikon has blown me away.Shoots like a full size DSLR, but carries like a point and shoot, which gives an added benefit of different venues that won't allow cameras with \"detachable\" lenses.  The size alone has allowed for concert shooting.After saying the above, be aware of a few \"quirks\" of the J1...many lightweight plastic parts, especially the memory card and battery slot, which worries me.  There is no viewfinder, which I prefer to shoot through.  If you do flash photography (not a priority for me) the flash is not better than a point and shoot.

I bought it so that I have a small camera that is easy to carry around if I do not want to drag along my bigger Nikon single lens reflex camera. The biggest negative for me is the lack of an eyepiece view finder (the more expensive v1 version has this).  This means that you have to hold the camera out away from your eye so that the camera tends to move as you take the picture.  The camera in autoexposure mode tends to pick a slow shutter speed so that pictures may be blurred unless a tripod is used.  I avoid this by using the aperture priority mode at iso 400 or less so that I can change the aperture (lens opening) to make sure that the shutter speed is fast enough to avoid blurred images. Also the camera has an image stabilization mode so that blurry pictures are less likely at slower shutter speeds.  The 10-30 mm lens focuses down to around 8 inches so close to macro images may be obtained.  Some people may not like that the depth of field is large so it may be difficult to keep the background out of focus if, for instance, the foreground is in focus.  There are a lot of other small, mirrorless cameras now that the experts have tended to give better reviews than the Nikon 1 J1, but you should be able to get a lot of excellent pictures from this camera if you are careful about the exposure speeds.

I can get many usable pictures with my D3100 using a comparable f lens in this lighting and no flash.  The flash also leaves a bit to be desired as well.  It's not very powerful and just leaves things looking sterile, and since you have no option to add one, you kind of are stuck.  I also did not feel as though the screen gave an accurate representation of what the images would look like later.  It seemed to be acceptable, but missed obvious blur that clearly was there.  This surprised me, since the screen seemed so clear...At this price point, I'd HIGHLY recommend the D3100 kit with 18-55mm.

I will say that I am a camera-addict (I currently have a Nikon D5100 (love it), Nikon D7000 (love it), and Nikon D90 (love it but it is being neglected a lot lately because of the D7000 and D5100.)  I also have various other point & shoots, etc.  I was drawn to the sleek white version of this camera - but fought the urge to puchase it for quite some time.  Then, I read an article in my Outdoor Photography magazine that had a spread on the merits of these new mirror-less cameras.... so I decided to purchase the Nikon 1 J1 kit that came with a 10 gig SD card and a nice & sturdy red leather case.  I have taken about 100 photos with it so far, and I am impressed.  It is ZIPPY FAST ... light and easy to use.  I bought a 30-100mm lens as well to go with it.  It isn't equal to my full size Nikon dSLRs (and certainly doesn't replace one) - but it does a very decent job and is a good small camera to cart around when I don't want to lug around my full size dSLRs.  I was amazed how fast the camera snaps shots - it certainly puts any of the regular point and shoots to shame.

Piekosz \"Human Being\"", "ReviewID": "R1W5MZUMAD4QBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon J1 takes great photos.  The color is rich and deep.  You can snap off as many photos as you want in a series, and pick out the best one later, one without anybody's eyes closed, say.  It's compact yet solid; the menu is easy to navigate, the options are limited, though, if you like to tweak around with your camera.  There are four main settings, the other three being 'best picture possible', which really does take the best possibility, although the lag time after is quite long, so you can't take another photo for several beats, 'motion snapshot' which i haven't hardly used since the camera takes such great motion snapshots on the regular setting, and movie.I love my SLR's pictures, but it's a pain to carry around.  The J1 is easy to carry around, even with the larger 30-110 lens, you just sling it around your shoulder and you don't even notice it there.  I don't know much about mirrorless, other than the light isn't reflected through a mirror and goes straight to forming the image, but the J1 takes fast, fabulous photos.  The color is really rich and details crisp.  Depth of field is thick, the image sensors do a good job focusing on what you want to focus on.  The interchangeable lenses give a variety of options, the 10-30 lens being your workhorse lens, and the 30-110 for outside.  They are easy to change in and out.  The flash is a bit goofy; it pops up out of the body of the camera on a telescope.  Which is where you hold the camera, so your finger blocks it.  The camera does a decent to good job of indoors light, if you are going to use the camera mainly for indoors you might want to look elsewhere, the flash is the weakest aspect.What I was looking for in a camera was something like a reporter's camera.  My dream camera is a Leica but that remains a dream.  The J1 fit all my camera requirements: can carry it with you without being a hassle, takes quality photos, interchangeable lenses, fast.  So I could take photos of Spider Man for my job as a reporter for the Daily Bugle.  The J1 takes great photos, very rapidly.  You don't lose much in the way of image-quality from an SLR, at least not to my unprofessional eyes.

He's very good with cameras though I am not. I'm pretty much a point and shoot kind of girl but he figured I could take some higher quality pictures of my kids with relative ease without having to lug around a big camera. I like the premise of the camera however if I were to pick a camera myself I probably would get something even more simplistic than this. It definitely was not worth the price for someone like me. I'm sure if you're more advance with cameras you would love this camera. However my biggest complaint is I find it hard to take a picture that are not blurry. I don't know if I have the wrong settings or what but others have looked at it and not been able to fix the problem. I've found if I'm taking a picture of a non-moving object the first couple will be blurry. But if I take my time and push the button to take the picture part-way several times it can take a beautiful picture that is crystal clear. However when I'm trying to get my kids they're usually moving and I don't get the same result. I also don't like how long it takes to actually take the picture once I hit the button. With kids I want something nearly instant because it seems like I'm always missing my shot. My camera came with a second lens but I've never used it.

Its list price is way to expensive, its black Friday blow out price may be OK for this.Advanced users who don't mind leaning a menu system and understand the use of Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority.They will be able to get control over the camera.Its loaded with odd features that might be fun but will get little use after the gimmick wares off.  Short bursts of slow motion  A mode that takes a shot than appends slow motion with music to it.. Really?  Who asked for that?Who will not like this camera.. anyone who has ever used a basic digital camera and was hoping for a better quality upgrade.  And wants some moderate control.We have not been out taking pictures yet and I am trying to decide if I can return it after the kid named it.One of the useful features for the intermediate photographer that Phone cameras to DSLRS have is Scene modes.  Beach, Sports, Portrait.  Macro etc.  This camera is devoid of them.. In an auto mode it will choose the scene and tell you what it thinks .. but you can't over-ride it.If I sound grumpy.. I am teaching photography to 5th and 6th graders including my daughter and got her this camera for the class.  OMG I can't teach her to think about the shot and choose a scene mode. And the class is not geared towards more advanced camerasI would love to get into the  Aperture and Shutter speeds more.. but most of the kids come to class with P&S; and scene modes so I have adapted the class to them.There is no INBETWEEN mode for people to move from full AUTO to Making more controlled choices.The Nikon lens may be fine.. the Sensor may be fine and the still image tests I looked at before getting the camera were good.But usage wise this camera is a USER INTERFACE DISASTER...  I see now why the Sony NEXs even older models cost soo much and several sellers were blowing these J1s out at under $200... It is a design mess.UPDATE:  I would like more control as stated above... But my 10 year old is loving the camera.  Just the right size and it makes decent choices about which \"scene mode\" it should use.  I can get at more user controls and will start teaching her that.  The image quality is great.  I would buy a Sony APC Alpha 6000 or Alpha $5000 if this was its original price.

I purchased this camera to photograph my work and completely rely on images for future sales. My beef with the camera is the colors and tone look great in the view finder but I can rarely get the camera to capture the image that way regardless of settings and mode. As soon as the image is taken and it shows the review, it looks like a totally different scene. It's always darker or washed out and green and rarely close to what it actually is. It was a refurbished camera so maybe it was returned as defective for the above reasons and the factory checked it and saw that it powered up and took images and called it good? I really don't know but my iPhone takes better images in terms of color and tone. The only thing that has impressed me is that I can take a picture in a very dark room without a flash and the camera pulls out the image. For someone who would rather rely on lighting rather than a flash and doesn't mind messing with the color in PhotoShop it might be ok but for the amount of money, it should be able to take a nice photo. I would have given it 2.5 stars if I could as I do like the function, look, and feel of the camera.

At the current price of $499 with the 10-30mm and 30-110mm lens as well as the memory card and case makes it worth it.  But for the old list price of $650 with just the 10-30mm lens and $249 for the $30-110mm lens, I believe that it was way too expensive and would only give it a 3 star at most.  Needed to replace my old point and shoot that was dying.  Wanted something better than a point and shoot but smaller than my D700 to carry around for smaller outings.The camera focuses fast and the pictures come out pretty good as long as you keep the ISO at 800 and under.  3200 ISO has way too much noise, due to the smaller sensor size.  1600 ISO is OK but you will notice a bit more noise.  On my D700 you can go much higher with the ISO and it still looks really decent.  There is slight barrel distortion on the 10-30mm lens as well as some slight darkening around the corners.  They already have a lens profile for it in Lightroom that will take care of the problem.  Overall the picture quality is nice and sharp and has good color.  It's also pretty fast and can shoot 5fps with raw + jpg, which is pretty impressive since that as fast as my D700 without the additional battery pack.I had just purchased the camera last month and one thing I noticed was that the firmware on the camera and lens where out of date.  There was already two newer versions of the firmware out for the camera and one for the lens.  Make sure you update your camera and lens to the latest firmware, it may fix some of the blurry picture issues that people have been complaining about in the camera.One thing that I don't really care for it is in the scene select mode, you can't select the range of the auto-ISO setting so it will end up using ISO 3200 on your shots.  If you use a different mode like P,A,S,M then you can adjust the auto-ISO to a lower setting.Another issue is that there is no auto pop up flash.  You have to manually raise the flash before taking a picture.  They should had a setting to auto pop up the flash for more novice users.  This fine for a more advanced user but for someone who is less familiar will have a harder time to remember when to turn it on, especially in difficult lighting situation.  I've have always used SLRs where you had to manually turn on the flash so this is not a problem for me.  But for my wife it's a different story.  And this camera is mainly for her.  Also the pop up flash looks kind of flimsy, just hope it will last.  Would have preferred a flash built onto the front of the camera.Battery life is so-so.  Make sure to get an extra battery.  It doesn't last that long.  I was reading online that it always has the VR on at all times as opposed to only on when you depress the shutter button.  So I'm sure this causes it to drain much faster.  Also I noticed that the VR is set to active by default.Video is not very good at low light situations.  For, indoor shooting, a lot of times it looks way too dark on screen.  It's much worse than my old Sony camcorder.  In bright light the video looks good.  Plus you can also take pictures while your are filming video.  They have slow motion shooting but it's limited to such a short time frame so it's really not all that useful.  Plus the resolution on the slow motion is much lower.  It's more of a gimmick than anything else.Overall it's a decent camera with certain limitations.  I wanted a smaller camera that you can use like a point and shoot but with a bit more control and better low light picture quality that you would get with a slightly larger sensor.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb Camera", "Author": "Brian Chabalik", "ReviewID": "R2T73WFPUBVLG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Camera - Don't be fooled by the \"low\" megapixel rating - This camera takes exceptional quality shots with an extremely fast shutter speed.

There is even a special mode that takes 20 shots in quick succession and selects 5 to keep and 1 as a favorite. Great for capturing the moment when the foot hits the ball or other action events.image quality - the image quality is excellent, including when printing a full page (8 x 10). Larger may be fine too, but I haven't done that (yet).portability - the camera is relatively compact (for its features) and lightweight.

I would buy it just for video and speed of the camera, focus is very good.Its in the same price range with sony nex-5n and I've used both cameras. both cameras have their own advantages, but I would take nex-5n if i had to pick one.

WHY pay an extreme premium???", "Author": "7 \"7\"", "ReviewID": "R2MVAOR10O72S2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I spent Tuesday, November 29, 2011 shooting/comparing a Nikon 1 to my Lumix TS3 and Nikon D5100 and on Wednesday, December 7, 2011 I went to Best Buy down here and bought a red ;) Nikon 1 and an MFT-sensored Lumix GF3 (because the GF3 was on sale for only $399.99) so I could get to the bottom of this whole Nikon 1/mid-sized sensor thing.This review is being written by a very active photographer that has been shooting professional film and digital photo gear for almost 30 years with extensive experience with PNS and Nikon DSLRs who has spent 9 serious days and many snapshooting days with the Nikon 1 and has reviewed the photos at 100% resolution on a calibrated 27\" computer monitor. I absolutely appreciate the size and convenience that PNS cameras offer and currently own 9 PNS cameras, 5 35mm SLRs, 4 DSLRs and a Pentax 67. I am definitely NOT some snooty pro that shuns anything non-DSLR or non-pro nor am I some beginner with stars in my eyes or schmuck that doesn't know cameras or what he is talking about. I love my PNS cameras and am intimately familiar with them and came to own them after thorough comparison and experience. I rarely use my pro bodies and opt for my Nikon D5100 or Lumix TS3 nearly all the time.The Nikon 1 body is pretty solid and the lens does have a metal mount. My 1j1 with 10-30mm lens weighs 396.6g without strap and the GF3 weighs 435.7g without strap. My D5100 weighs 830.5g without strap and a Nikon P7100 weighs 395g, a Canon G12 weighs 355g and a Canon SX10 weighs 600g (P7100, G12 and SX10 weight is according to DPReview). The 10-30mm lens zooms rather smoothly for an inexpensive lens, about on par with a Nikon DX 18-55mm VR.The GF3's body is nice and solid but its lens feel is very disappointing. VERY plasticky with a plastic mount and zooming is jumpy particularly going from tele to wide. I can only hope that it will break in and smooth out but I've had modest success with cheap lenses improving over time. But it has a manual focus ring! :) Unfortunately you have to go into the Focus Menu and select Manual Focus before it does anything. :(Generally, the GF3's images tend to be a bit cool and underexposed and the Nikon 1's are a bit warm and overexposed. Contrast is better in the Nikon 1. I believe these issues could be corrected by dialing in some adjustments and then leaving them alone. The GF3's image has better to much better dynamic range than the Nikon 1's when flashing a modestly backlit subject. Dynamic range between the Nikon 1 and Lumix GF3 is similar in strong sunlight.At the pixel level the Nikon 1 is a bit sharper and more contrasty than the Lumix GF3 and textural detail and fine gradation render better on the Nikon 1 than on the Lumix GF3. It has been my experience, these are lens characteristics and likely should speak for the lenses involved (1 Nikkor 10-30mm and Lumix 14-42mm) rather than the sensors. The Nikon 1 also has better high ISO performance than the Lumix GF3, however it is still no match for a DSLR at high ISO. De-magnifying away from pixel level to \"fit screen\" magnifications of around 35%, sharpness and ISO noise are essentially indistinguishable.It is rather frustrating shooting these cameras in Auto Everything. I can't tell you how hard this is for me to not make constant adjustments. There is no camera in existence that actually does a good job ALL on its own. I'm trying to resist adjusting settings for the sake of this review but when I can't help it, the GF3 is WAY easier to navigate settings, customizations and adjustments. However, the GF3's Manual Exposure mode is terrible as you have to access a menu to change f-stop. What? MENU? It sucks when you have to press a button to switch from shutter to aperture, but to have to access a menu to switch between the two makes Manual Mode pretty much useless on the GF3 unless you are shooting landscapes or other stationary subjects with patience matching or exceeding yours. I don't like the Nikon 1's ergonomics for Manual Mode (or anything else), but at least aperture and shutter are both readily accessible with no menu or button presses.I had an outing in which I compared the 1j1, Lumix GF3, ZS7, TS3 and TS2. I put a tripod plate on each of them and just popped 'em all on and off the tripod and used Program or \"Standard Auto.\" I didn't use Nikon's Auto Scene Mode because it is hopelessly terrible and wasted space in any camera. Nor did I use Lumix's iA (Intelligent Auto) mode because it throws in a bunch of processing and also because it's pretty far from intelligent. Again, wasted space in cameras. It pains me that Lumix wasted a physical button on the GF3 for iA! That could have been a programmable Fn button. But no. It's a wasted button. At least you can program it so that it takes a long push to activate so you don't accidentally wind up in what amounts to \"Garbage Mode.\"The Nikon 1's collapsible lens gets downright frustrating in very little time. The release button must be pressed ALL the way in or release is sketchy or even scary. I have often thought \"OH, I've broken it this time!\" when I open the lens in a rush. I'm sure many of these lenses will fail because this poor lens lock is destined to break. I consider it a design flaw and Nikon really should do a recall or at the very least comp(limentary) the repair. Many shots are missed in the transition from collapsed to functional states. Leaving the lens in its functional state all the time is scary and it just feels like you're tempting fate by doing so.The Nikon 1's dramatic focus/focus tracking claims are exaggerated and Single Point Single Focus mode still returns the best focus results. It struggles to obtain focus and fails regularly in dim light or darkness even with its AF Assist Illuminator active. I was trying to photograph a friend who was lit by dim ambient street light and a single candle light at an outdoor bistro and the camera simply could not obtain focus. I had to focus on the candle (which was the same distance from the focal plane as her face) and then recompose the shot and then fire. This is a shot a DSLR would have had no trouble with and likely wouldn't have even needed its AF Assist Illuminator for. I also find that when I'm shooting my cats in front of a window screen that the Nikon 1 tends to focus on the screen instead. This is a common theme I am finding with the Nikon 1. It seems to look for linear patterns near the subject if the subject is not well-lit, contrasty or itself of linear pattern. Rather than do its best with your subject, it hunts for something easier to lock onto. A DSLR in Single Point or 3D Continuous Focus mode and not in Live View will track a subject and maintain focus better than a Nikon 1. I don't know if Nikon specifically claims otherwise, but that was my observation.The Nikon 1v1 is a paradox in which the requirement of an external flash would suggest it is targeted at serious photographers though its sole flash \"choice\" is severely underpowered for an external flash (exactly 2/3 as powerful as a Nikon D5100's internal POP-UP flash). Further perplexing is that neither Nikon 1 has exposure bracketing. The camera's ergonomics leaves WORLDS to be desired by even hobbyists, let alone serious to expert photographers.If you know much about the 1j1 already, let me clear up one of the elephants in the living room; YES, its popped-up flash IS as flimsy and scary-looking as it appears in pictures. It is seriously so bad that I'm scared to use it because one has to baby it pushing its OFF-CENTER mass back into the camera. Make sure you push it down from the left/port side (as seen from rear of camera). If you just nonchalantly pop it back down the way you normally would some other pop-up flash, you realistically could break it off.While we're on the topic of flash, the Lumix GF3 flash's bottom segment can be pulled back (halfway closed) so you can bounce off the ceiling. Kinda neat! Would be really nice if it could hold this position on its own. Your subject will need to be near and/or ISO high to bounce with the internal flash, but it's possible and the results are as would be expected from a bounce. Nice GF1, GF2, GF3 and GX1 perk.The Nikon 1 is a camera that requires just as much attention and adjustment as any other camera to get properly exposed, properly-focused images but it takes more effort to pay that attention and make those adjustments. It has the second-worst ergonomics I've ever used in any camera regardless of price and venturing out of \"auto everything all the time\" takes too long and is too laborious and often frustrating, particularly with \"fleeting moment\" photos. If your cat is on his back and super-cute, but you KNOW he's about to roll over, forget it. Just pop the flash (on a 1j1) if necessary, press the button and deal with it in Photoshop. You'll miss the shot if you try to install the flash on a 1v1 and/or change Exposure Mode and/or D-Lighting and/or Focus Mode and/or Picture Control and/or any such item. Making 1 or 2 settings changes on a DSLR can be nearly instantaneous or done within a couple seconds. The same adjustments on a Nikon 1 could take as much as 15-30 seconds. Eons in relative terms and the difference between getting the shot and missing the shot.Frankly, the Nikon 1, particularly the 1v1, is an oversized and vastly overpriced PNS camera whose great parts should be put into a serious compact camera like the Nikon P7100, hence creating the Nikon C7000 instead of being wasted on a fashion camera that doesn't even have any form of grip whatsoever. Its images are very slightly better than a Lumix TS3's and ZS7's, goes back and forth vs. a Lumix GF3 and is NOWHERE near as good as a Nikon D5100's. For anyone in the real world (\"real world\" = \"fill screen\" which is roughly 25%-35% monitor magnification, paper prints 12\"x18\" and smaller, canvas giclee prints 20\"x30\" and smaller) not literally making really big prints and/or substantial crops on a very regular basis, PNS cameras will yield equally good results. And if you ARE making really big prints and/or substantial crops on a very regular basis, don't kid yourself, a DSLR is DEFINITELY something you should step up to as people this serious about photography will be exponentially better-served with a real camera with dramatically better image quality and real lens and lighting choices.If one MUST get one of these mid-sized sensor mirrorless cameras, I'd suggest the Lumix GX1 as the hands-down mid-sized sensor ergonomics winners (by a huge margin!) with \"as good as but different\" image quality as a Nikon 1 or I'd suggest the Lumix GF2 and slightly less the GF3 for relatively exceptionally good ergonomics and \"as good as but different\" image quality as a Nikon 1. Or, based on reviews and NOT my own experience, the Olympus PEN line or Fuji X10. I would recommend against the Sony NEX as it is the only camera I have ever used with worse ergonomics than the Nikon 1. However, the NEX-5n's sensor is worlds better than the Nikon 1's. Particularly intriguing to me is the upcoming Canon G1X (This is NOT a typo. Lumix has the GX1 and Canon has the G1X) with its larger-than-4/3 sensor and fixed 28-112 equivalent f/2.8-5.8 lens.I would still recommend against this type of camera for ANYONE. These cameras barely if at all deliver on the promise of more portability than a DSLR and the Nikon 1's claim of DSLR-caliber images is a blatant lie and falls WAY short of such a lofty statement. Their images are LITERALLY virtually indistinguishable in the real world from any quality PNS camera. And their ergonomics are essentially identical to the average PNS. In the case of the Nikon 1 and Sony NEX, ergonomics are WORSE than the average PNS.I really wanted the Nikon 1 to be \"the photographer's camera when going light.\" It is truly extremely far away from that! If you're a Leicaphile looking for a cool toy, you're gonna be REAL disappointed with the Nikon 1.Nikon threw a fishing lure out there to appeal to iPhone users/fashionistas who are more gadget-fashion-conscious and menu-driven and PNS shooters BY FAR than to real photographers or those who genuinely are concerned with GETTING the shot or image quality. Even iPhone users/fashionistas balked at the ridiculous price for a toy camera that is actually available, I kid you not, in pink. Hence, the immediately-slashed prices.If you need portability, get a pocketable PNS like a Lumix TS3 or Nikon AW100, both waterproof and shockproof with non-extending lenses. Or for non-tough cameras with extending lenses; a Lumix ZS7 or ZS10 or Nikon S8200 or S9100 or Canon S95 or S100.I just got a Canon S100 and I have to tell you, it's been a little while since I've had such a \"WOW\" experience in cameras. I HIGHLY suggest you check one out. Reviews out there are mixed on it but I don't care about the reviews. I have one (and its predecessor the S95) and I've been shooting it. It produces MUCH better image quality than the already very good S95. The S100's image feel is similar to the Nikon 1's in that it is very saturated and rich. I call this \"juicy.\" Its dynamic range is fantastic and the S100 has easily and instantly positioned itself as my favorite PNS camera to date and I plan on selling off most of my PNS cameras now. All I need for non-DSLR cameras now are my Canon S100 and Lumix TS3. In all honesty, the S100's image feel is arguably my favorite of ANY camera. Yes, including my DSLRs. Now, I'm not saying that at the pixel level the S100 can hold up vs. DSLRs for grain/noise, edge detail or other pedantic idiosyncrasies that will never matter in a shot not being turned into a billboard. It can't. But for real life prints (16x20 and maybe larger) and easily fill-screen magnifications, it is a very lush looking image that I find EXTREMELY satisfying.I would take a Canon S100 over a Nikon 1 any day. I like its image feel more, its ergonomics are WORLDS better and it is a VERY small and light camera that can EASILY fit in my jeans front pocket and it has a 24-120mm F2.0-5.9 lens that is super colorful, contrasty and quite sharp, though 24mm has lots of distortion.Visit Amazon's Canon S100 page and view the customer images.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B005MTME3U/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allTons of beautiful juicy images. And easily-shot too. Check the Nikon 1 J1's page on Amazon.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B005OGQXJW/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allThere are only 2 images; 1 of a customer's J1 captioned that it can't take a picture of itself and one of a warehouse ceiling stating the camera has trouble focusing. Amazon's V1 page has not a single customer image...I'm calling it right here, right now. The Canon S100 is THE smaller-than-DSLR camera to own. Period. And compared to a Nikon 1, it's dirt cheap. That's my take. Now if only they would paint the S100 in Nikon 1 J1 candy red... :)If you want a rangefinder camera that's substantially more portable than a DSLR and pocketable in loose pockets (i.e. slacks, but not jeans) or a modest purse, get a Nikon P7100 or Canon G12. Both the P7100 and G12 are lighter, more compact, have faster lenses with more to dramatically more zoom range, built-in flash and VASTLY (I cannot stress this enough; VASTLY) superior ergonomics.The Nikon 1, despite the potential of its good sensor, fast and good image processing and superb Live View simply can't materialize its potential into a camera that consistently captures exceptional images because of truly egregiously flawed physical ergonomic and menu design that so completely gets in the way of making necessary adjustments that many pictures simply are missed. Its poor focusing in anything other than bright light costs further shots still and at night it is almost completely unusable even in Single Point Single Focus with AF Assist Illuminator active. It is either a camera that must be relegated to situations where time can be spent to set up a shot (like in a studio or with patient subjects/landscapes) or as an auto everything all the time camera. There are tons of better cameras for the former situation at the same price or less and it is not very good in the latter situation and is no better than cameras that cost a fraction of its price there.I'm sure there will be those who love the Nikon 1 and I'm happy for everyone who finds something they love. But I don't love the Nikon 1. I don't even like it. To me, it really isn't worth owning at any price. Even if I was given one for free, I would never use it.I am rating this camera only 2 stars because of its price. There is no escaping the fact that it is a very oversized PNS camera with slow to very slow lens(es) and very limited zoom range except for its really slow $750 10-100mm f/4.5-5.6 video lens. As such, it should cost no more than $300-$350. Given its terrible ergonomics, it shouldn't cost more than $300. At $300, I would give it 3 stars simply because given the right circumstances it CAN produce very nice images. Its ergonomics keep it from ever earning more than 3 stars even if was given away for free. No matter what, it is a camera I would never choose to use and actually dreaded using it while doing this review because I wanted to take pictures... and not wrestle with menus and calculate how the camera would respond to certain situations and what settings that would require to get the shot, in which time the shot had vanished.I have since returned the Nikon 1 and the only thing I miss is the gorgeous red paint.
