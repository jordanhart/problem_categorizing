{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't expect too much", "Author": "Fat Fritoman", "ReviewID": "RYSD72D6TN4SY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the latest model Samsung camera for the following reasons: I wanted a digital camera with auto flash; I wanted to spend less than $200.00; I wanted Samsung; I liked the dual tft screens. Well, I got all that, 5x zoom, and 16 megapixels, and an infinitely programmable camera which I am quite skilled at adjusting. But you can't get around the poor quality photos that this camera takes. Outdoor photos are slightly fuzzy  and washed out. I suspect the lens is inferior. Indoors with flash, the intensity of the fill light is inconsistent. Overall, the Samsung PL170 is a disapointment. I don't even know if I would be satisfied with a $300.00 digital camera now. You see, I am long time 35mm photographer, and I have found out that if you want good photos, stick to 35mm lenses and equipment.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just excellent", "Author": "James Clark", "ReviewID": "RO4GKNLR3Q5BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera around 7 months ago to replace an older Samsung model that was dying. Takes excellent photos (has Smart Option) and HD video's. I was really surprised. Came with an 8GB micro-card, tripod, card reader, charger and cleaning kit. Also Kid's (and adults) love the front LED viewer. Another great thing about it is the battery charge seems to last forever. I have went 3 days with filming and taking pic's (with flash too) without recharging and was still going strong. Excellent \"Point and Shoot\" camera and you cannot beat the price!", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "KVANG", "ReviewID": "R1BLU5TEFLSEMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW, this camera is the best digital camera I have own. I have three year old son who like to constantly be on the move. It's hard to get him to pose for a picture but with this cameras front facing LCD screen, he love taking pictures now. The animated displays make it fun for him and easier for me.Also the front screen makes it easier than ever to take those \"hard to take\" self-portraits. Using the timer, a mini tripod and the front screen, I have been able to take self-portraits me and my family. This alone was worth it.The Hi-Def picture is great but the Hi-Def video captures are phenomenal. Yes high definition video that fills up your entire flat screen TV. The HDMI cable goes from the camera directly into your TV. No adapter, no codecs. Who could ask for anything more?The only thing I would change on this the addition of a front cover protector like on their other models and perhaps a longer warranty period.I would recommend this camera for any parents of younger children or anyone on the go.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Mauricio Lucero", "ReviewID": "R32C779M5BOZLJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bougth this Samsung EC-PL170 on November 2011 and works fine, great picture quality and video also.No problems with delivery and payment.Panoramic photos is not available but I don't think that is a key issue.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera while it lasted", "Author": "Edgar", "ReviewID": "R1VPFOLMSC8N44", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my GF. She liked it, especially the dual screen option. Personally i enjoyed it too, we could take photos together quickly and accurately with-out having to rely on a third person. The picture quality for a point and shoot is great, video too. The frame rate could be quicker on the video but not bad considering its not a camcorder. Options are pretty wide. Unfortunately by clumsy GF dropped the camera and the LCD back screen (the large one) is now cracked. Oddly no visible damage is apparent on the outer case, and it still functions with the exception of the screen. Not too sure if i can cast much complain on the build quality she was the one that dropped it one the tile floor. :/", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "1.5\" Dual LCD for perfect portrait shot\nSmart Filter 2.0 to make every photo unique\n720 HD Movie\n16 Megapixel, Dual LCD", "Name": "Samsung EC-PL170 Digital Camera with 16 MP and 5x Optical Zoom (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tZqZQhHqL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004L3JQ02"}}
