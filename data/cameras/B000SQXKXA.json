And this is a good digital camera, especially for the price.Out of the box you get the camera, charging cable, battery, and USB computer cable.  Not included is a secure digital (SD) card. You'll have to get that. A 1 gig SD will set you back only $20 and is a worthy investment, enabling you to take anywhere between 300-1,000 pics.The camera is pretty basic, but has some nice features.  A slider bar on the back lets you choose between still shots, movies (saved in AVI files) and view photo mode.Easy to navigate menu button and four way navigation button enable you navigate the menus, choosing photo size, red eye removal, and cropping and photo border options.There are also advanced photo options letting you choose between portrait, landscape, night, sunset, and action shooting modes.Pictures take quickly and there is only about a half second shutter lag.I do not have anything to say about the HP software. I don't use it. I use a Mac, and iPhoto. Hooking up the camera to your Mac in this way automatically downloads photos and movies to iPhoto.The pictures are clear and beautiful.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "HP - R742  Camera - Performance and Value - A great deal", "Author": "Happy With HP", "ReviewID": "R3CEAB5C6UIC02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My recent purchase of the HP R742 Camera turned out to be a fantastic experience.  I have researched many cameras before deciding.  This camera represents and wonderful value filled with performance of higher priced cameras. Size was a major consideration for me but the other features packed into this small wonder are excellent.  The red eye removal,  the cropping function, ability to select \"shooting modes\" quickly worked great.  Picture quality is outstanding as well as the optics.I recently took the camera on vacation to Florida.  It fit nicely into my pants pocked and shirt pocket.I have since purchased a \"PDA holder\" to click on my belt.Great product.

Musk \"Pothagorus\"", "ReviewID": "R3GOW400PVMS0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a neat little guy.  I have a Nikon CoolPix 880 (a 3.3mp digital which is going on 7 years old) and I thought I would upgrade.  The CoolPix still works great, so my wife will use it around the house for shooting the kids.At least one review of this product seems to be from someone who expects too much from a piece of technology in this price range. One of the complaints is that the pictures come out dark.  Well, if you are shooting in poor lighting conditions and relying on the little flash on the camera to make up the difference then of course you will have dark pictures. But that is where Photo Shop or an equivalent program comes in handy.There are very few settings that can be changed.  In contrast my 880 can have just about every aspect customized.  However, keep in mind that the r742 is a point-and-shoot, not an SLR replacement.  There are a number of preset shooting modes that optimize shutter speeds and aperture settings for the most common shooting environments.  They seem to work very well.Here are some of the wonderful camera features. I can remove red-eye from the pictures from within the camera. The camera itself has a design gallery which lets me add frames, change color, rotate, and crop.  There is a slide-show setting. It takes movies (more on that later).  NOTE: Anytime you are modifying a picture, the camera makes a duplicate of the original picture and applies the changes to the duplicate. The original is still intact.  Also note that when editing an image within the camera, some functions will take more time than others.  One of the longest is red-eye removal.On a 2gb SD card and the camera set to full resolution I can shoot over 700 pictures.  This camera is SD/SDHC compatible.  I'm looking forward to putting in the 8gb SDHC (make sure you get a SDHC compatible card reader if you are getting an SDHC. Transferring files via the supplied USB cable is fine for a small number of pictures, but it can take a long time to transfer for large numbers of files, and you will use up your battery trying to do so).  I don't need that much storage, but the cards are cheap, so why not?  On a side note, the camera only seems to be able to count to 2000.  When looking at various quality settings, it did not matter how low I set the quality, the camera only showed 2000 as the number of photos it could take on that card.  It seems to me that a firmware update is in order.The pictures come out wonderful. I have taken some indoor pictures and the images are clear and sharp.  Of course, as I mentioned earlier, the quality will depend greatly on ambient lighting conditions and, if using the flash, how close you are to the subject(s).Now to the only negative I have about the camera: the movie feature.  It seems like it is a great feature to capture a quick moment,  but it shoots at 24fps and at 320x240 dpi, which is fine for a camera. What is bad is the audio quality.  But, let's face it, folks.  This is a Point-And-Shoot still image camera, not a camcorder.  It doesn't claim to be a camcorder replacement, nor does it even really use its video capabilities as a gimmick to draw attention to itself.  It's more of a \"I take unbelievably stunning photos (and by the way, I can also shoot some video)\" kind of camera.  If you want digital video capabilities in a handy little package, go get yourself a Flip Video.All-in-all, I highly recommend this camera.  It's ease of use and excellent picture quality make it worth the money.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good camera with 7MP at this low price", "Author": "H.

Hinkle", "ReviewID": "R3RPNATL68JQTJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the R742 about two months ago, the red version. The color is very nice (it's not a magenta red like the pictures may show). The camera color doesn't matter that much though, so let's get to the real issues. Photo quality is quite good, I have no problems with graininess, lines, color issues, etc. As far as this is concerned, it is exactly what I would expect from a camera in this price bracket ($0-$250). Sure, you can't do as much with it as you could with  a higher end camera or a SLR, but then again, look at the price you're paying.Pros:1) It is nice and small, very easy to slide into a pocket or purse to have on hand.2) While 3x zoom (the other 7x is digital and not worth anything) is not much, it works for being a small camera and seems pretty standard.3) The price is inexpensive, yet is a nice low-end camera.4) The click-to-snap time is less than a second I find (i.e. the time between when I press the button, it figures out the exact focus, sets off flash, and \"snaps\" the shot) which is better than my prior camera which seemed to delay things longer.5) The 7 MP is plenty for nice shots even if I want to enlarge to greater than 8 x 10.Things I don't like, but you may, and things I find different between the R742 and my older R727:1) The R742 power button is a bit hard to press the way it is buried. I have a medium hand size with dexterous fingers, but even I have to press it twice sometimes. The good thing about this though is you don't accidentally turn it on when it's in your pocket! However, my old R727 I sometimes turn on by accident.2) The R742 button to switch between taking and viewing photos is a \"slide\" button. It seems a bit flimsy, and although I have not had a problem with it I much prefer my older HP727 that had the buttons for this on the top that you press as it is easier to toggle between the two while taking photos.3) The lens moves out when turned on - now this is normal for a lot of cameras, but coming off of my HP727 that did not have an external lens (yet still had 3x optical, 7x digital zoom!), this has taken getting used too.4) On my old HP727, the buttons for setting focus and flash are right on the camera, but now I have to scroll through two menus to get to this; which is annoying when I want to pull this new HP742 out for a quick shot. Now, instead of less than 2 seconds to select focus range and flash setting, it takes about 10. This is a huge difference, for example, if I see some birds, or deer, etc that I want a picture of before they fly/run off.Summary:Over the course of more than two years, I would think that there should be improvements on the R742 from the older versions of pretty much the same model (i.e. my old R727). In reality, the easy usability backslid in those 2+ years, and features (The 1 MP better and faster click-to-snap time) made only tiny strides. If my menu/\"ok\" button on the R727 constantly worked I would have returned this R742 immediately, as the above two mentioned strides do not make up for the usability issues I have with it.I just went on HP's site, and did not find this camera nor very many others listed. I wonder if they are not going to make cameras any longer. I really like HP products; my desktop (HP D4100E from 2005 and still going strong, no problems at all), laptop (newly purchased TX2000z), printer/scanner/fax (C7280), and camera are all HP. However, this most recent purchase has me wishing I went with a Cannon, or had just waited until I have enough money for a Nikon SLR.

When you make a million of something, there will be a few with errors.I love the battery, the display, and the ease of use.  I can hand it to my mom who knows nothing about technology and she can figure it out.  Great little product I'm sad to see go!", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera Even batter then my sony t-300", "Author": "Jagat Biswas", "ReviewID": "R1CD7EBV660M5X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "hey its a great camera for starter.take better picture then sony camera > believe me !video isnt the great but still its okits great for pictures and picture is really clear !", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "I like it too much", "Author": "CF", "ReviewID": "R2XG87LLLJYCAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm happy with my camera, it's perfect for me.

I originally wanted the Ruby Red, but I had Amazon bucks, and it wasn't available on Amazon yet. Turns out, color was not such a big deal, and the black one was a great choice. It is easy to use, and will not take the pic if you are out of focus or moving too much. The ease of downloading the images to my laptop is great and all of the camera functions are easy to use. I'm not a pro photographer, but I just can't take a bad picture thanks to HP R742.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "HP R742 Photosmart Digital Camera (Black)", "Author": "F. M.

The camera itself is alright. I wish it had a viewfinder as well as the screen. I do not like how fast the screen shuts off. The picture quality is marginal.
