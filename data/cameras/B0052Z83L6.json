I've only used it for the past two hours and tried taken pictures indoors (on a bright day) as well as in bright lit conditions.All my pics so far are totally blurred.I may upgrade my assessment to 2 stars if it works outdoors but so far extremely disappointed.My second gripe is that it is very hard to know if you have taken a photo or not.  with no audible click (and no playback) its hard to know. There is a little light on the front of the camera that blinks on and off but given its on the front you can't see it.  So far I only took about 1/2 of those I thought I'd taken and having now seen them, wish I hadn't.I love toys but this really does seem like useless Clap.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too small", "Author": "Barbara Duke", "ReviewID": "R3MO3FVGZH7GX7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I still haven't figured out this little camera. It is so small, so if you have bad eyesight, it is too small for you. I am sure someone with a better understanding of technology would like it better. It is cute, but I don't think it is worth the money paid for it. I haven't got one picture out of it yet. It has been frustrating.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$43.95", "Features": "Photo and Movie Feature, 2 MP\nUtilizes Micro SD Card up to 16GB (Not included)\nPlugs directly into your USB\nFor Windows and Mac, No Driver needed\n1280 x 1024 Resolution, Fine Glass Lens", "Name": "Superheadz CLAP Digital Camera Powershovel White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21iQTaueiUL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0052Z83L6"}}
