{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great entry to photography", "Author": "Brandon J \"killerhertz\"", "ReviewID": "R1VD925OGMJ1T9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a few friends with DSLR and micro-4/3 cameras and I was told to look at micro-4/3 due to it's lower cost of entry and portability. In the short term I wanted a new camera to take on my honeymoon, but my long term goal was to improve my photography skills beyond a compact point and shoot.After much research I decided between the Olympus OM-D E-M5 and Panasonic DMC-G5KK. While I feel the Olympus is a better camera on paper, I didn't feel the cost differential was justified in my case. Micro-4/3 is still a relatively new platform, and I think the cameras will improve quite a bit in the next couple of years. Perhaps in that time I'll upgrade to a camera with a more rugged body and in body stabilization. FWIW, I purchased the DMC-G5 ($699), which included the 14-42mm zoom lens, along with the Lumix 20mm f/1.7 pancake lens ($332).The combo is low profile and lightweight due to the pancake lens. I purchased the Crumpler \"4 million dollar home\" camera bag, which comfortably fits the G5, 20mm pancake, 14-42 mm kit lens, spare battery, charger, snackbar, and hand cleanser (a nice to have on vacation). I highly recommend this to anyone look at the G5 or other similarly sized micro-4/3s.The 20mm pancake shoots amazing pictures with the G5. Landscapes and interiors look great, but portraits are amazing! I was overall quite impressed with photos I took on my vacation, the majority of which I used intelligent auto since I didn't have the time to learn about the camera. I would say I took 90% of my photos using the pancake since it was more convenient and much faster. I only used the zoom lens when I couldn't zoom with my feet.My favorite things about the camera thus far:1) Autofocus speed (combined w/ the 20mm)2) Ergonomics and weight3) HD video w/ autofocus4) Large articulating touchscreen w/ AF tracking (touch screen and it will focus and track the subject!)5) Depth of focus adjustment/box6) RAW photos (works with Lightroom)Things I dislike:1) EVF sensor: even at the low sensitivity setting, my finger occasionally disables the LCD. I wish they put the sensor at the top of the EVF or something2) Panasonic software: it's not well designed. You're better off buying Adobe Lightroom to handle the importing and post-processing.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Accurate AF, Stunning Videos, Shutter Shock No More", "Author": "J. Gebauer", "ReviewID": "R1NPH9XRQL2HPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To start with I have both the Panasonic GF5 and the G5 and I also shoot Nikon digital cameras. I've been very happy with the Panasonic G5 and M43 system. Many of the little things that bothered me with the GF5 like AF accuracy, AF hunting when recording videos, limited number of customizable function buttons, zoom lens blocking flash coverage at wide angle focal lengths, and no 1080p/60fps videos are resolved with the G5. Plus the G5 is 16MP vs the GF5 only being 12MP. The G5 also has features which my much more expensive Nikon doesn't have like an articulating touch screen and the ability to shoot 1080p/60fps videos.What I love about the G5:1. The G5 has a nice balance of buttons and customization which meets the needs of both novices and those wanting more control of their camera. For people purchasing a DSLR/DSLM camera for the time it probably won't feel as overwhelming as some DSLR's would. While it doesn't have the number of buttons as my Nikon DSLR with the use of the \"Q Menu\" I can get to more of what I want quicker than with my DSLR. The \"Q Menu\" allows you to create your personalized mini menu for quick access for those settings you adjust the most. In addition there are function buttons on the camera and touch screen which can be customized for the features you use all the time.2. The articulating screen was one of the main selling points for me when purchasing the G5. The articulating screen is great when photographing with the camera above your head and near to the ground. I actually use it almost all the time when I photograph. You are steadier when you shoot with your hands and camera at your chest versus held up to your eye. If you like shooting candids or documentary of people you can get better shots if the camera is at your chest or waist level. As soon as your camera is at your eye and pointed at a person, that person starts acting different.3. The articulating screen being a touch screen was another big selling point for me. The combination of the touch screen and pin point or single focus area creates a powerful tool for any photographer. I only shoot single focus area on my DSLR's. Unlike my Nikon DSLR which I have to hold a button down and use the pad on the back of the camera to scroll through the AF area points, with the G5 all I do is touch the area, any area except the very edge, on the screen I want the camera to focus on. Person moves from the right to the left of the frame, I touch their face, and hit the shutter button...that quick and simple. It is worth noting that the touch screen isn't as sensitive as a smart phone touch screen but it seems better than the GF5 screen.4. I found that the GF5 when shooting in the 23 AF area where the camera selects the AF point would commonly focus on the background instead the person in the foreground who was in the center of the frame and filling up a majority of the frame. The G5 doesn't have that issue. The AF with the G5 is speedy and silent which is great for photography but a must have when shooting videos. It's focus speed is as fast as much more expensive prosumer DSLR cameras. The only issue I've run into is that when shooting sequential frames in continuous AF the AF doesn't perform as accurately as my Nikon DSLR.5. The 1080p/60fps videos from the G5 are nothing short of beautiful. The 60fps produces very smooth looking videos. The 1080 resolution is very sharp and crisp looking, better than any other P&S;, ILC, or DSLR I've had. The only other camera I have that shoots 60fps is the Sony HX20V. The G5 having a much larger sensor than the Sony HX20V produces a much shallower depth of field for beautiful videos. I actually like the depth of field with the G5 better than videos from APS-C cameras. The depth of field is shallow but a little greater than those from APS-C sensors. I find it to be a perfect blend for everyday videos. The AF while shooting videos is excellent also. Unlike my Nikon DSLR there is no focus hunting when shooting videos with the G5 and because the AF is silent I also don't hear the lens focusing. My GF5 even does some focus hunting.6. The digital viewfinder is actually usable with the G5. There have been considerable improvements in digital viewfinder resolution, color, and contrast in the last few years. I remember playing around with one of Sony's first DSLM cameras a few years ago which had a digital viewfinder and thinking to myself there is no way I could shoot with this camera because of the digital viewfinder.7. The G5 has an electronic shutter, E Shutter, feature to prevent shutter shock. Shutter shock occurs when the slapping of the shutter causes the sensor to vibrate when the picture is taken, some believe it can impact the OIS also, which results in a soft or slightly blurry image. It seems to primarily occur at shutter speeds of 1/60-1/250. When I heard about shutter shock and the E Shutter feature I was bit skeptical. I did a test shooting 100 frames with the E Shutter on and 100 with the E shutter off at shutter speeds of 1/60-1/320. For 50 of the frames with the E Shutter on and 50 with the E Shutter off, I used image stabilization. The other 50 for each I turned the stabilization off. People have tested the E Shutter photographing a chart while the camera was on a tripod (copy stand work), I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference in real life photo situations. The images shot were of still life and I was hand holding the camera. When I used a telephoto focal length without stabilization I made sure my shutter speed was on the higher end of the range. The electronic shutter did give better results! I had no incidences of soft or blurry images with the E Shutter on and stabilization off. With stabilization and E Shutter on I had 2 soft or blurry images. With stabilization and E Shutter off, I had 4 soft or blurry images. The worst results came from stabilization on and E Shutter off in which I had 6 soft or blurry images. After the test I started photographing regularly with E Shutter on and have noticed more consistent, better results. Before doing the test I wasn't using E Shutter and was getting some mysteriously soft, blurry images. The downside of E Shutter is that it can't be used with the flash or ISOs greater than 1600. There can also be bending or distortion of shapes which are moving in the frame. I have witnessed the distortion once when taking a picture of someone moving in the frame while the picture was taken.8. The compactness of the G5 is a nice selling feature. While the G5 isn't as small or pocketable like the GF5 it is significantly smaller and lighter than any Nikon DSLR I've owned. It is much easier to carry around the G5 with a couple extra lenses than my Nikon with a couple extra lenses. Some people may equate the compactness and lightness of weight as being cheap or like a toy camera but I think they are missing one of the advantages of the camera and M43 system in general.What I don't like about the G5 kit:1. The biggest down side of the camera outfit is the 14-42mm kit lens. The kit lens is kind of what it is, an inexpensive lens with a plastic mount, plastic body, and sticky zoom. It takes decent enough pictures but the corners and edges are pretty soft, at times even when stopped down to f/8. I do have a full review of the kit lens for anyone interested.2. With the lowest ISO being 160 and a top shutter speed of 1/4000, on a sunny day the widest open your lens can be is f/2.8 or more commonly f/3.5. This really limits your ability to create images with a very shallow depth of field when using fast lenses.3. If you go back and forth between the screen and viewfinder the eye sensor on the camera is nice to have. It is designed to sense when your eye goes to the viewfinder. It then turn the display off and viewfinder on therefore saving battery life. Even with the eye sensor sensitivity adjusted to low it is WAY too sensitive. If a shadow passes over the eye sensor the display turns off and viewfinder turns on. Even on a cloudy day if my hand passes over the sensor, 3\" inches from the camera, the display turns off.If you are already in the M43 system this is a great camera to add to your system or upgrade to. If you are looking at getting into a DSLR or DSLM camera system the decision to purchase this over other cameras similarly priced is a little more difficult decision to make. The G5 is a little more compact than an introductory DSLR. It is roughly a centimeter shorter in each dimension and weighs about 25% less than Nikon's D3200. The G5 has an articulating touch screen vs the D3200 which doesn't. The G5 shoots 1080p/60fps videos whereas the D3200 shoots 1080p/30fps. The G5 also costs $100 less than the D3200. The D3200 on the other hand has a larger sensor that performs better in low light. The D3200 has a better kit lens. The D3200 is 24MP vs the G5 which is 16MP. While M43 cameras have the best variety of lenses of any mirrorless system it still can't compete with the selection you have with Nikon or Canon. In the end it depends on which of those features are the most important to you as a buyer.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid camera and one of the best M 4/3 around", "Author": "MysticJaguar", "ReviewID": "R2O4FSXQYL264Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a 35mm film Minolta owner for a long time, then Nikon (FM/FE), then more recently D50/D40/D60. I've had Panasonic FZ28/35 and found the sensor size and quality wanting.  I looked at the Sony Alpha but found the a37 lacking a few things I wanted and the A57 too large/heavy.  Earlier this year I had a Nikon D5100. Great camera.  But I was looking for something smaller and lighter.  The M 4/3 (MFT) platform is a clear winner.  So much so that I no longer own the D5100.  And it feels great to use the DMC-G5.  I'm excited about shooting again!Technically, the sensor on the DMC-G5 is a very strong performer.  The UI gives you hints when you need them (like a flashing icon to push in and rotate the control wheel when you have overridden the standard exposure (EV) controls).  The focus is among the fastest of any camera I've ever used.  I really like the level indicators that appear in the viewfinder to let you know you are square to horizontal or vertical.Overall the camera feels great in the hands and it is very light and yet not too small.  So far I don't feel like there is any feature that I would use that is missing.  I did sell the 14-42mm kit lens and put on an older Panasonic 14-45mm lens and the results are very solid.The EVF is adequate.  I would not use a MFT camera that did not have a viewfinder.  LCDs are still hopeless in strong sunlight.  I've found the EVF in this camera so good that most of the time I'm shooting with LCD folded in and turned off.  It's that good.  (And means I get more shots on one battery charge.  And getting a second battery is recommended for this any any camera with an EVF.)The ONLY thing that bugs me about this camera, and it's a nit, is the operation of the power switch.  It's on the right of the control dial and it's the same place thus far on all the Lumix MFT.  I would rather have this been a reactive switch where when you push it forward it changes the current power setting (push forward to turn on, push forward again to turn off).  The absolute positioning seems strange but that's just to me.  I've found myself pushing it forward when I want to turn the camera off.  It's certainly not going to take away from the rest of the performance of the camera.  (I think because my first digital camera as a Sony DSC-S75 who's power switch worked that way that's why I'm doing it on this camera.)In the past a primary selling point for cameras, for those who cared about the future and building up a personal kit, was that you were buying into a system.  This is still true.  But now the system is more like a wider MFT 'system' which crosses manufactures and equipment both new and old.  The fact that you can use Panasonic and Olympus lens AND many legacy lens with adapters is an astounding eye opener.  Why not, like in the PC market, have uniform standards with many if not all interchangeable parts?  Let the camera makers compete on features that are exchangeable.  Thus far the other major camera makers have balked at joining the MFT party and they are missing out.  Check The Online Photographer article entitled 'Micro 4/3 is the Big Kahuna' for some more perspectives.  You should also be visiting 43rumors and sansmirror to be informed in MFT.To me this is a great camera for the enthusiast who is looking for a lightweight highly versatile camera for a wide range of uses and who wants to spend less than $600-700.  (DXOMark puts this camera ahead of DMC-G3 and DMC-GH2 in sensor measurements in all marks except for effective low light ISO which is strange because it's pretty good in low light.)If I was going to buy up the chain in the MFT systems then either the OM-D E-M5 or DMC-GH3 would be the next steps up.  (And keep the DMC-G5 as a second body.)Update:  11-MAR-2013 - I have found a bug that the firmware needs fixing for.  I discovered yesterday that if you switch back to review mode from standard still shooting mode like P or C2, it may not always make it back into review mode. It can appear that you are still in the standard view mode (through the lens).  I was pressing review like four or five times and it would not switch over.  Then I realized that if after you hit review, and nothing seems to have happened, if you click the command dial to the left or right, it will actually become unstuck from the TTL view and start showing you photos you have taken, Viola, you are in review mode.  If anyone else has found this please comment.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Even better than I had expected", "Author": "Francis D. Ferrall \"Delphititan\"", "ReviewID": "R30B159FLH9D13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered my G5 after having seen nice early reports from a few online testers. I bought it within the first few days of it's release. I had considered buying the E-M5, but I had a few reservations about the way the LCD articulated and the higher price. I have a preference for the LCD articulation mechanics used on the G5.I was pleasantly surprised by the images I captured at a high school reunion the day I received the camera. I immediately noticed an improvement over my previous Olympus Pen models in dynamic range. The high ISO noise levels were simply impressive compared to the Pens. I learned quickly how to use the custom white balance setting and my out of camera jpeg files have consistently accurate color rendition. The images are nice and sharp and will likely print well at print sizes larger than 16\"x20\".I believe this camera is an excellent option for those considering the E-M5 based not on a direct personal comparison but from what I seen published at many sites online.I recommend the G5 highly.Panasonic  DMC-G5KBODY 16MP SLR Camera  with 3-Inch LCD - Body Only  (Black)Dan", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Panasonic G5 is a sleeper and cheap too!", "Author": "MPC", "ReviewID": "R2UCQD9WY5PUZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've finally decided to review the Panasonic G5 in hopes that it will help others.  This is my first review.  I am not a pro photographer.  As a serious amateur, I normally shoot with Canon and Nikon DSLRs.  I made this purchase in December 2012 because I wanted a camera with a quiet shutter when shooting funerals.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA.  Below is a list of features and comments, as well as the accessories I use (in no particular order).The G5's shutter can be toggled between conventional or electronic.  In the electronic mode, it is absolutely silent.  Someone standing one foot away from you will not hear the shutter click.  I have remapped the electronic shutter setting to the AF/AE LOCK (FN1) button on the back of the camera near the top.  I don't want to waste the time going through the menus to change the setting.  Press this key twice and it goes from conventional to electronic.  Press twice again and it goes back to conventional. As mentioned by others, when the electronic shutter is enabled, the flash will not work and you cannot shoot above ISO 1600.  Also, under certain conditions, when panning the camera while shooting a moving object, the picture may be distorted (elongated), especially around the edges of the frame.Some people have mentioned that the camera seems cheap and \"plasticky\".  The camera seems to be well made.  The fact that it is made out of plastic helped me yesterday when the camera body separated from the lens and fell on the ground!  It bounced but wasn't scratched and is still working!  With a regular DSLR, it definitely would have been dented.  I was testing the G5 body attached to a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8 L using a Fotodiox Pro Lens Mount Adapter.  The camera strap was attached to the lens mount.So shooting with the Fotodiox Pro Lens Mount Adapter with Built-in Aperture Iris, Canon EOS EF (NOT EF-S) to Micro Four Thirds (MFT) Camera ($54.95) from Amazon worked well.  The attached Canon lens will shoot wide open with a 2x multiplier.  You can set the G5 to Aperture priority and let it pick the shutter speed.  If there is too much light, you can turn the aperture ring on the Fotodiox adapter to let in less light.  The numbers on the dial do not correspond with any f/stop setting.  Of course, the focusing is manual which is not a problem unless you are shooting with a wide angle (where the actual focus is hard to see).  My camera fell off the lens because I accidentally pressed the lens release while walking.  The lens release sticks out more than necessary.The G5 with the kit 14-42mm lens has a very stiff zoom ring.  If you are shooting video, you will not be able to do a smooth zoom.  The image will jerk as the zoom ring is turned.  I purchased the Panasonic 14-45mm lens which was included in older Panasonic camera kits.  The zoom ring on these is very smooth.If you shoot video, do not buy aftermarket batteries.  The OEM Panasonic batteries have a chip that keeps track of the power remaining and then communicates this to the camera.  When shooting in the MP4 format, the maximum recording time for one file is about 29 minutes.  I'm not sure if it is the same for AVCHD.  When I was using the Wasabi aftermarket battery during a video shoot, the camera thought the battery was out of power and immediately turned off!  Luckily, I did not lose the file.  I do know other people who have lost their video file because of this.  Unlike aftermarket batteries, when the battery power is low, a Panasonic battery will write the video file to the card and then shut down.  For shooting stills, aftermarket batteries are OK.If you are a serious video shooter, the lack of a microphone jack will probably be a deal breaker.  If you need one, you'll have to buy the new G6.The frames per second rate on this camera is very fast and is similar to conventional DSLRs.  However, the buffer is small so it fills up very quickly.  When shooting action shots in RAW, the camera will stop shooting after holding the shutter button down for one second.  I am using a Transcend 32GB Class 10 card available from Amazon for about $23.  Other people on the internet have said that changing to a faster card did not increase the write speed.  When shooting rapid sequences, it is better to disable the electronic shutter so you can hear how many shots the camera has taken.Some people have complained about the electronic viewfinder.  I like it because in low light situations, the viewfinder will \"gain up\" and you will be able to see dark objects as if they were properly lighted.  Of course, this also means the camera can take a properly focused picture (although at a low shutter speed).  Try this by turning off the lights in a room, leave your TV on and then go to a dark corner of the room and look through the viewfinder while pressing the shutter half way down.  The camera will show you objects that your eye cannot see with the natural light!One thing that bugs me about the camera is the touch screen.  It works well but is easy to accidentally change a setting while carrying it around.  If you flip the screen to the covered position, it is still possible to accidentally change a setting when carrying the camera if your hand touches the circular 4-way controller.  I have accidentally changed the white balance many times this way.  You can always press the Q MENU button to check/change all your settings at a glance.One additional comment regarding the 4-way controller.  The words are glossy chrome on a brushed chrome background so it is very hard to read.  You have to tilt the camera at an angle till the words are readable.  In dim light, the words are impossible to read so you need to know the positions by memorizing them.  Look at the newer Panasonic G6 and you will see that they made it easier to read.For video, I am using the \"Opteka X-GRIP EX MK III Heavy Duty Steel Action Stabilizing Video Handle for Cameras & Camcorders\" ($59.95 from Amazon).  I like the all metal construction.  The camera can be mounted slightly offset so you can access the battery compartment without removing the camera from the grip.  You also need to mount the camera farther to the front or the camera will disable the flip LCD panel thinking that someone is looking through the viewfinder.  Mounted in this position, the flip LCD panel might not close.  I just fold the flip LCD panel back against the video handle.  I wrapped some foam with black electrical tape around the handle at this point so the screen won't be scratched.I also bought the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7.  The lens is extremely sharp and available light pictures are effortless.  The lens is very short.  The lens is a little noisy as it focuses.  There are some situations where I could not back up enough to get everyone into a picture but this is offset by the low light capabilities.There are 2 straps I use with this camera.  I am a fan of the BlackRapid straps.  The first strap is the BlackRapid wrist strap.  It is $18.95 at Amazon.  Be sure to buy the additional BlackRapid fastener which screws into the camera's tripod socket.  The second strap is the \"BlackRapid RS-Sport 2 \"Slim\" Sling Camera Strap with BRAD, ConnectR-2 & FastenR-3\" at $69.95.  I use this strap with light DSLRs.  It  has an additional strap that wraps around your shoulder and armpit which stops the main strap from creeping.  You can wear a coat/jacket over this strap and then pull out the camera when needed.  In this way, your hands are always free.  When I use this strap, I usually wear a black shirt so it is very difficult for people to see you are carrying a camera since it is hanging behind your arm.The software included to convert RAW images is decent.  Use Adobe Lightroom if you already have it.  I have been using Topaz DeNoise to remove high ISO noise.  They have a 30 day full functioning trial.  This is the best noise reduction program I have used so far.  The presets work well to start.  It can even remove noise banding!", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-G5KBODY 16MP SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD - Body Only", "Author": "CJ \"MazPharma\"", "ReviewID": "R3IA8TOXXX1UR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this at reduced price to replaced a new camera body I \"drowned\" in a swimming pool. Since this was not advertized as brand new I was skeptical. However, the camera was actually brand new, not a mark to indicate previous use. I'm delighted with this product which has worked flawlessly over the past month of intensive use.UPDATE: Review of Panasonic Lumix G5 with 14-42 kit lens: Placing my review on this page because could not write review on the G5+kit lens I originally bought.Panasonic Lumix G5 with 14-42mm kit lensUnbeatable for the price. The G5 MFT (micro four thirds)digital camera is ideal for informed novices to expert photographers. Probably will not compete with a full blown SLR but comes awfully close, as do many MFTs today. Go beyond the kit 14-42mm lens if you want to explore the full potential of the G5. I sold the notchy 14-42mm kit lens (reasonable pictures but a pain to zoom) for a used 14-45mm lens (smooth operation, steel mount instead of plastic, superior pictures). Also bought a used Panasonic 20mm f1.7 lens (very sharp!) which, as many say, gets the most use and shows how good the G5 really is (see recently posted fotos). The Panasonic 45-150mm zoom lens complements my collection and gives great quality pictures even at 150mm.Overall: the G5 takes good, true colour fotos, both indoors and outdoors. Size is perfect for carrying around, a huge advantage over the large SLR's. Over the past 3 months I've taken several thousand fotos, sufficient to expose the good and bad points of the G5:The Good:-Nice molded grip, light body (even with zoom lenses) but not too light; relatively small size allows \"carry anywhere anytime\" convenience-Versatility - opt to shoot with the convenient Auto (and extended iA function) for quick quality snapshots OR use one of the many options to set the camera up for just about any situation (5 Custom options in addition to the usual P,S,A,M); results will be good either way; nice array of light settings, including ability to modify each; if you don't like the incandescent light (I don't), use AWB or a Kelvin setting easily adjustable to your taste-High resolution; excellent quality fotos up to ISO 3200; ISO 6400 is good for smaller prints-14-42mm kit lens often a little soft but can be sharpened (in camera or post foto processing); can easily set up program for Standard, Natural, -Vivid, Scenery, Monochrome, Portrait fotos (increase/decrease brightness, sharpness, saturation, noise reduction to personal taste)-Shoots RAW; also RAW+JPEG-Bright clear flexible foldout/tilt LCD screen + excellent electronic viewfinder (EVF) for those who want to compose with either - I often use the -LCD for settings, and the EVF for composing-LCD touch screen works well, need to find the right \"touch\" for best results (some complaints on sensitivity not really warranted IMO-Most controls are well placed, intuitive for ease of use, mostly (see -ve's below)-Love the Q (quick) menu button located right of EVF, use it all the time-Nice option to switch LCD on or off/or to use the eye detector to turn LCD of when using EVF; I use the LCD for selecting focus area even if composing with EVF; nice feature-Autofocus is fast as claimed; manual option a real asset for very specific objects; prefer to use manual focus on close-ups-In-lens stabilization works well (not available in my Panasonic 20mm lens but do you really need it??)-Lever behind shoot button can be used for several functions - I find it v handy for changing light settings, nicely placed-The 4-function silver dial wheel is a boon, I use it all the time (as with my previous Panasonic point+shoot FH25)The Not so Good:-Terrible pdf User manual; strongly advise following links for fast set up [[...]  and about 20 G5 tutorials for a wide range of shooting conditions [[...] These are brief, educational, and bypass the lengthy pdf manual (don't even think about printing all 330 pages)-Some of the small function buttons too fiddly - needed pressing 2-3 times-The pinwheel disc on top right corner, for changing aperture on my G5, feels flimsy but is holding up so far; also skips from one function to another but this quirk improves with practice-Although fun, scene/art buttons are more gimmicky than useful; personal taste-Flash will not work if electronic shutter turned on (I spent hours trying to trouble shoot this in manual; found solution online)-Modest battery life (250-350 fotos range); can be increased significantly if don't use LCD; hard to find genuine Panasonic replacement battery -- settled for Synergy, not bad but watch out for numerous short-lived generics -- some don't show the charge status-Taking a foto with the touchscreen never worked well fro me, giving blurry images, but then I never missed itThe Bad:-Nothing so farConclusions: the G5 is a very nice, well built camera at a very reasonable price (reduced from $698 to $498), with more functions than most will ever use. I recommend prospective buyers have some basic knowledge of photography before deciding on the G5. It doesn't take much to mess up a photograph due to wrong setting(s), and then give the G5 a bad review.  That said, the G5 can deliver nice results for the novice using the simple red A or iA buttons conveniently located on the top right of the camera.I researched digital cameras for months with the following priorities: high resolution (G5 goes up to a usable ISO 6400); quick focus; potential for indoor/low light/ photography; reasonable ease of use. The G5 delivered on all fronts. Low light capability is best achieved with a good fast lens, though. I strongly advise the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 (see reviewer comments, all 4-5 star:Panasonic Aspherical Pancake Interchangeable Cameras . This, plus one of the zoom lenses, will really expose the G5's true potential and versatility.PS: I dropped my first G5 in the swimming pool so immediately ordered a replacement body.

I decided to say goodbye to Canon after many years and many lenses, wanting something more compact with a more modern feel.  I was split between this and an Olympus E-PL5, but ultimately decided to keep the G5.  Major \"gotta have\" features for me were: great low-light performance, picture quality, portability, a tilting touch-screen, and lens selection.The G5 produces very nice pictures, with pleasing color.  The 14-42 lens included in the G5KK kit is junk; it'll suffice for beginners, but compared even to other kit lenses, it's not as sharp, feels plasticy, and the zoom mechanism feels terrible - not smooth at all, and even after just a week it feels \"notchy\", i.e. there are certain spots in the zoom range where it jerks just a little.  Luckily, there are many other Lumix lenses that are built much better, like the 45-150mm zoom lens I got as well.I had an E-PL5 as well for a few weeks, and while I do think the E-PL5 produced slightly better pictures, the G5 was an overall better package.  Some more notable features this has over the E-PL5:- Built-in viewfinder- Built-in flash- Digital level- HDR modeI decided to stick with the G5 because of these features, but also because:- The hand grip is better, easier to hold for my big hands- The optical image stabilization, though built into the lenses instead of the body, is more effective than IBIS used by the E-PL5- The menu system is better/easier to navigate on the Lumix- Little touches, like included lens hoods, or a battery charger with flip-out AC plug, instead of a bulky corded charger Olympus usesIn terms of picture quality, there are plenty of reviews out there for both the G5 and the E-PL5, and while the general consensus is that the E-PL5 produces better images, I'd say it depends. I did many side-by-side shots (all in JPG mode), and found myself split on which image I preferred.  Sometimes the G5, sometimes the E-PL5, sometimes they were equal.  I'd say color reproduction is slightly more accurate on the G5 overall, whereas the Olympus's image processing tends to enhance some colors, leading to pictures that look nicer than reality.  Low light pictures from the E-PL5 are slightly less noisy in general, but the G5 is close.There are a few things I liked better on the E-PL5:- Capacitive touch screen, it responds to finger touches much better- Tilting touch screen, seemed easier to use and more natural than the vari-angle display of the G5- Button feel; on the G5, they feel kinda mushy (especially the 4-way controller)- Overall nicer build quality, less plasticyIn principle I like what Sony is offering with the NEX line, but I'm not happy with how they haphazardly mix and match features and price points.  You have to buy the $900 NEX-6 before you can get a mode dial, but it doesn't include a touch screen of the $700 NEX-5R, which doesn't include the pop-up flash of the $500 NEX-F3.  That, combined with overall higher prices and limited lens selection led me to choose micro 4/3 over NEX.  To me, Canon's EOS M is a failure, so I didn't even consider it, even though I have plenty of Canon lenses to use with it.So far I'm really happy with the G5 and like the pictures I'm getting from it.  I'm sure I'll eventually upgrade if they introduce a G6 that improves in any of the areas I mentioned, or if I can get an Olympus E-M5 for cheap.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well balanced feel, terrific images", "Author": "D.A.

The G5 has a nice grip to go along with all those great lenses!

There is a major flaw for those of us who are into many aspects of photography. Every other camera I have, including the Lumix FZ-150 I can set bracketing, frame rate and the self-timer separately thus allowing the camera to take bracketed images fired by the shutter button at a high frame rate or fire by using the self-timer with the timer firing all the bracketed images. The G5 camera will not do that. The frame rate, bracketing and self-timer are ALL in the same menu option and you can only pick one. So to fire a bracket shot the ONLY option is to press the shutter button. For anyone who does bracketing this is done either at a very fast frame rate or 9 times out of 10 on a tripod. Pressing the shutter button for each shot is ridiculous; it will cause the camera to move even on a tripod. I never expected this camera to be designed like this and unfortunately I cannot return it, well past the 30 day window, never expected this limitation.I do want to say there is a number of things I do like about the camera.

Bennett", "ReviewID": "R2MJ62XD7UIRS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our 4th Panasonic Micro 4/3 camera. It replaces my wife's original G1, and in this review I'll compare it to my GF1 and GH2 bodies.The Panasonic G5 is the latest model in the G-series Micro 4/3 cameras. Panasonic also makes the GF, GX, and GH series of Micro 4/3 cameras, all with slightly different feature sets. The G-series is the original, and comes with a built-in electronic eye-level viewfinder and a beautiful articulating LCD display.The G1 and GF1 were released several years ago and completely redefined the compact camera as a usable tool for quality image making. The GH1 followed and added amazing video quality. Several generations later we've arrived at the G5, but now there are many more manufacturers and models out there, so why upgrade from an older model, and why choose this one?1. Image quality. The G5 is significantly improved over the G1 and GF1. Its 16 megapixel sensor makes excellent images up to ISO 3200, which is 3 stops better than the original model. (Note that I am shooting raw files and processing them appropriately in Lightroom 4.3. I neither know nor care anything about in-camera JPEG quality.) As we tend to shoot indoor candid photography under very low light, high ISO quality is important to us, and the G5 delivers that. The G5 is certainly the equal to if not slightly better than the GH2 under similar conditions. Even photos shot at ISO 6400 are usable and print well up to 11x14 inches. Other cameras with similar image quality are significantly more expensive at this time.2. Design and user interface. The handgrip and the terrific EVF make this a comfortable camera to hold and shoot. The G5 has a toggle switch for the power-zoom lenses set just behind the shutter, and that switch may be used to change exposure compensation or manual exposure settings (if you're not using a power zoom lens.) Used with the thumb wheel, the photographer now has a two-dial system for manual or auto exposure shooting. Keeping the camera in Aperture Priority mode most of the time, the Aperture is set with the thumb wheel, and the exposure compensation is easily and quickly dialed in with the toggle.3. Ability to customize. The extensive and fairly easy to use menu system allows the photographer to customize many areas of the camera. For example, if, like me, you're used to Thumb Button Focus on larger Canon and Nikon cameras, that's easy to enable on the G5 -- just turn Shutter AF to Off, and AF/AE Lock Hold to Off, and the AF thumb button now functions to engage autofocus completely separate from the shutter button, which now just fires the shutter. This is not possible on the G1 or GF1.There are some losses from the G1 and the GH2 in external manual controls. The G5 doesn't have an external dial for focus modes (AFS, AFC, M) or drive modes (single, continuous, bracket, self timer) -- these are done by pressing one of the 4-way controller buttons and choosing from a menu. That is a little fussier, but these are not things that I do often enough to matter.One major reason to choose Micro 4/3 over another system is the wide choice in lenses from Panasonic, Olympus, and now Sigma and others. Some competing mirrorless systems have great zoom lenses, and some have excellent primes, but as far as I can tell, none have the selection of both that is available in M4/3. From the trio of excellent Panasonic fixed-aperture zooms (7-14, 12-35, and 35-100) to the amazing Olympus 75/1.8 and the Panny/Leica 25/1.4, there is a set of lenses for everyone. So now that I've mentioned that, I'll recommend adding some lenses to this kit. The 14-42 lens that comes with it is perfectly fine, but the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 or the Olympus 45mm f/1.8 will take this camera to a whole new level of performance for a reasonable price.Now I think I'll order another one as a second body to go with my GH2, and retire the GF1 completely.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera but average kit lens", "Author": "R.

As mentioned in many other reviews, this is a feature rich camera, which are also available in DSLR but not to be expected in entry level DSLR camera. Compare to Canon XS that I have, this camera stands its own in terms of picture quality. However due to kit lens I still fee canon is winning in terms of sharpness. I have a feeling Canon EFS kit lens is better than kit lens with G5. there are times when I am feeling pictures are slightly soft compared to Canon. But with good glass pictures quality can be much improved.Another aspect where I feel this camera can improve is the white balance in indoor conditions. It has plenty of pre configured white balance setting but they don't work out of the box the way I want it. Tungsten bulb setting produced greenish yellow colors which is not appropriate. AWB is also something it can improve on. I adjust white balance on this camera manually way more than my Canon.Video is great in this camera. Different format you can record is awesome.

Perhaps the same can be said of photographers.Some eight or nine years ago I bought a Canon 10D, and subsequently upgraded to a Canon 40D over time. This past summer I did a road trip around Oregon with a Tamrac photo pack in the back of the car stuffed with the 40D and lots of lenses.  After that experience, I came to the realization that at 60, I was not up to hauling so much equipment about the countryside, as I was when I was 50. I just don't have as much cartilage in my joints as I used to.So I began looking at four-thirds system cameras.  They provide much of the quality of the APS-C sensor DLSR cameras, and they are smaller, take smaller lenses, they are lighter, and they are cheaper. (Canon 10D, 20D, 30D, 40D, every model upgrade would cost me another $1200.  Enough of that!) After much research it came down to a decision between the Panasonic Lumix G5 or the G6. At the time the G6 was of limited availability and cost $(well you know what they list for). Used G5s on the other hand were quite plentiful on E**y and on Amazon. I ended up buying two used G5s for less than the cost of a G6.  Yes, I gave up some bells and whistles, but I got a camera that provided the basic functionality (and beyond) that any professional or serious amateur would need. (I am addressing only still photography here, I can't comment on video.) \"Used?\" you ask.  Well, yes, only a relatively few photographers use their equipment day in and day out.  Most of us haul it out for vacations, and holidays.  Other than that, it sits in the closet. (Sewing machines and Kitchenaid mixers fall into the same category) So used camera equipment is generally a very good deal.I purchased a Lumix 45-150mm telephoto zoom, and the ultra-compact Vario G X 14-42mm zoom, and some macro extension rings. And some day, I'll pick up the 7-14mm Lumix wide angle zoom.  The ultra-compact Vario G X zoom replaces the 'standard kit lens' because I wanted an ultra-portable camera+lens combination. It also has the advantage of zooming much more smoothly. If you have pants with cargo pockets, your G5 is now a pocket camera.Digital cameras in general (not just Lumix) have become burdened with complex menu systems, as manufactures have struggled to outdo each other and provide all things to all people. The G5 menu system is not so bad, you can get used to it, and the quick menu is an oft-used (and useful) shortcut. The ergonomics are not as refined as on say the Canon 40D, but I can deal with it.The G5 with the two zoom lenses with the extension rings have made making good-quality macro photos very easy.So as I sell off the Canon equipment, I am content that I got good use out of it, and I am happy to see it go.  I really like the smaller, lighter Lumix G5, and the associated Lumix lenses.  The image quality is better than that of the oder Canon 40D, and I didn't have to spend $1200 to upgrade to newer technology. The rainy season is arriving in Oregon, and as I put away my camera equipment for the next nine months, I feel better at having tied up less money in equipment that must sit in the closet until the sun comes out again.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like this camera.", "Author": "Liu Wei", "ReviewID": "R1O3CJK2EM5HN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a GF2 user, I upgrade my gear with this G5 body after studying it and reviewing other users' comments.

The resulting images are very good, with very good detail.  I have a Lumix FZ200 as well which produces images scarcely different from the G5.  However, the G5 has a clearly superior viewfinder as compared with the FZ200's VF.  The FZ200 viewfinder is good, but using it has more of the experience of looking at the scene through a tunnel.The downfall of the G5 is its basic kit lens.  It is acceptable, but not much more.  The camera needs a short zoom lens with a wider maximum aperture allowing the G5 to use ISO100 and ISO80, rather than the lowest ISO160 with the kit zoom lens.  ISO160 might be acceptable for many compact cameras, but in a larger bridge camera with interchangeable lenses, the 14-42mm kit zoom shortchanges the G5 -- it would do better with a superior lens.

These Micro 4/3 cameras are absolutely the best = smaller, lighter, well priced and FABULOUS picture quality (of course not $15,000 magazine quality but who cares about 45mp shots???)I researched ALL the smaller APS and Micro 4/3 and mirrorless cameras for over a month - Fujis, Nikon, Canon, entire Sony line, enitre Olympus line and entire Panasonic line.  I was debating getting the Olympus OMD vs waiting for the Panasonic GX7 but did not know if I wanted to spend $1000 to $1500.

Worse would be I just sell it back out with no $$$ loss. So I bought a used version from Amazon.After 2 months of use, I LOVE THIS CAMERA.  What fun to use and what quality shots.  I have quickly acquired a bunch of used lenses for this micro 43 and even purchase the GX1 for $200. My wife always comments about what fantastic photos and especially videos come out of this camera.If you are just starting to look for a smaller, lighter mirrorles camera. I would absolutely recommend getting this camera first and then if you want all the bells and whistles or more functions or features, only then spend the $$$ and upgrade to the Olympus OMD or Panasonic G6 or GX7.Here is my thoughts and what I have done For $1100 budget:$320 G5 + 14-42mm Kit Lens (perhaps not the best but actually very good lens)$180 Panasonic 45 -150mm Second Generation lighter lens (GREAT quality) OR buy the 50-200mm (larger and heavier but great pics)$300 Panasonic 20mm F1.7 (LOVELY sharp low light lens but sort of slow / grinding focus - what a deal for the quality!)$300 Olympus 45mm $1.8 = MY FAVORITE lens. tack sharp, low light, portrait, amazing Bokeh = truly studio professional quality shots.I loved this camera so much I also purchased the GX1 to carry around in my work bag for $200.Here are Other Lenses I have purchased for my G5:$150 Panasonic 14mm F2.5 Nice wide angle and low apeture lense$20  Minolta MD mount to Micro 43 Adapter$100 Minolta 28mm F2.8$20 Minolta 45mm F2.0$50 Minolta 50mm F1.7$20 Nikon F Mount to Micro 43 Adapter$140 Nikon 50mm f1.4$100 Nikon 28mm f2.8$220 Nikon 55mm f2.8 Macro lens$700 Panasonic 14-140mm Super Zoom f3.5What a great lightweight all around lens that I take with me on travel.This lens + 20mm + G5 goes with me almost everywhere.They all fit in a small camera bag and covers all my shots.Alternative to $700 14-140 f3.5 is to get the same 14-140mm F4.0 lens for $400 BUT the older generation lens is about 2x heavier and 40% bulkier.I probably will upgrade to the GX7 once the price drops some in a year or 2.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R33289GZZ0UJFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As long as these cameras are still available for sale at a really low price, they are a pretty good deal.The major downside of this camera is that it feels really cheap, and that goes double for the kit lens that comes with it. (Panasonic introduced a new kit lens for the G6 model.) The thumbwheel is very difficult to turn; it gets stuck, and then when you get it to turn it turns multiple clicks. Very cheap. There's also a jog-lever near the shutter button that you can use instead of the wheel to change exposure, and it works better than the wheel, but my complaint is that the interface is also really slow and there's quite an annoyable delay between pushing the jog lever and seeing the EV value change in the viewscreen.If you want a camera with a decent built-in EVF, or even with a decent add-on EVF, you have to pay a lot more if you are buying the Olympus brand. Like the headline says, this camera is a good value. The \"G\" series has always been the best value in micro-four-thirds.  Panasonic cameras also have less purple fringing than Olympus cameras using the same lenses, and the implementation of spot focus is so much better on Panasonic. And on the G5, you can see both a level and a histogram at the same time in the live view. For some reason, Olympus is too lazy or something to implement that. And the level is only available on the more expensive Olympus cameras and not the inexpensive E-PM2.The touchscreen on the G2 is a pressure-sensitive one, so you won't like it as much as the capacitive touchscreen on Olympus cameras or newer Panasonic cameras.The menu options are a little limited. Want to change the default filenames? Sorry, can't do that.The camera is ugly because it looks like a little DSLR, but that ugliness also makes the camera very easy to hold steady, it has a very nice grip, much nicer than the more expensive Olympus m43 cameras.Some people complain that they don't like Panasonic JPEGS, but those people are too lazy to adjust the various JPEG settings.

The 45-150mm was decent but I sold both on ebay so I could get the H-FS14140K zoom. What a good combination with the G5. Some may say it defeats the purpose of having a camera with interchangeable lens options. But if you ever shoot a dance recital video, you want the versatility of the 14-140mm because you can't change lens in the middle of a dance. The camera is easy to use because most functions are similar to those on the FZ35. The touch screen is something to get used to. The touch function works decently well but don't expect iPhone like smoothness. One small complaint is that you can't attach a string to the lens cap and secure it to the strap so I'll be buying replacement caps when I drop a few on the road.

My previous camera was a well worn but thoroughly enjoyable Canon Powershot S2IS 'super-zoom'.  I chose the G5 because the dimensions (without lens) were similar, had an articulated LCD screen and could capture in RAW format.  If you don't need the articulated screen and want something smaller, the Panasonic GX1 is a good alternative.So far this is turning out to be an ideal 'gateway' camera, providing the simplicity of a point-and-shoot with the manual features needed when auto doesn't quite get it right.  I don't think I've used it long enough to give a good accounting of the quality of the images.  That said, I like what has come out of it so far, despite the much maligned kit and 45-150mm (H-FS45150K) lenses which I find acceptable.  One final note about image quality.  As good as the in-camera JPG engine is, I've started playing with RAW conversions and found remarkable how much more detail you can pull out of the same image.I've only docked a star because I'm bitter about the price drop (*smile*)... and that stupid USB port.

All have had their particular strong points compared with the competition, with relatively few negatives. This camera came with the bottom-end version of Panasonic's numerous mid-range zooms, the earliest 14-42mm lens (which I did not need), but the body was about a dollar cheaper with it compared with buying the body without it, so...;-) I did a quick check on the lens and found it more than acceptable optically. The lens was good to the corners by f8 at 14mm and usable at wider stops, and it was good to the corners at f5.6 at 25mm and also at 42mm. I sold it to a friend to offset some of the cost of the G5, but I first pointed out the common problem with it of having rough zooming action. I had been considering the GX1, but the G5 was less money with the built-in 1.4-megapixel EVF compared with the GX1 plus its similar-spec accessory EVF, and the video specs were better for the G5 (28Mbps 1080-60p video vs, 1080-60i derived from 30p and at a lower data-rate). I have not yet shot much video with the G5, but the first clips appear to be quite sharp, not a common thing with still cameras that can also shoot video, even very high-priced ones.

I saw this as a deal of the day and at 100 dollars off it seemed totally worth it. from what I was seeing online it look tiny compared to a regular dslr like my mothers eos cannon 30d.

The lens that comes with it is decent and provides simple zooming and seems to get a good picture. it comes with a battery, charger, lens, lens caps, a hood, a shoulder strap, the body itself and of course the manuals and what not. the lens cap is very cool compared to my mothers camera because it has center pressure points which make it a lot easier to get on of when using a hood on the lens. The camera can shoot 1080p 60fps in both avchd psh which writes at 28mb/s or a more friendly format like mp4. The build quality of this camera is very nice and feels solid in the hand. The touch screen works well but has its moments . The zoom was sticky at first but I kept spinning it back and forth to get it more broken in so to speak. The focus is electronic so the focus ring on the lens can spin around forever. The intelligent auto  mode is quite useful for a novice like me. The adjustable lcd is very useful and makes me wonder why i went so long with out one. the electronic viewfinder is very well made and quite useful. The on board effects seem kind of amateur at best.

I love that it has a viewfinder, as I think the idea of composing at arms length on a lcd screen that is barely visible on a bright day is ridiculous, and even in conditions where I can see it the instability adds to the likelihood of camera motion ruining an otherwise brilliant shot. Even better, the eye sensor prevents the lcd lighting up with the preview and distracting me like my Canon 40D's does. It took a little bit if roaming around through the menu and the digital owners manual - the paper version is so basic it really is just a waste of trees unless you have never used a camera of any kind before - to figure out where the settings I want/need are and the quickest way to access them, but now I'm up and running. I've still got a lot of tests I want to try, but so far the results have been far above my expectations. Can't wait to really put it to the test at the beach tomorrow evening, to see how it handles the various lowlight, reflection and action situations I have in mind.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great quality camera, big step up from point and shoot but not aas heavy / bulky as DSLR", "Author": "T.

You have to have your camera if you want to get a picture and I really did not want something as bulky as my wife's Nikon D40 but I did want really good pictures like her D40. I found this in the Amazon Warehouse Deals at a price that forced me to buy it.  The camera feels great withour being overy heavy of bulky.  The included 14-42mm lens does a good job with basic pictures but I need to zoom so I picked up a 175mm power-zoom lens which I use most of the time. The included lens is manual zoom which is no problem except that the smoothness of the zoom could be better.The bottom line is that I can put in a 32GB SD card and that holds about 3300 pictures at the highest resolution setting.

Just my observation. Backstory: not a professional or even skilled amateur.  I own the following in addition to this: Canon S100, Canon SX 210, Sony Alpha Nex F3 and several others a bit older. This machine works, delivers and if thoughtfully set up with kit or custom lens does the work. I have a kit 14-42 an two others, one fixed 35mm and one zoom 70-200. I upload to Photoshop CS6. I note that post processing for both stills and video becomes less a necessity.  By working with this machine, i.e. taking lots of video, lots of stills, I am engaging the pre-processing tools built into the camera, which, as noted by an amateur, appear to produce very powerful and positive results.  When I upload to Photoshop, there is often little left to be done.  In addition, the price point on this machine is very desireable as it has drop greater than 20% since my may 2013 purchase.  Its big brother sister the GH3 offers even more professional results but at a considerably higher price point.  The GH3 appears to be a significant addition to the Lumix line up.  The G5 is remarkably close in many aspects when you line up, side by side, the technical specifications of each camera.As to my personal experience, being vision challenged, I fin both the electronic viewfinder and the tiltable and reversible 3\" LCD dscreen to be virtually useful in every weather scenario I have encountered, short of a direct hit tornado.

I could easily take pictures with one hand, although I never do, and the camera does take amazing pictures when paired with the extremely economical Sigma EX DN 30mm F2.8 prime lens.As far as cons go, the camera is limited to 30 minutes of video (even with the US model) which is extremely irritating as I was planning on using this camera to take time-lapse videos. Another irritating point is that the camera does not support auto-exposure lock for videos, which I believe there is no excuse for aside from handicapping this camera so customers are inclined to spend another $800 in order to get the GH3 with all the video bells and whistles.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not quite there", "Author": "now what", "ReviewID": "RRBFJN485N3V6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera because I wanted something lighter than my K-5, with a larger sensor and greater resolution than my FZ150.  I wanted decent burst speed and depth, good tele capabilities, and good IQ.  In theory the G5 fit the bill, although the burst function wasn't as good as either of the above cameras.  But I was willing to accept that as part of the trade-off in size, weight and sensor.Initial impressions:--The body is synthetic material, but feels strong and solid.  Kevlar is synthetic, too, and it stops bullets.--Much lighter than a DLSR like, say, the K-5, or even the K-r.  With lens attached, heavier than my FZ150, but not enough to really notice.--Made in China (lens made in Japan).  China makes the world's fastest bullet train, the world's fastest electric-powered car, and a lot of other good stuff.  So the \"made in China\" label doesn't worry me and I'm not going to blame anything on the supposed inherent defects in Chinese manufacture (something often seen on Amazon camera review pages).  They get the specs from Pany.--Not flat like, say, the NEX cameras, but for me the curves make it easier to grip and use.--From the rear and from the top (or from the bottom), amazingly similar in size and profile to the FZ150.--The location of various switches (On-Off, exposure toggle) is a little odd compared to previous and current cameras I have owned/own, but I imagine I'll get used to it.--Eyepiece is very nice size.--Fully articulated LCD screen is good, although a bit small.Bad:--Lens cap works well, but no string or thread to attach it to the camera with?  This is basic.  Charge me another 5 cents and give me something truly functional.--160 minimum 1SO will require forgetting all the situation & exposure settings that I've learned from years of working with cameras with ISO 100 as the baseline.--The control dial and buttons look cheap and tinny, and the control dial feels that way.--The 4-way controller (ISO, WB, Macro, Burst/Timer) is chrome on chrome, which makes it impossible to read.  Every other camera I've ever owned was white lettering/icons on black.  There is absolutely nothing good about this distinctive approach.--Exposure via a lever instead of a wheel is going to take some getting used to.  Also the display is counterintuitive and will take more getting used to.  Not sure what Pany thought could be accomplished by this approach.--Minimalist approach to info display (exposure, etc.) is hard to read.So far, I don't find it very easy to work with compared to most (all) of the other cameras, from old Canon P&S;, a variety of bridge cameras and DSLRs of various brands.Functioning and IQ:I should make it clear that I push cameras in terms of using maximum zoom, shooting in very high-contrast situations, and action.  For someone who does other things, this camera may be totally different.  For example, I rarely shoot in low light and this may be a strong point of this camera.  So far I haven't tested the low light capabilities.--Burst depth at high speed (SDHC Class 10 card) was 16 frames before slowing down.  RAW burst depth at any speed was 8 frames.  This is a bit less than expected from online reviews (18 and 9 frames)Images:-- \"Easy\" shots (no extremes of contrast and lighting, well-defined edges, not a lot of detail) are very good.--Images with the 45-200 lens are pretty bad.  Not only soft, but edges in areas of fine detail and high contrast are choppy both in JPEG and RAW.  Foliage tends to have a paintbrush effect.  My FZ150 does better, to say nothing of the 55-300mm kit lens on my K-r, an APS-C 12mp camera.--In many ways I was more impressed with the ZS15 and the LF1.So now I have to decide if I want to return the lens, hope that was the problem, but still end up with a camera that is in many ways less comfortable and effective than my FZ150, to say nothing of the K-5.  I may wait for the Fuji X-E2.-----------------------------UPDATE 11-17-2013I decided to go for a major upgrade.  I returned the camera and lenses (best to start clean) and ordered a GH3, which is due to arrive in a couple of days. Also ordered a 14-140mm for a walk-around lens and a 100-300mm for long-distance surfing images. Both Panasonic. For video I have my eye on the power zoom 45-175mm, but we'll see about that one.After a lot of research, I went with the GH3 because I'm getting more into hybrid photography and want solid video capability as well as good IQ in stills. Burst speed is only 6fps (which I find is minimal but acceptable for most action that I shoot) but the JPEG burst depth is somewhere around 100 frames (depending on the card used) and the RAW is about 18 (one test achieved 24 with a super-fast card) so I think I'm winning on that score.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Product", "Author": "or", "ReviewID": "R29EUUPCO2KCH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very Good Product, the camera is small and very lighweight even with the Panasonic 45-200 lens attached.

Another great feature is the ability to take pictures while filming!!!Now, the deal breaker to me was, there is no auto zoom while filming:( It is impossible to zoom in while filming without moving the camera! The parts of the movie where I was zooming in or out came out shaking, even grinding and clicking noise from the lens moving in and out was to hear in the movie!It was also upsetting that only 5 days after I  purchased it, the price came down to $499. Over $100 less than I paid. Amazon would not price match ( I might have kept it for hat money and use something else for movies.......

The main reason for buying this one was to get good performance without having to lug around a heavy dSLR, and the price was right ($300 in a Lightning Deal). I liked the idea of having a viewfinder to use at times when framing a shot with the LCD was difficult due to conditions.What I failed to recall was how much I dislike electronic viewfinders. Confirming focus sucks and the viewfinder image is rarely accurate. These should in no way be though of as equivalent to a mirrored viewfinder without the delay or mirror flap. They don't even come close. The closest these come to dSLRs is in appearance.On the plus side, this camera has a lot of nice features. It has an articulating touch screen LCD, giving you multiple ways to select options or adjustments. Lots of settings that don't require a PhD to learn to use. Burst mode, bracketing, color balance, exposure compensation, etc.The lens gives you a nice range. I don't like that they never give 35mm equivalents anymore, but this lens translates to something like 28-85mm focal length (plus digital zoom to get a little closer on the tele side).I like other Lumix cameras as the lenses are made by Leica. This one isn't, but seems quite capable coupled with a high resolution sensor.At regular prices, I'd recommend taking a look at the lower priced dSLRs from Canon or Nikon.

Whatever DSLR you go with, you will need either a 40mm or 50mm lens for good indoor photos.Pros: The camera body is lightweight but still sturdy and is small enough to fit comfortably in a backpack or diaper bag. The menus make it easy to use right out of the box.Cons: The zoom is \"sticky\" as described by other reviewers. Intelligent auto mode is not as easy to use as a point and click. The special artistic modes are not as easy to use as I'd hoped (at least not to create a printable-worthy photo).Bottom-line: I did not feel I could take a quality photo right out of the box (as I could with the camera I bought after returning this one) and I would not recommend this for a first-time DSLR user because of the difficulty with proper focusing..

I have been searching for a good mirrorless camera and found the deal on Amazon to be good and bought this camera with kit lens 14-42 + 45-150 lens. Once the product arrived, I was eager to use that, but was disappointed at the quality of the kit lens. While I have no complaints about the camera, the stiff and jerky zoom ring on the 14-42 kit lens makes this unusable for me.The zoom ring is so stiff that the picture in the camera shakes whenever you try to zoom in or zoom out. Not a very good feeling when you are using a $500 camera. Videos using this lens are a joke. I have searched on internet and found that this is a design problem of this lens and some people have given suggestion to work on the zoom ring at least 10 minutes a day so that it will loosen up. WTH !!So after purchasing this camera, I had three options -a. Keep using the 14-42 mm lens and get adjusted to the stiff zoom ring and the shakes it gives whenever you use the zoomb.

Willoughby", "ReviewID": "RDMHV5NYG2ZZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a G3 and love it. The G5 is very similar and appears to be an evolutionary model. The reviews I've read of the G5 sound very interesting, especially the enhanced resolution of the LCD display. Panasonic has done a great job in their MFT line. However, just for thought, the G3 is still available and has almost all the features of the G5. The last time I looked the kit price was down to $499 for the G3, $300 less than the G5... That would cover the price of a lot of accessories. Definitely worth considering while it lasts!Either way you go, G3 or G5, especially if you're coming from a PAS, the camera is such a treat. I got the 45-200mm lens to compliment the kit lens and I've had great fun with it. We're now thinking of vacations in terms of photo tours, and with tools like Lightroom 4 or Photoshop Elements 10, you can spend hours creatively putting together journals of memories with photo quality that is fantastic. Take a look at an HDR package like Picturenaut (free) or Photomatix ($99 list), too.I'd recommend a couple of inexpensive extras. First, macro extension tubes for extreme close-ups. About $12 from Fotodiox. Fun stuff. Also get a 52mm UV filter mostly to protect the lens, and a circular polarizing filter. And extra batteries. The battery life is pretty slim between charges. I ordered the Wasabi set with 2 batteries and a charger for the G3 for about 30 bucks. I'm sure there will be aftermarket batteries for the G5, too. Finally, get a decent camera bag (I personally prefer a sling-type).Happy shooting!", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "I returned it", "Author": "Daniel Miramontes", "ReviewID": "R316C1Q1QHZOSG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As for this camera I thought It was cheaper quality than the GX1 and this one is suppose to be better, everyone raves about the better grip.... but It was strange, it was bigger!!! that is for sure but it made you scrunch up your fingers up top to be able to change the aperture/shutter, and then also be able to press the shutter release. The rubber felt cheap, and the view finder was completely cheaper than the detachable one on the GX1. The overall feel of the camera is of a camera worth much less than the price its sold for. ( * I'm comparing it to the GX1 because its a Pany that I enjoy using) I was extremely disappointed and completely disliked this camera, It had to go!

Little more could be said for the 45-150 although it was a bit smoother. The controls on the body felt cheap. The control wheels were jerky and stiff. Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a precision piece of equipment.What ticked me off was the attitude of customer no service. They told me they would call me back within 2 hours. That never happened. When I called to followup there was no record in the case that there was to be any follow-up. The second customer service could have cared less.Thank goodness for Amazon's consumer friendly return policy.
