The camera is compact, takes great pictures and offers settings that really allow you to take extraordinary pictures in less then optimal situations, feels good to hold and is nicely weighted.Focus Camera on the other hand specializes in an about every attribute you can think of that is a reason for not buying from someone. Bad communication, shipped the wrong items in the order, failed to communicate in a reasonable amount of time after the problems came to light and then finally offered meaningless and irrelevant assistance after the fact. Avoid these people at all costs even if it costs a little more to do business with someone else.But as almost always, Amazon.com was there to save the day and provided the kind of Customer Service that you expect and took care of the issues quickly and competently.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Kathy P.", "ReviewID": "R29JUMQLQNO9KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We haven't had the camera long but very happy with its performance so far.

However, I was very disappointed.1. the image quality was nowhere near as good as my 3 year old Nex 5 which only has 14MP  WX300 produced grainy image in-door well-lit with or without flash. without flash, it produces even worse image2. very slow saving files, it takes 2-3 seconds to save an image. tested with a class10 SD card came with kit, and a class10 SD i'm using with my nex5 camera. the results are the same, so I know it's not due to the SD card rating.skip this camera, spend a little extra for an exchangeable lens system. BTW,  the kit I received, did not come with the accessory kit or the cleaning cloth; only the SD and camera case.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$328.00", "Features": "Capture breathtaking images, get close with 20x zoom.\nImage stabilization reduces blur.<li>Crisp, beautiful HD videos.\nShare instantly with built-in Wi-Fi.\nBig-time battery life; Captures up to 500 photos on a single charge.", "Name": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX300/B 18.2 MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black) + Sony 16GB SDHC Memory Card + Sony Camera Case + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51k21o5TVqL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CIWIPAK"}}
