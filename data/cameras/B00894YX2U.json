{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great upgrade over other Rebels", "Author": "E. Reed", "ReviewID": "R256NK40V28NOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this long awesome review and Amazon lost it of course. So here goes a second try.This is my second Canon camera. Previously I have owned Olympus and Minolta cameras. I owned a t2i before this and used a t3i for weeks for testing purposes. I will try to cover most aspects of the new features and image quality. For testing purposes I used a Canon 17-40L lens.Look and Feel:Not much to say here for the look of the camera. Looks almost the exact same as the t2i, t3i. The battery grip and accessories all fit the same. One thing that is different from the t2i is the proximity sensor. On the t2i it was below the optical viewfinder and above the screen. On the t4i it is above the optical viewfinder. I use an eyecup(http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y06336)and it used to make the screen shut off on its own regularly on the t2i. This is a non issue for the t4i. There is also an added dedicated movie button in the power switch now.Feel is a little different. The t4i feels more sturdy than the previous two rebels. The buttons are more solid and the selector wheels are improved. The adjustment wheel has better clicks and don't feel like you could easily flick it and change a setting by accident. The mode selector wheel is sturdier as well. I notice this because my t2i used to regularly switch to A-DEP mode when I would pull the camera out of my bag and I would get upset if I missed a quick shot because of it. I feel this will be a non issue with the new model. One issue I have is using my eyecup mentioned previously. The flippy screen catches on this and is just a slight annoyance but not a huge deal in the grand scheme. The rebel series always felt a bit small in the hand for me so I now use a battery grip which adds weight and substance to the camera.Touchscreen:When I saw rumors that the t4i would have a touchscreen I first said I wouldn't buy it. I figured this would be a gimmick and offer limited functionality. Then when i saw the press release and videos from Canon I changed my mind. I was sceptic of a couple things I will address here. I will start with the touch to adjust. Right now I feel kind of wonky using the touchscreen to make most adjustments to shooting in manual mode which is all i shoot in. But I consider this like moving from a blackberry to an iPhone. You are used to using buttons and the keyboard for so long you are lost on the touchscreen at first, but with time it ends up faster and easier. So in time it will end up faster for me to adjust by touch I am sure. It is in two spots already. ISO adjusting always seemed kind of odd to me on the rebel. The ISO button was placed so you had to kind of search for it and then do a three button combo to set it. On the touchscreen I find this easier. A couple taps and its done. The other major place it's easier for me is AEB. Bracketing on Canon is typically a pain. Hit menu, find the exposure selector, hit OK. Slide the wheel, hit OK again then press menu. On touchscreen you just press the exposure and tap a couple times to set the bracket.Touch to focus was something that I didn't see coming from Canon. When they announced it my thought was it would be OK but nothing great. I figured it would be where you would touch on one of the 9 AF points you would like the camera to use. But thanks to the hybrid CMOS on the camera, it is truly a touch to focus. No matter where in the frame you press the camera will seek out and quickly focus on that area. This function works much better than I anticipated and I may use it in the future. At first I figured this would be a selling point for soccer moms but I was incorrect. I have not used the face detection follow focus to comment on it yet.Image Quality:This is the most important thing in the end when you buy any camera. How will my images look? The t4i does not disappoint. Thanks to improvements in the processor, focus, sensor and noise reduction software the t4i simply crushes the previous rebel cameras. We can start with the White balance. On the previous rebels and even the 60d, white balance was not so great. A yellow or tan-ish hue was almost always present and reds were soft. Canon has addressed this issue and images are clear and cary a nice contrast throughout the image. Auto focus I have touched on. Moving from 1 to 9 cross type AF points and a new added contrast detection sensor for AF makes a world of difference. Focus is fast and true and doesn't waste time seeking as much as before. In live view mode in low light, the digic4 and old sensors were pretty bad. A lot of seeking and misplaced focal areas. This is greatly improved with this model. Because of these reasons if you shoot in auto focus or any auto mode on the camera your images will turn out better.Low Light/High ISO:When the digic 5 was announced Canon touted this as being able to provide up to 75% better image quality over the digic 4. Of course I didn't buy into this because it's Canon and they were there to sell you. With the t4i Canon added the digic 5 as well as some new noise reduction software to boot. How did it make out? I tested these things against a Canon 60D. Same lens, same settings. In RAW at ISO 6400 the image quality looked at least twice as good over the 60D in terms of noise. At 12800 its laughable. That being said, on my t2i I would not use an image over ISO 1600 to print or display or sell. On the t4i I would gladly use ISO 3200 and at times 6400. Auto focus is so much improved at high ISO and low light that it's one of the first things you notice when comparing the camera to the 60D.Battery life: Have not used it a full day to test yet. I imagine if you use full time AF it will go down slightly from the previous models.Other Additions:Scene Intelligent Auto....Used for one shot. Seemed to be OK but I am a manual shooter. I am sure this would work well for most beginners.Handheld Night Scene....This takes 4 quick shots in a row and then in the camera combines them to reduce shake and noise. At 6400 ISO the image did result in less noise over standard shooting in RAW. This mode can only be done in JPG. I can see it being very good indoors at functions or for quick night shots outside.HDR Backlight Control....This will do in camera HDR. It takes three shots of various exposure and combines them to improve highlight and shadow detail.This worked well and didn't produce too much noise in low light. It does not produce an image that people now days think of in HDR with blown out tones and surreal feeling to it. It is more traditional in where it just makes shadows appear less and corrects some blowing out by brighter lights in a frame. Works well for what its supposed to be. Also only available in JPGAutofocus during video...Worked well and somewhat fast with my 17-40. Still allowed some noise from the lens searching for focus, but I wasn't using one of the STM lenses designed for this function.EDIT: Since my initial review I have had a chance to test video with an STM lens and try out the face follow focus. The STM lens does improve focus speed quite a bit in video and is much quieter. There is still a little noise but may be something you don't notice depending on the scene you are shooting. Face follow focus works better than I thought it would. It can actually focus on an object as well as just faces. It follows through the frame very well and precise even in low light. It's nto super fast to focus but still works well.PROS:Outstanding Image Quality. Even at higher ISOTouchscreenEase Of Use5 Frames Per Second ShootingAuto FocusCONS:Built in stereo mic is kind of pointless unless you use an STM lens. Maybe even then.The bezel around the touchscreen is uneven, but that has nothing to do with function. It's just poor design.Learning curve on the touchscreenFeature guide...It makes touchscreen control unbearable. Just disable it as soon as you turn the camera on and save yourself the frustration of being told why you need to change ISO every time you touch the button for it.FINAL WORD:If you were holding back or looking for a reason to upgrade your digic 4 based camera this is the one you are looking for. Compared to the t2i/t3i/60D this camera will offer you better image quality, focus, low light performance and ease of use. Yes the 60D is an \"upgrade\" over the rebel line but as of now, you'd only gain size, weight and one stop of shutter speed over the t4i with the 60D. With the t4i you'd gain better images, video, high ISO performance, touchscreen, shutter lag and a few other things. This camera offers many new technologies and additions from Canon that aren't seen on any other camera in their line up. If you are a beginner or someone with a previous rebel looking for a nice camera you will find this camera to offer many things that you will enjoy in a first camera or an upgrade. This camera can make your photos better by taking the same photos as you would have with the previous models just with the improvements and that is what you should look for. The t3i was a small upgrade form the t2i and Canon has made up for it with this rebel.If you do own or buy this camera join the flickr group we have made.

Thompson", "ReviewID": "R37KU6N8NNUKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had my T3i for about 8 months when this came out but I read the details and decided to pre-order. The new T4i just arrived today (body only) and I've been playing around with it all afternoon using my 50mm 1.4 lens.All I can say so far is WOW - I'm very impressed with the upgraded autofocus, the touchscreen, as well as the new focus selection methods. There is a LOT less delay when you move the camera and what you see on the screen in Live Mode. Live Mode is MUCH \"snappier\" feeling. When you turned on the T3i in Live Mode, it would have a little rectangle you could move around the screen to make sure the camera was focusing on what you wanted. But with the T4i, this system is much more versatile. You can tap the screen to instantly set a focus point, or you can move the little box around (which is much smaller and more precise now - and it will also FOLLOW your focus point when you move the camera around!), or you can allow for a more \"general focus\" by getting rid of the little box and letting the camera choose how it wants to focus, similar to how it works when using only the viewfinder to take photos. When you do the \"general focus\", a bunch of little boxes appear on the screen letting you know exactly which parts of the photo are in sharp focus - the T3i did not do this and only relied on the positioning of the focus box.The continuous autofocus during video worked very well on my 50mm 1.4 lens - sure, the focus motor was a little noisy, but if you're taking scenic shots or something where you'll be replacing the audio with music anyway, motor noise is a non-issue. If you're doing interviews where the person is talking into a lav mic, it still won't be an issue because the lav mic will be too far away to pick up the motor noise. Motor noise is only an issue if you're using the built in mic, which I would regard as an \"emergency only\" mic anyway.So all this means that you do NOT need an STM lens to use continuous autofocus - the main purpose of the STM technology as I understand it is to make autofocus FASTER and QUIET. Video autofocus with my 50mm 1.4 is what I would call \"fast enough\" - meaning, it is a bit slow compared to a camcorder (and noticeable on-screen), but not so slow that it should distract my viewers from the content too much. The only time continuous autofocus won't serve you very well is in dark rooms where it can't lock on to anything very quickly. My 50mm 1.4 lens hunted for focus in very dark areas so in situations like that I would manual focus.Video is excellent quality as always. If you're used to the T3i video, this is just as stellar and tends to make people and scenes look better than they do in real life (when using the 50mm 1.4 at least) - They've moved the video mode to be part of the on/off switch instead of on the mode dial which is where it was on the T3i. This allows you to pick a mode on the dial and then turn on video straight from there and make use of those settings. So you can do full auto exposure video, full manual exposure video, or Program Mode video very easily.I also love the increased ISO to 12800 and the ability for the camera to take multiple exposures and combine them to help eliminate noise and camera shake. This works very well for my purposes. It's a small thing but something I've not noticed anyone else talking about is how much BETTER the shutter sounds. Somehow it's more satisfying and reminds me of the more expensive cameras.HDR Mode: I've uploaded some of this camera's HDR photos to the image section on this page so you can see how well it did combining 3 photos at 3 different exposures - the T4i can do this in camera with no software needed. It takes 3 quick photos and processes them for a few seconds and then the result is the image you see. The 3 originals do not get saved. To save them, you would have to use manual exposure bracketing which this camera does quite well. When using HDR mode, you only have to worry about getting proper focus and then everything else is taken care of for you. Some of the images can come out looking a little weird, but if you take 2 or 3 different versions at different focal points, you should get at least one that looks very nice and detailed with lighting that doesn't look too cartoony. One thing that surprised me was how, in one of my photos, a car unexpectedly entered the scene while it was taking the 3 shots. The resulting image had NO car at all. Pretty cool.CONS: So far, the only thing I DON'T like about the cam are the buttons - somehow they feel cheaper and more fragile than on the T3i. I'll update this if I discover anything else not up to par.Overall, I love the camera and am very happy with my upgrade over the T3i. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the new STM lenses can do.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok, I guess I know what you're looking for in this review...", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"alex sally\"", "ReviewID": "R1EJHKWAWQYQF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You're thinking of getting the t4i, reading the reviews, comparing it to the t3i and countless others and pulling your hair out at all the pros and cons? Am I close? I'm a photographer and have used this, the t3i and its sony equivalent. I might be able to help. Here's hoping :) Let me start with an anecdote, (you've read enough technical jargon for now so consider this a breather)I film  eagles on the isle of Mull in the Scottish hebrides and the landlady I stay with was telling me about this other photographer who visits her little cottage (it's beautiful by the way, you should visit if you get the chance). So anyway, she is cooking tea , as she does if you ask her nicely. While it's cooking he shows her one of his photos, probably of a sea eagle catching a fish. Everyone wants to photograph one of those even though its on every other postcard in Scotland. Next to a highland cow looking over a gate its the top photo/cliche to get.. Anyhoo, she looks at the photo and says \"wow that's great...you must have a brilliant camera\" .So they sit down for supper a bit later and its delicious, she is a great cook. He says \"This is lovely...you must have some great saucepans!\" boom boom.But herein lies the real point of this camera. You know its the person behind the camera that takes the pictures but do you really know it? This and the t3i take pictures so good (if you have the skill) you could blow it up the size of front door but are you going to want to. The thing no sellers want to tell you is that for years, maybe 5 , all of the big names have been making great dslr. Since the nikon d40 perhaps. But you really want to know, if you bought this, would you be happy or buying a pup. Be reassured that neither canon, nikon or sony make chocolate teapots. They know how to make a great camera and this is one. It's biggest difference as you will have read ad nauseum , is the touch screen. is it worth it. It is if you like touch screens (I do). That's not flippant, it's how it is.So the photos will be great and its a great camera, you've read other reviews so I won't duplicate what you have already read but one thing you may not have read is about the video. All the makers have got dslr right. No pups in sight, but video is a relatively new feature and Sony have tbh been leading the way. This camera sets to rectify that by having autofocus. A lot of places on the net, say it's not needed, you should be using manual focus. Nonsense. Manual focus is ok at times but can be a pain. Filming your dog on the beach for example..The autofocus on the t4i is actually pretty good. Not as good as a camcorder but pretty good. The slowest part is for it to get going. But when it's locked on its sound. Well worth having. So thats sorted right..err no, not really. This is the 650d 's killer feature. Trouble is, they left out the killer feature on the 600d. The 3x zoom with \"no loss in quality\". So here is the choice if you are buying this for video.if you want you're 300mm zoom to be able to zoom to 900mm for filming sport or wildlife. It's the t3i for you.If you love the idea of autofocus (or hate the idea of doing it the old fashioned way) its the t4i for you.In my opinion if you're considering the other makes like Sony, it comes down to who makes the the lens you are likely to want. I know I have focused (blabbed on) about video but hey, there has been thousands of photo reviews already about iso , shutter speed etc etc. Nothing for me to add there!So if you are considering using it for video here are a few \"must have\" things you will need to go with it.Velbon DV7000 3-Section Ultra Heavy Duty Tripod with Geared Center Column, 2-Way Fluid Head and QB-6RL Quick Shoe, Max Height 64-inch, Supports 9.9 lbs58mm HMC Ultraviolet UV(C) Haze Multicoated Filter  Doesn't have to be this particular one but hey..Oh and the one that should have gone top of my listMake better videos with your dslr or camcorder (gives details of the counter intuitive settings that actually work best :)  )So now I have spent ten minutes typing away, telling you how I like the t4i for video (I do) do me a little favour and click that you find this helpful. Unless you don't. Either way you will enjoy this camera but do consider the little brother the t3i also. We live in good times to take photos as there are so many great cameras and this is definitely one of them. One more thing I forgot to mention (and yes it is regarding the video) is that to get great video you need to use the right settings in the menu. Unfortunately these are counter intuitive and if you don't use them you may be under whelmed. If anyone wants them, comment and I will try to post a link", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "A review with sample pictures", "Author": "Henry N. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "RCCMHEEOXZGHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from Canon T1i to Canon T4i.  Having this T4i camera for 3 days and taking more than 1,000 pictures in different modes and environments, I want to write a few words for other fellows.The main reasons for my upgrade are: 1) 9 cross-type focusing points; 2) Faster shooting burst rate; 3) Continuous video focusing; 4) Touch screen (very useful features).  The picture quality is from very good to excellent.  Color tone is realistic.  Pictures from T4i camera look better than pictures from T1i camera in term of white balance and sharpness (probably from the benefits of 9 cross-type focus points).  It is definitely more snappy in sport mode, focusing is fast and burst rate is good.  I do like the continuous focusing feature in the video mode because of the convenience.  It takes between 1 - 2 second to focus to new scene and you can hear the focusing noise from the lense.  Definitely, there are rooms for improvement (faster focusing and reduce the motor noise during focusing) in video feature.  I don't have the new Canon STM lense, so I don't know if it is quite or not.This camera is good enough as an entry level and for people who to upgrade from their point-and-shoot cameras.Link to some sample pictures that I took with my Canon T4i camera (go to flickr.com and search under tags only for henrynnguyen).  I uploaded the orginal picture size (3456x5184 pixels), but the flickr.com reduced the picture size to 1365x2048 pixels.  Hopefully that you still have a sense of how the picture quality look.  Most of my pictures were taken in raw format, then converted to jpeg format using Canon provided software. The lenses that I used were Canon 50mm F1.4 USM and Canon 28-70mm F2.8 L series.  The memory card is ScanDisk 32GB, UHS-1 rated.  The Canon T4i camera performs as advertised by Canon.  My main interests are accurate and fast focusing with high burst rate (who is not???).  Overall, this is a very good entry dSLR camera.  So, I am happy with the product and intend to keep it.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "DEFINITE UPGRADE TO THE T3i! (Correction made regarding the digital Zoom)", "Author": "T3iEnthusiast", "ReviewID": "R2CST71N6MNB0X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the T3i and absolutely love the camera. Its feature packed and has incredible image quality. I recently purchased the T4i (body only) and was thoroughly impressed with the first press of the shutter!Cross Type Focal Points:Not only is the shutter quieter and faster than the T3i's, the enhanced cross type focusing on all points combined with the new image sensor is WAY FASTER and MORE ACCURATE than the already good but not great T3i. I rarely use the outer focal points on the T3i because the focusing is slow and unreliable, its always been center point or manual focus for me.  Not so on the T4i! Super fast focusing on all points and great image quality!Touch Screen:Excellent addition to any DSLR and it works wonderfully! Everything you can do from the Main Menu button on the T3i and the Quick Menu button can be done through the Touchscreen's interface on the T4i. EVERYTHING!Constant Auto Focus:I tested this feature with my existing lenses and yes, you do notice the hunting and hear the autofocus motor (which will vary from lens to lens) but I have not tested it with the new 4omm or the new 18-135 STM lenses, yet.Custom White Balance:I believe this is new or I just never used it on my T3i. A very nice grid displays from the Quick Menu that allows you to set a custom white balance. No, this is not just selecting AWB from the white balance options, thats still available but the custom piece appears to be a new feature. (I could very well be wrong about that one)The ADEP option has been removed from the dial. I rarely used it but it was nice having the foreground and background in focus option available in the 'manual' region of the dial.UPDATED/CORRECTED INFO:Earlier I made a correction regarding the lack of digital zoom. Well, the final correction to my previous correction is this, there is in fact no digital zoom. At least none I can find that is recordable while in video mode. You are still able to zoom in and essentially magnify a selected area but when you begin your recording the cropped or zoomed area goes away and your standard focal length will be recorded.The viewfinder has a slight amber color as opposed to the bluish hue on the T3i. I can't say I see if this is a benefit or not but its worthy of mentioning for those doing research.A friend asked me how much I think the T4i is better than the T3i. The only answer I had was this, \"I was considering getting a 60D to take advantage of the faster shutter and better focusing (9 point cross type). Seeing how well those improvements on the T4i work, I forgot all about the 60D!\" I know the 60D is better built and has a better/larger viewfinder but for my money, the T4i fit the bill!These are things I've found to be improvements and overall nice features about the T4i but you should do as much research as possible. DPreview . com is an excellent site for camera gear information but the last time I checked they did not have a hands on review, only some canned information from Canon. Another great, I MEAN GREAT site is The-Digital-Picture . com. Again, too new for a review to be there but I encourage you to go there, absorb and be a well informed consumer and a better photographer!Now I wonder if that 70D rumor is true.....", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, esp. with 18-135 STM lens", "Author": "DrinkSomeBCBS", "ReviewID": "R7BOVK8CMVURB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera through Amazon and the lens through Canon, so I do have both.I've been doing a lot of research into cameras the past couple months in order to choose one that fits our needs. I was glad I waited until the T4i was released before I made a decision. I'll admit I have limited use of this camera and lens so far (only had it three days and it's a present to my wife). It's our first DSLR and our only experience taking pictures is with point-and-shoots and our phones. During my research, I considered the T3i, T4i, 60D, 7D (refurbished), and their complementary Nikon counterparts.Why did I get the T4i?- I'm a bit of a gadget junkie while my wife is not. The T4i allows her to pick up the camera and take better quality pictures, while affording me the ability to learn more about photography and move to manual settings. While I learn, I too can use the camera in auto mode and use the screen tips to assist me.- The touch screen was a big factor. While my wife isn't a techie or first adopter, she is used to using her iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad to navigate and manipulate. The touch screen on the camera is something that will feel familiar to her and reduce the learning curve. I myself have no fear of buttons and menus, but I even see myself using the touch screen more because it felt more convenient.- We needed an all-in-one camera for still photos and videos. We are expecting our first child, which is what prompted us to upgrade to a better camera. I could have purchased a higher-end camera for stills and supplemented it with a camcorder, but I know we don't want to lug around more equipment. Having two pieces of equipment also means we will probably be looking for the right one while we lose the shot. The video capabilities of the T4i seem to be adequate enough to handle our video needs, while having a camera that is excellent for still photos.- The STM lenses should help the convenience factor of shooting video with a DSLR. I was excited about the new STM lenses, because I have seen many examples of how loud a lens is on video. I also appreciate the autofocus abilities because I feel this will be more useful to my wife and myself. I know my wife will just want to be able to pick up the camera and start shooting. I will also be able to try my hand at manually focusing during video when I feel I am knowledgeable/skillful enough to do so, yet still have a decent enough autofocus available.- The price premium over the T3i wasn't a big factor (though I wish the kit with the 18-135 lens had come out before I HAD to buy; I didn't like having to pay a premium just for the lens, but this was a birthday present and I wanted the whole package ready to go). I think spending a little more to get the camera that is better suited for multiple users was just fine and the price point is in line with other Rebels at their release.- I really wanted the 18-135mm lens. When testing out the 18-55mm lens, I knew we would need something with more reach. The last thing we are going to want to do is carry around multiple lenses along with all our baby gear (though I am going to put the 40mm pancake on my wish list). Image quality appears excellent and will definitely serve our purposes.Why didn't I give it 5 stars?- Size/Feel: I have big hands and it feels small to me (my wife has small hands so it will probably be just right for her). The plastic case feels cheap, almost like a toy. Finally, menu buttons don't have good tactile feedback. For something that spends so much time in your hands, how it feels is a big factor to me. The reasons why I DID buy the camera trump this, though.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Low light performance? I'll just keep my T3i", "Author": "Art P", "ReviewID": "RH7RDAZ8C0EV7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to love the T4i and bought one as soon as it was made available. Most of the new features of the T4i are for \"point-n-shooters\" who want the camera to do all the thinking for them (there's nothing wrong with that); However, I shoot manual most of the time so these features are not a selling point for me.The touch screen was nice and so was the swipe & pinch-to-zoom feature for reviewing your photos, the \"tilty swively\" feature is also a great carryover from the T3i. I agree with another reviewer that mentioned the shutter sound has a more \"professional\" feel to it. I really liked the 5fps, it is a significant step up from 3.7fps; however, the buffer size was not increased accordingly so the camera can take 5-6 RAW images before the cache is full and needs to clear out. Once the cache is full it takes about 5-7 seconds to clear; This was using a 32Gb Sandisk Class 10 (35Mb/s) SD card. Sports shooters might want to think about this one.I usually only use the center focus point and recompose my shot, so I don't really need all the hybrid focus points, though you will definitely appreciate them if you shoot anything in motion and/or you leave it to the camera to determine the focus point.So why did I return the T4i and decide to stick with my T3i? It all has to do with the improvements (of lack thereof) that actually matter at the end of the day (for me). The biggest let down was that the T4i does not perform any better in low light than the T3i. Yes, it has a new Digic5 and higher ISO capability, but in reality the T4i and T3i are equally noisy at each ISO level over 400, and at 12800 the T4i's images are so noisy that I didn't know if I should laugh or cry...it is a huge let down :-(I was really hoping that this ONE area would be improved upon by the new Digic5 (heck I would trade in all the other new features for this one alone), but I guess it was too much to hope for. If you shoot weddings, events, indoor sports, or anything where the lighting is not optimal, you can save yourself a few dollars and go with a T3i, they are aesthetically identical and feel the same in your hand. I was trying to avoid forking out the money for a full frame body, but I guess I'm going to have to...gulp!", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Pictures and Video!", "Author": "Random Rebel", "ReviewID": "R2IAI08V2CYFFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I returned my T3i to Best Buy and got the T4i straight from here with the 18-55mm lens kit. I have to say that so far, I'm greatly impressed by the improvements over its predecessor. The touch screen alone is worth the extra pay making it easy to view photos and change settings without the worry of buttons. The feature guide was far from intuitive and caused a lot of clutter when in live-view mode. However, this is easily disabled. The Manual is very comprehensive and offers many tips for amateurs and even for more intermediate photographers like me. The video autofocus isn't as snappy as advertised. BUT This is also because of the lens. The 18-55mm lens isn't as quick to autofocus in video as the canon 50mm f2.8 or even the canon 40mm f1.8. I greatly recommend either of these lenses to accompany the camera body. If you aren't willing to pay an extra 100$ for a 50mm lens though, or 200$ for a 40mm, then the 18-55mm lens will suffice. Things to know: If you buy an additional lens separately, know that the 50mm f2.8 lens that canon makes has a very loud autofocus noise whereas the 40mm pancake lens offers very quiet focussing and is MUCH MUCH snappier. If you want to record with the stereo microphone built-in, I would recommend using manual focus. If you videographers out there want to capture video with autofocus on and have clear audio, then an external audio recorder would be a great solution.So, aside from this review (which sounds more like a guide) I'll give a quick run-down of what I think of the camera overall:* - Poor** - Very lacking*** - Average/Indifferent**** - Good***** - PerfectLook/Feel: **** - The camera DOES feel a bit cheap and doesn't have a solid feel to it. However, this is because of the Poly-carbonite exterior which makes the camera very LIGHT. The buttons also feel even cheeper that the T3i which doesn't rustle my feathers much. The camera is also very small but can accommodate a battery grip easily.Battery ** - It needs to be said, the battery life for the common EOS Rebel is very lacking since 440 shots may not be enough for people like me. Movie recording also drains the battery quite rapidly. Since I have a battery grip and two extra batteries, this won't affect my overall review.Performance ***** - I don't feel comfortable giving any category a perfect rating but Canon deserves a pat on the back for making such a friendly camera with an outstanding hybrid sensor, interface, and capabilities. No complaints here.Capabilities/Range ***** - Again a perfect rating, I KNOW. Trying to be fair but I honestly can't think of an accurate reason why this wouldn't deserve 5 stars. The most important differences between the T2i, T3i, and the T4i is that the T4i includes: 9 cross-type autofocus points (which help to capture a clearer image), A hybrid sensor which also accounts for continuous video autofocus, an extended ISO Range, A fabulous touch screen which also swivels, there are also two additional shooting modes which are night-time shooting and HDR, Lastly is the built-in stereo microphone which you may learn to love or not use depending on the lens.Overall *****Since I don't have a pet-peeve about the texture and battery life, I can say with confidence that anyone can take great pictures and video with this camera. It is easy to use, fun to use, and has a huge array of settings to suit more advanced shooters. The price is reasonable too. In conclusion, I love this camera.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my Canon DSLRs", "Author": "PaulMcCarl", "ReviewID": "R1FWRIMV52I8C9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "SO this is my 6th Canon DSLR. I started with the old D30 way back when and have only been pleased with them ever since. I guess I am a loyal fan of the Canon brand. Of course, that might have to do with thousands of dollars worth of lens that I have bought. At any rate, I have been happily shooting my D60 for years (yes, D60, not 60D). I also have two REBEL XT bodies converted for infrared photography. To be honest, super megapixel just hasn't been enough to prompt me to buy anything new. When they added HD video, I almost jumped, but no autofocus while shooting? Kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it.Well, this T4i fixes that. I was still on the fence until I saw some footage on youtube of some drunk guys with no experience trying to shoot a meteor shower by just sticking their new T4i's on tripods and aiming at the sky. Wholly Moley! If  they could get shots like that without any knowledge of what they were doing, I had to have this camera.I love it. I am still learning all of the neat new tricks it has, but it is freaking awesome. It has been a long time since I gave up manual controls in favor of HD video. It is so nice to have both now. I admit it, I shoot more video than stills, but this camera rocks at both. Just buy it.

I've been ready to upgrade for a while and thought to get the T3i, but decided to hold out for this update. I was getting a little frustrated by the limitations of my outdated model, specifically the high noise and low ISO range. The new Digic 5 chip in the T4i is incredible. I am blown away at how better and more accurate this camera is at focusing, metering, and the insanely improved noise reduction. I highly recommend this camera to anyone looking to upgrade, but not ready to make the $2K+ plunge into the 5D realm.I've been using this for a few weeks and here's my take so far:-Much welcomed high ISO range with very good noise control.-The battery life is much improved. I'm kind of shocked, actually. I've taken 2000+ pictures, a few with flash, and several (usually battery-killing) long (10-300 sec) exposures, still on all three bars.-The night scene modes and noise reduction modes are GREAT.-The HDR mode is cool but I've notice the camera isn't as good as software (such as Photomatix) at blending the pictuers, specifically when it comes to ghosting and mainting edge-contrast integrity. This mode is also limited on customizeability of the toning/fusion process as compared to HDR software.-The touch screen and swivel movement are incredible. You can take shots that were otherwise impossible to get, such as the camera being above your head or low to the ground. Focusing on any point with touch is also great.-The video quality is superb, but I'm not really in the video shooting business. It's just fun to have.-I only bought the body, and would recommend this to anyone who can afford to not have the kit lense, despite it's conveneint wide focal range. There are much, much better lenses out there. Even the $100 fixed 50mm is night and day to the kit lens.Overall, I'm smitten with this camera. Canon knocked it out of the park.

My serial number is not on the Canon recall list, so I have to assume that all of the tainted cameras have been sent back by Amazon now and they are issuing nothing but newbies.And, I know it has only been a day, but I am very impressed with this EOS.

I've been using Canon's Rebel XS for the last few years.  That right there is enough for me to rate the T4i as 5 stars.  This has so many improvements compared to my XS such as:  18 megapixels, HD video, writes images to card much faster, 5 fps instead of 3.4.The touch screen is a nice feature.  You can touch the screen and it will focus (a little slow but not bad if you're feeling lazy) and then take a picture.  You can change ISO, aperture, shutter speed and other functions with the touch screen or you can go through all the menus.HD video is nice, I did want a camera that could shoot some video just for fun.  I haven't done much with video yet but it's nice to have whenever taking pictures isn't enough.  I didn't buy the camera just for video or the auto focus as some people mention in their reviews.  Others say the auto focus is bad, I haven't had problems with it (can be slow at times) but I mostly use manual focus.I don't care for the \"artistic\" effects built into the camera (have Photoshop for that) but I love the HDR back lighting feature.Overall, I love this camera.

This was groundbreaking for a lot of people because it meant that with the right lenses, anyone could shoot ultra-high quality video.The trouble was, there was no auto-focus while shooting video.  So, you either pre-focused your camera before going to video mode, or you had to focus by hand.  The trouble for me is that sometimes I like to just put the camera on a tripod and walk into the shot.  This was fine, as long as the subject didn't move.When I heard that the T4i had auto-focus in video, I immediately did some research and there were a lot of people complaining that it was too slow.  While this may be true, the fact is, it does work.  I can move around, and although it may take a few seconds for it to find me, it's far better than having no auto-focus at all.In this video, I don't talk about the new touch screen... but I LOVE IT.  The touch screen was an unexpected bonus that by itself would not be worth upgrading, but it actually makes some tasks quicker.The purpose of my video is to literally focus on the auto-focus.  I'm shooting with a EF-50mm f/1.4 lens, which is not one of the newer STM lenses.  As such, you should be able to hear the lens itself as it focuses.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from T2i", "Author": "Skywise", "ReviewID": "R1BOI60PBWEOLS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned 3 Canon cameras over the years, a Rebel SLR film camera, upgraded to the XTi for digital, then up to the T2i as it added video.  I skipped the T1i/T3i as the feature set didn't seem that much improved over my previous models for the cost.  I've been very happy with the T2i, shooting over 4000 pictures with it.  However, I take a lot of video with the T2i and the stereo mic plus the enhanced Digic 5 processor for better low light performance and an upcoming trip to Vegas (with lots of night shot potential) sold me on upgrading again.  I shot about 500 photos over the past week with it.The T2i wasn't without its quirks.  For example if I was shooting at an obvious target with the center focus point it would consistently try to autofocus somewhere else off to the side if it was closer.  I got around this by just enabling the center AF point but it would still occasionally hunt for the focus.  Another problem I had with it was its occasional color reproduction.  There's a bar at Vegas in the Aria casino called the Moderno Bar with a dark chocolate brown sign and faux trees lit with a blue light that, no matter how I adjusted the exposure or color settings would inevitably turn out as blue gray or sandal wood.  Intense reds or yellows would come out cooler or more intense than my eye was seeing them.  The colors I could fix in post-processing but it was still an annoyance.I'm pleased to report that the T4i is a decent enhancement.Low light performance IS better.  ISO 3200 is useable... SOMETIMES.  It has real problems with gradients (IE dark sunsets, low lighting conditions with shadows will become very noisy and grainy.)  Hard brightness/color changes with solid colors look very good, however.  I suspect that this is due to the built-in noise reduction processing of the camera and not an improvement on the sensor itself.  This noise is NOT noticeable on the built-in screen unless you zoom almost all the way into the picture.  But it's readily noticeable on a regular monitor.  Like the T2i I've set the limit to max out at ISO 1600.  But it IS better than the T2i at ISO 3200.Color reproduction is better - The Moderno Bar came out near perfect on my first shot with the T4i (and a little manual adjusting got it close enough to perfect for my taste for the effect I was going for).  Reds don't tend to \"bloom\" as much either and blend better with the scene.  Auto-Exposure is still tricky, but whereas the T2i guessed too dark and captured a bright picture, the T4i errs on the other side and guesses too light and captures a darker picture.  That's not a killer issue because that's readily apparent from the image review but still a quirk nonetheless.Autofocusing - Much better.  I still only use the center AF point but it was very rare for me to not \"lock\" onto a point to get what I wanted.Stereo Mic - The mic is moved to the top of the camera just in front of the flash hot shoe.  Stereo separation is decent and the mic is much clearer than the T2i's (much more high end)  But... the mic is on the top so its much more sensitive to wind noise.  Even the slightest breeze will sound like a hurricane.  Canon's added a wind noise attenuator that can be enabled which essentially clips the wind noise after half a second.  Overall I'm pleased with the audio.UPDATE - Watch your breathing/camera placement - I was doing some videoing with the camera held at chest level, breathing through my nose and the mic sounded like I was in a hurricane.Autofocusing with video - You don't need the STM lens to get the autofocus feature.  The T4i will automatically step the lens to bring things into focus though it might end up hunting for a bit. This is much better than the T2i's autofocusing abilityu but still not a great solution.  You WILL hear the noise of the lens focusing, even with an ultrasonic motor. (I did not have an STM lens to test with as all the kits in my area that contained them had been recalled for the rubber grip issue and none of my local dealers had the lens itself in stock)  For the T2i I ended up pre-focusing on a far away target then leaving the focus untouched for most cases or manually focusing while videoing and I continued the practice for the T4i.Variable touch screen - Neat feature but I just didn't use the variable portion of the screen.  The touch screen is cool but I found the touch to focus tricky and sensitive to being \"retouched\" before I could press the shutter button.  If you're right handed, you're going to want to touch the screen with your right hand while holding the camera in your left, then grip the right side with your right hand while moving the left to get a brtter steady position and I found myself brushing the screen with my left thumb way too much.  You can also \"swipe\" your pictures and pinch zoom them while viewing them but the buttons still retain the same functionality as before so I continued to just use them.Build quality - The rubber grips (the source of the recall) are actually quite nice, feeling much more flexible and \"grippy\".  The buttons on the back have rough edged plastic that makes them more tactile but also feels a little cheaper.  The button clicking is much more pronounced though and I think that's a good thing.

The focusing and reproduction are somewhat better but I'm not sure it's $900 better if you're not interested in the newer features.

I normally shoot with a Canon 5D with my trusty 24-105 L lens when I am around the house. Between the 5D and the T4i are six years and boy has this little Rebel evolved into an amazing tool.I picked the T4i over the T3i due to the amazing and useful touchscreen, STM lens for silent focusing and IS to shoot video with , and for the new upgraded autofocus. Coming from the very original 5D, I have been very frustrated with focus accuracy. Many times, the focus target would either be front or back focused depending on the lens. And it was NOT user error. Canon was well aware of the issues. I can definitely say that the new STM Kit lens locks on to focus quicker than you can blink and does so in utter silence. It's almost eerie how little your hear at all. I rely on the focus beep to know when I have achieved focus. The lens itself is reasonable sharp for the given wide focal length.I will repeat like many here how useful and smart the touchscreen is when you are reviewing a pic and want to see if the critical parts of your subject are truly in focus. For those who come from smart phones with touchscreens, it's pretty intuitive as to what gesture you need to zoom in and out and to drag the pic around the screen. However, I will concur that the focus by touch feature is pretty useless and slow. I am old school so I always use my optical viewfinder so it's a non issue. AF speed is significantly faster using the viewfinder vs. the touchscreen.Also worth mentioning is that the T4i comes with an external mic input if you want to use your own mic with video. Too bad there is no earphone jacks to monitor audio levels with.In conclusion, I think the T4i is simply terrific. Canon has finally fixed many of the flaws related to AF and lens noise with video shooting. Pictures at high ISO has about the same level of noise as the T3i, which is good. So for those of you sitting on the fence about a Cropped Sensor DSLR form Canon, you have your solution right here. If you have a T3i, then I would advise against upgrading unless you want to shoot videos with the built in stereo mics.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't buy the 18-55mm kit, get the 18-135 STM, trust me!", "Author": "Dennis", "ReviewID": "RDJC6LB08MSG7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When you get this camera, you will see that it takes great photos during the day and in good lighting conditions.

It'll make you wonder why you spent $659 when you're used to your point-and-shoot cameras making beautiful no-noise videos for under $200.  However, that's not what this camera is for, and if you want to shoot video with quiet autofocus, don't make my mistake... pay the extra $200 now for the 18-135mm STM kit.  it has the exact same capabilities as the 18-55, except you'll love how far it can zoom in, and the autofocus will be silent and you will enjoy wonderful 1080P videos.

Even if you have no intention of shooting video with the camera, the 18-135 lens is much more versatile and will focus faster while taking photos.Later on, I recommend buying a prime lens that is faster with a smaller f-stop so that you can capture great low-light photos without using flash, at night and at indoor events.  I bought the Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras.

If you are buying this Camera mainly for still photography, then stop reading these reviews and go buy it now. It is simply the best. The auto-focus works perfectly. Even photos taken with the pre-configured settings on the camera are perfect. You hardly need to do manual settings for iso, white balance etc because the camera gets them right out of the box for most situations.If you are buying this camera mainly for video, then you better start learning how to use manual focus. The Autofocus for video is not good. A lot of mechanical noise (with the 18-55mm lens) gets recorded, a lot of jittering and focus hunting. Even when you set it to Autofocus with the AF Servo and Flexizone Single mode to continuously focus on a moving subject, it tracks for a moment and still does a lot of focus hunting.The autofocus for video is slow. Takes up to 4 seconds to focus at times, and the focus hunting will definitely ruin your shots.Bottom line. For still photography, it is the best, you don't need to change a thing. For video, make sure you learn how to focus manually.Everything else is perfect, the touchscreen, stereo mic, battery and recording time which is up to 29 minutes.", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Paired with new Canon 40 mm EF STM Lens, a Real Winner", "Author": "KCinDC76", "ReviewID": "R3I8MWMHZ3T0SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ii like to carry my camera with me wherever I go, and not have to keep it in a separate bag, but the lenses in my collection don't make that very practical.  The Canon EOS T4i is a great camera, as many other reviewers have said, and the purpose of my review isn't to repeat those comments. Instead, I want to comment on the T4i with a 40mm lens, which is also new from Canon.Paired with the new Canon 40mm EF f/2.8 STM Lens the T4i is my ideal camera.  With the 40mm lens, the camera suddenly becomes compact. Assuming you don't have any add-ons attached to the body, such as the Photive PH-BGE8 Battery Grip for Canon EOS Rebel T4i, T3i, T2i (Replaces Canon BG-E8), all you really have to carry around is the body itself since the lens is so slim.The 40mm lens is very quiet - almost silent - making videos taken on the EOS T4i top notch.  At first I thought I would miss being able to zoom while taking videos, but its nice actually not to have to worry about that.  Quiet, of course, is relative.  You can barely hear it as it focuses.  And, compared to my Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS  Standard Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras it is extremely quiet.Finally - and I can't explain this - having a small lens seems to make subjects more relaxed, even disarm them.

On my long list was the Canon T4i and wanted to purchase it the very first day it went on sale. Luckily for me, I decided to hold-off the spending splurge and wait to see if now comers would hit the market right after Canon debuted their T4i.At one point I had considered the Sony NEX 5, since I didn't want to seem like the typical tourist with a bulky camera. A friend of mine has the Sony NEX 5 and I have to say, while small and sleek, it does not provide the quality I am searching for, especially when planning to fork over about $1K for a camera. Need not to say you don't get what you pay for, but I want an item to exceed what I am paying for, and that is exactly what I received.I ordered my camera on September 12 and received it on the 14th. I felt like a kid on Christmas when the UPS truck arrived with my package; all the shiny boxes and accessories made me feel special. When I looked at the box, I am amazed and astonished to see where my money had gone....slightly opening the bright colored Canon T4i box, it unveiled the product I had purchased.Now, moving forward, at first I didn't know how to use the manual modes or other features, but after a few tutorials on YouTube and reading the manual, I finally figured how to capture some astonishing shots and how to utilize the AF feature properly to focus on the subject(s).If this is your fist SLR, the first set of pictures may not seem up to par on what you may expect, but give it a day or so, and you will realize how to use the features and get amazing results. I cannot praise this camera enough. Having owned may Canon's I wanted to stick with a brand I could trust and that is exactly what I got.My friend who has a Nikon and the Sony NEX is amazing at the quality it shoots. I would say, give yourself a moment, read the manual and a youtube tutorial and you'll feel like your shoot like a pro.This camera has engaged so much, I may take up a photography course to learn more and get acquainted with the lenses on the market.As a pointer- I also bought the Canon 50mm F1.8 lens for head-shots and portraits and love the results. it focuses automatically on the subject and the results are great. I was going to get the more expensive lens at F1.4 but want to settle on this cheaper lens since it was my first time having an SLR camera.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "RANCU2IFXNC4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fast, compact stills camera with a touchscreen that simplifies configuration, image review, and the EOS learning curve. There are better movie cameras. Motion tracking for video, while a vast improvement over Canon DSLRs before this one, falls short of many mirrorless bodies.Buy it over mirrorless systems and the T2i/T3i if you want faster shooting and tracking with stills. Choose the SL1 for the most petite size, the 60D for a quicker interface and a deeper buffer for raw files, or the 7D for even better motion-tracking. Image quality is the same between all the crop bodies. Low-light performance improves with the full-frame 6D and above.Because this body is almost identical to the T5i, I've written very similar reviews for both bodies.

I prefer the larger grips of the 60D and above. There's not much practical difference in portability; the T5i, like the 60D, is too large for a pocket or most purses. It is lighter by a quarter, but if you're really sweating the ounces, a mirrorless system or the SL1 is a better choice.Certain adjustments are less accessible than with the 60D and 7D. For lack of a thumb wheel, this Rebel and the others require more buttons held in combination to activate basic functions like exposure compensation. There's no top LCD, so a quick check of your settings or changing the white balance requires booting the rear screen. Likewise, there's no joystick or 8-way pad for direct AF point selection. The higher-tier cameras make it easier to rapidly correct settings without taking your eye from the viewfinder and missing the subject or the moment.The counterpoint is that showing everything on the rear screen with touch control significantly lowers the EOS learning curve. The touchscreen is capacitive and almost as responsive as a modern smartphone. Adjusting functions (e.g., exposure, white balance, focus points; everything) is as simple as tapping what you want. The camera won't be at the ready when you're manipulating the LCD, but thanks in part to an integrated 'feature guide' that explains most options, you probably won't need to pull out the manual on first acquaintance.Phone gestures (e.g., pinch zoom, swiping) are now part of the picture review system, which makes checking focus vastly quicker and more flexible than on any other non-touch EOS body. Focus itself is touch-enabled in Live View mode, so you can tap to focus on static subjects anywhere in the frame without ever having to manipulate the 9-point AF system.There's no weather-sealing in the body or the kit lenses. Don't use either in the rain without a cover. You do get a popup flash, though for lack of direct diffusion or bounce, using it as a main light will lead to harsh, high-contrast results. The rear LCD swivels to the side almost parallel to the body and rotates a full 360 degrees, so you can easily frame self-portraits, or turn it in to face the body for protection in storage.STILLS QUALITY:This sensor is functionally identical to those in the T2i/T3i/T5i/60D/7D/SL1. Noise and dynamic range are the same in raw, though noise in JPEG is a tick cleaner with the T4i and T5i. Expect acceptable results up to ISO 3200. Nikon's D5100 is slightly better, Sony's A65 slightly worse. It's about two solid stops better than a typical point-and-shoot.Unless you're in a JPEG-only shooting mode (e.g., multi-shot NR, HDR), raw gets the most out of this camera. Post-production creates the bulk of the appeal of many photographs (e.g., Instagram) and JPEG often lacks the requisite flexibility. Raw shooting also lets you defer decisions (e.g., white balance, sharpening, noise reduction, color, distortion, tone curves, and even exposure) that distract from catching whatever moment you're after.HDR combines 3 shots taken in rapid succession. The automated result preserves highlights in a subtle, natural way, but not with greatly more range than a raw file with Highlight Tone Priority enabled. If you want to do your own processing with a program like SNS-HDR, you'll be adjusting exposures manually because Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) is limited to 3 shots from -2EV to +2EV.Multi-Shot NR combines 4 shots to create one with less noise. You can set your own starting ISO, but the effects aren't apparent until ISO 800. At high ISO, it's good for about 1.5 stops. If the camera's already on a tripod or you can lean on an IS lens, you might as well lower the ISO and shoot for longer. A limited auto-alignment feature applies to handheld sequences for this feature and the similar 'Handheld Night Scene' shooting mode.STILLS ACTION:This camera has the same phase-detect AF unit (9 points, all cross-type) and nearly the same framerate (5 fps vs. 5.3 fps) as the 60D. That bodes well for capturing motion. What doesn't is the raw buffer. If you hold the shutter down in continuous mode, it'll take 6 raw, 4 raw + JPEG, or up to 30 JPEGs before slowing down. That's barely a second of continuous raw shooting, much less than with the 60D's 16 raw frames. The difference matters if you're trying to time a particular moment. That aside, this T5i has a reasonably high hit-rate (50%+) with recent USM lenses in moderate to bright conditions. The next performance tier is the 7D, and after that, the 5D III.I want to point out: DSLRs suffer when shooting stills from the rear screen. Standard SLR design has a mirror and a prism (or additional mirrors) reflect incoming light into both the viewfinder and the fast phase-detect AF array. If you want a live feed to the rear screen, that mirror has to flip up to expose the sensor, so you can't use that array to focus anymore. You're left with a 'contrast detect' system (or in this particular body, a slightly faster amalgam of contrast and phase-detect) that's much, much slower. Expect to use the viewfinder unless your subject is very still.VIDEO:T4i video is smoother, cleaner, and less contrasty than that of point-and-shoot cameras. As with stills, the right lenses can give you creamy backgrounds and professional-looking subject isolation. The corollary, though, is that focus actually matters. Your first impression reviewing footage is likely to be, \"Why is everything always so blurry?\"Fortunately, autofocus in video mode was a major upgrade in the T4i. Canon DSLRs before this one had horribly slow contrast-detect AF that couldn't handle any subject motion at all. Canon's never bothered with manual focusing aids, so custom firmware or trial-and-error with the rear LCD were the only alternatives. Thanks to 'Hybrid AF,' this camera is not totally inept with movement. It doesn't work quickly or precisely with non-STM lenses, it tends to hunt (bringing the scene in and out of focus) with all lenses, it doesn't work well outside of the frame center (where it's assisted by phase-detect sensors) or in low light, and it's incapable of tracking anything faster than a caffeinated sloth. But it's not manual focus. And that's worth something.Realistically, if you want to film your kid playing soccer or running across the kitchen with DSLR quality, you've three options: prefocus, stop the lens down to get more depth-of-field, and try to stay perpendicular to the action; manually focus and accept that things won't be pin-sharp; or choose a mirrorless camera that can keep up.Canon video is MOV format with H.264 compression. The implementation is inefficient and processing-intensive. You'll want a serious computer (quad-core), lots of space (350 MB/min at 1080p/30), and a decent video editor (e.g., Apple iMovie, Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere Elements). Results improve with correct white balance and a custom tone curve with low contrast, color, and sharpening.Beware camera shake. Anything over 50mm that isn't stabilized will challenge your ability to record smooth footage. You can fix that later by transcoding to an editable format and using the anti-shake facilities of Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas, or Virtual Dub with Deshaker, but that's a pain and they all crop the frame. This won't be issue until you start moving to primes; the two kit lenses are both stabilized. They're also STM, which means they focus by stepper motors that are quieter and capable of smaller incremental movements than USM.Certain full-frame stabilized lenses are audible on the audio track, as are the focusing mechanisms of non-STM lenses. You'll also have to contend with dial clicks, finger movement, and wind noise, which obscure what would be fairly mediocre sound quality in the best case. The T5i records CD-quality 48 KHz 16-bit stereo tracks; the fault is with the lack of isolation and baffling with the integrated stereo mic. The simplest, most portable alternative is to attach an external battery-powered mic in a shock mount to the flash hotshoe. The two most popular are around $250 from Rode. Zoom's H1 stereo recorder costs less and can also be camera-mounted.LENSES:The 18-135/3.5-5.6 STM excels; it's likely the best consumer-class kit lens Canon has ever produced. If you upgrade, it'll be for more speed, a different range, or perhaps more contrast, not because it isn't sharp enough. The 18-55/3.5-5.6 IS II is fine for stills, but the STM version that appears in the T5i kit is preferable for movie use. I'd spring for the 18-135; the only benefit of the 18-55 is that it's a bit smaller and lighter.Some thoughts on future additions:* Primes are lighter, smaller, cheaper, often available in wider apertures, often optically better, and have less manufacturing variation. They're less convenient, less versatile, updated with new technologies (e.g., stabilization, better lens coatings, weight reductions, faster or more accurate AF) less often, and can cause you to miss shots in fast-paced shooting environments.* There are different requirements for movie lenses and still lenses. Some lenses are more optimal than others (e.g., less focus breathing, more parfocal, less distortion, smoother operation, distance scale). Primes often fare better.* An f/2 lens on this body is just fast enough for most indoor use without flash. You'll want a flash for anything slower. A flash can provide more even, pleasing pictures, at the expense of a bulkier, attention-attracting rig.* Kits with more than three primary lenses can become unwieldy in use. Two is preferable. My walkaround crop kit is a 10-22/3.5-4.5, a 50/1.4, and an 18-135-3.5-5.6 STM.* Third-party lenses tend to have less upfront cost, better warranties, and more aggressive designs. AF and optical performance is often (but not always) inferior to OEM lenses, quality control is less consistent, and resale values are lower. Value varies by lens model. Some are better than the OEM equivalents (e.g., Tamron 70-300 VC). Some fill holes in the OEM lineup (e.g., Sigma 50-150/2.8 OS, Sigma 30/1.4). And some are lesser substitutes, but still competitive (e.g., Sigma 10-20/4-5.6). Third-party lenses that duplicate the OEM with similar performance may not always be preferable to used copies of the OEM model.The most economical leap in image quality and subject isolation is the 50/1.8. But beware: this lens will lighten your pockets when you start seeking other lenses with the same effect.ACCESSORIES:For video, buy SD cards 32 GB or larger. My pair of 16 GB cards have been inadequate for even a one-day event. For stills, two or three 8 GB cards is plenty.Interface responsiveness isn't much affected by card speed. Faster cards have three advantages: they can shoot longer bursts at 5 FPS, clear the picture buffer more quickly, and record video at the highest quality without risking a speed warning. Buffer depth is 30 JPEG files with a UHS-1 ('Ultra High Speed') SD and 22 with a conventional card, or 6 raw with any card. Buffer cycling times are much lower with UHS-1. In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.If you buy protection filters for your lenses, try Hoya's \"DMC PRO1 Clear Protector Digital\" line. They have very high light transmission and cause no visible flare. Digital sensors filter UV natively, there's no reason to pay more for that feature. I've written reviews on the relevant Hoya product pages with more details and why you might (or might not) want a filter.COMPARED:VS. T3i:You gain continuous shooting speed, better AF for stills, and a touchscreen. The AF system will be faster and more accurate with wide-aperture lenses, particularly with off-center subjects. The hybrid-AF system is actually usable in slow video scenes, more than could be said for contrast-detect functionality in the T2i and T3i.VS. T5i:The T5i is the same camera save for a new ability to preview effects in Live View, but the 18-55 kit lens has STM. The 18-135 is the same; if the T4i with the 18-135 costs less, I'd choose that.VS. 60D:Of the 60D's many improvements, the hardest to work around is the raw buffer. You get one second at 5fps with the T4i. You get over three with the 60D. The T4i simply isn't a sports camera in raw unless you're judicious with your bursts. Shoot JPEG and it'll keep the pace all day. And shoot movies where anything moves at all and it'll leave the 60D behind in focusing performance.Interface speed significantly favors the 60D if you're willing to learn the button assignments. Because it requires less button-pressing and the camera rarely needs to come off your face, it's faster than the T4i except for detailed picture review and choosing focus areas in Live View. The 60D actually costs the same new, but don't choose the 18-135 kit. That's a non-STM lens much less sharp than the version the T4i includes.IN SUM:I'm of two minds about this T4i. On the one hand, it's another fine evolution of small DSLRs. On the other, the question is whether you want a DSLR at all. Price aside, most people would fare better with mirrorless (e.g., Sony NEX or Panasonic G/GH) than a Rebel-class DSLR. They're smaller, lighter, and less clunky than the strange amalgam of 'Live View' and traditional mirror shooting that defines most current DSLRs. Focus is unerringly accurate with static subjects and vastly quicker in the movie modes. To their credit, DSLRs like this one have a broader array of narrow-purpose lenses (e.g., macro, tilt-shift, supertelephoto, superfast), far better motion tracking for stills, more subject isolation, faster and better physical controls, and if you spring for full-frame, superior noise performance.If your priorities favor DSLRs, this isn't a bad one to choose. There's almost no photographic endeavor it can't handle. Higher-spec bodies get you better noise, speed, AF tracking, durability, and so on, but technology has advanced so quickly that if you're even vaguely methodical in shooting style, you're not likely to feel limited by this T4i. Look hard at the 60D before springing for it, though.Please leave a comment if you intend to downvote.

I have taken it on several vacations. I must say that as a first-time DSLR buyer there is a lot here for the price.First things first: get it with the 18-135mm. It is a do-all lens. Spent a week in NYC with only this lens and it worked flawlessly. Also, if you are looking to buy this camera and intend to keep it in automatic, just do yourself a favor and get a Sony NEX-series or an even more simple point and shoot. The joy of a DSLR is in the usage of its capabilities. Save yourself money (though that depends), weight and size if you intend on just leaving it in green.The camera is build solidly. It is plastic, but that shouldn't take away from its construction. It feels excellent in the hand. It is not a full-frame, like its 5D counterpart, so the size is smaller. Having used both, with larger than average hands, both are easy to hold.18MP is more than enough for ANYONE who wants to take great pictures. Images are detailed and, depending on the lens, crisp. The AF system is a dramatic change from the previous generations. I used a T2i for several months before buying this to familiarize myself with DSLRs and the T4i's autofocus is fast and accurate. Remember that it is a cropped sensor so multiply all focal lengths by 1.6 to get the real lengthThe shinning star of the camera is the touchscreen. It functions exactly like an iPhone. It is smooth, responsive, and extremely useful. I expect the next generations of all Canon's consumer and prosumer range to get this screen. Colors are vibrant as well. Changing settings is now very simple with the screen. Its so fast I tend to leave it in full manual most of the time.Cons: I've done a fair amount of night photography. Its ISO performance is not what I would call amazing. Its not bad, and at 1600 and under, easily correctable in post. I've also been shooting star trails with exposures longer than 20 minutes. If you have a particular setting activated to help reduce noise, processing time is 1:1 on exposure time (read that as a 20 minutes exposure takes another 20 minutes to process). With that off it functions normally, but gets very noisy.In the end I am very pleased. It is a solid choice for a DSLR. This Rebel is so good that Kai from DigitalRevTV agrees that there is a lot here to not call it a prosumer camera. If it were made out of magnesium Canon would be charging a lot for this.UPDATEAfter about ten months with this camera I have some updates. Battery performance is stellar. I simply do not turn my camera off because it powers down automatically. It spends weeks just \"on.\" I maintain my issue with this camera's lowlight performance. Even with excellent glass like a Canon 50 f/1.2L, it just is not what I want. When using an ISO over 1600, I find the images too noisy, and hard to deal with in post. Because of this I am moving on to a 6D in the near future, simply because the full-frame sensor will function better in the situations I prefer to take photos in. Make no mistake though, this is a quality consumer camera. It is a joy to use and very capable.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good upgrade from T1i to T4i", "Author": "D.

Yes, you can push into higher ISO on T4i then T1i but kind of useless (> 1600 ISO) due to the unacceptable noise.  Maybe it need a firmware upgrade which I did on my T1i (made some difference).  I also noticed the buttons feedback are not as solid as the T1i...maybe is just me.Filming with STM lens is great so I order the 40mm STM the following day after play with the T4i.  The 18-135mm kit lens is way to go if you want to shoot video.  I have 3 lens from my T1i, 18-55mm kit, 18-200mm travel and 10-22mm super wide angle so 18-55mm+55-300mm is not my choice of lens (not STM too).  After compared the 18-200mm to this new 18-135mm STM, the quality of 18-135mm STM (Made in Taiwan) is on part with 10-22mm (Made in Jpn) and way better than 18-200mm in sharpness.I do wish it has build-in wifi and gps...", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC CAMERA", "Author": "anniez", "ReviewID": "R2DS60L55VXB8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Sony person for a long time.

Nunes \"Chrissy\"", "ReviewID": "R23EL38CS0LE2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an amateur / hobbyist photographer for a fair few years now and plunged into DSLR photography back in January 2008 when I bought a used Canon 30D but it has never really been \"right\".  There have always been issues with the colour management and thus, my photos usually needed tweaking in post editing software so I have been needing to upgrade for quite some time now.It was a really tough decision for me;  do I keep on the \"D\" series line and buy the latest 60D, which is the natural progression from my old 30D or, do I buy from the \"T\" line, which in theory, is below the \"D\" series?Confusing for me as I am not an over technical person so I went to a local store and asked to look at both the 60D and the T4i.  I wanted to get a \"feel\" for them both because I liked the weighty feel of my old camera and wasn't sure if I could \"step backwards\" to the lighter Rebel range cameras.  In fairness, with my 18 - 200mm Sigma lens attached, I can't tell much difference!In the end, what really swayed it for me was the upgraded image sensor, the new DIGIC 5, something which the 60D doesn't have and knowing that my images are going to come out far sharper, clearer and with better colour than the older DIGIC 4.I have not been disappointed with my purchase at all so far and although I haven't put it to great use yet, having only had it for one week, but I have played around with some of the newer features like the hand held night scene where it shoots four consecutive shots and then the camera merges them together to reduce noise and shake.... this seems to work really well and I can imagine it will be a great feature for indoor shots where a flash isn't suitable or for a quick outdoor night shot where setting up on a tripod etc would be too timely.  I went out with the camera for the first time yesterday to try out its functionality and although I'm no pro photographer, I am fairly experienced with cameras but I normally shoot in shutter priority, never daring to go to full manual mode but refusing to let the camera make all of the decisions for me in full auto mode..... I loved playing around with this camera, it was so user friendly and I found myself quickly switching the dial to M and shooting in fully manual!I haven't really used the new touch screen feature for changing settings etc yet but I have used it for flicking through my shots in review mode, this makes it much faster than the old way of using the dial and left/right buttons however; I'm not a big touch screen fan, on any device as I hate all the finer marks left behind, but that's just my own personal peeve and one which may not bother others?In a nutshell (I'll leave the real technical reviews to those more technically minded than I) I would highly recommend the Canon T4i as an upgrade from your previous T2i/T3/T3i or even your 30D - 60D..... the new Digic 5 image processor is well worth making the purchase on its own, without all the other added features that this camera has.  You will instantly see the difference in your images, even when shooting at a much higher ISO and I would imagine that even when it comes to printing, an image shot at 3200 / 6400 ISO would still make for a fantastic print to hang on any wall!!I certainly don't feel like I have made a step backwards from the \"D\" series by purchasing this nifty little Rebel and I think you will be as pleased with it as I am.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Get the STM lens if you use Video", "Author": "J.

The fun . . . and the challenge . . . is to play with aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.  But, learning how to do so is, simultaneously, a challenge, a process, and where the fun and results are.The camera gives you several ways to do virtually anything -- and that can get confusing.  Where do I find this?  What is the point of my doing this or that?  How do I find out?My first and best suggestion is an excellent course from the Great Courses ([...]) called \"Fundamentals of Photography\" by National Geographic photograpgher Joel Santore. It is NOT a course in the Canon Rebel T4i, but it IS a course that will explain aperture, shutter speed, depth of field, composition, and a lot about digital cameras.  Whatever he covers is doable with the Rebel T4i.  And, he'll have you WANTING to do it.  The only question is, \"How?\"  The course is frequently on sale and should be bought only when it is on sale since the \"regular\" price is considerably higher and unnecessary.  On sale, the course goes for around $60.That's where the second reference comes in, Canon EOS Rebel T4i/650D For Dummies by Julie Adair King.  You can get it for about $16 from Amazon.Sartore's course will provide knowledge, motivation, and a clear idea of what you might try.  The King book will help you fill in the gaps on how, specifically, do you do it with the Canon.Some random notes:o  Sartore's course is, IMHO, the best by far of the Great Course offerings (although some of the music courses by Robert Greenberg are pretty good).  He gives \"homework\" assignments to help develop you as a photographer.  They're worth actually doing!o  Those whose prior experience with lower-priced digital cameras had them disappointed because of the slow focusing and shooting speeds, can rest easy.  This camera focuses quickly and its burst speed is remarkable, allowing you to take a barrage of pictures in very rapid order.  Those people who you find attractive but not photogenic will now take a good picture because, by taking several pictures rapidly, you'll catch those micro expressions which account for their attractiveness.  (Everyone is as photogenic if you take enough pictures of them.  And, since there is no cost to taking lots of pictures, why not?)o  Aperture, the size of the opening through which a picture is taken, determines the depth of field (i.e., whether the background is clear or not).  Learn to use it to take pictures that blur the background when the subject is more important and to provide 3-D effects.  (The more the background is blurred, the more the subject seems to leap off the page ... or canvas if you have the picture printed out on canvas and blown up.)o  Shutter speed -- the faster the shutter speed, the more an action is frozen rather than blurred.  At the higher speeds, a moving fan will appear to be a picture of a stopped fan or a kicked football will appear frozen in the air.  At the lower speeds, more light is admitted and a tripod may be necessary.o  ISO speed.  With modern cameras, one can shoot at night without a flash if the ISO speed is set high enough.  The downside?  The shots may appear grainier.And there is the photographer's trio -- smaller apertures and faster shutter speeds, which are sometimes desired, admit less light.  So, one has to decide whether to use a flash or a higher ISO (film or memory sensitivity to light).  Or, if one doesn't use fully manual mode, one can pick a setting that allows you to take control of any one of the Big 3 and allow the camera to take care of the other 2 -- which is, in fact, what I usually opt to do.==================================================================The camera is highly capable and flexible.  Go with a high speed, high capacity memory card to avoid handcuffing it.  Then, get out of automatic mode and explore it.NOTE:  I know.  I know.  This review is useless for those who know photography and cameras well.  But, you're not my audience. I'm writing for those who want to take the next step to assist in their finding an approach to learning more about this camera.I haven't said a lot about the camera itself, per se, other than that it's capable and flexible.

I'm just telling the other tyros who are considering stepping up that the water is fine and where to get their swimming lessons.I feared that I had bought too much camera but have been glad to find that the camera is like Excel.  You can use it immediately and get some fine results.  But, when ready, you can use it at far deeper levels and will find that whatever you want to do with it you can do with it . . . if you dig a little deeper to learn more of its capabilities.

I cut my teeth on the canon xti that I got as a handy down camera and felt that I get everything I could get out of it, so it was time for an upgrade.I chose this camera because its effectively a D60 with a lower price, smaller body and newer processor with a bunch of new added features.You get all the performance that you would expect from canons higher end camera but in a smaller form factor and lower price.  Also the touch screen is fantastic for quickly switching camera functions and Id take the touch screen over multiple dials and a top lcd plate any day.  The inclusion of the movie mode right on the on/off switch seems like a small feature but it gives you so much more flexibility as you can now shoot video in full manual and no longer requires you to spin the mode dial half way across the planet just to shoot a video.  The photo quality is really quite excellent and Im blown away at the amount of detail preserved in the shots.  Also one other really quite cool feature is that you can use the internal flash as a trigger for a external flash gun, something to keep in mind if you already own a flash with a slave function.All that being said the camera does have some draw backs.  The image quality is amazing but its no better than the t2i and t3i, so if you already own one of those cameras then their really is no point in upgrading.  Also unless you have one of their new stm lenses the autofocus in live mode is really quite abysmal and not at all usable for video recording, be prepared for a lot of manual focusing.  Which leads me to my next point, the view finder is quite dim and not really well suited for manual focus but that is alleviated somewhat by the zoom function in live view.All my complaints though are quite nit picky and really wont affect your shooting on a day to day basis.

I upgraded from a Canon 40D and I expected to like the newer functions and being able to shoot video. I did not expect to be blown away, just glad to have some new features. Within about a minute of turning the camera and playing around with it I was actually blown away by the ease of shooting and the clarity of the handheld shots in low lighting. With the 18-135 STM lens, I didn't expect great low light ability because it isn't a fast 2.8 lens. To test it I took some photos of fish in my aquarium with the tank lights off and only one light on the other side of the room. I couldn't believe how well they turned out. The image stabilization worked very well and the image was sharp for a handheld shot as I expected. What really got me was the color it captured. It was catching the colors I feel like I see in the full light. I couldn't even see the color very well at all with my eyes, but the camera was working it's magic and pulling them out - faithful to the actual color of the fish and corals. I didn't expect that at all. I actually said \"WOW!\" when I saw the first image. I took multiple shots zoomed in and they all looked great. I tried out the flash and think there is a little more height of this pop up flash compared to the one on the 40D. I was taking pictures of the fish behind the glass of the aquarium and I was getting great lighting without a big bright flash showing up in the picture. Whatever the combination of zoom, flash height, flash coverage, whatever, it really gave me great results.I didn't expect to be able to have a shallow depth of field with this lens, but I could zoom in and focus on the keys on my keyboard and have items 4 inches behind it blurry with a booka like effect. The focus was very defined where I wanted it.The touch screen works beautifully for me. I really like the ability to have the live view mode up when shooting, have the angle I want to shoot at without having to crank my neck around to see in the viewfinder, view playback on it and pinch to zoom just like on an iPhone, and touch the area I want the camera to focus on. The picture is so much clearer on this display than it was on the screen of the 40D.I've only spent about 30 minutes with this camera and lens combo and I know I will love it. I actually decided to quit playing around with it and write this review because I was so happy with it and wanted to recommend it to others.If you are thinking about getting the body only, I highly recommend getting the 18-135 STM lens.

I've used the entry level Sonys and Nikons and feel that although they may get better reviews than the Canons on certain Websites, I have Canon lenses and flashes and the Canon Rebels offer a perfect balance of ergonomics, control and image quality. Canon is a lot like GE - they may not be best in class in everything but you're going to be hard pressed to find a market that GE is outside the top 3. Canon does everything on their cameras very good to excellent (e.g. build, reliability, features, image quality, etc.) - when you do that across the board, you get an outstanding product. One thing I love about the T4i (and previous Rebels) is that you get direct button access to the most common settings (e.g. ISO, white balance, focus area). I can't believe how many cameras (even the more advanced Canon 60D) bury some of these settings in the menus. Additionally, the new T4i touch screen is cool and well implemented (although totally unnecessary). One other cool new feature is the T4i recognizes the lens you are using and corrects two lens aberrations automatically (peripheral and chromatic). I know you can do that yourself in post-production and I'm not even sure how effective it is but I assume it's doing some good!The T4i does everything extremely well except for the following:Live view (i.e. using the viewfinder to shoot) - this is terrible - it takes forever to focus, especially indoors. However, I rarely ever use live view - the only time I would ever use live view instead of the viewfinder is when I want a creative angle (e.g. holding the camera above my head or putting it on the ground). This represents about 1 of every 500 photos I take. Similarly, as others mentioned, the focusing during video is loud. You can \"fix\" this by buying a lens tailored toward video or by focusing on something before starting your video and then deactivating the servo autofocus. Of course you will only focus on what you originally focused on before recording the video. Obviously this only works if you film something that remains in one focus plane. And you remove the much heralded option of focusing on one thing and then switching focus to another thing mid-video.The new handheld night scene and HDR backlight scenes are awesome, but when you move to those modes on the dial you are forced to shoot in green box (i.e. automatic) mode. For those shooters experienced enough to recognize when they need to activate those two new modes it is disappointing to be forced into automatic mode - auto ISO, auto focusing point, auto WB. Additionally, Canon put these two new modes on the opposite side of the dial as the M and AV modes. I shoot in M and AV virtually 100% of the time - the exception is when I want to shoot the new HDR or handheld night modes. Those two new modes are about 12 clicks away from M and AV on the dial - not only is it annoying and time consuming to move the 12 clicks to the new modes, but I'm sure I'm putting wear and tear on the dial. Either Canon didn't expect people to use these modes as often as others (e.g. macro, sports, landscape) or the Rebel user base primarily shoots in the pre-set modes, making the M and AV shooters like me the minority.Lastly, I think I read that when you shoot Auto ISO (something I don't do) and use flash, the ISO won't drop below 400. For those who know a little about photography, this means it will be very hard for use to use fill-flash outdoors - if you're outside shooting ISO 400, most of the time you will be above 1/250.As you can see, my criticisms of the camera (mentioned above) are for very minor items.

If I hadn't fallen, I would not have updated. The T4i sensor is at best a minor upgrade from the sensor used in all the Txi line (including my T1i). It has slightly more MPs than my T1i (18 vs 15+) so the increase in resolution doesn't justify an upgrade. Dynamic range and noise control as rated by DX0 are also basically the same for the entire Txi line. (Note that I do see improved noise handing with the T4i compared to the T1i ISO 1600 is useful especially with Lightroom 4) This means that the upgrade from the T1i to the T4i does not provide improved image quality for still photographs. So if you own an early Canon Rebel Txi you will get more image quality improvement by investing in a new lens than by investing in a new camera.That being said the T4i does provide improvements in handling and for movies. The articulated LCD is a joy to use. It's something that you have to use to appreciate and wonder how you got along without it.Auto focus is quicker and seems to be more accurate in many situations. With my T1i the auto focus would often hunt for focus--I don't see this with the T4i.For those interested in video the big advance is continuous auto focus when in video mode. This usually works quite well. However, there are times when the auto focus tries to make small adjustments and the focus changes slightly. Also the auto focus sometimes is slow to react when in video mode. The big draw back to continuous focus is that the mike picks up the noise of the focus motor. For my use this is no big deal because I replace the in camera sound track. Canon's new lenses for this camera a supposed to be overcome this issue.If you're thinking that this camera provides a single camera solution to your desire for video and stills you need to carefully consider your needs. It's a very good serious still camera. And if used properly it's also a very good serious video camera. But if you're looking for a video camera to take video of your kids soccer games and general family video, you might be better off with a video camcorder. The T4i is heavier than a camcorder--especially with a moderate to long zoom lens. You don't have power zoom, so you won't be able to zoom in on your kid when he scores the wining goal with the same ease that you can with power zoom. But if you want shallow depth of field effects and other pro video effects, then the T4i will produce for you.In summary, this is a very good DSLR at a good price. The image quality is excellent and can produce at least 16x20\" prints (Biggest that my printer can provide.) I love the way the camera handles it's better than by older T1i. I like the video and find that I use it more often than I thought. But I still use my camcorder most of the time for video.If you've invested in Canon and have a small to large collection of high quality Canon lenses, then you should look at this to see if the improved video and handling justify the investment in a new body. If you're looking at investing in your first DSLR you should consider the T4i, but you should also look an the Nikon and Sony offerings. Nikon and Sony offer cameras with higher resolution and better dynamic range and noise handling. The video capabilities of the T4i are superior to the video capabilities of similar Nikon and Sony cameras. So consider you needs carefully and then review all the cameras offered.

Canon comes out with models rather frequently and it can be confusing to know which one to choose. This camera does a lot and is full of features, but there is a reason not to buy it and either stick with the T3i or go to a T5i.I'm coming right out and saying, I don't recommend the T4i. There are reports, confirmed by Canon that something in the rubberized plastic coating that covers the body gave some people a skin reaction. Apparently it is zinc. Do you have a metal allergy? A lot of people do. The grips got discolored in a short time and people reported getting an allergic reaction to the grips. I had to dig to find this, but it may be the reason the T5i, which has almost the same features, came out six months after the T4i. The T5i has a new coating that does not have this issue. There are a few improved features, but it's not a major change from the T4i.

Instead of having to use a loupe, play with the arrows, or pray that you got everything in focus, now you can simply pinch to zoom exactly where you want to see if focus was locked.  Browsing photos is also more natural with the touchscreen, and you can touch to focus using the camera's liveview.Second, it supports video autofocus with especially good performance on the screw-type STM lenses such as the EF-S 18-135mm.  This type of lens is relatively quick in keeping focus unlike the micro motor and micro USM motors, even performing better than Ring USM for video (although Ring USM outperforms Screw-type STM for photos).  Note that the 40mm pancake uses a motor-based STM which is not as zippy as the screw-type STM in the 18-135mm.Third, it supports Chromatic Aberration correction in camera which is a bonus as it reduces post-processing time.Overall, this camera is a fantastic first camera.  However, if you are serious about getting in photography you might want to spend a little more and get the EOS 70D.  While the T4i is great, the sensor is not as good as the 70D and it is missing a lot of features compared to the 70D. Then again, it is going to cost you a decent amount more for the 70D so if your budget is straining with the T4i, don't hesitate in pulling the trigger as this camera is solid!

I've owned several 35mm cameras, other cameras, digitals, camcorders.  I've shot silly photos of family members, landscapes and buildings, and gorgeous sexy models.  I'm not a biased \"cheerleader\" for one brand:  I've owned Minolta, Pentax, Leica, and Canon.  I've shot about 7,000 photos with this particular camera so far.About this seller:  Awesome.  Fast.  Good price.  No BS'ing.  You click your mouse, and a few days later you get exactly what you wanted in the mail.Camera Pros:  This camera hits the \"sweet spot\" for features and price.  Silent lens (STM lens!) with stabilization and continuous focus make it a respectable dual purpose camera for video.  Zoom range is perfect for most applications, and I was able to buy a bargain adapter on Amazon to fit some of my very old manual-focus (Pentax) lenses, too!Camera Cons:  Fantastic for photos, but like many SLRs, when it comes to video it is still not a 100% match for a dedicated camcorder.  Still it is pretty respectable for video.  Though improved, focus sometimes has a slight lag (a known issue with Canon's recent generations).=====BUYING WAS A NICE EXPERIENCE:Delivery was fast.  Item was precisely as I expected it to be.  I had previously tried a T4i body with another lens bundle from Costco (that bundle was not an STM lens).  The noise from that lens was clearly audible when shooting video.  I didn't plan on shooting a lot of vid, but still I am shooting *some* video.  The \"chirpchirpchirp\" drove me nuts.So, I went to Amazon, and bought from this seller, and now things are great!ABOUT THE LENS:Thanks to the STM lens bundled with this camera, the focusing is COMPLETELY silent!  (YAY!)  The reach of the lens is extremely versatile.  To clarify, this is an 18-135mm lens projecting your photos onto a APS-C sized camera sensor (which acts as the \"film\" in the camera body).  If you're not buying an STM lens for this, you are abandoning much of the video/movie capabilities.A note for old-timers, from back in the time of 35mm film cameras:Some cameras have a full frame sensor (about the size of a 35mm film frame)  This is one of many cameras using a compact sensor.This just means that the bundled 18-135mm lens \"translates\" to what we used to regard as about 28-200mm.  I hope I don't confuse a lot of people with that, but those old-timers like me (who remember back to the days of 35mm film) might want to know that in your head, you multiply the lens specs by about 1.6x on a digital camera with a sensor of this size.  This is true of all APS-C digitals.  Nothing to worry about.  Just a side effect of the varying sensor sizes that are available.  Here's some more technical stuff about that, if anyone is interested:  [...]ABOUT THE BODY:True, this camera's grip is a little bit smaller than some other manufacturers, but I have rather big hands and it doesn't really bother me at all.  Try handling one at a retailer, and you'll see it isn't a big deal.The body is solid and lightweight.  The swing-out LCD is magnificent, and allows you to hold the camera high above your head for parades, or odd-angle photos; and still see the screen.  Battery seems to last me for about 500-700 shots.  The battery isn't bulky and a second battery is available dirt cheap (I've seen an independent manufacturer's 2-pack for less than $20), so if you need more than 500shots/charge, just snatch up an extra battery or two.PRICE, DELIVERY, ETC:Price was great.  Delivery was fast.T5i is basically the same camera, so price them both but realize you'll see very few changes between the models (Don't let the \"5\" fool you:  If you see a better price on T4i, do not hesitate to buy it!  Just make sure you are getting one of the STM family of lenses in your bundle!)OVER ALL:I would buy this camera again.  I would buy this camera for a loved one who knows a little about photography or who is looking into \"branching out\" into an SLR.  Not a day goes by without shooting!  The lens bundled in this configuration allows for great flexibility.It has been very reliable:  In the 7,000 or so shots I've taken, the camera only had one minor malfunction (it \"panicked\" when I kind of hit a lot of buttons at once by accident, so I just waited a minute or so, pulled the battery, and re-started the camera - and everything was fine)", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent DSLR for the non-professional", "Author": "bmcdanel", "ReviewID": "RUYUX3BEB7ML6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent DSLR for the non-professional.

The clarity and resolution are nothing short of amazing. I'm using the dummy mode (auto) at first so I can imagine that as I become more familiar with the settings and how to use them, my satisfaction will increase dramatically. I also love the LCD screen and the fact that it can be swiveled. I bought this to replace my 11 year old Nikon Coolpix 4500 that I never was very happy with and I'm glad that I did.**** On an related but very troublesome side note, and since the \"review the seller\" and \"Packaging\" feedback options are conspicuously absent from only this transaction in my account, I should warn others about the appalling lack of any padding or any effort at all to protect this camera and the accessory lens that I purchased with it. Amazon's staff simply dropped almost $900.00 worth of fragile digital camera equipment into a box, taped it up and shipped it that way. The box arrived smashed in but the camera and lens seem to have survived. I ordered this as a gift and needless to say, I'm not too happy about this issue. I order here frequently and routinely receive non-fragile items like lawn mower belts, for instance, that have been padded with literally 9 feet of air bags, yet Amazon's staff handle and ship expensive digital cameras as though they are worthless to them and to their customer.

And by the way, much better then the standard 18-55mm lens.One thing what I don't like about this camera is, that the Canon firmware isn't really useful besides standard photo-shootings. I would love for example change the burst rate, i.e. shoot in burst mode but with longer period. Or for example why not offer a feature of multiple-exposures, where I can expose the same picture several times. There are tons of possibilities I could imagine one could use the camera for, but it seems in this case, I would need to program it myself through an API offered by Canon SDK or just install 3rd party firmware on the camera :)But by the end of the day, the camera would not make you a good photographer it is just a better tool.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Upgrade!", "Author": "Sarge", "ReviewID": "R12EZ833DXE1MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded from the first Rebel to this one and as expected, a dramatic difference, especially with the STM lens that came with it.  In the two month period I have owned this camera, I've shot everything from landscapes, sports, portraits, closeups and movies.  The images and colors are just fantastic to this untrained photographer's eyes.  Where before I just dabbled in taking stills and some family photos, I am having a lot of fun now.  The auto mode overcomes my laziness to make manual adjustments, especially when changing lenses trying to capture live action events.  The video mode is a new feature to me as I usually use a video camera for live shots.  It is actually becoming more useful and fun as I get more experienced on how and when to use it, especially with STM/USM lenses in manual mode.  Unfortunately for me, this camera pretty much rendered my older zoom lenses and filters useless and that's where my costs for owning this camera have skyrocketed.  The USM zoom lenses with stabilization mode, while not quite L quality, are not cheap so in retrospect I may have gone with the T3i, which has most of the same features and quality of this camera, to offset the cost of replacing my older 75-300 lens/filter (I replaced it with the USM 70-300/filter/hood).  Still, I made my decision and am very happy with what's in my bag.  I am heading to Alaska in July and can't wait to use this camera there, perhaps I'll do a review update then.  An important clarification on my older lenses.

Initially chose Canon because of the ergonomics and better video quality despite having a couple Nikon fans in the family. So far, so good.  We have used 90% auto mode, and tried to branch out and learn the other modes as we can.  For a beginner to DSLR, I think a usable Auto mode is an important feature, and this one has been great so far.  The other features do what they're described to do, we just need to get smarter on advanced photography to make an accurate judge of them.As previous reviewers have said, the autofocus tends to \"hunt\" in video mode if shooting moving objects, but it's tolerable, and we don't intend to use this as a camcorder, so much as take a few short clips when we're out shooting pictures.  Doesn't seem like you can find any DSLR that does video on par with a digital camcorder.As far as burst speed in still mode, two observations:1)  Get a high-speed memory card (this is true of all DSLRs with the burst feature, and Amazon has the pretty cheap)2)  The image buffer isn't as big as on say the 60d.  The end result is that for the first second or two, you can maintain the advertised 5+ FPS, but once that buffer fills up (length of time depends on shooting mode), the burst speed will slow down significantly.  I knew this before I bought, and I'm not a sports photographer, so it's not a game changer for me.

I wasn't sure if I should spend more to get a low end 'semiprofessional' camera or whether this camera would satisfy my needs if I later got really in to photography. I can now say that this camera has plenty of features and complexity to keep me happy and I am glad at this point that I didn't spend more to get a more high end camera.  For one it is not too big. My amateur photographer friend recommended this camera to me because she got a 'better', but larger and heavier camera that she sometimes just doesn't want to lug around on vacation. I didn't want the size of a camera to get in the way. Don't get me wrong, you'll need a case and you aren't going to slip this thing in your pocket anytime soon like a point and shoot, but I wouldn't want it any bigger or heavier.  From the first picture we took on Christmas day with me jumping into the air with my new bright orange soccer shoes on and the shutter speed set really fast to minimize blur we were blown away by the picture quality and sharpness. It was unlike any picture we had ever taken before with a point and shoot. If you are new to photography you will have plenty to learn about and experiment with by adjusting shutter speed, aperture size, and ISO if you like this sort of thing to keep you occupied for a long time.  I found the site kenrockwell.com to be well done and very helpful when picking a camera. It was on his recommendation that I opted to go for the 18-135mm lens and I am so glad I did. If you think about it buying a second extra lens means a large extra expense, carrying two lenses with you if you are out, and potentially having to change the lens outside under less than ideal conditions. With this one lens we can take a wide range of photos without ever having to change. Its awesome and dead quiet. I don't know enough to tell you what you might sacrifice with this one size fits all lens, but for me its a perfect fit.  The touch screen is a nice feature too which allows you to change settings quickly and works well.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great.

At least that is my opinion.I recommend this version of the t4i that comes with the better lens. The lens is a $450 lens where as the lower model lens kit comes with the $90 lens. You only pay $200 more for the better lens. In my eyes it is the obvious choice. The lens is fantastic. It covers a large range (for a beginner) and photographs fantastic pictures.

Gone is the familiar loud click when you snap a photo -- here to stay is a quieter snap sound that's not as distracting (and would probably be good when you're shooting wildlife).Finally, the video from this camera is amazing.

Given all the time I was spending with the T3i, I thought it was time to get my own.I was torn between the T3i and the T4i but Amazon made it easy since they were both priced the same before Christmas. So, I went for the T4i, and am very glad I did. It's a nice improvement over the T3i.The most telling upgrade has been the touch screen. I admit I was a bit wary of this since I'm comfortable with the traditional buttons, menus and rocker switches. After using it for a few days I very much miss having it on my other Canons. Very responsive, allows me to jump to a setting more quickly, and just plain easy and fun to use!I do have to admit that Canon's claim that this is a \"smudge resistant\" screen is only partially true. It sort of, kind of resists smudges, but I usually end up cleaning the screen a few times during use.The other novel feature of the T4i is the ability to have continuous autofocus in movie mode. I'm more of a still photographer than a videographer, so that's does not make a huge impact for me. However, I have used it and it does work very well - I may start shooting more video now, and am considering getting the 40mm STM lens (although the continual autofocus works with any lens, it's best suited with an STM lens).Most of the specs of the T4i are identical to the T3i; a few have been tweaked, such as a higher frame rate, higher ISO and faster processor.I was a no-brainer for me to get the T4i when it was priced the same as the T3i. But now that I've had it for a while, I certainly think the added features make it a worthwhile choice over the T3i even at a higher price. It you purchased a T3i recently, it's probably best to wait for the inevitable T5i whenever it comes out rather than upgrade now. But, if you're debating between the T3i and the T4i, go for the 4, if only for the touchscreen.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective Item", "Author": "Sudarshan Seshadri", "ReviewID": "R3DCWI3PALYH7K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered the T4i with STM lens. Really happy with the lens,but camera had a couple of problems1. Freezing - froze half a dozen times in just one week of low usage (~50 shots a day). Only way to fix this is remove battery2. Optical Viewfinder - For some strange reason the viewfinder was just not clear. I had to rely on AF rather than actually seeing the subject clearly. Also, the setting snapshot that we see below the subject in the viewfinder was just not clear.Compared it with another t4i which had no such issues over the last few months. So forced to return it to Amazon. Really disappointed with the lack of quality from Canon.That said, image quality is really great. I have written a separate review on the STM lens.I am sure many have said this, but i would like to repeat  - Buy this with STM lens ONLY. Both STMs out there are really worth it and I have seen little/no difference in image quality when compared to some of the L series.Video mode has been mentioned by reviewers as a good try but not there yet - i've found the AF coupled with half press (in effect manual focus) for fast moving subjects does the job decently.I am waiting for Amazon to send me new one and hoping it to be defect free. Will update my rating post receiving it, but till then i would be cautiously optimistic in saying without the mentioned defects (1 in 10 pieces would be like this), this camera is a really good buy, esp now that the prices have dropped.Buy the 40mm STM pancake along with the camera.

I know touch is not necessary feature in DSLR but say it after using the camera for at least one day during the night time photography when you have to quickly change the aperture and shutter settings. It gives the fastest possible way to without letting your subject wait to long while you are hunting for the exact setting trying to adjust via control buttons (infact you would have already taken 3 shots in the same time with added touch feature). Another nice feature i found in it was hand held night photography mode which allows you to automatically take 4 shots together and then merge them to provide you the picture without blurring anything. this is very useful feature when you are taking pictures without the hazzle of carrying tripod with you. i also observed that this mode is better that auto mode in terms of picture quality/sharpness and contrast for night photography although you have to wait 3 to 5 seconds to let your camera merge all 4 shots to generate single picture with wow effect. Love it more than my earlier purchase of t3i which ended up in returning the product as t4i is better choice for the extra money i spent. i also felt that focusing system is little faster with any lens you use due to cross point 9 focus system, more telescopic lens you use, more you will feel that its faster than t3i model. decision maker point for me was its touch screen and autofocus system which made me fan of it as it was my first DSLR camera after using high zoom point & shoot camera. i know within one year i would be done by it as i already learned lot of things using it and feeling to get one more step ahead with higher end camera and thanks to touch screen which helped me a lot in my learning curve otherwise this learning path could be more longer for me. So if you are new in this field and want to learn first before investing huge amount of money in camera and lenses, please go ahead and buy it...I am sure that you won't be regretted. I have gone through all of the reviews and comparisons of different canon eos rebel models & 60D its most close competitor but after using t4i for 3 days i found that all thos low findings or drawbacks or cons were rarely noticeable until you stand with professional who can bring the difference to your notice by pointing the finger at the picture in 200% zoom ratio. I have Canon t4i + 18-55 mm kit lens + 50-250mm IS II zoom lens and 50mm 1.8 II lens in my bundle and i am satisfied as of now. I think i will jump on to more costly lens only when my learning curve with t4i is done and will upgrade to next level of camera. till then all the best to all enthusiast buyers of this product. you don't need second thought if this is your first DSLR camera.

I wanted a second body but wanted a lighter and less expensive model. The T4i was the perfect choice for me. It has almost everything the T5i has and it is about $100.00 less. Very good value. My T4i worked perfectly right out of the box. I have used it with two of my Canon lenses-one zoom and the EF40 pancake lens. It works smoothly with fairly quiet shutter noise. It is easy to operate-the controls are somewhat intuitive and very easy to learn. One of the best qualities is how light the T4i is-compared to a pro type like my 40 D. I know, the T4i is a plastic body vs metal. I'm not a bit concerned about the durability of this body. It is well made like all Canon cameras. I will probably carry this camera with me more often because of its reduced size and weight. I have large hands and the body feels fine in my grip-a little small, but ergonomically OK in my hands. The reduced weight is a pleasure to use and carry. I love the articulating screen on the back and like the fact that it takes HD videos. I bought a 16 gigabyte high speed SD card for a main memory card. The processor in the camera is lightning fast-much faster than my 40 D. Very good value camera body. Plenty good enough as a second or third body for a Pro, and perfect for the advanced amateur or beginner.

If you have kids don't waste your time with anything less than this.  It is by far the best camera I have ever owned.  I have had tons of the point and shoots, high zooms and phones with cameras (which I don't really even count, but had to mention since I see so many parents using apples to document graduations???)  My kids have been in sports for years and I have been spending money on progressively more expensive cameras for 16 years.  I finally decided to buy this since my kids are getting into high school and I'm running out of time to find an inexpensive camera that will take pics of them in motion.So far I have used this to take about 1,000 pics.  It is amazing.  The dial on the top allows you to select many generic settings that will make all the adjustments for you and give you reasonable pics.  I say reasonable like I'm a pro, not the case.  I'm an leaning as I go with this.  Once you get the hang of that you can switch to more advanced settings.  I have played with this some and they are easy to change and do change back when going back to the auto modes.  (thank goodness for that)Compared to other cameras in its class I cannot say how it measures up.  All I know is Nikon and Canon are the best.  I compared features for months before deciding to go with this one.  It came in just under my budget and had the features I was looking for.  Plus the price dropped upon the announcement of the T5i.  The T5i has better Video I think.The 5 frames a second is spectacular.  I have taken photos of my son at base ball games and it freezes the ball to the point where you can see the colors of the letters and stitching on the ball.  I think if I get better at the focus you will be able to read the lettering.  But I'm zoomed in with the stock lens so this may affect shutter speed.I also purchased a 75-300mm lens and it is impressive.  I went the cheap route and did not get the motion reduction one.  I do not see that taking pictures in good lighting that I will need it, or I can just prop it up on a tripod.I cannot express how much I \"enjoy\" taking photos now over it being a chore with point and shoot cameras.  This is what photography should be.  The Canon T4i makes taking photos easy and although I am new to these type of cameras I feel like a pro and my pictures are turning out like I want them to for the first time.Of all my electronic purchases including TV's, tuners, keyboards, etc, etc this is the one item I can honestly say I am most proud of.As a side note:  If you keep a couple different lenses in your bag, you will have people asking if you can take their kids senior pics, prom date photos, blah blah blah.

If you know nothing about interchangeable lenses, let me tell you -- a wide angle lens doesn't mean your subject will be tiny. The zoom capability takes care of that. You can get the equivalent of a 5x zoom with this lens. If you need more than that, get another lens or crop. Yes, just crop in Photoshop.LOVE: Image Stabilization, baby cakes! How many times have I ruined a shot due to hand shake? A thing of the past. It's built into the lens, though you can turn it off for artistic effects.ALSO LOVE: Shutter priority! Aperture priority! A real treat after the nearly-always-auto point-and-shoot. I'm learning a lot about exposure and the ways to get challenging shots and artistic shots.One last word: HDR. That stands for high dynamic range. Does it right in the camera. For the shots where there is a lot of light behind your subject, and you'd like to capture some of the detail in the lighter areas.

With the T4i I get a lot more flexibility especially with lenses. With the T4i/STM 18-135mm system I get great AF without the internal noise and super video in low-light. For my purposes of video inside a church, low-light functionality is the most important aspect. Now I am also getting far better photos, too. I saved a couple of hundred bucks and got more functionality but also more size and weight. A trade off I am willing to make. I have a lot to learn with so many more settings but I am putting in the study time. The one thing I didn't take into my considerations is the ability to run the camera off of wall electricity and that is a bother.

I have been seeing for months on youtube many videos which were created by DSLR's. Note: I was trained in Videography when I was in college and although not working in that field any longer I still appreciate great quality video. So I decided to try a DSLR and with all my research I found that Canon Makes some of the Best DSLR's for Video especially the 5D III. Since I couldn't really afford the 5D I decided to try the T4i. What a great decision. This camera shoots great Video and great photos. You will like the quality of the video and if you've ever shot professional video you'll like the Manual features.Also these days there are multiple companies that make accessories specifically for DSLR Video that you'll love. Most of which you can find on Amazon. You probably want to check out some Blogs and Youtube videos on how to shoot with DSLR's because it is different than your typical consumer video camera.Warning... if you expect to have exactly the same features as Consumer video cameras this is not the product for you. It does have similar features like Auto Focus and image stabilization (stabilization is great)  but the Auto Focus is no near as good as a consumer video cameras. You can hear the lens trying to focus in all the audio. Don't get me wrong it is good you just need to be aware of the extra noise in the background of the lens moving to correct focus. This is what I expected going in and I like to have more control of my cameras so this is a great camera for me. And for the price you can't beat it.Lastly you'll want to get a good Prime lens, something like a telephoto 50mm (I purchased the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens) A great lens for the price. Again this was expected and really another reason to get a DSLR, the ability to change out lens is great and again you can get everything you need at Amazon.All in all this has been a great purchase and of course Amazon is great.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "E.

I own several of their point and shoots and several of their DSLRs including the T1i, T3i, 20D, and 60D.  All have preformed very well.  The T4i is a different story.  It is very similar in function to the T3i and 60D.  Unfortunately, either the camera or the STM 18-135mm lens has issues.I shot approximately 300 images while I had the camera, and I was continually let down by the softness of the pictures.  I'm shot in different modes, at focal lengths, and made numerous adjustments to the settings.  The softness was still there.  Let me be clear-the softness was visible even when viewing the pics in Lightroom, without pixel peeping.  When I did zoom, it was very evident something was not right.To compare, I shot the same subjects at the same time with  myT1i, T3i, and 60D.  All were significantly sharper, and interestingly had better color accuracy than the T4i. I also shot the same subjects with my Nikon P5000, which is not known for its great sharpness.  Even the Nikon trumped the T4i!I called Canon, who as always were very helpful.  The walked me through  a few things I hadn't tried, but the issue remained.  I want to give Canon major kudos here for having a call center in the USA!  What a novel idea.  Than you Canon.So ultimately I decided to return my T4i.

I have a 'vintage' Canon S5 IS but it's more of an outdoor camera.I couldn't be happier with my T4i which I got along with the 18-135 STM lens. My assessment, after my own usage and reading a lot of stuff and reviews online, is that this camera is an excellent package.1. Speed and responsiveness- Being my first DSLR, it appears incredibly fast. Further research showed that Canon has indeed jacked up its numbers. T4i is faster than previous rebels in terms of shutter lag and is now closer to 60D (which still remains comfortably ahead).2. Low light performance- Another reason people opt for a DSLR is getting good low light performance. T4i doesn't disappoint. ISO 3200 is quite alright and if needed, ISO 6400 can also be used. At 12800 it starts looking like a P&S; camera working overtime. Nikon D5100 apparently has better ISO performance, nearly one stop better which means its corresponding numbers are closer to 6400 and 12800- but T4i has a trick up its sleeve- multi shot noise reduction! However, it requires a tripod.3. User friendliness- There is no beating T4i here. The touch screen is superb- so good that the camera starts encroaching 60D's boundaries in terms of functionality and efficiency. No more forgetting that white balance needs to be changed and quick change of , say, ISO from 200 to 3200. You see it; you do it- that's it! And yes, the touch to click feature- it's a gimmick but a good one at that!4. Video- Video on DSLRs has been a big hit and it's easy to see why. The video quality of T4i is superb and autofocus quite good, at least on STM lens. It's still not good enough for capturing fast action but very good for relatively 'low energy' videos. Especially with a dedicated video button, capturing videos in a pinch becomes much, much easier.5. Remote flash control- Sure, I have not used it but it ensures I will have something to look forward to in terms of advancing my photography skills even after a couple of years. It's not available on D5100.The T4i is a more significant upgrade from T3i (faster autofocus, faster processor in DIGIC5, touch screen, 5fps continuous shooting, chromatic aberration correction option (from 60D), stereo microphones and useful modes in Handheld Night Scene, Multishot Noise Reduction and in-camera HDR (better than D5100, again!)) than T3i was from T2i (swivel screen, external flash control and creative filters). Upgrading when you already have a previous model is a matter of debate but as a first DSLR there shouldn't be any doubt about which one calls the shots! In fact, T4i is so good that Canon had better come up with 70D to protect that line of cameras!The only sore point is the price. I got a good deal around Christmas but in general, D5100 is much cheaper.

The T4i is the first one I've personally owned, and weather you are completely new or a pro this is a great camera once you learn to use it.The auto modes semi-auto modes can take awesome pictures with hardly any camera knowledge at all. The manual mode and semi-auto modes can easily be used by pros to take great quality photos.  If you know how to use the camera correctly you can shoot photos in any type of light setting.  I shoot in near to pitch black darkness sometimes with great results.If you are into just snapping photos of whatever you might come across I'd suggest picking up several different IS lenses for different distances. Unlike most of today's point and shoot cameras DSLRs can't zoom from in front of your face to the moon with one lens.

Ability to do audio adjustments within the cameraCon's: Video recording is limited to only 29m59s. This is not explained or even mentioned in the manual. Plastic body (It's rather tough though). STM Lens is heavy, twice the weight of the camera (or so it seams).All in all, great camera for the \"prosumer\" in all of us.Here are a few sample images that I have taken with this camera.

The construction of the 60D body is slightly more durable, but Canon recommends not dropping either one. Other than that, the T4i is superior in every other way.

I have used T2i for more than 2 years, pleased with its performance and recently sold it. Before moving to T4i, I tested D5100 and D3200. I did not like D5100 due to lack of external controls and poor battery life. Same for D3200 and high noise due to high mega pixels. So finally settled at T4i.After using this camera for a week, I returned it, that will be explained later in this review.Pros:+ It offers touch screen (very handy when setting focus on live view),+ It has HDR (does not produce the perfect blend of 3 shots, but good to have in built HDR rather than post processing).+ It has Hand Held Night Shot feature, which produces excellent output with very good details in low light, it takes 4 shots quickly in low light and then takes few seconds to produce the final image.+ STM Lens (18-135) works as mentioned by Canon, there is no noise while auto focusing in video mode. It seems STM lens has electronic focus ring as you can keep on rotating the focus ring and it does not have a stop, most probably it uses internal auto focus motor of T4i.Coins:- The camera frozen 2-3 times while using, I had to remove and re-insert the battery to get it working again.- Since focus ring does not have any stop while rotating, there is not acknowledgement that you reached the bottom or top of the focus limits, you just guess.Why I returned this camera:-- After a week of use the camera Frozen again in Auto Mode (While Using Internal Flash) and showed error 50 on screen, I removed the battery and re-inserted, it worked, but when I went to Auto Mode again using Internal Flash, it showed same error. It's loop of error which does not fix changing the settings.It may be an issue with this piece of camera only, looking at the good features, I am giving 4 stars to this Camera.Edit: 11/24/2012I ordered a replacement for same camera, if it works fine, I will change the rating to 5.Edit: 12/04Changing the rating to 5.

I guess the lens only recognizes larger objects like people.  A bigger lens like 55-250 mm lens would be a great investment to be used with this camera once you get the hang of it.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "6 weeks later", "Author": "DonutAvenger", "ReviewID": "R1AM84V68Z42OA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "6 weeks ago, I purchased this camera from Amazon.

When shooting action shots using the sports mode, the camera shoots crisp images, and it really does keep going at 5.0 FPS. Finally, the Creative Auto mode makes settings like background blur very very easy to control.Cons:When shooting using the screen instead of the viewfinder, the camera focuses a lot slower than usual, and the max FPS is a lot lower. This is annoying if you really need to get into hard-to-reach places, but shouldnt affect you otherwise.Final Words:You really should purchase this lens kit over the 18-55mm if you do not have another lens handy.

For a beginner though you can't beat the features and 18mp is plenty for learning.  First of all for about 2k,  you can get various lenses in the EF variety and a cheap speedlite.  I have a 1.4 50mm, 18-135 came with camera. 75-300 and speedlite 320.  Bought cheap fotodiox lens hoods and gotta say for a budget setup, I'm taking some great photos.  Getting some great bokeh shots and the clarity/blur is awesome.  Even having fun in lower light settings with my 1.4 50mm lens and getting some great shots.  What I like is I can set it to some of the built in modes at first and see what the camera sets.  Then I play with aperture or iso to further enhance the shot.  Hand held night shots can be tricky but if you have a tripod or can brace the camera, it'll shoot 3 shots and blend the pics to make a nice rich night view.  Great touch screen and having fun with my speedlite, like learning to bounce flash in different directions and remotely for awesome effects.  There's lot to learn in good photography and you don't need 5k to do it.  Haven't tried the video mode yet, but just another plus for the camera.  The only con i have is that its not weather sealed like its more expensive siblings.

I wavered between the T3i and the T4i. I was hesitant about the T4i's touchscreen as it may be slow or that my fingers might be big for the touchscreen 'buttons' and I didn't want to be aggravated by having to struggle with it. Also, because T4i has features that are new, I was thinking that there might be glitches about these features or more product recalls, etc. The T3i, on the other hand, had been on the market longer and has had more reviews written about it from actual consumers. I said either I'll keep the T3i or wait for a T5i or a T6i. BUT, one thing that made me want to try the T4i anyway is that my T3i is made in Taiwan and the T4i, from what I've known, is made in Japan (this is an important detail to me). So I returned the T3i (from another website) and ordered the T4i with the 18-135mm IS STM lens kit. I am very pleased that I made the switch. First, the touchscreen is impressively responsive and precise, and the touchscreen shuts off automatically if anything is held in front of it or if it's facing against your chest while hung around your neck (saves battery life). The auto focus is so fast, it is practically 'instant'. I love the STM lens because I actually use this to videotape my dogs. I actually ordered it with the 55-250mm IS and a 18-55mm IS lenses that I will use for other purposes. I plan to learn as much as I can about this camera's features, and maybe photography too.

I also purchased replacement batteries as well for my longer vacation trips. The stock lens are also well built. I have not purchased and additional lens and I find this to be enough. The wide angle at 18mm is excellent for both indoor and outdoor photos. The 55mm zoom is great for most use cases but If you find yourself always taking distance shots, you will likely need something beyond 55mm. The Camera takes really fast shots in continuous mode and is great when you want to get those jumping shots.The design of the camera is very high quality. It feels very expensive and the grip is nice. It is easy to hold steady and the viewfinder is clear.

The Manual settings are easy to see, use, and understand. I have grown to like the the touch screen LCD and it makes altering settings very easy and quick. For photographers this is great, but as for people who make videos like me, I would definitely recommend an external mic. The in-camera mic pics up everything, literally.

I currently have a T2i and a T3i, and decided it was time to upgrade since I had a young friend who was taking her first digital photography class and needed a camera for it.  I sold her my T2i, which of course gave me an excellent excuse to get a new one!After reading tons and tons of reviews I opted for the T4i over the T5i since other than some video improvements, they are pretty much the same.  I don't use the video, only stills, so that didn't matter to me at all.Once again, I was really happy with the camera out of the box!  The improvements over the T3i were pretty evident, especially the faster fps speed.  I was all set to HATE the touch screen, I pretty much only use the viewfinder and just preview with the LCD, but was shooting the moon the other night and discovered that touch screen is PERFECT when it's dark and you can't see the buttons and dials!!!  Good improvement, I must admit!My main complaint with my Canons is that the colors seem off to me, I pretty much always have to fix them in processing.  But, there IS some improvement in this model and I didn't have to fix as many of the photos.The speed is amazing... I am mostly shooting running dogs and/or moving wildlife so I use the sport setting and keep my finger on the shutter and nothing beats these Canon cameras!  This model actually surprised me... it is sooo fast I had double shots of the dogs while they were still in the air when jumping!While working up the photos on the computer I was happy to find that I could tell the ones from the T4i because they overall, were MUCH crisper and brighter.  When I moved up to the T3i from the T2i, there was no difference in the actual photos from either camera.Buy this camera, you will LOVE it, especially if you put a nice Canon L lens on it!!!", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent - Canon EOS paired with Tamron AF 17-50mm", "Author": "T.

However, for the iPhone junkies out there, it is definitely going to be a plus.The camera feels good in my hands and my wife likes the way it feels as well.

Now you can't seem to find them together anywhere (brand new anyway). I suppose Canon stopped making them because they don't want anyone realizing just how similar the two models actually are, so they're selling the T3i side by side with the T5i at your local Best Buy so customers will actually see a handful of changes between the models.I opted for this CHEAPER \"older\" version. Keep in mind, this line of cameras is a \"consumer grade\" APS-C (crop sensor) body that Canon is updating every year like it's a new phone (with the same 18mp count mind you). \"Professional grade\" full-frame sensor bodies only get upgrades every 3 or 4 years. This camera only went on sale June 15th, 2012. That was a mere 14 months ago from the time of this post.This camera is still very much fresh, capable and well worth the money.

So, the purpose of my very brief review is to simply let you know that my SLR camera prior to this one was Canon's Rebel XTi model. I purchased that camera in 2006 so I figured it was time for a newer model. Of course this camera is an improvement over the Rebel XTi, however, what I didn't expect is just how much Canon's Rebel line has improved. The Rebel T4i's functionality, low-light performance and overall picture quality compared to the Rebel XTi is simply astounding. An absolutely enormous improvement. So, if you were like me and have a much older Rebel model, do not hesitate to get this model or the T5i.

To start, I love the how it tell you what the functions are for it reminded me of my old Kodak z712is. Any novice will appreciate this feature to help them along. 2nd, the noise level seems a lot more cleaner then my Canon t2i. at 800 and 1600 through some test shots. So that is a big improvement.Now, Another feature That is to die for, is the handheld night scene, I like shooting in the dark and this feature is fast and takes the image as you see it; to explain, I shoot using the P,TV,AV,M modes, now using these modes gives some control of how your image will look, with the exception of Mode M which gives you full control. The handheld  night mode you stay still and take the photo and it combines 3 photos together to get the image, the camera makes all the decisions if you are pressed for time I say use this mode for night photos, in addition, this mode only works in Jpeg not RAW.I like the switch turns, OFF, ON, then Video. when I brought my T2i the first I said was I was for an easier transition to video. Good job on this Canon.Lastly, I used my other lenses on this camera for a few minutes, more testing has to be done; I do notice that they are louder on this body. However the 18-135mm STM lens is fast and  quieter, the autofocus is decent, not the best but fair game. image quality is very good and this lens wide range leaves a window for some versatility.conclusion:This camera is not just for the newbie, mid range photo bugs and some pros would love the easy of the T4i. it a has a little something for everyone.

And since we got them, we've been doing lots of practicing, especially me with almost daily shoots. The cameras and the Sigma 18-250mm f3.5-6.3 DC MACRO OS HSM lenses we got with them are so versatile and easy to use for the novice and the pro-sumer alike. I'm having a great time working the in Creative Zone (where you control the exposure and lighting settings), while my fiance is learning to use the Basic Zone (where the settings are chosen by scene and largely automatic). I'm hoping she'll venture into the Creative Zone soon.I do recommend that you work with RAW images. The Digital Photo Professional software that comes with the camera is very powerful for post-processing RAW images. I find that, shooting with post-processing in mind, I focus on proper exposure and composition, framing, and focus, depth of field, etc. In post-processing with DPP, I can adjust minor lighting issues, high ISO noise (if I actually take a high-ISO picture), sharpening, white balance, cropping (because sometimes you just can't frame the picture perfectly when you take it).Another reason for working in the Creative Zone is that this camera, like all other digital cameras I've used, tends to over-expose the photographs. In the Creative Zone I have the exposure compensation set to -2/3. It is much easier to lighten a dark picture than to darken an overexposed picture. In the Basic Zone, you have very little control over this setting -- although some of the scene settings, like Landscape, allow you to select \"darker\" or \"lighter\" settings. But still, the Basic Zone is a great starting point when you're just getting to know the camera.One complaint I would make, though, about the Basic Zone is that if you do make some of the allowed adjustments to a scene setting, those changes do not hold when you turn off the camera or select another scene setting. In the Creative Zone, the settings you chose last time are still there when you turn the camera back on for your next shoot.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive but defective", "Author": "Craig W.

This camera is packed with tons of features and depends on which setting you have the camera in is whether you can mess with them or not. For example, if in auto mode, you cannot change much at all. The other awesome feature is the touch screen. The screen has a button with a Q on it, stands for quick access if I recall, which is used to mess around with several features. And the greatest feature, to me and any beginner photographer, is the helpful hints. Hit the Q to change a setting, then click on what you want to change. This will then pop up a small window to tell you what this feature does. Of course this does mean you have to click twice to change a setting, but wait, if these information pop ups get annoying, you can just go into the menu and turn them off.Another feature, which is outlined in the product description, is the HDR Backlight. All I can say is that this works exactly as described. Accessing this mode is just a simple mode switch on the dial. You can also have some fun with this if you are shooting a live subject, a person or animal or such, and create ghosting. This happens since this mode takes 3 photos in a row and than compiles them together.There is still much that I am learning about this camera. There is just so many features to discover. I have not even touched the video mode as of yet. The live view I am still figuring out as well. But if you are thinking of buying a camera, this one is a great buy.

I've had my eyes on this camera since its debut, I wanted to start taking quality pictures and video. I have owned two different canon point and shoots over time and really love canons build quality and results of quality pictures that they take. I've now owned this camera for over and month and have taken hundreds of pictures, and dozens of videos. IMO this is a great camera to pick up and learn the mechanics and functionality. I myself prefer to learn by myself, but I'm purchasing a model specific book on tips and tricks to produce quality pics. The camera itself is lightweight and feels very comfortable, even while holding for hours. The touch screen is responsive and quite useful. Future plans are to purchase a mid level telephoto lens, I just have the kit lens (18-55mm). It takes pictures quite fast for shooting bursts, it's stated I believe to do 5 frames in a blink of an eye. I was on the fence about this model or the previous one, I picked this one due to myself playing with both models at a retail store. Battery life is great IMO, but I would suggest buying a spare for vacations and such. I believe I will continue to stick with canon cameras for future upgrades. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make a step into DSLR cameras, but try the T3I and the T4I at a store and make a decision the previous version is a great buy now but I was more impressed with the T4I.

Absolutely one of the best purchases I have made all year (well, it is only March...LOL). I suggest a little reading, \"Canon T4i for Dummies\" or David Busch's Canon T3i Guide (similar model, almost all information carry's over to T4i seamlessly). You can take pics that are 100x better than a \"point 'n' shoot\" using just Auto Mode and the included 18-55mm lens. This camera lets you grow into it as you learn more. Soon you will move on to \"Creative Auto\" and then straight into \"Manual\". You'll be blurring image backgrounds and setting scenes in no time at all. Inside pics without a flash? No problem. Yeah, the price point for such luxury is somewhat steep, but these camera's (and more importantly, lenses) have some resale value that carry on for quite some time. So instead of a \"throw away\" point 'n' shoot, this is at least a slightly better investment. Remember, you're buying into a \"system\" and company so be sure to do your homework. Canon has been a leader in the dSLR industry for years and years. There are other big names out there, and all should be considered.

Place the Rebel T4i alongside its predecessor, the EOS 600D / Rebel T3i, and the similarity in design and specifications may suggest nothing more than a nominal upgrade.Indeed the headline specifications - 18MP CMOS sensor, 9-point AF sensor, 3:2 flip-out 1.04m dot screen are all familiar from the 600D. Look a bit closer, however, and each of these has been significantly improved, with an eye both to more seasoned users who demand SLR performance and compact camera upgraders who want a familiar feeling interface. The Rebel T4i also gains significance because it forms the basis of the Canon EOS M, the company's long-awaited entry into the mirrorless interchangeable lens market.It is largely because of the rise of large sensor mirrorless models that in today's market an entry-level DSLR must offer more than just high image quality to entice compact camera upgraders. In the age of YouTube, quick and easy access to video recording capability is a must. And for users that are far more familiar with composing via an LCD screen than a viewfinder, live view performance is of no small concern. Of course the camera must still offer users a path to a more traditional DSLR-like experience, without which, they would be hard pressed to resist the temptation of a physically smaller 'mirrorless' camera.The Rebel T4i is Canon's attempt to meet these challenges head on, with new features aimed at improving its live view and video performance. It becomes Canon's first DSLR to offer continuous AF tracking while recording movies.This is made possible by Canon's new 'Hybrid CMOS' sensor that now includes pixels dedicated to phase detection autofocus. The Hybrid AF system uses these to quickly set the lens to roughly the correct distance, then uses contrast detection AF to fine-tune focus. In theory, this should provide faster and more certain focusing for live view and video shooting compared to previous Canon models which rely on CDAF alone. You can read a more detailed explanation of this technology and see it in action on the AF performance page of this review.The Rebel T4i also becomes the first SLR from any manufacturer to feature a touchscreen. This is of the capacitive (contact sensitive) rather than resistive (pressure sensitive) type, behaving like that of a typical smartphone. In Live View and Movie modes the screen can be used to specify the point of focus and (optionally) release the shutter. It also supports iPhone-like multi-touch and gestures. The rear screen has been redesigned with no air gap between the display and cover glass in an attempt to reduce reflections and improve visibility in bright light. There's also an anti-smudge coating which aims to reduce the impact of its newfound touch-sensitivity.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Paul Kato \"Paul Kato\"", "ReviewID": "RNC1F2Y20X1CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, takes good pictures especially if you get off the totally automated mode and try P mode cycle time is fast", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "Jamal", "ReviewID": "R319PMXI2MVWVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

I only photograph with it,(no videos), and I could care less about the flip out screen.Fast forward to January 26, 2013.

Both times the camera was set in sports mode. I didn't have to delete a single picture because of action blur.The pictures were breathtaking.

I bought it a month after it came out with all the money I saved up in boot camp, and it was worth every push up!!It is also a camera I would let my Mummy in Africa use quite easily. It has a dial just for HDR's, so that even a beginner can take brilliantly exposed photos!!I would suggest buying at least a $100 tripod, $50 battery pack, and $20 cable shutter release if you are looking to use it for a longer time, are more into the creative/serious side of photography, or want to take some nice family photos.If you want to look at a plethora of good pictures taken with the Canon t4i, look at my Facebook photography page at:[...]Do me a favor and hit 'like' if you like what you see. :)Thanks for reading!!", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mixed report on Canon T4i", "Author": "Photocat", "ReviewID": "RCXOUVQ3E4L06", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received the Canon T4i and 18-135 lens through Amazon a couple of days ago and have shot approximately 1,500 shots since then.First the good:I have been comparing the AF focusing system with that of my T3i using a 50mm f/1.4 Canon lens in fairly dark conditions.In the non-live view mode, the 9 AF points in the T4i are all cross-type while only the center AF point in the T3i is a cross-type.In non-live view, the non-center AF points in the T4i focus better than the center AF point in the T3i even though both the T4i and T3i are supposed to have the same high-precision cross-type center AF point.In live view, the T4i also appears to be focusing much better than the T3i. Surprisingly, in the quick mode AF method, the live view in the T4i allows the transfer of the actual AF points not just a general moveable area that is available with the T3i in the live view AF mode quick mode.The Bad:I thought I had received an exceptionally good copy of the T4i until it began to intermittently freeze up such that I have to shut it off, take out the battery and restart. I am using a fast 32GB memory card and was not shooting in burst mode when it froze up. I was shooting single shot and not quickly. I aleady sold the kit lens that comes with it so asked Amazon to replace the body only. They cannot replace the body without the lens and told me to contact Canon for repairs.Also, please note that I did not anticipate that Adobe Camera Raw of CS5 would not work with the T4i even with using the plugin and updates. While this is not Canon's fault, you have to update to CS6 to process raw photos taken with the T4i. Since I always shoot in raw, this is a major problem for me. So now I have to come up with hundreds of dollars to buy CS6 or use Canon's Digital Photo Professional DPP) to process my raw photos. DPP is not as user friendly nor as effective as Adobe Camera Raw in my opinion.In summary, I was very happy with the new focusing system of the T4i but am not happy that I have to send it in for freezing up repairs already.1-22-12 UpdateI just received the T4i repaired back from Canon two days ago. It was found that the circuit board caused the camera to freeze from time to time. The circuit board was replaced. It now functions well. The improvement in low light focus over my T3i (that I kept as a back-up) is drammatic. The colors, clarity, and crispness of the shots are significantly improved as well. I practiced using my T4i with my two 600EX-RT Speedlites using radio transmision and the combination are exceptional. Rather than using a OCF E-TTL Cord (which I have) to get the master off camera, I experimented bouncing the on-camera flash into a reflector on a stand and it gave a soft, beautiful key light. I used the off-camera 600EX-RT as a hair light at 1:8 power in E-TTL and it worked great. I am changing my review to five stars after the repair from Canon.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW, I love this Canon!", "Author": "Karen Grant", "ReviewID": "R2PYYZKCTPNQ2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Haven't been able to use it much as yet, but plan to soon.

Thiel \"John P. Thiel\"", "ReviewID": "R196MOFQHQNB9S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Adding to my earlier review, I wrote the following to answer a question about shooting video on the T4i:Allow me to gush.  It's freakin' gorgeous!  You can get that true movie look with the T4i and unlike other DSLRs, the STM lenses made for this camera are virtually silent.  There are all sorts of videos on YouTube telling you otherwise, but they must have been using another non-STM (STep Motor) lens.I've spoken to professional filmmakers who raved about the T3i--now a dinosaur by comparison--saying they shoot entire feature films on them.Anyway, you can definitely take pro level video with this camera using the STM lenses.So why does anyone use a movie camera anymore?  There are all sorts of reasons including the fact that the pros don't use autofocus and therefore don't need a virtually silent autofocus motor, but if you want real movie making bang for your buck that an amateur with little to no training can use, this is it.One other recommendation: Get some kind of video editing software.  There are a lot of great, cheap programs out there.  On my iPad I first used iMovie and now I'm learning how to use Pinnacle Studio because it's a lot more capable.  Either one only costs about $25.LONG, UNEDITED SHOTS: If you're looking to shoot an entire school play or sightseeing trip from start to finish, non-stop, and have no desire to improve your video shooting skills, then consider this: People who do real movie making take very short shots, ten to thirty seconds max, and then put them together in editing.  I forget exactly, but I think the T4i will stop recording video automatically at ten or fifteen minutes to prevent overheating.So if you were looking to shoot an entire school play or wedding from start to finish, uninterrupted, you would be better off with a dedicated video camera.A better solution is to go ahead and buy this camera, and also buy a book called How to Shoot Video That Doesn't Suck: Advice to Make Any Amateur Look Like a Pro which is also sold here on Amazon.  Then not only will you shoot better video with your T4i, but people will actually want to watch it.  After reading that book, I took a video of my wife getting a haircut, set it to music, and it's actually part of my portfolio now--a less than two minute video of a haircut!WEIGHT:  Another issue is weight.  A DSLR doesn't seem heavy until you've had to hold it up for more than a minute.  You could use a monopod, but if you want to go handheld for those long shots of the ballet recital, then a smaller, lighter video camera is the way to go.  Professionals shooting video handheld will typically have the camera resting on their shoulder both for stability and just plain endurance.  Amateurs will use super light cameras so they don't get tired holding them.----------------------------------------------It's referred to as an entry-level DSLR but that's only in comparison to cameras that have capabilities you would likely never, ever use.  Look at that shutter speed, the ISO range, then ask yourself what extreme conditions would require a 'better' camera.  In fact I showed it to a professional photographer friend of mine and said, \"You must have really super cameras way better than this,\" and he replied, \"No.  This is as good as any of my cameras for nearly all shots.\"  And he liked the touch screen.If this is your first fully manual camera and you're feeling a bit intimidated by the learning curve, don't worry because it has plenty of automatic functions to make you look like you know what you're doing even if you never quite get the hang of all the settings.  Even if you used it purely on automatic, the capability of this camera versus a point and shoot is going to translate into better pictures.If nothing else, you can try a few shots in fully automatic, and then try shooting manual with similar settings just to see what happens.  It's digital, so free shots, and no regrets.As the Natasha Bedingfield song says, \"Release your inhibitions.\"Those of you who finally made the switch from 35mm film SLR cameras are not going to miss choosing the right film with the right ISO for whatever you plan to shoot because you can change this shot by shot in this camera, but you will miss the fact that shutter speed and aperture (f-stop) can only be set via the display screen.  These settings don't appear on the dial or the lens body.Still, just like you became accustomed to 'auto advance' versus flipping a lever to get to the next film frame, you will make the adjustment.  Especially if you have trouble seeing tiny numbers you will likely appreciate the display more and more.Also, the display tells you basically what making a change one way or the other will mean, such as lighter or darker, slow or fast.  It's not so much treating you like an idiot as making it idiot proof.If only they had taken the additional bold step of renaming things like Tv mode (Time Value) appropriately \"Shutter Priority\" and so forth, that would have been nice for both the veterans and newcomers alike, but I suppose some things never change.And lastly, I've read and seen reviews on YouTube which discussed that the lens motor does make some noise and that it doesn't focus as quickly as they wish it did.  While that may be true of the smaller 18 to 55mm kit lens it's not true of the 18 to 135mm STM lens.  It's completely silent.  I don't even here it on video playback.  And I was a musician, so I would notice.  And no problems with continuous focus as long as you have chosen the correct auto focus setting for your shot--there are three of these by the way.Bottom Line:  I love it.

If you are looking at this camera for that reason then do NOT buy it.The autofocus system for video is horrible, absolutely awful. I have the 40mm STM lens, which is supposed to increase speed and reduce the background noise. It is much quieter but as far as I can tell, it hunts for correct focus just as often and takes just as long as any of my other lenses.If you want video at a fixed distance where you set the shot up in advance and both the camera and subject are still, then the video quality is excellent. Though I can't recommend strong enough that you disable autofocus after you set up the shot. I have had countless instances in which after some period of time taking a video shot at a FIXED distance, the camera suddenly goes out of focus and then works its way back into focus. Ridiculous! So let the autofocus find the correct initial focus in normal photo mode, then disable the autofocus on the lens and switch to video.As far as video of a moving target, don't waste your time or endure the frustrations of trying to get the canon to maintain or find focus on a moving target. Its ridiculous. It hunts continuously, rechecks itself by going out of focus then trying to get back in, often failing to find focus for 5-10 seconds. There are many videos out there on the internet reviewing the autofocus of this camera and it is universally blasted for any moving subject.I have had far better success at using the manual focus to track a moving target than I have turning the function over to the camera.In all other respects the image quality is very nice and like previous rebels it includes a nice mix of features but if you came to this camera (or any successive camera using this autofocus design) in the hopes of getting a robust autofocus system for video do not buy it.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better focus than my T1i", "Author": "TGP", "ReviewID": "R30ZIT4RDG0W2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this a gift for my son.

My first camera was a Kodak Brownie Hawkeye.  I learned photography with a 35mm camera with a separate, hand-held light meter, and a depth of field chart.  I had to manually set the distance, F number, shutter speed and film speed.  Now, we have DSLR cameras that automate many to all of these functions.  My newest camera is the Canon Rebel T4i with 18 to 135mm kit lens.  At the present time, I also own the Canon Powershot G15 and the SX40.The bottom line is that the T4i takes excellent photos.  This morning I took 446 photos of the Laguna Niguel (CA) Christmas Parade, all on one battery charge.  (I used the viewfinder rather than the LCD screen.)  The battery was still working fine after the photo shoot.  Such a large number of photos is unbelievable.  Here are all the photos I took on my Facebook page:  [...] I posted every single photo.  I did not delete any.  You can view these photos to judge for yourself.  I recognize that a person can take terrible photos with any camera, no matter the quality or the price.Although I gave my rating 5 stars, I would have preferred 4.5 stars.  The camera should be improved.  The menu system is a mess.  The touch screen is screwed up.  I recognize that an entry level DSLR should be difficult to learn to justify the higher price!  The menu system on the G15 is much better.  Canon should test their cameras with select users for comments before they are released. The menu system should be completely intuitive, the T4i is not.  I am not saying that the menu system is real bad, but it can be and should be improved.  Canon can do better.  Tell me why the G15 has a better menu system than the T4i?  It doesn't make any sense.If you want an excellent DSLR that isn't overweight and takes really excellent photos, buy the T4i!  But only with the kit 18 to 135 zoom lens.

However, if you want to do something more fancy, you read to have training or read the manual carefully.2) Great video though somehow not able to take more than 20 seconds recordings.Cons:1) We took this camera for our vacation recently. The pictures were fine for the most part. Our last half of the trip, we started to get black images altogether. Not sure what caused it. We are still trying to understand what the issue is. The image is completely black. This is a 3 month old camera.2) For still camera pictures, the camera works flawlessly on most occasions. Video is currently set to 20seconds somewhere in the settings. We are yet to discover how we can make video that might be more than 20 seconds. We are able to get Hi-def images and videos out of the camera.3) Weight - It is a bulky camera and we cannot use it everywhere.

Some of this may be getting used to a longer lens (flash either won't reach when zoomed in or long lens casts a shadow when shooting close up); I am surprised to find that pics with flash are coming out slightly blurry (which is counter-intuitive). -- This is the reason for 4 stars (not 5)Pros:Great glass - pics are much improved over P&S; (I have used mostly Canon P&S;).Manual control - though most users will probably not botherHand-held Night Scene Mode: Outstanding! Takes 4 quick shots and combines them for proper exposure. In many situations, I prefer this to using flash (though will not always work). Great for indoor portraits / group shots.NEED TO KNOW:Flash card: you WILL NEED to buy a high speed SD card if you plan to take videos. Don't bother with the intermediates - go straight to the highest speed (currently Class 10 - US-1?). Not cheap - a decent size card will cost as much as $90-100 but you can shop sales (I found a 16mb for $40 on sale).Best investment for this camera will be a $20 UV lens filter - primary purpose is to protect your expensive new glass; buy this immediately and put it on the lens before you get too far down the road.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Peggy S Silvis", "ReviewID": "R1NVYAJOKL7W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lots to learn but it also has a point and shoot feel too so you get the best of both worlds", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "RE2IRGBXU5EYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is great.

However, there was an offer on amazon.com for a lens with $100 off. Yes, it was my fault... I was in a hurry because I was leaving for the airport and yes, I've learned I should not purchase items from amazon.com when I'm in a hurry. I'm a long-time amazon.com customer both professionally and personally. I was probably one of their first customers when I worked in our company's library (probably since 1995 or 1996) and used amazon.com for purchases as well as personal purchases.Going back to their offer... I used the links on the page where the offer was offered and put both in my shopping cart. Yes, it was my fault that it says it must be sold by amazon. I also thought I had updated the lens that came in the kit so the total price was correct. I came home, opened the package that was awaiting me, and started using the camera.I then looked at the receipt and realized I had the wrong kit lens -- and had been charged the full price for the second lens. I wrote amazon and was told I could return the camera if I had not opened it yet. Since I had opened the camera, I technically could not return it according to amazon and it would be a hassel to make the return and wait for the item again.So I decided that  I'm just not going to use amazon as  my main vendor any longer. I think their marketing was shoddy -- and if that's how they treat customers, I no longer have any loyalty. So I'm not saying I won't use amazon.com for future purchases, but I will only use them when their price beats their competitors. Yes, it will take me longer to make my purchases, and in the past I must admit that I didn't do competitive shopping if it was offered on amazon.com... I want to deal with companies that treat their customers well and don't try to trick them by having links to products that do not qualify for rebates. Yes, it was my fault, but I wonder how many others don't notice that statement or think if it's processed by amazon it is SOLD by amazon. My fault entirely but I want to trust the companies I deal with.As for the camera, it's fantastic thus far (but I've always been a point in shoot camera person so there's a learning curve). The lens in the offer is also powerful but again, I would check prices of competitors before I purchase from amazon again. One of my daughters has already given me some of the technical sites that compete with amazon.com so perhaps all of those high-priced purchases I've made in the past will be done through competitors in the future.

The one thing that disappointed me was the auto-white-balance when turning off the flash.  One of the key reasons to go with an SLR is the high quality photos at high ISO speeds and not having to use a flash.  I was surprised how \"orange\" everything came out when I turned off the flash and still have yet to figure out how to adjust the white balance to compensate.  Two more features I wish this camera had:1. Ability to remove red-eye after taking the picture2. Ability to edit white balance after taking the picture.The LCD is very impressive and could easily be used for both these features.  Also, the video quality, even at 720p beats the 1080p of cheaper point-and-shoot cameras hands down.

I also own a Sony HX9V and Lumix FZ47K, so I'd been looking for a decent SLR to take that next step forward, and I just don't get what all the hype is about.First, let me say the build quality on the camera is excellent.  I love how it feels in my hands and I love when I'm able to snap off several shots quickly.  One thing I loved about my point and shoot was that I didn't need a viewfinder, and this camera is HORRIBLE to use UNLESS you use the viewfinder... If you try to use the rear digital display to snap a shot, it almost literally cripples the camera, as the shooting time requires several more seconds for it to focus and snap the picture... But I was ok with that, I have actually gotten used to using the viewfinder and started to prefer it over using the digital display... The touchscreen is a nifty feature and appears to work great.But considering this camera costs 2x what I spent on my HX9v, I expected much better image quality.  It feels like I could have saved myself $400+ and bought the HX20V and gotten relatively similar results, as I've played with it and it provided a marginal upgrade over the HX9V as far as image quality and speed.  And to be honest, that's all I've seen with the T4I camera so far is a marginal improvement.  I stepped outside today and snapped a handful of shots with each camera, and that quality wasn't much better, and speed was only 1-2 seconds apart for capturing and processing the image...Truth be told, I bought this camera hoping for better indoor / low light photos, and while this is a highly subjective issue, I just don't see the value per dollar here... This camera has issues focusing on things that are dark or black -- my TV for instance, a black LCD TV--this camera goes crazy and takes several seconds trying to figure out what it's looking at, and even then the photo is sub-par... I get the same issue with my dog, a black Labrador...The camera is simply confused by dark objects... I snapped several pictures of my office and many came out slightly blurred with bad white-balance issues, as things had a yellow tinge to them... I tried switching through several modes and got only slightly better results than I would get with the point & shoot.. I tried to point the camera to the sky to catch falling snowflakes, and the camera couldn't focus on that either...Maybe my expectations were too high?  Or it could be I'm lousy with the advanced camera.  If anything, this may be an indictment of the entry-level SLR cameras, as the point & shoots are quickly bridging that gap in quality and speed, and they cost a fraction of what this does..  Please don't get me wrong, there is difference in quality... But for anyone reading this and wanting to take the plunge,  don't expect a miracle here... I've snapped ~400-500 photos of various things and do see some improvement, but honestly, based on what I've seen so far, if I could go back in time I'd stop myself from making this purchase because I don't see a drastic improvement warranting the cost...Which, again, I want to say I'm not entirely negative on this camera... It feels great, shoots fast in general, and takes good pictures...

The new silent STM 18 - 135 mm lens will be included in the kit instead of the 18 - 55 and will be available in Best buy on June 26. I will get the new lens when it comes out and these timelines may apply to Amazon and other stores too. Here is my personal opinion and \"non expert\" 2 cents on this camera.Basically, I was looking for a user friendly instrument that can take good pictures in low light and indoors because with good lighting even point and shoots take excellent pics. Obviously any DSLR is going to better in this regard than a point and shoot. I do not expect a significant difference between a comparable Nikon or Sony or Canon DSLR irrespective of the spin  \"experts\" and companies may lay out for us. In terms of photograph quality, the t4i takes excellent pictures but do not expect a dramatic improvement. A lot of megapixels or autofocus points or more cross type sensors, or more bits in the processor or frames per second is not going to make a major difference unless you are taking pictures in special situations.In terms of video capability however, the t4i should be clearly superior to most comparable DSLRs in the same price category. According to sci tech today - the imaging chip in DSLRs is some 20 times larger than that found in a traditional camcorder. DSLR video is supposed to look sharper, more colorful and cinematic than footage shot on a camcorder. Documentaries shot on DSLRs are supposed to be close to movie quality and superior to camcorders. The new upgrades including continuous autofocus, silent lenses, touchscreen display, stereo mic and improved ISO due to the Digic 5 processor are all aimed at improving the video capabilities.I was waiting to buy a smaller less bulkier mirrorless micro four thirds camera but honestly, they are still not in the same league as DSLRs. After some thought, instead of waiting to find the ideal smaller camera I opted for the traditional DSLR with enhanced video capabilities. Overall, I think the upgrades make it more user friendly and is worth the extra $200.  Once I have the STM lenses, I will be able to evaluate the video capabilities better. I don't expect a perfect camera but I think this will fit my needs and I hope that I will not need to change the 5 stars I have given it now.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as good as T2i or T3i", "Author": "Winhawk", "ReviewID": "R2XEMULG74B0EN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have used the T2i for a long time and really thought this would be an upgrade.

My unprofessional opinion is that it is the new Hybrid sensor, I beleive it is geared more for the video then stills. The cost is not much more then a T3i if not the same and just a 100 dollars plus a little bit for the 60D.

However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features.  Its the same old technology that has been around for years.  You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots.  The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.

True, you might save a few bucks in the short term, but in the long run the Amazon experience might cost you more!Less than 30 days ago I purchased from Amazon the T4i in kit form with 18-55mm EF-S IS II lens and a second lens that had promo pricing conditional on the camera purchase. I thought I had done my homework but it seems I failed to turn over a few rocks\u2014enough to discover that although great for stills, the T4i requires special lenses to record videos. Non-STM lens recording with this camera sucks because of poor focusing of even slow moving objects. The STM lens issue is not readily apparent when you make a selection from Amazon\u2019s EOS kit offerings.So, to make things right, I began a series of long phone calls to Amazon to try and work out a solution that included a swap of some kind. No two helpdesk technicians gave me exactly the same advice. Initially it was not going to be a problem for me to pack everything up and send it back at Amazon\u2019s expense\u2014they would even arrange to have UPS or USPS pick it up at my door. But when it came time to print the RMA for this, I discovered errors in which the language of the RMA did not match what I was returning, so I had to ignore that RMA.I initiated a new call, this time to the cameras specialists who initially assured me I could easily exchange the camera and lenses I\u2019d purchased for the camera kit that included an STM lens. This path got stretched out over time and slowly went south as I was ultimately informed that this exchange could cost me \u201cfrom 10% to 20% in restock fees.\u201d That is to say this exchange could cost me $100 to $200 dollars out of picket.With that I resigned myself to my being stuck with the wrong lenses but at least having discovered a valuable lesson\u2014that Amazon is not always the best way to go. My local Costco\u2019s has a 90 day return policy on similar camera kits compared to Amazon\u2019s rather misleading 30-day return policy. Amazon politely explains that if I send them my camera they must sell it as a used unit so I have to pay for the problem I created. To that, I ask who best to take a few buck loss, the little guy who has been a faithful Amazon customer or Amazon the multi-billion dollar corporation?My lesson learned (and my advice to you) when it comes to pricy electronics like cameras and lenses is to shop local where you have the freedom to exchange your purchasing mistakes and rediscover real customer service.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Received Recalled Camera 3 months after recall was announced", "Author": "Tech-Guru", "ReviewID": "RTVLN99J7HCOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera from Amazon in late August.

Granted with the T4i you can change lens, get a battery grip etc..but at the end of the day, add up all the extras, for what?

I use the SX50 for everyday use. Again, you really need to go into a camera shop and feel the T4i..and then compare it to the 60D, a heavier camera to see what I am talking about.

I took the camera to our Christmas light parade and was so disappointed, I was looking forward to getting some cool shots of the floats.  The camera refused to auto focus if I zoomed in at all and didn't do all that well when zoomed all the way out. (I wasn't aware at that time that I could have focused manually.)  It just doesn't like low light and that seems to include all shots indoors.  I've also found that the depth of field is very, very narrow when the camera is set in the auto mode.

I have had some trouble with the camera freezing up on me, it won't respond to anything, it won't even shut down!

The alternative solution is to get the STM lens, but that lens is a lot longer (because of the zoom) and less portable.2) The next best lens is an ultrasonic lens made by canon, which is acceptably quieter, but will cost around $750. For video taking, the auto-focus adjustments may be a bit jerky because the fast focusing feature of USM will adjust constantly as you move from object to object.3) The ultrasonic lens line-up options comes in a lot of variety, but there are always trade-offs. For example, to get this camera to work well in bright and low light, you need a zoom lens and a low-light lens w/ 1.8F (the lower the number the better it works at night). So to shoot well in day and night, you need two lens, costing around $750 per.4) It would cost you around $800 for the camera, $750 for a good zoom lens, and another $750 for a low light lens.5) Why pay that much when you can get a pocket-sized DSLR image quality lens with an 1.8F zoom lens for only $650 in a Sony DSC-RX100 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS?

Actually I was reviewing a review but that makes me guilty of taking up space and giving five * without any helpful information about the product.  Mea culpa.I have now purchased the product in question.  I have had only about an hour to fiddle with it before sending it off on a trip with the wife.  But as far as I'm concerned (and T2i guy proves, if nothing else, that this is a personal assessment that depends upon experience, financial resources, uses for the camera, etc.) an hour is all I needed to say: it's worth the price of admission. The touch/variable angle screen alone is a significant improvement.  Giving video its own position on the power switch reveals an underlying greater respect for that aspect of the unit.  Compared to the improvements from T2 to T3, this is a quantum leap before we get to what's inside. I've reduced to **** because my brief time with the camera left me with some doubts about the video auto focus and how supposedly quiet are the new IS lenses. But I can tell you with no reluctance, this ain't no T2i.MY BADDER than I was.  Being an amateur in the still arena (a little bit wiser re video that I've been involved with since we relied on Kodak 7242) I thought I was buying the new, quieter lens with my T4i or, owning lenses from my lost T2i, the wife's 50D, and my Sony Camcorder (FS100) I would have just bought the camera.  Thus the noise is explained.  I know nothing about the new lenses. I regret, as they say in Washington, that I misspoke.My wife has returned the T4i with which I will now have a chance to play.  But, just in case this is the end of line (or blog) for me, even before touching it again, I say again, this is a very cool camera and quite a leap from the T2/T3 era. Assuming the new lenses are as good as the T4i, I raise my rating to 5*. Is the \"leap\" worth the bucks?

I would go for picture quality first instead of fancy new features. My prediction is crop sensor will be a thing of the past and would evolve totally to mirrorless for the casuals. The full frame will become the standard for prosumer. So my take would be dump a crop DSLR as fast as you can, pickup a Mark ii or iii if you can afford it and not buy any lens that does not fit the pro body. Shoot, I just purchased this T4i, I keep on forgetting. I was side tracked about how great the auto focus video is. I will continue the review and would start with a 4 star for now. I will be back to give my 2 cents on this body. My recommendation would be to stay with lens that fits both crop and the pro body. The cheaper ones that fit both are 20-35mm, 28-135mm, etc. Get the \"L\" lens if you can afford it. They fit both type of bodies. Plan ahead because you are going to switch to full frame very soon.

I've been following Canon DSLR prices and releases quite closely, as I'm in the market for a camera.It seems quite a bit premature to rate a product with 1 star which you don't own, haven't used or even held, and haven't taken the time to research.This camera is supposed to add a lot of features from what I've seen/heard/read.1. Touch Screen - I haven't seen this on any other DSLR and it definitely wasn't on the T3i. Touch screens are how people have come to expect to interact with electronics. People who want Hi-end electronics think having to press multiple buttons at the same time and turn dials is complicated and antiquated. Even if it is time-tested and efficient once you're used to it. For someone entering the DSLR, and shooting something other than Automatic I see a touch screen as a great learning interface.2. Continuous Video AF and face tracking is another new feature aimed at point and shooters. The video quality of this camera will be much the same as the T3i but will allow new users (and users that haven't had good results with the T3i) to keep moving subjects in focus will taking video. Entry level users aren't going to spend enough time to perfect of the craft of manual focusing, nor do they want to buy an expensive rig with focus-wheels and such to film their kid's soccer match.3. It works with a new group of STM lenses Canon will be releasing.4. New Digic 5 processor which allows for 5 fps in continuous mode over the T3i's 3.7.Canon knew what they were doing when designing this camera: Bringing  point and shoot features into an already successful Entry-Level DSLR. By doing so they will probably also pull a bunch of users already paying $600+ on hi-end point and shoots into the the DSLR fold. This means they'll have people buying more accessories and lenses. A smart business move.To address any concerns about bugs, most all software problems should be fixable with Firmware updates and any hardware problems will be covered within the 1 year warranty if bought on Amazon or any other Authorized Canon Dealer. These are things any early adopters should be willing to do when buying a brand new product.All-in-all I'd have to say this camera is with the $100 price jump, IF it's overall feature set fits your needs. If you've been considering the T3i, wait one more pay check and get this. Waiting months for the price to go down is one theory but that's going to be months worth of great photos and videos you're not documenting. Photographers capture light to show their take on brief moments. How many are you gonna miss waiting for a $100 price drop. Look at the difference in features between the 2 cameras be low this.

It's curious that a product few reviewers (including me) have ever laid hands on is evoking such intense feelings and commentary.That being said, I like the T4i \"on paper.\"  I hope it proves to be a good step up in the Rebel line when it's finally delivered and evaluated in detail by the many pro review sites.But there are major concerns, which few are talking about on this page.  They are these:There's a myth that one of the reasons the T4i is SO dramatically better than its Rebel predecessors is because it has a faster burst rate (5 fps compared to 3.7 fps for the T3i). But that stat is deceptive and highly misleading. In fact, both cameras have exactly the same buffer (internal memory) capacity for RAW images (6), while the T3i has a superior buffer capacity for .jpegs (34 compared to 30 for the new T4i). The buffer data on both, by the way, has been widely reported by at least two professional reviewers on different websites. The bottom line is that for all practical purposes, the cameras will capture images at virtually the same speed, although the T3i may be slightly better with .jpegs. Buffer size is what counts, not burst rate (and the Canon 60D is better than both in that department).And there's a larger issue. The real reason most people will make the decision to purchase this camera is because of video auto-focus, and the new lenses which are designed to work especially with that function. Read any favorable review of the T4i and you'll see that's the main topic of interest with everybody. But one reviewer within the past few days who DOES OWN the camera said the video auto-focus system is a mess, unless you've got a completely still object (and if you do, for what do you need the auto-focus feature?). That hands-on reviewer, by the way, wrote: \"The T4i did a lot of hunting around trying to get good focus so if you plan on chasing a 2 year old while recording good luck! I will say that I used a regular photo lens and not an STM lens, but I just can't see see how the focusing can keep up with moving objects other than snails or turtles! It is still too new a technology and I'm sure the T5i will be much better at it.\"A professional videographer with news journalism experience -- and who loves Rebel cameras, by the way, especially the T3i -- recently encouraged his readers to think carefully before \"upgrading\" to the T4i. He described the video auto-focus as a \"deal breaker\" for him, since he always turns off that feature, even when using a dedicated video cam. He noted that HE wants to make the decision when to shift focus, rather than have the camera do it for him every time he moves it a few inches one way or another, or every time the subject moves slightly. It makes very good sense, if you think about it. He says here's why NOT to jump for the T4i: [...].The bottom line is that both an amateur with actual T4i experience and a pro videographer believe that the video auto-focus component of the camera will be a negative, not a positive, for most users.It makes sense to wait for further MAJOR improvements which will appear on the T5i. And it makes even better sense to wait for the next upgrade to the Canon 60D, which cannot be far off given the advanced age of the 60D. The next generation of that camera (60D) likely will cost only slightly more than the T4i, and will leave many purchasers of the latter with buyer's remorse.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "what a joke", "Author": "Antonio Lo Bello \"t-bello\"", "ReviewID": "R2PP6DMZRL2CJY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I understand that technology is a fierce competition, especially with cell phones and computers, but what the heck man.
