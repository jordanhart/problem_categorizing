{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Mixed Bag of \"Goods\"...", "Author": "Vladimir Ratner \"vratner\"", "ReviewID": "R2T8BJV7GJIK36", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a Valentine's Day gift for my wife.  I chose this particular model not because of the slimness, or the flashy red color (although both factors were considered as well), but mainly because of all the positive reviews I've read about it, and also the fact that I'm familiar with Casio cameras in general, and I consider myself somewhat of a fan.  I've owned 4 other models prior to purchasing this one, namely Z60, Z600, Z850, and P700, and all of them were good cameras, with some advantages and disadvantages, just like any other product on the market today.  This one, however, turned out to be somewhat of an unpleasant surprise, especially since it was a present for a special occasion.  But before I get to the actual explanation as to why I didn't like this camera, I feel that I need to mention a few things first.  As you might already know from my previous reviews, I'm not a complete newbie to the world of digital of photography - I used to work for Kodak, doing hands-on professional digital cameras testing.  It's been about a decade now, but I didn't loose all that knowledge that I got from that place, and in fact only gained more in that department over the years, since digital photography is sort of my hobby now.  So I do know a thing or two about apertures, shutter speeds, sensitivity, and ... yes, Picture Quality.  But I'm not going to \"torture\" you any longer, so here is why I think this camera is overrated, and why I can't really recommend it to other people.  Good things first though:PROS:- It's by far the best looking camera that I have ever seen.  It's slim.  Very slim to be exact.  It's aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  The red color is also nice - one of the reasons I chose it for Valentine's Day - it went great with the bouquet of red roses that I also picked up for my wife;- This camera is extremely Easy to Use.  The menus are very intuitive, and the Panel navigation mode is great.  A bunch of preprogrammed Best Shots is also a big plus, especially for someone who wants a simple point and shoot type of camera, and doesn't want to be overwhelmed with manual controls;- Big, bright LCD (also see Cons);- MPEG-4 Movie Mode is excellent.  First, it saves a lot of space, comparing to the regular .AVI format, and also can be used in 16:9 format, which is designed for widescreen TV's;- I was very impressed to find out that this camera can actually be used for storing and viewing Data.  Regular text, Word documents, e-mail attachments - it can all be converted to the camera supported format with the supplied software, and then be viewed on the display.Now, the Bad things:CONS:- Slimness comes at a price - sometimes it's hard to press the right button, even if you don't have large fingers, so be prepared for some frustration;- One of the reasons I chose this camera was its Best Shot modes, eBay one in particular.  My wife occasionally sells stuff on eBay, and always wanted to have an easy way of posting pictures.  What eBay mode does is it allows to take a picture of an object up-close, and then automatically compresses it to the allowed by eBay size.  Very simple.  What's not so simple, however, is taking that shot.  It's very hard to focus in eBay mode, and in Macro mode for that matter.  Z60, Z600, and Z850 all had eBay mode, but none of them had this problem.  Only later I found out (it's not been hugely advertised) that the closest range for Macro mode on S770 is 15 cm (centimeters that is), comparing to 10 cm on the other cameras that I mentioned.  That's quite a bit of difference actually.  But even at that distance it's very hard to take a sharp picture of an item.  Forget it if you want a nice picture of a ring, or any other jewelry piece.  The camera has to be properly focused, and unfortunately it's not that great at doing it up-close;- Yes, the LCD (display) is big and bright.  However, it's pretty much useless in low light conditions.  It becomes grainy, and it's very hard to use for taking a picture.  That's where you'll miss a viewfinder!  It's also not very good if you want to judge whether the shot was good or not by looking at the display.  What looks good on it might not look so good after you transfer the image to your computer, and vice versa;- Battery Life is not as good comparing to other Casio models that I've had.  Z600, and Z850's batteries seemed like they lasted forever.  S770, on the other hand, is not even close.  Don't get me wrong, it's not that bad, but I guess I just got spoiled.  What's also of inconvenience is that you have to use USB cradle in order to charge the battery - it's not the most efficient way, and you also have to very careful not to scratch the paint on the camera;- Weak Flash. Did I say weak?  I meant pathetic.  It's practically useless.  If the object that you are shooting is located beyond approximately 4-5 feet, forget about using the flash - you won't gain anything - might as well just turn it off, or cover it with you finger;- Image Quality is average at best, and I'm been modest here.  Once again, because the camera is so slim, the sensor size is very small.  What do you get when you have a small sensor? - Poor picture quality.  On a bright, sunny day, it's actually not that bad.  But indoors, or in low light situations, you will get blurry, grainy pictures, and will have to spend hours fixing it with editing software.CONCLUSION:I wish I spent more time reading reviews about this camera before I bought it.  If I did, I would've noticed that all the ones that are praising it, have to do with the fact that it's small, good looking, and easy to use.  The very few mention picture quality at all, and the ones that actually do, say that it's not very good.  So, to summarize, if all you're looking for in a camera is how appealing it looks, and how easy it is to use, then this is the right camera for you.  However, if picture quality is important to you (and I would imagine it is, because otherwise what's the point of buying the camera in the first place), then I would suggest you look elsewhere.  Check out other Casio models - they might be not as compact or pretty as this one, but they certainly deliver in areas where this one fails.  I actually chose a completely different route - I went with Panasonic DMC-LX2 (look for my review shortly).  It's definitely not your typical point and shoot type of camera, but rather intended for someone who wants manual control, and who wants to learn more about digital photography in general, as well as post processing aspect of it, since it also allows you to shoot in RAW.  In any case... as always, all of my commentaries are not intended to be taken word for word, but rather help you in your camera purchasing decisions.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R32MGH3IZQR5K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago for a trip to Vegas.  I also have a Canon S30 that I feel is just too much of a brick to carry, plus the capture lag is very frustrating.  I looked at most of the sub compact models on the market and was really impressed with the features and more importantly the size of the Casio EX-S600 that a friend of mine has (I wanted something I could put in my pocket and not know it's there).  I liked the similar size of some of the Sony models, but wanted an SD card camera (not a Sony proprietary model).  I was ready to buy the S600 but was then tipped off to the new release of the 770.By no means am I a digital photography aficionado so I cannot talk about the manual adjust capabilities of the 770.  But I can tell the difference between a good picture and a bad picture and I have to say the picture quality in Best Shot mode is great.  There's little thought involved - just point and shoot and the shot is nearly instantaneous (the lag was a concern of mine).  Colors are crisp and flash lighting is good.  The large wide screen on the back is great (way better than any of the other sub compacts I considered).  The battery life is also very impressive.Pros:-ultra small and light form factor-super quick startup-practically no lag on shot taking-awesome large widescreen LCD-fast 3x optical zoom (plus 7MP means digital zooming is finally really practical)-great battery life-SD card storage-great widescreen MPEG4 video w/ dedicated buttonCons:-almost too small to handle (I recommend egrips or equivalent grip tape for handling)-zoom buttons could be easier to navigate-screen susceptible to scratching (I recommend a screen protector)-picture is a bit grainy in really low light-sound recording just OK-wrist tether that comes with unit too shortOverall I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot", "Author": "StPaddy", "ReviewID": "RQB3L6PGAPHJF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this last week for a trip from California to New York City, and I wasn't disappointed with the picture quality of this camera.  Remember: this isn't a professional camera, and many manual options like Aperature Priority and Shutter Speed aren't available to manually set.  Using the \"Best Shot\" modes can change this (Fireworks, Night Scene, etc...), and increase the exposure time, but the camera decides what is \"Best\" for the shot.A definite plus is the MPEG-4 codec for the video which increases video recording time significantly in comparison to similarly priced and targeted Canon cameras that use MPEG-2.  When compared to the video from the Canon Powershot S2 IS (Which I also own) the video quality stacks up well.  The audio is only OK, but I'm spoiled by the stereo recording of the S2 IS.  There is a dedicated \"Record\" button right next to your thumb on the right side of the back panel which lets you record videos with one touch (rather than having to change to a different mode, and possibly miss your shot)All in all, I was pretty impressed with the quality and the ease of use.  There are many features, 32 \"Best Shot\" modes, decent operation time (the camera doesn't really lag very much at all).The only con is while the screen is VERY good - high resolution, crystal clear and more than bright enough to see on sunny days - the hard plastic coating did scratch pretty easily.  I ordered a screen protector on ebay for this reason, and I'll treat it with kid gloves until it arrives.", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Lukewarm review", "Author": "NJ Digital Photo", "ReviewID": "R20GA3V58Z2W2P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The EX-s770 has a lot going for it.  Its size and weight make it a great pocket camera.  It starts up very quickly and has a very short lag time between pressing the shutter button and taking the pic.  The screen is beautiful and clear, and the menu navigation is very intuitive.  I can make adjustments to white balance, flash, and ISO without having to fumble around with a bunch of different buttons.  It's stylish and sturdy.  The video recording feature is easy to use too.  So many good things....except the picture quality.  Because this camera is so small, they need to use a lens the size of a pinhead.  And so there is horrible barrel distortion and (much to my dismay) significant blurring in the corners of the pictures, especially in wide-angle shots.  And on top of all that, the noise on low-light shots is downright nasty.  I realize this camera is not a top-of-the-line SLR, but after being dazzled by how great the camera looks and operates, the quality of the pictures really broke my heart.  I feel like I have a brand new sports car, and every time I put it into gear and press the accelerator, it stalls.Think of this camera as the digital version of the Kodak Instamatic from the 1970s.

We absolutly love it. The pictures are very clear and it is easy to chose different settings to fit every situuation.There are two problems I find that keep this camera from being the greatest thing since sliced bread. First, it does not have a USB port on the camera. To get pictures to the computer you must use the docking station which is connected via USB or have a card reader to read the flash memory card. Second, if you don't have a flash momory card in the camera you can only store two pictures at the highest resolution.We love this camera!", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome mini digi cam", "Author": "Reza", "ReviewID": "R7671JITI2TMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it was the smallest cam for the price on the market.

The menus are perfect, everything made perfect sense. The button layout is perfect as well. Pictures come out really good, I did have to adjust some settings to get the best quality. I wouldnt say that these are the best pictures ive ever seen, but they get the job done. The video mode on this camera is also pretty nice. I almost find myself taking more videos than pictures.

Warren \"bigreddog\"", "ReviewID": "RIYJM1V3ZBA8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera a month ago for my birthday. When i opened it up i was astounded. The camera is tiny and extremely thin, yet it has a giant bright screen on the back. I'm an artist and i like to have my camera at all times, making this one perfect since it fits in my pocket along with many other things. There are many pros and few cons. First off in other reviews people said the flash was week and sound playback quiet.  These are both completely false, both are outstanding to what i have seen in other cameras.Feature wise it's decent.  It has a lot of good themes for taking pictures of certain things, and its extremely comprehensive.  Changing simple settings like flash on/off and macro mode are extremely good and easily visible on screen.  The one quible i would have is the lack of extra specific adjustments for getting the picture just right.  If your not a big time photographer the features are by far enough.  Now for picture quality etc.  First off this camera has a rediculous number of pixels for its size.  This is both good and bad.  Lots of pixels means lots of detail, and with the right lighting this camera can get some very crisp shots.  However in low lighting pictures can be blurry and if you blow up the pictures big enough you can see little bloches of color.  For the most part this is no problem especially if you are proficient in photoshop.  Video recording is excellent the quality can completely replace your video camera (aside from the zoom).  Which reminds me, zoom isn't great, but there's so much detail in the photo that you can just crop it down and it looks just as good.In conclusion this camera accomplishes all of the following- wow your friends, fits anywhere, easy to use, takes good big pictures, takes great video, and is generaly a great deal", "Date": "March 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great  Digital Camera", "Author": "C.

Size & overall ease of use  3.  Screen size.  4. location and ease of pushing function buttons on camera (husband's man-sized fingers & my small fingers) 5. Bestshot features and video ability.  This is the first camera we have owned without an optical viewfinder - we don't miss it.  The screen is clear and bright, easy to see in sunshine.  Before purchasing this camera, we also considered a couple of Canon models.  Only thing that would make this camera more perfect would be a bit more zoom, but you can't have everything I guess.  Love the red color, too.Pictures from the vacation and subsequent shots have turned out amazing!  We are very happy with the results.  Battery life was terrific also.  Some would recommend having an additional battery just in case, but we don't and didn't need one while the camera got heavy use on vacation (700+ pictures and video taken over 8 days).  Just recharge in the dock at night, ready to go the next day.

Nice big screen 2 1/4 by 1 1/2, so you can easily see what's going on--a nice plus.  This camera also has a nice \"reminder\" listing on the right of the display, so you can see flash setting (on, off, etc.), ISO setting for those of you that use that, and VERY NICE way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus, self-timer, antishake, ISO sensitivity, white background (am I losing you yet?), and so on.  One point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely, so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera.I've gotten some nice pictures with this, with and without flash.  A nice pick.Why not 5 stars?  cuz I've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices, although for the price this camera is fine and it'd be one I'd buy again, but it isn't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms, separate ISO settings, and all those other techie things that, frankly, aren't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating.Do buy a carrying case, as I have done, so the camera doesn't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small. I don't have any \"special fear\" about this but it's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into, so why not do it?As in all my reviews, I have no financial interest one way or the other in what I review.Also, don't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix, and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed.

Even with the macro setting selected, the camera cannot take close-up photos with any clarity--this camera will be useless to you if you want to take photos of small items to sell on eBay, or if you like to take photos of flowers, or anything else close-up, which is something I like to do.I turned the camera off after taking about seven photos and went to bed.  When I woke up the next morning I wanted to see how the camera did outside. When I turned the camera on, the view screen did not light up, but I thought I might have touched some energy-saving button by mistake.  The camera is SO small that I had trouble holding it without touching buttons, and had trouble touching the buttons I wanted to touch because the wrist strap is so short.Anyway, I took several photos of my two kittens, who were climbing a tree.  The flash went off each time I took a photo, so I assumed that pictures were being taken, even though I saw nothing on the view screen.When I uploaded the photos to my computer, they were blank, dark brown rectangles.The camera manual [which is on CD] did not have any troubleshooting item that matched the problem I was having.  When I examined the view screen under very bright light, I could see the menu very faintly, and a message saying \"Underexposed.\"  My husband and I could not get the view screen to come back, so we had to return the camera.I don't know if this is poor quality control or what, but the camera essentially broke the second time I tried to use it.  Even if it hadn't conked out, I still would have been disappointed with the hard-to-grip style of the camera and small buttons, small wrist trap, and terrible close-up lens.

I am writing this review now to give an impression of our normal usage and how the Exilim has performed.I have been extremely pleased.  The big pluses are:* FAST! Camera turns on and is ready to take pictures almost instantly! - one of the criteria I looked at closely when purchasing was the \"boot\" time.  We tested the display models at a store before purchasing.  This model was the fastest by far.* SD card easy to access - I strongly recommend purchasing a large SD card and a card reader for your desktop or laptop.  It makes transferring and managing your images fast and simple.* Comes with excellent dock - I have come to love a good docking station for electronic products.  The Exilim comes with a dock that is well designed and works great for recharging.* Is very slim - this is truly a pocket camera.  The best camera is the one you have with you.  Period.* Large screen size - nearly the entire back of the camera is screen!*Takes great pictures - we have taken some pretty spectacular outdoor images.  As is typical of digital cameras, indoor images are fairly grainy and not nearly as lovable.  However, it performs as well or better than other small digitals I have used indoors.*Battery - we have never had problems with the battery life during normal vacations.  The occasional recharge at home is all we need.  The battery has also survived a year of normal use without showing signs of age.  If it does become a problem, Casio has made it extremely simple to swap out batteries - it's a matter of seconds.Summary: if you're looking for a small camera that can be kept on hand and trusted for special occasions like vacations, I highly recommend the Exilim EX-S770.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Simon Yung", "ReviewID": "R3QV47TVKYPYZ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i like this camera a lot. i've owned 3 other casio models (ex-m20, ex-s500, ex-s600), 1 samsung (nv10), and 1 canon (sd750) and i like this one the most. i'll admit that it's really easy to get a good shot with the samsung and the canon, so people might prefer them over the casios, but i feel like i've got a good enough understanding of the casio to get the results that i want. so in regards to picture taking, it's really up to the user how well the images come out.one reason i really enjoy this camera is the extent to which i can customize it to my liking. it really is only a few things, like a few customizable buttons and the ability to choose which settings the camera will remember. but the menu layout is very very intuitive to begin with, so the camera is very enjoyable to use apart from the customizing features. another minor (but great) feature is the adjustable flash intesity - really good for avoiding over-exposure in closer shots.i'm big on videos and this camera is awesome for that! i don't understand what other reviewers are saying when they only say that the sound is \"ok.\" i think the sound is pretty good (i've compared it with various other manufacturers and models). the only camera that is better in sound capture quality (in my opinion) is the canon sd750. but the only setting where the sd750 outshines the ex-s770 is when you're trying to record a video of a live concert. i discovered this 'cause my gf had the sd750 before i did. this is actually what made me purchase the sd750. however, 1 week into playing with the canon, i realized that the canon saves videos in a very large file format. so this is where the ex-s770 ends up being on top again. on a blank 2BG SD card, i was only able to get 16 minutes (640x480 @ 30fps) on the sd750 (seriously, WTF?!). but with the ex-s770 (same quality settings) i was able to get a little over 2 hours and i still considered the sound quality to be quite excellent.another neat feature that shouldn't be weigh in too much in your decision - but still worth mentioning - is the data feature. it allows you to convert any type of data file and have it upload directly to your camera. i use it for train maps and schedules. again this isn't a big deal at all. if you've already got an a smartphone, you can already do that and prob even more. but still, it's there if you want to use it.ok, this is too long. but the above reasons are why i ended up choosing the casio exilim ex-s770.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Some flaws but still a great camera", "Author": "Robbie", "ReviewID": "R2VTSBYKMLZRJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Things I like:Video quality is superb - unbelievable from such a little device.

It is definitely not the best as others have mentioned. I have a 4MP pentax, now a few years old, that manages similar quality pictures. the Casio photos have a slightly soft fuzzy feeling, very noticible viewed on the screen at 100% but not much to worry about when viewed screen size or printed.Things I don't like so much:Can't do a one touch switch to picture taking mode from review mode. e.g. with my Pentax you are reviewing photos, see something you want to take a picture of and you tap the shutter release and you are back in action.Doens't prompt before deletion of single photos.  Have lost a couple of photos through this.Can't recharge the battery separate from the camera.  To recharge you have to dock the whole camera meaning you can't be charging a spare while still shooting.

I accidentally drop it from about 5 feet and it landed on gravel with rocks).  The camera now has a big dent on it but still works great.-takes decent/normal video.-I came from a 3.2 Mpixel camera from this so the pictures blew me away. I liked the picture quality that I now use it instead of my DSLR when I want good pictures during informal events.-took the exilim on a tropical beach for vacation and the pictures that came out are beautiful.  Turned me into a shutterbug during that trip...I was taking 100 to 300 shots per day...LOVE it!CONS:-make sure you have the cam's cradle to charge the camera!-flash sucks (but same goes to other point and shoot cameras) so, just try not to use the flash or just accept washout pics at night when using flash.

I used it in low light settings, with the flash off in museums, out the window on a bus tour, at night, in the day time, while walking.. anything you can thing of I did. It worked out perfectly. I thought that the picture quality was amazing and it is extremely simple to use. If you want a small compact flashy camera where you do not have to constantly adjust the settings, this is the perfect camera.I do not have much experience with camera knowledge, but the picture quality to me seemed perfect. I do not use it for making pictures large, but just to have my own personal pictures and send to others, as well as print out 3x5's.I actually dropped my camera off of a cliff, climbed down to get my memory card (of course the camera was broken) and I just bought the exact same one today.)

I previously had the EX s700 and my girlfriend destroyed it in her bag with hair products. I am 100% completely satisfied with this item. I am a tech person so buying this camera I knew had to meet my standards and it did. The pixel count is incredible in bright light the quality easily rivaled those of more expensive cameras. Low light situations posed no problem. The flash was bright in the dark and shed light on the subject with even distribution. The movie quality proves easily that one does not need a seperate camcorder. I easily recommend this camera and the s700 for everyday practical use and the outcome is professional looking or should I say professional quality pictures.Casio Exilim EX-S770RD 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Red)", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Casio Exilim EX-S770 7.2MP Digital Camera", "Author": "Neale Fetterly", "ReviewID": "RC9J1TN9GGF8Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Previously had Exilim Z-60 which was excellent - I gave that to a daughter to take to University and got this one which is slightly bigger.
