{"Reviews": [{"Title": "High above average", "Author": "Auto", "ReviewID": "R3J6PR4CM4G4NI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This an excellent small (pocketsized) camera. You can manage it as you like if you are that sort of a photographer, or you can set the EXR on and the camera does the job for you. The shutter works in real time. The zoom is x15 times and is in fact outstandingly sharp.Compared to my Olympus E-400, which is much bigger even though it is the lightest reflex camera, the colours of the photos might be a bit duller from the Fujifilm Finepix, but it is something you will not detect unless you take identical photos on both cameras at the same time.Recently I made about 250 exposures in one day, about 50 thereof with flash, before the camera announced that the battery needed recharge.Bottom line: This camera is excellent, handy and quick to use. You can have it in your shirt pocket even if it is a bit heavier than some less reliable small cameras. -- This is my third FinePix camera and they have all been high above average.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purse Size and all the features of a full-size SLR", "Author": "Marcine E. Lohman", "ReviewID": "RCCTCMX0QSLP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm reviewing this while on vacation and am using my Fujifilm FinePix F600EXR exclusively on this trip.  I absolutely love it and will NOT be going back to my old full-size SLR Digital Camera - I love it that much.PROS:  (1)  Zoom is fantastic.  I simply nudge the ring around the shoot button to zoom in or out.  It's very convenient since your finger is usually already there.(2)  The focus is also excellent - I was shooting photos from a \"very bumpy\" trolley ride and my photos still turned out great and clear.  I had it set on EXR auto mode.(3)  I also got some good photos in Panoramic mode although it took me awhile to get the hang of it.  I like that I can set the mode then just scan the camera across and it creates the panoramic print for me.(4)  I was able to take photos in very low light which surprised me.(5)  I also like to take photos of old genealogy photos (that relatives don't trust you to get a copy made at Walgreens and return it) and it worked great for that - much better than my old SLR.(6)  Shooting video's is super easy - just press the video button to turn it on or off.  That's it!  And the microphone is also great.  I video'd a church organ playing and it blew me away when I played it back.  The video's are better than what I get on my Kodak PlaySport Pocket Camcorder.(7)  You can turn the sound off so that no noise is heard when shooting.  Comes in handy when you do't want to scare wildlife or don't want someone to know you're taking a photo.CONS:  (1)  The GPS feature drains the battery fast.  Really fast.  Don't set it to \"Permanently On\" or it will drain the battery even when turned off.  I set it to \"When Switched On\" which is better but sometimes I turn it off alltogether when I'm on a tour and don't want to risk a drained battery.  I have three spare batteries just in case and I definately suggest a spare.(2)  In bright sunlight, it's hard to see the viewscreen but that seems to happen on all my screens.  I almost wish they still had a viewfinder for those moments.(3)  I can't tell if the flash will come on automatically as it hasn't done it yet but I've found that to be a good thing as many places I've visited don't allow flash photography.  I just tried to turn the flash on following the book and am having problems - apparently I have it turned off.  It's not easy to get it back on.Even with the cons, I would still highly recommend this camera.  It fits perfectly in my purse, is lightweight and offers all the features of a full size digital camera.  You can use it in auto mode or set your camera to Manual and set the shutter speed, ISO, etc. yourself.  You can even manually type in the location of your photos which is handy if the GPS offers a different location.  I give this camera an A+.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm finepix f600 exr Digital camera 16 MP, 3.0 LCD", "Author": "R.
