I used it the weekend before on dry land and thought it did a great job - especially shooting \"Wide screen\" video.We left for our cruise and took the Pentax on our first beach day.  Used it snorkeling (note I stay on the surface and never dive down so the camera would never be more than 3 feet submerged) and took fabulous underwater photos and video.  I was very pleased.When we returned to our cabin, some hours after leaving the water, I took out the battery and put it in the charger and also downloaded the photos & video into my computer.  Next morning, however, I took the battery out of the charger and noticed the contacts were all corroded.  Looked inside the camera and the same thing.I managed to get it working and it took photos one more day.  Drained the battery during another water-filled day.  I could never get the battery to charge again.  Sadly, I had no waterproof camera to use during the two remaining water fun days.Returned the camera to Amazon and will be shopping for something similar but more \"Waterproof!\"", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cheap insurance for your DSLR", "Author": "P. Chin", "ReviewID": "R39X19DKAIN3IW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just got it today and here's my 2 cents' worth.  It's cheap, [...], a cheaper version of Pentax W80. So please have realistic expectations.  Yes, I've read the reviews before I bought it(see [...]).  Other sites haven't bothered to review it.  The noise and image quality issue is well known, as panned by the reviewers herein.  The picture is too soft, too dull.  But it fits my strategy. I need an inexpensive splash-proof camera for use while sailing. Getting any picture is better than getting no picture.  For better quality shots, I can use a Panasonic TZ5 in a Dicapac waterproof pouch and look real dorky.  Near future replacement for the TZ5 for me could be the Sony HX5 or the Panasonic ZS5.  For dry conditions, I have a Sony A200 and A300 DSLR at my disposal.I also have a Pentax Optio W10, bought in 2006. After taking a few comparison shots with these two Pentax cameras, I can confirm that the WS80 is noisier than the W10 at the same ISO 400, but the WS80 still has more resolution, less pixelated than the W10.  The extra 4 MP help.  The WS80 is also better in some other ways  - 5x zoom, cost, 720 movie, and kinda IS?  One ergonomic problem I have with the WS80 is that I find it hard to fully depress the shutter button without causing some camera movement.  My tweaks on the camera setting: set ISO at 200; crank up the sharpness and contrast in the P mode and do more post editing and add still more contrast.  There's a little too much yellow, esp on grass.If you want something more rugged with better image quality, then spend more money, ~$200+ more for a Panasonic TX1, TX2, Sony TX5 or Pentax W90.  (Sorry, Canon looks too toyish and bulky.) For me this is cheap insurance against water damage to the DSLRs.  Sailing pictures taken in brighter lights this summer may turn out OK then.

Overall, for the price of the camera it takes OK pictures.  If I wanted great quality pictures I would have bought a more expensive waterproof camera.  I did however, buy this camera because it is waterproof.  I did not buy it for the intent of snorkling but it will be exposed at some point to rapids, snow, and rain.  After these entounters and no problems I will gladly raise this review to a five.Camera is very easy to use.  Takes nice pictures although on some pictures it looks a little blury in the background.  When the shutter is pressed I experienced no delay even indoors.  It was very easy to download pics to computer.Overall, I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants a nice easy to use waterproof camera and is not to fussy about perfect pictures everytime.

I like the fact that the camera is water proof so I do not have to worry about using it around water.  Also, I like the feature that the zoom lens is encased so the lens does not constantly extend then compact every time you turn it on/off.  The 5X optical lens is very sharp and even the digital zoom is quite sharp.  Although the manual is thicker than the camera, it comes with a quick guide to let you start taking pictures quickly.  I can always read the manual on an as-need basis if necessary.I have owned a Pentax camera before (Optio S sub-compact)and really liked it also. However, this camera is much easier to use and produces very sharp photos.

I considered other small models by Canon, Sony, Olympus, Pentax and even Fuji.  This one was waterproof (at least splashproof) and did 720p video at 30fps.  The waterproof Pentax W60 lacked 720p/30fps and the W80 had poor image quality since bumping the sensor to 12MP.  I thought this camera might have been the best of both worlds.  It is nice and small.  The picture quality is so terrible, I'm sending this back to Amazon ASAP.  I tried changing the ISO to 100, made sure I was in the highest quality mode.  But, no luck.

In film, started with Canon SLR's (AE-1, then A-1), switched to Nikon 20 years ago (FM2, multiple N8008 bodies), have also owned medium format (Rolleicord, Yashica, Mamiya 645..)  Current outfit is much simplified - a Nikon D80 digital SLR with a bunch of lenses...Have also owned lots of digital point and shoots - from the Sony Mavica (remember saving to floppy disc?) through some Sonys and Canons.My latest Canon point-and-shoot (the one my wife uses) died recently, and since we live near the beach and have a pool (and three small children who shoot pictures) I thought I'd get something waterproof as well as small.  Did not want to spend a lot of money on that - I have enough money in cameras, thank you very much - and it looked like the Pentax fit the bill.Oops.Although the Pentax seems like it might be a good camera for some people, for me picture quality is paramount.  If the camera doesn't take good pictures, you might as well not take them.Pentax did a good job with exposure (with and without flash) but despite the megapixel count the final image was always \"noisy\" - a grainy-looking effect, noticeable without an extreme amount of magnification.  I tested this under every condition I could think of - bright sunlight, shade, indoors with flash, and with the camera at every setting (ISO and picture size) that I could think of.  Same result.I did NOT test the underwater capabilities of it.  Given that it could not produce acceptable pictures for me above water and I was going to return it (which I did) I didn't want to risk having something happen to it in the water.Now... one might think \"that's just the way small cameras are\" but I've tested multiple \"non-underwater\" cameras in the same price range and they take MUCH better pictures.  For example, I've replaced this with a Canon SD780IS and it's flawless...So... again, the picture quality is not AWFUL, I'm sure if your only purpose is to post pictures on Flickr or print 4x6's (or 5 x 7's, maybe) most normal people would not be able to see what I'm talking about, but if you're a somewhat fanatical photographer I can't recommend this one.Perhaps it's a side effect of the underwater nature of it, I've seen similar reviews that suggest if you go to a higher end UW camera the picture quality gets better, but for me I was not willing to spend twice as much to find out - we'll just have to keep the kids away from our Canon at the beach and pool.Again, if you're looking for an inexpensive camera that's supposed to be waterproof and aren't too picky about picture quality (if camera phone pictures look good to you!) then this might be the one, but not for me...", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "do not buy", "Author": "James E.

I was little worried that many reviewers stated about bad image quality. I give it a try and took it to wisconsin dells waterpark and took some pictures/ video clips at indoors & outdoors.Image Quality:Well, my advise is, alway put ISO manually at lowest setting. (yes, even at outside)I believe this camera is intended for outdoor use, unless plenty of lighting system is setup in indoor.Picture (or Video) quality is okay when there are enough light w/ ISO setup at 64 or 100.I would not even waste time trying to take a good picture if any of above are missing.Optical Zoom:I rather put it at 1x zoom and take a picture/video as I think you loose the image quality when you zoom it.And I would definitely turn off digital zoom.720P Video:There is no HDMI input. After I recorded (max. length is about 11 min. per record) some clips, I saved to PC and they played straight without any conversion. (avi format) Quality? well, it's not crystal crisp clear, but okay enough to watch in my 55\" LCD TV. You can zoom while recording, but the image quality will get fuzzy as recording is still focused to your original zoom setup.Waterproof:This was the main feature I liked the most. I recored many video clips at indoor+outdoor water parks. I recorded while on water slides, artificial waves, underwater (at typical 4-5ft pool), etc. Played (w/ sounds) pretty good and there's no sign of leakage.Overall, it is okay camera (+ video recorder) as long as shooting outside when there's enough light.I would not recommend if you're looking for indoor use camera.

It fits perfectly into every aspect I'd been looking for the past year, however I did not purchase it for underwater photography but as a resistant land camera, which it is! Most digital cameras are not water resistant so even a little drizzle at a concert or splash at the beach can ruin your camera for good; this is the maximum water ventures my camera is scheduled to have and the most I would recommend for anyone to expose their unit to. I work with digital cameras and when I purchased this one a heated debate began among my co-workers about \"waterproof electronic devices\"; it seems to be an oxymoron. We concluded that \"waterproof electronics\" are built for resistance and recommendable in that regard but should be kept on dry land because they tend to not work as advertised. Personally, I will not be experimenting for Pentax with the Optio WS80, the only camera I might put to the test (depending on customer reviews once it has been on the market for at least a year) is the Optio W90 but note I wrote \"might\". Meanwhile, for the rare occasions I do underwaterphotography I will go with the tried and true film cameras built for this purpose.I needed a camera with a lens that would not extend and had 5x optical zoom (as opposed to electronic zoom), the non-extendable lens is typical of waterproof cameras but most only have 3x zoom which is not enough for me because I love candids and close-ups. I also needed a decent built in flash because remember I was looking for a resistant land camera but most waterproof cameras either lack a flash altogether or have one that seems to be for simple decoration, on this I gambled because I had to wait to receive it before I could confirm anything. Now that I have taken some night shots, I have no complaints. I would have preferred a viewfinder but this is not caracteristic of waterproof cameras because they are hard to use underwater, however I settled for a bright, wide and comfortable 2.7 inch LCD screen. Looks were a secondary aspect but important nevertheless, I wanted something I liked though I had no preset design in mind; this I love!

I have taken underwater shots of my grandkids in the pool which came out fabulous and we have had no issues. It takes a good quality video and its pretty user friendly in terms of its menu system. After reading previous reviews, we decided not to open the camera to ul the pics until we were sure it was completely dry. It doesn't have a great battery life but for our purposes we are very pleased.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "I use it every day", "Author": "inspector", "ReviewID": "R28F17UOW68AG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do home inspections and use the camera 5-6 days a week and take about 50-100 pictures a day. I needed a camera lens that does not pop out when focusing because I carry the camera around a lot. I take it in attics and crawlspaces under houses, so it can take wear.I've had it for a month or so and have been very pleased.  There aren't many cameras with a lens that doesn't pop out.  I mainly use it at the lowest or 2nd to lowest resolution for my home inspection reports.  I've also taken some videos with it.

I really liked all the features this one offered, it has many more great features that the s7 does not, unfortunately the picture quality is just not up to par. There was far too much noise and grain even in good light conditions. The s7 has much better picture quality.  Unfortunately the auto focus lag time on the s7 was terrible.  This one focused much more quickly.  Auto focus lag time is something I can work with, poor picture quality is not.

I took several photos in different light conditions and compared with another Nikon Camera coolpix camera, which I own since last 3 years.Every Feature thing in this camera is very very good.Except one thing; the Picture Quality.1. I recommend this camera if you want to view the Photo on a laptop or <=17 inch monitor.2. Picture Quality is not good. Its contains grainy picture.Step 1: Take a picture in good sun light condition.Step 2: Its looks very good on camera screenStep 3. Transfer the picture to a computer having above screen size.Step 4: Open the picture in computer to view. Adjust the picutre to fit in your scree size.Step 5: Upto this, you can view and say that picture quality is good ( still if you are experience photographer, you can feel that picture is not crystal clear)Step 6: Now comes the actual scenario.Step 7. Direct your picture browser to display the image in its real Size. You will see the grainy i.e. Picture is not clear.What does it means that even if you take a picture at 10MP and go to print for a large size, your print will either not be cyspy or even not clear, inspite the fact that you had taken the picture with 10MP.Now its you to decide weather to go or not, but keep the price in mind and then decide.I had Nikon coolpix, probably L6, which has only 5MP , but take brilliant photo.

It is just not steady when you are holding it with one hand away from your face.  When you press the button, the camera moves and you get a different shot than you were expecting.
