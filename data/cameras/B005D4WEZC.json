{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A cheap product with all that entails.", "Author": "neptho", "ReviewID": "R2J12EYJA7E0ZI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I first met the J012, the firmware and web controls were fairly lackluster and nearly unusable.  So, I found the latest released firmware for both the camera, and the web interface.  This required several resets of the unit, which is to be expected for most consumer grade devices.The firmware (17.35.2.49) and web UI (20.9.2.96) updates made it so I could use the device from a non-IE browser, without an ActiveX plugin - however, it still has issues:This device has no discernable ability to automatically change its light levels.  Do not confuse this statement with the built-in low light/infared system.  When it has a stronger light source nearby, you're going to get very, very washed out video.  So, unless it is staying in a statically-lit environment, it's very, very difficult to see - and will need to reset levels every time the system is restarted.  Getting dark?  The CCD will adapt with its' infared, but it is very grainly, even for such a lower end consumer grade product.The little stubby antenna and embedded wireless system are not very stable or strong.  With less than 500 feet distance, and minimal interference, these will stumble to keep a 10k/s MJPEG stream running.  That means you will likely intermittently lose your video stream unless you hardwire your camera with an ethernet cable.I'd strongly recommend the TrendNet TV-IP551WI instead of this product.  It is a much better system at a similar price.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thought it was a good deal.
