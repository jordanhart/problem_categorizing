{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon D3100 VS. D300 VS. D700", "Author": "Michael Allebach \"Tattooed Bride Photographer...", "ReviewID": "R33LNUMEWSVG00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the cost of this camera, I don't think you can get anything better.  The low light performance is off the charts. As a wedding photographer I regularly shoot with Nikon's high end professional equipment and I was amazed how close this camera is to a pro camera.  Now let me get specific.  In order to compare I took a look at 100% files out of each camera I own.Which camera excels Nikon D3100($Cheap) VS. D300($1600) VS. D700 ($2,700):* Lens = The D3100 is the only camera that comes with a lens at it's normal price* ISO Performance = Tie between D3100 and D700! (It could be Nikon's new processing but the JPEG looks fantastic I was shooting D3100 on 6400iso with very little noise at all)* Low Light Focusing = D700* Focus Speed = D700* External Buttons & Controls for Pros = D700* Menu Navigation = D3100* Ease of Use = D3100* Megapixel = D3100 (14.2)* Sensor size = D700 (Much more important than megapixels but I won't get into this)* Can use older lenses with functionality = D700 & D300* Video = D3100 of course! 1080P video looks amazing.* Frame Rate = D300 at 6 photos a second* Weight = D3100 (light as a feather)* Ergonomics = D700 (big enough for all my finger)Lens:The lens is a kit lens, it will work outside but not so great in low light. The Vibration Reduction will help indoors but Vibration Reduction can't stop a child or pet in motion indoors. Consider buying a 35mm 1.8dx AFS for around $200 and you will be super happy with this camera.Video:I purchased the 3100 specifically to shoot video, so I put on Nikon's brand new 85mm 1.4g Nano lens and shot video with it.  The lens costs more than double the camera but I wanted to see how the 1080P video looked.  It has the look of a cinematic movie. After the 85mm, I put on Nikon's 50 1.2 manual focus lens and was able to take very cinematic video in manual mode.  In order to make it brighter or darker you either need to use a really old lens like the 50mm 1.2 and hit the AE-L (auto exposure lock) and twist the aperture to change exposure.  Or you can hit the AE-L button when you get the exposure you like.  Its not a perfect system but it works well for me.  Inside the menu options you can change the AE-L button to hold the setting until you reset which is helpful.Jello Cam (What's not so great):This camera still suffers from the \"Jello Cam\" look in video if it is not on a tripod and you are shaky.  The video can look like jello if moved too quickly.  Use a monopod or tripod when shooting to avoid this.  I'm not sure if a faster video frame rate 60fps would help - but at 24 and 30 it can suffer badly.Conclusion:This is an amazing deal!  Unless you make most of your income from photography or have a stockpile of old lenses (this camera can only autofocus with AFS lenses) then this camera is the must have camera of the year.  If you have good composition skills and an eye for light you can take photos worthy of a magazine with this. Seriously, you won't regret buying this camera.  When you do, do yourself a favor and buy an additional Nikon AFS lens that has a maximum aperture of 2.8, 1.8 or 1.4.  These lenses will take better portraits and deal better in low light than the kit lens.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Review Written for Beginner Photographers", "Author": "jpullos", "ReviewID": "R2VISO8YQUXB6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photography teacher in NYC and online. (See my Amazon profile for my website.) I teach beginner and intermediate photography students every week. I've also been a professional photographer for the last five years with images published in The New York Times, GQ, New York Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, The New York Observer, The Village Voice and Time Out New York.(This review is for beginner photographers.)If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration.The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you.Where Nikon excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon.Where Canon excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.If you're set on Nikon, there are three cameras you should be considering and it all comes down to what your budget is:D7000 $1,400 without lensD5100 $750 without lensD3100 $600 only available with lens(current prices as of 2/19/11)Here's what you get for spending extra money (each camera compared to the one below it):D3100 vs. D5100:The D3100 is an EXCELLENT camera so if you only have $550 to spend total on camera and lens then go out and buy this camera. You won't regret it. If you're considering spending more money, here's what you'll get from the D5100 in comparison:-Better performance in low light situations.-A higher resolution screen on the back of the camera so you can see your images more clearly and make out if they actually turned out well.-An external mic jack. (If you're planning on shooting video with an external mic, you'll want the D5100 over the D3100.)-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D3100 shoots at three frames per second whereas the D5100 shoots at four frames per second.-Higher ISO options. The D5100 offers one more stop of ISO than the D3100 does. If you don't know what ISO means (or what a stop is) just know that this allows you to more easily shoot images in low-light situations.-Longer battery life. The D5100's battery will last 20% longer than the D3100The two advantages of the D3100 over the D5100 are: less expensive and less weight. Whenever a camera is less expensive, it means you'll have more in your budget for the lens. The D3100 weighs 10% lighter and is 10% smaller than the D5100.D5100 vs. D7000:The D5100 is Nikon's latest and greatest and is even newer than the D7000. Phenomenal camera! If you're stuck, though, between the D5100 and the D7000, here's what you'll get by spending more money on the D7000:-More focus points. When using auto-focus, the D7000 will have an easier time focusing on what you want it to focus on.-60% longer lasting batteries.-Faster continuous shooting. If you're often shooting sports or any fast moving subject, continuous shooting allows you to capture multiple images in a single second. The D5100 shoots at four frames per second whereas the D7000 shoots at six frames per second.-Weather sealed. This means you can shoot with the D7000 in the rain.-Two memory card slots. This is really a cool feature. The D7000 has two memory card slots which means you'll be less likely to find yourself standing in front of a gorgeous scene with no more memory left.-Faster shutter speed. The fastest shutter speed on the D5100 is 1/4000th of a second; on the D7000: 1/8000th of a second. To be honest, I can't think of any practical reason why this would benefit you unless you're planning on shooting some really bright scenes like directly into the sun.Advantages of the D5100 over the D7000:-A flip out screen (handy if you want to put your camera anywhere but at your eye level and be able to see what your camera is about to capture before you shoot it)-Smaller and lighter: The D5100 is 10% smaller and 30% lighter than the D7000. This is something to consider if you plan on carrying your camera around with you a lot.-Less expensive so you can spend more on your lens!If I can clarify any of this, please email me!-JP Pullos, photography teacher, NYC and online (see my Amazon profile for my website)", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Takes excellent pictures and gets out of the way while doing it", "Author": "Macauley86", "ReviewID": "R3NZH2Q4KNDSWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Nikon D3100 is a phenomenal deal for non professionals, the rest of us people that want to take family and travel shots. I've owned DSLRs since 2004, starting with a Nikon D70 and then moving to D40, D200 and Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black) and Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only). Those are all excellent cameras, but this Nikon D3100 is better than all of those in one crucial area, the area that matters: it takes excellent pictures without having to fiddle with the settings between shots. Yes, the other cameras are better in other respects: They have more buttons to change settings without delving into menus, they are bigger (is that a plus?), heavier (another plus?), and have better specs (1/500 flash sync speed for D70 and D40), but in the end I would have to fiddle with the settings to get the best results: change the white balance, fiddle with the ISO (my Canons would default to ISO 400 for flash shots, why? Who knows. That meant disabling auto ISO and choosing ISO settings manually), the exposure (+0.7 indoor, 0 outdoor), and so on. D200 was noisy at higher ISO, D70's pictures tended to be cool (i.e. not warm), 40D had cool custom buttons (C1, C2, C3, very cool), but I found its ergonomics worse than XSi or any Nikon; why place the on/off switch at the bottom of the body? Who knows. Fortunately, new Canons have fixed this).This D3100 also makes the D3000 and D5000 obsolete. The D3000 is slow and noisy at high ISO. The D5000 only shoots 720p (not 1080p), no autofocus in movie mode, less resolution. Old technology.What sets the D3100 apart from all the other cameras above is this: set the camera in P (program) mode, auto white balance, -0.3 exposure compensation, slow flash sync mode (for people shots), auto distortion correction on (great!), auto chromatic aberrations correction on (great!), and you are set; now you can concentrate on the only aspect of photography that matters: composition, i.e. framing your shot in the best possible way. There must be a photography mantra that says, \"thou shalt buy the D3100, and the D3100 will set you free.\" Now this is if you shot jpeg. If you shoot raw, you can then use a program like DXO, Aperture 3, or Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 to further play with the pictures. My workflow with the XSi was to shoot raw, then use DXO to batch process all the pics according to two settings: people (low contrast, no saturation added) and landscape (contrast, saturation, etc.). DXO would then batch-remove lens distortion, chromatic aberrations, vignetting, apply custom curves, change white balance when necessary, and apply its (almost magical) auto lighting settings to make the shots pop. For now DXO does not have a custom module for the D3100 (still too new of a camera), so I'm shooting jpeg for now. Once DXO adds the module for the D3100, I'll takes shots in both raw and jpeg fine and compare the jpegs straight out of the camera with the raw images processed with DXO. I'm curious to see the comparison.This is great, not only for you, but also for your non-photographer spouse; my XSi took phenomenal shots, but I had to know how to set it. Can you imagine me going to my non-photographer wife and say, \"okay, when you take indoor shots of our kids, set the camera on A mode (Canons expose for ambient light in A mode and adjust flash for fill, that's great), +0.7 exposure compensation, ISO 400 or 800, white balance on cloudy, and shoot.\" My wife was lost at \"okay.\" Sure the custom modes on the 40D would have helped, but the 40D is old technology; can it take 1080p video? I didn't think so. Plus, what lens are you going to use with the 40D? The 17-55 IS? Great lens, but who wants to spend $1,000 for a non-weather sealed 17-55 dust collector (google Canon 17-55 and dust)? Will 17-55 be enough for your telephoto shots? Your kids' baseball games? Didn't think so. What about the Canon 18-200? Sub-par quality, noisy, overpriced.Back to the D3100. Auto white balance (the second most important thing after composition) works great, even indoor (no cloudy setting necessary), the only changes are extreme situations (outdoor shade, or indoor fluorescent or tungsten lights at night, but that is true with every camera. Why that is is beyond me; can't they make smarter cameras that account for these situations as well?); movie mode is excellent; yes, the mic is mono, but that's okay for family use (and that's why you buy this camera; if you are pro, you landed on the wrong page); if you really want to push it, you can use this camera for video, your iphone/ipod touch for audio with an app like FourTrack, and then sync video and audio in post with the excellent Singular Software Dual Eyes program. Your choice. Matter is: DSLR video can look awesome if used the right way, but keep in mind its limitations: jerky camera horizontal panning will give you  the infamous jello effect (courtesy of the CMOS sensor), so pan slowly. You'll also have to play with autofocus vs manual focus settings sometimes; I've used the camera in autofocus; it has worked great so far.What lens(es) should you use with the D3100. You should sell the (excellent) 18-55 that ships with the camera. Quality is good, but not enough reach. You can sell it for $140 or so. Take the money and use it toward a more useful lens. What lens? The target market for this camera is moms and dads that want to take shots of their kids; even advanced amateurs like me don't want to travel with a camera bag full of primes and heavy zoom lenses that you have to swap every 10 minutes; this is 2010 (almost 2011), for crying out loud; choose a single zoom and enjoy life and photography; I would use the excellent but underrated Nikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, the excellent (but expensive) Nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX ED VR Nikkor Wide-Angle Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DSLR Cameras, or my choice, the jack-of-all trades, the Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S ED VR II Nikkor Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DX-Format Digital SLR Cameras. Yes, yes, if you check sites like Photozone, they will tell you that the optical quality of the 18-200 is not as good (or consistent) as the 18-105 or the 16-85, but it's good enough for moms and dads bitten by the photography bug. A great shot of your kid at 200mm is better than no shot with either of the other two lenses. The optical superiority of the 16-85 disappears at 135mm or 200mm, simply because it can't do it. The 16-85 and the 18-200 are about the same price. The 18-200 will set you free. It won't help you if your kids play baseball at night (too slow), but you'll have to live with it, unless you are willing to drop $2,000 on a Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S Nikkor Zoom Lens For Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. Sure, we'd all like a 16-300 VR VIII lens with a 20-stop VR reduction, constant 1.4 aperture, with optical perfection, weighing only 500 gr. and below $1,000, but alas our engineers are not as good as the random mutation and natural selection that gave us our eyes ;-0My settings:Display mode: detailed photo info > check RGB histogram and data > Done (why? You want to check if you are clipping the red, green, or blue channels)Transition effects: OFFSet picture control: portrait (for people shots)Landscape: for, well, landscape shots: increase sharpness to 4 (D3100 shots are unsharpened by default)Image quality: raw + jpeg fine (or jpeg fine, if you don't want to mess with raw)White balance: auto (I played with the settings to A1, A2, A3, but images were to yellowish for my taste, as if my kids had jaundice). Auto works fineAuto ISO: onMin shutter speed: 1/30 (1/15 if you have steady hands)Max ISO: I set 800, you can push to 1600 or even 3200 (your choice)Standard ISO: 100Active D-Lighting: on (it works well)Auto distortion control: on (Great)Movie settings: 1080 24p. You can also do 720 at 30p for less jerky movementsInfo display format: i prefer classic black (your choice)Auto info display: offImage comment: your choice. I have my name, copyright (haha), and phone numberBeep: off (please)AEL-AFL button: I only lock exposure, not focus.My accessories:67-to-77 ring adapter (if you have the 18-105 lens)72-to-77 ring adapter (if you have the 18-200 lens)77mm haze filter. I use the best, The B+W 77mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010 one. You don't want to use a cheap fIlter on top of a $350 or $650 lens.77mm circular polarizer fliter; again I use the best, the B + W 77mm Kaesemann Circular Polarizer Coated Glass Filter. This filter is for your travel shots. It will make blue skies bluer and will remove reflections from that gorgeous Maui ocean. This is an expensive filter at $180 or so; you don't have to get it right away, unless you are going to Maui soon.Why 77mm filters? Because you don't want to go nuts buying filters of different sizes for your lenses. If buy the 67mm filter for your 18-105 lens and later decide to upgrade your lens to the 72mm 18-200, you are screwed. It's cheaper to buy a $5 lens ring adapter to 77mm and use 77mm filters. It'll keep you sane too.Remember why you purchase this camera: you want to enjoy photography; enjoy it then.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "All good things come in small packages!  How true for Nikon D3100!", "Author": "VIPUL D KAPADIA", "ReviewID": "RQMA3E4E109LS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hurray! The long wait is over! Nikon had us wait for such a long time for its newer models (D3100 and D7000) and it was just when we started thinking if Nikon will ever have an answer, anytime soon, to Canon's T2i, 7D and 60D) they released these two wonderful cameras - D3100 and D7000. Let's focus on D3100, shall we?So I finally had a chance to get hold of this D-SLR at Best Buy today. I am not a pro by any means but I have used many different D-SLRs including Canon (40D, T2i, XSi) and Nikon (D90, D5000). When I picked-up the camera for the first time, my initial reaction was, \"whoa - this is so small and light weight\"! It wasn't that I wasn't aware of the specs - I knew them beforehand but I was still blown away by how small and light it felt when I held it in my hands. Then, I thought, the grip would not be very comfortable but I was wrong as holding and operating the camera is just fine - thanks to Nikon's well-thought-out design and grip. For the size and feel, it's very similar to D3000 but has more goodies from the higher versions. So from an initial wow factor, I quickly moved on to focusing on features and capabilities.I have just started using this camera so more update will follow but in the meantime my initial assessment of this camera is - I am impressed! It is one heck of a camera which can certainly compete against the best in its class (Canon T1i, T2i, Nikon D5000). Check out detailed reviews at dpreview (.com) and cameralabs (.com) - they should be added soon if not already there.I love this camera because it:+ has enough mega pixels for my needs (14.2).+ captures crystal clear images (thanks to EXPEED2 processor & the CMOS sensor, the sensor is slightly smaller than the one used in D7000).+ offers 1080p (HD) recording, AF subject tracking is awesome (10 min max is fine with me; it records outstanding videos even in low light and to me that's big).+ offers ISO from 100-3200 (D90 starts at 200), it can go higher but I really don't think why I would need anything above that.+ is small & light weight yet has good grip, easy to carry around in hands or neck.+ supports SDXC cards on top of SD and SDHC - now that's nice.+ (25-Sep-2010): has buttons that are well organized especially the video recording mode with a lever so you cannot mistakenly activate recording. That video recording lever once unlocked, gets locked in 30 seconds if you do not record and the countdown begins as soon as you unlock the lever. Also you can record video while you're in any dial (imaging) mode (Auto, P, A, S, M, and so on) where as in Canon T2i, etc. you have to move the camera dial to movie mode. So this is a great convenience - you can jump between taking pictures and recording videos with a simple unlocking of the lever. Additionally, you can be in a preferred dial (imaging) mode (Auto, P, A, S, M, and so on) and change the release mode to Single, Continuous, Self-timer or Quiet mode (this is located right underneath the main dial) - another great convenient feature.+ (04-Oct-2010): In-body photo and movie retouch menu.  This is great as we don't need any special software to apply certain touches.  I love it.Could have been even better if:- it had the bracketing option (not too much to expect at this price point level but oh well I don't use that much but for some people this could be a big plus).- grid lines were available (I miss them in both in live view and in the view finder).- Active D Lighting was not limited to just ON or OFF (either you have it or not at all, instead of low, medium, high, etc.). Don't get me wrong the ON just worked fine (better than Canon T2i) but I can't compare with all other modes.Recommendations (optional accessories):* In my personal order of importance - your preference may differ. *1. Nikon UC-E4 USB Cable - not included. (~$6)2. UV filter - a must for protecting your lens against accidental damage. (~10$)3. Carrying case is a must to protect your investment.  There are many cases to choose from and it's up to you to decide but I suggest getting something like Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW (all weather proof carrying case) so if it rains, you can pull out the weather guard and cover it up. ($90)4. Additional rechargeable Lithium Ion EN-EL14 battery so you never run out the juice when you're traveling and do not want to miss capturing a moment for good.  (~$35)5. SB-600 Speedlight.  Those who have used speed lights would know what difference it can make to an image with adjustments you can make to light for an image. (~$225)6. 18-55 VR lens has its limitations so if you have extra $$$s, buy body only (if that even is an option) and get yourself a 18-105 VR lens. But at that point, you may want to consider D90 which still is a good camera and offers many more controls. (~$325 to $350)Overall:I give this camera 5 Stars because it takes excellent pictures in almost all conditions (bright or low-light) and that is exactly what I wanted this camera to do for me. Period.I must commend Nikon for not getting into the mega pixel race (read marketing). They instead kept the photographer in mind and focused on delivering greater picture quality.

Douglas", "ReviewID": "R2OVLWD6PF15U6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently updated my DSLR collection to the Nikon D3100 from the Nikon D70. There are good reviews out there that you should check out. However, I would like to share some of my first impressions.Pro:-Better image quality and lower noise at high ISO with the D3100-MUCH MUCH lighter, which will be nice when traveling-Larger LCD screen-11 focus points, including 3D focus which tracks the motion of the subject or camera.-1080p Video-14 megapixels-2nd Generation DSLR-Quiet, quiet, quietCons:-No bracketing option. Not a huge deal since I only bracket once a year-Cannot use my old 50mm 1.8 lens. I knew this before purchasing the camera.-As of 10/1/2010, Camera RAW for the D3100 is not supported in Photoshop or Lightroom. Need to shoot .jpg + RAW or use Nikon Capture NX2 for RAW files. That should be updated soon, so not a big deal.-Can hear the lens focusing when recording video.-No depth of field preview.-Can't use wireless remoteI'm an amateur photographer and this camera meets my needs. I love the fact that it's small and light, with great quality images. If I were a serious photographer and had more money to spare, I would wait and check out the D7000, which appears to have phenomenal specs. I'm happy with my purchase and I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "D3100 with one year update", "Author": "Dan Aurel Cristescu", "ReviewID": "RGCWKM1U9CODQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For people looking for new DSLR camera, stop, this is it. It has none of the D3000 drawbacks: Fast buffer, never overloaded. When intentionally overloaded by myself on continous shots, it will clear the buffer very fast(ADL on if you're wondering). Image sensitivity at high ISO is great acording to random reviwes, but I'm still waiting a prof test. But think about it, on Auto ISO the range goes to 3200 - WOW, and I can't see any noise. You can shoot everything with it, but you need a flash - SB 400 will do.Cool stuf:You can take photos from the liveview LCD screen. I shot a few movies and seem great, in focus most of the time. I don't care much about video, I have a video camera HD.You can still set AUTO ISO from the menu and set minimum shutter speed. Downside is you cannot override the AUTO ISO in any mode including Manual. You have to change it back to off from menu and than loose time figuring out which is the best ISO/aperture/shutter speed.For shortcomings, I have to look hard but here they are:(BTW I've been using it daily for 1 week)1. LCD sceen has a lower resolution and one cannot see if the foto taken is slightly out of focus - bummer, but they have to save some features for the D5100.2. No bracketing - who brackets anymore? 3 pics of each just to be 100% sure seems a waste of memory card and time (deleting the other2. We are talking about exposure bracketing, not focus bracketing BTW.)3. ADL only on or off - lol, if you really are worried about small shadows and highlits you can always add more ADL from the retouch menu in the camera, after you take the photo. Or on photoshop or iPhoto etc. On is plenty for the prosumer ;)4. Easy to get image out of focus: one can change the focus point from the screen by pressing the arrows from the OK ring. You use the OK ring a lot and if the LCD screen has returned to ready to shoot position and you press the ring one more time(goof) the image now focuses to the right/left/up/down depending on what you pressed. Combined with a low resolution LCD in the hands of a beginer = out of focus images. Just pay attention.I'm still waiting for standard high ISO tests to confirm my love for this camera. Best camera for travelers, no questions. If you want more get ready to bend your neck hauling close to 2 lbs of gear. Not me. BTW buy the 35mm 1.8 lens for low light/no flash IT BLOWS YOUR MIND.*Update 1 year later:I downgraded the rating from 5 to 3 stars. I have beed using my camera for one year now and I wanted to sell it.1. Unknown to us initially there is an problem with the sensor's software: it overexposes the pictures frecvently on auto ISO, especially in difficult light situations with high contrast. Nikon's response was that it is not an error but rather they changed the algorithm which calculates exposure on purpose. They wanted a good camera for low light. What happens in practice is that on Auto ISO (which most people use) the camera will push the ISO very high even in bright sun (will do 400-1600 ISO !!). Huge issue - burnt highlights - no way to recover it (maybe bracketing is missed after all:  Worse off, the problem is the same with the D7100 and to a lesser degree D5100 (acording to reviews). NIKON, NIKON...Why did you change the algorithm????????? Updates to original camera software do not fix the problem - it is not considered a problem by Nikon. My next camera will be a Cannon T2i or whatever will be available from that series. It is more expensive but now it's worth it given this exposure issue. The only solution I found,a compromise, is to limit the range of auto ISO from 100 to say 200 or 400. This pretty much makes high ISOs useless and guess what ISOs your photo's will have? The max ISO you set.2. The LCD is moderately scratched and blurry from whear which adding to the low resolution - yep, hard to see if picture is in focus. I did not overuse the camera or abuse it. I am an amateur photographer and I wear it on my side (over shouder) or across - so there is allways rubbing with the clothes. And I'm not using the standard Nikon strap (which is too short for comfort and slides off your shouder) rather the smaller UP strap (which is great).I didn't want to write the upadate initailly but I felt it is my responsability not to mislead but inform everyone about what I know (which is not much).

Could you pay more to get a \"better\" camera with \"more features\"?  Absolutely.  But why?  Would you use those features?  I looked long and hard at several in my research before buying - the models I considered were the Canon T2i, Canon 60D, the Nikon D90, and of course, the Nikon D3100.  In the end, I decided the extra features on those other cameras were features that I likely wouldn't use.  I'm interested mainly in taking lots of pictures while traveling -- pictures of clouds, landscapes, maybe some street photography.  I wanted a smaller, lighter DSLR with good battery life and great image quality.  The D3100 delivers on all accounts.So what do the cameras in the next price-tier have that the D3100 doesn't?  A lot of stuff that most people looking in this price range won't be concerned with.  Here's a list of the \"missing\" things and/or \"problems\" with the D3100 as I found while researching my purchase:1) Most online reviews and forums mention a problem with AutoISO and the built-in flash.  When using the built-in flash in full auto, AutoISO jumps straight to the maximum ISO value, which I believe is defaulted to ISO-3200. Nikon says this is intended to get a better exposed background, fine with me.  Personally, I think that ISO-3200 images out of this camera are very useable unless you're pixel peeping.  If you just want to blow up an indoor portrait to an 8x10 (or even larger, I don't know!), you won't have a problem. Don't worry about it!2)  You can frequently hear the lens auto-focusing in your videos.  Ok, you got me.  If you're in a silent environment, yes, you will hear the autofocus motor, but if you're recording kids laughing and having a good time at the local indoor waterpark or at a parade or something, it's not loud enough where it would be a bother.  If it is an annoyance, you can still shoot video with manual focus.3) No external mic input.  The D3100 is sufficient for getting a clip when you want it, you're not going to have movie quality sound. Who carries an external mic with them on vacation?  If you're buying a DSLR specifically for video capabilities, you probably should be considering a dedicated camcorder anyway.  For my purposes, there's nothing wrong with mono sound.4) Lack of bracketing -- too much to explain in a review. Google it and see if you would ever use it.  I can see why it would be useful, but I doubt it'd be useful for on-the-go photography.5) Manual settings buried in menus instead of having dedicated buttons -- Most people at the entry-level probably aren't shooting full manual.  The D3100 features several \"scene\" modes that you can use, otherwise there's always aperture or shutter priority, or even full auto. Depending on which priority you're in, the scroll wheel on the back will adjust the aperture or shutter speed. If you shoot full manual all the time, you may want dedicated buttons, meaning you should look elsewhere.  If you're not in full manual, I can't see this being a problem.6) Lack of built-in flash commander mode -- you can't trigger an off camera flash using your built-in flash. Some DSLR's have built-in flashes with this capability, the D3100 does not.  For travel photography, this isn't an issue. For most at-home photography, this isn't an issue. It could be for macro photography depending how close to your subject you are, or if you have a full studio with multiple flashes setup in your basement. If you decide at a later point you want this capability, some external flashes such as the Nikon SB-700 can function as a commander.  Otherwise, you can use whatever external flash you wish in conjunction with the SC-28 or SC-29 cord inthe D3100's hotshoe.7)  Perhaps the biggest potential problem with the D3100 is the lack of a built in focusing motor.  This means the D3100 will not autofocus with plain AF lenses (manual still works though).  Any lenses with the AF-S designation will auto-focus just fine.  This can be costly though - on some of the higher-end lenses, the difference can be $600 or more between the AF and AF-S version of the same lens.  Again, this comes down to \"what will you use it for?\"  For this, I go back here:  If this is a problem, you shouldn't be looking at an entry level DSLR anyway.Nikon ships the D3100 with the 18-55mm AF-S VR lens, offers a very affordable 55-200mm AF-S VR telephoto, and my personal favorite, the 35mm f/1.8 AF-S lens.  The 55-200 can be had for under $100 if you catch a sale or rebate, and the 35mm can be had for under $200.  These three lenses will cover most of the needs for entry-level photographers, and all three of them auto-focus on the D3100.  By the time we as amateur photographers outgrow this setup, we will know specifically what focal lengths we primarily use in order to make a more educated purchase for the expensive lenses later on.  And I'm convinced, when that time comes, you'll have your eye on the latest and greatest prosumer DSLR to go with your fancy new lens anyway.Until then, enjoy the D3100 for what it is.

I have mainly used point and shoot cameras in the past and have always had fun taking pictures.  I wanted to start digital photography as a hobby so I decided to buy a nicer camera.  After reading many reviews and comparisons I decided on this camera as it is the update to the Nikon D3000 that a friend of mine has.  They love their camera so I figured this was a good choice.  Unfortunately I have not learned enough to take many pictures off of Auto mode, so it acts like a point and shoot.  Compared to my Kodak point and shoot the pictures are great.  I love this camera as it does a good job of taking pictures and is not very heavy.  It looks like it should be, but does not feel like it is.  It appears to be a very sturdy camera.Nikon suggests certain memory cards that they certified to use with this camera.  Most of these for an 8GB card are $50 or more.  I purchased two Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC Card (TS8GSDHC10) from Amazon and so far these have been amazing.  I have the camera saving in both RAW and JPEG until I can get familiar enough to switch completely to RAW.  Saving in this format is 20MB a picture and this card has no trouble keeping up.As a first time Digital SLR buyer and user I love this camera and would highly recommend it to others.  We took about 300 pictures at a Thanksgiving get together and a few other people tried the camera out and were impressed as well.I am not a professional so please don't take my opinion as someone acting as an authority on this subject, but as a first time user I am happy and hope my review will help any other first time digital camera fans out there.

I write for magazines and have to include both product and outdoors photos with my articles.Plus: The D3100 is easier to use on a tripod than the D70 because all the info is displayed on the rear LCD, not on the top of the camera where I can't see it when the tripod is set high. The light weight and small size are major plus factors for the way I work. Controls are very easy to use and quit intuitive. The NEF and fine JPG combo is nice. I suppose the live view is a plus for some people. Photo quality, when the settings are correct, was excellent. Much nicer than my D70 when using the same lens.Minus: No remote, no grid lines, no bracketing, no Speedlight remote command mode for my 800 flash. Auto focus did not work with my 6 year-old 70~300 non-VR lens (but it works fine with my first generation 18~200 VR).BIG minus: Nikon has a firmware problem. If I am in Program mode and if the ISO Auto to \"On\", in dim light conditions it uses high ISO whether or not the flash is used. The auto ISO setting does not recognize the flash. Ken Rockwell pointed this out. You have to manually set the ISO when you use flash. If you use the built-in flash for fill-flash, this ISO thing will be a real issue, just as it is when the flash is your mains source of light.I don't care about the video capabilities, but the auto focus certainly does mess up the video's audio.In all, I think it's a good camera with that one serious ISO/flash flaw.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "My portability philosophy gets upgraded with better quality pics", "Author": "V.

That's why for the last years I just kept ultracompact digicams with me that worked (and still work) fine fine. Recently I got some money from a gift, and decided to buy the new Nikon D3100 for taking better portraits of people in my life... to take quality pictures of what I'm used to do with my small digicams, in situations when I can comfortably carry the DSLR without worrying about the bulk. Basically, I bought this camera to use it exclusively with one or 2 prime lens I'll be buying in the near future.After more than 1,000 shots with this camera in the last 2 weeks, I'm very glad with the purchase. This lightweight and fast device is a joy to use! Very lightweight, and great looking design.This Nikon feels great in my hands, the build quality seems sturdy and looks kind of pro even for it's smallness compared to bigger DSLRs. I love how I can set the func button to control ISO or other stuff like White Balance.The lens included with the camera is very very sharp, so far I cannot complain. I'm amazed at the clean images I get with ISO 3200 indoors!! Wow, that's something that we couldn't say a few years ago with these cameras. I've already had pictures published in the newspaper set at those high Isos, and no problem... They look great!!I also love the option of setting Picture Controls and Auto ISO. I usually set my camera to Portrait or Standard plus a little bit (1) of saturation.I have already taken lots of photographs indoors without flash, portraits outside, candids indoors and outdoors, and even handed the camera to my brother (who knows nothing about operating DSLRs) for shooting parts of a concert and he got some beautiful pictures!! And that's one of my favorite things abut the camera: I can give it to other people to take pictures as a point and shoot, and they enjoy using it and taking nice photos without worrying about setting stuff.I really don't care about video capabilities, nor liveview. I rarely use them but when I have done it, I've liked what I've seen. My only complaint is the battery, as I think it drains quickly compared with other cameras in the similar category I've seen.So, for recording my life (and my family - friends - myself) in those moments I don't mind carrying something bigger than my ultracompact, the Nikon D3100 is perfect. I wouldn't bother to carry something bigger or heavier. This is the perfect balance.My next buy will be the Nikkor 35mm 1.8 lens, and the small sb400 flash, that I will use all the time instead of the kit lens. I have nothing against the kit lens, but I love primes and the idea of getting the best quality possible for the least money. Then, in a few months, I may get a prime telephoto for complimenting the 35mm in the candid stuff. And that's all I think I will ever need for the rest of my life in personal photography.I'm very very happy with my purchase, thanks Nikon!", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, BUT...", "Author": "J. Claypool \"white buffalo\"", "ReviewID": "R3SUQYBOUUFQAU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased a Nikon D3100 about a month ago and right out of the box I noticed the Auto (point and shoot) Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for.  The pictures looked dull and when I looked at the original file, I noticed it was from the amount of grain in the picture.  The grain was drowning out the details, and almost made the picture look out of focus.  It was happening whether I was indoor or outdoor, flash or no flash.  I changed the camera to P, S, A & M modes, and it took extremely sharp pictures in those modes, which is what I was expecting from the camera.  I sent that camera back and purchased a new one from Amazon.  Same problem.  Well, I have since done some research and participated in forums, and found out there is a problem with the D3100 choosing very high ISO levels in Auto Mode, no matter the setting.  This is causing the grain/dull/no detailed photos.  You would expect Auto Modes to take easy, great pictures in an entry level camera, most people coming from point and shoot cameras.  If you want sharp pictures, you have to use P, S, A or M modes with the D3100.  There, you can control the ISO manually, or use Auto ISO and choose a lower maximum ISO setting.  Apparently this is a discussed firmware issue, but Nikon claimed they hadn't heard about it when I messaged them...  Well, go take a look at the forums out there, it is an issue for those of us who expect quality shots in all modes.

Generally, review on this Camera is good. I purchased this Camera for its Full HD Video capability, Live View and SD-XC (up to 64 GB) memory card compatibility.I am not a professional photographer, but have passion to photography, So, I bought this entry level D-SLR camera for better quality image than POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.I have read lot of books on D-SLR settings like ISO, F-Number, Aperture, Exposure compensation etc, in actual shooting; I end up using AUTO mode.THE PROBLEM WITH NIKON D3100 (I use with NIKON SB-600 External Flash Unit)In AUTO mode, Nikon D3100 selects only  \"AUTO ISO SENSITIVITY\"WITH FLASH UNIT:  In indoor shooting; it selects very high ISO Sensitivity (mostly ISO 3200). So the image quality is not good.  In the same condition Nikon D60, selects ISO value of 200, whereas, Nikon D3100 selects ISO 3200. I mean, the Nikon D3100 is not considering the Flash Unit and is not adjusting the ISO accordingly.WITHOUT FLASH IN CLOUDY MORNING TIME: Even in outdoor daylight shooting, Nikon D3100 uses wide variety of ISO sensitivity (100 to 1600) whereas D60 used between ISO 100 to 400, in the same lighting condition. The image quality of the D3100 is not good in AUTO mode and it is only comparable to any POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.You can check this in dpreview site; in D3100 (in pg 14 of review) photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 3200, whereas for D60 (in pg 21 of review)photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 100. In the review they have not mentioned about this, but for curiosity, I downloaded the images and checked the EXIF information.Even the reviewer in dpreview.com has not noticed this biggest flaw!!! It's actually a casual shot with built-in flash, the end result is grainy ISO 3200 picture.Also, try with PASM mode, by setting SOME max ISO value. In flash mode with Auto ISO, it sets this MAX ISO. The only option we have with camera is setting ourselves an ISO value. D3100 selects high ISO values in AUTO ISO setting and the resulting in high grain pictures, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography.I am just back from 15 days vacation, with more than 1500 pictures taken, out of which 90% taken in AUTO mode. only 3 pictures are in ISO 100. All other in ISO 400 to 1100 in daylight, and ISO - 1100 to 3200 in flash mode.If you are owner of D3100, please check / review your own photos.Nikon D3100 has biggest flaw in Auto ISO logic, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography. Also Live View and Video is not meeting expectations. My D60 is much better than D3100. I am going to sell D3100 and retain my D60. (If Nikon can fix this in firmware, I like to retain D3100, I have written to Nikon, awaiting reply)If you want to buy an entry level D-SLR Camera to use like POINT-AND-SHOOT, Nikon D3100 is NOT the ONE.(Nikon D3100 may produce excellent images with Pro Modes like P,S,A & M, but certainly not in AUTO mode)Comments added on JAN 31 2011.I explored more on this D3100 Camera. Now I am using Aperture priority in most Outdoor situations and Changing ISO values to get desired Shutter Speed. I try to keep ISO at 100, if light is not sufficient then I Change ISO to 200 or 400+, to avoid slow shutter speed.

I would say d90 and d40 are the only two cameras comparable to this. when I received the camera,the kit lens is too tight to auto focus. I called up and asked a replacement.  Even for this, I still give it 5 stars as it is the problem with the kit lens. before the replacement, I tried it on 55-200mm vr. I found I can easily pull out super quality pictures from this camera without tweaking settings. This gives me the d40 feeling. I did not see this from other cameras that I tried, especially the canon peers. This camera will make you shoot like a pro if you get some basic knowledge on how to compose your frame. Although it is an entry level camera, it produce as good if not better pictures from its expensive brothers. Unless you have a specific goal and purpose that you need its heavy brothers d90 or d7000, you should definitely go for this, as well as 50-200mm VRlens, then you are all set. I have a gut feeling this will become another legendary entry DSLR like d40.Update (11/22/2010):Color tone: Besides the super image quality, the color tone is more on the cold side while d40 is more on the warm side.  The color is less saturated then d40 either. This is really personal taste.

I have owned a Samsung point-and-shoot for three years and have taken thousands of photos with it, and for the past few months I had been using only the limited manual mode on my camera, and wishing for a camera whose settings I could tweak more. That's when I started drooling over DSLRs.After months of reading about photography, I finally bought myself this camera. It was the best option for the price and for my experience level. It was easily one of the best purchases I have ever made. I bought a kit that also came with a 55-200mm 4-5.6 lens, a case, a tripod, an SD card, and some extra goodies.First, it takes amazing pictures.- It performs far better in low light than any point-and-shoot. With the right tools, it's usable right up to ISO 1600. Compared to my old point-and-shoot, this is a huge bonus.- It's an SLR, so you can take those pictures with shallow depth of field (blurry background).- Its pictures are sharp, clear, and beautiful. The high MP count makes details pop and cropping easy.- It's incredibly easy to use - Nikon has an amazingly well thought out body design, and within weeks I felt more at home with this camera than my old one.Second, I have to agree with the reviews that say the following.- The Live View mode is a gimmick. Don't use it if you can help it. It's clunky and slow and drains your battery. Only use it if you absolutely cannot hold the viewfinder up to your eye.- Video is high quality, but requires a lot of skilled technique to use properly - continuous autofocus does not work that well.Finally, some advice that relates to the purchase of the camera.- The lenses that associate with this camera are the kit zooms - the 18-55mm and the 55-200mm. These are good lenses, but the maximum apertures (3.5 and 4) do leave a lot to be desired in many situations. Within a few days of using the camera, I knew that a better lens would have made all the difference. SO - if you have the money, don't use the kit zooms. Sell them and buy lenses with larger maximum apertures. I don't personally own one of these, but I know from experience that taking pictures would be a lot easier with them.That's all I have to say about the camera. If you are a first time DSLR user, you can't go wrong with this camera. It fulfills all your expectations, and more. If you care at all for your photography and are considering buying an SLR, do it. You will not regret it.Some notes about techniques.- The GUIDE mode is supposed to ease transition, but I spent a long time reading about the technical aspects of photography - I rarely use anything but full Manual (M) Mode. On occasion, I'll use Program (P) if I don't have time to quickly change the aperture, ISO, and shutter speed - and of course I'll set it to Auto when placing my camera in the hands of someone who doesn't know how to change the settings - but otherwise, any of the multiple settings on the dial go quite unused. The reason being is that the light meter often over or underexposes depending on your metering mode, and unless you set an exposure bias, you sometimes won't get the picture you want.- That means, if you know how the technical aspect of photography works, use Manual Mode. Jump right in and allow yourself to match the full flexibility of the camera. If you are still learning, by all means use the many modes Nikon offers to facilitate learning - but don't forget, Manual offers the ultimate in control. You get exactly what you want.- USE RAW. I used JPEG for all the first few hundred pictures I took, and they're great. But when I switched to RAW, my jaw LITERALLY (yes, I really DO mean literally) DROPPED when I saw what I could do with RAW files. You have just as much control with your pictures as you do in Manual mode. You can make your pictures look EXACTLY how you want them to look, and more. Caveats: This requires some familiarity with image editing terms, and a program like Photoshop or Lightroom or Aperture (Mac), and there's a bit of a learning curve, and the files are really big (buy an external hard drive just for photos), but the payoffs are FAR greater. With RAW, photography just opens up from pictures to art.Summary:- Amazing pictures - beautiful in all ways- Low light performance is excellent- Easy to use, but also very flexible- Video and Live View are gimmicks or specialty tools- Included lens(es) is(are) fantastic, but better lenses will blow you away- Learn technical aspects, then use MANUAL mode- Use RAW once you feel comfortable", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great camera, except for one serious firmware issue", "Author": "Matthew Chandler", "ReviewID": "R2HTNB6HON09GR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in October and have used it a lot since then. It takes great pictures, feels good in my hand, is very easy to use, and I think overall a great value.However, it also has an extremely annoying problem that Nikon has yet to fix. This problem has been discussed in at least one other review, in Ken Rockwell's review of the camera, and in the Amazon.com customer discussions forum here: [...]While I read about this problem before purchasing the camera, I didn't know what it meant or how it would effect me. Now that I've become more proficient with the camera, it's become a real issue. The problem is, when the camera is set to use auto ISO and the flash is used in a low-light condition (in AT LEAST Program mode, and I believe in Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, and Manual modes as well), the camera uses an extremely high ISO and overexposes the picture. This means that for low light shooting in shutter priority mode, you have to choose between auto ISO and flash...a real annoyance.As I know that people get upset when a product they like is criticized, I've uploaded pictures in the \"customer images\" section to show what I'm referring to and how big an issue it is. They are the three pictures of a wreath, and an explanation follows (and is included in the comments of the pictures). And instead of a washed out picture of a wreath, imagine that it's a washed out picture of your family - a very annoying issue.These pictures are to show how the camera incorrectly uses Auto ISO when flash is used in low light settings. All three are taken in Program mode with the same ambient lighting conditions and all settings the same besides the ISO and flash settings. I recognize that they don't have much artistic value; they're just to show this issue.#1 - Flash on, manual ISO set to 100. Camera picked: SS 1/60, F2.8#2 - Auto ISO turned on - it chose SS 1/60, F6.3, and inexplicably picked an Auto ISO equal to the max allowed of 3200. Resulted in a terribly washed out picture.#3 - No flash, auto ISO still on. It chose SS 1/60, F1.8, and an ISO of 1100This shows that the auto ISO of 3200 is ridiculous (as it's much higher than the auto ISO picked with no flash). I guess just seeing picture #2 shows this as well, as it's terribly washed out.Ultimately, the camera is great in other respects, and I would rate it 5 stars if it weren't for this issue. However, this is a big issue and I have to rate it 3 stars for this reason. If Nikon updates the firmware to fix this issue, I will gladly revise my review, give the camera 5 stars, and remove the pictures showing the issue.UPDATE: I've just learned to adapt to this issue and just set ISO manually when I want to use flash in a low-light situation.

ISO is a camera's light sensitivity. the higher the number, the more sensitive the sensor is to light. but when increasing ISO you also increase noise levels in an image. noise is visible small dots on the image, it looks like grain. the ability of a camera to produce relatively noise free images at higher ISO is very important as it will allow you to shoot in lower and lower light conditions without using a flash. so as i've said, noise is very well controlled at ISO 800 and below, and acceptable at ISO 1600, unless you're going to be blowing up and printing large prints.if you can achieve adequate exposure you'll be very pleased with the image quality of the camera. the sensor delivers sharp, high contrast images. the auto focus system is very good, a hand me down from the mid level Nikon D90. in low light, low contrast conditions it can hunt for focus a bit, but that's common to all cameras. the kit lens (18-55mm f/3.5-5.6) is a decent all around starter lens for general photography. it's very capable of producing stunning images. all in all the image quality of this camera is beyond reproach. this new entry level camera is capable of images that older mid level cameras would be proud of (D90 i'm talking about you!).the camera body handles very well. it's a small and lightweight camera, the smallest dslr in Nikon's lineup. all the buttons and controls are clearly labeled, and intuitevely laid out. being an entry level camera it is somewhat lacking on controls. there is only one control wheel, which defaults to shutter speed. you have to hold the aperture button and use the wheel to adjust aperture. there is an FN (programable function button) that can be set to whatever function you'd like. i have ISO set to the FN button so i can change my iso without having to get into the on screen menu. the more expensive mid level and professional camerasa have more wheels and buttons to make on the fly adjustments as quick and easy as possible. but this is an entry level camera, so you shouldn't expect that. as is it's a very easy camera to handle. i dont have any issues with my adjustment settings. i shoot in M mode (manual control), and can easily adjust my ISO, shutter speed, and aperture on the fly with minimal fuss. and as i've gained experience shooting i can quickly and easily go into the on screen menu to adjust the more advanced features before i start my shooting. i suggest just shooting as much as possible to get used to the layout. before you know it you'll be changing settings on the fly like it's 2nd nature. when you do need to get into the onscreen menu you'll find it very intuitively laid out, and very logical to use. my first time using it i found everything i was looking for in menu without fuss. so as long as you're not expecting a professional layout, i think you'll be very happy handling the d3100.this camera does not have an internal auto focus motor, so be aware that you must use only the G series lenses (ex. Nikkor 35mm 1.8G lens). you'll see the \"G\" series marker after the max aperture on the lens description. G series lenses have an auto focus motor built into the lens itself, which allows it to auto focus on the camera bodies that lack such motor (hello d3100 and others!). you can still mount the D series lenes on the camera, but you'll have to manually focus with those lenses. i thought that was worth pointing out so you dont go buying this camera and a bunch of the D series lenses (which are cheaper). the good thing is in general the G series lenses are newer tech lenses and offer a small performance advantage over the D series (in general terms).so the camera offers great image quality, handles well, seems perfect doesn't it? yeah, but it's not. it's an entry level camera and as such omits some potentially important features. the camera doesnt offer exposure bracketing, which allows you to take a series of photos at incrimentally higher/lower exposures. for me this isn't a big deal at all. i've used a D90 and bracketing, and i found it to be of limited use for my beginner skills. the camera also does not support off camera flash via the CLS (Creative Lighting System) mode. what this means is you cannot remotely fire a speedlight flash (SB900-600) that isnt directly mounted on the camera. you'll have to go buy manual flash triggers. cheap ones can be had for under $40, but don't support iTTL (auto flash mode). the triggers that do support iTTL cost a few hundred. if you get into advanced lighting with your flash you'll want to set the light off camera to create direction to the light, to cast shadows and such. but you cant do that without cls support by the camera. so you either have to use manual triggers, or go buy a SB900 or SB700 and mount that on your camera, then buy another speedlight (SB900-600) and use that as your remote light. the SB900 and 700 can enable the cls system on the d3100, it's called commander mode. sorry if that's confusing, it's hard to explain. the bottom line is commander mode from the cls system is not supported by the d3100 unless you go out and buy an SB900 or SB700 speedlight. if you want to know more about commander mode and the cls system google it. the camera also does not support the mode Auto FP, a mode which allows for high speed sync (hss) with a flash. what this means is you're limited to 1/200 shutter speed when using flash. you cannot go faster. what does that mean? well hss is a great feature that if supported would allow you to sync your flash (not the pop up flash, but a seperate speedlight flash like the SB900 through 600) to your shutter at any speed. so you could still use your flash at the max shutter speed of the camera. this would allow you to greatly limit ambient light when out in sunlight, while still properly exposing your subject via the flash. and it's great to use to freeze motion, especially really fast moving subjects like birds/water/bugs etc. for me this was a huge ommission that i was totally unaware of when i purchsed the camera. i didnt find out till i got my new SB600 speedlight/flash. i tried to increase my shutter speed past 1/200 and it wouldnt go. after hours of reasearch i found out hss just wasnt possible on the d3100. i was really upset, i wont lie. in hindsight it's not that that big of a deal, it's just a limitation i have to be aware of. as mentioned earlier you have to use the G series lenses, which are more expensive. to me this isnt a big deal, i like the G series more than the D series anyways. the final shortcoming i'll mention is the lcd screen. at 230k dots it's a very low res screen. for comparison the D5100's screen is over 900k dots, almost 4 times the resolution. how this hurts is when you're shooting and your focus is slightly off, or the exposure is slightly off. on the lower res screen the image might seem ok, but when you get home you'll find the image isnt ok, it's a bit blurry or dark/light. this isnt a huge thing for me, more of a wish list item. great if it were better but can live with it as is. those are my major complaints, make of them what you will.all in all this is a great camera. if you're just starting out i highly recommend it. i will offer a suggestion to you, though. if you feel/think you're not going to grow and advance a lot in photography, and are just looking for a great camera that's a nice step up from a point and shoot, buy this camera, you'll love it. but...if you plan on growing your skills and becoming an advanced photographer, maybe save up more and get a mid level camera like the D7000. now why would i say that after gushing over the d3100 in my review? becuase as great as the d3100 is for a beginner, it IS a beginner camera. once you start getting into more advanced photography you're going to want some of the abilities that just aren't supported by the d3100. that's the boat i'm in. i LOVE my d3100, it's been amazing. i'm still blown away by some if the images i've been able to capture with it. but i fell in love with photography and i've started learning advanced techniques, and the d3100 isnt keeping up with me. but there usually are workarounds, so dont despair. and dont think the d3100 isnt a great camera, because it is. my last few statements were only directed to those who plan on becoming advanced photographers. for most people, especially those who will never even try to manual control the camera, the d3100 is plenty of camera for you, you won't be dissappointed.", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Beginner couldn't ask for anything more!", "Author": "J. bentz \"Chooch\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y27K1Y3KFUQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I'm a beginner with DSLR photography....or any photography for that matter.

It doesn't zoom too far though, so I bought the 55-200mm lens as well.  I'm actually kicking myself for that decision now though, as I would really have loved to try out a Prime lens (\"non zoom-able\" for you newbies like me) since they are faster and able to shoot in lower light, with larger aperture.  If you search on Flickr, you can actually filter pictures that use certain lenses, so you can get an idea of what you want.Once you get the hang of it, the camera takes such beautiful pictures, you'll start to think you are a professional.

The specifications on this camera are simply amazing and simply blow away the previous generation for features and value. Picture quality is great and low light performance at high ISOs are dramatically improved over the D50 which gives you a lot of flexibility. I found Live View to be a great addition but does take slightly longer to take a photo in this mode. Video is a great option to have but I do have to note that it is not a camcorder replacement but more of a fun way to take artsy clips. The autofocus during video works but is fairly loud and noticeable in the clips. I love the lightweight body, it feels solid and can be used one handed but I could see where people with larger hands may get frustrated with the smaller grip as my my pinky barely has any room to hang on.So the only two major cost cutting negative points which is why I would rate this as 4 stars is firstly for the below average resolution for the screen. I find myself constantly zooming in to be able to see if my photo was in focus and difficult to assess the quality of photos from a quick glance which is important in a SLR. I think the 400k display from the S90 would have been excellent and I would have traded less megapixels from the sensor to have them screen instead.

Over the past 6 months I was casually reviewing options for DSLR cameras.  I wanted the ability to take photos of fast moving objects and to generally take \"better\" photos than standard point-and-shoot cameras.  I looked at several Nikon and Canon \"entry\" DSLRs.  Specifically I looked at the Nikon D3000 and D5000 - the D3000 had poor reviews on several photography sites.  The D5000 seemed to be more than a \"starter\" camera, and more camera than I needed.  I briefly looked at the Canon, however based on previous experience I didn't care for their menu system.I've now had the D3100 for several weeks and am completely satisfied.  I took the camera on a family trip and was able to take exceptional photos essentially \"out of the box\".  For a DSLR beginner (or SLR for that matter) the guide mode is fantastic.  Guide Mode walks you through \"English\" (or your native language) menus of the type of picture you want to take.  Once in guide mode, you aren't locked into preset settings (Aperture and ISO) you can customize these further - again using language descriptions of what you want to accomplish.  This capability, combined with the scene modes (portrait, landscape, kids, etc) and full programming modes should last most beginners (like me) for quite a while.Pros:- Excellent pictures (duh)- great battery life (full day, 200+ shots)- light weight, lighter than the D5000Cons/FYI:These aren't necessarily negatives about the camera or kit, just more of general FYIs:- Short focal length lens.  The 18-55 lens is common on most kits and works fine for indoor or wide-angle shots.  However you'll quickly want to add a lens that will focus out beyond the 55mm capability.  I purchased the 55-200 Nikon VR lens and am completely satisfied.  Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Nikkor Zoom Lens- No SD card included.  I purchased the Transcend 8GB class 10 card and so far it has worked flawlessly.  Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC Card (TS8GSDHC10)- You'll need a camera bag/case.  I would recommend skipping the Nikon starter bag as it is only useful if you intend to carry your camera kit like a briefcase.  If you're going to be on the move, look into a camera backpack.  I picked up the Lowepro Fastpack 100.  It stores the camera, extra lens and still has room for several small items.  If you need to carry a tripod, you may need something bigger.Lowepro Fastpack 100 (Red)", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love this camera... a real step up from the D3000", "Author": "Joseph D. Land", "ReviewID": "R2J4YZPFC90F1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a D3000 a couple months ago and, even though it is a fine camera, I was simply not impressed with it.  I mean, it is capable of taking some mind-blowing pictures when in the right conditions but I was really disappointed with how poor it was in low light situations.So I went out and bought a D3100 this weekend (still have to sell my D3000) and literally from the very first image I noticed that the image quality was much more crisp even at a high ISO.  My D3000 could handle up to ISO 800 but after that you really began to see a whole lot of noise.  The D3100 image quality is clean up to 1600, shows little noise at 3200 and is still usable at even 6400!!  Now I don't have a problem when shooting in lower light areas and I love it.  For me, the ISO performance alone in this camera was worth the money and trouble I've had to go through to switch to this model... I can now say that I LOVE my D3100! :)The live view is actually a nice and handy feature to have if only for framing shoots in awkward positions.  I switched from a point and shoot (even then I preferred using the electronic viewfinder) so I was used to live view when I got my D3000.  Of course, the viewfinder is how you want to take all your pics but it is still very nice to have live view for framing shots while my camera is on a tripod or propped on a table.  I just frame my shot in live view and then switch back to the viewfinder and take snap it.  Also, I at first thought it was dumb of Nikon to remove the grid lines in the viewfinder (which aren't in thirds anyways, which is stupid) but I found that they actually function better in the live view anyways.  So if you are shooting landscape pics and have your camera on a tripod; pop to live view, frame your shot with the grid lines then switch back to the viewfinder to snap it.I think the video blows and I'm glad this is not why I bought this camera.  I didn't know why so many people were complaining about the focusing noise during recording until I heard it... it's atrociously loud!  I can actually see myself using manual focus because the auto is just too loud.  I was also not blown away with the video quality and the file sizes are too huge for me to warrant filling up my memory card with video clips.  Also, when I go to load the clips on my computer, the files seem like they are almost corrupted.  Once they are on my computer I can't delete or move them and when I try my computer just crashes.  It's really strange and maybe it's just my computers problem but all this means that I won't be using the video feature a lot because it's just not that great.  However, this doesn't effect my rating for this camera because.... ITS A CAMERA!!!... It is NOT meant to take good video.  Video is just a nice feature but I don't even find it that useful on this camera.  Don't judge a DSLR on the video... judge it on the PICTURE QUALITY!!The camera feel is a little nicer then the D3000 and a lot nicer then the D5000, which felt a little too bulky for me.  It is a very nice, ergonomic feel to it and, for me, that's important because I travel a lot and I want my camera to be lightweight and comfortable to hold and shoot with.At first, I thought it sucked that they got rid of the wireless remote but by getting rid of this feature, Nikon has actually given you more creative control over your camera.  Let me explain... if you have ever experimented with long exposure photography, you will know that you can produce some pretty mind-blowing pictures by shooting in low light situations with exposures rangeing from 30minutes to 5 hours.  Now, to do this you need to use a remote and set your camera to BULB MODE.  The D3000 (with the wireless remote) would only let you take a maximum exposure of 30 minutes and I always thought it was because the wireless remote times out to save battery life.  With the D3100 remote, you have no limit to how long your exposures can be!!!  This means you actually have complete control over your camera in long exposure photography and, to me, this is a HUGE BONUS.  Sure the wireless remote is nicer for snapping photos... but you still have a 10-second delay and now you have no limit to how long your exposures can be!  So, for me, this is another reason why I like my D3100 over the D3000... a wireless remote is nice but if it limits what I can do creatively then I'd rather have a cord based remote.I think the Guide Mode was a neat feature... until I used it for about five minutes.  It really isn't that helpful for someone who isn't a complete noob to photography.  I wish they could have added some more tips for the more advanced photographer because after using for a short time, I had really gotten all the help info I will ever need from it and now it's just a waste of dial space.  I get that Nikon is trying to gear their camera more towards the novice but I just think they got pretty lazy with the guide mode and could have added a lot more to it to really make it a ground breaking feature.  Ultimately, I look at the guide mode as a feature that looses it's value after a while.  The D5000 was better in that, instead of guide mode, they used that dial space to hold more scene modes which will have continual usefulness.All in all... this is a must have camera.  If you are looking for an affordable, high quality camera that you can really grow into, then look no further.  If you have a D3000 and are unhappy with it's low light performance then you will be very pleased with the vast improvements in this camera.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "The start of a beautiful relationship", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3W4L94EBDMZOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just picked up a D3100 today. This camera is really a gem, Day 1 and I'm already sure that I've made the right choice. Was looking to upgrade from my D70, another great camera by Nikon. However, experience over the past few years has seen my Canon G10 seeing more action since it offers a more lightweight and portable option for day to day shooting than the D70.Liked the D90, but that seems even bulkier and heavier than the D70. Didn't want to invest in a full-frame digital; as a \"prosumer\" who loves photography as a hobby, I pretty happy with the \"compromise\" of the smaller sensor of the DX series.Pondered the D5000, was swayed by Rockwell's review of it, but it was just a little too lite on the features I enjoyed on the D70. Looked at the promising 4/3rd cameras, but felt the G10 was just as good as many/most of them.Saw the D3100 announcement and that looked promising. Waited to see what D90 replacement would look like and felt too big and too expensive for what I was looking for. The D7000 is a marvelous looking camera on paper and I'm sure will make a lot of people happy.However seeing the feature set on the D3100, and the weight and size, was pretty convinced that it was the route to go. After getting it today, am absolutely sure about it.If you read the prior two well written reviews, you'll get a sense of the technical features of this camera. What I'd add are these features that I like:1) Overall feel: This camera fits perfectly for me, and I've got pretty big hands. Very well designed ergonomically.2) Size/weight/balance: Very lightweight body that balances with kit lens very well, and really nails to size factor for me.3) Build quality: I know I'm not going to get a battle-ready body at this price, but wasn't looking for that. For the materials used, feels very solid and high-end.4) Help system: I like the built-in help system. I doubt I'll use the guide mode, but will be useful for my wife. But you can get help in any mode, so it's a nice built in reference system.5) Well designed menu system: I love this. Compared to the D70, it's like moving out of the dark ages.6) Good button design: Not too many, and easy to get too. Laid out well, and intuitive to use.7) HD Video: Nikon throws in a HD video recorder. Happy to have that too.I really don't have any criticisms as of yet. Been happy with the test pictures so far, and really consider this camera a step up from the D70. I've no problem with the lack of bracketing, although that \"missing\" feature seems to be freaking some folks out. I do miss the wireless remote, but you can get a wired one.Note: Really wanted to get this from Amazon, but needed it soon for an upcoming trip so went the BB/10% coupon route. Not sure what happened to inventory management on the Amazon side. No worries, I'm sure Amazon will see plenty of lens orders from me soon enough. :-)Definitely check this camera out next time you see it, think you'll be impressed.

The photos are high quality and you can get professional looking photos in no time at all once you learn how to use the camera. Once you play with it (it's the only way to really learn how to use it and how to use it well!), you will love it. And it will grow on you for sure. If you are like me, you will have a hard time putting the camera down once you start taking photos and recording movies.The colors on the photos are so sharp and vivid that you will find it hard to believe you took the photos instead of a professional photographer. The VR prevents you from taking unclear photos if your hands are shaking while taking photos - great for children, elderly people or excited people, like me, sometimes :)I love the portrait mode and the fast shutter mode (for taking sports photos). The close up mode and the night mode are to die for and you will not believe how good your photos in low light will turn out! You will be impressed and your friends will be impressed.The video quality is good, but you will not be able to record long videos (like 30 minutes+). If you want this, then get a camcorder. This camera is exactly what it claims to be: a DSLR that takes sharp photos and 10 minutes(more or less) of HD video (mainly due to the way Nikon decided to save the file - \"MOV\"). 10 minutes of video is more than enough for me since I really do not plan on using this camera as a replacement for my camcorder anyway. I love the fact that, at this price range, Nikon d3100 is (as far as I know) the only DSLR camera on the market at this time that comes with auto-focus in video mode. The rest of DSLRs are missing auto-focus in movie mode and you have to focus manually. This may not be a big deal to some people, but it's important to me (especially when I have older people shooting videos). Another kudos (in my opinion) goes to Nikon for supporting both 24 and 30 frames per second at both 720p and 1080p!The camera does not come with a memory card (if shooting videos, make sure you get at least a SDHC class 6 card) and a USB cable for transferring photos or movies to your computer. You will need to buy the cable separately or get a memory card reader (not a big deal, though). I have 2 SanDisk 8GB class 10 memory cards and it works perfect for me!Another thing that you need to consider getting is a 52mm polarized filter. This will help protecting your lens and will also help with the quality of the photos since it will minimize reflection and glare (especially if you take photos or videos on the beach, in strong sun, by the ocean, etc). I got a Hoya filter set, but any polarized filter may work for you. If you are not ready to invest in a good set of filters, do yourself a favor and get the cheapest 52mm filter that you can buy in order to protect the camera lenses. It is much easier to replace a $10 filter,if scratched, instead of a few hundred dollars lens!On a side note: you may also want to be aware of the fact that not all lenses offered by Nikon are compatible with this camera. This was not a deal breaker for me, though, since the only other lens I plan on buying down the road is the 55-200mm one.All in all, this is a great camera for the price and I am sure you will be pleased with it.

Took great pictures if you knew what you were doing, but of course it was a film camera.  Then came digital cameras.  For the last 10 years, I was basically using point and shoot cameras, which were great for general landscapes.  No longer being interested in standing in darkrooms inhaling photo processing chemicals, I opted for a digital SLR where I could do any further processing on the computer.  As a birthday gift to myself, I got the Nikon D3100.  Took it out the first few days and achieved less than thrilling results; my point & shoots gave me better pictures.  So I took a look at the manual which helped only marginally.  I don't think it was orginally written in English and may have lost some in the translation.Common sense told me that Nikon couldn't have put out a $500+ camera that only takes so-so pictures.  I looked on Amazon and found 3 books written especially for this camera, and I bought one.  Nikon D3100 Digital Field Guide. Going over just the first few chapters of this book made a huge difference.  I'm now getting incredible images.  My problem was that photography had progressed immensely while I was playing around with the point & shoots.  This camera takes advantage of these new advances, plus it sounds like it's made a few advances of its own.  It's a very sophisticated camera, but it's also initially complicated, and there is a learning curve.  The book explains the camera in detail using plain English, and as a result I'm learning a lot about the camera and about digital photography in general, even though I thought I knew a lot.I am only now beginning to appreciate this camera.  It provides you with an incredible amount of control, from very subtle to blatantly obvious.  The display on the back of the camera provides technical information, easy to use menus, and allows you to zoom in on the images to make sure they are in focus and to check on exposure of details or shadows.  The 18-55mm lens included in the kit is great except that the maximum aperature opening is 3.5 (I was used to 1.8 on my old Nikon).  The auto focusing gives you many options, and when used correctly, the focusing is perfect and sharp.  As with all autofocus lenses, the manual focusing is touchy and not at all like the old manual lenses, however, I've really not had much need to focus manually, so it's not much of an issue.Although it can be used as such, it's not a point & shoot camera, and therefore it is somewhat bulky.  And unlike my old FG, it's mostly plastic.  I think that's life nowdays; plastic is king.  The neckstrap is kind of cheesy.  The camera kit comes with a battery (I might get a second in case, but I'm surprised at how long it does last), and a plug-in charger.  Included in the box is software for manipulating your pictures on the computer.  I haven't installed this yet because I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 9 (Win/Mac), although at some point I may try it just for fun.  There is also another disk which is an extended version of the printed manual; basically it suffers from the same problem as the printed one.  What doesn't come with the camera is the USB cable, which I think stinks.  Fortunately I had one from an old Palm Pilot that worked.  The camera, by the way, does include 2 ferrite cores.  I had to research what those were; they wrap around near one end of the USB cable to prevent interference when uploading your pictures.  Considering using it because without it I kept getting uploading errors.I didn't plan on writing this much, but really there is much to say about this camera.  Bottom line is that I really like it.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very good first DSLR, but could be better.", "Author": "eha1990", "ReviewID": "R400C4R3NQGBX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR, I upgraded from the Nikon N75 35mm to the D3100. The D3100 is built very well, it feels good in my hands even though it is pretty small compared to some other DSLRs on the market.  The menus are extremely easy to navigate and adjust.  The guide features are very useful and provide basic information about things.  The rear LCD display is very bright and viewable in sunlight.I've only had the camera for a few days, but I can already see some of the limitations of the camera.  There is a bug in the firmware that causes the Auto ISO to default to the highest ISO setting - Ken Rockwell pointed out this problem in his review of the product, my camera has this problem too.  I hope that Nikon will release a firmware fix to the resolve this issue.  I dislike not having a dedicated button to adjust the focal points in the viewfinder, you have to adjust the focal points in the menus on the camera.  The N75 has a separate button just for adjusting the focus points on it.  I also wish that the D3100 worked with the new SB-700 flash that is coming out, maybe this can be addressed in a future firmware update.  There are plenty of things to like about the camera, but there are things that are missing.

The Olympus E-420 or E-450, Sony A100, A200 Etc. are entry level. This camera is more mid level in my opinion, and I knew that going in. I was close to buying Canon t1i or t2i and decided on this. I also purchased Nikkor 35mm DX f1.8 lens, and it has not came off camera since I put it on. I tested the kit lens and put it up. The camera really shines with this lens. Low light no flash shots are great with this lens. The video is great, but I really think 1080p is over hyped. 720p is fine and a lot easier to deal with if you want to put on disc. The camera does not bracket and it should at this price. I use a work around for this, just hold steady and shoot in burst mode and then I use Photomatix Pro 4 to change exposure for my HDR shots. But still it is a hassle. D3100 takes very good pictures. I like the 14 megapixels because I crop alot of my images and that is where more megapixels matter to me. My last camera was a panasonic dmc-g10 and it suffered when cropping compared to this one. My advice if you are a first timer is go to Snapsort.com and really compare various models. This camera stacks up very well compared to pricier models. I do strongly feel this model is more than entry level and could be more than a new comer can use.

I've compared Canon EOS t2i with Nikon D3100, and finally I picked D3100. I am very happy about the decision.I will make a brief of my own experience of this camera to DSLR beginners:Pros:1. Light weight, great body design. Even with my bigger hands I can handle the camera with comfortability.2. Easy to operate. The buttons are spread evenly on left side and right side so you can use them with both hands quickly. For Canon t2i, you do most things with your right thumb that slows you down a little bit.3. Takes good quality of videos.4. Very fast auto focus on shooting.Cons:1. No wireless remote.2. Low resolution of LCD screen. It only has 230,000 pixels (Canon t2i has 1.02 million pixels). Sometimes when you're viewing playback you may need to zoom in to check the sharpness of the picture or do it with your computer monitor.3. The lens makes noises when you're recording videos using the continuous auto focus function, and sometimes it's not very accurate. If you buy this camera and this is your concern, you can simply use manual focus which is not difficult.4. Battery life is not too great. I need to charge it everyday. To be safe, consider to buy an extra Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Nikon D3100 SLR and P7000 Digital Cameras.Overall, this is an incredible camera. You will not regret it.In addition, if you'd love to take beautiful portraits for your beloved ones, I'd highly recommend you to also get a Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. It can be used to take short range portraits, close-ups, and indoors where the light is insufficient.

After a few months of reading up on various cameras and asking people for advice, I settled on the D3100 and it finally arrived last week, almost a month after ordering it. After using it over the last week, including an entire day of shooting, here are a few impressions of the camera (without delving into too much technical detail for which I refer readers to [...]Pros* Good image quality - the 14.2 megapixels allow you to make large prints of shots without sacrificing quality* Fantastic high ISO performance - even at ISO 3200 or Hi1 and Hi2, the camera performs well under low light without excessive noise or grain problems. (For example, this camera shoots better at ISO 1600 than a D70 does at the same ISO. Whereas the D3100's pictures had almost no noise, the D70's pictures were quite grainy).* Light, small and very comfortable to shoot with - all my friends who have DSLRs that picked up this camera exclaimed \"Wow this thing is SO ridiculously light\"* Buttons and menu layout is intuitive and allows for quick changes while shooting* Guide mode - for those who want to try new things with various types of photography the camera has built in tutorials that help get a user started* 1080p video - enough said!* A variety of preset shooting modes for quick shotsCons* No bracketing - makes taking HDR shots a little more inconvenient but doing it manually is of course still possible (and relatively easy)* Continuous autofocus during video is loud - an easy workaround is to focus manually* No external mic input* Cannot use a wireless remoteThe 18-55mm VR lens that comes with the camera is a great all purpose lens to start photographing with and can take very good shots in a wide range of scenarios, performing decently well in low light scenarios too. Coupled with the camera, this camera is an ideal way to enter the world of DSLRs. For those who are relatively new, the preset modes and the Guide mode are useful in understanding the different settings used in night, landscape, portrait etc photography. However, it also caters to the more advanced user with the A, S, P and M modes that allow for finer control and even complete manual control. Consequently, this camera offers amazing value for money since as an entry-level DSLR it offers an amazing set of features (which are comparable to D5000 or even the new D7000) for a very competitive price. Thus, this is a great camera for people thinking of graduating from a point-and-shoot to a DSLR.While the cons for this camera could be significant for certain people (i.e. if you are really into HDR photography or want to shoot a lot of videos with an external mic), they are generally ones that you can live with, maybe even not noticing it. Nonetheless, the Nikon D3100 is a fantastically versatile camera, especially for people new to the DSLR world, in a amazingly comfortable and light form factor.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "A budget DSLR that won't break the bank!!!!", "Author": "Anthony D. Parker", "ReviewID": "R2RSU2JP0RHUXT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've recently purchased the Nikon D3100 bundle at Best Buy for $550+ tax.  My bundle included the camera, an 18-55 mm lens & a  55-200 mm lens, an 8 GB SD card, a Nikon lithium-ion battery & charger, camera strap, camera bag, and instructional video.  I'm upgrading from a point & shoot to a DSLR and I knew that this camera was the one I wanted.  It's surprisingly lightweight and easy to use, plus this is a camera I can learn and grow with.  I'm looking forward to taking a class in digital photography sometime in early 2014 and I saw this camera as a very good investment.  As I usually do with new cameras, I took it to my local zoo to \"field-test\" it and I must say that it passed with flying colors.  I've only just scratched the surface and I look forward to using more of the D3100's capabilities in the near future.  I'll likely purchase other accessories such as a camera remote, polarizing lenses, and a tripod in the near future.  Although I have yet to use the video capabilities, it's nice to know that they're there.For anyone who wants to know if the D3100 shoots in RAW, I'm happy to say that it does.  It's called NEF and this is a standalone option as well as an option +JPEG.  Personally, I'm content to shoot in JPEG for now.  I recently showed my camera to one of my Graphic Art instructors and she was so impressed with it that she's considering purchasing one.  I told her that for the value, she could go for the bundle or the two-lens package.  The D3100 gives more bang for the buck and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from a point & shoot and not \"break the bank\".  Whether you can only afford the basic camera with the 18-55 mm lens, the double lens deal, or the bundle, the D3100 is a bargain.  Plus, you can always add more accessories and you don't need a degree to learn how to use the camera.  Yes, there are more powerful cameras that have more features and are more expensive, but it's up to each person to decide how much they're able and willing to spend.  I had the option to purchase either the D3100 or the Canon Rebel T3; it was the bundle that sold me on the D3100.This is a camera that I can see myself using for many years.

I used a memory card we already had and played around with the camera to get a feel for it.  I realized right away that I needed a better/longer lens for long distance sports shots, a bigger memory card and a bag to carry it all in.

The longer lens allows us to zoom in the kids out on the playing field or up on the stage, and it works perfectly with this camera.This is a really nice mid-priced camera, and I highly recommend it.

I know the d3100 is advertised an an entry level model, but it is really much more than that.  I consider myself a somewhat advanced amateur/hobbyist photographer, not doing it for a living but more for my own amusement and entertainment.I had read all the reviews including the ones with some negative comments, but decided that the positives seemed to be much stronger.  Since I already had the three key DX lenses [ASIN:B000ZMCILW Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens], [ASIN:B000O161X0 Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens], and [ASIN:B001S2PPT0 Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens] I bought the d3100 \"body only\" through Amazon/Cameta Camera. Sale, shipment and delivery were excellent.The camera is simply wonderful, easy to set up, easy to use, and produces great pictures.  I don't use it for movies very much (I think a camcorder is better for that function), but for the kinds of still pictures that I take (portraits, landscapes, family gatherings and the like) the d3100 is superb.I use the P mode and I generally set the white balance on auto and ISO on either auto or 400.  Since I generally don't need prints at more that 8 x 10 I set picture quality at basic/medium -- this gives me much more storage space on the disc since I'm not using unnecessary pixels.  I would set higher resolutions if I want larger size prints.When using flash I like to \"bounce\" it off the ceiling whenever possible so I use the [ASIN:B000KKPN5C Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras] instead of the built-in; the SB 400 is a very capable and affordable device that is perfect for what I need a flash unit for.I took several hundred pictures over the Christmas/New Year period, including some outside in the Sunday evening blizzard, and the picture quality was outstanding -- well focused, sharp and clear.  In particular, the ones in the blizzard were great -- I adjusted the flash to various levels of brightness and was amazed at the way the falling snowflakes showed up.In summary, this is a great camera for the price, and is one that you can begin your digital experience with and then use to grow into a better photographer who will have more and more fun and pleasure with it.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bridge camera to DSLR", "Author": "C. Ng", "ReviewID": "R2MSZHVCRUUL1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon D3100 is my first DSLR. I had been using the Panasonic FZ30 (considered a bridge camera) for about 5 years prior to this purchase.I had three main reasons for making the switch:1. I've been on the market for a DSLR for a while now, but finally decided to take the SLR plunge when I learned that Nikon had come out with this particular model. I had considered getting the D3000 when it was introduced, but I really wanted live view and video.2. Taking indoor pictures with my bridge and my regular point and shoot was beginning to get frustrating. I was tired of every 4 out of 5 pictures being blurry.3. My parents wanted my FZ30.Manual Mode vs. AutomaticHaving learned how to pick shutter speed and aperture on my bridge camera, I'm mostly using manual mode on the D3100. The Panasonic had separate dials for controlling shutter speed and aperture, so it's taking some getting used to having only one dial on the D3100 (you have to hold down a separate button while turning the dial for aperture). I have played around a bit with Auto mode and it seems to have good results. It will definitely be useful whenever I have to hand the camera over to someone else. Also, the D3100 has an no-flash-auto mode, which is useful for places where you can't use the flash or if you're like me and just don't like using the flash.White BalanceMy favorite feature has to be the white balance controls. I tend to like my pictures slightly warmer or slightly cooler and the D3100 lets you alter the color settings to be pretty much whatever you would like them to be. So, I can choose Auto white balance, but tweak the settings so the pictures are on the warm/cool side. There are several preset white balances and you can alter them each individually or use the manual calibration.Lenses and FiltersThe 18-55mm lens that comes with the camera works great for my purposes. The next lens I get will definitely be getting is the 35mm AF-S DX for lower light situations. If money was no object, I would get the 12-24mm AF-S DX wide angle zoom. As far as filters go, everyone should get a good circular polarizer, especially for outdoor photography. If you've never used a polarizer before, you'll be amazed at what one can do for skies.SoftwareTo be honest I haven't bothered to try the software that came with the camera. I use Adobe Lightroom. They recently came out with RC 3.3 which supports the NEF(RAW) files from Nikon cameras. I use Photoshop too.Things that the D3100 is missing (but I am not)1. USB cable - I had one already that worked, and even if I didn't, I prefer to use a card reader.2. Bracketing - I don't use it.3. IR remote - Can have a wired remote, but I just use the timer.Things I would have liked1. Larger aperture in the lens2. LCD screen protector, or better yet, a flip out LCD screen.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good entry level DSLR.Additional Notes: I bought this camera with an Epson large format printer because there was a manufacturer's rebate from Epson.

I am by no means a \"professional photographer\".  I've had many of digital cameras over the past few years and was ready to play with the big boys.  That being said, I'll cover the basics in this review.Build Quality-------------------------The build of this camera is what you would expect with an expensive piece of tech.  When you hold it in your hands it feels very solid and does not feel like it will break if you put your hand in the wrong place.  The lens is easily attached/detached when you follow the directions in the manual.  All buttons provide plenty of feedback so you know you have pressed it or changed a setting.GUI-------------------------The screen interface is very user friendly in my opinion.  I actually was able to set up the camera and go through all the settings without even opening the manual.  Each setting is clearly described on the menu screens so that you know what you are changing.  The interface also allows for on-the-fly editing for minor enhancements such as red-eye, color adjustments, and cropping.Picture Quality-------------------------The D3100 takes beautiful pictures - even when using the basic Auto modes.  Remove the lens cover, frame picture, adjust focus, and snap photo.  The pictures are very nice!  My wife uses the auto modes, while I prefer to use the manual settings so that you can control the shutter speed, focus, etc.  It's the best of both worlds in my opinion.  Plus, the D3100 has \"live view\" where you can set the LCD to behave just like a basic digital camera where you don't have to hold it up to your eye to frame a photo.  This feature is nice for on-the-go shooting.What is Included-------------------------D3100Wall ChargerBatteryShutter cover (when no lens is attached)18mm-55mm vibration reduction [VR] AF-S lens (auto focus motor included in this lens)Lens coverNeck strap2 Ferrite Cores (needed when using 3rd party cables to transfer to computer or to TV)Rubber Eye CoverRubber Eye CapThis does NOT come with a USB cable for transferring to the computer or a A/V or HDMI cable for viewing on a TV.

I could afford the more expensive camera, but really don't like being weighed down a lot.I'm an advanced amateur photographer, so my review will be biased by that experience.What I like:1. Battery life is excellent (however the first thing I ordered was one extra battery)2. Image detail is excellent for the cost, and the kit lenses are acceptable (not GREAT, but definitely \"OK\") for amateur use.  The big issue I have with the kit lenses is that being 18-55 and 55-200, there is a lot of lens changing required.  A wider zoom covering wide to mid tele would have been more convenient.3. Ease of use - menus are decently laid out and there are buttons to take you directly to oft-used settings such as flash mode.  A single programmable function button just below the flash-up button makes it easy to access the function of your choice.  I use it to access the ISO selection.4. Focusing and exposure is good for an entry level camera, but Nikon tends to over-expose in bright outdoor conditions, so I usually set -0.3 EC.Now, the negatives:1. Video mode is problematic-  despite having 1080p, auto focusing is NOISY and SLOW, and there is no external mic jack.  A serious omission.2. Screen - resolution is so low that it's hard to judge focus.  I have to hit zoom-in a couple of times to have any hope of confirming the focus of a shot.3. Flash - the camera has no wireless capability for flash units or anything else such as wireless shutter release.  another major omission.4. Viewfinder - viewfinder magnification is pretty low so you may have a difficult time confirming focus.  The image is so small that a \"normal\" lens won't appear \"life size\" when you keep both eyes open.  \"normal\" would be roughly 32mm.  The D7100 clearly wins the viewfinder contest--it's brighter and larger.5. Don't be fooled by silent mode.  All it does is delay the mirror-down event to occur when you take your finger off of the shutter release, after you take a picture.6.  Mirror lock up - not really.  Mirror lockup ONLY works for such things as cleaning the sensor.  It doesn't work when shooting pictures.  Also, the two second delay mode doesn't swing the mirror out of the way at the beginning of the two second interval.  the mirror goes up just before the pic is taken, just like in normal modes.Conclusion:I'm happy with the camera for MOST of my uses, but then again, I knew that it being an entry level camera, I'd have to accept such limitations.  IMO, it's definitely worth the low cost.  Furthermore, I'm far happier with the camera's performance, now that I have a Nikon AF-S 35mm f1.8 lens.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon D3100 First DSLR", "Author": "glandpuck", "ReviewID": "R2T5X3WT0ZGV6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter has been using a Nikon D90 for the past 2 years and the camera has been nothing short of rock solid.  I was using a 4 year old 7MP point and shoot that became so slow I could not stand to use it anymore.  However, I also was in need of a camera to take high def video for our family use.  The D3100 fit the bill for me.  First, it was purchased from a retailer on sale at a price point I could afford with the features an amateur looks for.  The lenses on my daughter's D90 also fit this camera so that expanded the value.  I was able to get through the manuals fairly quickly and began taking photos and experimenting with the different modes.  I did not find it overwhelming for a beginner.  Now, after purchase, I found I had to purchase a memory card, so I bought a Sandisk Extreme III 30 mb/sec card (SDHC, class 10) that is rated for 1080P video that this camera shoots.  The card formatted and worked flawlessly there is a lifetime warranty on the card. I am using a 32GB card.  I downloaded the NXView2 software to my  windows 7 64 bit computer and connected to the camera without difficulty using a min-usb to usb cable that is not included (I had one laying around).  I could edit and store my photos and movies without problems in this environment.  I did find that Photoshop CS5 does not yet support the raw format of this camera, just the jpeg, so I have converted from the Nikon NX2 software.  Lastly, I purchased an inexpensive mini-hdmi to hdmi cable and plugged it into my large screen HDTV.  The 1920 x 1080P/24FPS movie played perfectly and looked like film!  Photos also displayed without problems.  We were always speaking on the video so we did not notice the lens noise mentioned by others.

I'm Chandler, fourteen, and an amateur photographer. I got this as my first camera back in January and the camera itself is FANTASTIC. I bought it used in perfectly good condition, it just needed cleaned and the buttons had a little wear. I'd like to give you some reasons to buy and not buy this camera:Pros:- Offers great image quality in a DX (APS-C) sized sensor (14.2 effective megapixels)- Small, lightweight, fits well in the hands.- Offers a guide mode to get you out of auto and on your way to manual- 1080p video at 24fps- Battery life is fantastic.Cons:- The lens is not pleasing. I would highly recommend getting the body only and getting, for starters, the Nikkor 35mm (52.5mm equivalent on DX sized sensors) f/1.8 AF-S prime lens (Doesn't zoom, but a lot better in low light, plus sharper). It is great in low light and offers much quality for $199.- Not fantastic in low light, \"usable\" images up to around ISO 1600.- Shutter buffer clogs quickly (when using 3fps burst mode)- Only 11 AF points, 1 cross-type.Overall, this camera is fantastic, especially for being two generations behind. However, what really matters most is the glass that you put in front of it. Any pro will tell you to invest in a quality lens rather than stick with the kit 18-55mm lens. Plus, if you invest now, you will be able to use that glass on any Nikon camera you buy in the future (Despite vignetting on FX (APS-H) sized sensors). Trust me, I ignored the warnings and went ahead with buying the kit lens too. I regretted it, because I always wanted more. The quality isn't great, and neither is the low-light capabilities. BUY DECENT GLASS. Spending an extra $200 on a \"decent\" lens will help you tremendously (cheaper if you go used, or buy manual focus lenses, some for under $100).Thank you for reading, and enjoy your plunge in to photography!", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great camera.", "Author": "Adam Heironimus", "ReviewID": "R20O3L0ERJ95HH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The D3100 is a very nice camera, with tons of features that point-and-shoot's and regular camcorders don't have. For its price, its one of the best DSLR bargains out there.First, picture taking ability: I really like to take pictures, and although that's not the reason that I bought the D3100, I've got to say that Nikon really did a very good job of making photography enjoyable. It has an extremely wide range of options for every aspect of shooting: The shutter speed can be adjusted from 1/4000 of a second up to 30 seconds at a time, and the ISO can be adjusted all the way from 100 to 3200. With that being said though, I haven't really adjusted too many of the features as I take pictures- the automatic settings are that good!Everything about using the D3100 feels good, from the way it fits in your hand, to the way that the shutter clicks when it goes off (I know that sounds weird, but you have to try it to know what I mean). While my last camera, a Sony Cybershot, had the same resolution (14 megapixels) as my D3100, the D3100 takes much clearer shots, since, with it's larger image sensor, it filters our much more noise than any other camera I've ever had. This means that you can zoom into the shots that you've taken almost 1500% before you begin to notice any graininess in the image. Megapixels sound cool, but once you get above 7 or 8 megapixels you're better off looking for a camera with a large image sensor or nicer lens options. The D3100 has both.As far as the cons for the picture-taking mode go, I haven't found that many yet, my only complaint being that occasionally the camera will freeze up, and it won't take a picture, but instead will just keep shifting focus back and forth between the background and foreground. That's not that big of a deal, as it's only happened to me 3 times so far, and it can be fixed by switching to a different mode on the camera and switching back, but it has been annoying when it has happened, since you either miss your shot or have your subject get restless from standing still so long. It's not that big of a deal, but, like I said earlier, no camera is perfect.I've been using for about 6 months so far, and have been very impressed with it's video. One of the main things that I like about shooting video is that it is basically the same as snapping a picture. Rather than having a dedicated video mode like many cameras, the D3100 just has a red record button on it's back, which you can push to record video in whatever mode you happen to be in, which means that it's much quicker and easier to get nice looking shots. The only annoying thing I've found with the video mode so far is that it doesn't shoot clips longer than 10 minutes, but that's rarely an issue, unless you were to record an event like a church service, concert, or wedding. For most of what I (and, I assume, most other filmmakers) do, I never need a camera to record for more than a few minutes at a time. If you really wanted to film clips longer than 10 minutes, you could install third-party software on your camera to extend recording time, but, that would void your warranty, so I wouldn't recommend it, especially since Nikon put the 10 minutes limit on the camera so that it's CCD wouldn't overheat. If you want to shoot long events, you're better off buying a dedicated camcorder. Where the D3100 really comes into its own is with shallow depth of field shots that camcorders can't do. You rarely want shallow depth of field and long clips at the same time.I'm sure that hardcore photographers and videographers would want something nicer than the D3100, but for it's price it's an amazingly capable video and still camera,  and once you buy it, you've gotten to the point where you would have to spend an extra thousand dollars or more to get any noticeable improvement in video or picture quality. You also have to think that, if today was 2004 or 2005, you couldn't even buy a camera with the capabilities of the D3100!

While I love many things about this camera, the overall number mistakes Nikon has made with this model has caused me to want to switch to Canon. My first review was scathing but I took it down. After some more experience with the camera I am back with yet another fairly scathing review. If you are an aspiring beginner taking classes this might be a great choice. The price is amazing, and once you learn the finer points of photography this camera can be used to take some amazing pictures.The primary problem with this camera is its Auto ISO sensitivity setting. Unless you turn this off two bad things happen. First your manual ISO settings are completely ignored. Second, the camera resorts to very high ISO settings when it should not. This means if you are a casual photographer who likes to use automatic or semi-automatic modes you might be unhappy with the results. I have been in several situations where ISO 100 or 200 would have been the best choice and this silly camera resorted to 800 or higher. To its credit, the camera does a decent job at these higher ISO settings, but unfortunately these are not the settings I want. I cannot trust this camera to select an appropriate ISO setting automatically.The silver lining here is the education this camera will force onto its owners. I am finding the best way to use this camera is to disable the Auto ISO sensitivity, turn the dial to \"M\" and leave it there forever. Don't look back! The resulting experience and results are quite refreshing! Using the D3100 in this completely manual fashion reminds me of using my old Pentax K1000. I'm back to the joyful routine of selecting each and every setting manually. The only problem is that I have now ruined entire photo-shoots and missed a number of shots. Sometimes one must learn the hard way but at least I wont be making those same mistakes again. The end result is that I am becoming a much better photographer.The plastic flimsy body is a downer. On my D3100 getting the battery into the camera doesn't feel quite right. The battery remains spring loaded and sticks up out of the body. One must then force the flimsy battery cover closed after inserting the battery. Inserting and removing memory cards also has a weird feel as the card seems to get stuck and requires some extra force to remove it. The D3100's buttons are so cheap feeling its as if they are going to fall right off.So, for everyone except students and professionals I would not recommend this camera, or any Nikon. Canon is effectively obliterating Nikon in just about every way. That said the underlying guts of the D3100 have merit and should be considered, especially at this low price. The low-light performance is very impressive and the 18-55 kit lens isn't bad at all. At the end of the day the D3100 can be used to take amazing photographs if the owner manually takes control. I am taking some amazing pictures with this camera but in general I am looking forward to getting rid of my lenses and this body so I can switch to Canon.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "not a better deal for entry-level DSLR", "Author": "Eggroll", "ReviewID": "R3PTN4KMA6SYT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For specifics on what this model can/can't do, read the other reviews. This is my overall opinion in comparison to other models and brands, but most importantly: value.I am an amateur, so photography is not my source of income - it is a hobby. I have been looking for an entry-level DSLR for some time now, comparing brands and doing extensive research. I have tried a few (Canon, Olympus, Pentax) and was left unsatisfied until now. The new D3100 is simply an awesome product FOR THE PRICE. It was designed to be an entry-level DSLR, and it IS. The ease of use, functionality, and design are above average for it's price range. Yes, there are areas that are not perfect, but this is NOT a professional series camera. You get what you pay for, and with this model you actually get more than what you pay for. If you want extreme precision in settings then get a pro model.Entry level means you're fairly new to DSLR, and this model allows you to learn specific \"pro\" functions to fine tune. Other brands may offer the same, but not to the extent that the D3100 does. Learning about Aperture, ISO, lighting, and so on, takes time to master and this is a perfect model to start with. If you have 4-5 thousand bucks to spend, get the D7000; if you have more to spend, then get the D3. The D3100 is 6-7 hundred bucks and a few extras like a super zoom, speedlight/diffusers, spare battery, lens filters, monopod, and a bag is really all you need. I just got all of these and have a little over a grand invested. Like I said, it's a great entry level DSLR camera for the price. If you have a lot more money to invest then by all means get a better model. I've spent countless hours researching brands/models/accessories and decided on this one, and I'm very happy with it. A few of my friends are professional photographers, each using a different brand; they all were very impressed with this model but even more so after I told them the price. A couple years down the road I'll invest the money and upgrade.

I'll aim this review towards detailing my experience with using this camera. People looking at this model are likely comparing it to the similarly priced Canon model. Both brands are quite comparable, so at this level of the market it is really a matter of personal preference as to which brand you choose - and the current deals and discounts on offer. I choose the Nikon D3100 camera with the kit 18-55mm lens over the Canon model because I got a large discount off the second lens I wanted - the 55-200mm. (I see now that Amazon sells the camera with this lens in addition to the 18-55mm as an option, but this wasn't an option back when I bought then.) I thought with these two lenses I would have an adequate kit to get started in DSLR photography, although either a 35mm or 50mm prime FX lens is next on my wishlist. (FX lenses work fine on a DX body such as the D3100, although with a 1.5x effective focal length boost so I can somewhat future proof my lens purchases in the event I eventually upgrade to a better camera body.)I bought my camera and lenses back in April 2013 and decided to use it for several months before I reviewed them. I was heading on a trip a month later that I wanted this camera to accompany me on, and also wanted time to get to grips with the step up from many years of just using point and shoots before I offered a public opinion. I had wanted a DSLR for years, but couldn't justify the cost to myself, (I have kids and feel guilty spending money on myself), and so I had already read several books that explained the science of taking photos in a fully manual mode with a DSLR but I had never so much as picked up a DSLR before buying one. From using both film camera and digital point and shoots I was already fairly experienced and proficient in the composition aspect of taking a photo as well as in using image processing software such as Lightroom, Photoshop (Elements) and Paint Shop Pro to improve my photos. Of course, with a point and shoot or a scanned film photo I was forced to edit lossy JPG files - and now with a DSLR I can process native RAW files, (.NEF format on the Nikon), and the results from this change alone are phenomenal! I was amazed by just how much detail can be found in a RAW file using Adobe Lightroom 5 from what looks like a flat white or black area in an over/under exposed area. I'll never shoot in JPEG again if I have an option to shoot in a native RAW format.When I had received the camera I read the manual from cover to cover while the battery fully charged. I then jumped in my car and headed off on a drive to somewhere fairly scenic but local(ish) to test out my new purchase. I was determined that I would rarely use the fully AUTO mode unless I wanted to take an unplanned rush shot of something I'd miss photographing otherwise.My several hours that day out taking photos was a very educational (and fun) time for me, and certainly cemented my enthusiasm to learn more about photography that I had hoped I would have when taking the jump up to a DSLR.  I toyed around taking photos of things with differing apertures in Aperture Priority mode until I was comfortable controlling the depth of field, (as best I could with the kit lens.) took photos of things both close, and the mountains far away, at varying focal lengths, confirming for myself various aspects of photography I had read so much about but hadn't been able to practice and experiment with before fully, (e.g. bringing the background scenery closer while keeping a foreground subject a constant size.) Back home that evening I went out in the back yard and mounted my new camera on an old tripod I have with the 55-200mm lens and took photos of the moon and my house in the dark until I better understood shutter speed settings and how different ISO settings affect the photos I take. Again, this was all stuff I'd read about, but never really fully had practical experience with regard to my own photographs before. My kids were also willing models so I could experiment with portraiture.photos using different settings until I achieved the effects I wanted or could achieve with just the kit lens and it's lack of a large aperture (small f-stop).Over the next few weeks before the family trip I planned to take this DSLR on with me, I picked the camera up and experimented daily. I took better photos every day and started to instinctively know what settings to use in full manual mode - my first guesses became increasingly correct, or were otherwise a pretty good starting point to fine tune when I had set the camera incorrectly for the conditions or photo I wanted.This is a tremendous camera to learn with and takes fabulous photos. My family went on the trip overseas. I took close to 3000 photos in the weeks we were traveling. Granted, I used the camera in a continuous shooting mode almost exclusively -- taking several photos of the same scene to try to guarantee a good shot - especially when photographing movement or people, so the total figure was bumped up somewhat.If I'm taking photos left, right and center, I do now cheat a little and use Aperture Priority mode quite a lot so I just control the depth of field and let the camera do most of the rest, (although I retain control of the ISO as the camera seems to do a poor job in auto mode sometimes.) If I am planning a photo that I want to be proud of, I will still switch to full manual mode for the satisfaction that I am \"making\" a photo rather than just \"taking\" a photo. Oftentimes though, when out and about, one of the semi-manual modes (Shutter Priority or Aperture Priority modes) are all that is required to get the shot wanted and are a time-saver to use. Okay, I admit it - I sometimes use Auto-mode now too...I hope others decide to take the plunge from a point-and-shoot camera to a DSLR and ignite a similar passion for photography.

I had no idea that there was a camera that existed that would allow me to take such clean, crisp photos as afforded me by the Nikon D3100.  I was torn between the Canon t3 and Nikon d3100, but decided on the D3100 because I was far more familiar with Nikon's camera reputation.  Thus it has been almost elementary in the way that I have been able to grasp the use of features and techniques.  When I say elementary, I mean ease of use.  I am in love with my camera and highly recommend it for new professional camera users.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Entry Level DSLR", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R1JZQBAMBTSBVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the D3100 about a year ago and have been extremely pleased.  Over this time, I have actually grown to appreciate this camera even more upon comparing it to other DSLRs including the newer D3200.This camera is small and light for a DSLR (17 ounces or so for the body).  Whether this is a good or not so good thing is subjective; some people prefer a larger, more solid camera especially when using heavier lenses which can cause a light body to feel unbalanced.  I personally prefer smaller/lighter cameras like many people do (ie the proliferation of mirrorless Compact system cameras).  This camera is in fact within a couple of ounces of several mirrorless compact system cameras (ie the Olympus OMD-EM5 and the Panasonic GH2) and almost the same weight with the kit lens as some 'bridge' compact cameras (ie Canon SX40HS).The LCD screen is is not as bright as some but does the job.  It is not movable (like the D5100) which may be a drawback for those who use this camera for video (which I do not).  The optical viewfinder provides a clear and good perspective for framing which has a diopler adjustment for eyeglass wearers.  The small body manages to find room for all important controls and menus.  Ther is no dedicated ISO button but the FN button can be customized (ISO is the default option).  There is no bracketing or DOF preview controls.The AutoFocus function on the Nikon D3100, like every other Nikon DSLR I have ever used, is very quick and accurate under all lighting conditions.  I do not use \"live view\" so obviously I can not comment on focusing with the LCD screen.This camera (as does the D3200 & D5100) uses the EN-EL14 battery. Only a battery actually manufactured by Nikon ($40+) and not a generic 3rd party battery will work. Consequently, having a spare battery is a bit of a luxury with this camera.Of course the most important thing is the image quality and that's where the D3100 earns its 5 stars.  Photographs are very sharp, highly detailed and richly saturated at all ISO levels through ISO 1600.  ISO 3200 is usable but clearly not as good as lower ISO photographs.  It would have been helpful if Nikon included more than one ISO stop (presently just ISO 1600) between ISO 800 & 3200 like the D80.  The low light/high ISO photographs are really amazing for such an affordable camera.  The automatic white balance is excellent in natural lighting but has a yellow bias under incandescent lighting; the 'manual preset' white balance menu option does a much better job under incandescent lighting.  Bright, contrasty outdoor shots tend to overexpose (similar to the classic D40); -3 or -7 exposure compensation is an easy fix. Dynamic Range is excellent even with the kit lens (and Active D-Lighting turned on).  I have compared several other DSLRs to this camera (even new models like the D3200 and others costing substantially more) and the image quality of this camera even at higher ISO's can not be beat.The kit lens is actually very good optically and very light (the tradeoff of plastic is of course potential durability issues). The Nikon 35mm f1.8 prime lens and/or the Nikon 18-105mm VR lens are inexpensive lens upgrades optically (espcially the prime lens optically while the 18-105mm provides twice as much telephoto zoom versatility than the kit lens) although the 18-105mm is heavier.An external flash with bounce capabilities (ie the Nikon SB-400) greatly enhances exposure and color indoors.  A bounce flash is really essential.With the introduction of the D3200, the D3100 is now priced under $500 with a lens.  This is a steal especially when compared to the inferior and heavier, more expensive competing cameras (ie the Canon T2I).", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Nakkiel", "ReviewID": "RQW7RB9P24AR5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first dSLR.

If you have the $200 get the 35mm f/1.8 lens with this, its really amazing.The camera itself is great, but my main complaint is it doesn't have a wireless remote available like the D5100 does. The D5100 also has much less grain at higher ISO (and can go higher in general), bracketing/in camera HDR, and much better movie capabilities. I would have liked the upgrade, but since I am just starting out I figured those extras probably aren't worth the cost, and went with the 35mm lens instead of better camera body.Edit: I should also note this doesn't do the greatest job focusing in low or bright light.

I've had an Olympus point and shoot camera for years and decided it was time for a change.  I looked into SLRs because I had a similar film camera a number of years ago and I liked it.  Research online at Amazon and Consumer Reports pointed to Nikon as the best choice.  I looked into various items, some more important than others, and decided the Nikon D3100 was what I was looking for.I've had this camera for about three weeks now and realize I made the right choice.  It is very easy to use.  It has interchangable lenses (though I only have the lens it came with for now), and many features to ehlp make my photos look very good.  I use the auto settings for now.  If I get familiar with the different manual settings I may venture away from auto, but for now this guides a rookie like me in the right direction.Taking pictures with this camera is a breeze.  I choose the subject, the light, the angle, and the camera does the rest.  None of my pictures are \"Life\" magazine calibre, but I don't pretend to be a professional photographer.  THis camera is what I've been looking for and for now seems to be all I need to have fun with photography.  I just returned from foggy, rainy northern Minnesota and the pictures I took onb a dreary Thursday morning look as good as the ones I took a week ago in the sunlight.  This fall I will inquire into a community education digital photography class and will look forward to what I can learn.Anyone considering the step up from point and shoot to SLR will be pleased with the Nikon D3100.

She has a great eye for photography, but was concerned about having to constantly switch lenses for a DSLR on trips, etc. We got the D3100 with the Nikon 18-200 DX VR AF-S ED II lens and a 35 mm 1.8 portrait lens and she loves it. She actually prefered the lighter body of the D3100 over the D7000, particularly when using the 35mm 1.8 portrait lens inside. While the D7000 offers the benefit of not requiring AF-S lenses, she didn't have any existing lenses, so the D3100 worked just fine. I would have liked the additional metal and weight in the D7000, but with her desire for the lighter camera body and a better fit to her hands, the D3100 has worked out better for her.

The Nikon D3100 has everything I need for work related / family / amateur photography in one very adaptable unit.  It is easy to take good photos using simple category settings for various situations.We shoot family photos indoors using the standard 18-55mm VR lens.  The camera adapts easily for video using the same lens.  The VR does an excellent job of cleaning up the shakes and vibrations.  Auto focus does a decent job keeping up with faces & motion.  It has basically eliminated carrying an additional video camera for family events.  Carry extra batteries.  The batteries have about 1/4 of the life of my D50 battery.  Video seems to eat batteries more quickly.I also use my Nikon D3100 camera for work related photography - mostly with a 55-300mm VR zoom lens.  I use it for taking photos of architectural projects, finished products, and factory applications for website and promotional purposes, as well as technical documentation.  The camera is very adaptable to light conditions and produces professional looking photos with ease.Using the zoom lens for video is an impressive option, but has some limitations.  I was able to shoot video of a children's school program on a tripod with outstanding results.  The clarity of the lens and camera's performance captured very high quality long-distance video.  The sound quality was a little weak - I could use an external microphone option if available.  The lens noise was also noticeable when using both auto-focus and VR stabilization.  I recommend using a tripod and enabling VR, but using manual focus to decrease motor noise.  It may pick up some VR noise, but the benefits outweigh the negatives.Overall, I am enjoying my new toy and think it is exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "Stacie L.

The following contains the positives and the negatives:Pros (what I love about the D3100):-The lightest in the Nikon DSLR lineup (great for my small hands unlike my old D70)-High quality photos (beginners will be impressed)-Takes decent photos in low light environment (although a small external flash, SB-400 is beneficial in very dark settings)-Guide mode for beginners (assist in the learning process of aperture, WB, etc.)-1080p HD video recording (although I have not utilize this feature, I'm sure it will come handy when needed).Cons (what I hate about the D3100):-No in body autofocus motor (which implies old Nikon lens without the focusing motor mechanism must be operated manually attached to the D3100)-The D3100 requires the AF-S lenses for focusing (these type of lenses are normally $100 - $200 more expensive compared with regular lenses)-LCD screen only offers 320,000 dots of resolution (I find myself zooming the screen all the time to ensure focus were done correctly; what a headache!)-No wireless remote option (are you kidding me? WHY Nikon?)-No auto exposure bracketing, AEB, (if you want to experiment with high dynamic range for landscape photography, this is a great feature)-Small viewfinder (sometimes difficult to take photos with such small viewfinder)VERDICT:Again, this is a great camera for beginners (perfect for family photos and travel)and most will probably give this 4 - 5 starts, but if you are looking to expand your skills, lens collection and experimenting with HDR and other types of photography beyond the D3100's capability, this camera will not meet your needs. Look to purchasing the D7000 for an additional $500 (body only) or if you have not invested too much into the Nikon system, the Canon T2i offers more features for an additional $200. Perhaps not a fair comparison to the D3100 since the T2i is geared towards intermediate users, but for only $200 you get so much more - in body autofocus motor, amazing LCD, bigger viewfinder, AEB, light and small, and also takes great photos.UPDATE:I decided to keep the D3100 because of its light body. With the money I saved, I expanded my glass collections. In the next few years, I will be purchasing a better body.

If you are a beginner, this camera is for you.  The interface is very user friendly, accentuated by the \"guide\" which walks you through different photographic techniques (e.g., blurring the motion of a flowing stream) and explains different functions (e.g., the various flash modes, focus modes, etc.).  The image quality is excellent and boasts infinitely more creative avenues than a compact can.If you are a photo-enthusiast and have been shooting for several years, you will still love this camera.  It is lightweight and great to travel with.  The camera performs very well in low-light.  With today's noise reductions softwares (e.g., Nik DFine 2.0, noise reduction within Lightroom, etc.) using high ISO's shouldn't even be a 2nd thought.  At ISO 1600 images are excellent with a little bit of noise and at about 3200 noise gets a little much.  Unless you are shooting fast-action sports, you'll find the 3 FPS burst rate to be sufficient.  In camera editing tools make it a snap to edit your photos without having to wait to get to your computer.  The only thing I miss is the ability to bracket exposures, particularly for HDR photography.  I have not used the video mode much, but did notice that you can hear the camera focusing quite clearly.  By adjusting some of the focus modes and switching to manual focus this issue goes away.  Just takes a little messing around with.For the price this is a terrific camera.  You can purchase this and still have money left over for a higher quality lens.  That said, I have been very impressed with the kit 18-55 f/3.5-5.6.  Given good light this little lens produces exceptional photos.  At f/8 and 35mm images are very sharp.  Minimal distortion at 18mm and images are a little soft at 55mm.I am rating this as 5-stars because of the value you get for the money you spend.

The last camera I bought was a Canon Powershot after my previous Canon had died.  It took horrible pictures when I complained to Canon I was told to take photography classes....it was time to look at other brands and I will never buy another Canon. This is not a technical review, rather how I feel about it.  It takes great pictures.  I love the easy settings, since I use them the most, portrait, landscape, sports and so on.  I tried them all out and the pictures came out great.  Indoors not so much even with the automatic pop up flash....but I would say that is probably user error and I need to go deeper (I bought the D3100 Dummies book to read).  I also love the in camera edit feature I just started playing with.  I took a video and it also came out nice.  It is much bigger than the Powershot, of which I liked the compact feel, but I can get over that.  Something I would suggest (a cap with a string, I can just see me loosing the cap constantly), extra battery, especially if you take it on vacation....I am looking forward to learning more about my camera, since vacation is coming up and I would love to take some awesome pictures....what happend to my old canon?

I use my point-and-shoot for snapshots, my film camera for most other stuff.  Although the p-o-s produces very good quality pictures, I have been totally frustrated by the shutter delay and lack of manual modes and decided to break down and buy a DLSR.  A few minutes in the local store fondling this and a few other cameras convinced me to go with the Nikon. I didn't know quite what to expect from an entry-level camera, and I was a bit put off by the Guide mode, that starts off asking you what you want to do and takes you to the correct mode and settings, as well as the various point-and-shoot modes I have become so familiar with.  That notwithstanding, I love the camera for it's great (to me anyway) optics, it's light weight, the placement of its controls, its acceptably quick shutter release delay and great picture quality.  The on-board picture processing capabilities are incredibly rich in features and very easy to use.  My biggest criticism is for the kit lens. It's optical quality is great, but its zoom range is limited and the small maximum aperture really limits control over depth of field. Amazon's price for the kit was lower than many other vendors prices for the body alone, so I wouldn't recommend buying the body and a different lens separately.  Too bad I can't use my film camera lenses, even in manual mode.  Also,it's going to take me a long time to get used to carrying an SLR that doesn't weigh as much as a brick or boat anchor.  Another complaint is about the built in mic and no external mic connector.

I've been using it for a few months now, my husband bought me this as an anniversary gift for me in January and I wanted to get to know this camera before reviewing it. I've been having a great time getting to know this technology which is new to me (I've only ever used a simple point & shoot before). While I'm aware that there are DSLRs out there that are several times the cost of this one, and also come with even more advanced features, I have to say this digital SLR is a fantastic starter camera for those who are wanting to get into photography - whether it's just a hobby or even professional.I was most interested as I like to take nice photos for my blogging and also practice photography techniques with my children. Although someday I hope to pick up a few more fancy lenses, this Nikon camera comes with a great starter lens which takes some excellent photographs. As with any DSLR, it does take some learning and adjusting to in order to know how to operate this camera. While it's more complicated than a simple point & shoot that just about anyone could figure out, the Nikon D3100 is one of the more manageable DSLRs for beginners. I still have  a lot to learn about this technology, but so far I've found this camera fairly easy to understand. It has a very helpful, built-in help system as well, available on any setting at the touch of a button. I'm also a fan of the easy \"trash button\" that lets me delete photos I don't want quickly and easily, as opposed to having to navigate through a menu in order to delete anything.The built-in flash is okay, but we definitely plan to buy some additional flash accessories in order to give this camera it's fullest potential. The built-in can only do so much, so definitely consider that before buying - you're probably going to want to spend the money on a nice flash as well.We've had zero complications with this camera, although we're taking our time getting to \"know\" it, and very much enjoying the process. If you're a beginner photographer, or simply wanting a really nice camera for home/personal/business photography, the Nikon D3100 comes highly recommended by this family!

I can't understand anyone giving this camera below a 4-star rating.  This is a mid-range DSLR geared towards amateur photographers who should have some knowledge about these types of cameras.  It is not difficult to learn with a little research.Pros: The picture quality is stunning for a 14mp.  There are the usual options for different quality settings, RAW images, etc.  I like the few features included to edit some of the pictures while on the camera, including fish eye lens effect and monochrome.  (If you don't have Photoshop, this is a great feature).  The 1080p video feature is pretty amazing.  I filmed a short video for work, and the quality was better than the \"professional\" they hired previously.  Large 3\" LCD screen is nice.  Uses the standard Nikon mount for additional lenses.Cons: The software included doesn't have the editing features that are on the camera itself, nor a video clipping option.  Instead, I just import via the SD card and edit them through Photoshop.  The videos are formatted into MOV files, which cannot be edited easily on a Windows PC.  I downloaded software to convert them into AVI files, however this creates a loss of some quality in the videos.  I find clipping the videos on the camera to be cumbersome.  Also, the remote shutter release (for long exposures) cannot be controlled wirelessly (like my old D50) and you must buy a separate shutter release cord.All in all, it's a great camera for an ethusiast or hobbyist.

While I think it would be nice if the computer cable was included it wasn't a factor since I just plug the SDHC card into my card reader and download my pictures, JPEG files and used Picture It to preview.The camera is so light weight, shutter speed is excellent and can rapid fire in those action shots that you want. I want to add a telephoto and a macro lens to my case and maybe a few filters but I feel that this camera will be by my side for many years. It's the kind of camera that walks you into the learning process of using a digital SLR that many getting their 1st SLR will appreciate very much as the Manual or your on screen help will show you all that is needed. I would say that for the money there is no way to go wrong with the purchase of the new Nikon D3100, simple and fast as full auto point & shoot SLRor switch to manual and start creating those special shots you did with your old 35mm film camera.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "D3100: Biggest Bang for your buck", "Author": "Girish Manghani \"GM\"", "ReviewID": "R2LY889MWY7HBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": ":About the Camera and why I think its Great:-- Relative to DSLRs, this is small and light weight but still feels solid and rugged in your hands. I disagree with the comments about the flimsy memory card cover - it is as solid as as a hinged micro door can get. The construction and design quality is way better than Canon Entry or Mid Level DSR's. Certainly better than Rebel XSi or T1i.--Picture quality is impeccable, but that's expected from a Nikon. Ease of use is what makes this camera stand out. For a beginner like me, the intuitive Menu Navigation and visual depiction of exposure functions are a big help. The guide mode is great and very handy.--The videos are good, they are not the best feature of the camera but no one expects them to be. They satisfy my video taking needs so I am happy. The other reviews have covered the pros and cons of the video mode very well.:About the Package:-- For 800 Dollars I got a great camera packaged with a great lens (18-55mm) and top it, I got the awesome 55-200mm Nikkor AF-S lens which is an awesome telephoto lens for amateurs like me. They also threw in a $10 worth UV Filter. All for 800 dollars, that's a win I'd say.  A similar package in D90 or D7000 would be twice that amount. D7000 is an awesome camera full of features that most beginners like me will take a couple of years to get to. I will spend that money when I get there.-- After 2 days of intensive use, I feel that my decision of getting the 55-200mm lens was good. For outdoor pictures, you do need that extra zoom. And for a beginner, outdoor photography is what facilitates learning.--Other Accessories I would suggest are a weatherproof camera bag - I like the Lowepro 102AW (suggested by one other reviewer), a 16 or 32 gB Class 10 SD Card (I bought transcend SDHC Class 10), a Tamrac N45 Leather Padded Strap, SB-400 flash and I am yet to narrow down on a tripod - suggestions are welcome.Overall, a D3100 along with the 2 lenses is probably the biggest bang for your buck available today in the market for beginners interested in serious photography.  I will also end up buying an SB-400 Flash and a tripod in due course of time which would then complete my kit. 2 or 3 Years with this and I believe I will be ready to graduate to a D7000 or something better that Nikon or Canon may come up with by that time.(I will update the review in a few days with more technical details as I play with more of the functions. Also, my camera doesn't have the ISO Bug that some other reviewers have mentioned.)", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great entry-level DSLR", "Author": "Micah Abbott", "ReviewID": "R1IZFJL7U9IWL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned a number of digital point and shoot cameras, I finally decided to take the plunge into the DSLR market.

Glickman", "ReviewID": "R1IGYNU177X5UK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I learned photography in the early 1970's on a 35mm Miranda Sensorex SLR.  Lost interest in the hobby for a long time, then got back into it in 2009.  Wow, have things changed!  I have been using a Panasonic LX3 since December 2009 with very good results (fast Leica glass on the LX3) and was ready to get back into an interchangeable lens camera.  After doing a lot of hands on research, I decided on the D3100.I've had mine for two weeks now and for the most part, I am impressed.  The D3100 takes excellent images on automatic with the kit lens.  Composition is much easier with a proper viewfinder and the larger sensor makes obtaining shallow depth of field simple.  My semi-pro photographer friends have all commented that my images with the D3100 are more creative, more artistic and much better than with the LX3.Personally, I can see the enhanced creativity in my D3100 images but I feel there is little difference in image quality between the two cameras.  A bit of a disappointment on that regard (I was hoping for sharper images)  but others who have viewed my images disagree with me, so maybe I am being overly critical.  One thing I have discovered is the D3100's abilities far exceed mine when I take it off automatic - in other words, there is a steep learning curve going manual on this camera.  I have a lot to learn about exposure so I feel that the D3100 will be a great tool to help me enhance my photographic skills.I am a bit disappointed in the build quality - the SD card door is flimsy and moves around a bit when closed, the lens creaks.  The all metal LX3 has much better build quality than the D3100.  To be fair, the D3100 has better build quality than the Canons I tested.The D3100 feels great in my hands and is very nice to use.  The ergonomics are perfect.  I tested the D5100 and the D90 as well as all the Canon Rebels.  Of all of them, the D3100 felt the best.I considered getting the D5100 for its better sensor and screen, but the actual real world price difference was $400  (D5100 was being sold above sticker, D3100 was sold to me with a $100 Nikon rebate and an additional 10% discount from the retailer) and that was a significant savings.The 230k screen is adequate, not great, but acceptable.Overall, I am pleased.  I am looking forward to learning how to get the most out of this camera and I definitely feel it will help me grow as a photographer.Update, 6/1/11:  After reading Bryan Peterson's \"Understanding Exposure\", I am now shooting on full manual controls with my D3100.  I set shutter speed, aperture, ISO and white balance for every shot.  I also purchased the superb Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens and a Tamron 70-300 telephoto zoom lens.  With my newly acquired knowledge about setting exposure, the images I am taking with the D3100 are excellent.  Images taken with the prime lens are tack sharp, that lens is amazing.  The Tamron set to 70 mm also takes sharp images (images taken with the Tamron at 70 mm are sharper than the kit lens and the Tamron does not get soft until 300mm).  With just a little post processing (I am using the View NX software that came with the camera), I can get the images from the kit lens to look incredible.  I am extremely satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "amazing camera but....", "Author": "Brad W.

I bought the 55-200mm lens and I'm in love with it just out standing when zoomed in to 200mm the picture is still clean. I recommend you get the 18-200mm Nikon lens from amazon yes it cost more then the camera but its worth not switching lens ever time you go indoors or out and you never know when you need a close up.  Ill see if i cant post up some pics that i have taken there not perfect but I'm learning so enjoy. also a second battier wouldn't hurt to get if your going to be out for some time. the video is pretty good the reviews you herd about it are true but youtube it your be amazed. i just cant stop using it the best camera i ever had.  Update: Ok in the pass couple months of owning my Nikon i have to say I still love it. with that being said i have took some out standing pictures with it. Even took pictures for peoples high school pics and other events. Would I recommend this product for first time dslr owners yes. What about long term dslr customers no. I have been getting into HDR photo taking and i do not like having to take three different photos of one object from low light to bright. of stationary objects are easy to do for fast moving objects i have to take in raw and fix myself. so if you are more advance in your photo taking this camera inst for you.

Instead I bought 18mm-105mm lens and thank my good judgment every time I use my camera. Lens is good enough for wide angles and perfect for portraits.

The body of the camera feels very sturdy and lightweight. The 18-55mm lens that ships with it works great for mid-range shots or even portrait shooting. If you want to take pictures of something further away, for example a bird perched on a nearby tree, I would look into purchasing the 55-300mm lens by Nikon to accompany the 18-55mm lens.The quality of the pictures taken with this camera when outdoors is phenomenal but what is just as impressive is the low light capability as well. If you are taking a picture of something relatively still indoors, even without using flash, you can produce pictures that almost appear to have been taken in full outdoor light (recommend a tripod for indoor shooting).What I have found to be the real selling point for me is not merely the image quality or the ten minute interval recording, up to 1080p, but the portability of the camera. If you are looking for a DSLR that is both high quality and great for travel, this would be the camera I would recommend.Also, if you plan on taking this camera on a trip I would purchase an extra battery: Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery for Select Nikon DSLR Cameras (Retail Package). The Nikon battery that ships with the camera lasts very long, I only advise purchasing a second as a spare so you will not have to find an outlet to charge your only battery.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "My 1st DSLR", "Author": "Esh", "ReviewID": "R420Y6CHOJPCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 1st DSLR and I couldn't be more pleased.

Folks, there's really NO comparison to those small vacation cameras.  Yes, they might be smaller and easier to use, but the capabilities are SO limited to what a true DSLR camera can offer.  The Nikon D3100 is a great buy for what you get.  Very easy to use, very intuitive layout, and relatively easy to set up and start shooting.  Add to that countless great features (live view, several in-camera effects, light weight, image quality) make the D3100 a no brainer.At the rock bottom price of under $500, you open up a whole world of photography that's not accessible if you're just using a small point and shoot camera.  I'd suggest getting a small Nikon external flash before getting an additional zoom lens.  The small flip up flash is powerful and does a good job of lighting up dark shots, but it cannot compare to the soft, natural light from a bounced dedicated flash.  I'm amazed at how great non-flash photos look - even without using a tripod.Bottom line is this: if you're ready to step up to the world of DSLRs, you can't do any better than the Nikon D3100.  I looked at the Canon T3, and it just seemed like a cheap plastic toy compared to the D3100.  I'm looking forward to years of enjoyment with my new D3100, and I have ZERO regret after buying it.

I kept weighing out the two, and the Nikon felt so much better. I was right to have made the purchase. Some call this an entry level professional camera but I wouldn't call anything that's 600plus dollars entry level. This is a mid level pro camera. You want entry level try something without lens attachments that costs half the price. The is a wonderful camera only problem is that it doesn't allow you to swap data because there is no usb cable included. I found that to be quite cheap of Nikon especially after paying so much for the camera. I solved the issue using the USB from my PS3 controller. They are the same high quality cable and it works just fine.The only problem I have is that the stock lense doesn't zoom very well. It's not good for closeup's unless you're right up on your subject. I like taking pictures of nature and one day I found this out the hard way trying to zoom in on a bird. I will probably get a better zooming lens later on once my wallet recovers from this purchase. Overall this is a fantastic camera and that's really all I can say about it is that I love it. If you do get it try to get a good bag to keep it in your camera will thank you.There are only one set of cons I have to the camera and that is adjusting the different picture mods. Auto works flawlessly just about but trying to get the same results by manually setting up shots yourself in the individual mods can be disastrous.

I own 4 of these \"kits\", basically the D3100 and the 18-55 lens.  My company does high volume photography, mostly sports, schools and events (we will photograph over 90,000 kids this year) and I thought I would give these a shot to see how they would hold up for some of my basic sports portraits shoots and I am pleasantly surprised.  Make note of the word PORTRAITS after sports, we do not use these for action.I actually compared this, side by side, shot by shot with the Canon T2i when deciding which way to go since I was going to be purchasing so many of them.  It was actually a pretty big decision since I was deciding on a Nikon camera when my personal camera is a Canon 7D.  When comparing the 2 cameras I literally set them up on tripods right next to each other, took shots in the exact same settings, conditions, etc.  First, I compared everything in Manual mode, then I let the camera do the work in Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority and full Program Mode.  Without running through every single shot I can simply say the Nikon D3100 beat the Canon t2i, much to my surprise.  This was a VERY close comparison and, in the end, the price of the Nikon helped tip the scale in that direction.Image QualityThe D3100 wins here.  How, you say, is that possible?  The Canon is 18 megapixel and the Nikon is only 14.2...true, but Nikon has a secret weapon, the 18-55 lens!  Believe it or not, the 18-55 Nikon lens, the KIT lens that comes on this camera and many others, is actually one of the sharpest images Nikon makes.  I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't taken hundreds of shots, blown them up to 100% and compared them side by side.  Now, if you are looking for something where you plan to change lenses from time to time, then the Canon is the better choice.  However, in the case of my very specific needs, where I will never need to change out the lens on this camera because it is for sports portrait shoots only, you cannot beat the D3100.  I actually chose the Canon for another area of my business out of state where I needed more durability and flexibility...more on that in another review.As with any product, it will ultimately boil down to how you plan to use it.  If you are a consumer who is just getting into Digital SLR cameras, this is a great way to start.  It is cheap and it takes great images.  It has video, which is nice, although I do not use it so I can't give an in depth review of that functionality.  Make sure that you get the kit with the 18-55 lens though, that makes a big difference in image quality.It also has a great little feature that would be really helpful to beginners trying to understand how Aperture works.  It has a little animation on the LCD screen that shows an actual camera iris opening or closing as you adjust the aperture, which is helpful for beginners trying to understand the lower number being a bigger aperture concept.So, to sum it up:PROS:Price: You can't beat it, if you watch Amazon closely you will be able to catch it in the $500 range or maybe a bit less if you are luckyImage Quality:  Really amazing image quality WITH the 18-55 lens especially.Good for Beginners:  Has some really good tutorials to help beginners understand the basics of DSLR.Great \"Auto\" settings:  Produces really nice images on many of the standard settings for Shutter and Aperture Priority and full Program.  (although I recommend to beginners to try to learn how to shoot in Manual mode at least to understand how it works and NEVER use any of the silly settings like \"Sports\" or the other ones.)CONS:Not very tough:  It feels a lot cheaper than the CanonReally small:  It looks ridiculous with an SB900 flash on it!  (This is a con for me but might be a pro for others)Overall, I definitely recommend it for a beginner or someone with a very specific professional need like I have.

I never knew a camera could walk down cement stairs like a slinky!  I have seen it and now know that we are fortunate to have such a sturdy camera.  I had the kit lens on with a cheap filter when the camera slid off the Nikon strap and took a leap down the front porch.  My jaw dropped as the rest of me froze.  I didn't want to miss and hit it, pushing it harder down the stairs..I also didn't want to nose dive into the driveway.I paused before I picked up the delicate camera, making sure everything was in one piece. I looked at it and everything so far seems functional.  Flash popped up, lens still zooms and focuses - all features are great.  The back of the body did have a tiny bite taken out of a corner, a scratch on the top of the pop-up flash, and a few knicks on the filter.  The LCD display functions properly, however it did seem to have a slight bend to the picture that is difficult to describe.  The only time I noticed it was when I powered camera on, and the pixels light a black color across the screen, while the  top, left side, and top of right side had a slight white/green/grayish wavey color. All only for a split second and only along the edge.  Within reason, this could have been there prior to \"testing\".As I mentioned, all functions seem normal.  If I do happen to notice something different I will update this review to inform.  Now for future reference, I would suggest not giving your camera a chance to see which medal it would get for tumbling.  Just make sure your strap is securely attached to your camera and also hold the camera every chance you get.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Amatuer camera!!", "Author": "D.

I am personally an amateur myself, and when I bought this camera I really appreciated the value it brought. I had been doing my research and didn't want to spend more than $750 for a body and kit lense. I was comparing the D5000 and the D3100, and the D3100 came out on top surprisingly. I really liked the D5000 though because of it's size. I have big hands and my little D3100 looks like a brownie camera in my hands. The D5000 has a bigger body and fits ergonomically better. D3100 also came out with the new \"flick switch\" function, allowing to you instantly flick a switch and it will switch over to movie mode, instead of having to change the option dial. This is great for capturing a short clip if you don't have time to look at the top of your camera to change it. My only real problem with the D3100 is the fact that it does not have a sensor built in for a wireless shutter release remote, as well as wireless flash trigger modes(you'll have to fork out another few hundred to get the camera body that has those functions).I ended up buying aftermarket wireless triggers to do the job, which work fine, but I'd rather be more compact. I mostly shoot landscape photography, but do enjoy portraiture as well. I am constantly practicing and learning new techniques.Great starting camera for me, since I'm newer to photography. I'm self-taught, and I've read up alot on how to use a DSLR properly. Note* if you learn to shoot Manual, Aperture, Shutter, or Program, I guarentee your photos will look so much better. Grasp the concepts of Aperture, Shutter times, ISO, etc. This camera can be used as \"so easy a dumb person could do it\" or you can use it to it's full potential and shoot like an amateur who wants to turn professional.I would not recommend buying this product if you have absolutely NO knowledge of all of the concepts I listed above, or if you have no desire to learn these concepts and just want to shoot Auto.

I am a bit intimidated by all the new technology and the fact that my darkroom will no longer be a closet converted to a darkroom, but is as handy as my computer.  I am also intimidated by all that I have to learn about digital photography.  I am blown away by how compact and lightweight the D3100 is, even when I have my 300mm zoom attached. Since I am quite the neophyte, I have been mostly shooting in auto mode and the picture quality is fantastic.  Gradually I will get more creative in the manual mode, as that is where the real fun is for me.  But for now, I am enjoying my reentry into the world of photography.  And my Nikon D3100 is holding my hand along the way.  What can I say, I love my camera!  I don't think you can go wrong with this camera.

I've always wanted to get into photography, but the cost of developing film with our old film SLR and the non-artistic feel of our point-and-shoot digital cameras, has kept me from pursuing it.  With some persistent prodding I convinced my wife that it was something I really wanted, so we splurged for it.  I decided to get an entry level D-SLR; the Nikon D3100 with the 18-55mm kit lens for $550 on Amazon.  The real deal was the Auto-focus 70-300mm Nikkor VR lens for $200 off when you buy any Nikon D-SLR, so it made for a good deal.  The Vibration Reduction is really amazing.  The feel of the D3100 is great for a beginner, but I can already see why it is in the \"entry level\" category.  There are these little quirks, you know.  Like, in the \"auto with no flash\" mode (which is actually really great most of the time) sometimes the camera glitches and washes out the image with extreme over-exposure.  This is only in low-light situations.  In general the camera is pretty inconsistent in low-light settings.  The auto-focus is especially finicky here, making AF near impossible, though this is most prominent with the zoom lens and may be an issue with the lens.  In the \"Live mode\" the AF is absolutely useless unless you are in full daylight.  Maybe this is an issue with the settings, but it seems pretty limited in the setting category.  But, all that said, I absolutely love this camera and it is perfect for me to experiment with and to learn the art of photography.  I am already ordering a fixed zoom in the AF-S 35mm f/1.8G as I read these are great for low light shots and would help with photos in the studio.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Merry Christmas!", "Author": "J C Miller", "ReviewID": "R23GAYZEZP9OOC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the D3100 for Christmas.

I like the ability to use filters and different lenses. It has however been a long time since I upgraded. My last camera was and still is a Minolta STSI 35mm. Still works but as Minolta doesn't make cameras and most of my scopes and binoculars are Nikon I made the switch. The D3100 is a solid camera for the average user. And while it isn't nearly as rugged as say the D7000 is still is well built. There are a lot of buttons but as time goes on I find that they are well placed. Making the step from a SLR to a DSLR did take a bit of a leap. The camera doesn't come with memory or a cord to connect it to the computer. So I purchased those right away. Also purchased a 52mm Polarized filter for it as well as a spare battery and memory. Strongly recommend the Polarized filter to those new to cameras they are well worth it. Also, dont get a cheap one you can get at Walmart or Best Buy. Also, figured out that I can save in both RAW and JPEG format at the same time which is useful, some documentation said that you could only do one or the other but not both so I was happy to find out you could do both. RAW format was important to me as I wanted to be able to play around with the pics later like I did with my 35mm negatives before. Do wish that they made a grip for this camera.

There are so many things I  can do with it.I took a camera class so that I could use it like it's really made for - on the modes where it's not just a giant, expensive point and shoot camera.  Turns out, the smaller lens (18-55mm) is pretty junky and I need to replace it (that's why I gave 4 stars). My teacher says this is pretty typical in these kinds of sets. But it just isn't fast enough inside. Outside, pictures are great. Inside, even with proper settings, it just doesn't work - weird coloring, blurry, etc. If it's on the automatic setting, it does ok inside. Outside: amazingly gorgeous photos.The battery lasts a good long time. I can easily get through a soccer game (so over an hour and I take a ton of pictures). It recharges quickly too.Overall great camera.

This camera comes very highly recommended so my expectations were set very high. This camera far exceeds my expectations!!! I upgraded from a 10 year old Pentax film SLR and it was a very easy adjustment. The features of this camera are very intuitive to use. I took this camera to Ireland on vacation a week or so after I got it, and was able to adjust all the manual settings I had gotten used to on my old camera without too much effort. I also find the automatic settings (auto, shutter, aperture, no-flash) to take very well balanced photos.I was concerned that I would regret not getting the VR lenses for image stability and to reduce blurring, however, I haven't had issues with this at all. I have gotten used to stabilizing though with my old camera, so maybe this is why I haven't noticed it.My only criticism of this package would be that there is no overlap in the lens' zoom. While traveling I found I had to switch lenses a lot because I would need to zoom in a little bit more than the 18-55mm, so would switch the lens out to 55-200mm, then 10 minutes later couldn't zoom out as far as I needed and would have to switch back to the 18-55mm.

This fantastic combination makes it one of the top cameras on the market for families and home users that want a little professional touch to their photography and want to capture those special moments in style.The Nikon D3100 has a 3 inch monitor, one of the largest monitors for a camera of this size. The camera itself is just 7 inches wide and weighs about a pound, making it easy to carry and handle with one hand and also makes it great to take with you on your vacations. The monitor offers a full color display and One-Touch Live View shooting. This process makes the delay that other digital cameras experience during start-up almost non-existent.While, in the past, many professional photographers have been averse to the inclusion of video capture from such a fine camera, you\u2019ll be delighted to hear that the Nikon D3100 has a 1080 pixel HD video component as the quality doesn\u2019t take second place to functionality. You can actually get great quality video capture something that is becoming more and more popular for all-in-one devices.Nikon\u2019s commitment to quality shows in this latest addition to the Nikon line. The D3100 has a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery and a charger that both come with the camera. It features an 8GB micro SDHC card with SD adapter to store those photos before you have them printed or print them yourself. Optical image stabilization and a scene recognition system make taking pictures easier than ever. The camera senses movement from your hands and helps to stabilize pictures so that you do not end up with blurred photos. It also optimizes focus, exposure and shutter speed to help you get the best pictures possible without you having to take a photography class. Instructions are included with the camera in both booklet and CD format. The camera contains its own Guide Mode that helps you with step-by-step instructions to compliment the lighting conditions and format of the photos that you are taking at any particular moment.The Nikon D3100 has 6 automatic scene exposure settings if you don\u2019t want to take the time to adjust settings manually. It also includes facial detection technology that makes it easy to get your focus on the right subject in your photos. Facial detection keeps the camera from missing those all-important close-ups because of interference from objects around the subject of your photo. The Nikon D3100 also comes with a high sensitivity flash with a lens that\u2019s included in Nikon\u2019s one-year warranty. The flash allows for great pictures, no matter what the quality of lighting.

At this point (June 2012) the D3100 and its 14-megapixel image sensor is slowly being phased out by the D3200 which has a 24-megapixel sensor. Honestly, although the D3200 is sure to be a great seller, most people will be MORE than fine with the D3100 and can save some cash buy buying this camera.I've made excellent, tack sharp prints as large as 16x20 inches from heavily cropped images from the D3100, so 14 megapixels is way more than most people need. Not only that, but if you get the D3200 you will need to buy larger capacity SD cards (or more of them) because the 24-megapixel images take up more storage space on the memory cards. The 18-55mm kit lens is a great starter lens and good for a wide range of uses from landscapes to portraits. Nikon's Vibration Reduction (VR) technology in the lens allows you to take sharp photos at lower shutter speeds without a tripod.I worked for years as a wedding and portrait photographer and I use the D3100 with the Nikon 35mm 1.8G, 50mm 1.8G and 85mm 1.8G as my compact DSLR kit. This allows me to to shoot portraits in available light and cover most portrait situations with a small camera bag. Sometimes I'll bring the 18-55mm kit lens along just to have wide angle coverage, but these smaller lenses I just mentioned are all I use with the D3100. Yes, you can use larger lenses with the D3100 but I personally don't use this camera with my larger lenses because the camera itself is so small that larger lenses make everything feel out of balance.Anyway, if you're looking for a simple compact DSLR that makes a good \"family camera\" then the D3100 is a good choice.

I choose this one because I found better reviews for the Nikon, I am sure that the T3 is an awesome camera too.Coming from P&S; cameras you will notice a very big difference in colors, in how many shots per second you can take, the built in flash quality (even thought you can't compare it to a speedlight. The guide mode is a little limited but it is like shooting with a tutorial at hand, very good for beginners. Good for low light situation (again, compared to a P&S;, not to a D7000 or D3s), good quality even at ISO3200. The lens is not that good, but not bad either, I think the body only with the 35mm 1.8G or the 50mm 1.8G is a better pack.I have not shoot that much video, but I have read that the problem is that you can hear the autofocus motor working. But if you want it to shoot video, go for the D5100 that has a mic input. It also has a better sensor, but again, if you are on a budget, the D3100 is great, you can buy better lenses later to improve even more your photos.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!!!", "Author": "Joseph T.

They make some great but expensive lenses.  However, sigma and tamron also make some good lenses.  However, remember this is not a point and shoot cmaera.  I have read several books and am taking better pictures each day.  See my two comments to \"camera loco's\" two star review.  These comments may help you begin to understand the Nikon camera system.I do get great sunset and sunrise pictures that I never could get with a point and shoot camera.  This alone is worth the price difference.  However, you must learn how to use shutter speed, Apperatur and ISO to get great pictures.  It helps that I had a film SLR over 40 years ago but I still needed some refresher on these three especially ISO.  In the old days, the film itself controlled the ISO.  You could not set it.  You bought a different film for each situation.  This also necessated use of a dark bag to change films when you needed a different ISO (film speed).  Glad those day are gone.  A dial is mush better than changing film.I suggested a book in my comments to \"camera loco\".  There is another one.  I believe it is called \"From good shots to great shots for Nikon D3100\".

I got this camera, because I'm about to have a little girl and I wanted to take better pictures than I could with my Droid. Now that I have it, and have taken some pictures, I want to take more pictures of everything. I see amazing shots all around me everyday now.It does have a little bit of a learning curve to it, if you've never used a DSLR (I think all DSLRs do though). There are only two complaints that I have. The first one is a lack of AEB (automatic exposure bracketing). I've seen some really amazing shots that are HDR (high dynamic range) images. The easiest way to do these kinds of shots is with AEB, but that option is reserved for the higher end Nikons. You can still achieve HDR shots without AEB, but you need to either use the timer to reduce shake, or a remote shutter. Which brings me to my second issue with this camera. The D3100, from my understanding, replaces the D3000. The D3000 has an infrared sensor on the front for using a wireless remote shutter. For some reason Nikon removed the sensor from the D3100. You can still purchase a corded remote, or a wireless remote that comes with a wired sensor, but it would have been nice if Nikon had made it easier to take HDR shots on this camera.

I have been learning more and more concepts of photography since I bought it. I was able to take very decent pictures from day one. There is only one thing that I don't like. The auto mode uses a very high ISO exposure; as a result, your indoor pictures will be over exposed. That can be frustrating at the beginning, but once you start to use the P mode, that should not be a concern anymore.

First off, the pros:Image quality: very good to excellent, depending on the subject, overall the photos trend toward softness, but the supplied software (more on that in a bit) takes care of that very well.The kit lens: Spectacular! You will never buy a better lens for the price, although the manual focus sucks. It is very light as well.Focusing: None in body, not a  big deal if you are just getting started in DSLR photography, but it might be a problem if you already have a bunch of older AF Nikkors laying around. One good thing is that the kit lens is very fast for the price.Build construction: Very good for the price; very light and sturdy enough to hold up for a long time under normal (non-abusive) use. The rubberized grip is in particular excellent.Manual controls: Pretty extensive, but some are a little hard to access if you have to do it fast.Supplied View NX2 software: Excellent, you can buy better and more expensive software, but why would you unless you are a full-time pro.Viewfinder: A little small, but nice and clear.LCD screen: Not bad at all except for Live View.The cons:Video: Not bad quality per se, just not great, especially the focusing and when panning.Live View: Fairly poor, very slow focus compared to when using the viewfinder, not very good good LCD screen when in Live View, and you have to take it out of Live View to make any setting adjustments. It makes a rather loud clunk when going in and out of Live View as well.Camera noise: It makes a fair amount of noise, but no worse than most DSLRs.Burst speed: Fairly slow, but no worse than any other entry-level DSLR.Summary: Overall this is an outstanding starting DSLR, as it is generally very simple to use, and has no major flaws.

At the same time, the camera is extremely versatile and easy to use, even in full manual mode.I normally shoot with manual focus and aperture preferred exposure and have been getting excellent results, even at ISO 800. Auto-focus is extremely accurate when the plane of focus is clearly defined, but I select my focus point and use the camera's electronic rangefinder. The through-the-lens viewfinder, by the way, is surprisingly bright with the f3.5-f5.6 kit lens.Maybe I was lucky and got a superior kit lens. In any case, the only reason I would have now to buy the 35mm f1.8 prime lens is the extra speed, which I don't need at this time. I used to think that I needed a full frame DSLR to get the definition and texture I expected in my large prints. Seeing samples in the online zine \"Dpreview\" convinced me to try the APS-C format, and I thank them for it.Note: I recommend a filter to protect the front element of the lens, and a lens shade to reduce glare; an older shade designed for a 24 mm lens on a 35 mm camera will work without vignetting throughout the range of the kit lens.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera", "Author": "D.

Quiet shutter. Not sure about this compared to the D5000 since I have never heard D5000's shutter sound outside the shopping mall. Based on the reviews, I think D90 is too loud so D90 is out of my consideration, furthermore D90 is a 2 yrs old model.3. Image quality. New is always better, I think so since this is not a Canon. D5000 is a 1.5 yrs old model, although it has better D-lighting control but it might be discontinued very soon.Some tips:FN - set to ISO control. Easy control your ISO speed.AF-L - set to AF lock. Just lock the AF and you can just fire without the lens to re-focus again, very fast.EV - set to -0.3EV for matrix metering, outdoor images look like always over exposed a bit.Cons:-SD card's door is a bit shaky.-The LCD screen turns on every times you change ISO speed and exposure compensation/aperture setting in M. Since I know where the buttons are, I don't want to move my eyes away from the viewfinder. A bit annoying.-Handgrip is a bit short to grasp when shooting with long lens (180mmAF etc)", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Patricia Brown", "ReviewID": "RS4613PSL1J7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my husband as a gift.

With the release of the D3100 I thought it was time to upgrade.  With film cameras, upgrading a body doesn't really mean much when it came to the quality of the picture.  It was more important to get great lenses.  With digital, it's a bit different -- a body represents the body and film.  My D70 had image processing technology from 7 years ago.  The D3100 has significantly improved the image quality and processing.  The difference in picture quality with the same set of lenses I had before are amazing.  The only drawback to the upgrade was a loss of a few features that my D70 had like bracketing (only useful for me with HDR -- so not a huge loss) and support for lenses that didn't have an autofocus motor.  However, the huge gains in image processing and ergonomic improvements were more than enough of a compromise for me.  If you want something that has those features, you might want to look at the D7000 which is basically like the D70-90 with a lot a much better image processor.

Our latest Canon P&S; is only a few years old, so I honestly didn't really think that I needed any upgrade, but after our first son was born a few months ago, we broke down and bought the D3100 because we were having so much trouble getting good, clear photos of him.The D3100 has been awesome so far.  We just had our son's baptism, and took tons of photos inside the church and restaurant afterwards (most on auto since we handed the camera off to relatives), and even on auto it was a huge difference in quality from our past indoor photos.  We've also played around with the different modes, and have already taken some cool portraits with the backgrounds softened (we've always loved that effect).  The guide mode was pretty helpful at first, and it was definitely one of the features that made us feel more comfortable upgrading to an SLR camera.  I was also surprised at how small the camera is.  I always had the impression that SLR's were pretty bulky, and we were concerned that we might not want to take this one with us travelling, but it's actually a lot smaller than I would have thought.  We've ended up taking it pretty much everywhere with us.  We've also been spoiled so much by the quality of the D3100 photos that we have absolutely no reason to take photos with our P&S; camera anymore.1080p video is also an added bonus, and one of the features that we were really interested in too with taking home videos of kids, dogs, etc.  The sound of the lens auto-focusing hasn't really been an issue for us.  Maybe there's been a lot of background noise when we've taken videos so far, but I haven't really noticed it much.

If I am taking these precious moments i'd better take the best out of it and linger in these detailed, crisp, pictures in the near future. Whilst, I was scouting I took notice of the different reviews with the different brands in DSLR's and I was down to the professional reviews of dpreview.com and from youtube test reviews.From these reviews I made a conclusion that Nikon is par excellence in this field plus the lenses they use are from Leica. Hence, my decision. When I took the basic steps in setting the unit, I was really impressed how easy it was. And the pictures was great even on basic settings. When I posted in other social networks and photo sharing websites my friends took immediate notice of it and they started asking what was I using. I told them of course about my new baby, the Nikon D3100. I dont have much technical details about this since I am a novice in this field.

Although, I have not used it a great deal yet, it is a very impressive piece of electronic equipment.My first impression, is that it is not a simple camera.  This is my first DSLR since using an FM (all manual)35mm SLR in school, about 20 years ago.  My degree was in photography and cinema, but I do not use it professionally.  So, with that said, it might make more sense to tell you I understand f-stops, shutter speed, depth of field and many more of the relevant technical issues of photography, but only using a film camera.Even with this knowledge, I have found it a challenge to understand everything this camera is capable of doing.For that reason, even though this is an entry level camera, know that it is a bit complicated to understand it's full potential of capabilities.  You will make excellent photographs using the \"auto\" settings and not understanding the rest of the camera.  If you take the time to work with the camera and use the manual as a guide, the camera will be better understood.As for what I like about the camera:  (1.)It's fast and easy to use in the auto mode.  (2.)The grip is comfortable and very functional. (3.) Color balance is good with the built in flash (not sure how itfunctions over longer distances...haven't tried it.  May need something more powerful) (4.) Light weightand not too much of a burden to carry in a backpack or arm bag. (5.) Love the burst shooting.  Three framesper second is suitable for the amateur. (6.) Battery does not fall out the bottom of the camera..it has afriction hold and will not come out easily if the access door comes open (I read this as a complaint inanother review).  (7.) An amateur will appreciate the \"dummy\" menu since photo terminology needs to bestudied to understand.As for what I dislike about the camera:  (1.) The fact that I spent a lot of money on it and have to carefulthink about how I handle it.  It is not a beat around camera.  Buy a point and shoot for snapshots if you tendto be rough on electronic equipment.  (2.)  Monitor gets dirty quick and hoping I won't scratch it from cleaning it frequently. (3.) A pretty large learning curve for understanding all of the functions....you will need to practice a lot.I will say in closing, this is a great little camera for the hobby of photography.  It is a great little camerafor professionals, I imagine, as well.  Although, not a professional quality (durability) camera, it will suitthe average person.  Be aware, it is mostly all plastic, like most cameras these days, and requires carefulhandling to avoid damage.Oh, one last thing.  Do what I did initially and buy a second battery.  They are expensive, but at least youcan charge one to have when the first one dies.  Using the flash cuts into the life of the battery.  It's not that noticeable, but it is something to think about.  I also bought a transfer cable so that I don't have toremove the card as often.  The review of different memory cards had a common thread that many are not as durable as they would like.  I figured not removing the card would help to protect it from wear and tear.Good luck with your camera.Tim, Ohio", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Missing my  D40", "Author": "David Devine", "ReviewID": "RXQ9PXU43BXN7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Compared to D40, auto iso algorithm with flash is inferior.

This may not seem all that much of a loss, but the remote feature made tripod photography (group shots where you want to be in, and, more importantly, night time shots where you don't want to touch the camera to trigger the shutter) much easier.  Sure, there's a self-timer on the D3100, but that's a Mickey Mouse and anachronistic way of firing your camera.  There's only an two and ten second selection on the timer, so you may miss the shot or not have enough time to get into the shot.Moreover, the depth of field button is gone.

It is fantastic--affordable without sacrificing crispness, effectiveness, and versatility. For someone who went from an older 35-mm Nikon to a higher end point and shoot digital camera because, well, such are the times, it's like getting your hands back on magic.  So much control, yet so many extra functions without the cost of developing film. So it pays for itself. Going digital was simply for convenience; the pictures never had the same feeling.  That's all about to change!My only negative comment is in regards to purchasing from the Amazon Warehouse.  I was aware that it was a returned item, but it was labeled, \"Like New\".  For the most part it was, but the individual components were only loosely packed inside the Nikon kit box.  Usually there is lots of styro to protect the body and the lens from banging around during transit.  This was not so, but I do not detect any damage YET.  The lens also did not have the usual cap that comes on a new lens on the end that connects to the body.  There was some dust inside but I was able to remove it, I think. We shall see. The weirdest thing is that there were some nails, maybe six or seven 3/4\" stainless steel nails, inside the compartment with the body of the camera! Huh?!  I'm still wondering about that.So, great camera, weird packaaging experience.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Entry Level Camera", "Author": "procana", "ReviewID": "R1JCM3BR3UTHKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and have been so happy with the performance.

If you're a knowledgeable enthusiast this camera are still a good choice. Excellent video quality but pity for the crappy sound quality and the noisy lens however it did not bother me as you'll going to edit the videos with sound anyway. If you want better sound you'll need a sound recorder and work them together. I have from an earlier set up 80-200 Lens and I'm just about to pick up a 50mm prime lens which are a must. We live in Florida and I haven't use much of my flash yet (SB 600) but I have it just in case. Its small size excellent battery life and simple use are makes it all the best. It's the cheapest of the Nikon lineup with 1080 video. It's certainly fools everyone just by looking at it and there is a difference between let's say D7000 or D90 my previous camera compare to the D3100 but it's less than half the price!

There are many great reviews that go into great detail of all the specs and pros and cons, and I agree with most of them, so I won't beat any dead horses.  I will add that I feel the D5100 may be worth the extra money, for the retractable/swivel display alone.  I use the view finder for 95% of my shots (it's much, much quicker and the LCD resolution is not true,) but there are times when lifting the camera over my head or for shots way down low that the swivel LCD would be perfect.  I find myself missing some priceless \"first\" moments with my daughter because of this.  Also, it would be handy at the zoo or fair for shots.

I normally would not buy a camera without handling it to see if it felt comfortable but decided to take a chance as the D3100 was so new and about the only way I could get one was through Amazon. I was not disappointed. It is lighter but feels as comfortable as the D50 even with other zoom lenses attached. I haven't taken a ton of pictures or movies yet but I will state so far I am very pleased. Navigation through the various menus is even more convenient than the D50. While I consider myself quite knowledgeable the guides are handy and for someone new to digital photography the D3100 is very user friendly and teaches you the basics. Very innovative!I highly recommend this camera. I do note that battery life is not quite as long as the D50. Movies,quite naturally, use up more battery life. Suggest one gets a spare.

Despite my reservations about battery life, this camera is good for about 5 hours of continuous random shooting with the OEM battery, and having come with a 32GB card already in it, I can get about 300 pictures before I have to recharge the battery (1.03A/hr) and still have plenty of room left over before I use up the memory. I have since bought two additional batteries and the charge time from dead to full charge is short enough where I can use another battery and the old one is recharged before the new one goes flat. As these are Lithium Ion batteries, I can also recharge a partially drained battery after a shoot and not have to worry about battery memory problems.Having the ability to work fully manual or automatic is nice as well, although frequent use of autofocus and shooting in raw .jpeg files significantly reduces the battery life and the number of shots per charge - but raw jpegs can give exceptional results. This is a trade-off that did not pertain to film cameras. Interchangeable lenses is also a big plus as I do a lot of macro-photography and, contrary to normal lenses - which have a curved depth of field - macro lenses have a depth of field that is more like two flat planes making it a lot easier to deal with depth of field issues when photographing small objects.In the past, I have owned a Hasselblad 500, Rolleiflex, Pentax Spotmatic, Canon F-1, AE-1, Olympus OM-1, OM-2 - all with multiple lenses - and a D-500 digital - and all were excellent performers. With the exception of the Olympus D-500 all were film type cameras and after every photo shoot, I would have to spend hours in the darkroom developing slides, mounting them and then have to edit them over a lightbox with a magnifier and cotton gloves and canned air. With this camera, which is fully compatible with Linux Ubuntu and GIMP Image Editor, all I had to do was buy a USB cable (Which I feel should be supplied - sheesh!), or remove the memory card and insert it into my laptop, download and edit, delete and save my images as desired. I can also delete images, from the computer, using the file management utilities inherent in Linux.Yes I would recommend this camera and vendor to others. I am getting high enough quality images for both printing and internet and other digital formats and rarely go over 8\"X10\" on prints, which have the same quality as prints from 35mm inter-negatives from Kodachrome 25 or prints from normal 35mm negatives. While the D3200 has about 4 more MB of pixels, the format of this is large enough where I generally reduce the image size to the standard formats and I can go as high as 500pixels per inch in jpeg formats so the image quality is not a factor. My shooting method has always been to shoot a larger background than I need to allow me more freedom in cropping the final photo as I can increase the pixels per inch in the process and not lose any image quality. All-in-all a 5-star performer. To quote Bogie...\"This may be the start of a beautiful friendship.\"...Two cons I should mention. The camera came to me with a lot of photos in the memory. I would think that the prior owner or the seller should have formatted the card prior to selling the camera. It only takes seconds to reformat the card. Just a heads up for anyone contemplating selling their camera and the vendor I bought this from. I really do not need, or want, someone elses work on my camera. I am also a bit miffed that this requires a plug-in remote shutter release that plugs into a port instead of the old style shutter cables. Meh... Progress marches on. Maybe the Smithsonian would be interested in my old shutter cables. But this is more of a matter of personal preference anyway - and is only a handicap when shooting wildlife where I set upon a tripod and work from a blind. The manual shutter releases do not require a battery and the cordless do - and are subject to RFI.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon D3100 14.2MP SLR Camera", "Author": "Jim Landing", "ReviewID": "R3GIMQPVV7ZMPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So much in a little package, what a great, compact Camera.

We are novice photographers but can say that so far we are both pleased with the performance. I've always leaned towards pocket point and shoots for the simple fact that I would carry them more often.  But they were always hit or miss with regards to speed, image quality, etc. and have become somewhat superfluous as cell phone cameras have gotten better.Enter the D3100No way P&S; or cell phone cameras could give us the shots we get for the D3100.  Last weekend at our 4 year old's soccer game, that became even MORE glaringly obvious.  I opted for the VR lens, but can't tell you if it makes a difference or not.  Worst case is that I spent $100 extra if we don't like the VR and turn it off.I have no other SLR to compare it to (other than a 1980s Canon A1 that I used to use) so I can't say how it stacks up against other current offerings.  All I can tell you is that if you think you want to step up to a SLR, this is a nice way to go.  The body is not huge, you get 2 lenses that should handle 95%+ of all your needs and you get speed, and quality shots that are FAR better than P&S; cameras we spent $300 on.I just got back from a trip to oregon and wished I had taken the SLR.

I purchased some additional lenses, and the entire investment was about $1000.00I was willing and ready to purchase the D5100, but upon comparison, found that the resolution in the D3100 was admirable, and perhaps better, than that of the other model. I have been extremely happy with the pictures I have taken so far, with only two complaints about the camera in general.First, the shutter is noisy. Someone had told me that before I purchased the camera, and at the time I had though, \"how noisy can a camera be?\" But now, after having shot thousands of pictures for school events and family functions with this camera, I concur. Sometimes, settings are quiet, and the photographer seeks not to disturb an audience. However, with this camera, there is no \"sneaking up\" to surprise a subject. Every photo you snap will be announced by a loud snap and clickclickclick.Finally, my larger complaint - one fact that I wish I had known before I purchased the camera - is that there is quite a delay when photographing in low light. That several second delay may mean the difference between a great shot and a grand blur of an image. I photograph my toddler grandchildren frequently - many low-light attempted shots of their high-energy antics has resulted in really bad pictures. Granted, a flash would correct the problem, but sometimes the light of a flash kills the artistic aspect of a photo.There are some great features which offset my two complaints. Primarily, the automatic settings of this camera will make any newbee photographer more self-confident. Another \"plus\" is that this camera has an automatic lense-cleaning feature -- the lense shimmies at a high-frequency rate to loosen dust. It's pretty cool, especially considering I often forget to check the lense for dust. Finally, there are cross-hairs in the view-finder which allow one to point the camera and know exactly how the subject will appear in the image. I understand that not all cameras have this ability.Would I purchase this camera again? Absolutely. However, now that I am aware of the low light shutter issue, I intend to trade up and purchase a Nikon with better low light ability. But for someone who has never owned a DSLR camera, this is a great first camera!", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast, light, handles well", "Author": "CHUS01 Fan", "ReviewID": "R1YYIY3MBZRGS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera is fast, light, handles well, buttons feel good, solid.

Previously, I've had the Nikon D70, D200 and D90, but I wanted something cheaper, smaller and lighter than those, and this one is a beauty with a lot of value.At first, it seemed really slow compared to my prior DSLRs; there was a long delay before the mirror dropped after each shot.  It turned out the \"Quiet\" mode I had selected really slows things down without much benefit, so I went back to standard single-shot mode.  Flashes also seemed slow, but that turned out to be mainly the red-eye feature.The Live View is OK for occasional use, where you can compose a shot with the display instead of the viewfinder.  The optical viewfinder is big and good enough for my liking, and the display is very large.  Probably bigger than my D200's.The camera is very small and light, so much so that I think the kit lens is heavier than the camera.  I could use a faster lens (this one opens up to only 3.5 or so) but otherwise I'm pretty darn happy with it.  On the horizon are a macro lens that's sold as a sort of contact lens ($60 or so), maybe a bean-bag or flexy arm mount, and I already bought a 16-gig card, a corded remote (cordless isn't compatible) and a simple neoprene bag/cover.Thinking I might stick tiny rubber feet onto the base to protect it from scratches.Very happy overall!", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera... but one little detail.", "Author": "D.

The 1080 HD video is phenomenal.  This makes all my pictures and videos look professional.  What is really amazing is looking at two photos next to each other, one from a really high end point and shoot camera and one from the Nikon 3100.  Even though the one from the high end point and shoot looks really good, there is no comparison next to the photo from the Nikon 3100.  The camera takes continual photos at a really great rate.  3 pictures per second may not be as high as some other model DSLR's, but I use it to take pictures of my daughter when she is playing and running around and it is fast enough.  I just hold it down for a few seconds and snap about 20 or 30 pictures in a few seconds, and a couple of them will always catch her at just the right moment making the perfect expression when she is moving.  The point and shoot we used to use was really nice, but it we kept missing out on great pictures of her doing really cute stuff, because it just wasn't as fast as the Nikon 3100.

I couldn't really understand why I would *need* more. After I bought the awesome Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens I really knew that this was the best camera to get into photography.If you buy this however, you will eventually face two problems. The first, you have to buy new lenses, this is a dSLR and if you want to make it up for the price, the size and the weight, you have to find lenses that will make the difference. I'm talking about the difference between an entry-level dSLR and a bridge or even a Lumix with their nice leica lens and manual controls. This comes at an additional cost, you have to carry and pay the new lenses, the more you get into photography, the more you realize you NEED things like a new bag, a tripod, an external flash, etc. And we arrive to our second problem; At that moment, you will feel that you NEED this new Full Frame dSLR (in my case the d800), and you will find yourself stuck with incompatible lenses and a huge amount of money wasted.So, I feel that the more money I invest while sticking with the d3100, the more I waste money.Entry level dSLR are very limited:- In manual controls: fewer manual switches. This is not a problem for me as I find the software very handy.- In quality lenses: go for a prime or find out most lenses have serious flaws or are as expensive as a Full Frame dSLR- In response time: burst speed, shutter delay- In image quality: cropped sensorMoreover, they are quite bulky.The best camera is the one you always have on you. I would go back and buy a compact camera if I could, some models present the same controls as dSLR and are really impressive. I think the best option would be to have a really performant point and shoot, learn with it, and then buy a FX to really enjoy photography at the highest level.I took several good pictures with it last year, many critics (on /p/ board) praised me for some technical wise shot while acknowledging that DX are really bad. I could indeed see, with time, that a lot of pictures could be stunning, and after looking a while I saw that Full Frame dSLR can give me that. The same way as I thought any dSLR could give me a professional image quality over any point and shoot.To summarize, this is overpriced for a camera, buy a point and shoot to begin, you can learn as much on some of them and get amazing quality. The screen is really bad, it's really depressing to see that the quality of my photos look terrible on the screen compared to, say, the last coolpix from Nikon. If you think dSLR are just better, you are wrong, it just gives you the possibility of changing lenses and if you really want amazing capabilities, an entry-level like the d3100 will not give you anything like that.Now, if you reached this point and still feel the d3100 might be good for you, you should get it. The sensor might be important, and on a DX you will not get anymore quality as on the latest mirror-less camera. But the lens makes all the difference, if you are ready to invest in a few lenses and strongly feel you won't go the FX way that soon. I cannot but recommend getting this camera. It is very cheap for what it is, awesome lenses are available that will amaze you when looking at the resulting pictures. I did some comparison tests when I got my new lens, it really is like day and night, the kit lens should be viewed as a cheap versatile lens that lets you experiment and find out what you really want to do. Sports ? Buy a fast lens. Wild life ? Buy a long focal length lens. Portraits ? Wide aperture and a focal length slightly above the normal range. Etc. And in every category, the results will amaze you. THIS is the whole point of getting the d3100. Enjoying technical photography, understanding your hardware and produce amzing results.With a point and shoot you won't get that, it's just not specific enough and customizable enough. Sure a dSLR is huge, but the d3100 is quite light compared to other DX available on the market.If you cannot afford a FX camera or don't ever want to invest thousands of dollars in photography lenses and gears, I can't recommend more the d3100. If you ever find yourself sticking to this camera, get a point and shoot that you always carry with you as well, this is not an everyday camera at all. You will have to learn a lot about lenses and the technical aspect of photography, else you are a hipster looking to show off with an overpriced piece of gear that you don't understand and I'd strongly suggest you don't waste your money on it.This review is messed up, I just wrote it one shot and I don't expect people to like it, however I hope it will help people who are new to photography understand what dSLR are really about and if they really should get one because they saw the advertisement on TV.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera", "Author": "Nacreous", "ReviewID": "RK65YNBA2Y1XQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 1st DSLR and I'm in love.

The camerrqa met all my expectations.  Being new to DSLR's I sometimes was frustrated when things settings changed and I had no idea what I'd done.  However, that's more operator error than Nikon's fault.  I love the fact that you can shoot bursts of pictures.  That helped tremendously in a number of situations.  The weight of the camera and lens is just so light to me that I hardly knew if I had it around my neck (and that is also true with the 55-300 zoom that I used much of the time.  I also bought class 10 SDHC cards.  That helps a lot when doing bursts as they load on to the card much more efficiently.the only thing i wished i done is shot in raw.  But i was afraid I wouldn't have enough room for all the pictures I took.  I like the fact that you can shoot in Raw or Jpeg or both.  In the future I'll probably switch from just Jpeg to both. But even shooting Jpeg the image quality is great.  The camera is quiet (important when shooting wildlife) and the focus is quick. Occasionally I'd have an issue with the autofocus in low light but it's easy to switch too manual and still get excellent shots.For the amateur photographer who wants a simple to use, lightweight, high picture quality camera you can't go wrong with the Nikon D3100.

As I decided to venture into photography, I started looking for newly launched cameras in 2010 and 2011. I decided to keep the search simple at entry level DSLR as I did not want a complex unit to operate as I learn. I found D3100 a very good option at the time as compared to Canon T2i and D5000.I bought this in Feb-2011 on the President's Day weekend in good sale price. I am thoroughly enjoying this DSLR from Nikon(first one for me). Pictures are neat and clean, ease of use is also simple. Works great with 18-55mm VR. Camera size is not much bulky, though I wish they could have sold this with 18-105mm VR combination like they do in the UK.What I did not like of this camera was the Auto-ISO logic on the Auto option when flash is used. Too much of liberty has been taken away. Viewfinder does not have the ISO reading being in use for the exposure is one thing missing. Viewfinder is easily susceptible to dust particles. Some regular menu options are too much in depth inside and they could have given some rings or options on the body (like D90).What this camera lacks is the drive motor. Hence, collecting lenses is restricted as all AF-S DX lenses are costly.External flash guns available from Nikon or other manufacturer's will not sync above 1/200 or 1/250. This is a drawback to some extent on Nikon entry level DSLR bodies whereas the older D40 did much better with 1/500. The High Speed Sync option is not available in this entry level models.I have'nt used the Guide Mode and wont use as its time consuming and lengthy. Nikon would have been much better by providing some other useful options other than such Guide Mode.I did observe some sharpness issues sometimes, partly because inability to lock focus exactly. Incidentally, the focus selector lock switch is absent on this camera. Higher level Nikon DSLRs like D7000 have the focus selector lock switch.In all, Nikon took away too many \"must-haves\" of a DSLR in the name of entry level.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "my first DSLR", "Author": "praveen", "ReviewID": "RITUBZBM082JY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first DSLR camera.

So why did NIKON stick such a lousy LCD view screen on such a fantastic, over the top camera like the D3100? It's a no brainer folks: M-O-N-E-Y!

Unless you are looking at a review from a professional site that does nothing but camera reviews, most consumer reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt! You have to keep in mind that for a review to have meaning, you must know what camera(s) the consumer is comparing the D3100 to and if the photos are being taken under similar conditions. Comparing the D3100 to a 6MP Canon is useless and so is comparing photos that are shot under different lighting conditions or using different ISO settings or different lenses (zoom versus wide angle).I am not going to go into all of the details as to which camera has what features since my primary concern is picture quality followed by video quality. Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos!I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera. I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23\" HP LCD screen. I did not print them out but viewed them at 200-300% to check out every bit of detail. I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000. The second best - Canon T3i ( not as good as the Sony from ISO 100-1600, but just a little better than the Sony at 3200), third place goes to to the Olympus E-PL1 which did very well when you consider that it has a 12mp sensor versus the others that range from 14.2MP to 20.1MP. In LAST place is the Nikon D3100.The D3100 is better than my old Nikon D40x for sure but not as good as any of the other cameras I used in this comparison. You could say that it is not fair since the Nikon has 14.2MP and the others that rated better have 18-20MP. But then, the Olympus with 12.3MP also did better than the D3100!In terms of Video quality, the Canon T3i and Sony A3000 are pretty close with the T3i being slightly better. The Olympus PL1 fell to last place because the output is in 720p when all the others are 1080p. Nikon D3100 took third place in video quality.Hope that helps a little in clearing up some of the picture quality issues between at least this batch of cameras.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera for action shots if you want to use the live mode!", "Author": "KatyLand", "ReviewID": "R1ER5A7BATSTQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera due to the high customer ratings, and because in theory it claimed to be able to do what I wanted to do with it.

If it's your first SLR, it is a great introduction.I began with Nikon's D40 and moved to this when the size limitations of a 6 MP image became a hindrance to my expanding photography (and print) interests. Given that this model is newer by several years, I expected improvements across the board, but this was not the case.Things I was surprised to see lacking in the features list:Bracketing--an easy feature to implement, not included on this cameraVideography--now becoming a standard on SLR still cameras, this one supports full 1080p video, but only for 10 minute clips. 10 minutes is plenty of time for taking a quick video at a family gathering or vacation, but the limit gets in the way of experimenting with more serious work. The limitation is silly, and removes this camera from practical commercial use.Remote camera control--not the rf trigger; it supports that. I mean shooting tethered for things like stop-motion photography work. Every single Nikon SLR camera (including the old D40) supports this feature, except the D3000 and D3100.Things I was unpleasantly surprised by when shooting:The Auto mode on this camera does not perform as well as the old D40. I found that photos taken on auto were very frequently less saturated and closer to blown out or plugged than I am accustomed to. Setting the camera manually gave me great results.The camera's choice in ISO is ludicrous. Outdoors, noontime, in full sunlight, at 55mm, F5.6, the camera handed me ISO 2200. It very consistently strove to ramp up the ISO to unnecessary levels, favoring sensitivity over shutter speed.The noise. Partly because of the tendency to bump the ISO higher, but in general, I found that every one of the thousands of frames I've shot so far in *every* lighting condition, has a lot of noise. Perhaps this is a product of the 14 MP sensor, compared to the 6 I am used to...but it is a severe chore to set everything manually every frame or clean up all of the noise in post. (Noise reduction has been turned on throughout)So, to sum up: The D3100 has all of the basic SLR functions, none of the advanced ones, creates bland looking photos 70% of the time on auto, and is capable of taking great looking pictures but is noisy. If you're looking for a first SLR camera, the price is right, and it's definitely a camera that can be reasoned with. But as an upgrade to a camera that did everything well but was showing its age?

If you are use to a SLR then perhaps this doesn't matter to you. But if you are like me, wanting a better digital camera with good low light capabilities, you'll be shocked at the size and bulk.I don't like that you have to flip a switch to get to the screen to take pictures. I'm use to using a screen as a viewfinder and like it better because it works better with glasses than having to look into a little view finder.It does not focus as well in the screen viewfinder mode as it does when you use the built in viewfind. I've tried comparing the two in numerous lighting situations and get similar results but is worse in low light settings.It is noisy as the mirror flips around. Again SLR people will not notice this but I do and this makes it difficult to be discreet at a concert or somewhere that is very quite when taking the photo.A real big show stopper for me was the fact that it does not do 30 frames per second in the video mode at 1080p resulution. It only does 24 FPS. You have to drop down to 720p to get 30 FPS. This is unacceptable to me as to why a camera loaded with this much technology cannot do at least 30 FPS at 1080p.This was a christmas gift and I liked playing with the camera for a couple of weeks to evaluate it. Like I said it's a good camera for SLR people wanting to switch from film to digital and you don't mind shooting videos at 720 p, but it's going back.

I am just a shutter bug who has been firing frames almost non-stop since the age of 18.  I learned on my dad's 'old' Nikon SLR with an f/1.2 lens.  The Nikon SLRs/DSLRs I have owned are: N50, N60, N55, N80 and D50.  My N50 ad N80 had the best lenses.  The N60 and N55 were not as great and the D50 was a fabulous entry-level digital.  The only medium format camera I own is my Holga.  But hey, unlike the photographer at Portrait Innovations, at least I know 'medium format' does not refer to the number of megapixels at which I am shooting.  As for my working knowledge, I had three semesters of photography in college.  I can process/print both B&W; and color film.  (Not that that does me any good these days LOL)  I can shoot completely 'manual' and I have stood among many pro photographers on the bridge at sunset, waiting for the color to be just right on Half Dome.  (My Bogen tripod was way too heavy to be practical for an amateur  but it gave me street credit.)  So, in a nut shell, I shoot by the 'Sunny 16' rule.  I know that opening my f-stop should increase my shutter speed give me a shorter depth of field; and, per the great Ansel Adams, f/8 is a proper exposure for all pictures.That said, I hate my D3100.I have had metering issues since I opened the box.  I bought the camera so I could take 'even better' pictures of my infant son than I was getting from my D50.  Ha.  Joke was on me.The contrast was BLINDING on the factory settings and every shot was over exposed.  I have tried every metering option in the menu but the only changes I can achieve are under-exposure, blurred focus and missed shots.  It's go high or go without.I always lower my ISO to 100 when I'm outside because I crave rich color but it's just not there.  I have tried Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. Nothing.  f/16 over my film speed on a sunny day.  That's supposed to work!  I have used it on many a 'less complicated' camera and achieved photos that make jaws drop.  Well, there's no jaw dropping with this camera.The metering overrides my manual choices every time.  It's like I'm having a battle of wits with my camera.  :(  It reminds me of the days when Kodak was marketing 800-speed film as a universal, never-miss-a-shot solution to all your photo woes.  Bleh.  Just because there's always an image doesn't mean it's the RIGHT exposure.I get that being an entry-level/made-for-the-masses DSLR really does mean it's a glorified point-and-shoot but it should preform at least as well as it's predecessors.  Honestly, I got far more reliable results from my Canon SureShot and a roll of Kodak 100.My expectation for a camera is that the image should be very close to perfect when the shutter closes.  I know there's always room for improvement before printing but that's the art of photography.  The hours I spend working on my photos after the shot should be to make them pop.  Instead, my time is spent trying to rescue precious memories.If you are considering this camera as your first DSLR because you think it will improve your skills, skip it.  Invest in an equally expensive point-and-shoot that will give you all the same manual controls and preform much better in low-light situations.  The D3100 does not live up to the standards of a Nikon SLR.I gave it a second star because my son pulled mine off the counter about a year after I bought it and although the case cracked, it didn't seem to hurt the camera.  Unfortunately, it impact didn't help it, either.

I'm planning to upgrade my blogs with my own pictures and art and this was one step towards that.What I know about professional photography is the basic idea you learn in physics. Yes, school does teach you something. My previous camera was actually my cell phone. I've been currently using a n900, that took decent pictures with 10mp, and before that I've used the n82 at 5mp, which was actually a little better than the n900 before it broke down. I know to any serious photographer those two wouldn't even count, but everyone always says the best camera is the one with you and that's what I went on. And, if you actually take a look at the output of these phones, they are better than most point and shoots in my opinion...Now that my current phone is crapping out on me and I decided to grab a dslr. This wasn't my first choice, and I was going to get a t3i, because I love having tons of features but it was out of my price range. You have to consider also getting more than the kit lens, which will run you at least 200+, so considering that, this was the best choice for me. As a new user of dslr, I researched the different features of different cameras using many different websites but my favorite was snapsort. This site gives a good side by side comparison of the two cameras you're thinking of. I'd suggest if you still have any doubts go there and compare the two or more you wanted, and it'll give a better overview.Now the pros/cons list...Pros:-light-cheap enough to get another lens with this kit compared to other kits-guide feature to help with setting up the perfect shot-easy to understand interface in both the lcd/viewfinder-manual settings seem pretty easy to set upCons:-software doesn't seem that great-still a bit expensive for a hobbyist-focusing sound when doing auto focus in video (I knew about this before though, and this can be fixed by having a separate audio recording device)-no external mic input-no bluetooth/ir sensor for the cordless remote (I think you can rig up a wired cord to act as the input to a wireless remote though with the use of an outside microcontroller, but I wouldn't advise unless you had technical knowledge to do so,... such as circuitry and some programming,...)-guide is a bit cumbersome, if you want to switch from setting to setting, this will take some timeAll in all, a great starter camera.

I have not yet had the opportunity to dive into the full feature set.  Initial impressions:Pros: Very nice image quality (my primary concern), easy to use, includes reasonable editing software.Cons: Nikon is bit stingy when packing the box (no USB cable, no memory card at all); no exposure bracketing feature.So far, I have been very pleased with the images coming from the D3100.  The colors are true and vibrant.  It handles light and shadow well.  The captured detail is impressive.  I haven't \"pushed\" this camera yet with higher ISO shots or other more demanding techniques / settings however, I suspect that many of this camera's users, if not most, will not have the need or desire to wander too far away from the \"Auto\" setting, which does a very capable job in variety of conditions.  The flash works well with the camera and there is a minimum of the \"over exposed\" or \"glare\" look that is commonly seen in family flash photography.This camera at its most basic level is dead simple to use: point and shoot.  The camera may look intimidating to those who haven't previously used a full featured film camera or a DSLR but, pick it up, set it to \"Auto\", snap a few frames and you'll both feel much more comfortable with it and intrigued to learn more about its other capabilities.  This camera is targeted for the entry DSLR market and anyone moving up from a compact point-and-shoot camera will immediately recognize the difference in image quality.The Nikon software was also easy to use and can really bring out the impact in your shots.  The software installed without problem on my mac.  Through the software, I was able to pull additional depth and detail from the initial captured image (I used RAW format for capturing).  I did use the default JPEG as well and I doubt that many family photographers will have any complaint with those images.  Again, the various sliders and options in the software can seem daunting at first, but you will be rewarded by playing around with settings (you won't ruin anything).  As mentioned previously, through the software, I was able to take some images that would have been OK and make them compelling.  I am not saying that they will be hanging in a gallery soon, just that they are far more visually interesting than they were and with a minimal amount of effort.  The images included people, nature, indoors and out.I am not completely sold on the auto focusing, especially when the subject is in motion.  I haven't used it enough in these circumstances to fairly comment, just something that has initially popped up as an item to explore further.  For the record, the images in question seemed sharp though not quite what I had anticipated.  It is too early to hang AF from my uses, though.I have not used (and have no immediate intention of using) the video feature.  I have a video camera that shoots video well.  Personally, I'd rather have additional still features (auto bracketing) than video.  I understand that there may be a desire to pack everything within one device from a marketing perspective.  However, I am of the mind that a device ought to focus on its primary mission and forgo additive items that it does less well.I have no understanding of why Nikon would not include a USB cable to connect the camera to your computer.  Fortunately, the cable is not proprietary and I was able to reuse an existing cable from another camera.  How exactly does Nikon propose that you transfer your images from the camera to your machine for use with the included Nikon software?  That just doesn't make sense when the cable that I reused came included with a camera that cost $400 less than the D3100.Overall, I am very happy with the image quality (which makes the omission of bracketing even more noticeable), the ease of use, and the included software.  I would have liked a starter memory card in the box and am really surprised that it did not include a USB cable.  The price for value relationship needs some improvement, though the product itself is solid.  This would be a good way to get into the DSLR segment for those moving up from compact point and shoot.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's enough for me.", "Author": "Young", "ReviewID": "RB84C0OWYYVZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a beginner.

The video is better. The audio is better. It feels better in your hands. Even the neck strap is better. Everything is just better. Yes it costs a little more but it is definitely worth it.

So, when she graduated from college, and got her first job we bought her a \"GOOD\" camera, and she absolutely LOVES this one! Now my husband and I disagree about what constitutes and good camera - we've had Lumix's and Canon's, but she has wanted cameras where she could change out the lenses, and do more actual \"artistic\" photography! More power to her!This is a good one because it has menus on board - to let her know what to do while she's taking pics - so she can learn as she goes, but it also came with a good manual, and plenty of online resources. The lenses are pricier than the Canon lenses, but after doing some research, I felt they were also better lenses, and she was getting more bang for the buck!At first it seemed like I was paying more for a similar Canon camera, but when I actually saw what the two cameras could do, there was no question in my mind that I wanted her to have the Nikon! It was everything she wanted - great variety of lenses, shake control, pop up light - or you can add add'l pro lighting and props, etc. It's everything from everyday to a low end pro camera. Perfect to a entry level high end camera for the more persnickity camera aficionado! I was thrilled to be able to get it for her ... she most certainly earned it after graduating 10th in her H.S. class of 400 with an International Baccalaureate Degree, and  a National Merit Scholar. Then going on to graduate from the Ohio State University with double majors in Management and Operations with Honors, and getting offers from her 1st two choices of companies - Amazon and Eaton Corp! She had to turn one down - Amazon - have you seen their crazy warehouse operations?!  Yikes! Anyway she's very happy where she is, and will be doing a rotation once every year for the first 3 years with Eaton, and then hopefully be offered the job of a lifetime - depending on what is available at the time - she'll be in the pool with all else at the time.But in the meantime with all the moving around she'll have plenty of time to get to know and use her great new camera! I can't wait to see what she comes up with! As soon as this posts, I have some posts I'll move over here from some of the pics she's done so far! Fun girl stuff! Cant wait till her trip to TX = she's never been and plans to do the whole cowgirl experience!

The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.

I noticed that the indicator light on the charger never went solid and that I had only 1 bar of battery one day, which only gave me a few minutes of use.  After a week of that, the battery will no longer even power the camera up even if charge for 24 hours.  (for those who question if it's my fault, I've used multiple outlets that are know to be good and tried fully discharging the battery and recharging it for 24 hours at each)As nice as the camera is, it is useless when it doesn't work.  This really is unfortunate as I have a 3.5 month old who is growing every day and each shot I miss will never come around again.I'm sending the battery and charger in to the service center today, hopefully that fixes it and I get it back soon.  When i spoke with the rep he suggested I try using a battery from a friend to ensure it was the charger or battery and not the camera; I really hope it isn't the camera as I'll lose another week of pictures I'm sure.

I wish that I'd saved my money. My first thought is suckered once, suckered twice. The same defect of the movie mode that I now wished had been fixed is still there. The manual warns of strong light sources, namely sodium and fluorescent lights. They produce banding or flickering, albeit I haven't yet seen as I just got this camera and haven't given it a good test. There is a fix, supposedly, but I have to check that out. My intent was to use the low light features profusely and shoot lots of neon during magic hour. Being that by the manual the movie mode is near useless in this regard, if it's like my previous camera, my aim to buy this upgrade, for me, is defeated.There are cool features such as the added memory capacity support that I needed to upgrade to, from my Coolpix L5 point and shoot. It supports SDXC, which seems to be the future. 14.2 MP is good to have although not worth the money for my purposes. My goals were met using my older 7 MP camera, and for me this upgrade to a DSLR, for now, is totally unnecessary. I can stitch together photos to have the wide angle equivalent, and I had a good telephoto to get as good as with any extra lens, for the most part. I have been into Nikon photography for some 33 years, and I should have left it as that. Instead I decided on the spur of the moment to achieve the professional level in digital, as I couldn't argue about the price.It is full of bells and whistles, and seems to be chock full of tech goodies to appeal to digital novices like me. Maybe I'll get to know this camera better, it is not too intuitive to learn. There are warnings in the manual, you cannot point it at the sun lest you damage the sensors. Fire warnings, even.It is designed to be used by the viewfinder, not by the monitor which I am used  to. Maybe an energy saving feature but doesn't work well for me. I have bad eyes and need the larger LCD image to see what I'm shooting. With eyeglasses it is somewhat inconvenient. You can set it to use the monitor but it shuts off quickly and I fail to see how this can be enabled to do it all that way, yet. If I find better later, I will change my review and rating, but as this seems to have some big appeal, I wish to get out the news that this camera is a big no for me, so far, and maybe then others.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "not liking it so far", "Author": "Lindsey", "ReviewID": "R2WSQKD758YUCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am not happy with it. Such an expensive camera and I can't figure it out. Probably user error but I can't get the graph to come off the screen and it takes forever for the camera to recognize what I want to take a photo of and then shoot it. I can't take rapid photos either...there is a 5 second delay between each photo. I am about to have a new baby and bought this camera for baby pics and to last as the child grows, but I am already hating holding it because it is so heavy. The straps don't seem secure either. A camera bag is a must which mine did not come with, so I will have to buy that seperately. There was a card in the camera box about registering for a sweepstakes. I thought it was interesting until I read that the sweepstakes had expired in 2009! I mean really?? So how long has this camera I purchased been sitting on the shelf the sweepstakes ran from 2008-2009 so the camera is over 3 years old just collecting dust inside the box??
