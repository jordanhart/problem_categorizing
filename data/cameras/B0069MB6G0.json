Case is nice and sturdy. Everything is mounted in the case in a way to give you lots of space to work and run the cables. I tested the voltage and it came out to 12.55 just as I expected. One big positive: the power supply has a voltage adjustment via a small pot. I've already adjusted the output to 13v to counter the voltage drop I'll have in 200' of cable.It does look exactly like the picture. What you see is what you get.Only wish: that the case had some other way to hold it closed than a screw. Any type of latch would be better. Where it's going to be mounted will not be conducive to the screw closure. I'll have to come up with something else. Maybe I'll put the screw in from the inside and push the side of the case in to \"latch\" the lid over the screw. Sounds like a plan to me. Yep, works perfectly!One con: The power cord that comes with it is not grounded. The power supply is grounded to the case, but not to the outlet via the cord. I find this just a little disturbing. Again, where it will be mounted will be to wood so the only ground will be through the cameras. Not a good design in my book. I'll be replacing the power cord with a grounded one to fix that issue. Since it's just a couple of screws like everything else, it will be a breeze to do. For the price of the unit, I would have expected a better designed ground. Made in China right on the box.I'll update the review when I put the product into production and let you know how it holds up.UPDATE: Been up and running for 6M with no issues.", "Date": "October 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works ok", "Author": "Tech/Handy Guy 001", "ReviewID": "R1QSDS69S52Z1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just a matter of the access holes.
