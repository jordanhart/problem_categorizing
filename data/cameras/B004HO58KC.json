{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little Camera with quirks", "Author": "Morley Dotes \"morleydotes\"", "ReviewID": "R34KAOVDYAB1HK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is easily one of the hardest ratings I have had to make. There are some great things about the T300 and some not so great, and some that I just don't understand. Let's start with this, customer service. My first camera did not have audio when capturing video. A quick email got a new one sent to me fast....I mean FAST! Along with a return label for FedEx, which I completed when I got the replacement and sent back the old one at the same time. There was GREAT communication and genuine concern for the customer. A+ for customer service (and this ranks very high in my book). As for the camera itself, it has got some functions that I thought would be a waste....for example: Blink Detection. What a dumb idea, why would I want that, what a waste, blah, blah....this is what I thought.....well, after using it, I'm sold! Blink detection is great and pretty accurate (I did get some false readings). Can I live without it, yes. Am I glad I have it? Heck yes! The image quality is very good, though inside gets lower marks for washed out images. This is a camera you will have to tweak to really get what you want. Video quality is great for such a little thing.....keep in mind this is about the size of a deck of cards (when off), and it fits easily in my pocket. It's nice to record HD video, but know that the best results happened when I recorded outside in the afternoon with very good light. Same goes for pictures. Battery life is good. Sound quality is mediocore. I cannot understand why there is no sound when zooming??? At this level and price it is unacceptable.Ergonomics on this camera are great! Everything is VERY intuitive. You don't really need directions or a booklet. Also, everything is very easy to get to, and you don't have to go in and out of menus to change shooting modes, etc. AWESOME. Optical zoom is great. Image stabillization is good. Shooting options are great. Factory settings needed to be tweaked. This camera experiences some pretty serious lag....even when using my SanDisk Extreme Pro card, and shooting indoors. To speed things up I tried disabling a lot of the bells and whistles, inclduing my favorite Blink Detection. This seems to have helped a little, but I did miss some pictures because of the lag....it's pretty bad and you have to anticipate it. I have not worked around it yet, but perhaps there is a way to tweak it so that it is not so bad. The flash is pretty strong for such a small one. It actually can be a little too strong and washes colors out sometimes....easy fix with Adobe.The best feature, for me, is the panoramic setting. It allows you to line up your shots and get three pictures in one. VERY nice. You shots will come out GREAT! It's so easy to use that you will find yourself taking a lot of these. And because you have to line things up (the camera gives you points to line up to) you get a great, uninterrupted image. This is easily my favorite feature.Viewing and deleting images is a snap and you will not waste time fumbling through different menus trying to go back and fourth. Changing almost any setting takes only a matter of seconds. This was very well thought out.The battery/memory card slot is a little annoying and does not seem to be well placed, but that is a minor complaint. I can live with it. The on/off button is a little difficult to turn on, especially if you have thick fingers, but the good thing about that is that it is also hard to accidently turn it off....so, I'll take it.My last MAJOR annoyance is that I am only allowed 9minutes and 41seconds of HD recording. Really? You couldn't go to 10 minutes? I don't understand it. I am not thrilled by it. What if I wanted to record longer???? Some people actually like to record entire events, recitals, etc. I would normally give this camera 3.5 stars, but I bumped it up because of the customer service and all of the other positives. While this camera also looks quite sleek as far as these types of cameras go, sleek and sexy will end up dying out to functional, because of some of the issues I have mentioned, I don't know that this is a great value.Lastly, I should note that I was recently at a party and someone had a Nikon that looked similar in size to this camera, and they fell in love with the T300. Apparently, they were not happy with their Nikon at all. Good job Fuji. So, am I asking too much of this little guy? I don't think so. I think sound with zoom is important, I think being able to record to the end of my card is important (or at least should be an option) and I think that as little lag as possible is important. These are my major issues, and while many of those issues are balanced by other, positive things I have mentioned, I think I am easily on the fence with this camera. I still plan to test it more, and tweak it, and probably contact customer service regarding some of the issues that I have, and will be editing this post as things change.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Outdoor Camera !", "Author": "Gadget Guy \"Serious Music Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R12Y4HBGPL3B9R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Fuji made a beautiful \"little\" camera with the T300. Outdoor scenery and people look great. In doors - well that's another thing entirely. For a point and shoot with 10X zoom it's quite impressive in terms of what they get into the camera. One thing is missing  - a \"focus assist lamp\". Many cameras over the $200 price point include this feature which results in fast, accurate focusing and therefore sharp indoor pictures, your goal when you pick up a camera.The camera is small - so big hands and fingers may not like this camera as it will be difficult to manage, especially the \"on & off\" switch - which requires a finger nail to execute. For a pocket travel camera that's going to used mainly for outdoor shooting, then it's probably fine. But don't expect decent shots inside the museum, especially w/o flash, you won't get them.I was impressed with the video. While what I saw uploaded to my computer didn't look like 720P - it was still pretty darn good. And the biggest point, the image stabilization was very impressive - Fuji gets an A for that.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera!", "Author": "Koala1356", "ReviewID": "R1XC7P9TIPNCG8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "INTRODUCTION:The Fujifilm FinePix T300 is a fully automatic, pocket, point and shoot camera.  It does best on outdoor (ie: sunny) photos, and has some nice user-friendly features for the beginner/casual photographer.  It struggles a little with low light (indoors), but flash results are adequate.  The preset dial features 8 popular preset modes, including two that are user-programmable to any of the camera's 15 preset modes.WHAT I LIKE:* Compact enough to fit in your shirt pocket, glove box, briefcase, etc.* Beautiful 3\" LCD screen.* 10x wide angle optical zoom is really nice.* Image stabilization prevents camera shake, works especially well with the 10x zoom and/or movie modes.* Continuous shutter mode takes up to 3 images in fast succession. This is great to find on a point and shoot camera.* Easily FORCE or SUPPRESS flash with one button press.  It's right on the lower 4-way dial, so you don't have to hunt for it.* Dial Preset: Natural & Flash: taking 2 photos side by side, one natural light and one with flash, is a really great way to take comparison shots and keep the best looking.* Dial Preset: Auto: I leave it here for 95% of the time.* Dial Preset: Movie: HD 720p movie capable, 30fps with sound.  You can also use the zoom with the movie mode.* Dial Preset: SP1 and SP2 are user-programmable.  It's super easy to set one or both of these to any of the camera's 15 built-in presets. This is a great way to keep your personal favorite presets handy.  Example: I set one to Portrait and one to Landscape.  See the full list of PRESETS below:THE 15 PRESETS:* Portrait: soft overall tones and natural skin tones.* Baby Mode: natural skin tones without flash.* Smile & Shoot: detect smile and shoot automatically.* Landscape: clean scenic shots.* Panorama: guide for setting up 3 (or less) continuous shots.  This works really well.* Sport: for moving subjects.* Night: reduces camera shake with high ISO setting.* Night (Tripod): low shutter speed for night settings on a tripod.* Fireworks: slow shutter speed for capturing fireworks.* Sunset: makes sunset colors more vivid.* Snow: for snowy scenes.* Beach: for beach scenes.* Party: for indoor events.* Flower: for more vivid colors in macro shots.* Text: for clearer lettering in macro text shots.WHAT I DISLIKE:* Battery (NP-45A) must be removed completely from the camera to charge.  The battery charger (included) is almost as large as the camera, so if you are vacationing and need to take the charger, it's extra to carry.* No included cable for TV playback.  It's available, but you need to buy it extra.* No memory card included.  You'll need to pick one up just to try the camera out.  This is my biggest gripe.  Fuji needs to include even a small capacity card in the box, just so you can use the camera when you unbox it.* The USB/PC transfer cable plugs into the bottom of the camera, so you have to lay the camera down on its lens or its screen in order to transfer your photos.  I would prefer to see this moved to the side of the camera, so I can stand the camera up while transferring.IN CONCLUSION:The Fujifilm FinePix T300 is a great point and shoot camera for casual use.  If you're serious about photography, then the Fujifilm FinePix T300 probably won't cut it for you, since all the settings are AUTOMATIC and dialed in via a PRESET.  There is no manual mode, and very little manual settings beyond ISO changes.  But as a point and shoot, it preforms better than average, colors are true to life, it's is easy to pick up and use, and very user-friendly.I would recommend picking up an extra battery NP-45A like this one: Fujifilm NP-45A Li-Ion Battery (Retail Packaging)  or this: 2Pcs Battery+Charger for Fuji NP-45 NP-45A)For a carry case, I teamed my T300 with an inexpensive one from Case Logic, which is roomy enough for the camera, an extra battery, and a couple of memory cards: Case Logic DCB-302 Compact  Case for Camera - BlackFinally, if you intend to shoot movies, a Class 10 memory card is recommended for 30fps capture: Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC Card (TS8GSDHC10)", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great features, easy to use", "Author": "Hedera Femme", "ReviewID": "RDYM0534YE4BD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the non-professional photographer looking to get high-quality images in a variety of settings, this camera works great. I did a little experiment to see how it performed by taking it with me to Europe along with a much more expensive semi-professional Nikon (D3100). Here are the results:Advantages:-With our limited time, my camera was able to take a variety of shots (panoramic, zoom, close-up) quickly and easily while the Nikon could only take limited kinds because of the need to bring several lenses and because of the complexity (sometimes) of setting up a given shot-Because it was small, I didn't have to lug around a big camera bag, which also had the potential of getting a little too much unwanted attention-One feature I really enjoyed was the two simultaneous flash/no flash shot which gives you the same picture with and without flash, letting you choose later which you prefer-Didn't need more than one lens-With city shots of architecture, my camera fared better with its versatilityDisadvantages:-In the mountains, the Nikon did better, capturing color and clarity/detail. In my shots, the trees looked less defined from high up. Also, his zoom lens was able to capture much more detail than my camera.-Nature shots and portraits have slightly duller colors, missing something the other camera was able to capture-There was slightly more blur in shots with movement with this cameraConclusion:For the price, this camera performed much better than I expected and was not as much of a hassle as our semi-professional camera, so for most people, this is not only going to be a better value, but less frustrating and cumbersome. For the professional, this is obviously not the best choice, but this isn't being marketed as a professional camera. This is a great family and vacation camera that everyone can use, and that still yields quality images with plenty of artistic integrity.Great little camera, and fun to use!**see pics for some examples of how this camera performed**", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix T300 Digital Camera", "Author": "midnight821", "ReviewID": "RBEDFA6VU5IQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The last Fujifilm camera I owned was a point and shoot film model years ago.  Since then I have primarily used Canon digital cameras and owned a few Samsung and HP digital cameras.  I often test a number of cameras for both personal and business use so I was happy to get this camera in my hands.  The price vs features on paper really make the FinePix T300 a good buy.  My plans for this camera were primarly for use on quick trips as it's small, but still packs a punch in features and quality.In outdoor use, I was able to use the T300 for some awesome wide angle shots.  The color is pretty good with nice saturation and it has quick focusing for a point and shoot model.  Lighting the in the video mode was also very good, but the microphone was simply okay (but you cannot expect much more in such a small form factor).  I loved the wide angle abilities of this camera and combined with a 10x optical zoom it gives you a great range to work with.  I experienced similar results for indoor use, although it struggled a bit in low light situations.  The wide angle capabilities are great for taking snapshots in small or oddly configured rooms.  The face recognition technology is an advantage and it worked well in the small group settings that I tested it in.If you are looking for a very portable camera, then the FinePix T300 will likely suit your needs.  You can easily slip it in and out of your pocket.  Of course, with its small size come small controls.  It's an even trade off in my book, but you might find the controls difficult to use at times.Battery life with the included lithium-ion battery was certainly on par with similar cameras, if not better.  I'd often recommend purchasing an extra battery though, no matter the model of camera.  I was actually very impressed by the image stabilization on the T300.  I've used IS on everything from point and shoots to very high end SLR lenses and the T300 did a very good job.At the end of the day, the Fujifilm FinePix T300 is a great buy.  It offers plenty of features and extras, although be sure to pick up a memory card (not included).  You'd be pleased to take this camera with you just about anywhere.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple Point-and-Shoot Camera with Some Nice Features ...", "Author": "DACHokie", "ReviewID": "R24HOJMDKLEMSG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those looking for an affordable compact digital camera with the added benefit of higher-end resolution and some common-sense features, the FUJIFILM FINEPIX T300 is a great choice.While the rather difficult decision to purchase a camera is influenced by many factors other than price, I find that reliability is probably one of the most important deciders.  After all, pictures are some of the most cherished possessions we have.  For most of us amateur photographers, nothing is worse than simply wanting to capture a moment but have to play around with camera settings only to discover the moment is gone once we are ready to take the picture ... or even worse, the picture quality doesn't look anything like you thought it would.  I found the FUJIFILM FINEPIX T300 addresses my need for reliability in a simplified manner.  The camera offers several benefits:1) 14 megapixels - higher-end resolution at a reasonable price.2) Addresses the \"do I need a flash or not?\" issue with a mode that takes two simultaneous pictures with one click of the button ... one with the flash on and one with it off.  I particularly liked this feature.3) There is a natural light feature that captures exactly what you are seeing ... this works well in creating the natural ambiance of a low light environment.4) The panorama assist feature is simplified by matching \"plus signs\" (rather than the frustration of trying to match a shadowed image of the preceding frame).5) The wait-time from turning the camera on to being ready is speedy.6) The 28-280mm lens (with a 10x zoom) is equivalent to that of a standard 35mm camera.7) Video can be recorded (with sound) at 720p quality ... while I personally prefer videos being shot with a video-specific device, I believe the quality taken by this camera to be more than adequate if I need to record video in a pinch.8) The camera kit includes a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and battery charger.  The charger allows the battery to snap into it and be plugged directly into an outlet (no cables or wires).While these features stand out to suit my preferences, there are numerous other features that should adapt to just about every taste (blink/smile/face detection, automatic scene recognition, mixed shooting modes, auto focus for action photos and more).While there are many positive attributes to the camera, there are some issues that I found bothersome:1) The compact size of the camera (a little thinner than a deck of card, but about the same weight) may be problematic for those with larger hands.  The paper shuffling required by my job tends to dry out and desensitize my finger tips and the camera was difficult for me to hold comfortably without feeling like it was going to slip through my fingers (the same problem exists with a cell phone/Blackberry).  Rubberized contact points or the offering of a rubber-coated hard-shell case would alleviate this issue in my opinion.2) The software included is a not-so-friendly Fujifilm program that must be installed in order to upload pictures from camera-to-computer.  Trying to upload pictures outside of using the program caused the desktop to lock-up.  Then there is the issue of the pop-ups that offer additional features to purchase once the program is installed.3) The on-off switch is thin and somewhat recessed.  Those with larger fingers may have difficulty turning the camera on or off without having to use a fingernail.4) The panorama feature is limited to three frames.While the problematic issues with the camera (other than the software) relate to me personally, I still found the positives of the FUJIFILM FINEPIX T300 greatly outweighing the negatives.  For a simple point-and-shoot 14 megapixel camera than can be carried just about anywhere, I believe this camera is a real bargain.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera For the Money", "Author": "Glenn R. Howes", "ReviewID": "R25KI71EZC8PKX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In many ways this camera is ridiculously extreme. Actually using a 10x optical zoom means plenty of blurry still shots; unless you mount it on a tripod and use a timed capture. What is one supposed to do with a 14 Megapixel sensor, I'm unlikely to be shooting movie posters with a pocket camera. Still it is quite compact for the image quality. My wife carries around a Panasonic Lumix--Leica lens--from three years back, and the Lumix still makes better pictures than this camera, but is also twice the size and was twice the price; and this camera shoots more than decent video.Strengths:Video has few compression errors, unlike many other cameras, and you can do an optical zoom/autofocus while recording.Built in lens cover.Indoor light balance can be superb with or without flash, or it can be drab, I wish I could figure out how to get consistent results.The unit is very compact, a fact made more remarkable by the telescoping 10x zoom.The macro mode--see my submitted photo of ants on Fruit Loops--is very good for getting detail out of extreme closeups.Weaknesses:The dynamic range of most photos is lower than I'd like giving pictures with a lot of black levels a bit of a smudged look. In many ways, I prefer the output of my wife's iPhone 4S, which has much better color accuracy and white balance.Autofocus is slower than I'd like, although I think this can be improved by turning off extra features  like face or blink detection.Photos taken in portrait mode are not marked as such, forcing the user to manually rotate in their computer's photo organization software.There doesn't appear to be much in the way of vibration compensation; something sorely missed while using that big 10x zoom.Build quality is a bit loose, the cover for the battery/SD card is a bit chintzy, and the lens rattles a bit. Still, this is mainly an artifact of being so small.The microphone is a bit weak and tends to pick up noises from the rest of the camera. Still serviceable though.BTW, I was originally a bit confused by the term wide-angled lens, which I was confusing in my mind with the higher aspect ratio formats used by widescreen HDTVs, but they are unrelated terms. This is a standard 4:3 camera, but it can be set to crop to both 3:2 and 16:9 formats.Summary:A competitive small, inexpensive camera which shines at video capture and closeup work. However, you can certainly get significantly better pictures for more money.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great point-and-shoot - small with impressive zoom", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R390ISGGYBBIGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little camera is a great compliment to a larger digital SLR. It's the perfect size to put it in your pocket and take on a hike or trip to the beach, but you're not going to have a ton of manual control over the pictures. I love the large display screen, impressive zoom, and overall look and feel of the camera.Controls: I was able to figure out how to work the controls quickly. The one thing it took me a while to find were the scene settings - you turn the dial to \"SP1\" or \"SP2\" and then go into the menu and select \"Scene Position\" to change that dial setting to any of 15 options ranging from automatic smile detection to a panoramas, night shots, sports, and \"baby mode.\"Image quality: 14 megapixels is plenty of resolution for snapshots, and both indoor and outdoor shots in ample light turn out very nicely. The color balance seems a bit bluish, especially in pictures with lots of greenery. In low light, this camera is not the best choice. Images blur easily, so it's best to use a flash. There is a convenient mode that will take one picture with a flash and one without, so you have a fall back if the non-flash pic turns out blurry.Be aware that the camera does not come with a memory card. This needs to be purchased separately. I did not install any of the software that came with the camera -- iPhoto immediately recognized the camera and uploaded the pictures.I'll definitely be taking this camera with me on future outdoor adventures and trips where a larger camera just wouldn't be practical, and I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an easy to use point-and-shoot in a reasonable price range.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Fujifilm FinePix T300 is an Excellent Camera and a Pleasure to Use!", "Author": "Lawrence H. Bulk \"Lawrence H. Bulk\"", "ReviewID": "R3IS8S6D92ZKTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) today and I have been testing its capabilities all afternoon. It really is a sweet little camera and is a pleasure to use! Its picture quality is first-rate - and, frankly, that is all that matters.This camera is truly tiny. It easily fits in a shirt pocket! It turns on (and off) very quickly, it is easy to set up and configure, and, as I said, it takes really fine pictures. Any shutter lag at all (delay after pressing the shutter button) is minimal.Some of the controls too are, of necessity, tiny, but I have had no trouble in using them or of inserting and removing the SDHC card. I have average sized hands.This being a (relatively) simple point-and-shoot camera, it has no manual picture settings capability. Nonetheless, there are a large number of adjustment choices to its auto settings which you can effect if desired (including the ability to manually adjust the ISO setting). These are very easy and straightforward to adjust. You can, of course, take pictures in bright sunlight (I did this afternoon) yet you can also easily adjust the camera to take pretty good pictures under relatively low light situations.But so far I have used only the standard Auto setting to actually take photos and I am very pleased with almost all of the ones I have taken.As you can read from the camera's description, it is a 14 MP model with a 10x OPTICAL zoom lens (and that's quite a long zoom range!). Both of these specifications are unusual for this size and price class.The lens is very, very sharp (especially when you consider the low cost of this camera) and the camera has a very useful image stabilization function which helps to minimize blurring.Face recognition (you can put as many as 8 different people's faces in the camera's memory), smile recognition, and blink warnings are also available.Macro (close-up) shooting is another one of the wide range of built-in options offered.There are many competitors on the market but, while there are a number of cameras which may equal this one, there will be few, if any, which will surpass it in terms of the quality of the images produced or the range and versatility it offers.As stated, I have been using the main Auto setting exclusively so far and have not yet experimented with any of the other settings, at least as far as taking pictures. Probably, for indoor use, the Programmable AE setting, where you can adjust the ISO setting, etc., would be the most appropriate one.I did sit down with the camera to examine all of the options (shooting modes) and the settings within them (though I have not used anything other than the Auto setting to actually take pictures so far). I will, of course, carefully read the manuals at an early convenience and I recommend that you do so too. (You can download them from Fujifilm's web site prior to buying the camera if you wish.)Like most such cameras on the market, this one can take video; three settings are offered: 1280x720 (720P HD), 640x480, and 320x240. This is fine - but I plan to use it primarily for still pictures with video used only sparingly.I think that this camera is very well-made, has a truly great lens, and to repeat - this is the bottom line - takes very good pictures.I bought three accessories: Amazon's recommended Case Logic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black); you can't go wrong with this case and it is perfect for this camera.It would be nice if Fujifilm would include even a small starter memory card but they do not. You MUST buy one along with the camera. (Not including a card is unfortunate as the camera has no built-in memory.)So I also bought a SanDisk Extreme 30MB/s Edition High Performance Card - Flash memory card - 4 GB - Class 10 - SDHC. (I strongly recommend using Class 10 cards if you plan to shoot video; while Class 4 is adequate, according to the owner's manual, Class 10 is much better.) Fujifilm recommends the use of only Fujifilm or SanDisk cards (they are the only ones they have tested) and, as they cost no more than other brands, why not go with them?A spare battery would be a useful, though not an absolutely necessary, addition. Amazon sells the Fujifilm NP-45A Li-Ion Battery (Retail Packaging) but, as that is rather costly, I bought this 2Pcs Battery+Charger for Fuji NP-45 NP-45A instead. What a bargain! Not only is an external charger, which can be used at home as well as in a car, included, it even comes with TWO spare batteries at its amazingly low price (under $9.00!). I highly recommend this accessory.But that's it. Nothing else is required. In my opinion, even with these three accessories, which fortunately are very low-priced, this camera overall is inexpensive - and is worth every cent in my opinion.As I have stated above, it is very small, very easy to use, and it takes good pictures. That's really all that needs to be said.I really like this camera and I think you will too, I recommend it as highly as possible. Thank you for reading this review.==================================================================================================================================Update: December 6, 2011Courtesy of Amazon Vine, I now own both this Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 10x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens (Black) and this Kodak Easyshare Touch M5370 16 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom, HD Video Capture and 3.0-Inch Capacitive Touchscreen LCD (Blue).The Fujifilm camera has many more possible adjustments than does the Kodak plus it has a 10:1 zoom lens (and let me tell you: I REALLY like that 10:1 zoom!) as opposed to the Kodak's 5:1 lens but the Kodak is the easier of the two to use.I have taken some pictures back-to-back with both and, at least in my opinion, pictures taken with both are nearly identical in quality.Since the Kodak is the easier of the two to use (it has fewer adjustable settings), I have given that one to my wife and I myself shall be using this Fujifilm model.But either would make a fine choice for anyone and I am very pleased with both of them.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect For Capturing Life's Moments", "Author": "April", "ReviewID": "R3J21D6A3N0UGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm FinePix T300 14 MP Digital Camera is a fine camera for the amateur photographer.

We went to the zoo to test out the camera, the pictures in the nocturnal exhibit were great. We couldn't use a flash and I still am happy.

I was looking forward to the higher quality images from this camera compared to my older Sony. I found the Fujifilm easy to use, but with additional features to satisfy more advanced users. The power button is easy to reach, and even without fingernails, I had no problems turning it off and on. I primarily use the automatic setting on the camera, which makes it a breeze to use and fits the point and shoot namesake for these types of cameras.The zoom feature is nice and I think a good value for the price range. The zoom feature is great for taking nature or sports photos from a distance. The zoom control is easy to access and simple to use.The video is decent and shoots in 720p, but I still prefer to use a traditional video camera when shooting video. For most people who just want a quality digital camera that is easy to use, the Fujifilm Finepix T300 is a good choice.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great First Camera for the Money", "Author": "Addison Dewitt \"I'm nobody's fool.\"", "ReviewID": "R36SN18EWZF7PI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I'm not a professional photographer, but I do use a camera for my work quite often so quality of image is a very important thing for me. Being able to get fine, crisp detail in a shot is paramount. With that in mind, I spent about three hours using the Fuji camera and comparing it to my 5yr old slightly-higher-priced Canon Powershot SX 100, which is 8 megapixels rather than 14. I took all the shots into my photo software and zoomed in on each to do a side-by-side comparison for detail, size, color and more.This is a very easy to use camera if you've used digital cameras for a while. The back viewing area is nice and large considering the overall size of this camera. All the controls and icons are about the same as other cameras, except what was missing for me was manual control over exposure times and aperture. The Fuji lets you set the speed, but takes care of exposure times and aperture automatically. This is somewhat bothersome as I like to set the darkness/lightness of my shots. There are many features that go way beyond the typical needs, one slightly scary one is face recognition where the camera can actually recognize various people if their picture is loaded and identified in the memory. Yikes!The video features focus during a zoom (actually, slightly after the zoom has stopped), which is a nice feature but unfortunately, the sound does not record during zooms. I find this to be somewhat odd, especially if you were recording a live music act or something where you would not want a break in the sound track.Image sizes are a nice size, about 10.75 x 14.25 inches at 300 dpi. (appx 59.5 x 44.5 inches at 72 dpi).As far as quality of image, I gave this camera an OK score. Optics are everything in a camera and while this camera certainly does a fair job, it does not do a great job, especially compared to my old Canon. Even with it's lowly 8 megapixels, the Canon's images are crisp where as the edges at 100 percent blow up on the Fuji's images are not nearly as crisp. And this was using images taken with a tripod with good light. I can't be sure, but I really think that there's some bi-linear interpolation happening on the fly to get up to 14 megapixels in the image. Either that or the lens is simply not as high-quality as it needs to be for this kind of resolution.That said, the images are bright, good saturation of color and certainly good enough quality for someone snapping pictures on vacation or just having fun at a party. In fact, they exceed the needs of the typical point-and-shoot camera at this cost range, so this will become my \"everyday\" camera and the old Canon will be my studio camera where I really need more control and super-crisp shots.All in all, for the money, a good little camera that many will find very fun and easy to use.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "problem with the resolution", "Author": "moustapha", "ReviewID": "R2GPZKTFVE9LXL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the camera stated 14 mega pixel but i dont thing it gets there , the resolution is bit poor compare to other 10 mega from nikon or canon , well its true the zooming is very accurate and the camera very handy but you can find better if you want a best pix resolution", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Tim Challies", "ReviewID": "R8E8P5ZJH6PAP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must be getting old, because I keep seeing products like the FinePix T300 and just being amazed that we can get a product of this quality for this price.

The wide angle means that if needed, you can squeeze 3 walls of a room into a single shot, which is fantastic for birthday parties, children's museums, realtor photos, and the like. The 10x zoom means you can take stealth pictures of your own camera-shy children, plus get rid of 90% of boring backgrounds without having to come uncomfortably close to your subject (be it a dragonfly, a child splashing into a pool, something on the far side of the road, or just scenery). The camera's manual is laughably small, but the controls it doesn't mention were easy to figure out regardless, and the LCD is pleasantly large. The auto-detect mode works about as well as most digital cameras, and the speed is faster than most digital cameras (which drive me bonkers), even though it's not as fast as cameras costing $300+ (which is fine, since this camera costs less than that). Plus it's quite tiny--easily fits in a men's shirt pocket (it also fits into the back pocket of my jeans although it's probably too fragile to really carry around that way).The downside? Image quality. It's decent, but not quite as sharp as my other cameras. The automatic white balancing is good, but sometimes washes things out a bit or leaves things yellowed. (Yes, you can select from a handful of options to adjust for things like fluorescent or incandescent lighting.) And sometimes images are just a tiny bit blurry or choppy at the edges. Still, it's much better than the inexpensive cameras that most of my friends carry.For reference, my go-to camera is a wide-angle, 10x zoom Panasonic DMC-TZ3, which is the same height/width as this one, but twice as thick. That one does take more crisp pictures than this one, but it was also more expensive and is twice as big (not sure how it compares to the newer TZ10 and TZ20 models). I also have a near-DSLR Fuji (FinePix S100fs) that I use, which takes AMAZING pictures when I can get good ones... but to be completely honest I get more bad pictures than good ones with that camera because it's a little more tricky to use. This camera is easy, efficient, and all-around decent, just not quite as sharp when you're being picky. I'm a novice photographer, although I do quite enjoy taking and looking at pictures, and have lost count of the times people have told me I should do photography professionally... but in the end I'm about \"eye\" rather than \"technique,\" and really prefer simple tools. This camera does fit the bill for most everyday pictures, and is quite impressive overall, but I'm probably not going to leave my Panasonic in favor of this one, because of those slight image quality issues that will only annoy the picky.Update: two more notes now that I've played with this more (on an excursion when I couldn't find my other camera), it has a very narrow \"depth of field,\" so if you take a picture of a lake full of lily pads, only one row will be in focus and the rest will be blurry (especially if you've zoomed at all). Sometimes this is a nice, deliberate effect, but I think it's really important to know about before you start taking pictures. Also, the camera does have an \"exposure\" BUTTON, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how to make it do anything! It doesn't seem to work with most modes (I tried auto, landscape, portrait, sports, among others). So if sunlight is reflecting off the aforementioned lake, there doesn't seem to be a way to adjust and darken the picture so the lily pads or trees will be visible rather than dark shadows behind a silvery lake. Again, this might be a nice effect if it's what you're going for, but if you're used to just tweaking the exposure and snapping another shot, it's important to know that's not an option.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera was Defective", "Author": "Judy van de Vrugt", "ReviewID": "RAK0GW6WLIZOR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this model camera before and it worked out great, however it was lost.

It was a few months before I was able to really use this camera. I took it on a trip with me and found a lot of problems with it. For out door shots it was fine (although sometimes the LCD would get washed out in bright sunlight) Indoor shots were another story. Most of my inside shots did not come out, sometimes the flash would not fire when it should have and when it did it would white out the shots. I took it on another trip a week later to a wedding. I brought two cameras, the finepix and my old canon S3. I was going to use the video function on both cameras, for the ceremony itself I used the S3 (because my wife had the finepix and was sitting behind me) I had no problem using the S3 and was able to capture the entire ceremony, for the reception my wife used the video on the finepix (because it is a smaller, lighter camera with a good zoom)  about halfway through the toasts the camera started to whine and shut down, I thought the battery must have gone dead so I put in the replacement battery and the camera would not work. I even tried the original again, still nothing. About an hour later I put the replacement battery back in and the camera came back to life as if nothing happened.The sad part is I lost the opportunity to capture moments that I will never be able to again, had I used my trusty canon I would not have had this problem. I am a canon guy, I have an S2 and an S410 both of them work just as good as the day I bought them. What I liked about the Fuji was the zoom lens in a compact body but it is clear this camera is junk. Since it came from a club store I can return it and either buy a canon or just use my S3 and 410.
