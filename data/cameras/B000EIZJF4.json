{"Reviews": [{"Title": "even better than the ex-z750", "Author": "D. Nash \"scarlett_fire\"", "ReviewID": "R104SK011MFH0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera thinking that it was just a minor upgrade from the 750, with a better LCD screen, another MP, and a few other features I wouldn't notice much. But it turns out Casio made more changes (all improvements from what I've seen) than I had read about in the couple of quick previews I had seen online.First, the LCD is a HUGE improvement from the 750's; this one has a noticeably higher resolution and brighter display, and its brightness is user controlable.It's also faster in every respect, which was predictable, since almost everything in the electronic world gets faster with each generation.The built-in flash (sorry, no hot shoe for external flash) is also better, with 6 settings easily accessed by hitting 1 button on the back: Auto, Off, On, High-Power, Soft, and Red Eye. Plus, you can also set the \"flash intensity\" to -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2, giving us a huge amount of control over what is typically either underexposed or bleached white, especially on such a small camera. This is one feature I've been waiting for ever since I sold my old Canon S45, which possessed the best flash out there, and I'm very happy to have it back.The size is virtually identical to that of the 750-- it seems a couple of hairs less deep, but the difference is so minute that it's not even worth discussing. And the z850 has \"Exilim\" stamped on the bottom left corner of the black LCD screen. Very subtle, yet cool.I have made a couple of movies, one indoors, one outdoors, but I haven't had the time to fully evaluate the quality. Let's just say I'm pleased with the movie mode, given that that's not the main feature (for me) of this camera, and also that I'm used to my camcorder. I will say that once you start recording in the movie mode, you can't change any settings until you stop recording, so take some time to think about the proper settings for your conditions before you hit record.I'm sure there is more to say about this camera, but having just received it 24-hours ago, nothing else has jumped out at me so far. But I'm sure something else will. This is the best compact (not quite subcompact) camera I've ever had, and I've had a few (maybe 8 or 10 by now). The only complaint I have is that the few shots I took at ISO 200 and 400 were quite grainy (especially at the latter setting). However, this complaint is nearly universal in the digital world, so it is best addressed to the entire industry, not specifically or solely to Casio.All in all, this camera gets a rousing 5 out of 5. If you're looking for a small, easy to use camera that also gives you a very high rate of manual controls with tons of features and very good picture quality, I'd suggest you give this one a very serious consideration. Casio has produced one beautiful camera in the EX-Z850.", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "ESCELLENT", "Author": "A.

Finally, after ten years I managed to buy a Casio camera as my second digital cam! When I hold the Exilim EX-Z850, I felt the 10 years of engineering experience in my hand. Although it has not been very well known by most of the people, CASIO (yeah, I know they are more famous with their cheap but solid watches & calculators) was the piooner of the Digital Camera market actually.I think your camera choice must depend on your needs and expectations, not someone's else. Even so, I want to give you an idea about what you get if you would purchase this camera.Before buying Exilim EX-Z850: my expectation was to get a reasonably priced, compact, fast, easy to use (not only for me but the other members of the family) and light camera with a high resolution. I started my research based on these criterias; this is how I end up at Exilim EX-Z850.Some of the positive things about this camera are:1. Very ergonomic (can carry in pocket - depending on the size of your pocket, if it is full or empty, etc. for sure!)2. Extremely easy to use (thanks to Best Shot modes)3. Perfect for beginners, saticfactory for advanced users4. Excellent colors, super video recording (after firmware upgrade)5. Camera responses are fast, the battery is very powerful.6. Manual and Automatic controls, surprisingly well-designed.7. Large and bright LCD screen.8. Solid anti-shake system (but working digitally not optically)9. Reasonable price compare to similar productsAnd the negative ones:1. Not very sharp images (even if at the sharpest settings done)2. Limited optical zoom capability (just x3)3. Small viewfinder.4. Some Digital Noise under low light conditions, but it's manageable.Can you believe if I tell you, you can take the picture of an your old BW picture and Exilim EX-Z850 makes it colorful? Yes I know it sounds crazy but it'is true. There are settings to use it for Video & voice recording as well - these functions are there - not for the sake of having, but for using!You can use MMC and SD cards with it, up to 1GB. However, if you download the firmware - you can use 2 GB SD (not MMC) card. Also, please note that you need a fast read/write speed card to get the maximum efficiency from the camera (min 10 MB/s write speed). It might also be necessary to note that Exilim EX-Z850 can not be used as PC cam.At the end of the day, I bought this camera as it answers most of my expectations. I hope my review can be helpful for the readers to give an idea, what the camera can do and can not do :)PS 1: I uploaded 4 photos taken by Exilim EX-Z850, which can be seen at the top left corner of the product overview page. I specified the settings used to take these pictures.PS 2: EX-Z850 has some noise problems, esp at high ISO setting but it's manageable with some tricks such as low ISO, quick shutter OFF, higher shutter speed etc... Also I heard some rumuors via Internet that some EX-z850 models with serial no above 556XXXXX is fine, below problematic but no chance to confirm this. By the way mine's serial no starts with 276XXXXX.", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Lite, portable, a lot of features, and great quality.", "Author": "ROBERTO J.

For carrying the dock will become irritable. If you have laptop, then use the memory reader there to transport the pictures to your laptop and store.I tend to take a lot of photos while traveling or while I go out to clubs with friends.I need a small camera with an amazing quick shot, good flash and an awesome anti-shake tech.Before this camera I owned a Casio Z-4. This camera offered great features, but it lacked in the zoom dept, and the night long shots. At times I would go out to clubs and the long distance (+ 10 ft) picture would come out blurry due to the lack of light. Also took it to the zoo a couple of times and the digital zoom was not enough to handle the contrast and definition, leaving a pixelated shot most of the time.  The EX-Z850 eliminates a lot of those unsatisfactory hurtles. The camera itself, is very user friendly. The camera come with a lot of preset features for the non-camera savvy. It also lets the user (reg or prof. users) play with the ISO's and the Focus features. This allows for the best picture quality and the easiest and fastest way to take a picture.It has over 30 preset features built into the camera. I, at times get lost or become undecided selecting the best preset for a picture, which is good. I've had this camera for about a month and I've yet to become dissatisfied with its performance.I've tried the video quality and I must say, \"WOW!!!\" The video quality is amazing. I have all the settings at High & FINE and the definitions on the video are quite stellar. However, once you zoom in the quality is all over and you started to see noise all over the video. The video and audio sync is perfect.I love the fact that the flash acts as a light for the video. Staying on if you need it. Something no one has noted here. I thought that was a clever touch by Casio (it can also be left on for pictures).There's hardly any lag between pictures. I've paired this camera up with a 2bg Corsair 133x card and I've yet to experience anything that is lag like.The camera's build is great and long lasting.

A friend of mine had one of these on a recent weekend trip and I was so impressed I got one immediately to replace an old Olympus Stylus. I can't vouch for all the fancy features, I just know I like it.It's small enough that I can carry it around in my purse. It's easy to use even if I haven't figured out all the bells and whistles. And (once I put on my glasses), the lcd is very clear and bright and makes reading the menu options easy.I *highly* recommend you pick up a card reader - it's a little \"thumb drive\" that you can carry in your purse/pocket/camera case instead of the dock to easily read your memory card. I bought the IOGear Universal Memory Drive Hi-Speed USB from Amazon - the one that reads the MMC and SD cards you use with this camera. So, if I carry both camera and card reader with me, I can move pics between computer at home and work or from my camera to any other windows or mac machine. This is a must if you want to easily share pics between computers. (You don't need special drivers for these card readers so unless someone is running very old OS software, you can plug it into anyone else's computer to share pics.)For Mac users, this camera is a breeze. Both dock and IOGear reader seamlessly integrate with iPhoto for stills and iMovie for the movies. Both dock and card reader showed up immediately on the desktop without my having to do anything.I have not used the dock on my windows machine, but the card reader was plug and play on Windows XP. The movies (as .avi) came up immediately and played via Real Player and the photos as well.I was also initially disappointed in the video quality until I saw reference here to the firmware upgrade. I also recommend you update your firmware -  I upgraded to Ver 1.1B and the difference is very noticeable. I am now quite satisfied with video quality.

Frank", "ReviewID": "R3CPEELG44PDAL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera except that it can ONLY connect to a computer or charger using its cradle.  For an ultra-portable camera, that seems to make no sense.  It can't use a standard USB cable that I use for my Blackberry or other cameras, it needs a different one. So that's more to carry.  The cradle is bigger than the camera and its connector protrudes, making it prone to damage in a briefcase.  Because of this I returned the EX-Z850 and exchanged it for a Canon SD-630.It is otherwise an excellent product.POSITIVES: Very good color truth, good auto adjustment for backlighting, fast auto focus, low shutter lag (so you get to capture the candid pics of kids before the opportunity is lost).  An excellent user interface that is really intuitive, and short-cut buttons to access the most regularly needed settings. 8MP is great, but one usually doesn't need it - the lens performance is such that much of the time there's little difference between the 6MP and 8MP resolution.NEGATIVES: The lens is not great however and produces some chromatic abberations (purple fringing around high contrast borders). The CCD shows some color noise at high ISO settings.  I believe Casio has improved this with the about-to-be-released EX-Z1000 10MP camera (launch retail price $399, will be obtainable online at about $349 in June - I saw a posting on J&R; Camera World's site).", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Casio EX-Z850 Fantastic Still Camera", "Author": "MadScientist \"Ed\"", "ReviewID": "R2IM314DW7GS8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera for about 6 months after my Z750 was lost. This is an excellent still camera with many superior features and a modest movie camera. I loved the Z750 but the Z850 is much better.Pros:1. Easy to use after a little practice. Practice will greatly improve your results so stick with it.2. Anti-shake for stills and movies works very well. I rarely use a tripod. This is a great improvement over the Z750.3. Fantastic battery life. I charge mine about once a month or less but I don't use a lot of flash.4. The soft flash mode is a very useful feature.5. Lots of helpful preprogrammed Snap Shot modes and a good manual mode that I rarely use.6. Still picture quality is utterly fantastic with an exceptional macro mode.7. Unbelievable light gathering ability but pictures will get grainy under poor lighting.8. The LCD display is much brighter than the Z750 and this helps outdoors in bright sunlight.9. Very compact size. This is almost exactly the same size as a regular pack of cigarettes.Cons:1. Get a SD card as the internal memory is about worthless. These cards are cheap these days. The maximum supported memory for this device is 2GB so don't bother getting a larger one as you can't access the extra memory.2. I hate the cradle. I bought a wall charger for the battery and a universal USB adapter to read the SD card. My cradle has never left the packaging as it was the same as that used for the Z750. The battery is also the same.3. Forget the digital zoom mode as resolution suffers greatly. The optical zoom is 3X and this is somewhat useful but not very exciting. Casio should increase this.4. If you want a movie camera then buy a movie camera. I haven't seen a combo camera that is good taking stills and movies. This is a fantastic still camera, the best that I have ever used.5. These cameras are fragile so don't drop it or keep it in your back pocket. Get a good camera case to protest it.I store my camera with the selector wheel rotated to the microphone position. This will prevent the lens from trying to open if the power button is accidentally pressed while the camera is in the case.

The digital Elph had all of the features I needed and was fairly compact, but took terrible indoor pictures.  90% of the time I would have to make corrections to the indoor shots I got.  The most important quality to me other than picture quality is that it's small enough to stick in my purse and take with me anywhere.  After reading that the Casio took better indoor photos, I decided to give it a try.  I've been using it now for 2 months.  I don't know how to use all of the features yet (I haven't viewed the manual disk), but so far I am very happy with the quality of photos I am getting.  The detail is really amazing!  It has a couple dozen \"best shot\" settings which allow you to choose specified settings like \"sunset\", \"portrait\" and \"pet\", which are helpful in those specified settings.  It is a compact camera, with a large viewing screen and it still has a viewfinder, which many of the newer models are getting rid of.  Although I'm finding I usually do not use the viewfinder.  The battery life seems to be very good, too.  The camera is also able to take video, hours of it, with a larger disk (I bought a 512mb.  I will rarely use this feature.  Another amazing feature is the zoom.  The optical combined with the digital zoom gets you really close to far away objects.  I was able to take up close pictures of cliff divers from a boat I was on, which had to be at least 100-200 feet away.  My family couldn't believe how close I was able to get.  Any complaints would be minor - I would like to have a cover to go with it, you need the docking station to charge and connect the UBS cable to your computer, and there are a variety of options I do not know how to use yet.

The last one was the Z750 which I unfortunately lost.  When I bought another I upgraded to the 8.1 and I can not believe the improvements made!  One of the nicest and most convenient improvements was in the LCD screen.  I found  that even in the brightest conditions I was easily able to see the screen.  Another nice improvement was in the flash--still built in but under most variables quite sufficient for the light needed.  I just have returned from a two week vacation. I shot over 300 photos( I suggest you buy at least a 1GB card) and never had to recharge the battery.  I am stunned by the quality of the pictures especially those I shot with the pre set best shot mode.  Many of the Best Shot pictures are of equal quality to those shot using the fully manual mode.  I used the camera to shoot extreme close-ups of flowers as well as for landscapes and action shots.  There is nothing this camera can not do.  In fact one day we took the kids tubing behind a ski boat. Using my camera with the zoom, anti shake and preset splashing water best shot I was able to capture fantastic action shots where the camera was able to record with perfect clarity individual water droplets in the spray coming off the tube.  Some of these pictures I have cropped and blown up to 8x10 and have retained the sharpness and clarity.This camera is well suited for those just interested in a point and shoot.  It is fairly easy to operate.  To those looking for more challenge you may go fully manual.  The only draw back I have found is that the complete users manual is on disc.  I would love to have the manual handy when I am away from my computer and using the camera out in the field.

Digital zoom on all cameras is generally useless, but it can actually be used with some success and perfect lighting on this camera. Various Best Shot choices are awesome. This is my ninth digital camera, running all the way back to 1992. For versatility and great movies, this camera is a top choice. Also uses cheap SD cards, a real plus. Battery life is outstanding.For great photos no matter what the lighting, pick a Canon. They always come out ahead of any other camera I have used, and I have used most of the popular brands.For the best low light shooting in consumer cameras, the Fuji Z1, Z2, and Z3 are better and currently owning both the Z850 and the Z1, I like the non-protruding lens of the Z1 much better. It is also a bit lighter and thinner. I also love the low light capability of the Z1. The only downsides of the Z's are xD picture cards and non-mpeg4 movies.In the final analysis, if size is not a problem, pick a Canon.

This was my third camera in the Exilim line - prior to purchasing Z850 I have owned Z60, as well as Z600.  Both were great cameras.  I mean, what's not to like?  Clean, sexy look; easy to use; great picture quality.  But having to work for Kodak in the past, I decided that I want to get more involved with the world of digital photography and post processing, and in order to do that I needed something with a little more manual control, so I sold my Z600, and got a Z850 instead.  Big mistake!  I ordered it directly from Amazon, and it was a brand new camera.  Right of the bat I got a defective unit!  The problem - it was very inconsistent at taking sharp pictures, especially close-ups.  The shots were blurry for the most part, and the colors were a bit off as well.  How is that for quality and reliability?!  But I thought to myself, \"it's okay, it happens\", so I returned it back to Amazon (thanks to their great return policy), and got myself another one, this time from TechToysForLess (it was a lot cheaper comparing to Amazon).  One thing to be aware of - TechToysForLess sells what it's called \"grey market\" cameras.  I knew about it ahead of time, but someone might not, and then be unpleasantly surprised.  For those who don't know what it is - the \"grey market\" refers to the flow of new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended by the manufacturer.  Only new products fall under the legal, accepted definition of grey market.  Grey market goods are being sold outside of normal distribution channels by companies which may have no relationship with the producer of the goods.  Frequently this form of parallel import occurs when the price of an item is significantly higher in one country than another. This situation commonly occurs with cigarettes and electronic equipment, such as cameras.  Entrepreneurs buy the product where it is available cheaply, often at retail but sometimes at wholesale, import it legally to the target market and sell it at a price which provides a profit but which is below the normal market price there.  So, the product is legal, it's new, and it's cheap.  BUT... In some instances, there could be minor differences between the \"authorized\" product, and the \"grey market\" one.  For example, a \"grey\" Z850 doesn't have an eBay mode, but offers an \"Auction\" mode instead.  It's a bit different with respect to settings.  Also, there is no full blown manual in the box, but rather a short \"how to\" instruction in various languages.  However, the full manual can be found on a CD-ROM.  Another difference, and that's actually a plus I think, is that it comes with a European power adapter, whereas American sold models don't have that.  The biggest concern with \"grey market\" products, however, is that in some cases manufacturer will refuse to honor the warranty, so you have to be aware of that, and check before buying.  I knew all of the above, but still took a chance, mainly because the price difference was significant, but also because TechToysForLess had a 10-day return policy, and I thought that it would be enough time for me to \"explore\" the camera and find out whether it's defective or not.  In any case, I placed an order, and three days later held a new Z850 in my hands.  I didn't waste any time, and when the battery was fully charged, I started taking shots left and right.  All of them were crisp, clear, and sharp, so I knew the unit was good, and the lens wasn't defective as it was with the previous one I had.  However, and I noticed it right away because I tend to take mostly pictures of people, the colors were a bit \"warm\".  What I mean is there was a slight cast of \"pink\" present in all pictures.  You wouldn't notice it in pictures of architecture, food, or nature, but people's skin tone looked somewhat unnatural, and it was very obvious.  Neither Z60, nor Z600 had that problem.  I still kept the camera though because I could take care of it by doing some minor editing/post processing.  What finally made me gave it up (I sold it on eBay), was the Casio's ignorance and unresponsiveness to the fact that it had a \"broken\" movie mode.  The original firmware, version 1.0, that the camera came with had a problem with \"stair stepping\" - the movies were \"jerky\", and \"noisy\".  After numerous complaints by the customers, Casio released two new firmware versions, 1.1, and 1.1B that supposedly \"fixed\" the movie issue.  But what they in fact did was just \"cripple\" it - the movie angle was cut by 40% in version 1.1B, and the picture quality actually got worse!  Version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything, but rather \"improved\" already decent picture quality, and added support for high capacity memory cards.  Also, I've heard from a lot of people that even if those cameras function properly in the beginning, there is a big chance that they will brake later due to poor quality.  I didn't want to wait to find out, so I got rid off it.I didn't do my usual Pros and Cons type of review in this case, and from above comments it might seem like there is nothing positive about this camera, but it actually does have a few good things.  For one, in addition to its big, super-bright display, it has a viewfinder!  A big plus in my opinion, especially when shooting outdoors in direct sunshine.  Also, on top of its numerous preprogrammed  Best Shots, it has some manual controls, giving you even more flexibility.  It's a nice little camera.  Unfortunately, it lacks in two important departments - quality and reliability.  I wish I could say that I enjoyed using it, but it was more of a hassle than fun.However, I still stand behind Casio products.  After I sold Z850, I got myself a P700 model, which has been discontinued for some time now, and is virtually impossible to find anywhere.  It's a semi-pro model, and offers even more manual controls than Z750/Z850 models.  Excellent camera!  A true performer!  Built like a tank, has a sharp Canon lens, and made in Japan for a change! (all other Exilim models are made in China, which could be the reason for poor quality)  I've used P700 for a couple of months, and... sold it :-)  Yep... Call me crazy, call me whatever you want - I just decided that I want even MORE manual control and flexibility, so I got myself Panasonic DMC-LX2.  One word - Wow!  What a camera!  Optical Image Stabilization, Wide Angle Leica Lens, RAW format are just to name a few of many features of this truly great little gem of a camera.  I've had it only for 2 days now, but I'm already in love with it.  Don't forget to check my review of it, which is coming shortly.  I didn't completely abandon Casio's though - my present to my wife for Valentine's Day this year - Casio EX-S770 in Red color.  I'm definitely going to get my hands on it also, so come back for another review soon.  Once again, I hope I've provided you with some help in your camera purchasing decisions.

After owning it for two months, I can say I think we made the right choice.  One of the main selling points is the compactness.  You can fit this camera in a shirt pocket.  Cameras this small have to make compromises to stay affordable.  In many cases this means a cheap LCD display.  Not so with the EX-Z850.  The LCD on this camera is crisp and is easy to see in all kinds of lighting conditions.  The buttons are also large enough to use and I think the operation is intuitive if you have used a digital camera before.  The picture quality is also good (as good as most of the cameras in this price range) and I found that the digital anti-shake is more effective than any I have seen.The thing that makes this camera stand out is the fast shutter lag.  This can be a real problem with some digital cameras.  This is the primary reason we bought the Casio over Canon.This camera continues the \"best shot\" modes from other Exilim cameras.  Some of these are very useful (like the eBay mode), but there are too many of them for me and I would rather set the settings myself anyway.  People who are unfamiliar with digital cameras may very well like these modes though.8.1 MP may seem like more than you would need for pictures you are likely to take with a compact camera, but it actually makes the camera more versatile.  We have substantially cropped photos to make them more interesting without losing quality.  We were unable to do that with our old 5 MP camera.", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "EX-Z850", "Author": "John L.

You use the charging cradle with a USB cord to connect to your computer and it does not connect directly wit a USB cord. Holds an extremely long battery charge. The large 2.5\" viewing screen takes up nearly the entire back of the camera and you will need to be somewhat careful not to mar the screen.

For most, that is not a big deal, but I really like that feature myself.  They moved some features around from the 750, and created a aperature priority mode, a shutter priority mode, and manual exposure mode, all on the mode dial.  I'm no expert photographer, but this flexibility has helped me take better long-exposure photos, or making HDR's with different exposures.  One thing I like about these older Casio's is the format of the movies is MPEG.  We bought one of the newer Casio models (since returned), and I did not like that they changed the format to Quicktime.PROS:-very simple controls.  Once you learn the mode dial, everything is self-explanatory.-shoots great pictures (8MP) with decent default settings.-has most of the bells and whistles (and then some) that other compact digital cameras have.-greater flexibilty than most pocket sized digicams\\-movies record in MPEG format, which is a nice all-purpose format.CONS:-an older model, slightly bulkier than today's compact cameras.-screen is a little on the small side (2.5\" lcd)-movie quality seems to have gotten worse than on the previous model, z750.Even though this camera is ancient now in 2008 (it came out in 2006, hah!), I still had to find a used one because I'm not as impressed with today's moron-point-and-click cameras that seemingly do all the thinking for you and take away all the flexibility in shooting.

The contrast and saturation are easily compensated, but the brightness adjustment requires a -0.3 EV setting that is not \"sticky\" - it isn't remembered when you turn the camera off. The only way to save this so that you don't have to reset it every time you turn the camera on is with your own Best Shot setting.

Its size is so small that I can carry it everywhere, all of the time, in my very small purse.  That way when I want to take pictures, it's always ready.  And as others have said, it powers up very quickly, has very little lag time, and am amazing battery life.I'm an amateur with mild ambitions of getting into more serious photography which is one of the reasons why the fully manual mode appealed to me.  It is, however, manual largely in name only because the range they give you with the aperture is so limited that it's really not functional as a manual camera.  Instead it's really best thought of as a point-and-shoot with a lot of great modes (and the white balance is a real life saver).The disappointments are that it could do better with close-up zooming.  Sometimes when I'm shooting flowers, even in macro mode, I can't get nearly as close as I would like and have it remain in focus.  My photos are generally very clear, though there have been shots that I've tried taking and not ending up pleased with any, despite working through various modes and functions of the camera.

Judging by the apertures, I think it's pretty obvious Casio employed that technique.However, the number one reason you do NOT want to buy a Casio is Casio's \"customer service\".  It is horrible.While hiking on vacation, I placed this camera in my pocket as I had done dozens of times before with my Canon... and the screen broke.  I was hiking up a very steep hill when the screen broke.  I think the screen should've been built tougher.  Completely ridiculous... and the fact that I couldn't use the camera for the purpose I bought (the vacation) it for still burns me!I wrote their \"customer service\" center, and waited for a response, and waited, and waited.  They never even bothered to respond to my letter.  Not even a boiler-plate form letter.  Nothing.  I called them and they basically said there's nothing to do but send the item in for repair.  To make a long story short, after a couple other missteps I finally got the thing mailed in, repaired, and returned -- all for the wonderful price of about $200... and this whole process took about 6 months (including my waiting for their response).I am very unimpressed with their customer service and would not recommend buying from Casio, just on the off chance you might have to deal with their \"customer service\" department.", "Date": "November 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, No Regrets!", "Author": "C.

I bought it in January 2007 and loved the quality of photos, size, and ease of use. Technically, it was a wonderful camera (much better than my Kodak EasyShare). Then, in early March at my first ultrasound for my first pregnancy, while we were waiting for the doctor, we looked at photos on the LCD. That's it--we looked at old photos. The lens froze in the open position, the camera wouldn't turn off or on but would only beep, and we were unable to take any photos. We recharged the camera on its base to no avail. Because other reviewers had this problem, I bought an extra warranty through Amazon, but it won't kick in until after Casio's ends one year after purchase. Casio, so far, has been a nightmare to deal with. Their technicians claim \"impact/lens deformation\" or a broken lens, and want to charge $137.07 to fix it (about half of what I paid). I've had my claim reevaluated with the same answer. So far, it's in their hands and, unless the next reevaluation goes through, I'll have to pay their fees plus shipping to have it fixed WHILE UNDER WARRANTY. Just a warning to all of you--BEWARE OF CASIO'S REPAIR CENTER! I assure you that, other than reviewing photos, I did NOTHING to damage this camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "I liked it.

I bought it because I like the compact size, I had a good experience with my old Exilim 3.1MP, and the 8.1MP was high ranked in Consumer Reports.After I received the Exilim Z850 it seemed much better than my old Exilim.  Besides having more MegaPixels, the viewing screen was much bigger.  I found the camera very intuitive and easy to use.  Minor complaint would be that my fat fingers sometimes get in the way of the small buttons while trying to delete pictures.Everything was great until my Z850 stopped working 6 months later.  I called Casio Customer Service and they told me to mail it to the local service center with my receipt and a letter of explaination.  I payed the $5 to ship it.  Two weeks later it showed back up to my house via the mail and it worked again (and no additional costs to me).  I would have to say the Casio customer service was good for that experience.My Z850 is happily taking pictures of my kids again although I am slightly concerned about the reliability since my warranty is probably up.  My old Exilim 3.1MP never had any problems and still works (I used it while the newer one was in the repair shop).So in conclusion this is a nice, compact camera that takes nice pictures and is rated high in most consumer reviews.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the reliability issues.J.Clark-San Jose/CAPS - Casio if you are reading - I'd like to see you expand the Exilim franchise to include shockproof/waterproof models.", "Date": "June 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Magnificent Pictures", "Author": "PRPC", "ReviewID": "RLQPQK0KMA63G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not consider myself to be anyhting but an amatur as a photographer.
