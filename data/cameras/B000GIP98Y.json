Recently, some of those tools went missing and I had no idea where they went.  One here, another there and no one seemed to know who took them. I setup this camera without telling anyone what I was doing and connected it to the old VCR we had and pretended I used the VCR only for the clock.  On the second day of recording, I caught my Brother-in-law coming in to grab tools.  When I confronted him, he confessed to taking the tools and claimed that he was planning to return them but kept forgetting.  I still havent told anyone about the camera.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera, cheap power connector.", "Author": "A. Waldo \"W4WMM\"", "ReviewID": "R3O65OUMYYODT9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is all it is advertised to be.  My only complaint is the power connector's.  They don't fit very tight so a little wiggle and you lose power to the camera.  I taped them together to minimize motion and make sure it doesn't get moved after installation.  Otherwise it's got good resolution.  I would order another, if I needed one.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "missing adapters", "Author": "re5jim", "ReviewID": "R2DQBB3EVJWVT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera for the price.

Gregory", "ReviewID": "RQ5IOVJ03APJP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a few surveillance setups with various cameras and this small compact camera is of comparable quality to other entry level cameras.  It is not plastic!  It is metal with quite a bit of weight which helps with stabilization.  Please see my customer image.  Although our particular application of this camera is not ideal, the image should give an idea of the quality one can expect on a smaller scale.  It is also in color and of better quality than ones I have seen hidden in clocks.  It is small enough to be undetectable and small enough for a user to hide in a clock or radio without the expense of a prefabricated surveillance product.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works better than expected.", "Author": "seedpacker", "ReviewID": "R28P5N8QIS2MR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the 5 star rating expecially for the price,  I have used it for a month and  get somewhat grainy black and white nite video which is still very easy to watch and with any amount of light it really has worked well.  It is easy to mount with the bracket, I have yet to do that- but overall suprisingly good picture quality for something so tiny.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect little camera", "Author": "Denise \"Denise\"", "ReviewID": "R2UOXLQ51JSGJV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for an art project. I needed something small enough and inexpensive enough to do what I needed to do...observe. The only problem was the description didn't tell me I also needed an BNC to RCA adapter. But once I got that from a local store, everything hooked up fine. Amazingly nice picture. I saw the same setup at another site for $100 more. Good price, good product, fast shipping.

I needed to grab cable inside a wall and couldn't see it in the space.  The plumbers snakes were either to short or too expensive.  A couple 10' copper pipes, electricians tape, string lights, and this camera and my job was done.  The quality of the video made finding the cable so easy.  My order came missing the BNC to RCA adapters but I didn't have to return it to Amazon.  I contacted the seller and let them know and they sent me the adapters right away.  Great service, great camera!

The description is MISLEADING. You will need to buy an extra connector for $49 (from them, of course). Also, the camera does not come with directions or any software - and if you have a MAC it will never be compatible.
