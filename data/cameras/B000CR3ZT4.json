{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A remarkable instrument, not just a camera", "Author": "Patrick L", "ReviewID": "R1UPD315QZEBWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disappointed by my recent purchase of a Sony Cybershot DSC-T10 digital camera I made a gift of it and bought a Minox DM1 digital camera, which is a shirt-pocket-size miracle. In addition to taking digital pictures (with an option to print the date on each shot or not, a useful basic feature that the hyped Sony Cybershot DSC-T10 lacked), it is also a video recorder and player, a web cam, a voice recorder, a flash light (!) and a quality MP3 player. The camera comes with an 128 MB internal memory (more than double the 56 MB of Sony's high-end ultracompact digital cameras) which can be augmented if you buy an easily inserted SD card of up to 1 GB capacity. Thus, you can take your pictures in the generous internal memory and store approximately 350 MP3 songs on the SD card. (Playable file formats: JPEG [EXIF2.2]/ ASF [MPEG4] / WAV / MP3 / WMA). The quality of the sound is at least as good as that of an IPOD when using the supplied earbuds but, unlike the need to buy external speakers to play an IPOD for others to listen also, the DM1 contains an amplifier and a speaker that yield an acceptable sound.You can recharge the Li-ion battery using either the supplied AC/DC power adapter or the supplied USB cord that doubles as a USB connector and charger. The DM1 also came with A/V cables to show photos or videos on TV. Finally, unlike the IPODs that force you to buy a lot of unsupplied accessories, the DM1 came with a padded case. Also, unlike Apple's undesirable \"proprietary\" restrictions that code the contents of your IPOD so that you cannot use it readily as a USB flash drive, the DM1 is also a plain flash drive allowing you to move up to 1 GB of data through the SD card and another 128 MB through its internal memory. The DM1 also plays music through a car's audio system with the accessories such as a cassette connector or an FM transmitter.CAVEAT: The DM1 is NOT a point-and-shoot camera but is more like a professional camera. If you set the shutter to Automatic you may get blurred images in low, even medium, lighting conditions. The key is to change the shutter speed from Auto to 1/125 sec. Then check the scene on the 2\" LED screen and if it looks right, take the picture. If it looks dark you can increase the Exposure from 0.0 gradually up to +1.8, and/or increase the ISO value from 100 to 200, even 400. Conversely, if the picture looks too bright, reduce Exposure and ISO value. So, what you see is what you get.DISADVANTAGESNobody's perfect, so the DM1 came with two disadvantages.(a) Uncertain availability of service and parts for Minox digital cameras in the USA; however, one could check with MINOX USA Inc., 438, Willow Brook Road, Meriden, NH 03770, Tel.(603) 469-3080, before giving up. I did not get any warranty from my first US seller, but the US seller of a second DM1 camera I bought did send me a manufacturer's warranty card that still lists Leica Camera as a USA service contact, although Leica and Minox parted company in 2005. Of some warranty consolation is the legendary Minox quality that promises flawless performance.(b) The supplied manual I got is in German with a skimpy Quick Installation Guide in English, which urges you to download an English manual from Minox's German site. The web address given produces an \"error\" so you then access the Minox site in Germany, click on the English flag for the English language version but you see no window for service or downloads. You do a site search for manuals and you get a list of manuals not including the DM1. Desperate you do another search for DM1 inside the Digital Cameras Manuals page and, lo and behold, at last you see Minox DM1 (deutsch) and Minox DM1 (englisch), the latter being what you need.You download it in .pdf format and print it; however, even though it is 56 pages long it is more a collection of the DM1's numerous features and specs than instructions on how to use it.  For instance it does not explain the difference between Light Meter Center (measures light in the very center of the picture) and Central (measures light in a wider area in the center of the picture). Finally, Minox's German web site invites you to submit technical questions by email. I did but got no reply. Nevertheless, as the DM1 is cute as a button, you set aside some weekend time and fiddle with it until you learn how to use it by trial and error.These disadvantages are the price to pay for something that runs circles around Japanese ultracompact digital cameras and IPODs.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "A worthy successor to the Riga !", "Author": "Michael Irwin", "ReviewID": "R10KHE4KDC1U3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt for my wife, over her objections that she would never use it. Within a week I had to buy another memory card ! It's very easy to use - almost \"intuitive\" in that things do what you expect them to do, and fully lives up to all the expectations created in the product blurb.Pros - in addition to all the advertised goodies, the battery is a standard phone battery, so you can get spares and recharge them in advance using a phone charger !Cons - if you're taking stills in lowish light, get some practice at standing still before hitting the shutter button !", "Date": "April 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "For 49 bucks are you kidding.", "Author": "museken", "ReviewID": "R35H5EC7TWT7AW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally was looking for a cheap camera.(I own Olympus and Pentax only for price and quality). All I read was 3 star reviews on Vivitars. Then I came upon the Minox D1 and yes the instructions are in German and the charge cable is a Europe socket(can't be used in America). You can charge it using a laptop or any computer and it last. 1st. Its a camcorder, camera,mp3 player,microphone recorder, player, bright high lumens blue flashlight,and web cam. 2nd. The directions in English are little but you can figure out the Minox yourself. You simply push the mode button for what you want camera mp3 player etc.. scroll down or across the window icons with the dial and push the dial. To start cam-cording or take a picture you push the button on the side of the unit. The lens rotates full circle so you can film yourself and while still recording flip it to record your friends or whatever. This is one of the best features I have ever seen and can't help but wonder why all cameras are not like this. When your finished with the lens you rotate it to the close position which protects it. You never need a cap on the lens.3rd. The camera does need a steady hand out of the box but the menu options allow you to create the camera you want. The thing that really killed me about this was reviewing the pictures I took. I took a picture of a far away image in the distance it came out discernible. This camera has a zoom after the pictures taken so you could zoom in after the shot. You can choose any zoom you want and print it. You ever take a picture and say boy I wish I was closer. The Minox makes you closer after the shot. That Image on zoom was crystal clear.4Th. Everything works on this camera. Nothing is difficult but you may want to download your country origins directions from the Minox site.  The Minox D1 for 49 bucks is killer, this multi-entertainment tool does is backed up by the examples Minox installed on this unit. In the right hands and for people who read and are willing to download directions the Minox is a steal. I feel like a thief. This is one of those products missed by the masses. Is it an Ipod, 49 bucks come on. I gave this 4 stars because  Minox D1 should of had some Wi-Fi and the screen a little bit bigger.  Those features would make it 5 stars. For a he or she who is knowledgeable of camera's D1's a little but sturdy product.  Remember I was looking for a cheap 25.00 camera which would satisfy me, none exist, so the ante went up to 50 bucks. The Minox came to my door with the idea of something that can be abused and not be missed because it could be replace.  I can't replace this Minox. The Minox is used more than my Olympus or Pentax. Granted the Olympus and Pentax kick its butt in picture quality but your going to pay $50,00 to $200.00 or more for them.  This is a $49.00 camera that does more than anything else out there for \"that\" price effectively, 5 STARS! period! If your someone who doesn't own a cell phone,  Minox is for you. (No Internet.not a phone). Thank god, it's yours....", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "it's a jack of all trades", "Author": "Dana G.
