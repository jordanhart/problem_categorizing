But the whole 18x zoom is bs. I bought this camera hoping for a good long shot because I'm out taking pictures of wild life all the ime.This camera is basically zoomed ALL THE WAY OUT!! So in actuality, you have to zoom in at least 10x just to have a regular view. So I guess in reality, this camera is just a plain old 8 zoom like most cameras.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$179.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung WB150 14.2MP WI-Fi Digital Camera with 18x Optical Zoom and 3-inch LCD in White + Samsung 32GB Deluxe Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KFLAoaH5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007P4V8XC"}}
