{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Felipe Antonio Amaya, M. D.", "ReviewID": "RPJTYLZASL130", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is another piece of garbage I bought from this Co.  I began working just well & 3 days later It no longer worked.  @ first, when I turned it on some kind of wall-paper looking screen appeared  with no way to control it by pressing any button; not even able to turn it off by pressing that button.  I then let the battery run out to see if this would re-set it & we could start anew.  I charged it for almost eight hours & then it would not turn on @ all; it was totally dead.I asked for a return slip from the vendor & I was then advised by Amazon.com that such vendor was no longer dealing with then & therefore I could not try to obtain refund for this piece of metal. So I am now left with an almost $70 piece of junk for which I had saved $5 per month for over a year.Yes they do have technical support. However, such offices must be located outside where they only think they can speak English. I spent almost 3/4s of the time asking the technical adviser to repeat what he had just said for over an hour because I could just not understand what he was trying to say.  I became so angry & frustrated that I decided to just give my money as a loss rather that develop a sudden stroke or heart attack trying to make this piece of garbage to work.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EYJ60OI"}}
