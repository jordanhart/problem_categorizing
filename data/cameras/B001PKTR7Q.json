I was so used to using my camera phone to get snapshots and video, I had no idea that it could get better than that. This camera is great for the price. The only thing I didn't like about it was that when you use the movie feature, the sound cuts off when you try to zoom in or out..and the fact that it doesn't play sound until you plug it into the computer.

I have used Kodak, Cannon, etc but I had to adjust Brightness, etc. to before I take the picture. Otherwise, picture came out very bright and red. But with this Samsung camera, I don't have to adjust anything and still gets the best picture color. Only bad thing about this camera is the response time. After I take 1 picture, I have to wait for a few second to take another.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "love it!! but 1 issue.", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R3O652YZF699U1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "love the camera its light, tiny and is easy to use. I wanted something that i could throw in my purse but still use to take beautiful pictures. i like the fact that it starts up fast so i can get the funny moments with my friends. the only downfall is that the camera doesnt take pictures sometimes(only happened twice) seems to not read the faces or something but besides that i love it! great camera for someone always on the go and wanting fast and awesome pictures.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "jack", "ReviewID": "R11VI0NCHQJKRW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sure cannot expect much from a camera less than 100$. The pictures taken without zoom are good enough. Slightly washed out due to flash in areas near the camera, so gives slightly uneven colors and brightness. But pictures are bright enough with the flash, unlike some other cheap cameras which give pretty much unusable pictures with flash.The problem is when you zoom-in. The pictures look as if taken through a cloud, it looks surreal :) The objects are not sharp, so it looks like they have an aura or halo around them. If I could attach a picture I would have shown.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Product", "Author": "Jennifer Hu", "ReviewID": "RGM2UV0B9DSAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is truely great.

Fruin", "ReviewID": "R1FKSAK7FSH9AD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My expertise in photography is limited to the old Polaroid cameras and my wife is only slightly better. Therefore, I knew absolutely nothing about digital cameras and was afraid to take a stab at purchasing one. I read the reviews on the Samsung and decided to take the plunge. To give you an idea how inept we are, I bought it Nov 10th and we didn't try to use it until Dec 15th because we were afraid we'd ruin it before we started. All our fears were for nothing. This camera is easy to use and the pictures are beautiful! When I took the memory card in to have them developed the guy who did it told me he had spent several hundred dollars on another camera and it didn't give pictures as good as mine. We are extremely pleased and thankful for the Amazon reviewers who recommended this camera.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera but lethargic seller", "Author": "PD", "ReviewID": "R24DSQCSFTODO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera - for its price class, it is a winner with great features, good picture quality, easy to use in program mode yet sufficient controls for the beginning photographer to get a taste.  I purchased this camera for my nephew on his birthday and hoping that he will get hooked to photography (like I am) and progress on to more sophisticated gear.

I love that I can hook it up to any computer-don't have to download software first.  I also love that I can hook it up to my T.V.; and the camera's screen is fairly big, too.I should note that the AV cable does not come with the camera.  You can purchase it separately at Best Buy for around $20 (approx. 6 ft. long)or you can purchase a much shorter cable thru Samsung.  Samsung charged roughly $9 for shipping and handling, coming to roughly $20 for the cable with S & H.You can edit your pictures on the camera.  I believe you can also use the camera as a camcorder.This is my first digital camera.  Consumer Reports (January 2010?) recommended it, among others.  Not all of the cameras they recommended have an AV port to connect it to a T.V.I paid less for this camera purchased thru Amazon than what it costs at Wal-Mart.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product great buy", "Author": "R.

I was really excited about it, my first camera and all, but I quickly noticed cons about it.The camera looks pretty nice, and as far a portability, it is a nice small camera with a wrist strap.  But, the first wrong thing I noticed was that the battery wore off really quickly.  At first, I discovered somehow it was turning on by itself in my camera case.  I don't know if it was because the top of the case pressed down on the button or it turned on by itself, but a lot it was on when I took it out, so I thought that was the reason the battery kept dying, so I was more careful not to accidentally press the button while in the case.But that wasn't the cause.  As I used the camera further, it got worse and worse.What it does is it just turns off.  Rarely it has one battery bar, but usually it displays full battery.  But then it just turns off, and whenever I try to turn it on and it says \"dead battery\".  It won't work for another at least 24 hours.  But when it turns on, it says full battery.This is really frustrating, the biggest problem with the camera.  I missed lots of picture taking from it.A few more smaller problems are that when you are taking a video and zoom in or out, it doesn't record.  Sound.  SO if you are wanting to take a video and zoom in and want all the sound, this isn't gonna work for you.  And, the pictures just aren't good quality.  They are cheap and unprofessional looking, especially with flash.On a lighter note, there are some pros.  There are lots of settings to take pictures with, such as normal, negative, black and white, forest, cool, warm, sepia.  And, it has settings such as beauty shot, self portrait, children, beaches, and landscape.  It holds tons and tons of pictures.  You could take about, hmm, 800 pictures, I think, before the memory card is full.Well, that's the review, and there's not much you could do well with this camera.  It's a good camera, weighed down by cons.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R34TA8VT38TDRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a great camera!  In fact, it's so good, I just had my second one stolen, within a year!!  So, don't set it down anywhere!Seriously, this is a very good quality camera with many different features.  My best advise is to buy an 8MB card with it.  That way you can take a ton of pictures with no hassles.  I've also shot some short videos with it.  Nothing of a pro quality, the sound isn't great but, it's still fun.I highly recommend this camera, great price, great pictures, great features, very good lens and all about the size of a cigarette pack!", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "wonderful product!", "Author": "Cassia R.

Apparently if a piece is not properly attached and falls off such that the camera is no in one piece, it is \"physical damage\" is not under warranty.

For me i rarely got blurry pictures. However if you are a photographer the focus on this camera is not the best. I was obsessed with this camera! and for the girls it has a great feature called beauty shot which covers blemishes and makes you look amazing! this camera is really great and has great features! It's also very quick with taking pictures but one thing it would do that would annoy is that it says processing for a couple seconds after you take the picture then shows you it but after a while you get used to it.Now i really loved this camera, but it broke so easily! one day i was taking a picture and the zoom lense came out and then the screen went black and th camera froze. I tried everything, but nothing worked! so finally i sent it in with my warranty and the said it broke because there was sand in it...i don't live anywhere next to a beach nor have i taken it to a beach so we told them that then they changed it to soil. I was very protective over my camera and wouldn't let people touch it i always had it in a case and kept it away from any substance that could harm it so if some how a little soil managed to somehow get to my camera and break it it's not durable what so ever! and in order to fix it it coasts about the same as how much we bought the camera for so i had less than a year with my camera that i so dearly loved and i reccomend it however not for the aspiring photographers out there", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!", "Author": "Christal Davis", "ReviewID": "RCU77UQ17ZTG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and used it for about a year before I, unfortunately, broke it.

She used it almost every day and loved taping videos with it. Over the summer she had so much fun with her friends taping skits they would make up. Her friend dropped it once and the lens was left in a tilted position which my husband fixed and it was on to photos and videos once again.Toward the end of summer, little 5 year old sister threw the camera against the wall and from then on the telephoto lens would not adjust. I thought about sending it for repair but thought buying a new one would be a better idea.I ordered this one from Amazon and gave it to her in November for her 11th birthday. She is so happy to be a photographer again.The pictures are great, videos good and it is a tough little camera.
