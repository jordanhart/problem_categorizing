My lenses also date from that time.The manual was not very helpful in figuring this out.  It does require a setting change and one can shoot in only manual focus mode with aperture priority.

What an amazing little imaging machine. It is small, fast, and, although I have tried to fool the meter with strong backlights and partial frame lighting, I have been unsuccesful.

I chose Pentax as several newer film cameras, lenses and flash units I own are all Pentax.  The flash units, and lenses for Pentax autofocus, autoexposure (KAF mount) 35mm cameras are interchangeable on the *ist DL, a huge plus!  I love knowing I can use AA batteries, CRV3 batteries or an AC adapter (on order).The DL is a joy to hold, the weight is less than my ZX-Ls and the ergonomics are even better.  A couple of competitors' cameras that I have handled afterwards actually felt clunky to me. The LCD viewfinder is great (please let it be known, to save battery life it will time out much sooner than many folks are accustomed to with digi pocket cameras).  The multifunction dial for auto shooting, or manual settings is pretty muchthe same as other models I have, cutting down the time I needed to read the manual.  The \"slim\" filter feature is a unique feature to Pentax units I believe.The kit lens is sharp and clear, and the equivalent to a 28-80mm lens in 35mm format, which suits most of my needs.  The DA lens does not have an aperture ring, so those of us so accustomed to having one must learn to use the electronic settings (or use an earlier lens, on aperture priority).  A few drawbacks I have read about the DL is that for sports/action use the autofocus may not be fast enough for some guys, and the AF360FGZ flash (I have one)does not swivel.  I can get around those items; to me a big plus is that's been reported that Pentax digitals have less noise than many competitors at higher ASA/ISO settings, enabling you to use it in low light situations with less noise (I still want to call it \"grain\") in your images.  As soon as the weather improves, I am going to really see what this baby can do beyond the test pics I have taken indoors.A great camera to learn digital SLR photography with, just as the old K1000 was for 35mm.", "Date": "March 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Pentax *ist DL camera", "Author": "M.

I used to be a point and shoot user and get hooked on Nikon for their outstanding design and vivid pictures. Starting from Nikon 3100, 4600, eventually a 8700, I have tried to shoot in various circumstances and tried to convenience myself that a PS camera is good enough.  However, I never felt satisfied.Before actually purchase the *1st, I have also kept an eye on Nikon D70s, Canon Rebel XT, and even D50. Tried all the models in Circuitcity and BestBuy but didn't feel they were the types I was looking for.  I felt strongly against Canon since their covers and rubs felt cheap and the silver color always remind me of the point and shoot cameras.I eventually decided to purchase the *1st when Pentax offered a $[...] rebate on the camera body.  The operatons of the camera is extremely identical to a film SLR camera, and the camera takes in  most AF and K mount lens, which actually save a leg while upgrading the system.  I purchased a old lens (28-200mm) from ebay for less than $[...]and it worked with the *1st without any problems.Another good thing is the AA batteries used on the camera.  You can purchase 4 AA rechargable Energizer batteries on Amazon for less than $[...].

I then persued a DSLR, did tons of research, shopping around, and came down to this. If you take advantage of the manual controls, photos that surpass point-and-shoot. The AF is amazing, 100% accurate (so far). It has a nice range of controls to get creative with, which are conveniant and \"right there\". Noise at ISO 1600-3200 is acceptable. Fast and responcive. Value. RAW conversion software very simple and right down to the point (and advanced adjustments too).Cons:If you are switching to DSLR from digital point-and-shoot, it may take a bit of time to get comfortable with having to use the viewfinder all of the time. Not numorus, but only a few times the AF did not lock and release the shutter. I am not  optimistic with the auto white balance. Info in the viewfinder (shutter speed, apature, and so on) not so easaly seen when it is really bright outside (not a big deal to think any less positive of the camera).Final opinion:Amazing camera when you do not swich it to AUTO.

Honestly, did not even consider pentax in my research, and just to see how the rebel and d50 looked and felt,  I visited a 'camera store' and asked the sales person for these models. I also asked her for her recommendations, and she sneaked in this lovely little camera. The pentax surprized me as a package.It was a delight to hold, felt perfect in my small hands and then after a couple of weeks of more research,  where nobody complained about the picture quality or the quality of the product, I knew this was it.I will not go into the specifications as they can be found on a zillion websites and for sure this camera 'lacks' certain features but which one doesnt unless you have $$$$ or more.In the past two months, this camera has been to numerous  hiking trips and I have always got great pictures back. It has 'survived' a few raindrops as well occasionally when the clouds caught me unprepared with my backpack,  but I would not recommend taking any chance with that.As a beginner, an SLR does have some initial learning curve involved and be prepared to ruin some shots if you forget to change the white balance, or other settings. I have just started using raw, and realized the advantages.Almost everything is good about the camera. But it does seem to underexpose a little on the auto modes.Also there are not many lenses made specifically for this camera by pentax unlike canon/nikon. I am not considering third party or older pentax lenses here. This might be a drawback. But I feel that unless you want to go professional, the choices are adequate.To sum this review, I feel this camera is a great entry level SLR which is easy to use, nicely built , delivers quality results an on a budget. I also got a couple of adobe photoshop manuals, which I feel is a wonderful tool along with my camera. Thank you !", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Value, convience, and easy of use!

Why is that? The Pentax *ist DL delivers everything that the Nikon D50/D70 and other cameras in its class do, and for hundreds of dollars less. The camera's functions are intelligently laid out so that you can begin shooting great photos right away, and the manual is well-written and organized, making it easy to learn when you're ready to explore everything the camera can do. The kit lens is better than what ships with some competitors, and the camera is compatible with most older Pentax lenses, making it possible to save hundreds by buying used lenses rather than having to sink money into new digital lenses. Another great feature is that the camera runs on AA batteries, unlike some cameras which use proprietary batteries.The camera has the capability to shoot RAW files and Pentax includes a disc with basic RAW processing software. Photoshop CS2 is probably a better choice for those who will be shooting many RAW photos.One thing I feel compelled to mention is that shooting in any of the auto modes yields photos that are highly color saturated, and this setting cannot be changed. This isn't a gripe as the photos are easily corrected in after-processing in Photoshop.To sum: there's really nothing NOT to reccommend about this lovely little machine.

Ryan \"Dallasdux\"", "ReviewID": "R3DHDJ4IV62BFB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a great buy.  Pentax does not have the market presence (not advertising enough) that Canon & Nikon have and even Sony, who purchased Konica Minolta's camera division, will probably advertise more than Pentax. BUT, this *ist-DL is a great camera and for the price, in regards to entry level dSLR's, it can't be beat. Plus Pentax has been running a [...] rebate to make it a relative steal compared to the competition.Professional Reviews state it well. Basically, Pentax is not the leader in any specific camera technology, but instead, it does almost all of those same things 'very well' and for a lower cost.  Doing the initial research, I was worried about availability of lenses.  Those worries were quickly put to rest as I found plenty of new lenses avaialbe in the market from leading manufactures and the great thing about Pentax (K/KA bayonet mount) models is that the *ist-DL accepts all those old lenses.  So, I've got a collection of new and old lenses and all types of ranges.  You can find some great deals on auction sites for older lenses, and the new ones are in the same price range with the Canons & Nikons.Okay, so the camera....I've been very happy with it and it is my first dSLR.  I chose it based on 1) Price  2) Already had Pentax lenses  3) Professional Reviews.  It does everything I could want and I'm learning my new hobby quickly.Functions are easy to use, large LCD, good image clarity are all plusses.  Use 4 AA Duracell rechargeables (2650's) and I've taken over 400 shots without having to recharge yet (about time to do so now).  Only minus(es) are: Shutter is a little loud, Auto Focus in Dark settings is a little slow, and local chain camera stores don't carry much for Pentax (online yields plenty plus best prices).", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Really Great Digital SLR at a Nice Price", "Author": "J.

I am used to Pentax LX, MX, ME, and K-1000 35mm cameras and (a huge collection of) M-series and A-series lenses, along with Rolleiflex medium format.  Some tripod work, but mostly hand-held.  I hike a lot (photos:  landscapes of all sorts, natural details, sky drama) and also take candids of family and friends outdoors and indoors (the 50-200 zoom is great for candids.)I had basically stopped doing any photos except business work and snapshots with a 2MP digital ELF (Canon Powershot 110).  The ELF was fine for basic snapshots but has very little flexibility.Since my wife gave me this camera a year ago, I've re-discovered the fun of making photos.

I had always liked pentax and still enjoy many pics from my ME Super. For my first digital slr, of course I had to consider the pentax. I decided to buy it because of the interchangeable lenses.The pictures were nice and I was getting used to it.Then I attached a 60-300 lens that I used on my old ME Super. It would not come off. I figured these things sometime happen.I called pentax and the customer service person told me since the lens worked on my ME Super, to remove it would be covered under my warranty.I downloaded the forms and sent the camera off to Colorado.After I sent an inquiry, a person from pentax called me at home to explain that I should be able to understand that they couldn't warranty removing a  lens that was not a pentax lens ! It was only a pentax mount.(?)I said I bought the camera because it accepted pentax mounts and I expected the camera to be able to release them. The lens worked on the camera, but just would not release.The pentax person told me the best he could do was to give me a coutesy discount. $22.50 off .Charges were $157. My shipping was $17.50.The warranty was useless, the camera is not worth the money, and I will not buy another pentax product again.(Thanks, amazon, for letting me vent.)", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice but already replaced", "Author": "Gadget geek", "ReviewID": "R3IFJ3GJKOWC5V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pentax has already replaced this model with an upgraded version.
