Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but it's performance amazes me.  I absolutely love the smile shutter.  It automatically takes the picture right when it detects a smile :)! I love the features that come with it such as the scrapbook feature and the feature that allows you to fix/adjust your pictures right on the camera (I don't need to upload the picture -> open photoshop cs -> and adjust the size and discoloration of my pictures, now I can do it right on the camera before I upload them!) I have to say, Sony you finally came out with a camera that I fell absolutely head over heels with. <3", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Too complicated", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RYNOLM23YA94N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love camera's and am always looking up the newst ones and buying the new fad.
