For the price, I wasn't expecting outstanding pictures and this camera is adequate. It does need a louder \"beep\" when the shutter button is pressed, sometimes I don't know that a picture was taken or not until I look. Other than that I have no problems with it and would recommend it as a camera to use for quick snapshots where high resolution isn't needed. Think of it as one of the 'disposable' film cameras you can get in stores.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sure to disappoint", "Author": "Oakie", "ReviewID": "R38531WHKS2OBS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for elementary school student use in a computer lab. I need 8 cameras so I bought one of these to see if it would be simple enough for use by 2nd graders.Here are the postives:The camera is small and would fit small hands perfectly.It uses only two AAA batteries.The controls are few, simple to use and I believe would be simple to teach to youngsters.The buttons have a nice  clicking tactile feedback.The viewing screen is plenty big to see what you're taking a picture of.You don't need any of the software provided to transfer pics to the pc, just use the cable or memory card.There is a tripod mounting spot on the bottom.The flash works just enough to add fill light at close 3'-5' distances.The negatives:If you take 10 pictures, 8 of them will be blurry every time.Most of the sharp pictures will only be sharp if taken in bright light.After you take the 10 pictures, you need new batteries. Keep a pocketfull around at all times.No matter what the adverts say, you must have a memory card to take pictures.It feels too light, as if there is nothing inside of substance.I feel the value of this camera should be closer to 7.99 so you would know it's junk by the price.You really can't hold it still enough, press the shutter lightly enough or find any other technique to consistently get sharp pictures. Youeventually come to the conlusion that its not you taking bad pictures, its this toy masquerading as an optical device.Realistically this thing should not be marketed on shelves in packaging, it should come inside cereal boxes wrapped in cellophane. This way you at least getsome food and some value, and you realize that you will eventually toss this in the landfill where it belongs with the wind up rubber band car that comes with the other cereal boxes.Don't buy this. Go to ebay and buy a used good camera for the price of this coco puffs reject toy.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Small, light, cellphone camera quality, digital zoom only", "Author":

Notice how there is *NO* sound in the video, and you can digitally zoom in steps.This is a very basic digital camera, akin to the 5MP cameras you see on current-gen smartphones, but actually with fewer features, such as very few controls over image quality (e.g., no white balance setting) and the lack of sound (!!!) in video mode.The features it does have include:- 5.1 megapixels- 4x digital zoom -- no optical zoom- using 2 AAA batteries- using SD memory card up to 32GB- a self-portrait mirror, akin to those found on various cellphonesI bought mine at my local Walgreen's store for under thirty, and I think that's the most you should pay.  I got it to keep in my car, for emergencies and accidents.The build quality reflects the price, and the image quality is very similar to that of most current-gen smartphones. The video quality, at VGA and QVGA, is surprisingly decent, but the lack of audio recording is a big problem.In short, this is a camera you'd like to keep somewhere for very occasional use only; after all, your cellphone may take as good or better pictures and videos.  It's small and lightweight and its use of AAA batteries makes recharging unnecessary.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Warning:  This is a toy camera.", "Author": "Curious Mark \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "RYQ3ZLCLN11LB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Warning:  This is a toy camera.  You cannot set the date and time, and the internal clock does not advance when power is off.  So all of your photos will always have the wrong date and time.  The photo software is not included on the CD that comes with the camera; you have to be connected to the internet when you put the CD into your computer, and wait for the program to download (forever with dialup).  The camera has anti-shake, but it defaults to anti-shake off.  It is difficult to snap a picture without shaking the camera severely, and ruining the shot.  At night you cannot see anything in the viewfinder, so you have to take your best guess when aiming.  The flash does not compensate for distance from the subject, so most night shots are too bright or too dim; terrible results for night photography.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's a 20 Buck camera, have fun with it!", "Author": "John S.

If you shoot in low light, you will need to keep it very steady.  But held steady, the lens is surprisingly sharp for a fixed focus model. The default for flash is OFF, and the beeping is very quiet, making it a good choice for grab shots or street photography in daylight. Again, for $20 plus the cost of a card, it's tough to complain. The (standard shaped) USB cable would cost almost half that if you needed to buy one.  And it does videos!  Great for \"art\" photography and good for kids.  I wish it took AA batteries, which last longer. If you are more the Ansel Adams type, pass on this.  If you are more of the Andy Warhol type, LOMO and Holga type, try it.

None of the pictures are in order because the camera always believes it's midnight on Feb 8 every time it's turned on.The video has NO SOUND and the quality makes it look like we used an old-fashioned movie camera.I'm very disappointed in this purchase, mainly because my son has been so diligent about capturing all the Christmas and New Year's activities we've done and the pictures are awful.  I'm going to buy him a real camera now, but I can't get those moments back for him.I never worried about the included software for downloading pics to the computer.
