{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Soooo disappointed!!", "Author": "Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1HUZ99V20QSTE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So very disappointed in this product... thought that it being the Polaroid brand it would be a good 1st camera for our 7 yr old twin girls and boy was I wrong!  Description is extremely inaccurate as it would only take 14 pics before saying it was too full... didn't even bother trying to download the pics to the computer to see the quality.  It felt very cheaply made, no substance whatsoever to the camera itself, and ate batteries like they were going out of style.  Have returned these cameras (bought 2) and will see if I can find them something better... these were birthday gifts and my girls were quite bummed!!", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Polariod Camera", "Author": "Red", "ReviewID": "R1ZAF67T7T0T0G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera itself is really really small and the LCD screen is hard to see. Basically, when you take a picture you can't even see clear what you just took a picture of and the picture doesn't get saved. I gave my camera to my niece. In my opinion, it is great for a young child to play with but not for teenagers or adults.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Its an ok first camera I got it for my 9 year old.", "Author": "barryjessica", "ReviewID": "RGNU69SZK8VBY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my daughters 9th birthday and downloaded the pictures today. The photoes are a little grainey in some of the pics outside are ok.

I actually bought two of them.  One for my son and one for my daughter.  They are so bad and take such poor quality pictures that you can't even tell what they were aiming at.  My husband and I tried taking pictures to see if it was just a problem with technique and ours were not any better.  I sure hope I can return these tomorrow....we bought very little for our kids this year for Christmas and what a disappointment these were after they were opened!I rarely write reviews, but wanted to warn others to stay away from this hunk of junk...it's not worth $5.00.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very cheap camera", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R2N96X2ZO64GV4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My dad bought this for my 2 and 1/2 year old son to play with since he always wants to play with our electronic stuff like cell phones and cameras.  We knew it would be a cheap camera but the quality was far worse than we expected.  It's made of very thin feeling plastic and the lid that holds the batteries in always pops open because the tabs that hold it down are not strong enough. The LCD screen is horrible, looks like it has about 8 colors.  Only holds 20 pictures, and picture quality is poor and are usually blurry unless you hold the camera perfectly still.  It makes a good toy for our 2 year old, he likes to press buttons on it and hear it beeps and thinks he is taking pictures, but it should be labeled as a toy and not a 2MP digital camera. Our 10 year old 2MP Kodak takes 10 times better pictures than this thing.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Compact unique design!", "Author": "Rhegie", "ReviewID": "R2N5K4M82V2DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is very light, compact design and can fit inside a coat pocket, shirt pocket and pouch bags!

Every picture is red, dark and grainy...even when using the joke of a flash. I bought this for my son and we're both very disappointed. He has the cheapest cell phone on the market and even IT takes better pictures than this camera. I expected much better from Polaroid.
