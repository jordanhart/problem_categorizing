{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than a Nex,? Maybe..", "Author": "Radio Man \"yarns13\"", "ReviewID": "R10J3VKUXTCEXN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung NX300 is a great little camera. Seems many of the pros or semi pro photographers haven't talked much about this camera YET. Might be because admittedly, Samsung up till this point was not exactly held in the same company as a Sony Nex or Canon, Nikon, Fuji..etc. Well..seems to me, Samsung is becoming a player here or soon will be, in my OPINION. I formed this opinion as I presently own TOO many cameras :)..among them being the Fuji X100S, Sony RX1, had a Nex7..had an EM5. Anyway my crazy camera buying habits aside I am able to compare all these cameras. More specifically, what I love about the Samsung is it's incredible accurate color. Skin tones look GREAT as does grass, foliage, anything etc..Looks on my screen EXACTLY as colors look in real life..of course making sure White Balance is correct. It's auto WB by the is among the best I have seen so far in all the cameras I mentioned prior btw, in many different lighting conditions. Of course you can choose custom WB if you are in difficult lighting. One thing that is not great, but not too bad are it's write times to the sd card vs ready for next shot or to preview the picture. It's NOT slow at all..but probably a little slower than the Nex cameras and my x100s..but again NOT bad, just not a rocket.One plus here vs any Nex I have used..this NX300 lets you choose incremental iso. If you may not know what that means..all Nex cameras can only MANUALLY do iso 200/400/800/1600/3200 and so on..This Samsung like most BETTER cameras, DSLRS, etc. you can choose in-between isos be it 640...or 2000. That may sound like not much, but consider the fact MAYBE all you need is iso 2000...on a Nex your only choice will be to jump to iso 3200 if 1600 is not enough...so you simply have MORE control here..and potentially lower iso noise than a Nex because of this silly little SHOULD have feature. :)Apparently this really does have a brand new sensor despite it being the same exact pixel count as the older NX cameras. I find it's iso to be rather useable up to about 2500 even 3200. That said there is one huge flaw with this camera, Noise reduction kicks in way too much on isos above 400 or low light, and it's a shame because shooting raw you will see the higher isos on this camera are really really great, low noise..with very tight grain..once it starts to creep in. Book short I'd put the high iso capability to be just a notch or TWO better than the EM5 and a notch below the X100S as far as noise goes..again I'm talking about raw. Jpegs look AWESOME in good light but yes..NR is too aggressive once iso gets kicked up..I hope they will fix that in a firmware update. Oddly the Samsung DOES let you control the NR levels but not till you reach 6400 iso..so 3200, 1600 iso etc..you are stuck with aggressive NR..The jpeg noise reduction is just about my only complaint.The lcd looks great MOST of the time...BUT in very strong sunshine I have to say it can get a little difficult to see detail on the display and a bit difficult to see your menu settings. :( I have deducted one star because as I say SOMETIMES you can't see what's going on too well on the display, in most light though like 90% of the time the display is rather good and useable. Of course a built in evf would be nice but this is not bad at all OVERALL. The touch screen is more than a gimmick, you can really get around the menus very fast. I should say I did end up buying the 30mm pancake lens..2.0 aperture. It does make a world of difference vs the kit lens..mine came with the 12-50mm lens..not bad, but just so so. With the pancake lens this Samsung really shines in low light..great bokeh, almost no purple fringing..really great lens.well that's another review. :)The focus accuracy and overall speed are above average. I like you can reduce or enlarge the focus box...same like on the Fuji. The camera is not quite OMD fast but maybe about as fast or faster than the x100s, faster and more accurate than my Nex 7 was. For those of you that don't have Light Room it comes with it, so the software is great obviously. That said LR 4.4 actually is not working correctly with the NX300 raws. I upgraded to LR 5.0 and it's just PERFECT...I believe this is a known issue..raws have some weird magenta thing going on with LR4 but it's fixed now with LR5...not to worry.With the pancake lens this camera really is pocket-able....yes a large pocket but it fits, REALLY. I can't say that about any Nex's...unless you buy the badly reviewed 16mm Sony pancake lens. The dynamic range seems to be above average for this type of camera..it's almost difficult to blow highlights..the EM5 will blow highlights much faster than this Samsung will.On the overall considering it's low price..this Samsung is a FANTASTIC little camera. I have NOT used any of the wifi or 3d gadgetry OR video..I don't do video on my cameras. I suppose if the wifi and 3D options are important to you that just puts this camera even in a better position to meet or beat any Nex out there.  Again I haven't shot any video so I can't comment on it. \"I do miss having a built in evf or even the fact you can't GET an evf for this camera\"..that's a real shame. But on the overall...even if you take away it's great price, this Samsung is ready to do battle with pretty much any mirrorless camera out there..again EXCEPT you might want to shoot raw, if you are using higher ISO due to it's too aggressive high iso JPEG Noise Reduction. Overall..this is a great camera and I'm surprised how much I am enjoying it. DEFINITELY worth a good hard look vs the competition..again in my opinion.. and NO it's no RX1 but it's about $2,000 less and it's not THAT far away vs the RX1 in picture quality once you pop a better lens on this thing! This is a fantastic little camera..it will surprise you!", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I finally found a camera that leaves me 100% satisfied", "Author": "John Hunter", "ReviewID": "R14A0UOSZCREKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made the following review of the white NX300 and just wanted to share it here since it's the same camera and lens...First off, if you want an extensive review of this camera go to cnet, dpreview, etc. That's where I head when doing research before buying a camera. This camera is an upgrade from my NX210 that I purchased last year. On my Amazon review of the NX210 I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars. I thought that the mediocre focusing system subtracted 1/2 star. After reading the positive reviews of NX300 and noting the several awards it already won I just had to have one. I decided on the white one and wow am I glad I did. It is one fantastic looking device. I was initially contemplating the more compact 20 - 50 mm kit lens but ultimately went with the 18 - 55 mm lens. The latter not only offers a wider focal length, but also features optical internal stabilization. I can definitely notice that the focusing system is an improvement over the NX210. It's the quickest, most accurate focusing camera I've ever experienced. I'm also happy to report that the focusing system is no longer audible during video playback. The articulated touchscreen is a nice upgrade as well. The touchscreen is responsive and makes the camera easier-to-use overall. Otherwise, it takes the same \"SLR quality\" photos the NX210 takes but with a much higher chance of being in focus. This is the first time I felt comfortable giving a camera five stars and recommending it to family and friends without hesitation.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great image quality, nice features, and excellent value.", "Author": "Bron \"Bron\"", "ReviewID": "R3A2BDJFLSVBND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Excellent image quality thanks to the APS-C sensor and the 18-55mm Zoom lens included.Excellent controls - among the best in my opinion.Compact design and good build quality.Beautiful AMOLED screen.Fast, reliable Autofocus.Fairly light, good grip (not the best ever, but good enough), handles well.8-9 fps shooting speed (very good considering the high resolution images)1/6000 shutter speed (fast, good for action)Overall value for the price is superb.Quick direct video and good video qualityCons:Battery life (get an external charger and some extra batteries)View screen not as fully adjustable as some (but adequate)You decide:No built-in flash (more compact body, not needed much of the time (e.g. landscapes))Small, shoe mounted external flash (more adjustable, but less convenient)Lots of digital image \"features\" - great if you like them and use them, fluff if not.My Review of the Samsung NX300I started my adventures with the Samsung camera line with the inexpensive WB150F model.  The wireless features impressed me and the camera itself was reasonably decent as well for the low price. So when I ran across the NX1000 which was then selling for less than 1/2 its original price. I gave it a look. I ended up purchasing one and so was introduced to Samsung's excellent APS-C sensor and lens line (20-50mm, 18-55mm OIS, 20mm and 30mm primes and the superb 16mm wide angle lens among others). The Samsung lenses deliver great results and are relatively low priced for their quality.Smart things Samsung has done with their camera line. Many models share the excellent APS-C sensor, though later models feature some firmware tweaks and other possible improvements, still the basic sensor is the same.  This means that the Samsung NX1000/1100 is one of the best values in a compact camera available on the market today. (See my review here: Samsung NX1000 White ~ 20.3MP Digital Camera with 20-50mm Lens.) In addition, many models share a line of batteries and compatible chargers, meaning you can buy spares and use them with your next model and/or share them among multiple cameras you may own. Many other accessories (like the EM-10 external microphone for video) can also be shared. This consumer friendly approach is something I really appreciate.They also have an innovative and excellent iFN function that allows you to very easily access and adjust key parameters using the lens focus ring as a control dial, or you can use the top control dial or menu buttons on the back as well. In the case of the NX300, you can even use the touch screen to select and drag to make adjustments.The Samsung camera menu system is fairly consistent throughout these various models as well. All of this means you can easily switch from one model to another, whether you're using multiple cameras or up-grading as you progress in your craft.So, when the top of the line NX300 appeared on the scene, I took notice. It brings some firmware improvements, the excellent APS-C sensor which delivers great image quality consistently, and the wonderful Samsung menu and control system. You have a touch screen, a top menu dial, the iFN and focus ring control dial function, as well as numerous dedicated buttons and a straight forward easy to understand and use menu system. If you are coming from another Samsung model, everything will be fairly familiar. If not, then you will be pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and great control. You can quickly adjust nearly anything and there are many customizations you can set to access your favorite controls and set-ups. All very well thought out and easy to use.The NX300 is light, compact and easy to grip.  The OIS (Optical Image Stabilized) 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom lens is compact and an excellent all around lens. It delivers good image quality and has a useful range of roughly 28-85mm in 35mm equivalent format. The lens zooms smoothly and focuses quickly. In fact, the Samsung Auto Focus system is quite snappy and overall operation of the camera is quick and precise. Besides the iFN button for quick access to manual controls, there is also a switch that allows you to easily change between auto and manual focus modes. This is a feature I like very much. I much prefer having that switch on the lens itself where I can easily 'thumb' it as needed.The iFN control allows you to use the focus ring to easily adjust shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation, white balance and extended zoom (depending on the mode you are in and how you may have customized the choices). I cannot possibly cover all the controls in this review, but they are extensive and well thought out. There is a rotary command dial on the top and a button for WiFI direct link as well as the mode selection dial and on/off and shutter release. There are ten more buttons plus the video control (you can shoot video instantly by pressing this button) on the back. Experienced photographers will appreciate these dedicated control buttons which make quickly accessing camera functions very easy. Much better than toggling through menu layers and choices when trying to capture images quickly. The Fn (function) button on the back gives quick access to a dozen of the most important camera functions available. In short, once you get used to your NX300 you will be able to quickly and easily shoot, allowing you to concentrate on your subject, composition, and other things rather than fighting with your camera to get it set up properly. On top of all of this, the touch screen is also active and intuitive and you can directly control many things using it as well. Usually there are multiple ways available and you can chose the method you prefer. Nice.I also like that Samsung kept the physical controls and did not try to go 'all touch' with the NX300. I'm fine with touch, but physical buttons are a superior form of control in my experience when you need to work quickly and precisely. In my opinion, this all adds up to make the Samsung NX300 one of the best designed cameras I've used in terms of access, control, and ease of use. (And certainly the best of the Samsung NX models.)The AMOLED screen is gorgeous and one of the best I have ever seen on a camera. Wonderful colors and contrast and very bright. It is also adjustable (not quite as nice as some which swing out completely, but more than adequate) so you can eliminate reflections or get a better angle when shooting.The APS-C sensor renders a lot of good image detail. This is a big plus for this camera. I am very pleased with the results I get. I shoot a lot of landscape and street stuff, and this camera seems well suited for that. The noise reduction seems to work well. Colors are accurate and not over-saturated like on many consumer cameras. If you like the \"boost\" many cameras give by default, there is a \"Vivid\" mode which will do this for you. Personally, I prefer the more realistic colors (one of the things I like about Olympus and (most) Panasonics as well). Sharpness is good in JPEGs (I have not shot RAW yet) and tones are nice and smooth (think large expanses of blue sky and clouds). I'm sure with experience my results will improve over my initial test shots, so that bodes well. If you like to print big as I do, say 16x20, you will be able to do so, which is very nice.The NX300 also shoots very good quality FULL HD 1080p video (mp4) at 24, 30 and 60 fps. There is an external mic available, but the built in sound is pretty good as is.The wifi features work well and it is fairly easy to send photos to skydrive, via email, and so on. You can also back up images to your PC. On my other Samsung cameras these features work very well and should work just as well or better on the newer NX300, but I have not yet had time to test them thoroughly. (I did test uploading to skydrive and sending pics via email and both worked very well.) I also have not tested the mobile app direct link functionality yet. (Will update when I do.)When setting up your network access, the touchscreen makes entering passwords, email addresses, and other data much easier.I will come back and continue to update this review as I have more experience with the NX300, but I am already very pleased with it and the results I am getting in early tests and casual shooting. I have not discovered any flaws or problems so far. It is a beautiful camera, fun to use, and with more bells and whistles than most will ever need.The key thing for me is handling and image quality and there the NX300 excels. I feel very comfortable giving it a full 5 stars, even at this early stage, for quality, design, features and value.2014-05-22 Update: After some time, my opinion remains that this is a 5 star camera and one of the best values you can find in a digital camera, currently. I have learned that the APS-C sensor in the NX300 is an updated chip with some nice enhancements that give the already stellar image quality a boost. They kept the same resolution and enhanced the circuitry and design. Nice! Certainly the image quality is excellent and there's a fine line of Samsung lenses to help you make use of it.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "technojunkie", "ReviewID": "R3G0N2NUL1HR6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always \"dabbled\" in photography, but never had a DSLR. A friend was so excited about this camera that I just had to check it out an am very glad that I did! eatures are great and the variety in lenses by Samsung is also very good. The camera has features that are too numerous to mention including being able to crop the picture right there on the camera make some image corrections and email it someone (through wifi). The camera is quite light and feels weird with the 50-200mm zoom lens zoomed in all the way. The amoled screen is to die for (but don't, you have too much to live for). One really nice feature is the wireless functions. I haven't tried with an iPhone yet but I have both a Samsung note3 and the 10.1 inch note tablet. You can use either as a remote viewfinder/shutter release and touch focus device! Now you can take a \"proper\" selfie! The camera creates it's own wifi network and you use the Samsung smart camera app. You see realtime video streamed from the camera and if you touch your phone it autofocuses the camera (very cool) and you can use the phone as a shutter release as well. You can also quickly and easily transfer pictures directly to your phone or tablet. I love shooting some pics then sending them to my note 10.1 tablet for viewing. Very convenient and the transfers are SUPER fast. You can also transfer pics from your phone to the camera but I'm not sure why you'd want to. I purchased the 30mm pancake lens which (like others) I have fallen in love with! it's a great \"about town\" fast lens with great low light performance. Although it isn't a zoom, you can crop your pictures and still retain some amazing detail (I was personally stunned with the cropped quality). It's my understanding that you don't need high megapixels if you're not printing very large pictures, but I think the pixel density really does make a difference for cropping pics. Extra batteries are cheap as is an external charger (get them as this thing seems to eat up batteries). Don't worry if you're just getting into this type of camera as it has a number of smart functions for figuring out what kind of shot you're taking so if you don't know your ISO from a hole in the ground don't worry about it. the camera does have a flash but it attaches to the hot shoe on top (no built in). it's super easy to check for the sharpness of the pic you just took by hitting the play button and double tapping the photo which zooms it about 7x (very useful to be sure you got a good shot and very quick to do).By the way, if you have a Samsung phone for connecting to the camera make CERTAIN that your wifi function is NOT set to AUTO NETWORK SWITCH!  Mine was turned on and what happened was the phone would find the camera's wifi network and immediately give an error message saying \"internet connection is too slow\" and drop the network again. I spent an hour on the phone with Samsung until I figured out the solution by myself (Samsung techs tried to help but they didn't understand the problem either). Go to your wifi setting on the phone and then hit the menu button on your phone and choose \"advanced\" and then clear the auto network switch checkbox. As soon as I did that, boom! the phone found the camera and connected flawlessly and quickly every single time.I'm not 100% certain but I think if you email photos directly from the camera it compresses them, but if you send pics to your phone first, they are the original file size which you can then email from your phone.for the money I just can't see anyone getting a better camera. That said, if you want to buy really good \"glass\" plan on spending more than the camera (but I think that's true of all DSLRs). The Samsung macro lens is like 500 bucks and their premier portrait lens (the 85mm primary) is like 800. So far I'm loving this camera and it has gotten me excited enough to start learning more about digital photography and learning how to take better pictures. If you take crappy pictures with this camera its going to be YOU not this camera!BTW if you want something supertelephoto for like nature shots or stalking that woman who just won't return your calls (kidding, i'm kidding), something that you can goof around with without taking out a 2nd mortgage on your home you can get the Samyang (not Samsung) 500mm telephoto F8 (manual focus) lens with a 2x teleconverter to give you a 1000mm lens. It's basically like sticking a telescope onto your camera. It's only like 135 bucks here on amazon so don't expect to be taking sports illustrated cover photos at your next football game. I haven't received mine yet but i'll write a review after I get it. If you want a zoom lens that will work properly with the NX line of cameras Samsung's longest lens is the 50-200mm zoom which is nice and also affordable. There is rumor of Samsung planning a 70-400mm lens but that's all I've heard so far. This probably wasn't a helpful review for \"Real\" camera guys, but if you're stepping up from a point and shoot fixed lens camera I hope my review helped a bit. If you have other questions I'll try to answer as best I can. Happy shooting!Update: you can't transfer pics from your phone to the camera (which didn't make sense anyhow).  The camera let's you choose which pics to transfer from the camera toThe phone but you can select pics using either the camera screen or via the phone screen.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic little camera.", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R3GVM9E437PLJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've received this package and I have been playing around with the camera.

I also recently purchased the Samsung NX2000 which  has a lot of similar features. I would share the features I like about the NX300 camera and include some comparison with the NX2000 in this review.What I like about this product- Compact and light weight as compared to the DSLR cameras with interchangeable lens. The camera body weighs about 12.5 oz  and fits easily in  a small camera case such as the Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera case.- nice bright and vivid 3.3\" flip-out touch screen which makes it easy to view  even under bright light situations. It is also quite easy to navigate the various on-screen functions and photos / video viewing- nice picture quality supporting upto 25600 ISO and a shutter speed of 1/6000 sec. The 15 - 55 mm lens works well for many photo-shooting situations with a phase-detection focusing system which provides  better and faster focusing. The lens also comes with the OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) function which is helpful for shooting fast moving objects. The lens's thread diameter is 58 mm in case if you want to purchase filters for it. This package also comes with a lens hood..- a variety of controls for the more advanced photographers. Some of the features I like included the focusing / exposure / metering modes, bracketing by exposure / white balance, and manual adjustment of the flash's power. The camera also comes with a neat feature called \"beauty face\" which automatically smoothen the skin tones either in real time or applied after the picture is taken.- wireless Wi-Fi capability. This is a function which I like very much. It works flawlessly for sharing the pictures with the Samsung Smart camera apps, e-mailing photos, and uploading photos to face book. An existing Wi-Fi connection is needed for the files sharing and transfer. The Samsung smart App also has a remote view-finder function which allows us to remotely control the camera using our smart phones.- regarding comparison with the NX2000. Both cameras use the same electronics sensor mechanism and provides very similar pictures quality.  The sharper flip-out display for the NX300 is a sure winner as it is  a lot easier to view even in bright light situation. The NX2000 has a larger 3.7\" screen and is about 3.5 oz lighter. The NX300 uses a control knob for selecting various shooting mode / functions whereas the NX2000 uses the touch screen for selecting the modes and functions. The NX300 uses the standard size SD memory card whereas the NX2000 uses the micro-SD card.Overall, I am very pleased with this camera given its price with nice picture quality, compact design with interchangeable lens , and the wireless sharing capability.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera and great looking", "Author": "Dr. Oceanfront \"Oceanfront\"", "ReviewID": "R1VRN1CWB4WO5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the look of this camera...it brings back memories of my old photography days!  It is so aesthetically pleasing, not very heavy and comfortable to hold.Normally, as I am always carrying my smartphone (IPhone 5s) I use that to take pictures.

Nowadays many digital cameras even have wireless network cards in them, making it even easier to transfer the photos to your PC or the cloud \u2013 as if connecting a cable or inserting the memory card in your computer was difficult.The Samsung NX300 20.3MP CMOS Smart WiFi Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 18-55mm Lens and 3.3 AMOLED Touch Screen (Brown) is a good-looking camera. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing in shape, but the color is attractive as well. The shape and weight of this camera feel good in the hand, too \u2013 not too heavy and not too flimsy.Setup is easy \u2013 providing you have a memory card handy. This camera does not come with one, and there are many features you simply cannot configure until you install a memory card \u2013 most notably the wireless configuration. You can use SD (Secure Digital), SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity), SDXC (Secure Digital Xtended Capacity), UHS-1 (Ultra High Speed-1), microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC, or microUHS-1 memory cards with it. I bought the B00E83XHXM and it works very well with this camera.Once I installed an SD card, configuration went smoothly. Setting the date, time, picture format, was pretty straightforward and intuitive. The wireless settings, however, seemed to be missing from the menu, so I checked the manual. It turns out the dial on top of the camera has a Wi-fi setting. You have to turn the dial to that position before you can configure the wireless connection or use the wireless features.When I first looked at the apps available in the Wi-Fi screen, I was disappointed that there were no apps for uploading files to Dropbox, SkyDrive, or Google Drive. The only option for uploading files to a cloud service was for Samsung\u2019s \u2018All Share Play\u2019. I went to that website, as directed by the camera, and found they no longer call it that. It is now Samsung Link. I\u2019m a bit surprised that a current camera model\u2019s options don\u2019t match what is available on their website. Once I registered for Samsung Link, I found that they actually aren\u2019t providing a cloud storage service. What they do is allow you to register either your Dropbox, SugarSync, or SkyDrive accounts there. Then when you upload files from the camera, it asks which of your registered services you wish to send them to. I am using my Dropbox account and uploading is easy and quick.You can also email yourself files from the camera. The email process compresses the photos a bit so that you aren\u2019t sending huge files via email. The resulting email has photos attached that still look really good.The camera really takes excellent photos and videos. I\u2019m really an amateur photographer, so I\u2019ve used the Auto feature so far. As I learn more about photography, I\u2019ll be exploring the manual settings more in depth. The auto feature will work very well for most amateur photographers.The NX300 comes with one 18-55mm lens, a rechargeable battery, a removable flash bulb, Adobe Lightroom f4, a micro USB cable and charger, and a camera strap. Although it supports adding GPS data to photos and videos as well as 3D photography, both of these features require purchasing accessories that do not come with the camera.One feature didn\u2019t make much sense to me when I first got the camera. The viewfinder has the ability to tilt downwards, away from the camera. I couldn\u2019t envision when this might be necessary. Then we went to Lane\u2019s Motor Museum in Nashville and I realized this feature was great for capturing photos inside some of the antique vehicles that were higher up. With the viewfinder tilted down, I could hold the camera over my head, pointing inside the vehicle, and still get an idea of what I was capturing before taking the shot. VERY nice.There are many accessories available for this camera, with a variety of lenses. The lenses often cost as much as or more than the camera itself, making this an unlikely purchase for the typical user who just wants to take some photos of family and friends occasionally. More serious and advanced photographers are the prime market for this camera.I\u2019ll update this review as I learn more about the camera. With its plethora of advanced features, this is one device that will take a while to really explore all of its capabilities to the fullest.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quick autofocusing with an excellent touchscreen makes me very happy... (links to other website reivews in comments section)", "Author": "AverageGuyShopper", "ReviewID": "R3IOWFUHBHM16T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a mostly-Canon-using  photographer in the past, lately I've been transitioning over to other brands like Panasonic and Sony to get the best value/performance for my hobby.  Samsung never really entered my radar screen as a \"real\" camera producer before.  I have to say, though, that I'm pretty impressed by the NX300.  For comparison, I directly compared with my relatively recent Panasonic DMC G5 (not GF5) 16 MP micro 4/3 camera.  I also use a Sony RX100 MK II, as my true pocketable P&S; camera.  The Samsung has an immediate advantage of an APS-C size sensor, but that does not make the total camera.  I put in a Sandisk Extreme 32 GB card.  I take a lot of indoor shots and shots of my family with young kids, which to me, is one of the most demanding scenarios asked of a camera.Great in-depth reviews can be found at websites like: Imaging-Resource, PhotographyBlog, & Ephotozine (links posted in the comments section since Amazon doesn't allow links in reviews).So, I'm just going to write casually about my personal experience and impressions with this camera.  I'll start off my saying that I like this camera A LOT and have made it my new go-to camera when convenience doesn't make me pick up the RX100.* Build of Camera:  Pretty decent, with a nice metal top and buttons that are easy to press.  The on/off switch is sturdy and the touch screen is beautiful.  There is a small thumbgrip which is handy.  The movie button could be a little larger.  The full size hotshoe is a nice touch, but I'd rather have a built-in flash for convenience (the camera does come with a small hotshoe flash, though).  There is no EVF like the Panasonic, but more on that later...* Ease of Taking Pictures:  Very easy on AUTO, and yet there are plenty of options for manual control.  I have to say that the camera does a pretty good job on auto by itself, better than the Panasonic or the Sony.  The hybrid autofocus works really well, and focusing is very quick and accurate, outdoors and indoors, far away and close-up.  If you flip the lens to manual focus, the camera will pop up a 6x? PIP for more accurate manual focusing.  The camera is shot ready from a cold start decently fast.  The tilt screen is pretty handy, but I wish it did fold out for group photos.  You can download the Samsung Smart Camera App that'll help you get in the right position before the camera snaps the photo.* The Kit Lens:  ...is actually pretty good for a kit lens.  It's has OIS built in and the auto/manual focus switch is easy to get to on the left side.  The zoom and focus rings are pretty smooth and quick, especially important for video.  The Panasonic kit lens pales in comparison to this lens, especially the choppy and slow focus during video (I actually have to use the telephoto lens to get smoother video).* Quality of Pictures:  This is where the $ is and the Samsung does not disappoint.  I was pleasantly surprised how true to life the colors came out and the pictures are sharp.  The camera is also able to output very usable pictures even at high ISO settings.  I shoot in JPEG format only.  I have no time to edit, so I almost never bother to do RAW images.* Quality of Video:  I've forgone the camcorder a few years ago (just a pain to carry around) as cameras have gotten better and better at taking video.  The Samsung does a great job of video, much better than the Panasonic.  I think a large part of it has to do with the lens.  But the colors and smoothness of the video just seems overall better.  I also think the Sony RX100 does a great job with video considering its small footprint.  The longest video I've taken is around 12 minutes long, and I had no problems with lag/stuttering/writing to my SD card.  But  trying to take a picture in the middle of the video just stops the video entirely, so unless I'm doing something wrong, I don't think that is possible with this camera.* The Touchscreen:  I feel like I'm using my cellphone, it's that good.  Before I used to avoid using the touchscreen on cameras since they were often laggy, imprecise when detecting your finger, and had bad menu systems.  The NX300 screen not only looks awesome, but it works incredibly well -- just like using a tablet or cellphone with finger gestures to move and zoom.  Now I love to use the screen!  While I like EVF on the Panasonic, the Samsung screen makes me happier with the ability to see a much larger picture with better colors for composition and playback.  The screen menu system is well organized too.* Extra Knickknacks:  The WIFI feature is great if you'd rather ditch the ol'cable hookups.  I couldn't get the NFC feature to work with my HTC One cellphone however.  Also, the software that comes with the camera is pretty lame.  Unless you like Adobe Light Room 4 (there is #5 now ~$110 on Amazon), in which case you'll love this camera.  In terms of company stock programs, I am partial to Canon's ZoomBrowser EX for ease and quickness of use.  Updating the firmware on the camera (to version 1.2) was very easy.(If I end up getting the 3D lens, I'll try and provide an update...)", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Choice to replace my Nikon SLR", "Author": "Brett Danger", "ReviewID": "R2DVH1OXX0OIQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Nikon D3100 for several years now and it has been a great camera, however we aren't getting a ton of use out of it.  It is too big and bulky to take everywhere, plus my wife doesn't want to use it because she wants to share photos instantly and doesn't want to mess around in lightroom or iphoto.Based on that, I wanted to get a camera that would take as good of photos as my Nikon, but also have wifi built in so my wife can share.  I did a ton of research and wanted to spend around $500, I was initially looking at the Pansasonic Lumix GF6, but the micro four thirds sensor are smaller than my APS-C Nikon Sensor.  That made me consider the APS-C based Sony and Samsung camera.  I read a bunch of reviews and decided on the NX300 and love it so far.  The touch screen focusing really helps the wife take better photos, and the size is much more manageable then my SLR.  We have a 2 year old boy and the burst shooting really helps.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R387Z73U75CX7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just want to start off by saying that I have been a point and shoot Guy all my life and the last camera I purchased before this was in 2008, it was a Canon PowerShot A720IS.The Canon was regarded as one of the best if not the best point and shoot of it's time but in order to get a decent lower light or indoors picture it was difficult and sometimes a complete pain.  The colors always looked a little off too, green was too green and tan looked a little brown.  If you were not familiar with how to work a camera in general such as, white balance, ISO, basically MANUAL mode you had to take what you got and most of the time it was, meh.A couple weeks ago I was trying to take a few pictures of something I was trying to list on eBay and that's when I threw my hands in the air and said \"it's time to get rid of this worthless no picture taking POS!\".  It just couldn't even begin to capture how it looked in real life.  A week of research later, enter the Samsung NX300, after reading countless reviews on all different cameras and many YouTube videos on the Samsung NX300 it really looked like exactly what i wanted, small, interchangeable lenses, DSLR quality photos, easy to use and not that expensive.The thing I love the most about this camera is it truly is POINT AND SHOOT!!!  Even in low light!!  The auto focus is super fast and accurate.  The accurate colors and detail are SOOOO much better than the Canon.  Looking at the pictures I have taken is really almost like being there because they are so true to life in every way, they have depth, detail, beautiful colors and wonderful contrast.  Some people have been complaining about the display being too reflective in the sun on this camera but I have no issues with it, I just pull it out and tilt it down a little and the reflection is gone.I have never had a DSLR camera but I have seen many DSLR photos recently and over the years and this camera is so close if not equal in picture quality to my amateur eyes.  So for the small body, easy to use and fast menu system (Canon's absolutely sucked!) stunning pictures, and interchangeable lenses this is absolutely a keeper.  Plus its nice looking :)Edit: 3/272014I decided just for giggles to shoot a couple of photos with my nx300 and then with my HTC ONE phone which I thought had pretty good quality photos until the nx300 completely put it to shame in every aspect.  The cameras in phones haven't even caught up to a 2008 point and shoot Canon yet either. Pitiful... I also upgraded the SD card to the 32gb Samsung PRO and this thing is wicked fast now.  It doubled the amount of continuous shots and also the time it writes to the card from a standard SD card.  This is getting fun :)", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice, non mainstream APS-C camera", "Author": "Strohmian", "ReviewID": "R2LG2LRC98KV43", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "BUILD QUALITY: ***** (5/5)This camera is a beauty! The top looks like finely brushed metal, the front is covered in perfectly inlaid leatherette, and the body is styled slim but curvy (for the handgrip), with sparse buttons and few logos. If it said \"Leica\" instead of \"Samsung\", I'd have no reason to doubt it. The bottom of the camera is definitely made of plastic though, and the black kit lens and flash don't entirely match the retro look - still, this looks and feels great.TAKING PICTURES: **** (4/5)For my smallish hands, this camera is a perfect fit: slim and solid, but not too heavy, and as easy to hold with one hand as with two. The touchscreen has great colors (being OLED) and is very responsive, presenting an uncluttered view with quick access to parameters or goodies like touch- to- shoot. To my surprise, there is only one mode dial (P, A, S, M..) on the camera, and only one other dial - so if there are two things to set (like shutter and aperture in M mode, or shutter and exposure in the other modes), you have to press a \"shift\" button. A little odd, but workable.More annoying (and the reason to withhold one star) is the chatty menu system. When I so much as switch to a shooting mode, a full screen tells me what I just did (really, I know what \"A\" mode is for!), and this chattiness carries over to all settings: often, a popup would spring up and obstruct what I was just trying to read or adjust! Also on the minus side is that the screen is quite reflective and not easy to read out in bright sunlight.Focusing is a middle- of- the- road deal: better than most Point and Shoots, but not spectacular in its own class, and absolutely no match to a DSLR.PICTURE QUALITY: **** (4/5)The spec is great (20 Megapixel CMOS APS-C sensor), and I'd say the picture quality is .. okay for that class. To compare with other \"outsider\" (non- Oly/Panasonic) cameras, I think the Fujis - even the very cheap XA-1 - give more \"wow for the money\", but the Samsung is capable of decent quality pictures, too. In good to dimmer light, the photos look more DSLR- like (which they should), with great color and little noise.The sensor shows its weaknesses with higher ISOs and low light, and that is acerbated by a substandard in- camera JPEG engine. In general, it doesn't reduce noise well, and tends to oversaturate. Now all that said, JPEG low- light performance doesn't faze me all that much, because those should be shot in RAW anyway. And here's the best news of all:SOFTWARE: ***** (5/5)I've been corrected in other camera reviews: supposedly it's normal for $1000 cameras to come with awful software. I disagreed then, and Samsung shows how it's done: they include a full version of Lightroom 4. Of course it would be better to have a free Lightroom 5 in the box, but even V4 is leaps and bounds above what other manufacturers offer. On a side note, Lightroom 4 runs pretty nicely in a VirtualBox under Linux, whereas SilkyPix (Fuji and Panasonic's choice) just crawls. The NX-300 is perfectly supported of course: distortion or CA corrections are one- click, and it really does magic with RAW pictures (see customer images for an example). Big Thumbs up to Samsung for that move!WIFI: ***** (5/5)Most cameras have Wifi today, but the NX300 goes above common expectations, in good and bad ways. On the plus side, the Wifi can do 5Ghz, and there are many share options, ranging from email, over social media, to \"cloud\" and smartphone sync. On the somewhat eerie side, email doesn't need your server credentials (meaning, the pictures go to Samsung, who then sends it out on your behalf), and the camera informs you of available firmware upgrades (which is helpful, but a bit strange for a camera to talk home - maybe I just need to get on with the social crowd).OVERALL: **** (4/5)This is a very nice camera with great build quality, good picture quality, and lots of features. I think it'll please social medialites as well as more serious enthusiasts, and it comes with a copy of Lightroom 4 to take full advantage of the sensor's capabilities.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the old school design with what is my favorite compact mirrorless camera.", "Author": "C. Weaver", "ReviewID": "RH7HFCSMPUCHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our second Samsung digital camera. My wife has the all white NX1000 and I liked a lot about the camera. The NX300 may not have all the software features as the NX1000 but for my use I like the features it adds.The most obvious to those around you is the retro design. Some may find it a negative to wrap a best in class digital camera with something that looks like it could be 50 years old. But I like the style and it got my attention to look at the camera in more detail and I am glad I did.The autofocus is very quick and responsive. I still switch to manual focus for the closest macro photos and the super zoom focus assist provides fantastic control getting the detail I want sharp and clear with the 20.3 megapixel hybrid CMOS.As with most compact mirrorless designs the NX300 does not have a viewfinder included but the AMOLED touch screen display is easy to see in all but the most glaring sunlight. It also tilts out and allows you to use the camera down low or overhead with the screen angled for easy viewing, a full 90 degrees when facing up and a somewhat less than optimal 45 degrees facing down. I found the 90 degree tilt able to allow me to take a lot more candid photos as the camera rested on my chest so I didn't cause the subject to strike a pose whenever I pulled the camera up to my face. It also made super close ups of low subjects especially easy. No more crouching on the ground to look see the display. The display does NOT flip all the way around for \"selfies\" but I don't shoot many of those...The touch screen capabilities enhance the functionality by duplicating access to most controls that are also available with easy to use physical buttons on the back of the camera including: exposure compensation, direct video access, menu, function (Fn), display, autofocus, ISO, continuous shutter/timer, playback, delete and OK. One nice feature of the touch screen is focal point selection if you don't want to switch to manual focus or try to get the camera to select the right part of the subject in a difficult composition. While there are many way to set the camera up to get focus on the subject you want the touch screen selection is a great way to do it quickly on a day you are just taking quick shots and don't want to spend too much time changing camera settings. On the top of the camera is a welcome mode dial with P,S,A, and M modes as well as auto, a lens priority mode (i),  smart mode with built in effects and a Wi-Fi mode for sharing.The NX300 WiFi and NFC capabilities make it easy to transfer and share photos on the go. Email, post to facebook, remote viewfinder, all these functions are easy to use although typing in text for WiFI passwords and email addresses is a bit of a chore. Once connected the 802.11b/g/n Dual Band WiFi make transfers quick although sharing can downsize the photos to under 2MB each.After you transfer the photos to your PC you can use the included Adobe Lightroom 4, This is about a $100 value and is a superb post processing application that turns your computer into a digital \"dark room\" to tweak lightning, color, and add some neat effects. (Lightroom is not Photoshop which adds capabilities for changing content of a photo)The built in microUSB based charging is a really nice feature for on the go charging, No need to carry around a base plate and charging cord when you travel. However it also means no external charger to keep a second battery topped off as it takes a couple hours to fully recharge. Fortunately you can buy a charger with extra batteries.Low light photography is another strength of this camera with ISO up to 25600 although the kit lens is a bit slow at only f3.5-4.6 it does have with Optical Image Stabilization. If you need more light you will need to attach the included pop up flash. I was unable to notice any noise introduced up to ISO 3200.For action photos the shutter speed is up to 1/6000 and continuous shooting at 8.6 frames per second will capture some of the fastest action you will shoot although focus may not be able to keep up and close crops may show it was not ideal.The kit lens is a pretty good all around performer although as mentioned is is a bit on the slow side. 18-55 zoom with manual zoom dial, it is easy to use and compares to a DSLR rating of 28-85. If you can't quite get the zoom you want with this lens keep in mind the 20.3mp sensor will let you crop in closer with plenty of surplus resolution. When you select the (i) mode on the PSAM dial you can adjust the depth-of-field and use the intelli-Zoom function (digital zoom).While I use the NX300 primarily for photos, I have shot a few videos. Full HD 1080p H.264 mp4 with stereo sound look great. The articulating display makes it easy to make videos without holding the camera in front of your face. The autofocus had a bit of trouble with video but stayed on target with only a couple episodes of hunting when the scene changed. I try to remember to switch to manual focus once I set up the scene I want to shoot in case an unexpected subject crosses closer in frame. Transfer and editing on a PC is easy but no video editing software is included. You can also use a micro HDMI cable to connect directly to your TV.I am happy with my switch from DSLR to this mirrorless design. I miss my viewfinder but this camera adds a load of features in a small and easy to use package with what I think is a great design.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera (Samsung - best hidden secret)", "Author": "Salt", "ReviewID": "R2VP55RZWJZ68U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a smaller camera to a DSLR which can deliver similar to exact results.

For its compact appeal, lightness, range of frames, quality of imagery and the 20.3MP delivery, I'm seriously considering leaving my bulky SLRs at home when I'm out in the field. One pleasing quality is the sound of the shutter, it's an actual mechanism sound, not a digital soundbite of a shutter. I've not made close comparisons to a DSLR (yet) in regards to image quality, but I expect it to be be close (pixel for pixel), the sensor is only slightly smaller than a 5D mk2 and 21.6 MP at full density - that's amazing!

Even though I lose the auto focus and the ability to have live view from my phone or tablet, I found that the pictures are much better. So if you are looking to use old lenses, this camera works great. As for the build quality of the camera, it is pretty good. Obviously plastic all over, but not cheapy feeling. The camera works very well for the most part. I upgraded the firmware and since then I do get freezes and I have to pull the battery. I also shoot RAW, and sometimes when I take rapid shot pictures it will not save. I use a class 10 45MBps SD card, so I'm not sure of the issue. Video is great with this camera.

I had also considered the Sony Nex5-R, but after having a friend upgrade from that to the Nex6, I figured it was the way to go. I ultimately ended up with this camera due to the price point. There are a lot of differences between the cameras, but I will just list what I like and do not like about this camera.I like this camera for many reasons. First off, the learning curve was small. I've only ever owned point and shoot cams before, so this was definitely a step up. The menus are obvious, and easy to navigate, and it has a mode description function that tells you what each setting does, and in some cases, what its best uses are. Next, the image quality is superb. Even though the kit lens is lightweight and doesn't have the best glass, it really turns out some nice images in RAW quality. The lens, on a good note, is light, and the auto focus is fast and fairly quiet.Things I don't like about the camera (after 45 days of use) are, the screen is large, but isn't very bright and is hard to see in sunlight. The camera is also missing a viewfinder, which would have been a nice touch to set it apart from the NX2000. The wifi link on the camera requires a lot of back and forth between the app on your device and camera, which is kind of frustrating if the camera dips into power saver mode and drops the connection.Overall, the camera handles well and has a really awesome aesthetic to it. People comment on the cameras looks all the time, which is kinda sweet. So far, I can't say that I am regretting buying this camera, even though I miss the viewfinder. I think it's definitely better than lugging around a huge DSLR tho. I wouldn't be surprised if the next camera I buy is a mirrorless as well.

I am strictly an amateur/enthusiast who is branching from snapshots to more advanced and creative composition.  The kit lens (18-55mm f4-f5.6) isn't bad, but the 50-200mm f4/f5.6 takes it a step up.  I don't have as much use for a longer zoom than I thought I would, but there have already been a handful of situations where I could not have done without it.  I also have the 30mm f2 pancake, which has yielded some of the best images I have ever shot.The is the first camera that I have owned that does RAW images (SRW to be specific) and it comes bundled with Adobe Lightroom 4.  This in itself has been huge as I can get even more out of my images in post-processing.I bought this at a big-box retailer on an open-box clearance -- so I saved over 40% on the list price.  This was right after the NX-300M came out and as much as I like the idea of the more flexible LCD, it wasn't worth the extra several hundred to me.Before purchasing, I did a lot of Google searches to see comparisons between this and other cameras and the NX-300 always acquitted itself well against the competition.  Not the best, but definitely among them.Pros:- User interface.  Menu system is more intuitive than other cameras I have used and tested.- Touch screen- Fn button on back gives instant access to most important shooting parameters- iFn button on lenses (not all of them) also gives added flexibility in adjusting aperture, shutter speed, ISO for the shot with fewer button pushes- Bright, large LCD good in any condition except bright sunlight (see Cons)- Image quality on par with entry to mid-level Canons and Nikons -- in fact on a recent trip my camera was taking better pictures than the Canon and Nikon owners.- Substantial feel in the hand, controls well-placed, ergonomic grip- Aesthetically pleasing industrial design- Smart Mode night setting can yield amazing hand-held night shots- Good WiFi connectivity, especially if you have a Samsung phone with NFC- Easily updateable firmwareCons:- LCD is washed out in bright sunlight.  Very hard to compose shots.  This is why I only gave four stars.- No option for electronic or optical viewfinder (Hoodman Hood Loupe may be at least partial solution, would like to try)- Flash is detachable external unit, which takes away some of the advantages of being a compact mirrorless camera (I leave mine on most of the time)- Camera not-so-compact with kit lens, but still smaller than most DSLR's- HDR mode hard to get at and unavailable when you have certain other options active -- manual not very helpful on this- Firmware could use an update.  Focus lamp periodically will stop working.One of the things that helped decide the purchase was the WiFi connectivity.  Not too many cameras allow you to post directly to Facebook or send an email directly from the camera (though it is becoming more common).  Transferring images to my Galaxy S4 is also very easy because of the NFC (Near Field Communication) feature that decreases the number of steps you need to take to achieve a connection.  I can also establish a link to my iPad (no NFC) so that I can look at my shots on a larger screen.Is it the best thing since sliced bread?  Probably not.

So I don't have a particular preference of have not bought equipment from a particular camera maker. So there was no pain in my decision when purchasing a digital camera that would require me to purchase its particular lenses and waste any other previous equipment I might have bought.Having a mirror-less digital camera has made my life much easier when carrying it around. I really don't perceive major differences or flaws in its picture quality compared to much bigger DSLR's. I get excellent pictures when shooting up to 12000 ISO, after that the pictures are acceptable.Having an APS-C sensor has also made it easy for me to take more casual pictures in low-light settings. I rarely carry the small flash around except when I know I will be shooting in a party or night events. But even then, shooting w/o the flash has given me excellent results in night settings.The quality of the body, its vintage look, the case, the lens performance, its touch screen and even the carrying bag that came with my purchase (Usain Bolt's Edition) has made me a very happy Samsung customer.Since I also own a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone, I have used its wireless features to send the pictures I'm shooting instantly to my phone so that I can then share them on the spot. To me, this is really a very useful feature.And lastly, the Lightroom Software that comes bundled with the camera made my purchase a total bargain compared to the other camera offers.I can assure you that will be very pleased if you decide to purchase this particular camera.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for any experience level", "Author": "Leah \"the Zat\"", "ReviewID": "R3F082AUX3T1J9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the NX300 for a couple of months now and have shot over 1000 images, so I feel like I am getting the hang of it and could provide an opinion for those who are trying to decide which mirrorless system to purchase.I was considering the Lumix as well as Nikon systems and decided to go with the Samsung NX300 because of superior resolution and frankly the price; as an 'underdog' in the photography world, Samsung prices this system aggressively and you can't get a 20+ megapixel system for any less.  I also read several reviews of the available lenses, and it sounds like across the board, people consider the Samsung lenses on par or even better than the other mirrorless interchangeable lens systems on the market. The sensor is amazing, color representation is accurate, and the added software features/touchscreen system are fairly easy to use, although slightly more clunky than a polished mobile phone system.Ease of use: The main control is the knob on top which lets you toggle between automatic vs. more customized settings.  If automatic settings are chosen, the system itself is easy to use without any prior photography knowledge. On the other hand, you can select and optimize the settings to your heart's content using the top knob/dial and choosing your specific settings through the touchscreen menus. You can also access controls using the 'iFn' button on the lens itself.  One thing that I unexpectedly really enjoy using are the 'Smart\" settings. The long exposure settings (waterfall, light trace) are fun to use and the night mode is really useful - you can get great low light/night shots without a tripod. In addition, one of the most useful features is the ability to transfer images directly to your phone.  This is very useful when traveling or are out and about as you don't necessarily need an internet connection and don't need to transfer images through your computer.  You do need to download the Samsung Smart Camera app for this feature, which exists for both android and iOS.Lenses:  The NX300  body doesn't have onboard 'optical image stabilization' (OIS); however, lenses are available with OIS, which seems to be a decent option, you just need to make sure you are aware of whether or not the lens includes OIS when you choose lenses. That being said, I've used the 18-55 OIS lens (purchased the body/lens kit) and I also have used the 20 mm pancake lens.  Both are excellent and have onboard OIS.  The 20 mm lens isn't quite as flat as I expected, but it is still quite compact and serves as a capable multipurpose lens.  The 20 mm lens doesn't allow you to manually focus, at least not that I've been able to figure out.  The 18-55 lens has a toggle on the lens that allows you to switch between manual and auto focus; this is really useful when you find yourself in a situation where you would want to manually focus but not look away from your shot.  Also, the ability to zoom in with this lens is also very useful and the overall size of the lens is not small, but not awkwardly large either.Cons:  Lack of a viewfinder.  This is really only a problem when you are in very bright light situations where the sunlight overpowers the otherwise perfectly fine AMOLED display.  I still am able to see enough to snap pictures, I'm just not able to see as much detail in bright light.  One other thing for people who are big smartphone (i.e. touch screen) photographers is that the touch to focus option is not quite as useful or responsive as you would expect after using a smartphone camera.In summary, this is a great camera system and I think users with a range of experience could all enjoy shooting with this camera.  If you are hesitant because it's not a well known optics brand, I'd suggest taking the plunge, you'll be glad you did.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "NX300 Review", "Author": "cantor", "ReviewID": "R31G5FFH7120HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Samsung NX300 camera along with the 30mm pancake lens.All I can say is WOW!

One of themwas a Sony compact that got very good reviews but took awful pictures.  The other wasmy Canon Rebel Xti.  The pictures are as good as the best Canon shots and I don't havefocusing problems which has plagued the Canon since I first purchased it a few years ago.So I'm really happy with the purchase.  If you want to charge your battery outside ofthe camera you will need to purchase an external battery charger.

It has no see-through eye piece.  You work with an LED screen instead.  It's designed with that ugly 1950s look. The buttons feel awkward. The lens is much heavier than the camera, creating a front-heavy camera. The camera strap is made from cheap material and very uncomfortable. But that's where the negatives end.  After playing around with this camera for a few days now, I must say I'm very impressed with its performance.It's a lightweight point-and-shoot camera with removable lenses.  The 18-55mm lens works well as the kit lens.  One can take great close-ups with this set-up.  The motion stabilizer helps keep photos in focus for those moving subjects in mediocre light.  Sharpness is maintained from a foot away for close-ups.  The LED screen can be toggled to 45 degrees for better viewing.  It comes with a horseshoe for flash units.Sharpness is also maintained during the video, which is something my Canons can't seem to master.  For those who shoot video, this is a great plus.  Image quality is also above par.Even more impressive, though, is the in-camera enhancements one can do before photos are even uploaded.  You can zoom in, crop, change contrast/exposure with the touchscreen LED. Set the camera up to your Facebook and you can instantly upload them there. This is a great plus for those who may not necessarily be expert photographers, but who simply like being tuned in to social media.  For those who prefer uploading/downloading photos the old-fashioned way, there is a proprietary USB cable included.Charging this camera is also easy.  With the same proprietary cable one can plug the camera either into a PC or use the enclosed AC adapter and use a wall outlet.  A full charge takes about two hours.The price has dropped since I have had this camera.  At USD549 this camera is at a good price.

This camera is an upgrade from my NX210 that I purchased last year. On my Amazon review of the NX210 I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars. I thought that the mediocre focusing system subtracted 1/2 star. After reading the positive reviews of NX300 and noting the several awards it already won I just had to have one. I decided on the white one and wow am I glad I did. It is one fantastic looking device. I was initially contemplating the more compact 20 - 50 mm kit lens but ultimately went with the 18 - 55 mm lens. The latter not only offers a wider focal length, but also features optical internal stabilization. I can definitely notice that the focusing system is an improvement over the NX210. It's the quickest, most accurate focusing camera I've ever experienced. I'm also happy to report that the focusing system is no longer audible during video playback. The articulated touchscreen is a nice upgrade as well. The touchscreen is responsive and makes the camera easier-to-use overall. Otherwise, it takes the same \"SLR quality\" photos the NX210 takes but with a much higher chance of being in focus.

So I just use one of my extra iPod wall plugs to charge it, which seems to work just fine.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect size for a big job", "Author": "Angela Brooks \"angelabrook (dot) com\"", "ReviewID": "R2UMBPJ9S0H1YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really pleased at the speed it will snap pictures at a baseball game - the nice clean and clear shots - small fast - and upload to facebook from the camera", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung NX300", "Author": "Cathy", "ReviewID": "RZ3AFXSAGC6QL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the Samsung NX300, its light ,great features in the camera and love the WiFi and don't need to buy WiFi sd card.

The only reason I don't give the camera a 5 star is because it required a firmware update which was a pain in the ass to install (took over an hour because either the camera or the samsung website kept locking up).  Well, it finally went through, and it actually made the menu and functions even easier to use in the end--so it was clearly worth it.Many users have been complaining that the facebook connect wasn't working, that it would give an error on upload.

The Canon EOS M was good too, but it's focusing system was too slow.  The RX100 was great, but simply wasn't versatile enough as an SLR.Overall I found the image quality fantastic, and the focusing has been the best I have had in any of the non-professional digital cameras I have owned.

This is an impressive entry into the current mid range digital camera market.Not the best, most expensive camera I have, but I love it for what it is and what it is capable of, and the freedom it gives me.One thing with many cameras of this size so far has been small sensors that can only handle so much even if the rest of the features are top notch as they can only work with what is captured to begin with.Just adding more mega pixels does not make photo quality better on it's own and adding higher pixel count to tiny sensors can actually hurt the process.The NX300 with APS-C size sensor (23.5mm x 15.7mm) and higher quality interchangeable lens comes a long way in picture quality over those fixed lens, small sensor models.Sensors, no matter how large also have different software builds and features that make one better than another.Great feature that they added a sensor cleaner that you can toggle on/off that cleans the sensor each time the camera is turned on.  Less of a problem if you don't change lenses, but still gets dirt and dust on it sooner or later.This camera is built for the avarage person who wants improved photos and more control with the least amount of equipment to buy and carry around, but I'm guessing there will also be a lot of above average photographers using it or one of it's decendants soon after they try it.There are many other Samsung lenses available to use with this camera body, along with several accessories to add to the functions and features.So far, very fast auto focus in various light conditions, but manual focus is always available if you need it.True, there ARE some other cameras in this class that might come close, but the NX300 is outstanding in it's performance and quality of build at this price level i believe.I do use DSLR cameras and lenses (of other brands) that cost as much as three times what this NX300 does and they do take much better photos... BUT you really can't compare the two classes of cameras except that the NX300 has the same size sensor as they do to start with, and you can change the lenses.Most of the photos I've taken in good light with the NX300 I've been able to crop in to around 60-70% and they retain enough detail to be used.The 18-55mm lens that comes with this kit is pretty nice and covers an area that most use their cameras in.  Other NX300 kits/combos are available so be sure to look at them all and buy what fits your needs or future needs.No built in EVF... (electronic view finder) and that is too bad, but it does lower the cost of the camera.  It really depends on what you are used to, if all you've used is the live screen view for digital photography then no problem at all and the screen is very nice, bright, sharp and large and can be seen in all but the most direct SunlightWith a small app download I have used my Samsung Galaxy S4 to view through the NX300 and take photos from a remote location via the WiFi...  useful?  Can't say yet.  Fun?  You bet it is!Main difference in use between viewfinder and live screen is that with the screen you must hold the camera out in front of you rather than having it up close to your head and body.  That makes it a bit more unstable in use and can cause some photo blur at lower shutter speeds if your not careful.Just be sure to brace yourself or use a support of some sort to get the best low light shots.Optical Image Stabilization is available but it depends on lens used.  This 18-55 has it but as with most cameras it's not all that effective in my opinion.No built in flash... but does come with a small flash (guide number 8) that you can slip into the hotshoe on top of the camera when you need it.  Hotshoe will also take larger flash if you buy one that works with the camera.  The little one supplied will cover most average situations but you just might start doing more involved photography with this camera and want more coverage etc.No built in GPS... but again, an Optional GPS Module (WGS84) is available as add on that slips into the hotshoe same as flash.  You got it... can't use GPS and flash at the same time.  Problem?  Not to me, but might be to you so letting you know.Touch screen feature works well, just depends on if you prefer touch screens or buttons.  Buttons are also available for same controls if you like better, but both can be active at the same time.... I don't like to get finger smears on the LCD that you need to compose your shots with, but that's up to you to decide.Uses standard size SD memory cards up to 64GB.  Up to 32GB uses HC cards, over that needs XC cards.Just make sure to get the fastest class 10 whatever brand you buy.Lowest price, off brand class 4 card will bring the overall performance down to where you will not be happy.Not going to repeat all the specs in this review, you can see those listed in the product description at Amazon or Samsung, many, many great features with this camera.  What I want you to know is that it's a nice build, feels good in hand, has great retro 35mm looks, and takes great photos for it's class.Takes very nice full HD 2d & 3D videos (& 3D stills) with stereo sound as well, BUT only when using 45mm EX-S45ADW/US Lens onlyCan record up to 29 mins 59 sec at a time... make sure you have plenty of fast memory card space.Remember, this is not a pocket size point and shoot, you can't tuck it in your pocket and go, (well, depends on your pocket size) it needs to hang on the shoulder strap or be in a small camera bag.  With this 18-55 lens the smallest measurement with lens hood backwards and cap on, the front to back is 5\" and it's about 4 3/4\" side to side X 2 1/2\" tall.  With battery, strap, lens hood and cap (18-55mm) ready to go out the door it weighs 1 lb 5 ozsYou MIGHT fit it into a large pocket when using a Samsung 16, 20 or 30mm pancake prime lens perhaps, and the weight will be less.Be sure to check for firmware update for body, mine needed one right off even new from the box, latest available from the Samsung NX300 web pageOh, Yes it will take photos in RAW format as well as JPG if you like...you might not want to get into your photos this much, and you sure don't need to to get great shots (many ways to modify photos IN-camera) but have a look at the cost of LightRoom 4 software that comes with it for free;Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 4 [Download] [Old Version]...

There\u2019s nothing intuitive about it.  Sometimes it literally refuses to take a picture.  Now, I don\u2019t mind that the camera is smarter than me, but does it have to rub it in?Now that I\u2019ve gone through the manual and played with the camera for a few weeks, I discovered its charms.
