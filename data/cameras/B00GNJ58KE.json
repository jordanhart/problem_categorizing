Only one lens was accommodated with these essentials as part of the package.Circuit City added a sunshade and filter set for another lens; this should be part of the package.I also found that receiving only one disk to put pictures on was limiting.  I always use 2 (one for RAW and one for JPG) but like to have an extra two on hand.  I will order extra cards to fill that gap.The product is excellent.Circuit City went out of their way to be accommodating - courteous and professional.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GNJ58KE"}}
