{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Celestialsky29", "ReviewID": "R9HM9FC3NK0N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera would be great for a teenager!  It has good, quality photos, and has a lot of scene settings to choose from.  The zoom is good, but not something you could take to a concert.  The camera is really compact, so you can easily carry it in your purse.  The battery doesn't last very long, so if you are taking it on a long trip, where you can't charge it for awhile, this would pose a problem.You can have this on manual, or you can preset the scene.  I have played with all of the scenes, and they seem to be good for what they are set for.  However, it does take blurry pictures of moving objects, no matter what scene setting you choose.  I have chosen the sports, party, and panning scene, and all of them take blurry shots of people moving.  However, I LOVE the panoramic feature on this camera.  It is the easiest panoramic feature I have used.  I also love the cat scene, as it completely eliminates the red eye from my cat.I don't like where the battery is charged.  It isn't a removable battery, you have to plug the camera in, which isn't a big deal, but the plug in location on the camera is up tight to the plastic hinge part of the plastic \"door\" that covers the plug in ports.  I have to fight with it to get the cord plugged in to the camera.  I can see this possibly causing the plastic hinge to eventually break do to wear and use.  I could be wrong, but it is a concern that I have.Overall, I wouldn't purchase this camera if I were looking for a high quality camera.  This camera has good quality photos, but not great.  I gave it a 4, because it's not a bad camera, and I like it, but it wouldn't be my first choice in cameras.Edited 7/18/12I was only to take 10 minutes of constant video with this camera before the fully charged battery ran out.  That is a very, very poor battery life.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Merely OK.", "Author": "owookiee \"owookiee\"", "ReviewID": "R3AEX04KBLBAEK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a decent enough pocket camera if you can get a good deal on it.  It takes good pictures in low light, though the white balance is usually off.  The image stabilization compensates for small movement well, and there wasn't a lot of noise in pictures.However, my beefs:-Panorama mode is designed nice, but does a poor job if you're not photographing a landscape.  I tried to do the yard, but close-by trees threw it off.  Also did not perform well trying to photograph a room.-Manual mode doesn't appear to allow setting of shutter/aperture like I thought it would.  The manual doesn't give any detail.-HDR mode is nice, but your subject has to be still for about 4-5 seconds for the two images to be captured and merged.  If there is movement, it appears the 2nd image takes precedence for the actual image, with the first image used just for color/light calculations.-The zoom is powerful, but it does not focus fully zoomed on anything closer than about 8 feet.  I tried to zoom in on someone's face for a portrait and I would have been better served walking closer rather than zooming.Overall, I feel like you'll get a better functioning pocket camera in the latest Canon ELPH series of cameras in this price range, perhaps with lesser zoom and megapixels (though you probably won't need the difference between 12 and 14mp).  I'm not sure how long GE has been in this market, but it seems like they're still getting their feet wet and have some things to work out.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing picture quality, especially in low light", "Author": "Sherry Berry", "ReviewID": "R39Q9ZD8XUCPZV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this camera with some high expectations because it is advertised as being full HD and able to hook up via HDMI cable. I am comparing this to my Sony Cybershot DSC90, which I have had for 2-3 years with no problems. It does take a SD card to store pictures, which is something I do like. However, the internal memory seems to be lacking. I tried to take a video without a SD card and it would not take it. As soon as I put in the SD card, I was able to shoot videos.In terms of functionality, the buttons are a bit hard to press and not super responsive. I have to push the shooting button down really hard and have to hold it a while before a picture will snap. At first, I thought maybe it wasn't working. Also, while there is a button just for shooting videos, which is convenient, it took me a few tries to hit it before it started recording and by then, I missed the moment. Along with the button being hard to press, the shutter speed is also dismal. It takes about 4-5 seconds for it to focus and flash at night and take the picture. So of course, I tend to miss a lot of precious things that my baby is doing since I got the camera mainly to shoot pictures of her. My Sony Cybershot never took that long to take a picture and was more instantaneous.Another con about this camera is every time you turn it on, it goes to a screen that asks you what kind of setting you want (auto scene, children, twilight, etc.) This takes extra time for the camera to be fully ready to take the picture. I just want to be able to turn on the camera and start shooting like I could with my cybershot but it takes at least an extra 6 seconds or more for the camera to be ready for picture taking. There may be a way to turn it off but I haven't found it.As for the picture quality, I was truly disappointed with what I got. It was decent in the daylight pictures but once it got to be night time, the pictures came out dark and grainy. The cybershot isn't great either with night time pictures but I can get some decent and OK shots with that camera.All in all, I really wanted to like this camera but it just did not deliver for me.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a pocket sized digital camera with large 3\" LCD", "Author": "M. Gehret \"G-Man  Colorado\"", "ReviewID": "R5F5Z6MESVFLO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GE camera is fairly good design, strangely charges by plugging in camera to wall outlet with attachment.  Nice size 3\" LCD screen and was easy to set-up and begin using right out of the box.  If buyer gets this for a good price , it can actually be a nice camera for daily use. Accepts SDHC cards and battery is specific to the manufacturer.  Charge time is good, but a back up battery (if able to find) is recommended rather than to try and re-charge from to a wall.  Not a bad investment. Suprising features are CMOS sensor (for low light subjects). 14.1 Megapixels, F 3.2 -5.6 lens, Optical zoom 10x, Opitcal Stabilization, Movies shoot in 1080 at 30 fps, HDMI out port and recharges next to HDMI out.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot camera", "Author": "Lauren A.", "ReviewID": "R378ZVJLPGRWCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a basic point and shoot camera.  If you're looking for the crisp imaging that you get with a DSLR, this camera is not for you.  But if you're looking for a small, easy to use camera that fits in your purse and takes decent pictures, then this is a good pick.  The pictures do not come out quite as blurry as some older point and shoots.  The camera does everything a typical, casual user could want.  This really is not meant for anyone who fancies themselves as a photographer as a hobby.  This is really the type of camera that you just stick in your bag and take with you.  Like most cameras, the SDHC card is not included.  I bought a 32 GB SDHC card pretty inexpensively here on Amazon.com.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A  WIN FOR ME. -  ALMOST", "Author": "Bill McLean \"Is this worth the price?\"", "ReviewID": "R1FASEZNGIQ5S1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice little pocket camera for non-photographer consumers. Mine is new yet so I can't comment on its durability or expected life.  Also, only professional market executives could explain why it lacks popularity.  It is a good camera.I'm giving it 5-STARS because I purchased it at Sears for only $19.97 (USD).  No tax in Oregon.  No shipping and handling.  And no box.  It was the last one they had and it was on display.  It came with everything - except the box.This camera is a point and shoot, but with lots of nice features.  Users can choose to either leave it on full automatic or select from 25+ modes and/or settings.  I haven't seen some of these new modes on other cameras.  For example, separate settings for adults, childre, dogs, and cats. (The camera will use any one of these modes to focus and track the subjects, adjust shutter speed, and cause bursts of shooting up to 10fps.) I also like to see the text copy mode.  This makes the camera almost as good at this task as the scanners available in the library or at home.  Most other modes are also useful and more familiar to me. The camera shows very clear examples of each mode (with and without use of each mode) as user looks at the screen to make a choice.  This is pretty cool for regular consumers who just want family pictures with only occasional use otherwise.The lens has a 10-X range and a maximum aperture of f2.8.  This gives the camera a great deal of flexibility, both in terms of low light use and in terms of wide angle and telephoto use.  And I am also pleased with the degree of sharpness produced by this lens.  Along with the built-in Image Stabilizer and the CMOS Sensor, the lens can gives great photo results even in poor lighting. I should also mention that the 3-inch LCD screen is also really good.Cons:1)The camera cannot shoot RAW images - only JPEG.  This means that anything except a little cropping (also called trimming)is all the editing that usually should be done2)The battery must be charged in the camera and the connections are a bit tight and difficult to get used to.  (I have a fix for this problem.)3)It's smallness makes it hard to hold on to while shooting and making settings, but it does come with a wrist strap to keep the camera safe.4)The battery is also very small so one would expect it to shoot less pictures per charge than many other little cameras.  (Only 150 shots at best.)5)I know nothing about GE's technical support.6)The video is not as good as some consumers would hope for - but it's not that bad either.  Personally, I'm not interested in video.After I got this camera home I was surprised with the quality and flexibility of this little thing.  At this price, I feel like I was on the winning side of a sucker deal.update: 1/8/2013I'm downgrading my review from 5-STARS to 4-STARS.  This is because of shutter lag.  The shutter starts to open almost a full second after I press the button.  This means I'll miss all shots requiring fast action - for me, the best shots.  Second of importance is the weak Image Stabilizer.  Shooting at night I get much clearer shots with the Panasonic Lumix **** that has the same sized sensor and even slightly smaller maximum lens aperture.The technical science behind this GM camera is great, but for the above reasons it doesn't compete well against some of the competition.But don't kid yourselves: this is a great little camera to start on, especially if you can get a great reduction in price.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality for the price", "Author": "almosthappy", "ReviewID": "RDN9UX9XW8Y98", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far this camera has met my expectations.  It's not an expensive camera and, to a certain extent, you get what you pay for.  Given it's pricing, this camera is really quite nice.  It's an excellent size, shape and weight, which makes it easy to carry around on short or long trips.  It also has a good wide-angle lens and takes pretty nice panoramic pictures.  The video quality and photo quality are good for the price.  They are not the best you will see, but for a camera that is simple to use and not too expensive, they are fine.  The biggest drawback for me with this camera has been the battery life.  The battery really only lasts through something like 100 pictures, and since I can take that many in a day on a trip, this is very frustrating.  I definitely don't hope to have to charge my camera every night while away, but with this one, I do.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Marcos S.

It's a straightforward camera, so if you like the convenience of auto mode, just point and shoot.  It fits nicely in your pocket, but I think the price point is a little too high (as of this review, $140).  The photos aren't as focused as some of the other similarly priced cameras I've had (Canon, Nokia), and the poor audio during video recording is disappointing.Some nice stuff...- This does NOT use a proprietary charging cable so I used my cell phone's micro USB charger to charge the camera!  This saves space when traveling and keeps me from having to sort through a pile of charger cables.- Printed instructions included with camera (a lot of companies are replacing instruction booklets with CDs)Meh, the not so great...- No case included with camera so you have to buy your own (very common these days).- When I zoomed in while recording a short video, I actually heard the zoom noise in the video itself!  I understand there may be some background noise, but the zoom was distractingly audible.  It didn't pick up on voices all that well either.- I don't know how much of the lack of focus is due to the stabilization or the optical zoom or the 14MP or all of the above, but some of my photos are out of focus.  I mean, more than usual...with this camera, 6 of 40 pictures were kind of fuzzy.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me!", "Author": "Pampered Prepper", "ReviewID": "RVNDAYWYU1CYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a digital camera about 4 years ago but when it broke I never bothered to replace it because I just used my cellphone. Its not like I have an iphone so its was always a gamble as to how well the pictures would turn out. So when I was offered this General Imaging HD camera through the Amazon Vine program I didn't hesitate to grab it. What a beautiful camera and since I love to take pictures but am in no way a professional photographer this is perfect for me. The camera comes with a warranty card, CD-ROM, wrist strap(another reviewer noted that since it is grey it appears mis matched,i disagree because the camera has silver highlighting I feel that it looks nice) usb cable, rechargeable lithium -ion battery and a AC adapter. It does not come with an SD card and you'll need one Id recommend picking up a carrying case as well. I love the usb cable because its the exact same one as my phone, my husbands phone, my kindle fire, and my GoPro so for me its no big deal that the usb isnt all that long. It took about an hour and a half to fully charge the battery but the manual recommends to charge the camera for 4 hours the first time. I'm not gonna lie there's a lot on this camera as far as features goes so it will take me some time to figure it all out,but the pictures and videos I have taken look great! Its a very thin light weight camera and is perfect for anyone especially if your transitioning from something simple to something more complicated. Well done GE,I highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "M. C.
