{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon Mark III & Canon Support", "Author": "Todd in Upstate NY", "ReviewID": "R29L7LHTP0HD6J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In the last 3 years I have gone from 2 different point and shot cameras to the Canon 30D to the Canon Mark III. With each camera, I was telling myself - this should do it for some time. I read and learned as much as I could with each camera. When I got the 30D I was on cloud 9 - this was great - it would be nice to shoot faster though. When I heard about the Mark III coming out, I knew that was hopefully the last stepping stone I would require for sometime.This thing rocked - couldn't believe how fast it could shot. I was surprised at how many shots were out of focus though (birding). I didn't experience anything like this on the 30D. I read about the AI focus problems and thought - well this is what is happening to me. For the next 5 months Canon stone walled me on a weekly basis. Promised firmware fixes, this fix that fix, reps telling me off.I wrote a letter to Yoroku Adachi (President of Canon U.S.A.) and got a call back from one of his people. Very apologetic but same old please be patient and apologies galore - but still we won't replace it with a functioning camera - it is a minor issue (again I was told that by numerous reps) - I say it is only minor if you don't use those features.5 \u00bd months later it got fixed. I missed the birding season but there is next year (I was told that by a rep too!). It looks like the problem is fixed and looking forward to spring migration. If someone is reading this and hasn't purchased any camera gear yet, buy Nikon. I have too much invested in Canon gear to switch.I would probably give the camera 4.5-5 stars now. Canon Support would get a 0.Updated: May 29th, 2008With the latest firmware updates and hardware fix, I would give this Camera an easy 5 stars. I have shot plays indoors at ISO 1600 (no flash) and can't believe how sharp shots come out.My issue is still with Canon Tech (lack of) Support. I called yesterday about the WFT-E2A and got the usual run-a-round about the product. If you don't think you will ever need Canon Tech (lack of) Support, go Canon.Updated October 11th, 2009Well, I finally sent my camera in because I have been getting Error 99's since February - It is nice that it is working agaiin but I have no idea what to say about this camera - when it works it is great but I have had it for about 26 months and out of that time it had either the auto focus  problem out of the box and error 99 problems. I would say I have had to deal with the camera being defective for about half of the time I have had it. Canon Support had me do all this useless stuff which of course involved me spending money on memory cards, calibrating the battery, using the AC adapter, various lenses, and cleaning contacts.I was able to limp along with the camera for about 8 months because I came up with my own 'solution' of pulling the memory cards out, removing the lens, using the ac adapter (instead of the battery), and plugging in the TC803 and just setting that to shoot away until the error 99's stopped. I would than leave the camera on it on and changed the tc803 to take a picture every 3 minutes so it wouldn't go off into error 99 land again.If I were a pro I would have dumped all my canon gear because this thing has been so unreliable. I have resisted purchasing any other canon bodies because of all the headaches I have had with this thing. Canon Support was friendly but wasted a ton of my time and some more of my $$$. It would be nice to get some sort of gift card from Canon or a lens at cost for all my mental anguish.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fast, accurate, reliable", "Author": "Jason Tu \"Dog Photo Man\"", "ReviewID": "R2H8402FITGP3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this camera for 3 weeks now. About 600 pictures have been taken at this time. Without any reservation, I can highly recommend this camera on the following reasons:1) Auto focus - I tried all modes, one-shot or al-servo. I used a combination of lens - 180 mm micro, 28-300mm telezoom, 24-70mm and never experienced the problems mentioned on the web as claimed so by some experts. It was as hot as 85 degrees in a very dry heat area. The camera performed flawlesslty.2) Color - comparing the color of the shots taken from 1d mark iii and 1d mark ii n, I have found that the color is more natural and rich. There is no distortion to my eyes. I shot using 100 - 1600 ISO and saw the consistent color quality in netural mode.3) Sensor cleaning - it works very effectively. I had to clean up the sensor on my 1d mark ii n almost every 50-100 shots. Now, the automatic cleaning starts whenever I power off of change lens. Sometimes I have to do it twice. Overall, it works very well.4) View finder - not only the 3 inch LCD is larger but it is also more clear and real to see the pictures. I am really satisified with the display.5) Control - the new layout is much better than 1d mark iin. I use 20d type of control with one finger, I can change and navigate quickly. 1d mark iin is less intuitive.6) Battery power - I used a varierty of zoom lens and played back a lot using the LCD. After 500 shots, the battery showed that I still have 50% or so jucie to go. I think that achieving 1000 shots on a full charged battery is quite good. My previous 1d mark ii n can only go for half or 1/3 of it.Overall, I am very satified with the performance. However, the software provided to clean up the dust is not that great. The dust data somehow is not recognized by the software. I have to use other software to clean up the dust. Out of 500 pictures, I got 5 pictures showing dust and I removed them in two sensor cleaning cycles.  It is an expensive toy but well worth the money if you can afford it.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but not in the beginning", "Author": "W. A. Freeman Jr.", "ReviewID": "R206714X48RGRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the Mark III for a little over a year. Not long after receiving it, it quit. I sent it in for a \"mirror magnet\" problem. After I got it back I would get an Err99 almost daily. I documented it with Canon. It would happen most often when I turned it on for the first time. After several conversations with Canon, I sent it in and they replaced the mirror box. It has not had an Err 99 since then.The camera was purchased as a \"Blue Dot\", meaning it had been fixed for the original focus issues some people were reporting. Since the second repair it has functioned flawlessly and now focuses to meet anyone's reasonable expectations. I get 80% to 90% in-focus. In most of the out of focus photos there was a legitimate reason. I can see this when I check my photos in Canon's Zoom Browser. I can see where the camera was focused at the time of shutter release. It is easy to miss a shot on a fast moving object by missing the subject or hitting a different part of the subject. Often times it would be the focus changing from head to hip (on a running dog), not the camera's fault but mine.There are many settings on this camera to fine tune it to your way of shooting and the shooting situation. I have gotten some awesome action shots from this camera and am very pleased with it.Canon clearly brought this camera to market too soon. It was not tested properly or either production standards were not watched. I would bet that the parts they were producing were not meeting the standards of their research and development, plus the conditions that caused a problem may not have been reproduced in test. This clearly threw Canon for a loop and they did a poor job managing public relations. I am surprised there has not been a class action lawsuit since so many pros use this camera. Some have toughed it out; those who had a lot of money went to Nikon, which is currently hitting it with some good cameras, something Canon normally is known for.If you are buying a Mark III now, you are more than likely going to be blown-away by such a great camera that focuses and gives you shots you never imagined. I love shooting it and learning to fine-tune it for particular shooting circumstance.Working as it works now, I would purchase it again.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Essential tool for a professional photographer.", "Author": "Alonzo D. Eubank \"aeubank\"", "ReviewID": "R1JNOIK06X6L4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the Mark III in September 2007.  Over one year later this camera still continues to amaze me!  The controls are laid out perfectly and the camera feels like it's just the right size in my hands.Others have complained about the price, but believe me, you get what you pay for!!  I purchased this camera to take professional portraits, weddings special events.  This camera was an upgrade from the Canon 20d and 30d cameras I previously owned.Some of my favorite features are the auto - ISO feature.  This mode allows you to set the camera in shutter or aperture priority, and if the camera cannot compensate for the exposure, it automatically increases the ISO.  Great feature that allows the photographer more creative control of the picture while getting that perfect shot every time.Another nice feature is the live view shooting.  This mode allows you to take long pictures, or pictures in awkward angles without requirig you to look into the viewfinder.  You still have to manually focus.Another feature I like is the ability for the camera to record on multiple media targets.  You can set the camera up to record raw on one card and jpeg on another.  Or, you can set the camera up to jump to the other card when one is full.  This is very convenient for me since I shoot in RAW.Another feature is the limits, configuration, and file handling settings.  You can set the minimum and maximum ISO, shutter, aperture settings, fast shutter speed, slow shutter speed, and the camera will compensate within your set parameters and deliver results.One last feature worth noting is the microadjustment.  This camera allows you to micro adjust for each of your lenses.  This is especially useful if you have a front focusing lens that appears to be just a little off.  You can adjust the camera so when you attach that lens, the camera automatically adjusts for that particular lens.Sure, this camera costs a few dollars more, but the payback in the pictures is nothing short of amazing..  This is a TRUE professional camera and as such requires the photographer to have a significant knowledge of photography.The battery life is phenomenal!  Not only does the camera provide you with a battery meter, it has a menu setting that actually tells you what percentage of battery life you have left and the number of shutter actuations since the last charge.  I routinely manage over 2000 (and once over 3000) actuations on a single charge.  This is something that NO other digital camera can do!  Significant upgrade over the 1dMarkII series cameras where the battery was larger, heavier, and lasted for at most 700 actuations.  I thought of purchasing a backup battery, but haven't brought myself to do so because of the longevity of this battery.This camera has been a very important compliment to my existing L series lenses.Overall, I would recommend this camera for the professional photographer that is SERIOUS about the business of photography and needs proven professional equipment to deliver results to the customer.  I have been considering purchasing a second Mark III as a backup to the one I own.  My 5d is currently my backup camera (great, but not at the same level as the EOS-1 series).You can check out some of my pictures at [...]", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Quality Product", "Author": "Mr. Paul Walsh", "ReviewID": "R169H2JPEUJH40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a sports photographer. I've been using this camera for a while now. I decided to give it a good testing before even writing any remarks.There seems to be a lot of hype about the focus issue. Personally, I've never experienced the problem, and I bet the majority of photographers haven't either. Some people need to do research before blaming the camera. There are many user faults, causing the camera to seem as if it is not focusing.  They also need to check their lenses.I shoot different sports, from rugby to show jumping, polo and horse racing. So, tracking a fast moving object (person or horse) is very important. Out of about 100 images, maybe 2 would be out of focus. Those I would more blame on myself than the camera. People really need to RTFM. There are so many custom settings, especially for focus, to enable you to use the camera to it's full potential, for whatever you use it for.The camera is pure quality. I don't deny that there are some focus issues, but again, these are under specific circumstances. The body is solid and sturdy. It is good to hold and not too heavy. The battery life is brilliant (nearly 3,000 shots per charge). The fps is stunning. I've had to limit my burst rate to 25 frames, just so I don't fill my memory cards too quickly. :-) I did give it a good workout, using the full fps and burst rate at an event, and I was stunned.There are just so many custom functions, that allow you to setup the camera depending on what you are doing. That is brilliant for me, since some events are at night under lights, while others are during the day, either cloudy or bright. Different saved setting sets allow me to quickly change to suit my circumstances.For those who need a fast, reliable pro camera, this would very much be my camera of choice.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Finally Perfect", "Author": "RWT \"Tennessee Photo\"", "ReviewID": "R2JNWWJTW6IK5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When one reads the early reviews of this camera, they will be surprised to see the focusing problems experienced by a seeminly large number of photographers.  Canon has come out with both hardware and firmware fixes to this body.  I purchased a model with a serial number indicating manufacture after these fixes have been effected.  I am having absolutely no issues with this camera's focusing in both focusing modes.  I love this camera.  It is truely a magnificient camera.

I've had this body for over 6 months now, and it's by far the worst purchase decision I've every made.1.  It doesn't focus as it's supposed to.  It has out of focus shots for one shot and AI modes, at a far worse rate than its predecessor.  Canon even acknowledged this defect.2.  It has severe error problems (such as Error 99).3.  Even after the fix, it still doesn't focus as it should -- lots of professional sites note this -- and now Canon is indicating as of 2/1 that there could be another fix in the works.If you're like me and heavily invested in Canon glass, then there's nothing to do but ride it out and hope they eventually get it right.  (I still have faith in Canon, and think their products are very good, and the image quality of the 1dIII is simply amazing when it works....)  But if you're new to the dslr (and ask yourself then, why you need such an expensive body anyway), it's worth investigating other options.

For shooting in non perfect weather, like my Alaskan winters, or even some summer days, this camera does perform great.  The Battery life is great.  I am use to long life, as all my cameras have the battery grips on them, but I was shocked by how long the battery lasted with the new Mark, and even better it telling you when to recondition it!  WOW!!The NOISE on the Mark 3 is FANTASTIC!!  Compared to the 5d, its almost 2 stops better, and thats with the cameras noise reduction mode turned off.  The noise/grain at 3200 is very useable, and even 6400 is not too bad, granted I would not print a 20x30 but at iso 1600 I can.  The Highlight preservation feature is great, esp for wedding photographers.  You can now shoot the wedding dress in sunlight and have the detail!  I know several pros that are moving from their nikon d2x to the Mark 3 because of that and the very low noise!!!I shoot Automotive (hot rods and high end sports cars, and make custom photographic art for the owner), as well as the wonderous Alaskan wilderness, landscapes and wildlife.  This Camera is a dream to use.  It is not as heavy as the older Marks, and personally I think it is about the same weight as the 5D was with the battery grip, but has a better fell in my hand.The 10MP is fine and I can still take images to 20x30 and larger with no problems!  The 1.3 crop factor still gives me the prospective I like on my extreme wide angle lenses, like my 14mm or the fisheye.  If you are one of the lucky ones to get one of these wonderful cameras, you are lucky, if you want one, get on a list fast.Mine is even used a lot around and for photos of the guests at my folks B&B; in Soldtona Alaska, the Kenai River Hideaway, and even the guests love to see it, and are impressed by the quality images even at low light!

When it does focus correctly or if I shoot landscapes in manual focus mode the images are incredible, but the AF totally sucks and is completely unreliable. It can't be trusted. I've shot hundreds of comparison shots between the 1D MkIII and my 20D and the 20D outperforms it in AF 90% of the time.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNTIL CANON ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM, ANNOUNCES A FIX FOR IT AND RECALLS/REPAIRS ALL THE CAMERAS THAT HAVE THE PROBLEM AND THE USER COMMUNITY AGREES THAT IT IS FIXED.", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "OK, there may be focus issues, but this camera is still awesome", "Author": "Ignacio Feito Garcia \"Ignacio\"", "ReviewID": "RJMCIVY6V6ZG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not to contradict R. Herbert who did the first review of this camera, there do appear to be some issues on the SERVO focusing on Some Lenses and Some focusing conditions.However there are several photographers out there that have not run into any focusing issues (I'm one) and we are all sure that Canon will look into the issue and come out with a fix.Meanwhile if you are considering this camera I would suggest that you don't let this issues turn you away from in unless you plan to shoot track and field events in the next couple of months.The advantages of this camera over almost any other cameras in the market is amazing.Clean ISO 3200 and a very useable ISO 6400, 10 frames per second shooting, Live view (it works!), new light battery that seems to last forever, real wheather sealed body, more customizeable options that you can think of...What else?  14-Bit images, highlight priority mode, fine tuning of all your lenses' focusing, dual card shooting...I had been thinking about a 5D, however when this camera came out I was amazed at all the available functions and decided to forego the full frame (Sensor size is 28.1 x 18.7 mm, a 1.28 crop factor) and go for this beauty.If you can afford it and are considering it (and you can find one) by all means go for it, you won't be dissapointed.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "EOS 1D - Great camera with exception of AI Servo", "Author": "Richard in Toronto", "ReviewID": "R3W150XSNP7Y22", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SYNOPSISI have had this camera for two months and LOVE it!  The build quality, colour \"truth\", speed between frames, and ability to set custom features is remarkable.  I am disappointed with the AI Servo reliability but relieved to see that there is a hardware fix.WHAT I HADPreviously I had a Digital Rebel (300D - I know, I know, it's an older camera fraught with slowness and poor colour reliability but I had great lenses and the Rebel served me well) and had used a variety of other digital SLR's.  The Rebel served me well for 3 years, but it was time to move on.  I shoot 30,000 pictures per year and new that I was going to get a lot of use of the next camera...  Along with the Rebel, I had the 18-55mm f3.5/5.6 (awful - never sharp), the 70-300mm f3.5/5.6 (works okay at f8), the 70-200mm f2.8 IS (unbelievable), the 2x converter (good but too little light for the Rebel), the 24-70mm f2.8 (unbelievable), the 50mm 1.8 (I know it's controversial, but I love this lens - I have tried the f1.4 but I am happy enough with the f1.8), the 17-40mm f4 (lost with 1.6 ratio of the Rebel but decent with the 1.3 of the EOS 1D), the 580EXII Speddlight flash, an E1 handstrap (must with the EOS 1D), and Canon 200 Knapsack.HOW I SHOOTI pretty much only use manual, and sometimes default to Av.  I am a control freak in this way and don't like relinquishing this control.  Focus is always centre-point.WHY THE EOS 1D MKIIII migrated to the EOS1D because most of my pictures were waterskiing and wakeboarding and wanted an ultra-fast, weather-proofed camera that could perform well in low light conditions.  The best conditions for wakeboarding are typically at dawn or dusk, and the best pictures are usually when the subject is doing manoeuvres upside down over the water.  The ability to have 10 fps, useable ISO 3200 shots, and not have to worry about water splashes was pretty attractive.  Of course, this was only one set of reasons for this purchase.  I also have a five year old who refuses to sit still for pictures and smiles are only fleeting!  Even the 10 fps can sometimes not be fast enough for my little one!  My wife's fleeting smiles are another matter!WHAT I LOVE1. SPEEDThe speed (both in terms of frame rate and ISO) is phenomenal.  I am now able to capture pictures that simply would have been missed with other cameras.  Whether it be someone hanging upside down over the wake in the middle of an invert, or a three month old smiling, I have the ability to quickly capture a series of photos and choose the best of the best.  Additionally, I have found that as the sun sets and I set the ISO to 1600 and 3200 I have some useful (and semi-useful, respectively) pictures with good colour saturation and minimal noise.  The 1600 is similar to the noise level that I had as 400 with the Rebel.  I am a small f freak, but the ISO capability is enough to have me think that I could live with some higher f lenses!2. COLOURSI have been shooting with friends with other cameras, XTi, XT, E-volt 500, D70 and the colour retention is unbelievable with the EOS 1D.  Simple pictures are made to be spectacular without any editing.3. BUILD QUALITYThis camera has presence both in terms of weight and size, but everything feels and sounds of quality.  It gives me a heightened sense that every picture is important.  Of course this has the negative, especially when attached to a larger lens, of making yourself conspicuous, and I often hear people making comments like \"Check out that camera\"/\"You give me camera envy\"/\"Do you work for National Geographic?\".  Not the best comments when you are seeking natural pictures.  The camera balances well with the larger L lenses, but looks crazy next to the smaller cheaper lenses (eg. 50mm 1.8).4. CONTROLSThe EOS 1D, like many professional camera allows a lot (as in a LOT) of flexibility regarding dial controls, settings, etc..  This is an individual thing, but I like the overrides on when to focus/shoot, and setting the dial settings so they are intuitive to me.  The heads-up display in the camera together with the accessibility of knobs and triggers are such that I am able to do FAST on-the-fly adjustments.WHAT COULD BE BETTER1. FOCUSI have had no issues with the standard focus (other than with dark-coloured objects in VERY low light), but the AI servo is awful.  Be it photos of oncoming roller-coasters on a sunny hot day, or a child on a swing in sunny and cool weather, the servo almost seems to be worse that standard focus.  This issue with the EOS 1D is well documented on many websites (see Rob Galbraith) and, as of October 17, 2007, help is one the way.  There is a hardware fix.2. JPEG CONVERSIONThe ability of this camera (and most other cameras) to reliably downsize from RAW to JPEG is questionable.  I was hoping that this camera would create decent JPEG's where relevant (kid's birthday parties, etc.), but the colour loss and sharpness loss are too much for me.  The RAW is spectacular and you are better to do your conversions with Picasa or Lightroom.AUXILIARY FACTORSAnother reason that I purchased the camera was for the WiFi accessory.  I haven't yet purchased the accessory but I made use of it at a tradeshow.  It was amazing to take pictures and have them so quickly pop up on the laptop in a wireless fashion.  This may actually be relevant for people seeking a way to monetize their investment (portraits at a ski hill or mountain top with the ability to immediately adjust and print pictures).CONCLUSIONI feel that this camera has great value (purchased from J&R; through Amazon) for my needs.

This camera is built with speed in mind and for me it has far exceeded my expectations. When I was deciding on what to purchase I thought the 10.1 MP would be a hinderance to workflow as i'm more familiar with higher MP files. Once files where in Adobe camera Raw I almost agreed with that statement. I then tried other Raw conversation software and realized that was incorrect. I was able to crop just as much as the higher MP files. This camera restored my faith in my 24-70mm lens and now is my favorite lens paired with this camera. Though the 7d and 5d mark iii and other newer cameras have more sophisticated AF systems. I've found that this system is so simple to use that I wouldn't want to deal with those systems. This camera just gets out of your way and lets you concentrate on capturing the image. The 7d which in most cases people will say is better because of that more sophisticated AF and higher megapixels and currently at the same price point.

The first one I received from Amazon, although beyond the registration number from Canon that had problems, it didn't perform well.  Out of 1236 test wildlife photos, only about 30 were in focus.  I'm no way in the rank and file of a professional photographer, but those percentages were terribly low.  I called Canon's technical support, and they very courteous.  But I felt cheated that after spending nearly $4000, the camera had issues. Canon recommended that I return it for servicing, while my husband suggested that I return it.  Amazon's customer service was top-knotch. Readily and with no questions asked, Amazon issued a full return and within days a new camera was in my hands.  I took this one out for more testing and it seems to being fine.  Wildlife photography is my passion, so I need a camera that will respond.  I've shot with Canon's 30D and NEVER had the focusing problems that I had with this camera.  I'm going on safari in a couple of months and having gear that doesn't work - and at this price - is unacceptable.I shoot with a 100mm-400mm lens, and carrying it around can be somewhat tiring, so I'm using a Manfrotto monopod that I bought two years ago.  That makes a big difference.  I'm sure with a smaller lens, the weight wouldn't be a factor.  I've used the 100mm-400mm on the 30D for two years without feeling weighted down.  Granted the camera is much lighter than the previous model, but just something to keep in mind if you're walking around all day.The battery life is incredible.  For the previous camera, I charged the battery when I received it, and never charged it again.  As I stated, I shot the 1200+ photos, replayed and enlarged everything on the LCD.  When it was returned, it still had about 63% battery life left.  So well done to Canon for the life of this battery.  Which, by the way, is 1/2 the size and weight of the 1D Mark IIN.The burst mode is great.  When I shoot in full burst, it looks like a movie is playing.  The shutter speed is that fast.I'll do more test shots but this one seems to be OK. If you're wondering, the serial number for the camera I returned, it was in the 56000 range.  This one just above 59000.  Maybe Canon figured it out by now.All in all, I enjoy all my Canon products and the results (except for the first 1D Mark III I mentioned here).I lowered the rating by 1-star because of the focusing problems I had with the first camera.

I'm a photography student and I'm also a freelance photographer at nightclubs during weekends. This camera is amazing as you could expect from any EOS 1D. For my purposes 10 MP is more than enough as most of my pictures get downsized for Facebook but if I want to print, I can go as high as 11x14\" with no loss of quality.I will not waste your time restating what others have already said. I will just quickly tell you what the pros and cons according to my shooting style and needs (yours could be different):PROS:1) Amazing image quality.2) Solid build and weather resistant.3) Programmable ranges for aperture and shutter speed. I love how you can set it, for example, to never use a shutter speed slower than 1/8s or never use an aperture smaller than f8.4) Crop factor of 1.3X which is great for sport photographers who don't want to carry heavier lenses.5) Very usable 3200 ISO for existing light events.6) Silent mode. Great for shooting at wedding ceremonies.7) No discernible vignetting due to its crop factor.8) Records in CF and SD cards simultaneously. It's always good to know you have a back up.CONS:1) Heavy after carrying it around for 2 hours even with a shoulder strap.2) 1.3X crop factor makes it difficult to get group shots in a nightclub unless you use a 20mm lens or smaller.3) Although excellent for normal lighting conditions or a studio, the extended 6400 ISO is not as good as I need it to be for nightclub photography.I highly recommend this camera for mostly any type of photography. I love this camera but, like I said, my needs could be different than yours and I'll probably upgrade to a lighter body with a full-frame sensor suitable for higher ISO settings.

Every time I'm in the mood to do a major upgrade I always go to a camera dealer and take a look at the competition and each time I've done this I've always stayed with Canon.This camera is built like a brick.  Canon tells us they dropped some weight from the previous model, but it is still quite hefty.  Yet, it fells balanced and solid in your hands.  They've also simplified the controls and menu system and compared to the Nikon system I tested the Mark III is much easier to use.  Since I am a landscape photographer and often out before the sun is up I appreciate how easy it is to make a change on the Canon in poor lighting.  With all the knobs and dials the Nikon is a nightmare to use.The meter is excellent as is the image quality.  The camera only has 10 megapixels, but the mp's are large and pick up great image quality while holding down the noise.  Autofocus is also excellent.  They had problems with the first cameras, but later models (mine is a blue dot) don't have the problem.  The autofocus locks on moving objects quickly and maintains as the object changes course while you are firing off 10 frames per second.  Any time I've had an out of focused shot it's been due to my error.  This camera is a pro body and autofocus must be fine tuned - in other words it doesn't give you one size fits all focusing.  Take time to read the manual and some of the papers Canon publishes on their website and learn how to set up the autofocusing for different situations and you won't have any problems.The Mark IV is out now with more megapixels and a totally new autofocusing system, but according to some of the reviews, such as Pop Photo, its autofocus is not as fast as the Mark III's.

The Camera takes really awesome pictures but only in single shot and on occasion moving subjects. The problem is that you never know what the camera is going to focus on. I have tried many many settings and followed all of Canons suggestions for the AI servo and my keeper rate is very low. It just cannot seem to keep focus when following sports figures - namely football. It seems to focus in front of or jump behind at any given moment - I only use the center focus point to try to alleviate some of this. The AI servo in my opinion is broken for most of what I use it for and that is why I purchased the camera - I could have spent much less money or just kept my 40d which worked better for moving subjects, at least what I take pics of. My still pics are beautiful - but why do I need a 10 fps camera that only gets half of them in focus.  I am not entirely satisfied with the camera due to this and wish I purchased something else. The AI servo settings are overly complex and are not intuitive at all - even Canon had to send out supplements to explain how they are supposed to work - the big word is \" supposed \". If yours works fine - great - mine doesn't, Canon does not have a fix for my problem yet.

In addition, I also own a EOS 30D and a EOS 50D.The first good surprise is that this camera is NOT as heavy as you would expect from this bulky size.This is probably, at least in part, due to the fact that the battery is now smaller.Talking of the battery, it's a new generation battery and charger. The battery is smaller than the 1D predecessors, but said to last longer.By the way, if you put two batteries in the charger, it will charge one after the other and not both simultaneously. Just that you know. I did not like that.When I took the first few pictures, it still 'sounds' like a powerful camera that attracts everybody's attention with it's loud clicks. I wish Canon tries harder to make this quieter. However, in addition to the modes One Shot, and Multiple Shots, etc, they provided a mode s (silent, or slow?) that seems to delay a bit the colsure of the shutter in an attempt to reduce this mechanical noise. I tried life view without reading the manual. It's tricky to get to it and to get out of it. Autofocus won't work in life view, at least the usual auto focus by half pressing the shutter button.The buttons and control knobs at the back follow the 50D strategy, which is a good idea. you no longer need to keep pressing on a button and dial to where you want to go. Just press once and dial.Of course, you do not have the mode dial knob at the top left like the 50D. The EOS 1D Mark III is a professional grade camera. Therefore, no automatic modes for portraits, landscape, etc. You have to know what you are doing. But of course, semi automatic if also offered, like AV, where you decide the aperture, or TV where you decide the shutter speed.One interesting feeling is that the litle buttons are now stronger. Previous 1D cameras used to have these buttons softer to press. It is still comfortable to use them but I would expect a longer life, because I feel the buttons more resistant but responsive enough and comfortable to use.What about the ten pictures per second? Yes, indeed, although I did not physically count the number of pcitures per second, but I could easily feel it is higher than the 8,5 rate I had with my old EOS 1D and 1D Mark IIN.ATTENTION!!! The EOS 1D Mark III does not accept the EF-S lenses. It's a shame, because I would have liked to have the EF-S 18-200mm with this camera.Last, but not least, I took a few pictures at ISO 3200 in the room of objects of different colors and shades, with conventional light and was amazed how noiseless they are.As I said, this is not an extensive review but just first impressions.

Look up \"1D3 can't focus on a bug's nose\" for the discussion.  I was shooting bugs and couldn't get clear sharp pictures.  My other camera is a 5D which shot great closeups of bugs with my EF 300 F/2.8 and EF 500 F/4 (but with a very high focus failure rate).  It was finally decided that I needed to locate the custom function to turn off the assist points on the center focus sensor.  That made all the difference.Also, even before that, just plain old normal pictures produced truly awful jpegs.  When I reset jpeg compression to level 10 (instead of 8) that improved picture quality a great deal.Finally, I suspected level 4 sharpening (Landscape picture style) was not very sharp, so I shot a church bell tower from about 650 yards away using my 500mm and my 5D and this 1D3.  Results: the 5D landscape style (factory settings) out-shot the 1D3 landscape style (factory settings), but my custom settings of 5 for sharpening, +1 for contrast, beat the 5D and yielded an incredible picture with detail that the 5D had only hinted at, and the 1D3 Landscape setting didn't reveal at all.  Amazing what a difference a small adjustment can make.Now it is a fabulous camera and takes fabulous jpegs.  Focus is very fast, much faster than the 5D, and much more accurate.  Which is all I was hoping for.  I now have a much higher percentage of well focused, beautifully detailed images that don't need any raw processing to make them look good (and I now delete plenty of pictures for composition reasons alone).If you shoot jpegs and hate messing with raw files, and you have a 5D or other high end camera that takes great shots, better do a comparison and set up the 1D3 accordingly.  Then you'll have a very remarkable camera in the 1D3.A final note, if you want sharp pictures of bugs that don't stay put, or birds in flight, I recommend using the f/2.8 lenses over the f/4 because the auto focus sensors need it (I shoot most of my pictures in bright sunlight at f/7.1, but it's the auto focus that needs the extra light from an f/2.8 lens, not the depth of field that needs a big aperture).I haven't tried live view (I'm always outside and really don't care about live view anyway).", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best DSLR on the Market", "Author": "Imajin Studios", "ReviewID": "R3CVYZYIU21G7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Best DSLR on the market right now, lots of people have complained about its focussing issue, what they don't know is you need to calibrate the camera with all your lenses and that eliminates the focussing problem 100%", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "The AF finally works", "Author": "Lester", "ReviewID": "R38QASGT6420Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera should be on a league of it's own.

There have been numerous of test stating that 1dMk3 is better than the D3 and vice versa, but the real reason I think this camera really shines are Canon's Lenses, especially the L-series lens.  Canon has had years of making their own cmos sensors for their digital camera line compaired to other camera compines.  However, taking great pictures does not matter which camera a person has, but on the photographer it's self.Ok, it's time for me to stop promoting Canon, and start explaining why this camera is great.  I had this camera for almost half a year now.  At first the autofocus wasn't it's best, but I was able to live with it.  I don't really do sports photography, nor am I a pro photographer, and that's probably the main reasons why the autofocus didn't really bother me.  However, after I took the camera to the shop (I was lucky because the Irvine Canon factory isn't far from me) and got my 1dMk3 fixed for the autofocus problem and other problems, I have noticed a big difference in performance when I received my camera back.  My camera focuses faster and the majority of the shot I've took were useable, comparied to before.This camera does live up to it's hype and expectations.  The picture quality is great even if you're using a non L-series lens.  If you use a regular Canon lens compaired to a L-series Canon lens, it's like compairing 720p vs. 1080p on your HD Tv.  It's not really noticeable, unless you have a great eye for detail.I was dissappointed at first that the camera had one cf and one sd drive, instead of two cf drives.  Since the sd drive does take sdhc and it's cheaper.  I have no problems having one cf drive and sd drive.Anther great thing is it's new battery.  The battery does last longer.

Well the Irvine factory does clean it for free.  Also, the people at the Canon factory did state that it will take about 3 weeks to get my camera back after all the repairs are done, but instead I had received my camera back in about 1 1/2 weeks.

So far (thousands of pictures to credit) the camera is working flawlessly under some extreme (hot and dusty so far)conditions. I am a event photographer and I travel throughout the world. I started my photgraphy career with a Minolta Film 35 mm (manual) camera at age 10. I had many cameras after that (including D200 and EOS 30D) I've been photgraphing pictures for over 23 years and still trying to get that dream shot :) But for now I have a great camera to work with to get that shot.My advice is to go to a camera shop and test this camera and see for yourself. If you are some what an experienced photographer, you won't be dissappointed.", "Date": "November 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon Buyers Beware", "Author": "Karin S.

The Mark IIID was sent back for the recall to address the AF. The work they did to it negatively effected the color balance.  It was sent back to the factory.  The factory then lost my camera (having shipped it with the wrong FEDEX number). They sent another Mark III.  It had back focus problems.  In the meantime, another camera was sent as a loaner.  It was proudly pronounced in tip top shape and was new.  It arrived half packed, used, dirty sensor and dirty contacts for the lens.  The AF didn't work.  Canon believes that they didn't do anything wrong. Customer Service Rep. Elizabeth Wood responded with a litany of liability-speak but bottom line, they would only send another camera.  The MarkIII has significant AF problems, even with the firmware upgrade.  Save yourself the stress, don't buy Canon", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great camera that provides powerful capabilties", "Author": "Manuel Gonzalez \"Parroquiano\"", "ReviewID": "R2CL6KU5YLPZGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have this camera for a week now and I can only say \"Wow\"I have taken the best pictures in my life. I have have been able to shoot small kids (under 8 months) capturing the expressions, basically due to its \"Machine gun\" capability. 10 fps is best in class on its range.EOS 1Ds Mark III just appeared a couple of weeks ago and no doubt its 21 megapixels are a breeze, however I still prefer the speed of the 1D. Also this camera has 10 megapixels at 14 bits, not 12 bits, hence the colors are astonishing and crisp clear.SD and CF are very convenient. Also the way buttons are located are very convenient, however you have to get used to the new locations (I had a 400D).It is HEAVY. If you have a 28-135 II USM lens, it becomes a brick, however the photos you take are amazingNo doubt this camera is an investment that will last for, at least, 3 years.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "10Mp's and can't focus worth ......", "Author": "R.
