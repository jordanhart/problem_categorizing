Unmatched options at any price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1XSU3VR5WRAKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a 5MP camera with maximum zoom in an small package.  The Pentax Optio 555 satisfies all of these requirements and more.I had a 4MP 4X zoom but was having a hard time capturing action shots of the kids.  With the Pentax, I now have a camera half the size, 5MP and 5X zoom and the flexibility to adjust shutter speed to capture the moment.  It's no easy task getting the soccer shots of the kids as they're always moving and you need a decent zoom to get close enough.  This camera is perfect for that purpose.  So far the battery life seems excellent.  I fill up my 256MB SD card long before the battery runs out.I'm very pleased with the quality of pictures.  So far I've taken about 100 pictures.  It seems to have some difficulty in low-light conditions but it's better than my previous camera so I'm not sure it's the camera's fault.My only complaint is the 16MB included card is a joke.  It seems typical of all mfrs to include such inadequate storage so it's not unique to the Pentax but never the less frustrating.  The battery lasts forever but it also seems to take forever (~3 hours) to charge.

My second reason was the 5x zoom, followed by stronger flash and additional features to learn now to use. Saying that, there will be times I wish I had the smaller, lighter, faster Minolta G500... So it was a serious compromise that was not an easy choice - they are BOTH excellent options for a small light 'everyday' camera!Very basic - but my very first photos are here - nothing special, just really posting them so you can see the image quality - almost all done in P mode... and straight from the camera! [...] (this expires 5 Dec 2003)OK - I have never owned a digital camera before, but I have owned most recently a Nikon F100 and do know a little about film cameras...I bought it, battery took exactly 3 hours to charge...While I waited, I read the manualOh - and the first thing I did was stop all the annoying sounds by turning them all off in the user menu.The second thing I did was turn the digital zoom offI also turned the start up picture offI do not have a stop-watch - but here are some approximate times.  NOT ACCURATE TIMES, NO STOP WATCH!Sunlight/brightly lit room - I found the shot to shot time to be incredibly good - even with the flash and the pictures again were in focus with excellent lighting...Dimly lit room - wide angle - 1-3 secondsDimly lit room - full Optical zoom - 1.5 - 3 secondsTotally DARK room - wide angle - 3-5 secondsTotally DARK room - full Optical zoom - 3-6 secondsI mean TOTALLY DARK! But saying that - the photos look great, are well lit by the flash and in focus...With the zoom, it takes a bit longer to focus BUT once it gets it, it is perfect. (how, I do not know)Here are more accurate times from another review:Auto Focus LAG Wide angle:0.8 - 1.4Auto Focus LAG Telephoto0.8 - 1.5Shutter Release LAG Viewfinder0.1Shutter Release LAG LCDV1: 0.10.1 - 0.2Shot to Shot Wide angle1.8Frames per second1.1I am using the P mode and I quickly set up the User Mode as Gordon (see DP Review Pentax Forum) suggested:ISO 200AWBLow ContrastSpot FocusI have a 256 Panasonic SD card (10Mb/Second)MAX Resolution of 2592 x 1944At 1 * it is 243 picturesAt 3 *** it is 75 picturesI am switching between * and *** depending on the subject.I am looking forward to Panasonic coming out with a 2 Gig card!!!The user mode with these settings is faster than the P mode by about 1 second in the dimly lit and dark rooms.continuous mode with no flash - that was really fast too - I did not time this.PIC - Night Scene Mode - I went out at night on the streets of HK and took three pictures of the same things - P Mode, User Mode, Night Scene Mode.  What the Night Scene Mode does is really light up the whole area - I don't know how it does this, but the same photo in P mode was bright lights from the signs, and a bit dark everything else.  While with Night Scene the whole photo lights up as if with a flood light - really amazing.  At different times I would opt for P, User or Night Mode depending on my desired outcome.Physical - the case seems sturdy, the buttons are well placed, it is easy to hold and shoot.  I like the way it is easy to change what the LCD displays and to turn it off...  It is not as [nice] as the G500, but it is a nice functional, sturdy camera!OK - so this is the quick first impressions... but so far I am really enjoying it!...", "Date": "November 3, 2003"}, {"Title": "Tons of options, sharp optics, incredible camera", "Author": "J.

The menu driven software made it easy to navigate and I was up and shooting in 15 minutes.  The paltry 16MB SD memory card can only hold a few of my 5Meg picutres at a time, so plan on getting at least a 250MB card for it.  But the pics are unbelievably sharp and balanced in the auto mode.  I haven't even scratched the surface of its capabilities, but the manual mode allows you to experiment with depth of field and exposure ... it used to take a whole camera bag to house all the filters and lenses etc. that this little shirt-pocket camera has on board.I've owned digital cameras since they first came out, and the Optio 555 is a jaw-dropping, great little powerhouse.

I mean the G1 is a heck of a camera. With 2 small kids I needed a good replacement and I wanted a small versatile camera. I already had a 3mp and I wanted a compact five mp so I could keep it for a while and get my pro-sumer Big Cam fixed.I was torn between the Sony Dsc-V1, the Canon S-50 and the S-500 digital elph and this camera. Frankly I chose the pentax because the sony was too big and would be 100 dollars more plus the memory stick. The S-50 would probably be just as good or better but the pentax lens is just better than the smaller canon lens in the S-50. THe G- series lenses are fantastic but they are big and the cameras are big. Also- I was familiar with the canon and the Zoom browser software gets on your nerves repeatedly. So I paid $400 for the pentax 555 at a warehouse club and I bought a 256 SD card at an office supply store for $70.I have had the camera 3 weeks, about 500 pictures and here is my assessment so far.Pros= zoom; battery life; flash performance; color; ease of playback; unlimited movie time(only limited by SD card size; Full Manual Control if you want it.With a 3x zoom you always are left saying \"I wish I was just a little closer.\" th e5x zoom cures that. the battery lasts for days and I was extremely impressed with the flash performance on this camera. NO wash out at any distance. The colors are true as well. Manipulation may cure canon color problems but you cannot beat pentax for out of the camera colors. That movie mode is great- the canon limits to 30 seconds per movie. don't buy this or any digicam as a camcorder- but that is a superior feature really. It is immeasurable how nice it is to get true color right out of the camera. Pentax got this right on this camera.Cons: slight shutter lag; low light focus and general sharpness issues.The shutter lag is a little too much on this camera- you find yourself prefocusing so that it goes off instantaneously. Its about 80% of where it should be. The focus/ sharpness issues are correctable so thats ok.All in all, you most likely can't beat the features of this camera for the price and size. If you want a portable camera- really its thiscamera, the canon, or the sony dscv series (t1-V1). If you want a pro-sumer camera for a couple hundred more- buy the Canon G5.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "No more Stress", "Author": "Elizabeth & Colby's mommy", "ReviewID": "R4H0IWZN9PDVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recomend this camera, it takes great pictures and is very user friendly. The reason we bought this is beacause we have a very expensive minolta 35mm that never took a bad picture, that was until we got a pack of film that was bad and every single picture about 75 or so were all bad. That was not a risk I was willing to take with the birth of my first child. I bought this camera two days before my son was born and had very little time to learn how to use, but I did not need it, it is so easy to use and I took over 100 pictures, every single one came out perfect. The only thing you will need to get is a bigger SD card, I got 2, 256mb panasonic cards. I chose the panasonic cards because that is the type of card it came with. But it was only a 16mb, not enough memory. I looked at several other cameras and I chose this one because it has the aluminum case not plastic and none of the other cameras had 5x optical zoom for this price. The camera is outstanding, great build, great size, great quality!!!", "Date": "April 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "Exceptional picture quality, fast, small problems", "Author": "nick morgan", "ReviewID": "RY25NR7Q6R16Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my fourth digital camera in as many years.  Overall, this is far better than the Olympus Camedia line and the Sony DSC-W1.  I haven't had the opportunity to work with Cannon's, and I think that would be the closest contender for wht you can get in this camera.The pluses of this Pentax are the crisp, extremely accurate colors, which are, if anything, on the bright side.  But mostly they are spot on.  Secondly, the flash is fast and powerful and most importantly, the focus is extremely fast and accurate even in the flash mode.  By contrast, the Sony DSC-W1 is much slower in terms of 'locking-in' the focus in low light settings, as is the Olympus Camedia C-50. As a result, you have to be much, and i mean much steadier to get a good flash shot with the other cameras in low light settings (less so with the Olympus).  I am not - i like to whip out the camera when my kids are doing fun things and shoot three or four quick shots indoors, and my Optio shots are consistently great, while the Sony's are such a blur that many getdeleted.Another plus is the battery.  While I had selected the Sony b/c i thought i would prefer the simplicity of being able to recharge AA's anytime, or buy replacements, i found the Pentax battery extremely long lasting - something like their promo literature says, along the lines of 500-600 shots.  since it is lighter than 2 AA's, the camera overall is lighter than most running on 2-AA's.I will say, however, that it is a bit of a hassle having to carry to Pentax battery charger, when if you use the Cannon or Sony you just need to take the standard AA Ni-Mh charger, which i take along anyway for flashlights etc.  So now i often have 2 chargers, and thats a pain.Another big plus is the very quick record time for the typical full 5 mp high resolution photo.  My very unscientific method of using my watch stopwatch indicates its about .3 seconds, which was definitely faster than the Olympus or Sony.  However it compares to other cameras, its the fastest I've ever experienced, and i've never felt slowed down even in some river rafting action moments.The next thing I really like is purely subjective - the size of the lens is at least double the diameter of any compact 5 mp camera.Now that is completely subjective, but my engineering background tells me that if you double the amount of glass that light passes through, you have reason to believe you will be improving the optical clarity of your images.  somehow, for all the pictures i've blown up to 5 x 7, it seems like the Pentax photos are crisper with better color - could this be why?Another plus - excellent closeup features.  With 2 macro settings, I have always been very pleased with every kind of closeup.The drawbacks are all important to me - but when it comes time to pack a camera, unless i need the wide angle lens of the Sony DSC-W1, this Optio is hands dwon my favorite.Drawbacks:- Movie mode is an embarassment to digital photography!  try playing 320x240 on your computer and you will get eye strain! The movie looks like a moving short-cut! Check out the Sony or Kodak (and possibly some Cannon's) - they offer a resolution of 640x480 which is essential if you want to enjoy any movie clips on your computer.- the proprietary download cable is another insult designed simply to make you buy another Pentax product.  Again, take a lesson from Sony, which uses the standard mini-USB to USB cable for downloads rather than the Pentax-proprietary to USB cable.  If you lose that cable on the road, you have no way of downloading your photos and you are jammed until you can mail order another from Pentax.  If they would only have the courtesy to let you use the standard cable as Sony does, you could go to any electronics store, or use a friends.  Plus, if you carry a portable hard drive or some such thing that uses the mini-USB to USB, you will already have the download cable, while with Pentax you must carry 2 cables.-limited wide angle viweing.  the Sony has noticably better wide angle viweing, something like 28 mm, vs something like 35-50 mm in this camera, Sony also has a screw on wide angle adapter which this camera does not.- its time for Pentax to update the viewfinder.  I'm sure they are working on it, but at least another .5 inches would help this camera ALOT.- increase the size of the font of all the info in the viewfinder.  All the newer cameras with the larger viwfinders using larger font  as squinting to read critical information is just not fun.Thats my take - this camera is far better than some of the competitors, and I hope Pentax is listening and will make some improvements, as i love this extremely functional camera now, but can't wait for the next model!", "Date": "December 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not so happy with Optio 555", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3495GIF9RLTFJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased an Optio 555 in November 2003.  I read the instruction manual on the airplane on the way to Hawaii.Problems:  As I was shooting pictures using the zoom frequently outdoors, the camera would \"lock up\" and I had to turn it off to unlock it.  Must have had a software problem.  The pictures were very good within the limits of the camera.Upon returning home, I exchanged the camera for a new one.  The camera shop was very helpful.  The second camera functioned OK without any software problems.  I was not as happy with the picture quality in the second one.  I don't know if the meter was not as accurate or the white balance was not working very well.  Indoors, the color was not accurate or washed outI have returned this to the camera store and will start my search over again.I think that the camera features and ability to take good pictures is very good.  I think this is a quality control problem.  Not like Pentax normally.  Make sure you take pictures in a variety of conditions using all the functions within the time limits of the camera store's return policy just in case you have the same experience I had.On paper this is a good choice if all works well.  The 5 MP and 5X lens are what I wanted.  I haven't got a clear choice in what to buy in a compact package like this.

Good news/bad news.  Good news is that I find the 555 has all of the things that I loved about the 550 -excellent resolution, remarkably good automatic exposure even in very weird lighting situations, the VERY nice 5x optical zoom that has allowed me to get some really good \"up close & personals\" with my study birds, and downright AMAZING batery life (I took my 555 off for a week in Wales, filled up a 256 Meg card with pix -many using flash- & STILL had plenty of battery when I got home.)It also seems very rugged & forgiving (although I am keeping it away from cliff-diving grad students!.  SO, what's the bad news?  To be honest I don't see much of a difference bewteen the 550 & the 555. The lens is still slow coming out, there is still a noticeable lag between pressing the shutter release & the picture actually taking, so this definitely ISN'T the camera that you want if split-second timing is critical.

It is a little larger than many 5mp cameras but not heavier. I like that you can zoom in movie mode and the length of the movie is only limited by the size of the card.The biggest problem is the view finder is way off if you're taking photos of something within 15 feet. It gets better as you go out, but closer shots have to be done via the screen to get the actual shot you want. The battery seems to last a long time.

The camera takes great pics and I LOVE the 5x optical zoom.  The digital zoom actually works much better than my old Kodak too.  I paid $370 for the camera and would challenge anyone to find a good 5Megapixel, 5x optical zoom camera for that price!

I also bought a padded leather case for the camera ($30) so haven't had any problems with the camera not working due to jarring.

There is a special \"sunset\" mode you can use but that doesn't seem to make those pics any better.  As long as you have \"normal\" lighting (normal office setting or at a Mall, for example) you'll never notice that problem, though.

I sent my camera to Pentax and it took them over 2 months to return it to me. When I got it back the exact same problem occurred but this time I had no idea how. I've read a significant number of reviews and several users have experienced the same problems from insignificant jarring.

At this point I have no confidence in Pentax products. So one day I decided to write a complaint about my poor customer experience. I found the name of several executives who I though may care about my problems and sent them an email. A VP read my email and made sure I was compensated for the nearly 3 months I was without my camera as well as the additional $50 I spent on shipping, by sending me a new Optio 555.

It's hard to find a 5X zoom 5MP camera that is portable and where the lens fully retracts.  I don't need the 5X often, but when I do it's great to have.-Good night photos.  I'm not saying they are better than the other cameras, but the night photos are reliable.-East light adjustment settings.  Digital cameras do their best to figure out the light settings, but sometimes if the sun is behind your subject it will make your subject too dark; similarly too bright for overly sun-lit objects.  The Optio 555 lets you quickly adjust the light settings without changing to any menus.-SD card.  I prefer SD cards, because they are smaller and cheaper than everything except CF cards, which I find too large.  The complaint about the proprietary USB cable on another review is easily circumvented by a faster and easier card reader.-Long battery life.  I can easily take about 130 pictures on one battery charge.-Focus.  Fast and reliable, except in the darkest environments.-Durable!  I dropped the camera in a river (well actually I fell in the river with the camera - it was in fact in the Ardeche River which is very lovely at least) and the camera was back working more or less within a week.-Light enough.  Some other cameras have the air of durability (though they really arent) because they have heavy steel bodies.  This doesnt help the camera, and in fact can hurt it by transferring shock into the more sensitive interior.Bad points-Long turn-on/turn-off time.  It takes forever for the camera to turn on - by that I mean 3-5 long seconds.-Recharger is annoying.  I hate carrying around the recharger; i'd rather have either AA batteries or a direct plug-in.I don't know the model well, but my next purchase will be the Pentax 5X zoom/5 MP that is smaller, but I am sure has similar strengths (and weaknesses).", "Date": "May 21, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RAVGT6U8CESNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

There's no restriction on the time you can take a movie (like with the comparable Canon), and then there's the terrific, wonderful, fabulous 5X zoom that beats every other camera in its class.It's small enough to fit in a purse or a pocket and I take it everywhere.  It powers up and focuses as fast or faster as any other digital camera.  No more lost shots of the grandkids taking their first bite of brussels sprouts!

Macro and super macro shots are amazing.If you're looking for a small camera that does a great job in point and shoot situations, or if you're looking for a camera with enough bells and whistles to keep you interested, this is the one for you.  It's far better than my Canon, Nikon or Sony.  Price is dropping, too.  Sure wish I had the $$$ back I spent on my other cameras that now sit unused at home in their large, bulky camera bags full of expensive extra batteries (for the Canon and the Nikon) and obsolete, expensive memory sticks (in the case of the Sony).By the way, here's the key to capturing moving things, which is true for all digital cameras:  1. Focus; 2. Compose your shot; and 3. Shoot.  With film cameras, you compose the shot, then focus, then shoot.  Won't work in the digital world.  Second hint is use the continuous mode which will capture several shots of the same subject.  Then you get to pick the best one and delete the ones you don't like.One accessory that works great and comes in very handy is the wireless remote.

I agree with the reviewer who immediately turned the digital zoom off -- it's really kinda silly to mess with digital zoom on a digital camera, since you will probably be able to post-process the images.  I haven't found the cash yet to upgrade from the memory card that comes with it, but it's definitely high on my to-do list.  I've never seen a camera that's so easy to use right out of the box but also has so many great features.  Even the novelty features continue to amuse me almost a year after getting the camera.  The 3D photo mode is really fun to play with, and the panorama assist makes it really easy to take panoramic pictures.  And yes, it includes software to stitch the images together (semi)automatically.

The ONLY complaint I've got is that in a really saturated environment the auto-focus doesn't work very well.  A friend of mine got married recently and the auto focus refused to work at all, but I must admit the ENTIRE room was this hideous olive color, from the carpet to the fabric wall covering, and of course the completely mirrored ceiling only made the room twice as green.  Add to that the weak yellow light coming from the chandeliers, and it was understandably tough for the camera.  Finally I just switched to manual focus and put it in the continuous shoot mode and then I could just pick and choose the shots I liked and delete the rest. A couple of reviewers mentioned that the camera doesn't hold up well... I dunno about that.  Mine's been bounced around on a speedboat, fallen off a table, jerked around by the strap, and survived perfectly intact.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but I think that it holds up really well to \"normal\" wear and tear AND the occasional accident. I almost didn't get this camera because I really hate being locked into proprietary rechargable batteries.  I'd normally rather go through a bunch of AA batteries because I always worry that in 2 years the company will discontinue the battery and my product will be useless.  I've been pleasantly surprised, the battery has held up really well.  I've had the same battery almost a year and it still works for a few days with several hours of use each day between recharges.  It also holds a charge really well if I don't use the camera for a while.  And though someone complained about the 3 hour recharge time, I'm used to charging my previous [Kodak] digial camera and my camcorder overnight, so 3 hours is a HUGE improvement.(...)", "Date": "July 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "M.

I researched many cameras before adding this one to my short-list and then finally selecting it.  Note: it's almost small enough for an oxford shirt pocket but frankly it's a bit too large.  However, the small leather Pentax Optio belt pouch (sold separately) works out very well and makes it easy to carry anywhere.

When I see a camera i am interested for, I oftenly come back to amazon to check customer reviews on the certain item... and there are always a good portion of 1 star ones, unlike this Pentax having none 1 or 2 stars. (Pentax in 2003 - were Made in Japan, does that makes the difference?)Looks like it is 8 years since I use this camera, the battery still works like a new one, one charge is O.K. for a day trip with 150-200 shots taken.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!", "Author": "Osler U.
