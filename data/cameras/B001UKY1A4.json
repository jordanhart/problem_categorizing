The contact was destroyed, and I didn't want to cough up $100+ to have the security company install a replacement. So, I checked around for a replacement and came across this highly-rated alternative.The replacement is exactly the same size as the original, so it fit perfectly in the existing hole. The wire leads are a forgiving length, just in case the ends of the wires coming from the system were somehow damaged. To install this contact, I soldered the wires from the contact to the system wires, and I used heat shrink tubing to cover the soldered wire. All is back to normal.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect replacement part", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R2NPG9P2N34ONO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "needed a replacement lost part - security system would not work properly without it.  this was a perfect fit -", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic As Always", "Author": "Luis G Pacheco", "ReviewID": "R1BSPOCONSIBJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have installed these on two separate houses that are have hardwired alarm systems.
